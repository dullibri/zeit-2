Treasury Bond Prices In Rebound

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rebounded yesterday after a four-day decline, as investors showed stronger demand than expected at a $12 billion auction of five-year Treasury notes.
The 30-year Treasury bond rose about 12/32 of a point in price, or $3.75 per $1,000 in face value, pushing its yield down 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.83 percent. 
 Prices of short- and intermediate-term issues also rose, and the yield on the two-year note slipped 7 basis points, to 6.01 percent.
"Yield levels are very attractive, and investors are realizing that they're sitting on a lot of cash and should be buying," said Patrick Retzer, who manages $300 million of bonds at Heartland Advisors in Milwaukee. "The auction going well is what kept us from plunging enough to drive yields through the 7 percent level."
The Government sold five-year notes at a yield as high as 6.415 percent, less than the 6.423 percent traders expected. Yesterday's sale, initially scheduled for March 28, was delayed because Congress failed to pass a bill raising the national debt ceiling to $5.5 trillion from $4.9 trillion in time for the auction to proceed as planned.
Treasury traders warned, however, that the positive auction did not signal an end to the bond market's recent rout. The auction "restored a good tone to the market, but I don't think we've turned around all the bears," said Morton Swinsky, co-head of Treasury trading at Fuji Securities in New York. "There are still more bears than bulls."
Extending today's gain will prove difficult, said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist at First Chicago Capital Markets. "In most people's minds, 7 percent represents the ultimate objective, and it could be yields hover around these levels, between 6.75 percent and 7 percent, in the next couple of months."
Bond prices fluctuated yesterday, rising, then falling, before rebounding. Initially, bonds gained on speculation that the highest Treasury yields in seven months would attract demand at the auction, particularly from foreign investors.
"For a lot of foreign investors, today is the first day back since the big jump in Treasury yields," said David Capurro, who manages $500 million of bonds at Franklin Resources in San Mateo, Calif.
The jump in yields began Friday, when the Government reported that the economy added more jobs than expected in March, as it had in February. Now, "we think the bond market is favorably priced," Mr. Capurro said.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of five-year notes:

HEADLINE: George Jenkins, 88, Founder Of $9 Billion Grocery Chain

BYLINE: New York Times Regional Newspapers 

DATELINE: LAKELAND, Fla., April 9

 BODY:
George W. Jenkins, founder of Publix Supermarkets, the nation's ninth-largest grocery retailing chain and one of its most innovative, died on Monday at the Lakeland Regional Medical Center, a company spokeswoman said. He was 88.
Mr. Jenkins suffered a stroke and had been confined to a wheelchair since 1989. 
 Mr. Jenkins was widely known as the state's largest commercial employer and head of a chain of stores that was a leader in introducing many innovations, including electric-eye doors and frozen food cases. He was also a benefactor of many civic, educational and charitable organizations.
"George made a tremendous contribution to our business climate, but perhaps more importantly, he was a true civic leader who had a deep dedication to improving our communities," Gov. Lawton Chiles said.
Mr. Jenkins started his supermarket empire in 1930 when he opened his first store in Winter Haven with $1,300. Today the Publix chain has more than 514 supermarkets in three states and employs nearly 100,000 people. Sales exceeded $9.4 billion in 1995.
George Washington Jenkins Jr. was born Sept. 29, 1907, in Warm Springs, Ga. He was one of eight children of a general store owner. He was 12 when he started working in his father's store, which sold "everything from coffins to collar buttons," he once said.
When Mr. Jenkins was 16, the boll weevil attacked the area's cotton crops. The farmers could not afford to pay their bills, spelling economic disaster for the general store. His father moved to Atlanta to open a grocery market. A year later, the son also moved to Atlanta, briefly studying electrical engineering and then than taking a series of odd jobs.
Among them was a job working for the Piggly Wiggly grocery chain, starting as a clerk. In June 1925, he hitched a car ride and traveled to Tampa, where he went to work for another Piggly Wiggly, starting as a "broom pusher" and stock clerk making $15 a week. Within a few weeks, he was promoted to store manager of a Piggly Wiggly in St. Petersburg, a reward for hard work and long hours. He was later promoted to store manager in Winter Haven, the company's biggest store.
Four years later, the Florida boom collapsed and Mr. Jenkins's store began to fail, and the chain was sold to an operator in Atlanta.
Mr. Jenkins said he then "turned in my apron, took the money I had saved to buy a new car -- about $1,300 -- and in 1930 opened my own store next to the one I'd left."
In 1930, Mr. Jenkins formed a corporation, Publix Food Stores Inc., and by 1935 he had two stores.
Back in Lakeland, Mr. Jenkins mortgaged an orange grove for $25,000, closed his two stores, "and, in 1940, opened the prototype of the marble, tile and stucco palaces which were to follow."
The revolutionary design of that store included several features that at the time had been rarely seen in a grocery store in Florida or anywhere else: electric-eye doors that would open automatically, fluorescent lighting, air-conditioning, 11,000 square feet of selling area, wide aisles, frozen-food cases, open-air dairy cases and a paved parking lot.
Within a few years he bought J. A. Powell's Lakeland Grocery Company, with its chain of 19 All American stores, beginning the business that formed the core of the Publix chain.
The Publix chain continued to grow. In recent years, about 20 new stores were added each year. The innovations kept coming, too. Electronic scanners to read prices automatically were introduced in 1977. In 1982, Publix began putting automated bank tellers in its stores. In 1984, the chain began testing debit cards, allowing customers to pay for their food using their bank cards.
In 1940 he married Lee Savings, but she died less than two years later. The couple had no children, but Mr. Jenkins his wife's daughter from a previous marriage, Delores Socia.
In 1947, Mr. Jenkins married Anne MacGregor of Atlanta. They had six children and were divorced in 1974.
Mr. Jenkins is survived by a brother, Charles H. Jenkins Sr. of Lakeland.
In addition to Delores, who lives in Lakeland, his surviving children are Howard Jenkins of Tampa, David Jenkins of Los Angeles, Carol Jenkins Barnett of Lakeland, Julie Fancelli, of Lakeland and Italy, and Nancy Jenkins of Palm Beach, Fla., A third son, Kenneth Jenkins, died in 1974. Mr. Jenkins had 14 grandchildren and nine great granchildren.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chip Sales Indicator Falls to 5-Year Low

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 9

 BODY:
The semiconductor industry's leading indicator plunged to a new five-year low in March, reflecting the continued slowdown in personal computer sales and rapidly falling prices for memory chips.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, which is based in San Jose, Calif., today reported a book-to-bill ratio of 0.80 for the three-month period ending in March, down from a revised figure of 0.89 in February. The trade group issued its report after the close of the stock market, and analysts said it could set the stage for a selloff of semiconductor stocks. 
 In other signs of chip industry weakness, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported first-quarter earnings that fell well below analysts' expectations, and the company warned that it saw further pressure on profits. And Motorola Inc., while registering results that modestly exceeded estimates, reported declining orders in the semiconductor portion of its business.
"The manufacture of chips is going through a very difficult transition from robust, really fantasy-level growth to extreme oversupply," said Rick Whittington, an analyst with the Soundview Financial Group. "The growth last year was never as strong as we thought because of the massive inventory buildups," he said. Companies that added manufacturing capacity in anticipation of continued growth must now face declining orders while burdened with higher fixed costs and higher employee levels, he added.
Many analysts predicted last year that the semiconductor industry had escaped its normal cyclical status, and was poised for an era of virtually limitless growth, as more and more products came to depend on chips. Now, some are saying the growth last year was exaggerated by personal computer manufacturers stocking up to meet an anticipated huge surge in sales keyed to the introduction last August of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows 95 operating system. Without the surge, computer makers now have big inventories of chips to work down, sending prices plummeting.
The book-to-bill ratio compares the rate of orders with shipments, and is measured in dollars, not units, so it does reflect price shifts. Thus a ratio of 0.80 indicates that for every $100 worth of computer chips shipped, only $80 worth were ordered, an indicator of declining sales. Analysts had expected a number closer to 0.88.
In January, the ratio fell to 0.93, dropping below the break-even point of 1.00 for the first time in five years.
Semiconductor orders in March totaled $3.33 billion, down 12.5 percent from $3.81 billion in February, and a 14.5 percent drop from the $3.9 billion in new orders in the comparable period a year ago.
Shipments also fell in March, to $4.16 billion, down 3.1 percent from the $4.29 billion recorded in February, but up 23 percent from $3.39 billion in the comparable period a year earlier.
"Based upon the obvious inventory correction in the U.S. market that started at the beginning of the quarter, it's no surprise that the March book-to-bill numbers are weak," Doug Andrey, the Semiconductor Industry Association's director of information systems and finance, said in a statement. "Worldwide, however, the market outlook for the chip industry is still very bright."
Mr. Andrey cited surging worldwide sales of microprocessors, which he said should offset the slump in the United States market. But analysts said that factor primarily benefitted the Intel Corporation, the dominant supplier, and that there was little positive news for other companies.
The outlook from Advanced Micro was bleak. "The current industry-wide downturn in demand for integrated circuits in the personal computer segment makes projections about future prospects problematic," W. J. Sanders 3d, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "We do not expect an upturn in demand until those inventories have been brought down to support consumption levels."
For the quarter ended March 31, Advanced Micro reported earnings of $25.3 million, or 18 cents a share, down 70 percent from $84.3 million, or 66 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Analysts with Zacks Investment Research had estimated per-share earnings of 32 cents. Sales fell 13 percent.
Motorola reported first-quarter earnings of $384 million, or 63 cents a share, up 3.2 percent from $372 million, or 61 cents a share. Motorola said results would have been flat without a more favorable tax treatment in the most recent quarter. Analysts with First Call had estimated earnings would fall to 57 cents a share. Sales rose 16 percent.
Motorola said semiconductor sales increased 14 percent, to $2.1 billion, but that orders declined 5 percent. Operating profits for the chip business were higher but would have been flat except for a net gain realized from a real estate transaction, the company said.
Both Advanced Micro and Motorola reported their results after the stock market closed today.

HEADLINE: Stadium Plan Would Scuttle M.T.A. Hopes

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
The proposal to build a baseball stadium on the West Side of Manhattan would kill the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's longstanding plan to develop the site and generate millions of dollars for transit improvements.
The M.T.A. owns the site, the railyard west of Penn Station. A consultant's report, praised by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, estimated the cost of the stadium at $1 billion, but that figure includes no money for buying the site from the M.T.A. 
 Some authority officials worry that the stadium proposal could lead to a standoff between the city and the M.T.A., like the one that has stalled redevelopment of the Coliseum site on Columbus Circle for years.
Worse, they fear that Gov. George E. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani, eager to keep the Yankees from going to New Jersey, will force the M.T.A. to give up the property with little or no compensation, sacrificing money that could have gone toward projects like renovating stations, modernizing signals and acquiring trains and buses.
E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A. chairman, said yesterday that such concerns were premature, and that determining which agencies would profit from a stadium and to what extent is "light-years away." He said he had been consulted about building a stadium on a platform above the railyard, but he would not say by whom or to what extent.
"The conversations are not of a nature that I can discuss," he said.
For more than a decade, the M.T.A. has harbored visions of development above the railyards, with the profits going to capital improvements in its subway, bus and commuter rail network. Though the real estate market has been weak for years, the potential for such sources of income has become especially important to the authority in the last year, as city, state and Federal subsidies for transit have been cut.
Mr. Conway said he considered the stadium proposal exciting, and dismissed the previous development plans for the site as "something that's not going to happen." Though real estate developers' views of the M.T.A.'s prospects for building above the railyards were not generally positive, Mr. Conway's assessment nevertheless came as a surprise to many other M.T.A. officials.
Several officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were concerned that the authority had barely been consulted about a stadium, even though the city and state commissioned a study of the site, and the state has been considering the idea of a stadium over the rail yard since 1993.
While city officials have talked avidly of striking a deal with the Yankees in which the city would receive a share of stadium revenues, there has been no mention of any of that money going to the transit system. Like Mr. Conway, John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and an M.T.A. board member, said yesterday through a spokeswoman that such talk would be premature.
But one M.T.A. official said: "It's not premature for the city to talk about what to do with this property, and it's not premature for the city to talk about making money off it. But for some reason, it's premature to include the agency that owns the property in any of this. What does that tell you about their intentions?"
The M.T.A. spent $196 million building the railyard between 10th and 12th Avenues and 30th and 33d Streets. It lies well below street level and most of it is open to the sky. Completed in 1987, it allowed Long Island Rail Road trains to be stored, cleaned and repaired at a site near Penn Station between their morning and evening runs, rather than shuttling back and forth during the day from Manhattan to yards in Queens and on Long Island.
The yard was designed to accommodate pillars that would support an enormous concrete deck above it and buildings atop the deck. The plan was to turn it over to a developer and collect part of the builder's lease income.
The M.T.A. drafted a proposal to turn the site, plus the block north of 33d Street and west of 11th Avenue, into a mini-city, with 8.3 million square feet of office and retail space, a 718-room hotel, 3,600 residential units and two parks. That proposal, which M.T.A. officials concede was probably too optimistic, was completed in 1989, just in time for the real estate market in New York City to take a nosedive from which it has only partly recovered.
Mr. Conway, appointed chairman last year by Mr. Pataki, derided the plan as unrealistic and said the authority had long since abandoned it.
But some current M.T.A. officials, along with others who recently left the agency, said that as far as they knew, it had merely been shelved, waiting for a healthier real estate market. They said they still thought the site could generate several million dollars in annual income.
"As far as I knew, it was still very much on the radar screen," a current executive said. "It's a valuable asset that we've invested a lot in, and even if it's not ripe for development in the current climate, that doesn't mean it won't be in a couple of years."
Lewis Rudin, a major developer and property manager, agreed cautiously. "In this market, it wouldn't happen," he said. "But it very well could be a developable property in a few years." Even if the site cannot be developed, it is rare that one governmental agency would take the asset of another without compensation.
The west 30's, where an old post office is being converted to a soaring new Penn Station, with shops and restaurants, is not an attractive place for offices and homes, he said. "That new Penn Station might be the impetus that it needs," he said. "The Javits Center was supposed to be, and it wasn't."
But Edward S. Gordon, a major commercial real estate broker, said any prospect for developing the site "is so many years off it isn't worth discussing."
Real estate professionals agreed, however, that a new baseball stadium would be just the sort of catalyst that would make the rest of the neighborhood desirable, sparking a building boom there.
Ultimately, what kind of deal is struck for the right to build over the rail yards will depend on the Governor and the Mayor. The Governor appoints six of the M.T.A. board members including the chairman, and they often vote as a bloc in accordance with Mr. Pataki's wishes, giving them effective control of the 14-vote board. Mr. Giuliani's appointees hold another four votes, who also tend to vote as a bloc, so when the two groups are allied, they hold an insurmountable majority.
Louis R. Tomson, the Governor's liaison to the M.T.A., said Mr. Pataki has not taken a position on the stadium proposal or on the authority's role in it. But the Governor has strongly expressed a desire to keep the Yankees in New York.
The city, the state and the Yankees commissioned a study by the architectural firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum on options for a new or renovated stadium for the team. The option favored in the report was a multi-use, 70,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof, above the rail yard, between 11th and 12th avenues, for $1.06 billion.
But while the analysis included costs for the immense platform above the tracks, highway improvements, parking and other considerations, it made no mention of the M.T.A.
Transit advocates said they feared a stadium could actually become an expense for the M.T.A., because it would require new bus routes to the stadium, perhaps even a new trolley or subway line. And, they said, it is clear that Mr. Giuliani is behind the project.
"This site should be a revenue source for the M.T.A., and it looks like they want to turn it into a revenue drain," said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign. "It seems like the mayor's last thought in this entire affair is its impact on the transit system."

HEADLINE: 13 Cattle Quarantined in Mad Cow Disease

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 9

 BODY:
Thirteen head of New York cattle have been placed under quarantine by state agriculture officials because of concerns they could be carrying mad cow disease, although there is no evidence the animals are infected.
The State Department of Agriculture and Markets is negotiating with three farmers to destroy the animals, which were imported from Britain before the Federal Government placed an embargo on British cattle in 1989. 
 Two of the cattle are in Cobleskill in Schoharie County; 10 are in Stormville, Dutchess County, and 1 is in Holcomb, near Rochester. The cost of buying and destroying the cattle is put at around $90,000, and Gov. George E. Pataki said the money would be made available.
"We have a tentative deal at that price for all 13," the Agriculture and Markets Commissioner, Donald R. Davidsen, said today. "We're in the process of getting the papers around and getting them signed. I'm hopeful that these animals will be ours to be put down this week."
In addition to the actions in New York, 20 other states began ordering the killing of British cattle.
Some of the cows in New York are used for breeding and others are pets. Mr. Davidsen said they were examined twice a year by the Federal Department of Agriculture and found to be healthy. But he said just the potential hazard to humans is reason enough to destroy them.
"It seems like an appropriate thing to do," Mr. Davidsen said. "Maybe we're erring on the side of prudence, but now's the time to do this."
In Britain, mad cow disease has been linked to a rare brain disease in humans.

HEADLINE: Quayle Gets Cool Welcome in Russia

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 9

 BODY:
On his first trip to Russia, former Vice President Dan Quayle discovered that the friendship between this country and the United States is beginning to fray.
Mr. Quayle, who now lectures and writes a syndicated column, delivered a buoyant speech today about democracy and the future of nuclear security to the Russian Academy of Sciences. But his elderly, distinguished audience of mostly sociologists and historians wanted to teach him a thing or two about international relations. 
 "You can't tell Russia what its position should be on the NATO issue," Grigory L. Bondarevsky, a political scientist, chided. Even though Mr. Quayle had not raised the issue of NATO expansion, Mr. Bondarevsky was one of several specialists who complained about it.
The political scientist also took Mr. Quayle to task for the United States military aid to Pakistan, for not doing enough to stop Islamic terrorism, and for raising the issue of democracy in Russia while "failing to bring it up in your relations with China."
"I was not expecting it," Mr. Quayle said afterward. "I welcomed it. It showed me that there are some very sensitive political issues here."
Mr. Quayle, who said he wanted to acquaint himself with Russia's political climate and gather material for his speeches and columns, arrived in Moscow on Monday for four days of private meetings with Russian politicians and leading public figures, under the auspices of the American University in Moscow.
But his encounter at the Russian Academy of Sciences gave him a strong dose of the new, somewhat sour mood infecting Russian society.
"His speech wasn't too bad," Mr. Bondarevsky said grudgingly after the meeting. "But it was a little simple. It was all right as a campaign speech, but not for here. We expect a higher standard."
In his speech, Mr. Quayle argued that a return to a socialist economy in Russia would only result in "shared poverty," while free market reform would eventually lead to "greater prosperity."
But Mr. Quayle also offered a brash new proposal for resolving security issues, suggesting that the "six powers" of the world -- the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, China and India -- form a new kind of security council to discuss nuclear safety and ways to stop the spread of chemical, biological and atomic weapons.
Mr. Quayle told his audience, "This does not mean that the United Nations should be replaced, nor will it prevent any country of acting in its own interest, but it will provide a more effective forum for discussing these crucial issues."
In an interview later, he explained that given the tensions between Russia and the West over expanding NATO to include some of the former Warsaw Pact countries, his plan could help ease Russia's concerns over exclusion.
"It gets people thinking about nuclear arrangements and international relationships Russia could and should have," he said. "I wanted to talk about ways to include Russia and emphasize its importance."
American officials in Moscow said they had not previously heard of Mr. Quayle's proposal, and found it "baffling" because "it could lead to a duplication of effort."
But some Russians found it encouraging. "It's not a bad idea," said Sergei Rogov, director of the Institute for USA and Canada studies.
Mr. Quayle said the six-power security group was an idea he had flirted with while Vice President, but had not advanced publicly because it was not favored by the Bush Administration. He decided to try it out in Russia. "I figured, let's put something new out there instead of just rehashing what they have basically heard in the past," he said.
After two days in town, Mr. Quayle said he was surprised by the amount of construction going on in Moscow, particularly by the restoration of Christ the Savior Cathedral near the Kremlin. "That would have been unthinkable a few years ago," he said.
In Moscow, Mr. Quayle also discovered that the access to top officials he once had as Vice President had lessened since leaving office; several meetings he had scheduled for today and Monday were canceled at the last minute. He said he was not sure whether he would meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin, or his main challenger in the Russian election in June, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, who left town today on a campaign trip.
Mr. Quayle expressed wry amusement over the sudden cancellation of his meeting with Igor Malashenko, the chief executive of the privately owned television network, NTV. Mr. Malashenko, who will keep his job while he advises Mr. Yeltsin's campaign, was summoned to a campaign strategy meeting.
"Can you imagine Dan Rather working for Clinton?" he asked. "It's not yet what we would call a free press."

HEADLINE: Smokers More Likely to Bear Retarded Babies, Study Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 9

 BODY:
Pregnant women who smoke are 50 percent more likely to have mentally retarded children, according to a study released today.
Smoking during pregnancy was previously linked to low birth weight, infant mortality and lower intelligence in children. This study was the first to connect smoking with retardation, said Dr. Carolyn D. Drews, an associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University who headed the research. 
"I certainly think there is more study that's needed," Dr. Drews said. "If these data represent a true finding, it's one more reason for women to stop smoking during pregnancy."
The researchers interviewed the mothers of 221 Atlanta-area children with mental retardation of an unknown cause and 400 other mothers in a control group.
The study, published in the April issue of Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, found:
*Women who smoked while pregnant were 50 percent more likely to have mentally retarded children.
*About 35 percent of women who gave birth to retarded children reported smoking as few as five cigarettes a week during pregnancy.
*Women who smoked during the last six months of pregnancy, when a fetus develops many organs, were 60 percent more likely to have retarded children than women who did not smoke then.
*Pregnant women who smoked at least a pack of cigarettes a day were 85 percent more likely to give birth to a retarded child.
The researchers considered children retarded if their I.Q. was lower than 70 when they were 10 years old.
About 24 percent of women without mentally retarded children said they had smoked while pregnant, according to the study conducted by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Batelle Centers for Public Health Practice and Education, both in Atlanta.
The researchers factored in elements believed to increase the chance of mental retardation, like the mother's age, economic status, education and alcohol use.
Dr. Julian Ullman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, called the study very disturbing. "There's no question it's another reason for women to stop smoking," he said.

HEADLINE: Senate Contenders in Boston Fight to a Draw in a Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 9

 BODY:
Around this time of year in Massachusetts, public attention generally turns to two beloved pastimes, baseball and political campaigns. Alas, the Red Sox began the season losing five of six games on the road, and snow on Monday canceled the team's home opener in Fenway Park.
There were no such disappointments across town on Monday night in Faneuil Hall, where Senator John Kerry and Gov. William F. Weld squared off in a rousing hourlong debate of Senate candidates that revealed broad differences in style and views of government. 
 As the first in a series of scheduled encounters between the Democratic incumbent and his Republican challenger, the debate was televised live throughout the state. But the race has drawn interest well beyond Massachusetts, because both candidates have wide appeal with voters and national party leaders, and each is eager to appear as the more reasonable and moderate alternative at a time of heightened partisanship in Washington.
With more than six months before the election and recent polls showing Mr. Kerry holding only a narrow lead, neither candidate declared himself a flat-out winner of the debate. That was left to surrogates, like Paul Cellucci, the Republican Lieutenant Governor, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry's Democratic colleague, , whose analyses suggested that they had watched different debates.
Rather, after fielding questions from reporters during the first half-hour and from each other in the livelier second, each candidate pronounced himself satisfied that he made his points.
Despite the obvious foreign policy challenges posed by China and Russia and trade with Japan, the debate focused almost entirely on domestic issues, reflecting statewide concern over a changing national economy, job insecurity and the growing disparity between haves and have-nots.
While the candidates disagreed on approaches to almost everything and many exchanges devolved into noisy charges and countercharges over the impact of tax and social proposals, the larger themes that have given each man a national profile emerged quickly: Mr. Weld as a strong proponent of a small-sized Government minimally involved in people's lives, and Mr. Kerry as a defender of maintaining Government programs for the less fortunate.
Mr. Weld took ample opportunity to trumpet his favorite campaign issues of welfare reform, lower taxes and tougher measures to fight crime -- all hallmarks of his six years in office -- and to paint Mr. Kerry, who is seeking a third term, as an entrenched Washington insider. Mr. Kerry presented himself as a champion of the people who played a major role in helping pass the 1994 crime bill and chided Mr. Weld for his spiritual kinship to Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia.
Their differences were especially evident when a reporter asked Mr. Weld why he thought people were poor. It gave the Governor the chance to highlight his administration's welfare policies, which are regarded as the most stringent of any state in the country.
"A whole knot of problems" causes poverty, Mr. Weld allowed, but foremost among them, he said, is "the welfare culture we have had the last 40 years in this country."
Mr. Kerry used that response to attack Mr. Weld for opposing an increase in the minimum wage and for favoring the Republicans' original proposal of $270 billion in reduced Medicare spending over seven years to finance $245 billion in tax cuts.
Later, in the evening's most poignant moment, Mr. Weld called attention to his support for the death penalty -- and Mr. Kerry's opposition -- by pointing to Ann Schavina of Springfield, Mass., whose son, Michael, a police officer, was killed in the line of duty. With Mrs. Schavina sitting in the audience, Mr. Weld asked Mr. Kerry "to tell her why the life of the man who murdered her son is worth more than the life of her son, the police officer."
The hall grew silent.
"It's not worth more," said Mr. Kerry, a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war."It's not worth anything. It's scum that ought to be thrown into jail for the rest of its life to learn day after day the pain and hell of living with the loss of freedom and the crime committed.
"But the fact is, Governor, that, yes, I have been opposed to the death penalty. I know something about killing, and I don't think a state honors life by turning around and sanctioning killing."
For Mr. Weld, who lowered the expectations of his supporters by predicting, "the debate will have a loser and it'll probably be me," the evening was at least a stylistic success. He was assertive, even forceful in defending policies and criticizing Mr. Kerry, once pounding the lectern to make a point. But Kerry supporters said Mr. Weld's volume merely helped make their candidate look more senatorial.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Mixed as Dow Drops 33.96 Points

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market turned mixed yesterday after Monday's sharp decline. The Dow Jones industrial average continued to move downward, but advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Monday, the Dow tumbled 88.51 points in reaction to Labor Department data that companies added 140,000 new jobs to their payrolls in March, more than had been expected. This was the second consecutive month that a robust Labor Department employment report caused a major selloff; on March 8, the average dropped 171 points, the largest percentage decline in four years. 
 The market tried to stabilize yesterday, but the Dow industrials nevertheless weakened, sinking 33.96 points, to 5,560.41. A broader indicator, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, declined 2.05 points, to 642.19.
"Early in the session, hopes ran high that the market would lift, but the rally was short-lived," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president of Fahnestock & Company. "Uncertainties about corporate earnings, interest rates and inflation curbed optimism somewhat."
However, strength in some technology issues helped to raise the Nasdaq composite index by 3.49 points, to 1,109.15. Advancing Big Board issues exceeded decliners by 1,401 to 969. And volume inched up to 426.8 million shares, from 421.9 million shares on Monday.
This week's slump in the Dow was attributed by analysts to a resurgence in economic growth, with a related fear of inflation. Among the 30 blue-chip Dow stocks, big losses were suffered by American Express, off 1 3/8, to 47 3/8; Procter & Gamble, down 1 5/8, to 83, and United Technologies, off 1 1/2, to 110 3/8.
Mortgage companies were lower amid concerns over their profit margins. Federal National Mortgage, known as Fannie Mae, fell 1 7/8, to 31, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage, known as Freddie Mac, slipped 2 5/8, to 84 1/2.
Tobacco stocks also finished in minus territory, as traders worried about litigation prospects. Philip Morris closed at 89 3/8, down 1 1/4; RJR Nabisco ended at 29 3/4, off 3/8, and UST finished trading at 31 3/4, down 3/8.
Gold issues turned lower in line with gold prices. Newmont Mining slid 1 3/8, to 57 7/8; Echo Bay Mines dropped 1/8, to 13 7/8, and Barrick Gold gave up 3/8, to 31.
Some airline stocks were higher, with the Dow Jones transportation average adding 3.29 points, to 2,171.23. Delta Air Lines rose 3/8, to 80 1/2; Trans World Airlines gained 5/8, to 22 1/8, and Alaska Air advanced 1/2, to 29 5/8.
Oil service issues remained strong. Schlumberger closed at 86, up 1 3/4; Sonat Offshore finished at 54, up 3 3/4, and Baker Hughes ended at 29 5/8, up 1.
Paper stocks also did well. Georgia-Pacific jumped 1 1/4, to 70; Boise Cascade gained 3/8, to 41 1/4, and International Paper rose 3/4, to 39 1/4.

HEADLINE: Rehnquist Joins Fray on Rulings, Defending Judicial Independence

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, as oblique as some other Federal judges have been direct in response to the recent tide of political criticism of sitting judges and their decisions, said today that the country's history demonstrated how important it was that Federal judges should never be threatened with removal because of their rulings.
Judicial independence is "one of the crown jewels of our system of government," the Chief Justice said in a speech at the law school of American University here. While judges should not be above criticism, he said, the "guiding principle of the House of Representatives and the Senate" from the earliest years has been that impeachment and removal of judges should be reserved for criminal conduct and not judicial acts. 
 The Chief Justice, who wrote a book on this theme in 1992 and has spoken frequently about judicial independence, did not refer explicitly to the current context in which attacking Federal judges has become an early theme of the Presidential election campaign.
But because the question of rulings from the bench and judicial selection have become campaign issues, the remarks of Chief Justice Rehnquist took on added resonance.
Indeed, Senator Bob Dole the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, suggested during a campaign appearance last month that a Federal District Judge in New York, Harold Baer Jr., should be impeached for a ruling that evidence in a drug case was the product of an invalid search by the New York City police in Washington Heights and could not be used in court.
President Clinton's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, at the same time refused to rule out the possibility that the President might seek Judge Baer's resignation. The judge last week reversed his initial ruling after a new hearing.
In a highly unusual statement issued on March 28 by the chief judge of the Federal appeals court in New York, Jon O. Newman, and three of his predecessors labeled the criticism of Judge Baer an "extraordinary intimidation."
If Chief Justice Rehnquist meant to refer in his speech to these events, he did so by delicate indirection. He recounted, as he did in his 1992 book, "Grand Inquests" (William Morrow), the 1805 Senate trial of Justice Samuel Chase, who had been impeached by the House of Representatives for several rulings he made while sitting as a trial judge.
While a majority of the Senators convicted Justice Chase on one impeachment count, the vote fell short of the necessary two-thirds.
"This decision by the Senate was enormously important in securing the kind of judicial independence contemplated by Article III" of the Constitution, Chief Justice Rehnquist said in the text of his speech tonight at the centennial celebration of the Washington College of Law, the law school of American University.
He said the episode gave much-needed "assurance to Federal judges that their judicial acts -- their rulings from the bench -- would not be a basis for removal from office by impeachment and conviction. And that has been the guiding principle of the House of Representatives and the Senate from that day to this; Federal judges have been impeached and convicted -- happily, only a very few -- but it has been for criminal conduct such as tax evasion, perjury, and the like."
In his discussion of historical threats to judicial independence, the Chief Justice also evoked President Franklin D. Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Court. The plan, which the Senate rejected in 1937, was Roosevelt's effort to gain control of a hostile Supreme Court and would have permitted him to expand the Court's membership to as many as 15 Justices.
"Although Roosevelt lost that battle," the Chief Justice said, "he eventually won the war by serving three full terms as President and appointing eight of the nine members of the Court. This simply shows that there is a wrong way and a right way to go about putting a popular imprint on the judiciary."

HEADLINE: Focus Is Jobs At Expo for 50-Plus Set

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
IN this era of downsizing, what do people 50 and older want most?
Jobs, say the organizers of the Fifty Plus Expo, which will take place on Sunday and Monday at the Crowne Plaza Hotel at 48th Street and Broadway. 
 While the symposium will include workshops on health, exercise, investing and even sex, 16 of the 50 seminars will be devoted to ways of figuring out new career options.
"The reality is that people 50 and older are the most vulnerable group in the employment world, the highest paid, the most experienced and the first to go when the mergers take place and the companies are being downsized," said Julie Frank, the producer of the conference. "The world, however, is a good world, if they're prepared to be creative and flexible."
Although the symposium is not a job fair, Ms. Frank said, there will be information about opportunities. "Gap Kids is looking to hire people over 50 to work in their stores," she said, "and two companies who do medical billing will be looking for people to buy their franchises, because people can do this work out of their homes."
What is clearly a growing occupation is home health care. "In anything to do with the aging population, there is projected to be growth," said Kate Wendleton, the director of the Five O'Clock Club, a national group that teaches strategies in job searches; she will also speak at the symposium. Health-care companies are expected to need salespeople, administrators and financial experts.
The key to finding a job is flexibility and preparation, Ms. Wendleton said. You should plan to spend at least two months studying your target industry as if you were in graduate school, she added.
Even people who are in their 40's and employed are not safe from downsizing, said Dr. Lydia Bronte, a gerontologist and the author of "The Longevity Factor" (HarperCollins, 1993). "If you're in your 40's, you should start making alternative plans for yourself," she said, "because if you're caught in downsizing, you have an idea of what you want to do."
Health will also be an issue at the symposium. Dr. Christine K. Cassel, the chairwoman of the department of geriatrics at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, says she will urge people in their 80's and 90's (and, of course, younger) to swim or take brisk walks of about two miles a day, four or five times a week. "Physical activity staves off osteoporosis, improves cardiac function, lowers blood pressure and maintains postural stability," she said.
Admission to the symposium is $10 a day; $2 discount coupons are available at Duane Reade drugstores. Information: (212) 631-7547.

HEADLINE: The Korea Divide

BYLINE: By Selig S. Harrison; Selig S. Harrison is a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
North Korea's dangerous posturing in the demilitarized zone has dramatized the need to replace the 1953 armistice, which has kept a shaky peace between the two Koreas, with a new system that reflects post-cold-war realignments.
When the pact was signed, the North was a military base for the Soviet Union and China. Now Russia and China have much closer economic and political ties with South Korea than with the North, and the North has urgently sought to normalize relations with the United States. 
 Kim Jong Il's regime has scrupulously honored its 1994 nuclear-freeze agreement with Washington, and has just agreed to discuss American concerns about its missile program next week in Berlin.
For two years, North Korea has appealed in vain for talks at Panmunjom with American generals on ways to replace the armistice with a more stable system -- one that is compatible with the improved relations envisioned in the nuclear-freeze accord. In 1995, the Pentagon did permit preliminary low-level contacts with North Korean officers in the DMZ. But pressed by Seoul, which opposes closer ties between America and the North, Washington called off the talks in September before any generals met.
Shortly after this, I met with Gen. Ri Chan Bok, the North Korean Army's representative at Panmunjom. His Government , he said, wants a two-track peacekeeping system in which a Mutual Security Commission composed of military officers from North Korea and America would operate alongside the North-South Military Commission, which was negotiated in 1992 but never instituted.
North Korea no longer insists on a peace treaty with America that excludes the South, he said, but it does believe that the armistice must be replaced and that American forces should remain in the South on their own rather than under the United Nations Command.
Explaining this significant reversal of policy on American forces, another official told me: "We must think of the impact of the withdrawal of U. S. troops on the balance of power in the region. We are particularly concerned that if U. S. troops pull out of Korea, Japan will rearm immediately."
Currently, 35,000 American troops are in the South to defend it against aggression, but the North now wants them to stabilize the entire Korean peninsula. The system that the North proposes "will help to prevent any threat to peace from either the South or North," said Kang Sok Ju, the First Deputy Foreign Minister.
America wants the North to talk with the South about replacing the armistice, even though the South did not sign it. Pyongyang is justified in arguing that Washington must participate in new peacekeeping arrangements. By the same token, Washington should insist that all military issues involving only the two Koreas must be handled by the projected North-South Military Commission.
Instead of refusing to talk with the North at the DMZ, America should put forward the terms under which it would be willing to replace the armistice, phase out the United Nations Command and set up a new system. America could insist that a trilateral coordinating body be established so that the North could not drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul. Above all, America could propose tension-reduction measures, including a three-way agreement to reduce offensive weapons along the 38th parallel.
The Clinton Administration cannot ask the Security Council to wind up the United Nations role unless the concerns that led the United Nations to intervene are addressed in meaningful arms control arrangements.

HEADLINE: Eonomic Scene;
No growth, no inflation is fine for bonds but how about people?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
A CHILLING rise in interest rates has grabbed the financial headlines in recent weeks. But for many Americans who are not shopping for a mortgage or speculating on the price of the 30-year Treasury bond, what matters are the bread and butter issues: economic growth, jobs, consumer prices. And by those criteria, the auguries still look pretty good.
How does this cheery view square with the anxious bond market? Either the market is "wrong" in the sense that it has overreacted to insubstantial data hinting at inflation ahead, or the interests of bond owners are currently at odds with those of people who earn their bread in offices, stores and factories. 
 Start with the explanation for what has been called a correction in the bond market, which has pushed up long-term yields to an eight-month high -- almost a full percentage point since January. George Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution, argues that bond traders are responding to three factors that could signal rising inflation: the virtual collapse of prospects for deficit reduction anytime soon, the upward creep of grain and oil prices, and the rapid growth in employment in the first quarter of 1996.
With hindsight, it is hard to imagine why so many people expected a deficit deal in an election year. But it would have been asking a lot of bond traders to predict the future better than professional politicians. And it is likely that budget problems will sustain what many economists see as long-term interest rates that are well above the historical norm. Score one for the bond market.
On the other hand, inflation fears driven by food and fuel prices seem unwarranted. Commodity prices, notes Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, are indeed at an eight-year high. But commodities simply are not a large enough component for changes of this magnitude to make a big difference in the overall cost of living. Nor are rising prices buttressed by underlying constraints on capacity or rising production costs that would suggest more increases ahead.
As important, there is little evidence suggesting that higher commodity prices are being factored into the inflationary expectations of business or labor. "We've had anecdotal reports of wage pressures for the last three or four years," Mr. Steinberg says, "but no numbers showing wages rising faster than productivity."
Of course, the proximate cause of tumbling bond prices was the report of spectacular growth in jobs in February and the unexpected strength of the labor market in the March data, which were released last week. If employment continues to grow at a rate even close to the 400,000 average for these two months -- triple the actual growth of the working age population -- the Federal Reserve would undoubtedly intervene to cool the economy by raising interest rates.
But here, too, Mr. Steinberg thinks the bond market has become carried away. The meaning of the new numbers is in doubt because of problems of adjusting for seasonal changes in employment, especially in the winter. He notes that one need not look back any further than the first quarter of 1995 to find comparably strong employment statistics that coincided with very modest rates of economic growth.
At worst, then, the bond market is reacting to unanticipated strength in the economy, which will be squashed once the Fed recognizes the phenomenon and tightens credit. More likely, Mr. Perry argues, the numbers are simply confirming that the economy is bouncing back from a pause in growth that just a few months ago seemed to presage a recession.
What's missing from the instant analysis of this burp in bond prices -- indeed, what has been missing for several years in comparable events -- has been a sense of priorities. The bond market is indifferent to economic growth or employment or the distribution of income. Virtually all that matters to the pricing of Treasury securities (and other bonds that are virtually free of risk of default) is the expected rate of inflation. The best of possible worlds for bond owners is one with slow growth and rock-stable prices, which is not the best of circumstances for anyone else.
Economists and most policy makers understand this, but in recent years it has been convenient to ignore the obvious. One of the few ways anyone suffers immediate pain from big budget deficits is through lower bond prices and higher mortgage rates. Hence those who see deficit reduction as the ultimate policy challenge in a myopic political environment have welcomed the casual adoption of bond prices as an index of economic health.
The risk is that policy makers will forget that their association with bond speculators is merely a marriage of convenience. Actually, it's more than a risk: Consider the defensive tone of the Clinton Administration in announcing that 750,000 jobs have been created in the last two months.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
New Pieces Of the Past For 2 Held In Bombing

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Why did they do it, if they did it? Hints have been emerging since the arrests of Timothy James McVeigh and Terry Lynn Nichols in the bomb explosion that destroyed the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Now, with the approach of the first anniversary of the worst mass murder in American history, ABC News adds new details from interviews with the accused men's family members and buddies to draw the fullest profiles that television has yet offered.
In large part, they seem to be off-the-rack case histories: Both came from poor and broken families. By society's standards and perhaps their own, both were failures. Both were drawn to conspiracy theories that attributed their hardships to nefarious and all-powerful forces. 
 "Rage and Betrayal: The Lives of Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols" begins in childhood. Most attention is given to Mr. McVeigh. His father, Bill McVeigh, interviewed by Peter Jennings, tells of a "regular" family life, with Tim as the most enterprising of his three children. But when Tim was 16, his mother left home, a desertion that Mr. Jennings cites, a touch glibly perhaps, as a turning point: "He took to guns and what is sometimes called survivalism."
Only in the Army did the young man find success, for a time, along with a kindred spirit in the shape of Terry Nichols, whose hatred of Washington is attributed to the loss of the family farm in the 1980's. By the time he joined the Army, Mr. Jennings says, "He was already a three-time loser: as a farmer, as a salesman and as a husband." He found ideological comfort in a fringe group known as the Patriot Movement.
Somewhere along his rocky path, Mr. McVeigh discovered "The Turner Diaries," a novel about resistance to the United States Government that was becoming a bible of the far-far radical right. Mr. Jennings quotes a passage: "We drive a truck into the main freight entrance of the F.B.I. building and blow it up . . . we can wreak havoc in all the offices . . . several hundred people will be killed."
The program suggests that the killing of a White Separatist's wife and child in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992 and the storming of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex., in 1993 lighted the fuse for the Oklahoma City explosion. The buildup of rage until it became betrayal is plausible and disturbing: Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols have plenty of company among Americans who have been hit by family breakdown, economic pressures and bad luck and are susceptible to the rant of talk radio and the constructions of conspiracy mongers. It only confirms the laws of probability that one or two of them should have acted out their anger and their fantasies.
 
Dateline NBC
Oklahoma City: One Year Later'
NBC, Friday night at 9
Back in his home state for the first time since the bombing, Bill Moyers talks with survivors and people who lost children and parents in the blast. Along with giving the victims their say and stirring viewer sympathies, Mr. Moyers is out to make the point that the bombing was a political act, fueled by hatemongers, against the Federal Government and all its works.
Unlike the ABC program, the evidence here consists mainly of the star's preachments and the victims' feelings. The hour becomes more of a report with the brief appearance of members of the Oklahoma Citizens Militia and, especially, two young men who have fled the violence of city life and what they see as Government corruption. But mostly it's a duet between Mr. Moyers and the good people.
In some of tomorrow night's exchanges, the interviewer might as well be interviewing himself. He asks a HUD employee, "Do you like your work?" She replies, "Yes, I do, I do." He follows up, "What about it do you like?" She replies, "I like being able to help people." He comments: "And people like you used to be known as public servants. And now you're referred to as graceless bureaucrats." Although fairly new to "Dateline," Mr. Moyers proves a quick study of the newsmagazine style.

HEADLINE: Productivity In 1995 Was Best in 3 Years

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
Productivity in the American workplace had its best showing in three years last year but was faltering as the year ended.
Many analysts say that productivity rebounded slightly in the quarter just ended, held back by winter weather and the effects of a strike at General Motors that rippled through related industries like suppliers. 
 Robert G. Dederick, an economic consultant at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said big employment gains in February and March combined with continued sluggish output to keep productivity from growing faster. He cited "the impact of the weather and the G.M. strike."
Nonfarm productivity -- output per number of hours worked -- grew 1.1 percent in 1995, the largest gain since a 3.2 percent advance in 1992, the Labor Department said today.
While that was well above the previous two years, growth was less than half the annual increases in the 1950's and 1960's. Productivity increased just two-tenths of 1 percent in 1993 and five-tenths of 1 percent in 1994.
Many economists consider productivity a key element of Americans' standard of living, asserting that increased efficiency means that businesses can increase their workers' pay without having to raise prices. With a lack of productivity, businesses would be reluctant to increase prices to pay for higher wages, fearing that the added cost would price their products out of the market.
Economists argue over the cause of recent productivity gains. Some contend that the improvement results from greater efficiency as businesses reduce and restructure their work forces and invest in high technology. Others maintain that it is a result of the economic recovery and that as the business cycle levels off, productivity gains will slow.
Output rose 2.7 percent in 1995 after jumping 4 percent a year earlier, while hours worked were up 1.6 percent following a 3.4 percent advance.
But in the final three months of 1995, productivity slumped 1 percent as output dropped sharply, to a seasonally adjusted rate of six-tenths of 1 percent growth from 4.7 percent in the July-September quarter. Hours worked rose at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent, down from 2.9 percent in the third quarter.
Unit labor costs, typically two-thirds of the cost of a product, increased 2.5 percent, faster than the gains of 1.6 percent in 1994 and 2.1 percent in 1993. In the fourth quarter, they were accelerating at a 3.8 percent rate.
Hourly compensation rose seven-tenths of 1 percent during the year when adjusted for inflation, including a rate of four-tenths of a percent from October through December.
The report showed that productivity in manufacturing remained relatively strong, increasing 3.7 percent during the year compared with 4.2 percent in 1994. Factory productivity had grown 2.1 percent in 1993.

HEADLINE: Wild Pitch

BYLINE: By Roger G. Noll; Roger G. Noll is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Even at a time when major league sports have become a cartoon of financial excess, the proposed new home for the Yankees is breathtaking in its audacity. Excluding land value, a multipurpose mausoleum on Manhattan's West Side would cost a billion dollars.
The debate has centered on two questions: Are sports facilities economically worthwhile? And should the stadium be single-purpose or multipurpose? A more fundamental question is why cities provide large subsidies to teams in the first place. 
 The Yankees have little economic effect on New York City. True, most fans would never visit the South Bronx were it not for the team. But few tourists come to New York just to see the Yankees. Thus, the Yankees generate a huge increase in economic activity within 100 yards of the Stadium, but not within the metropolitan area.
Nearly all spending at the Stadium is simply shifted from other forms of entertainment like restaurants and movies. Yes, the Yankees do draw suburbanites into the city, but many of these people would spend money in Manhattan or go to Mets games if the Yankees were not an option.
The city does make money by taxing tickets and concessions, but such revenues wouldn't come close to covering the Stadium's debt service. Even if the Jets agreed to play their home games on the West Side and the two teams combined drew four million fans a year, the city would need to collect an unrealistic $20 in taxes from each fan just to meet the mortgage payments.
 Independent studies of sports facilities invariably conclude that they provide no significant economic benefits. A sports team does increase overall income in a community slightly, but the increase never offsets the stadium's financing and operating costs. And because a team has relatively few (but very highly paid) employees, it usually causes overall employment in a city to fall because it can drive other entertainment businesses to cut back or close.
Stadiums are bad investments, which is why the teams themselves are never willing to pay for them. New York City would generate more cash by putting the money in a savings account.
Assuming that New York decides to build the stadium, a multipurpose facility would make the most financial sense -- if the Jets and Yankees would agree to share it, which is unlikely. Single-purpose stadiums are more attractive and draw more fans. And the teams want their own stadiums so they can control and profit from other events in them. The city, of course, gains nothing by letting the teams have their way.
Why do cities pour hundreds of millions into new stadiums? With intense competition for sports franchises, not even New York can keep a team without subsidizing it. New Jersey and New York have at various times fought over the Giants, Jets, Yankees and Mets. The sad thing is that the states need not be competitors: Fans could easily support a third team in both football and baseball. But each league is a monopoly, doing what monopolists do best: making the product scarce to hike up the price.
There is a far cheaper way to keep the Yankees. Bribe them. A new stadium could give the Yankees an additional $10 million in profits each year. So instead of spending $80 million annually to finance and operate a new stadium, New York could just hand the Yankees $10 million. Or, even better, the city could pay $100,000 for each game won, with a million-dollar bonus for winning the pennant.
This plan would save the city money, improve the Yankees' bottom line and benefit fans, who would be less likely to have a team that collapsed in the stretch.

HEADLINE: Toronto-Dominion to Buy Waterhouse Investor Services

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
Toronto-Dominion Bank said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Waterhouse Investor Services, which operates a chain of discount brokerage offices in the United States, in a stock-and-cash deal valued at about $525 million.
Under the proposal, holders of Waterhouse stock could choose either to receive $38 a share in cash or to exchange each Waterhouse share for $38 of Toronto-Dominion common stock. But Toronto-Dominion will not redeem more than 35 percent of Waterhouse's outstanding stock for cash, the companies said. 
 Waterhouse's stock surged after the deal was announced, gaining $3.25 to close at $36.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Toronto-Dominion's shares slipped 50 cents (Canadian) to close at $23.50 .
Waterhouse Investor Services, which operates 79 branch offices in 37 states and the District of Columbia, is among the largest discount brokers in the United States. Green Investor Services, a discount brokerage chain owned by Toronto-Dominion Bank, controls more than 70 percent of discount transactions in that country.
Waterhouse and Green Line will continue to operate under their current names. Together, the two concerns will have more than one million North American customers, said W. Keith Gray, the chairman of Green Line.
Mr. Grey added that over the last few months Toronto-Dominion had been actively seeking to acquire a discount brokerage business in the United States.
"The U.S. is the world's largest economy and it is going to be a great opportunity for the growth of our discount brokerage," he said.
The companies said that current management personnel would not be affected and added they they did not anticipate any layoffs due to the merger.
Lawrence M. Waterhouse, Jr., the founder of the firm that bears his name, will continue as its chairman and chief executive, the company said.
"We believe that Green Line's proven leadership as the largest discount broker in Canada, its commitment to customer service and its state-of-the-art technology will make this a winning business combination," Mr. Waterhouse said.
The $525 million purchase price paid for Waterhouse by Toronto-Dominion represents nearly 21 times the company's earnings.
The merger will be tax-free to holders of Waterhouse stock if they choose to receive Toronto-Dominion common shares in exchange for their existing shares.
In addition, Toronto-Dominion said that it would seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange for its common shares. The bank said it would account for the merger as a purchase transaction and said that it did not expect that it would dilute earnings either this year or the next.

HEADLINE: A Lawsuit in Japan Seeks to Ban Noisy Night Flights at U.S. Base

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 10

 BODY:
More than 3,100 Japanese who live near an American air base filed a lawsuit today against the Japanese and American Governments, demanding a ban on night flights and $30 million in damages.
The suit, while unlikely to succeed, is the first of its kind against the United States Government. It sours the atmosphere a bit in the prelude to President Clinton's state visit to Japan next week to hail the American-Japanese security partnership. 
 Those who brought the suit, who live near the Yokota base in the Tokyo suburbs, said they would also protest during Mr. Clinton's visit over noise on the base.
Still, such opposition to American bases is not expected to undermine seriously the American-Japanese summit meeting. Indeed, other recent events -- like the Chinese military exercises in the Taiwan Strait and the North Korean intrusions into the demilitarized zone -- seem to have bolstered support for the American military presence in Japan.
Mr. Clinton's visit, from Tuesday to Thursday, is not expected to focus on the trade disputes that have often divided the two countries. Instead, the summit meeting is to accentuate the positive and reaffirm mutual support for the security relationship between the two most powerful economies in the world.
In particular, the two leaders are expected to endorse efforts to make the American military bases less of a nuisance to their Japanese neighbors, particularly on the southern island of Okinawa. Opposition among Okinawans to the bases, which take up 20 percent of their island, surged after the rape of a sixth-grade Okinawan girl last fall. Three American servicemen were convicted in a Japanese court for the attack.
"We have taken the outrage in Okinawa as a signal that the United States and Japan must very seriously look at our presence on Okinawa in a way that reduces irritants," Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador in Tokyo, said today. Mr. Mondale said he expected "one of the most solid state visits in the history of the relationship."
While the strongest opposition to American bases has been on Okinawa, the suit filed today came from people living in the greater Tokyo area. The Yokota base is one of the most important American installations in Japan, but it is in a residential area and the neighbors complain in particular about the noise from night flights.
The plaintiffs in the suit are demanding a ban on flights between 9 P.M. and 7 A.M., as well as $30 million in damages. In the past, local residents have sued the Japanese Government for failing to protect them from the noise. In 1993 the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that they could win compensation from the Japanese Government, but it refused to order a ban on night flights because it said they arose from the United States-Japan Security Treaty and were beyond the jurisdiction of the courts.

HEADLINE: Need to Cut Costs? Order Out;
Outsourcing Saves Money, but Labor Is Frustrated

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: ASHEVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
The anti-lock brake systems look out of place as they slide by almost silently on conveyor belts at the ITT Industries factory here. From the spotless white floors to the cool, filtered air to the young workers in white hair nets and white plastic laboratory coats, the factory seems more suited to the production of computer components than auto parts.
Far different are the cavernous buildings in Dayton, Ohio, filled with endless rows of clanking, roaring machinery, where the General Motors Corporation makes brakes for nearly all its cars and trucks. A few rusting fans hang from the exposed support beams, the only relief when temperatures soar above 100 degrees in the summer. The floors are concrete painted black, and the air smells of oil and sweat. The workers, mostly graying men in their 40's and 50's, wear greasy orange jump suits or blue jeans -- and nobody has a hairnet. 
 Across America, executives at big companies like G.M. are looking at their less efficient operations with dismay and trying to find ways to buy more parts from low-cost outside vendors like ITT. By buying more of their parts, executives can save money and keep their businesses competitive; for them, the difference between G.M.'s factories in Dayton and ITT's plant here is the difference between yesterday and tomorrow.
But for many workers, the executives' tomorrow is a frightening prospect. G.M.'s unionized employees in Dayton earn about $19 an hour, and when they get sick they can go to almost any doctor, paying no deductible and a minuscule co-payment. ITT's nonunion workers earn $9.90 an hour and choose their doctors from the lists of two health maintenance organizations.
The contrast between the two brake plants makes stark the logic that has compelled so many manufacturers to shift jobs to low-cost, outside suppliers over the last decade, as well as the uphill -- if not quixotic -- resistance from labor unions.
Because of the United Automobile Workers union's success in driving up wages and benefits at the Big Three auto makers, the savings from buying outside parts are especially large in the auto industry. Wages and fringe benefits at the average auto parts factory are only a third of what the Big Three pay their unionized workers. As a result, the parts industry has become a front line in the battle between management and labor over corporate downsizing.
But outsourcing is a prime cost-saving strategy throughout the economy, from the insurance company that replaces its security guards and cafeteria workers with outside contractors to manufacturing giants like the Boeing Company, which buys airplane parts from factories in Japan, Mexico and Xian, China, that its own employees once fabricated in the United States.
With the most to lose, labor unions have fought a largely unsuccessful rear guard action against the shifting of jobs to outside contractors. In settling a strike last year, Boeing pledged only to look for other jobs for workers displaced by foreign parts purchases and to notify its union of future plans for the purchase of outside parts.
Similarly, the 17-day strike last month at G.M.'s Dayton brake factories stemmed largely from worker objections to four G.M. contracts to buy outside brake parts. G.M. settled the strike with a pledge to hire 417 more workers in Dayton and inform the union about future plans for parts purchases; the four contracts remain in place.
Indeed, Timothy D. Leuliette, the president of ITT Industries' automotive operations, declared in a speech earlier this year that it was inevitable that auto makers would buy more parts from outside suppliers, because the public was demanding affordable cars. "Fighting to defend higher-cost jobs in an industry undergoing strategic restructuring ultimately can have little success," Mr. Leuliette said.
The U.A.W. contends that the problem lies with corporations that would rather turn to outside vendors than invest the money in their old factories.
"They're fooling themselves when they say we've got to compete with other factories that have the best techniques, that have the best manufacturing processes," said Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W. vice president who oversees relations with G.M. "They have an obligation to put money in the plants."
The issues are seldom drawn as clearly as by comparing ITT's factory here with G.M.'s two brake plants in Dayton.
Morale is high at the ITT factory, partly because of a collegial relationship between managers and the nonunionized workers. Walk the immaculate factory floor here and the cheerfulness is unmistakable.
"I like it a lot," said Deanna Cayton, a 26-year-old worker who paused as she assembled brake valves. "The people are great, the work's not hard; it's clean, very clean."
W. Steve Dickerson, the plant manager here, dresses much like his workers, wearing a short-sleeve green polo shirt on one recent day and putting on a hairnet and white plastic laboratory coat before going on the factory floor. He knows the workers by name and talks easily with them about their families.
ITT manufactures brakes for all the Big Three auto makers. When the factory won a Ford Motor Company quality award last year, ITT spent $50,000 on a lavish party in which Mr. Dickerson and other managers dressed in tuxedos and served roast beef to the 900 workers.
Yet ITT's intentions in throwing the party were not just philanthropic. "In the next two weeks, we picked up $200,000 in productivity," Mr. Dickerson said.
Even before last month's strike, morale was terrible in Dayton. Some workers there refer to the factories as the "state prison." They labor under the watchful eye of security guards and foremen. Few workers smile or wave as Daniel E. Warrell, the factory manager, strides by in his dark blue pin stripe suit.
The floors in Dayton are filthy, with oily slime in spots. When an aide to Mr. Warrell reached down recently to pick up an oil-sodden, crushed cardboard box in an aisle, the factory manager waved him away. "That's O.K.," he said. He later apologized for his factory's dirty appearance, for which he blamed the need to bring production back to normal quickly after the strike.
Another reason is that Dayton factories do produce some mechanical parts not made in Asheville, contributing to difference in noise and dirt between the factories.
While the Dayton factories had a cookout last year, there were no parties or big staff gatherings when the strike ended. "Management had meetings," Mr. Warrell said, but relied on the foremen to talk to the assembly workers.
The sheer complexity of the union work rules agreed to by management over the years at the G.M. factories make management's own job much more difficult. Partly because the Dayton factories produce a wider range of parts, but mostly because of the work rules, the G.M. brake operations have 35 different categories of semiskilled workers, including those who work on the assembly line. There are also 16 categories of skilled workers, like electricians.
ITT has only two categories of semiskilled workers in Asheville, and skilled workers are on salary. The company buys most of its equipment from outside vendors and asks employees to change work assignments frequently, partly to keep their jobs interesting. "We never get into 'It's not my job,' " Mr. Dickerson said.
The difference in labor-management relations is particularly striking when it comes to the sharing of information.
In Dayton, one of the strikers' demands was that G.M. begin telling them more about future brake plans. But in Asheville, without strikes or union contracts, Mr. Dickerson makes monthly presentations to assembly line workers. He provided a detailed appraisal in late March of the factory's contracts and business plans for the next several years, even discussing a $650 million Ford contract that ITT did not disclose publicly until the following week.
But while the Asheville factory may offer a much more pleasant, open work environment, the pay and benefits are considerably inferior to G.M.'s. Workers in Dayton earn an average of $69,000 a year, including close to $30,000 in overtime from working six- and seven-day weeks. ITT's workers earn around $20,000 a year, with little overtime available.
Yet the workers here have few complaints about their pay. One of the reasons is a basic shift in American society: the young, married employees typically have working spouses, so they have two incomes to support their households. By contrast, many U.A.W. workers in Dayton still support their families on a single paycheck.
But the bigger reason for workers' acceptance of lower pay here is that the burden of history weighs much less heavily on Asheville, where pay scales have long been much lower than in the industrial Midwest.
The Asheville factory stands on land that used to belong to the Biltmore Estate, which surrounds the 250-room French chateau built in 1895 by George Vanderbilt as a bucolic summer retreat. ITT was the first big auto parts company to build a factory in the area, setting up operations in 1989. The main competitor then for industrial workers was a Burlington Industries textile factory that paid $7.50 an hour and closed in 1991. At $9.90 an hour, the wages at ITT seem generous.
"The pay is great," said Malina Mcasee, a 39-year-old former Burlington worker, as she used tweezers to insert a pin into each anti-lock brake passing on the assembly line. The health care benefits are also the best in the area, said Ms. Cayton, who is expecting a baby in mid-May.
The burden of history is very different at G.M.'s factories. Dayton has been a high-wage, unionized town of skilled industrial workers for generations. One of the G.M. plants bears a small historical marker noting that the Wright Brothers built some of their first commercial airplanes at the site.
In the late 1980's, G.M. was a pioneer in making anti-lock brakes, and the units turned out by the Dayton factories rely more on mechanical parts than the electronic gear at the heart of ITT's slightly less expensive but equally reliable brakes.
Now, G.M. plans to install a "clean room" production line for highly sophisticated electronic brakes inside one of the Dayton plants by 1998. And while that will not eliminate the differences between the Dayton and Asheville operations, it likely means more U.A.W. members will be wearing hairnets.

HEADLINE: HOUSE PROUD;
The Challenge: Life in 35 Rooms

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON-ON-HUDSON , N.Y.

 BODY:
ONE day this winter, Helena C. Doley was noting how her snow-covered view would turn leafy green come spring. Then she winced. Her eyes had wandered from the picturesque scenery outside the Palladian glass doors in the dining room to the wall above, and settled on a seeping white foamy mass that had stained the crimson paint on the wall.
"Honey, did you see this?" she called, stifling a screech. Her husband, Harold, entered the spacious but tenebrous dining room and took up the lament. "And we just fixed the roof," he said. 
 For the last three years, the Doleys have been restoring Villa Lewaro, the 35-room country house of Madam C. J. Walker, as she called herself, who made a fortune in the early 1900's with her hair-growing cream and other hair-care products for women of color. She was the first black woman to become a millionaire in the United States. The legend of her stellar business success and taste for opulence lives on, not least in her country home, which was named for her daughter, A'Lelia Walker Robinson.
The three-story cream-colored Renaissance revival house was begun in 1916 by Vertner Woodson Tandy, New York State's first registered black architect; it cost about $250,000 to build and was completed in 1918, just a year before Madam Walker's death at 51.
Madam Walker's legend fascinated Mr. Doley, a New Orleans stockbroker. "She was a genius," he said, "and to walk the halls that she once walked and to sleep in the room where she once slept is a feeling that is indescribable."
The Doleys and their 18-year-old son, Aaron, have had to work to carve out personal space for themselves in what amounts to a palace.
Even for a family used to grand living -- Mr. Doley is an investment banker and a former United States ambassador and executive director of African Development Bank and Fund in Abidjan, Ivory Coast -- it is not easy for three people to settle into 35 rooms.
Although they have a show-stopping dining room, whose arched ceiling is adorned with just-restored miniature erotic aquatic scenes painted on canvas, family members usually eat their meals in the kitchen, a vast room with an institutional-size oven and refrigerator. They spend much of their time in the third-floor family room, where they have a large-screen television and billiard table. When they first moved in, they had to try their luck among its eight and a half bathrooms to find enough working showers and sinks for the three of them: most of the plumbing was not operational.
They learned quickly that a house that big can be hotter than a thousand Julys in the summer and as cold as an empty church in the dead of winter. They also learned quickly that a roof leak may go undetected for weeks if the family does not frequent certain rooms.
"I don't know how long it had been since I had been in the dining room before discovering the leak," Mrs. Doley said. "What's stranger is that I may have just overlooked it for weeks. There are so many walls here."
The couple is comfortably installed in the master bedroom, for which Mrs. Doley chose seven carefully modulated shades of gray. The master bath is still equipped with a "needle" shower that was installed by Madam Walker. Surrounded by three-quarters of a circle of spray, the bather has the feeling of being in a Jacuzzi, Mr. Doley said.
"It has been an agony of love," said Mr. Doley, 49. "I'm dealing with a passion here. I knew it was going to be a difficult task, but it's been much more involved than I originally expected."
Indeed, Mr. Doley's passion for the house runs deeper than his wife's. He was the one who had coveted the mansion for more than a decade, quietly visiting its grounds as he made plans to acquire it when he was still in training to become a broker on the New York Stock Exchange.
He felt a connection with Madam Walker, a shrewd investor as well as a great political advocate who spoke out against lynchings and provided crucial financial support to the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
He finally bought the home in 1993, after bargaining for two and a half years, he said. But his wife cried in terror over the prospect of maintaining such a dwelling. And she cried again when they moved in. But she has been converted -- and a live-in butler helps with the day-to-day running of things.
Mrs. Doley, 49, a guidance counselor at the Mount Pleasant Cottage School in Pleasantville, is overseeing the interior decorating, consulting Madam Walker's great-great-granddaughter, A'Lelia Perry Bundles, as well as archives and history books for details of the original decor. Careful not to allow the home to become her raison d'etre, she said, she decorates one room at a time, which accounts for the its sparse furnishings. A wrong decorating move would be like pouring flat beer into a champagne flute.
"Part of the thing that keeps me going is seeing little projects come to fruition," she said. "That gets you ready for the next project."
In spite of its age, the house is well preserved because it has changed hands only a few times. When Madam Walker's daughter -- whose legendary parties kept the house roaring all through the 1920's -- died in 1931, she left Villa Lewaro to the N.A.A.C.P., which sold it in 1932 to a fraternal organization.
In the 1980's, a developer wanted to buy the house, level it and build condominiums. But it was saved by a 250-year-old Chinese ginkgo and a 300-year-old American beechnut, the very trees that had originally lured Madam Walker to the property: the village has an ordinance that protects trees. It is now on the National Register of Historic Places.
The next owners began the restoration effort, rebuilding the portico, recasting delicate plaster decorations missing from the ceilings and determining original colors.
When Madam Walker was building the house, she created a stir. "Impossible," residents exclaimed, according to an article in The New York Times Magazine on Nov. 4, 1917. "No woman of her race could afford such a place."
Madam Walker built the house as a showpiece, and with the help of eight servants she used it for entertaining prominent people of her day, especially the politically active. She also built it as proof of what an ambitious person could accomplish.
Born Sarah Breedlove to former slaves in 1867 in a cabin in the northern Louisiana hamlet of Delta, Madam Walker started out in hardship; both her parents had died by the time she was 7. She first married at 14 and worked as a laundress.
But as she labored over washtubs, larger questions began to haunt her, she said later -- "What are you going to do when your back gets stiff and you are old? Who is going to look after you and your little girl?"
Later, she would tell audiences fascinated by her ascent that the answer came in a dream in which a secret hair-conditioning formula was revealed. She spent years trying to realize that dream, finally successfully marketing her Wonderful Hair Grower and other products. Black women made the products an instant success. (C. J. Walker was her second husband.)
Madam Walker's operation was based in Indianapolis, but in 1912 she made her home in Harlem. Tandy designed an Adam-style town house for her on West 136th Street, complete with a beauty salon and school on the ground floor and three floors of living space. But Villa Lewaro was his greatest work.
The house in all its splendor sits right on Broadway, the main street of Irvington. The crescent-shaped, columned portico is flanked by two pavilions with Spanish tile hip roofs.
Along the fashionable summer-home strip, Madam Walker's three-story basic stucco house stood out from the other brick Tudor-style mansions of the Tiffanys, Rockefellers, Biddles and Carnegies.
"The real estate agents made her pay the 'black dollar,' meaning when they found out she was black, they charged her double what the land was worth in an effort to stop the purchase," said Mr. Doley, noting that she paid $60,000 for the land. "I think she wanted it close to the street because you had to pass this way on the way to Albany. And everyone who passed by had to see this house."
"At times you get the sense that you are living in a museum," Mr. Doley said. "The other day, someone rang the bell to ask if they could have a tour of the house. We were in the middle of dinner. I have no regrets about owning the house, but sometimes it can be very overwhelming."
Mrs. Doley added: "It's our home as well as a historic landmark. We have to find a happy medium between what is authentic for the house versus what is comfortable for us."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Still Receiving Big Cash Flow

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
While stock and bond markets continued to suffer a rough patch yesterday, evidence mounted that investors were not losing their appetites for stock and bond mutual funds. Far from it: A mutual fund trade group estimated that investors poured more cash into stock and bond funds in the first quarter of 1996 than in the first nine months of last year.
The Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, estimated that stock and bond funds took in a net $23 billion in March. While that was down slightly from February's total, it also supported contentions by mutual fund companies that individual investors did not flee the markets after a sharp decline in stock prices early last month. 
 "Investors have had a very minimal reaction to short-term drops in the stock market," said Mark Geist, president of Montgomery Asset Management, a fund company based in San Francisco. While the company may see cash flows slow down for a day or two in reaction to short-term trends like that seen in the last few days, Mr. Geist said, "it's really not enough to take notice of. Of course, we haven't had a long-term drop to test the resolve of investors."
Yesterday, however, stocks continued to follow bonds lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 74.43 points, to 5,485.98, the fourth straight decline in the market bellwether. In the last four trading sessions, the Dow industrials declined 3.6 percent, with most of the loss coming since Friday, when the Labor Department reported that for the second month, American companies added more jobs last month than analysts expected. [Page D8.]
Bond prices fell to drive the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 6.94 percent from 6.83 percent -- the closest the benchmark measure of long-term interest rates has been to 7 percent since last August. Prices and yields move in opposite directions from each other. [Page D18.]
While it is too early to tell whether the most recent downturn in the market will have any effect, a newsletter that tracks mutual funds says that a record amount of money flowed into stock funds in the first week of April. In any case, the rising tide of cash into mutual funds shows no sign of weakening. Even executives at fund companies have expressed surprise over the strength of the trend, and market analysts have puzzled over the source of those waves of fresh cash.
In addition to the possibility that investors have simply started saving more, another source may stem from tax refunds, which appear to be significantly higher this year than last. The Internal Revenue Service has certified tax refunds to individuals totaling $52 billion through the end of March, a 25 percent increase from 1995's level.
The stock market's activity over the last two months, while volatile, has followed a discernible pattern. Since the beginning of February, when the Dow industrials first moved above 5,400, the benchmark has traded in a range from 5,450 to 5,700. Each time the index has approached one of those ends, it has bounced in the opposite direction, making four full round trips.
That has not troubled investors, however. Most of the mutual fund cash has been flowing to stocks lately. In March, mutual funds that invest primarily in stocks took in a net $21 billion, down slightly from $21.9 billion in February and $28.9 billion in January. The first-quarter total of $71.8 billion was more than three times the net cash inflow of last year's first quarter and more than funds took in in the first seven months of 1995.
Bond funds, meanwhile, took in a net $2 billion in March, the institute estimated, about even with February's inflows but down from January's $4.3 billion of net inflows.
Together, the estimated total inflows to stock and bond funds of $80 billion in the first quarter exceeded that of any previous quarter. The former record, of $63.6 billion, was set in the third quarter of 1993, when stock and bond funds were gathering assets at a roughly equal rate.
While the most recent estimates indicate a slight slowing of demand for mutual funds since the first of the year, that is not a surprise, analysts say. Typically, the first month of each quarter is the strongest, because companies often transfer payments to retirement programs on a quarterly basis. January is typically the biggest month of all, because of annual payments into those programs. And the first quarter is generally stronger than later quarters because individuals often make contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts during that time.
One fund tracker, however, said that cash flows in the first week of April were even higher than in March -- indeed, higher than any other week in history. Market Trim Tabs, a newsletter based in Santa Rosa, Calif., reported that in the week ended April 4, stock funds took in a record $6.2 billion, above the previous weekly record of $5.2 billion, set in the first week of January.
"The liquidity measures are still very bullish," said Kevin Kelleher, research director for the newsletter. Nor have short-term market declines, like the sharp drop in stock prices in early March, worried investors. "While flows do fall off after drops like that, the market has shown it is pretty resilient, and investors come back in."
Investment analysts have also puzzled in the last week over a report from the Federal Reserve that raises questions about whether individuals truly are putting more money than ever into the stock market. The Fed's recently released Flow of Funds report shows that in 1995, total stock market activity by all sources resulted in a net sale of corporate equities of $14.1 billion.
Households have been net sellers of corporate equities nearly every year since the mid-1950's, so the fact that their sales increased last year, to $168 billion from $138 billion the previous year, is not surprising.
But the report also shows that net purchases of corporate equities by mutual funds fell to $86 billion last year, from $107 billion in 1994 and $117 billion in 1993.
According to the data from the Investment Company Institute, net inflows of cash to equity mutual funds totaled $128 billion last year, up from $119 billion the previous year. Over the same period, equity mutual funds decreased the percentage of cash they held in their portfolios, to 7.9 percent last year from 8.5 percent in 1994.
Mr. Kelleher said that the Federal Reserve data were open to broad interpretation. For example, he said, the household category contains equity of all sorts.
"If you are an individual who owns your own grocery store and you sell it, that will show up in the report" as a sale of corporate equity, he said. But the data also show that mutual funds hold a growing portion of all corporate equities, and, as Mr. Kelleher noted, funds own mostly publicly traded stocks.
According to the Fed report, mutual funds owned 13 percent of the $8.3 trillion in corporate equities in American markets last year, up from 7 percent in 1994 and 5 percent in 1993. Over the same period, the percentage held by households has remained about even, at 51 percent, while the percentage held by private pension plans has fallen to 14 percent from 17 percent in 1994 and 22 percent the previous year.

Treasury Prices Post Sharp Drop

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday on growing concerns that inflation could accelerate.
The source of the market's new-found anxiety about inflation is the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities, which is at eight-year highs. Yesterday, the index rose 3.09 points, to 258.91, led by a surge in wheat prices. Higher energy prices have also worried investors. 
 While several spikes in the bureau's index in recent years have not been accompanied by a marked increase in inflation, market participants are concerned that the recent rise in commodity prices will ultimately be passed along by producers and retailers, leading to higher consumer prices.
"It's just a matter of time until inflation picks up a bit," said Cary Leahey, senior vice president at Lehman Government Securities.
The concern about inflation comes ahead of Government reports today on producer prices and tomorrow on consumer prices. Inflation is a bond investor's worst enemy because it erodes the returns on the investment.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 18/32 , to 887/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.94 percent, from 6.83 percent on Tuesday. Prices of shorter-term maturities also fell, with the yield on the two-year note rising to 6.11 percent, from 6.01 percent on Tuesday.
"The market is in the process of discounting some expected future inflationary pressures," said David Jones, vice chairman at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company.
The possibility of higher inflation has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep monetary policy steady for a while. Some analysts expect the central bank's next move will be to increase short-term interest rates.
"I do believe that the next time they change policy it will be in the direction of restraint," Mr. Jones said.
Traders said they were disappointed with a long-awaited coupon pass by the Federal Reserve yesterday, saying the Fed had delayed its action for too long.
A coupon pass occurs when the Fed comes to the market to buy certain maturities to add cash to the banking system. While it is not a signal of any change in monetary policy, traders say, the coupon pass presents dealers with an opportunity to sell Treasury securities to a ready buyer.
"The market had so much anticipation for it that when it actually happened it was kind of a disappointment," said Waldo Best, senior economist at BZW Government Securities Inc.
The Fed bought coupons with maturities from May 15, 2003, through Feb. 15, 2026, for delivery today.
The purchases failed to ease concerns about supply as the market tries to absorb more than $30 billion in new Treasury notes. The Treasury auctioned two-year notes on Monday and five-year notes on Tuesday. And another $30.25 billion of securities are expected to be sold later this month.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Ad Takes Aim At Clinton On Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
Trying to mine taxpayers' misery, the Republican National Committee began assaulting President Clinton in television advertisements today for blocking a tax credit supported by the Republican-controlled Congress.
The advertisements began appearing in some of the same television markets as others, sponsored by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, in which Republican representatives came under fire for voting to block an increase in the minimum wage. 
 Both sets of advertisements feature youngish men in flannel shirts, appearing in kitchens adorned with children's scrawled drawings. And both illustrate how legislative battles are serving this year as proxies for the Presidential one, allowing Republicans and Democrats to define their differences without putting into effect the spending restrictions that apply to advertising explicitly tied to the Presidential campaign.
In the districts in which they appear, both sets of commercials are modified to include the names of local representatives, praising or deriding them for their votes. But the Republican advertisement also names Mr. Clinton.
As in Democratic advertisements attacking the presumptive Republican nominee, Senator Bob Dole, the Republicans dispense with honorifics.
"What about the thousand-dollar tax credit for the two kids?" asks the flannel-clad man in the Republican advertisement.
"Clinton vetoed that," replies his apparent wife, a thirtyish woman with a blond ponytail. "Between the two of us, what I make goes just to support the Government."
That advertisement is appearing in 22 states, part of a campaign that the Republicans said was costing just less than $1.5 million. A second advertisement, which the Republican National Committee said was appearing in far fewer states, accuses Mr. Clinton of breaking his promise "to end welfare as we know it."
Ann F. Lewis, Mr. Clinton's deputy campaign manager, said, "If the Republican National Committee wants to frame this campaign as a campaign about economic policy, I would welcome that."
She said the tax commercial was misleading because it did not mention Republican plans to "cut Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment" while the welfare advertisement was "factually inaccurate."
In the welfare commercial, the announcer declares that Mr. Clinton "is blocking efforts to replace welfare with work." In fact, Ms. Lewis said, Mr. Clinton has repeatedly supported such efforts.
While the Democratic National Committee has been advertising since last fall, the Republicans have not broadcast advertising since early December, allowing Republican Presidential candidates to compete in the primaries with their own advertising.
The union advertisement, which began on Tuesday and is to run through April 15, does not mention Democrats or Republicans. "Our Congressman voted to block a minimum wage increase," the flannel-clad man says, addressing the camera, "after he voted to cut Medicare and cut college loans, and to give a tax break to the rich."
But of the 21 representatives who are targeted in versions of the advertisement, only one is a Democrat, G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery of Mississippi, who has announced his retirement. Almost all the others are embattled Republican freshmen. The advertisement also dovetails with commercials broadcast for months by the Democrats, presenting Mr. Clinton as the bulwark against a Republican onslaught against programs like Medicare.

HEADLINE: Male Professors Keep 30% Lead In Pay Over Women, Study Says

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
The salary gap between female and male university professors remained constant last year, with men receiving about 30 percent more than women, said a study released yesterday by the American Association of University Professors.
Over all, salaries of full-time college and university faculty members rose 2.9 percent in 1995-96, keeping slightly ahead of the 2.5 percent rate of inflation, the study said. 
 The survey shows that pay differences have been consistent in the last 15 years. Part of the pay gap between men and women is attributed to the growing numbers of women in entry-level and junior faculty jobs. In the last six years, the association said, women have "made steady and very rapid growth" in academia, so that today women represent 32.3 percent of faculty members, up from 27.4 percent six years ago.
The gap is also attributable to a concentration of women in lower-paying departments, like education and English, the report says.
"Men disproportionately go into the hard sciences, engineering and business, which are relatively high paying," said Daniel S. Hamermesh, a professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin who wrote the report. "Women are largely drawn to fields like history, English, languages and education, which are traditionally low paying jobs."
When women reach full professor, the gap narrows to less than 10 percent, $66,740 to $58,990.
This is the third consecutive year in which the association's annual salary survey has found modest salary gains. Salaries for professors increased 3.4 percent in 1994-95, and 3 percent the year before.
The report studied 2,230 colleges and universities, accounting for more than 90 percent of all faculty members. It said average academic salaries were $57,760 at research institutions; $47,830 at four-year institutions with master's degree programs; $42,500 at four-year liberal arts schools, and $41,640 at two-year colleges.
The average salary for all professors, from lecturer to full professor, was $50,980, with the biggest gap between full professor, at $65,440, and associate professor, at $48,310.
About 81 percent of women are in jobs leading to tenure, compared with about 92 percent of men. Of those with tenure, about 72 percent are men and 48.3 percent are women.
Raises were lowest at public institutions, where salaries over the last 10 years rose 51.4 percent. At private, independent schools, they rose 57.8 percent, and at church-affiliated institutions, 64.4 percent.

HEADLINE: New Fee Plan for Woodhull Hospital Doctors

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation has signed a new type of agreement with the doctors who work at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, one that demands more cost-effective treatment and pays them only for the work they actually perform.
Officials of the city hospitals agency say the agreement opens a new era in labor relations with its doctors, who are provided by medical schools or, in the case of Woodhull, an independent medical corporation. They said they hope it will be a model for affiliation contracts at the corporation's other hospitals, encouraging greater productivity in the system and saving an estimated $50 million a year. 
 "We view this as a precedent-setting negotiation, which for the first time links reimbursement with productivity and performance," said Jane Zimmerman, a spokeswoman for the hospitals corporation.
In the past, the medical schools and corporations that provide doctors to the public hospitals have received tens of millions of dollars in lump-sum payments each year and their doctors, in turn, have received set salaries, regardless of how many patients they saw. Critics of the corporation have long complained that the doctors have been lazy and unhelpful, often turning up hours late at clinics to which they were assigned.
Under the new affiliation agreement, the Woodhull Medical Group will lay off more than 10 percent of its doctors, and the doctors who remain will be paid in proportion to how many patients they treat, with the corporation setting standards for productivity. The corporation will guarantee doctors part of their current salaries for the next two years, but after that, the medical group will be paid for each patient its doctors see and each service they perform.
Doctors who do more work will be paid more, giving the medical group great incentive to pressure its members to be more productive. The Hospitals Corporation, in turn, has pledged to improve support services at the hospitals, like the time it takes to get laboratory results.
The agreement leaves the doctors at Woodhull vulnerable to losing large chunks of their paychecks if the hospital fails to run more efficiently. But many physicians at Woodhull said they felt it was a gamble they had to take, given that more than 10 percent of the city's hospitals are expected to close in the next few years, leaving doctors unemployed. The managed-care companies that are making huge inroads in the region demand more efficient medical care.
"It's given us, as a hospital and as a group, the opportunity to survive," said Dr. Gabriel Koz, president of the Woodhull Medical Group. "With managed care coming down, we were receptive to the agreement, although it was also very frightening."
The new contract took six months to negotiate and was hammered out by representatives of the hospitals corporation, the Woodhull Medical Group and the Doctors' Council, the union that represents most of Woodhull's physicians.
Corporation officials are now negotiating new affiliation contracts at 6 of H.H.C.'s 10 other hospitals: Bellevue Hospital Center, Harlem Hospital Center, Lincoln Hospital, Metropolitan Hospital Center, North Central Bronx Hospital, and Jacobi Medical Center. The city wants to turn over to private hands three other hospitals: Elmhurst Hospital Center, Queens Hospital Center and Coney Island Hospital.
It is unclear if the agreement will serve as a model at other public hospitals, which are generally staffed by the city's powerful medical schools.
Last year, doctors from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine who work at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx refused such a contract, saying it would be impossible to meet the H.H.C.'s productivity standards in H.H.C. clinics, where exam rooms are in short supply and patient charts are hard to find. Einstein is ending its affiliation with Jacobi when its contract expires this summer.
But as they are squeezed by cuts in Medicare and the incursion of managed care, other medical schools may well decide they need the money they get from the affiliation contracts, even on the new terms.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
After 5 Years of False Starts, Japan's Economy Is Stirring

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 10

 BODY:
This winter has lasted five years in Japan, but there is finally talk of an economic spring.
The stock market is up, corporate profits are rising, and there is plenty of cash in the banks. Perhaps more important, the long economic chill has forced corporate Japan to re-examine itself and cut costs, and so now companies may be better poised than before to compete with American and European conglomerates around the globe. 
 "Most corporations seem to have pretty much restructured themselves and are able to yield profits," said Haruo Shimada, a professor of economics at Keio University. "They are ready for another attack."
Manufacturers are once again buying equipment, adding product lines and building new plants, and corporations such as Toyota, Hitachi and NEC are scrambling to meet demand. Companies are lifting dividends again, paying more overtime, raising salaries and even widening the narrow crack in the door to new recruits.
Department stores that were virtually empty for years are doing so much better that they are opening branches across the country. Yasuo Matsushita, the governor of the central bank, the Bank of Japan, even suggested recently that given the signs of recovery, interest rates could edge up. The discount rate here is now half a percent.
And though this recovery is not so much built on American-style layoffs, most of Japan's large corporations are beginning to realize that the promise of lifetime employment is one they can no longer afford.
"The recession was the trigger for a historic transformation of Japan," said Richard A. Werner, an economist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.
In the last quarter of 1995, Japan's economy grew at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, compared with the previous quarter. And after several years of near-zero growth, economists are forecasting growth rates of about 3 percent for 1996. Some are even putting Japan's growth rate above that of the United States and other nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
To be sure, growth this year is still paltry compared with the frenzied pace decades ago, when the economy expanded nearly 10 percent annually. Nobody seems to think Japan has any chance of reliving those glory days.
Moreover, Japan has had enough false starts in the last few years to make every citizen a skeptic, and many economists say they expect the economy to slow down again next year. Depressed property prices and more than $400 billion in sour loans still impose a costly drag on the economy.
Some experts say that Japan is going to need far more serious reorganizing -- deregulation by the Government, layoffs from companies and greater reliance on technology and innovation by absolutely everybody -- before it can stage a real, lasting comeback. And if Japan continues to gloss over such problems as its aging population, the growth of imports, its cumbersome distribution network and its weak service industry, economic troubles could choke the country as it enters the next century.
But for now, the psychology of recession seems to be waning, so some consumers dare to spend again -- and that in itself is helping to lift the economy. Last month, for instance, 460 Japanese left on a three-month round-the-world cruise, after doling out up to $140,000 for the package, and they beat out hundreds of other disappointed customers, who have to wait for the 1997 cruise.
Just as the cruise passengers will spend their yen at ports all over the world, so a rebound in the Japanese economy could be a significant boon to businesses in the United States and elsewhere. Japan has the world's second-largest economy, after the United States, and it is one of America's biggest markets -- for everything from airplanes to wheat to machinery.
As Japan's economy grows, so will the Japanese appetite for American goods, and this, in turn, could help narrow the trade deficit with Japan and help lift the American economy.
Once again, foreign companies are moving to or expanding in Japan, and the economy is beginning to loosen up at the edges to accommodate change and, therefore, more growth, some economists say.
While most of the initial economic jolt is coming from a Government spending spree and corporate investment, the revampings that many Japanese companies pursued during hard times may also be paying off at last. Japanese companies have cut costs, retooled plants and moved expensive factories overseas.
Now, analysts say, profits for Japan's industries are expected to be up at least 18 percent for the 1995 fiscal year, which ended March 31, and much higher for 1996. More important, Japan must deal with a new technological challenge that could provide years of growth: catch up to the West.
"The information industry in Japan fully knows it is behind," said Jesper Koll, an economist with J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd. "They recognize they are latecomers and need to catch up. And catching up to the leader is definitely one thing Japan is best at."
Japan is behind the United States in using technology, and everyone acknowledges that this is a handicap. But the situation also means that Japan can have a spurt of growth as it belatedly moves to expand the use of personal computers, electronic mail and the Internet.
Itsuji Araki, deputy general manager of executive personnel at NKK, one of Japan's largest steelmakers, used to share his job with two other managers. Every day, they would hold meetings to make decisions before writing up reports to propose to their senior executives.
Mr. Araki had to make a trip to his boss's office and get approval before he could take his written proposals all the way up the line to the president. Now, he can simultaneously send his reports to everyone, and he has taken over the job of three.
"Before, in order to give an explanation, I had to get prepared 100 percent," Mr. Araki said. "Now, I can give a rough idea first and, for the details, use E-mail. I save time waiting in the secretary's office for the bosses."
He added: "In the restroom when I meet my boss, I say, 'I put an E-mail in for you,' and he says, 'I saw that.' "
It is not clear how long this recovery may last, and many economists are forecasting slower growth for 1997. But among the signs of an incipient rebound are these:
 *The stock market, after tumbling in the early 1990's, has climbed to its highest level in more than four years, up about 50 percent from its nine-year low last July.
*Corporate profits are up sharply, with forecasts for this year pegged at 30 percent growth or more.
*Economic indicators, like growth in industrial production and construction orders, are up significantly, amid signs that the economy is being fueled by demand for goods at home, rather than demand for exports.
*Key surveys of business confidence have turned positive.
*A measure of stability can be seen in the stronger dollar, which makes Japanese goods cheaper for American buyers.
The path of the yen, which has greatly affected the fortunes of Japanese exporters, has seesawed over the last 14 months from 100 yen to the dollar, to 80 yen, and back to 107 yen, where it has settled and smoothed the way for Japanese exports.
The economic hardships, though, have been harsh on Japanese companies, and their hands have been pinned down in many ways by enormous rigidities in the economy and a culture that still makes it difficult for large corporations to dismiss employees. Yet while more change is still needed, Japanese companies have slimmed their ranks and trimmed their sails.
Take the case of Okuma Ltd., a prominent maker of sophisticated machine tools, which had 2,300 employees at the height of the economic troubles in the early 1990's.
In two years, the company's monthly order book fell to about $27 million, a quarter of peak levels, and Okuma knew it had to do something to survive. So in a move that set off debate across the nation and forced its president to resign, Okuma embarked on a ruthless revamping that resulted in the layoff of nearly a third of its work force, or 700 employees.
"Our future prospects looked very worrisome," said Masahiro Kitajima, a board member at Okuma.
Okuma started making its own parts, adding simpler, cheaper versions to its product line and broadening its variety of models to attract more sales. By reorganizing and cutting costs, it lowered its break-even point by 25 percent, reducing the level of sales it needs to cover costs and turn a profit.
The result is that after three consecutive years of losses, Okuma says it will report a profit this fiscal year of about $14 million.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Buoyant Dollar Hits Resistance And Can't Hold Higher Levels

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar climbed to its highest level in 14 months against the German mark yesterday, but retreated in late trading.
The dollar eked out a fresh 26-month high against the Japanese yen but also succumbed to selling pressure, traders said. 
 "The dollar couldn't hold those higher levels and it looks like the rally is over for now," said Jay Wertheimer, senior foreign exchange trader at Banco di Sicilia. "But the market seems to want to take the dollar higher."
A report showing that the number of unemployed Germans rose by 26,000 in March helped cement growing expectations for lower official German interest rates and fueled early dollar buying.
By contrast, the United States economy seems relatively strong, with steady interest rates that tend to enhance the appeal of dollar-based assets.
"Right now the dollar has a firm basis on the idea the U.S. economy is performing better than expected," said Chris Widness, international economist at Chase Securities.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4973 marks, down from 1.4982 marks on Tuesday. The dollar was also quoted at 108.40 yen, up from 108.30 yen.
A sharp drop in the British pound also helped propel the dollar as high as 1.5068 marks during the session, the highest rate since the dollar touched 1.51 marks on Feb. 16, 1995.
The pound slumped badly amid fears that the ruling Conservative Party would weaken further after a special election today. The Conservatives are expected to lose an election to fill an empty parliamentary seat representing Staffordshire in central England. A loss would cut the Conservatives' majority in the House of Commons to one.
"We're seeing a lot of pressure on the pound," said Alex Scarsini, director of foreign exchange at Barclays Group. "A lot of people are getting out of the pound and into the dollar."
In New York, the British pound was trading at $1.5125, down from $1.5205.
But the dollar was unable to continue rallying. Some traders cited the dollar's failure to break past 1.2250 Swiss francs, a key resistance point, as a reason for some selling.
The dollar remains generally buoyant, but faces some tough resistance at current levels, traders said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
For Giuliani, Baseball May Be a Costly Issue

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The Mayor who likes to say "no" has whispered a tentative but unmistakable "yes" to the idea of moving Yankee Stadium to the West Side of Manhattan. And in doing so, Rudolph W. Giuliani has allowed his political opponents to feast on what may be one of the defining issues of the 1997 mayoral campaign.
With the gusto that only a true New York development brawl can provide, two of the Republican Mayor's most likely challengers have quickly and vocally moved to oppose the stadium proposal, thereby foreshadowing many of the themes likely to dominate next year's mayoral race. In a series of recent public appearances, Ruth W. Messinger and Fernando Ferrer, the Borough Presidents of Manhattan and the Bronx, have appeared positively gleeful at the opportunity to portray Mr. Giuliani as a free spender on luxury skyboxes at a time of drastic cutbacks to schools, subways, welfare and city services. 
 "It's pretty clear that this is a precursor to next year's race," said Henry A. Sheinkopf, a political consultant working for Mr. Ferrer. "It raises serious questions about what the city's priorities are, where it's important for New York City to spend its money. Potentially, it does have a lot of political capital."
The Mayor, for his part, said he would "love to have that debate" with his opponents, accusing them of the same anti-business mentality he said forced four sports franchises from the city, beginning with the Dodgers in 1957. In an interview, he specifically accused Mr. Ferrer -- who has often been critical of George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the principal owner of the Yankees -- of working first to drive the team out the Bronx and eventually out of New York City.
"I think it's a terrible issue for them," Mr. Giuliani said. "It's their philosophy that's run this city into the ground, this virulently anti-business attitude." At a news conference yesterday, he further intensified his case, saying his opponents' antipathy to business is the same philosophy that cost the city hundreds of thousands of jobs under Democratic mayors.
That argument will undoubtedly resonate with business officials, property owners on the West Side and construction unions. But in this case, the business to be saved is the New York Yankees, a team that no longer commands the city's widespread devotion.
The anger that even Yankee fans express for Mr. Steinbrenner plays directly into the hands of the challengers, producing what many political observers see as a win-win situation for them. They can oppose a new stadium as a taxpayer giveaway to a widely disliked wealthy businessman, using it to highlight the many areas in which the Mayor has cut back on spending. If Mr. Steinbrenner makes good on his threats and leaves town, he is the one most likely to be blamed by a bitter populace.
"It used to be that no politician could afford to be perceived as someone who lost the Yankees, but all that has changed over the last generation," said Jay Severin, a Republican political consultant. "The romanticism about sports franchises is gone, and the level of skepticism is now much greater than it was. If they portray this as an expensive frivolity, a priority over schools, it's a tough argument for the Mayor to win."
The election, of course, is more than a year and half away, and there has never been any shortage of criticism from Democrats of Mr. Giuliani's budget cuts. But in many ways, a new stadium provides precisely the contrast that the critics have been seeking when hammering away at those cuts, even if the stadium requires the minimal taxpayer investment predicted by the Mayor.
It is bad enough when schools are leaking and overcrowded, and the city has yet to come up with the more than $1 billion needed for repairs. But perpetual inability to fix the schools makes a much better sound bite when juxtaposed with the city's readiness to build a $1 billion new stadium.
As Mr. Ferrer said last week on the steps of City Hall, "At a time when you have schools that are crumbling, to spend $1 billion on baseball is nothing short of obscene."
Councilman Sal F. Albanese, the only declared candidate in the race so far, was out of town this week, but an aide said he, too, wants the team to remain in the Bronx.
The administration has yet to provide any figures on how the stadium would be financed, although the Mayor has confidently predicted that taxpayer subsidies could be kept to a minimum because of the increased attendance at a Manhattan ball park. The proposed stadium's critics have questioned that assumption, predicting that millions of public dollars will be required.
But even if they are wrong, the likely increase in ticket prices and parking fees also works as a populist argument. Ms. Messinger has already suggested that the move toward skyboxes and ticket surcharges would make it far more difficult for the average fan to attend a game.
At one level, both Mr. Ferrer and Ms. Messinger clearly have local constituencies to serve in opposing the move. Mr. Ferrer would like to keep the team and its economic benefits in his home borough, and Ms. Messinger would like to keep what she has called a potential traffic nightmare out of hers.
But opposing the proposal works for both undeclared candidates at deeper levels as well. For Ms. Messinger, in particular, turning the West Side stadium into the House That Ruth Blocked allows her to demonstrate that her concerns extend beyond Manhattan, the borough with which she is so completely identified. It is the Bronx, she said, that would be devastated if the Yankees move.
"This issue raises the question of whether or not the other four boroughs get the attention to their economic and neighborhood development that they deserve," she said. "If we fail to provide huge chunks of this city with those resources, we will become a city that fewer and fewer people choose to stay in."

HEADLINE: Utility Proposes Choice of Power Supplier

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: PEARL RIVER, N.Y., April 10

 BODY:
The public utility here wants to let its customers pick their own electric power supplier, just as many already do with their long-distance telephone service.
It is proposing an experiment that would involve 1,500 residents and many of the area's factories and shopping malls. The proposal, announced today, would be one of the first such experiments in the nation to introduce competition into an industry that has been dominated by territorial monopolies for almost a century. 
 The proposal, by Orange and Rockland Utilities Inc., has been endorsed by the staff ot the state's Public Service Commission, but it still must be acted on by the full five-member commission next month.
If it is approved, customers who volunteer to take part would select another utility or private power company to provide their electricity in the same way that NYNEX customers can choose among Sprint, MCI, AT&T or others for long-distance service. The electricity, though, would be transmitted over Orange and Rockland's wires and bills would continue to be paid to Orange and Rockland.
The utility, which supplies electricity to 263,200 customers in Orange and Rockland Counties as well as small enclaves in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, would lose some of its $1 billion in annual revenue. But energy analysts say that it decided to test the waters because of the inevitability of competition in the heavily regulated electric industry.
"It's more or less a forgone conclusion that the United States is heading toward deregulation of electric utilities, and the sooner anyone knows what the pitfalls are going to be the better," said Dan Scotto, a utility analyst for Bear Stearns & Company. "You'll probably see other utilities following suit."
One big goal of the three-year experiment is to see what kind of savings the plan will produce for consumers. Orange and Rockland officials pointed out that the generation of power makes up only 25 percent of the cost of electricity. Pressed to be more specific about savings, the utility's chief executive, D. Louis Peoples, said 1.5 to 2 percent would not be "out of whack."
Under the experiment, industrial customers could voluntarily designate their suppliers starting in June and residential and commercial customers could so in January. Officials of Orange and Rockland said they expected a number of suppliers and electricity brokers to solicit residential customers by telephone or advertising in local newspapers.
The competitors in this free-for-all could include other utilities that are trying to sell excess electrical power or some of the several hundred private suppliers like the United States Generating Company of Bethesda, Md., company officials said. Utilities neighboring those in New York State usually produce power at cheaper prices, and many large factories would like to be able to buy their power.
Similar limited experiments have been approved in Wisconsin and Illinois, and others are awaiting approval in New Hampshire, Michigan, California and Massachusetts. But none is yet under way.
Among residents of Rockland today, news of the plan was met with enthusiasm, but there was also skepticism, with some people expressing concern that having to choose a supplier would complicate already complicated lives.
"It's bad enough now with the phone bill, it's so confusing," said Maria Lauricella of Orangetown. "I don't think it's a good idea at all."
But Jerry Dickow, superintendent of the Rockland County Cemetery, was more receptive to the possibility that he could save some money. "At least this sounds like you're giving people a choice," he said. "Anything that generates competition has got to benefit the public."
This crack in one of the last monopolies in the American economy began with a 1992 Federal law that forced utilities to transmit power generated by independent producers and destined for distant customers.
Large industrial users began putting pressure on utilities to cut rates or let them choose their own power suppliers, sometimes threatening to leave counties or cities with high costs. In Orange and Rockland, large industrial companies have banded together into an Industrial Energy Users Association that has lobbied for lower rates with the regulatory agency. That association was part of the negotiations for a 2.3 percent reduction in Orange and Rockland rates this week that included the experiment, called Powerpick, as part of the agreement.
With the historic protection of its market crumbling, the electric industry has been drafting proposals to wade into the murky pool of competition. In New York, the one proposal that all seven of the state's utilities have agreed to would also involve competition but only at the wholesale level. Generating companies would be allowed to bid to supply power to existing utilities, but the utilities would continue to set prices for their customers.
Orange and Rockland took competition one important step further -- to the retail level. It was able to do so more readily than, say, Consolidated Edison because it already buys 40 percent of its power and can let its customers deal directly with those suppliers or others.
"We as a company believe competition is inevitable and we want to start playing in this market early," said Terry Dittrich, manager of the project for the utility.
The experiment is intended to answer a raft of questions. Would there indeed be any savings to consumers? How would costs be apportioned in such a system? Who would repay the utilities for their large investments in generating plants, equipment and overpriced power contracts? Would the system retain its reliability? If the answers after three years are positive, utility officials said, more customers would be permitted to choose their suppliers.
Mr. Scotto said the experience of other deregulated industries like telephones and airlines did not offer much hope for savings. "The empirical evidence suggests that over time competition does not necessarily produce lower rates for customers," he said.
Another concern is whether in a competitive atmosphere the interests of the smallest customers -- the poor and aged, for example -- would be protected. Currently, for example, utilities are forbidden during the winter months to shut off power to customers who cannot pay their bills.
"What happens to social and environmental policies that have been incorporated into rate-making," said Bob Johnson, executive director of the Electric Consumers Alliance, which represents low-income, elderly and minority consumer groups on utility issues.
Mr. Peoples denied that the Powerpick experiment was aimed at burnishing the company's image after a scandal in 1993 and 1994 in which top executives either pleaded guilty or were forced to resign for spending the utility's money on personal uses and illegal political donations. "Those darker days are history," he said.
Rather, the main thrust of the plan is to give consumers the feeling that they are not locked into a single power supplier. "How many times have you as a consumer said to yourself, 'Gee, I wish I had a choice in this thing,' " he said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Smaller Pay Gap For Male and Female Doctors

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 10

 BODY:
The pay gap between male and female physicians is closing, a study has found.
In the study, being published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Laurence C. Baker of Stanford University found that when differences of medical specialty, number of hours worked and practice setting are taken into account, men and women who are doctors now earn almost the same amounts. 
 "The story I'm telling supports the hypothesis that trends in medicine towards pay equality are helping, at least among young physicians," said Dr. Baker, 27, an assistant professor in economics.
Dr. Baker analyzed statistics from the 1987 and 1991 Surveys of Young Physicians, a nationwide survey of doctors under 45 years of age with two to nine years of experience. "I wanted to look at the younger physicians because they are the leading edge of change," he said. "That's where the action is."
As recently as 1987, Dr. Baker found, young men in medicine earned 7 percent more per hour than women, even after various factors like differences in specialties were taken into account. That gap was almost completely absent in the newer data.
In 1990, male physicians made $45,500 a year more than their female counterparts in mean earnings, but after adjusting for the fact that the men work an average of 11 more hours a week than the women, the $7 an hour difference that was left was almost completely because of medical specialty.
Pay discrimination seems to have lessened if male and female doctors do the same jobs, but often they still do not. Although 40 percent of first-year medical students are now women, less than 20 percent of surgical residents are women, according to the American Medical Association.
Why female physicians more often choose lower-paying specialties, like general practice and pediatrics, is a matter of debate. "This is the $64,000 question," Dr. Baker said. "It's like looking at a cross section of the population and asking why does one person choose to be a teacher and another person chooses to be a doctor. It's a tremendously personal decision."
In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. Ruth L. Kirschstein of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., also pointed to the disparity among female and male doctors in positions of power in academic and professional societies.
"As the United States enters the 21st century," she said, "it is imperative that women physicians, who appear to have achieved equity in earnings also achieve greater prominence in academic and organized medicine. Only then will the news be entirely good."
In 1994 there were only four female deans of medical schools, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. That same year only 24 percent of full-time medical school faculty members were women.
The good news also does not apply to all doctors. Some specialties stillshowed wage gaps. Young men in internal-medicine subspecialties and emergency medicine earned 26 percent more than women, although men in general and family practices earned 13 percent less than women. The study also showed that men with 10 or more years of experience still earn 17 percent more per hour than women.

HEADLINE: China Awards Huge Jet Order To Europeans

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 10

 BODY:
China's Prime Minister, Li Peng, began a visit to France today by placing an order for an estimated $1.5 billion worth of European-built passenger planes, sending a signal to the Clinton Administration that Beijing can turn to European partners if the United States becomes too intractable on human rights and trade.
The Chinese leader, making his first visit to France since presiding over the 1989 military crackdown on the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square, met with Prime Minister Alain Juppe tonight and signed a contract for 10 short-haul A320 passenger planes for China Southern Airlines from the Airbus Industrie consortium. 
 France's Foreign Minister, Herve de Charette, said the deal also obligated China to buy another 20 of the narrow-bodied A320's, but it was not clear whether this constituted a firm order or an option. Big airplane deals are often announced and reanounced, and today the Chinese confirmed an order originally made known two years ago for three larger long-haul A340 jumbo jets, also from Airbus Industrie. Details were not fully disclosed tonight.
These and earlier inroads by Airbus Industrie, a French-German-British-Spanish consortium, make it the Boeing Company's biggest competitor in China, long an almost captive market for American plane makers.
Today's Airbus order came a month after China's Trade Minister, Wu Yi, postponed a visit to the United States, where plane manufacturers had hoped for up to $4 billion in new orders.
The commercial aircraft business is one that the United States has long dominated; it supports both high-paying manufacturing jobs and advanced technology development. As such, it not only has considerable economic importance, but often assumes a high degree of political significance, as it has in the relationship between the United States and China.
Asia is the fastest-growing market for passenger aircraft, and Boeing and the other American plane manufacturer, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, have been coming under intensifying competition from Airbus.
The Chinese Government has taken advantage of the competition and has made no secret of its strategy of using aircraft orders as a carrot and a stick in dealing with the Clinton Administration. Mrs. Wu, the Trade Minister, put off her trip to the United States, and the announcement of orders, many of which had been expected to go to Boeing, after the Administration refused her a meeting with President Clinton and refused to delay its consideration of sanctions against China for allowing factories to produce pirated American video cassettes and compact disks.
One Administration official said tonight in Washington that the Airbus decision would not cause the United States to change its trade policy toward China, or drop its consideration of sanctions.
"It appears from reports that much of this involves agreements previously reached," the official said of today's order. The official added that "it would be improper to draw any conclusions one way or another" about the deal's effects on the overall relationship between China and the United States.
Cindy Smith, a Boeing spokeswoman, said: "We're disappointed in China's decision to purchase Airbus aircraft. But more importantly, the order underscores the need for the United States to move beyond the annual debate of most-favored-nation status for China and to create a long-term stable trading relationship. Boeing supports the Clinton Administration in its efforts to normalize trade between the United States and China. Establishing normal trade with China will lead to job creation and economic gain."
Ron Woodard, president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, said the Airbus order was "precipitated not because of the strength of our competition or the quality of their product," Reuters reported. "Rather, it is precipitated by what I believe are ill-founded political considerations," he added.
But Mr. Li did not escape pressure on human rights in Paris.
French newspapers greeted his arrival with satirical cartoons, and protesters denounced the visit as a sign of European willingness to sacrifice principle for profit. A small rally near the Eiffel Tower demanded that China release political prisoners and end what demonstrators called "the oppression of Tibet."
For security reasons, the French police kept a tight lid on the Chinese delegation's movements. The Chinese Prime Minister originally intended to go on to the Netherlands and Luxembourg this weekend, but canceled those visits, saying he was short of time. A visit he made to Germany two years ago was marked by many protests.
Mr. Li's visit to France also produced a three-year wheat deal, a $460 million French-financed expansion of a car factory in Wuhan that produces Citroen cars for the Chinese market and a $50 million gas-liquefaction plant for Shanghai. An agreement was also reached giving French ships unrestricted access to Chinese ports.
But the results amounted to far less than the $10 billion or so in trade deals that the French had hoped for after agreeing two years ago to stop selling arms to Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province.
Taiwan bought 60 Mirage jet fighters worth about $2.6 billion from France in 1992, on top of a $4.8 billion purchase of 16 naval frigates the previous year, and Beijing responded by banning Chinese orders from France.
But now a new, conservative administration under President Jacques Chirac is eager to establish France as a potential supplier of modern technology to China, and one less squeamish than the United States about doing business with countries that do not live up to Western standards on human rights.
The French deny a double standard, but are glad to have the business.
"Will we sacrifice human rights for trade?" asked Foreign Minister de Charette before Mr. Li's visit began. "That's out of the question." But Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, president of a French-Chinese industrial trade group, said he did not plan to raise the question of human rights during the visit at all. "I'm a businessman," he said.
Still, French officials said the signing of the plane deal tonight was delayed for two hours by a disagreement over Mr. Juppe's plan to bring up human rights during his dinner speech. In the end, Mr. Juppe did not touch on the subject, The Associated Press reported, but the two sides refused to exchange toasts.
For some French intellectuals, however, Mr. Li's presence spoke for itself.
"Mr. Li recovers his lost honor today," an essay in Tuesday's issue of Le Monde said. "But do those who govern us realize they are sacrificing theirs, and ours as well?"
Le Monde said the essay was written by "several senior officials who have filled posts in Asia," but published under a pseudonym.
About 50 supporters of Amnesty International stretched a white banner across the Champs-Elysees reading: "Li Peng ignores human rights. We don't." French policemen quickly removed it, and barred demonstrators from approaching the Chinese Embassy on Avenue Georges V.
With unemployment in France at 11.8 percent, and in Germany at 10.8 percent, both countries have been outdoing each other in soliciting job-generating trade orders from Asia's largest market. It is especially important for the aircraft industry, which President Chirac regards as crucial for maintaining European technological competitiveness with the United States in world trade. Mr. Chirac planned to have lunch with Mr. Li on Thursday.
Jacques Rummelhardt, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said, "France, as the world's fourth-largest exporter, doesn't have the position in China that it should have."
On Saturday Mr. Li is to visit the plant near Toulouse where the Airbus planes are made. Airbus Industrie received more orders for new planes than Boeing did in 1994, but last year secured only 106 orders, worth $7 billion, compared with Boeing's 346 orders, worth $31 billion.
French Foreign Ministry officials said negotiations were continuing on a possible purchase of 28 electric locomotives from the Alsthom group, an aluminum plant and other projects before Mr. Li returns to China on Saturday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Higher Gasoline Demand, and Prices

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The demand for gasoline, already soaring, is expected to set records this summer, sending prices higher, a Government agency predicted yesterday.
Prices rose in the last month on strong demand and unusually tight supplies; because of the long run of cold weather, refiners kept producing heating oil and kerosene rather than gasoline. 
 Some of the demand for gasoline reflects greater consumption from faster driving, as speed limits have been raised to 65 miles an hour on major highways in most states. Beyond that, customers are continuing to buy sport utility vehicles, which are less fuel-efficient, often in preference to cars and station wagons.
The Energy Information Administration, a unit of the United States Department of Energy, predicted yesterday that the demand for gasoline would increase 2.1 percent, to more than 8 million barrels a day, this summer. In the agency's terminology, the peak driving season of summer is considered half a year, the second and third quarters.
"U.S. gasoline demand has never averaged above 8 million barrels per day in a calendar quarter, so this summer's demand may be a watershed," the agency said.
And it added, "This year's demand increase is not a transitory phenomenon but is a reflection of two long-term factors: the relentless impact on travel demand of increased population and income, and the end of the era of perennial increases in average highway fuel efficiency."
This view underlines a debate under way in the industry: whether the increased use of sport utility vehicles has fundamentally changed demand, so that old yardsticks no longer apply.
The agency predicted that prices at the pump could average as high as $1.31 a gallon this summer if supplies continued to be tight and prices of crude oil remained high. Early this month, industry experts said, the price of regular fuel averaged $1.16 a gallon, and a year before that, $1.07.
At $1.31, retail prices would be the highest since the Persian Gulf war period early in 1991.
But if crude oil prices declined from current levels, as many analysts expect, the prices at the pump would increase less, to $1.23 on average during the summer, the agency said.
Though there is a surging demand and a greater reliance on imported gasoline, some energy experts doubt there will be a shortage, saying that refiners will produce more to add to supplies.
"There's not going to be a shortage," said John H. Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry consulting group. "There could be some price spikes."
Mr. Lichtblau said the current surge in gasoline prices was caused by higher crude oil prices and very low gasoline inventories.
Higher prices, though, have done little to discourage driving, with many motorists paying little attention to price and not bothering to comparison-shop. In some areas, it has become common for gas stations near each other to have as much as a 10-cent difference in price. Gasoline price wars are becoming rare.
Even with the higher prices expected this summer, gasoline, when adjusted for inflation and omitting taxes, costs less than in the 1960's.
Mike Morrissey, a spokesman of the American Automobile Association, said that the price increases expected this summer were "not enough to make you change your travel plans."
"It's not a major financial burden to keep the tank full," he said.
Mr. Morrissey added that an auto club study recently sought to determine how more it cost to drive a sport utility vehicle in terms of gasoline and oil. It found that a new Ford Taurus GL cost 5.9 cents a mile to drive, while a new Chevrolet Blazer, a sport utility vehicle, cost 6.8 cents a mile.
That kind of difference, he said, was not great enough to make people pause in buying sport utility vehicles -- a category that now makes up about 40 percent of new vehicle sales.
With that popularity, fuel economy has, after years of improvement, leveled off -- the memories of the gasoline lines of 1970's oil embargoes having faded.
Even though some experts worry that there could be another oil-supply crisis as a result of political instability in Saudi Arabia, they have remained voices in the wilderness as consumption has continued to grow.
The Energy Information Administration predicted that imports of crude oil could reach record levels this year of 50 percent.
At the wholesale level, gasoline for May delivery is now selling near 73 cents a gallon, the highest since May 1991.

HEADLINE: Florida Farm a Labor Battleground

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: QUINCY, Fla., April 10

 BODY:
Daniel Martinez figured he would join the lunchtime demonstration for higher wages and better working conditions, and be back on the job within the hour. Instead, his employer dismissed him and had him arrested for trespassing.
The 32-year-old Mr. Martinez was among 84 mushroom pickers discharged because of that demonstration, held last month at Quincy Farms, a mushroom grower here about 30 miles northwest of Tallahassee that the United Farm Workers union has been trying to persuade to bargain for a union contract. As part of the U.F.W.'s efforts to win recognition, it has called a boycott of the company's Prime-label mushrooms, which are sold throughout the Southeast. 
 The U.F.W.'s drive here coincides with a new priority by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations to increase union membership among low-paid workers, particularly in the South. Quincy Farms, with 615 workers, is the largest private employer in one of Florida's poorest counties, Gadsden.
The pickers here, almost all of them immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador, say that although they want better pay and benefits -- their average weekly wage, they say, ranges from $180 to $270 -- of greater concern are job safety and security, and what one after another describe as the "disrespect" encountered daily.
"I want them to pay attention to us," said Mr. Martinez, a Quincy Farms employee for the last four years who supports a wife and two young sons and who, like the other dismissed pickers, is looking to get his job back once union representation is won. "Right now we don't get any respect from the company. They scream at you. If you protest, they take you to the office" like a child.
Many workers complain that any disagreement with a supervisor invariably leads to threats of dismissal. Harvesters must climb five feet or higher to reach mushrooms that are grown indoors in trays stacked one above another, and falls, they say, are common. But those who require medical attention must sign papers accepting responsibility for the accident before treatment is offered, the workers say, and often the company doctor does not take the injury seriously and sends the worker back to the job.
When one group of workers asked for a raise last October, union organizers here say, a supervisor used rough language to turn them down. Other workers then staged a five-hour job halt in protest, and that led to higher pay for packers, irrigators and all other workers except the pickers, who instead settled for modifications in their work to help prevent accidents.
Company officials did not return telephone calls seeking interviews, but in advertisements and letters published by local newspapers they contend that they have been responsive to employee concerns by holding regular meetings and providing protective gear like back-support belts. They say the company offers a 401(k) retirement plan, major medical coverage and competitive wages.
The president of Quincy Farms, Rick Lazzarini, does not describe the shutting out of the workers who attended the lunchtime demonstration on March 14 as a dismissal. He says that he instead considers them to be on strike, although he has not explained his rationale, and that the two dozen workers who were arrested at the demonstration had ignored repeated warnings to move the protest off company property.
Quincy Farms officials also say the labor dispute is the work of "a few outside agitators." But some here attribute it to the growing expectations of the workers, Hispanic immigrants who have been in the United States long enough to become permanent residents, to purchase not only trailer homes but also satellite dishes that enable them to receive Spanish-language television, and to be increasingly vocal about their treatment.
"Their legal status has given them self-confidence," said the Rev. Richard Castillo, pastor of St. Thomas the Apostle Church, which is trying to mediate the dispute. "A lot of them know enough English to know what should be happening, and what shouldn't be happening."
The U.F.W., which has nine organizers here from Texas, California and New York and has set up headquarters at a Roman Catholic center in the nearby town of Greensboro, says that more than half of Quincy Farms's employees have signed authorization cards supporting representation by the union. Many cars in town now carry bumper stickers reading "Union, si." "
Beyond recognition, the union wants Quincy Farms to drop trespassing charges against those arrested and to reinstate those dismissed. But already the company has replaced half of the discharged workers.
The U.F.W. faces other hurdles as well. For one thing, farm workers are exempt from provisions of the National Labor Relations Act that enable other workers to petition for Government-supervised elections that determine whether their workplaces will be unionized. For another, Florida is a right-to-work state, giving employees of unionized companies the option to stay out of the union. None of the estimated 300,000 seasonal farm workers in the state are currently covered by a union contract.
"I suspect that if the firm hunkers down and is adamant in not allowing them to organize or signing a union contract, that's exactly what would happen, and it would survive," said Prof. Barry Hirsh of Florida State University, who specializes in labor economics.
As the weeks go by without word from the company, some of the discharged pickers have found temporary jobs in local nurseries, while others search for work in either construction or the area's tomato fields. They also take turns picketing outside Quincy Farms but are limited under the terms of a court injunction to 16 pickets at a time, at least 50 yards away from the entrance.
The strategy now is to build support for the boycott, a tool that has proved successful for the U.F.W. in the past. But so far local groceries are still carrying Prime mushrooms in their produce sections, and many of the workers, especially those supporting families, have no idea whether they will be able to meet next month's bills.

HEADLINE: Healing Quebec

 BODY:
Quebec voted last October by the thinnest of margins to remain a part of Canada. But the emotional campaign and close result left Canada's second-most-populous province bitterly polarized. Six months later a new Quebec Premier, Lucien Bouchard, is trying to heal the divisions. Though a committed separatist, Mr. Bouchard has made reconciliation and recovery his primary concerns. This shift is a welcome development, for Quebec, for Canada and for the United States.
Quebec separatists have long contended that their nationalism was not limited to the French-descended majority. But large numbers of English-Canadians, immigrants and Cree Indians feared they would be unwelcome in an independent Quebec; 83 percent of Quebecers grew up speaking French, 10 percent speaking English and 7 percent speaking other languages. 
 In the October referendum, 60 percent of the French-speakers voted for separation, while some 95 percent of the non-French-speakers voted against. These figures provoked an angry and offensive Election Night outburst from Jacques Parizeau, then Quebec's Premier, who blamed "money and the ethnic vote" for the defeat of his separatist cause. Mr. Parizeau was forced to resign.
He was succeeded by Mr. Bouchard, an engaging and effective politician who had been a Conservative cabinet minister in the 1980's. Converted to separatism, Mr. Bouchard waged a passionate but civil campaign for the "yes" side in the referendum and was chiefly responsible for the separatists' near-success. That earned him considerable credit in the French-speaking community, and he has begun to put it to good use.
Without sacrificing the ultimate aim of separatism, Mr. Bouchard has announced that no new referendum will be held before the next provincial election, which could be more than three years off. Yet another vote on separation so soon after the last would only be destructive. Mr. Bouchard sensibly declares that regenerating Quebec's ailing economy must come before any new status vote.
Mr. Bouchard has also mixed his calls for a separate Quebec with pleas for continued formal association with Canada, leaving some maneuvering room for a future constitutional accord. Quebec has legitimate constitutional grievances, and Canada's Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, has promised to address them in the near future.
Most important , Mr. Bouchard has grasped the need to reassure and rebuild trust among non-French-speaking Quebecers.
Healing is just what Quebec needs. Over the years, a revitalized French-speaking community has done much to end its second-class economic status within the province. French-speaking business owners and executives are now far more plentiful and powerful than before. Yet the skills and energies of English-Canadians and immigrants also make an important contribution to the provincial economy. Unless the alienation and concerns of these minority groups are addressed, they could move elsewhere, damaging business confidence and diminishing Quebec's cultural vibrancy.
Quebec needs a breather, and Mr. Bouchard seems determined to provide one. Quebec and Canada will be the better for it, and America will benefit by facing a less turbulent Canadian province across the border.

MUSICLAND POSTPONES PUBLIC OFFERING FOR UNIT

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Musicland Stores Corporation postponed the planned initial public offering of its Suncoast Motion Picture Company unit yesterday and said it would take a $35 million pretax restructuring charge in the first quarter. Musicland, the nation's largest seller of prerecorded music and videos, also said its banks had agreed to provide more financial flexibility in return for an increase of half a percentage point in the interest rate on its debt. The company said it had decided to put off selling a 30 percent stake in Suncoast because it believed that the unit was worth more than the market wanted to pay. Musicland, which is based in Minneapolis, had said in January that it hoped to sell 3 million of Suncoast's 10 million shares to the public at about $15 a share.

HEADLINE: TV WEEKEND;
On the Chicano Awakening

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
"Chicano!," a four-hour tribute to the Mexican-American civil rights movement, begins in the 1960's with the campaign for the return of lands in New Mexico that leaders like Reies Lopez Tijerina claimed had been guaranteed to Chicanos after the Mexican-American War. His Alianza movement, participants recall, fostered an ethnic solidarity that soon broadened into demands for economic justice and political power.
Allied to other minorities and to protesters against the Vietnam War, the Mexican-American Crusade for Justice, led by Rodolfo (Corky) Gonzales, sparked demonstrations for antipoverty causes and community control as it strove to build an independent political movement in the Southwest. 
 The producers' sympathy for the efforts of a beaten-down people to assert themselves is, unfortunately, not matched by the production, which is more dutiful than inspired, more celebratory than inquiring. Still, it does draw attention to a significant piece of the history of the 1960's.
At its most vivid, the opening hour brings back high or low moments, like Tijerina's June 1967 attack on a New Mexico courthouse, which earned him a jail sentence, and the big 1970 anti-Vietnam War rally in Los Angeles that erupted into violence. The police called it a Chicano riot; the pictures used here suggest that it was a police riot.
The second hour, "The Struggle in the Fields," covers the best known, hardest fought and most successful of Chicano movements, the migrant-worker campaign led by Cesar Chavez. The exposure of the conditions under which crop pickers labored and Chavez's spirit of nonviolence stirred sympathy across America. The combination of a prolonged strike, a consumer grape boycott and the efforts of politicians like Robert F. Kennedy brought the farm workers' union its first labor contracts and new laws that improved conditions for the long-exploited workers.
In something of an anticlimax, next week's two hours are given to a 1968 conflict over the schools in East Los Angeles and the creation in 1970 of La Raza Unida as a third political party.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Outlook for Rise In U.S. Rates and Fall in Bonn's

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday, bolstered by expectations that United States interest rates would remain steady, while German rates would fall.
With the United States economy showing signs of strength, currency traders and analysts expect the Federal Reserve will keep short-term interest rates steady and may even raise rates later this year. At the same time, the Bundesbank is expected to cut German rates later this quarter to spur Germany's stagnant economy. 
 Higher interest rates bolster a currency by making its assets more attractive.
"The dollar's extremely strong against the Europeans," said Malcolm Gilroy, a portfolio manager at Laketon Investment Management in Toronto. "The U.S. economy is quite clearly strengthening. The exact opposite is true in Europe."
For the second consecutive day, the dollar touched a 26-month high against the Japanese yen, rising as high as 108.90 yen, its highest level since Feb. 9, 1994, when it reached 109 yen. The dollar also neared a 14-month high against the German mark, rising as high as 1.5047 marks.
"Everyone is jumping on the higher-dollar bandwagon," said Richard Vullo, manager of currency sales at Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank.
But in trading in New York, the dollar gave up some of its gains. The dollar settled at 108.41 yen, up from 108.40 on Wednesday. The dollar was also quoted at 1.5020 marks, up from 1.4973. The British pound fell to $1.5115 from $1.5125.
The Bank of France lowered an important interest rate yesterday, and some analysts expect the Bundesbank to follow suit in the coming months. Comments by several Bundesbank officials fed speculation of a rate cut.
In an interview yesterday with The Financial Times, the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, pledged to "assess carefully" the potential for cuts.
In addition, the Bundesbank's chief economist, Otmar Issing, dismissed concerns about a recent surge in money-supply growth. Mr. Issing said Germany ran no risk of a stronger inflation rate.
The yen continued to suffer yesterday from Japanese investors sending money overseas to escape Japan's low interest rates, traders said. Japanese 10-year Government bonds yield 3.31 percent, compared with 6.66 percent for United States Treasury 10-year bonds.

HEADLINE: Clinton Adviser Rules Out Taking Commerce Post

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
Thomas F. McLarty 3d, a top White House adviser, has withdrawn as a possible replacement for Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, leaving a wide-open field.
Clinton Administration officials said today that Mr. Clinton was in a hurry to replace Mr. Brown, who died along with 34 others on April 3 in a plane crash in Croatia. They said the President could settle on a choice as early as this week. 
 "He will find a replacement for Secretary Brown and do so rather swiftly," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary.
Mr. McCurry also suggested that Mr. McLarty had told the President that he wanted to remain as White House counselor, an ambiguous but influential position he took in 1994 after being bumped as White House chief of staff.
An official close to Mr. McLarty, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Mr. McLarty, a former business executive in Arkansas, had passed on the chance to replace Mr. Brown because he wanted to be involved in Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign.
Other aides said Mr. McLarty also feared a bruising battle with Republicans, although the official close to Mr. McLarty denied that.
Senator Larry Pressler, the South Dakota Republican who heads the Commerce Committee, said today that he had a high opinion of Mr. McLarty and did not expect a fight over any potential Clinton nominee.
Mr. Pressler also praised Stuart E. Eizenstat, the chief domestic policy adviser under President Jimmy Carter, who is well liked by Mr. Clinton, but an Administration official said it did not appear that Mr. Eizenstat would get the job.
Mr. Clinton is apparently interested in someone else, a person whom the official would not identify.
With the White House keeping quiet about filling the post, Congressional and economic-community officials circulated names of prospects, including John Young, former head of Hewlett-Packard; Mary Goode, the Acting Commerce Secretary; George Fisher, chief executive of Eastman Kodak, who spoke at Mr. Brown's funeral, and John Scully of Apple Computer Inc.
Officials say Mr. Clinton is interested in finding an official from a high-tech industry.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson of the National Economic Council and Phil Lader, the director of the Small Business Administration, have been mentioned in news reports as prospects, but aides said Mr. Clinton was not considering them.
Another question facing the President is whether Republicans will block his nominee as part of their effort to eliminate the Commerce Department. The plane crash that ended Mr. Brown's life also ended his campaign to save the department. Congressional Republicans promise to scrutinize the nominee, but they say Mr. Clinton will get a chance to put his person in place for the debate over the department's future.
A bill to dismantle the department had been scheduled for a vote on April 29. It may now be delayed until June out of respect to Mr. Brown, Republican officials said.

HEADLINE: Even Before Deregulation, Cable Rates Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
For cable-television subscribers across the country, 1996 is starting to look a lot like 1986.
After a lull in recent years, cable rates are spiking up again -- more sharply than at any time since Congress deregulated the industry in the 1980's. In mailboxes from New York City to Norfolk, Va., and Seattle to Sacramento, Calif., cable subscribers have received the unwelcome news that their monthly bills are going up anywhere from 5 percent to 20 percent. 
 By June, when Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable operator, puts into effect its across-the-board rate increase of 13 percent, most of America's 63 million cable subscribers will be paying up to $3.50 more a month to watch CNN, MTV and the other channels that are part of basic cable service.
Cable operators said the increases were a necessary adjustment to the stringent rate cuts that the Government imposed on them in 1993, after a consumer backlash that prompted Congress to reregulate the industry. But critics said the industry was now seizing on loopholes in these rules to resume its practice of hefty rate increases.
"This is deja vu," said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of Consumers Union, a lobbying group in Washington that has been critical of the cable industry. "These rate increases rank with the largest that occurred after Congress first deregulated cable in 1984."
What makes this wave of increases remarkable is that it comes even before cable rates are to be deregulated yet again. Under the communications law passed earlier this year, all Government controls on cable prices are to be removed -- but not until 1999, as the result of a compromise between Republican and Democratic lawmakers.
The compromise assumed that by the end of the century, the industry would have vigorous enough competition from satellite television or telephone companies to prevent cable rates from soaring.
Until then, in theory, the Federal Communications Commission is supposed to keep a tight rein on cable rates, allowing increases only for inflation and programming costs. In practice, though, the current rules give cable operators leeway to pass along higher costs to customers.
So far, the rate increases have not ignited a nationwide consumer revolt like the one that prompted the Government to roll back rates in 1993. But complaints are starting to pile up in local government offices in cities like Sacramento, Portland, Ore., and Suffolk, Va.
And some industry experts said the increases could erode whatever consumer good will the cable industry garnered from 1993 through last year, when rates rose moderately and even declined in some markets.
"Twice now, the Government has allowed big rate increases and each time, the public image of the cable industry has gotten clobbered," said Paul Kagan, a leading cable-industry analyst.
But now, unlike in the 1980's, consumers may have little recourse to mushrooming cable rates. With Congress having passed an intricate bill that strips away most regulations from telecommunications companies of all sorts, even lawmakers who harshly criticized cable rates will have scant leverage to rein them in. Few in Washington can envision anyone upsetting the law's delicate balance of industry interests simply to punish the cable companies.
Proponents of deregulation argue that the competition unleashed by the bill will curb cable rates. But satellite broadcasters still reach barely 2 million customers -- compared with the 63 million served by cable. And most of the regional Bell companies are scaling back their plans to break into television.
Indeed, some analysts said the industry was pushing its rates now primarily to capitalize on its monopoly position. "They still have a window," said Dennis Leibowitz, a cable analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "They are doing it now because later competition will make it harder."
Almost all the big cable operators have carried out -- or announced -- rate increases since January. In New York City, Time Warner raised its rates 10.4 percent. The typical monthly bill for Manhattan subscribers rose $2.85, to $30.18 from $27.33, according to Richard Aurelio, the president of Time Warner Cable's New York City system.
Until now, Mr. Aurelio said, the company had never raised its rates by more than $1 in a single stroke. The reason the increase is so much higher this time, he said, is because it covered a longer period of time than previous increases.
Historically, cable companies estimated cost increases and inflation every quarter, and passed along those costs to customers in the following quarter. Now, though, the companies are projecting their cost increases for the entire coming year and figuring them into the current monthly bill.
The F.C.C. rules that make this possible grew out of prolonged period of tinkering after the commission temporarily froze rates in 1993. In 1994, the F.C.C. allowed companies to raise rates if they added new channels, and in January it permitted them to begin raising rates to account for the growing cost of their existing channels.
Because the F.C.C. took several months to devise the new rules, the new round of increases encompass the period from July 1995 to January 1997. So, in effect, the industry is taking a year and a half worth of rate increases in one shot.
Tele-Communications is using that rationale to justify its 13 percent average rate increase, or $3.03 a month, to $25.34 from $22.31. The company is putting through even larger increases in certain markets, where the cost of maintaining its cable networks is unusually high.In Denver, for example, its rates are going up 20 percent, while in Seattle and Portland, rates are going up between 15 percent and 18 percent.
"They're betting that this very aggressive increase will pass muster at the F.C.C.," said David Olsen, the director of cable communications for Portland. "As one local government, we'll do everything we can to make our opinions heard."
Given that the rate increases are legal, it is not clear what Mr. Olsen and other officials can do.
Still, the grass-roots protests are making cable executives nervous -- even prompting some to label each other as rate-mongers.
"Jerry Levin bragged to me about how large their increases were," said John C. Malone, the chief executive of Tele-Communications, referring to Gerald M. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner.
A spokesman for Time Warner said Mr. Levin was traveling and unavailable for comment.
In New York City, Time Warner has tried to take the edge off the increase by offering a full year of service at the old rates, if customers paid in advance for the coming year. The company even threw in one free month of service. Mr. Aurelio said that 5.6 percent of Time Warner's 1.1 million New York City subscribers had responded to the offer.
Other cable executives defended the increases on competitive grounds: The industry needs huge amounts of capital to upgrade its networks to carry the crystal-clear digital images and exotic interactive programs that they say consumers will demand in a few years.
"I really get offended by the criticism because we need the capital desperately," said Marc B. Nathanson, the chairman of Falcon Cable TV, a medium-size operator, with 1.1 million subscribers.
Falcon recently announced it would raise its average monthly bill by $1.14, from $22 to $23.14. Although that ranks as one of the industry's more modest increases, it has prompted fierce complaints in some of Falcon's service areas, including Suffolk, Va., a suburb of Norfolk where Falcon has 16,000 customers.
"I no longer subscribe to Falcon because we get Mickey Mouse service and exorbitant rates," said Richard R. Harris, a council member who signed up for DirecTV, a satellite broadcasting service owned by Hughes Communications, a unit of the General Motors Corporation.
Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the F.C.C. and the architect of the new rate regulations, acknowledged that this latest round of increases could alienate the very consumers that the telecommunications legislation was supposed to protect.
"Everybody thought Congress, cable and consumers had cut a deal," Mr. Hundt said. "I sure hope the compromise is not unraveling."

Rental Apartments Try A Comeback in Suburbs

BYLINE: By MARY MCALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
In suburban markets, developers who say they are responding to a lag in condominium and cooperative sales are increasingly turning to rentals. They say they are doing so in order to keep building and to serve a growing number of people who are unwilling or unable to commit to a purchase.
After the conversion craze of the 1980's, rental housing has been in growing demand in the suburbs. In Westchester County, for example, there was a 20 percent decline in rentals from 1980 to 1990, during which time 5,000 rental apartments disappeared. 
 The rentals being built today, however, do not fit the traditional image of tall, flat-roofed, brick buildings with no amenities. Instead, today's suburban rentals are more often low-rise garden apartment complexes with swimming pools and parking garages, perks normally associated with condominiums.
In Westchester County there are now about 10 rental projects being built or in the planning stages. Developers maintain that a change in attitude on the part of communities has allowed for the spurt of construction.
"Communities have gotten more sophisticated about the need for housing populations within the areas where they work," said Robert Weinberg, chairman of the Robert Martin Company, a developer and property owner based in Elmsford. "They're more inclined to work with the developer now to come up with a project that benefits everyone."
In one of its corporate parks, called Talleyrand, in Tarrytown, Robert Martin plans to break ground this summer on a rental complex of 300 one- and two-bedroom apartments, some with dens. They are expected to rent for $800 to $1,400 a month.
The complex will be colonial-style, with buildings "two to three stories high," said Jerome Rockhill, vice president for design and development. "And there'll be a parking garage underneath."
The housing will share the park with two existing office buildings and a T.G.I.F. restaurant. Robert Martin retains the right to build one additional office building.
The company is also planning another project that could have 600 to 700 units in the town of Greenburgh, "We're in negotiations now with the community to work out the number of units and determine the impacts on traffic and services," Mr. Weinberg said.
Both rental projects are designed to "serve an income bracket that's now caught in the middle," Mr. Weinberg said. "People who make $45,000 to $65,000 a year have too much money to qualify for a subsidy, but not enough for a down payment on a town house or condo."
The emergence of rentals is also a response, developers say, to the feeling of job insecurity that is so widespread today. "Every day we're hearing about people laid off somewhere," said Michael Seidner, a principal with Continental Properties of Edison, N.J. "People don't feel confident enough in their jobs to make the commitment to buy a house or condo now."
Mr. Seidner's company is now building two rental projects in Edison and planning a third. One is called Village Court, a 14-building complex with 248 apartments of one and two bedrooms, renting for $800 to $900. It is about two-thirds completed, Mr. Seidner said.
The other, Talmadge Village Estates, is now in the beginning stages of construction, and will offer one- and three-bedroom apartments and feature a parking garage. "It's very unusual to find a three-bedroom rental apartment in a complex with a parking garage," Mr. Seidner said.
Developers predict that some of the vacant office and factory space in many suburbs could one day be converted into rentals. In January, Scarsdale Associates of Manhattan, asked the Westchester village of Tuckahoe for permission to build 160 luxury apartments and a 70,000-square-foot supermarket in a former Revlon factory that has been vacant for over a decade.
There has been community opposition to the plan, based on the number of units and size of the supermarket, "but there's no objection to the fact that they're rentals," Mayor Philip White said.
One-bedroom rents in the village now start at $1,100 and go to $1,500 for two bedrooms, said Philly Scoca, owner of Village Realty. "I know I can't afford that," Ms. Scoca said. "They can get those rents now because demand far outstrips supply."
Rentals make economic sense for communities, according to Mr. Weinberg, because "they attract mostly two-career couples, singles and some older people."

HEADLINE: Developer Buys the Rights to Build a Times Square Tower

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
A Manhattan developer has acquired the right to construct a large office tower at the northeast corner of 42d Street and Broadway in Times Square, taking over part of a vast development proposal that has been stalled for 15 years.
The developer, Douglas Durst, has agreed to buy the rights to the site from a group headed by the Prudential Insurance Company of America. If Mr. Durst's plan succeeds -- and it is subject to approval by both the city and state, which is by no means assured -- his project would be the first new privately financed office building since 1992 in Manhattan, where an office glut has discouraged builders. 
 It would also break a logjam in the big development scheme for what New Yorkers once proudly described as the Crossroads of the World, an intersection that had grown tawdry and blighted since the 1950's but now shows signs of a renaissance in entertainment and shopping.
Prudential and its partner, George Klein, a large Manhattan builder, said they had agreed to Mr. Durst's terms in February, but no one involved in the deal would disclose how much Mr. Durst would pay. He has since submitted outlines of his plan to the city and state.
The site stretches from 42d Street to 43d Street, including the boarded-up hulk of the former Nathan's Famous restaurant, long a Times Square institution. In addition to the parcel controlled by Prudential, Mr. Durst would include adjacent property he owns, expanding the base of the proposed building by about 30 percent.
"The timing of this decision is based on what we see as the strength of the office market," he said in an interview, adding that he intended to build his office tower even if no large tenant is immediately found.
The Prudential group was selected in 1981 to develop four huge office towers on the south end of Times Square. It won the promise of long-term tax breaks from city and state officials, who hoped that the office buildings would lead a rebirth in the area.
But the plan provoked a torrent of lawsuits, and protests by civic groups upset at the huge scale of the proposed towers, which they said would overwhelm the congested intersection.
While the project was blocked by litigation, other developers began building at the north end of Times Square during the late 1980's, creating an office glut and postponing the Prudential plan.
Over the last two years, the Disney Company and other investors have moved in, investing heavily to renovate 42d Street theaters and open splashy new stores, sowing the seeds of renewal that were to have come from Prudential's towers.
Mr. Durst's plan contains an added twist because he and his company, the Durst Organization, had been among the most outspoken critics of the tax breaks offered to the Prudential group, saying they favored one builder over other property owners.
But now, Mr. Durst said, the time has come to build, and he intends to claim 35 percent of the Prudential group's long-term tax breaks, which apply to his building site.
Mr. Durst's plan comes when the office vacancy rate in midtown Manhattan has been shrinking, to 12 percent at the end of last year from a high of 17 percent in 1990, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a brokerage. He said he expected an increase in demand by 1999, the earliest his tower could be completed.
Top economic development officials for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki said they would like to see Mr. Durst's plan succeed. The city and state must agree to the transfer of tax breaks that had been pledged to Prudential, and to the design and size of Mr. Durst's building.
But John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, said he would insist that Mr. Durst have a commitment to his building by at least one large tenant as a form of insurance that it be built quickly. "As a business deal, we are not there yet," Mr. Dyson said.
State officials may hold greater sway over the plan, since the state, through its condemnation powers, has already acquired the land under Prudential's building sites, as well as several other parcels along 42d Street.
"I feel comfortable this deal will go ahead," said Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. He said the agency planned a public hearing on Mr. Durst's plan for May 6. But like Mr. Dyson, he said some assurance that an anchor tenant has signed would be required by the state.
Mr. Durst, while saying he would be confident enough in his building's prospects even without an immediate commitment from a large tenant, said he was aggressively seeking one and might have a commitment within weeks.
But he denied speculation that Conde Nast, the publishing company, was interested in the site for a headquarters. "I've had discussions with them, but they did not go anywhere," Mr. Durst said.
Mr. Durst declined to say how large his tower would be, saying that that is being negotiated. But someone close to the discussions who insisted on anonymity said Mr. Durst wanted about the same square footage as Prudential had proposed, though the building would not be as tall because it would be on a larger site. Prudential's plan was for a 58-story building.
If Mr. Durst does not try to exceed the floor area that Prudential wanted, he seems likely to avoid some of the opposition the greeted the Prudential group in the 1980's.
The buildings at the other three Prudential sites -- at the southeast corner of 42d Street and Broadway, the southwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue and the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue -- are undergoing renovation at street level to accommodate 19 new stores, including gift shops and delicatessens, which are to open by the end of the year.
The work is being performed by the Prudential group as part of an interim agreement with the city and state two years ago that enables it to put off construction of its office towers until office demand picks up.
But with Mr. Durst planning his tower, the Prudential group may push forward its plan to build, said Michelle Demilly, a spokeswoman.
"Development on one site will certainly spur development on the other three," she said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Close Mostly Higher

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices closed slightly higher yesterday after a report on producer prices eased worries among some market participants that inflation could accelerate.
In the corporate bond market, Donald J. Trump and affiliates sold $1.2 billion of 10-year junk notes -- or 9 percent more than planned -- to help finance the merger of the Trump Plaza and Trump Taj Mahal casinos in Atlantic City. 
 The Labor Department reported yesterday that the Producer Price Index rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March, while the so-called core index, which excludes food and energy price rises, edged up a slim one-tenth of 1 percent. Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.
The core figure indicated that the recent jump in commodity prices was not yet being passed along by wholesalers to retailers, analysts said, which calmed some investors.
"The market very quickly focused in on the fact that core prices are not rising at any level," said Christopher Low of HSBC Markets Inc.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond swung during the session and ended up 4/32 at 884/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.93 percent, from 6.94 percent on Wednesday.
Although the producer price data were roughly in line with expectations, analysts said the market's jitters over inflation in the medium-term were not past.
The Producer Price Index "convinced the market that at least for one month things are still going O.K.," Mr. Low said. "But people are still worried."
One source of concern, analysts said, was another rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodities to a fresh eight-year high. The index rose 1.75 points, to 260.66 points.
Investors will be watching another inflation report today, the Government's release of the Consumer Price Index and the retail sales reports for March.
Bond prices were also bolstered by remarks from a Federal Reserve Board governor, Janet Yellen. In a speech she said she saw no significant impact on inflation from wage pressures.
Analysts have been worried about a possible minimum wage increase, which could put more money into people's pockets, fuel consumer demand and spark inflation.
Traders said the Fed's two coupon passes yesterday, although not bold, also underpinned Treasury prices.
"The Fed was not a very aggressive buyer of securities," said Patrick Dimick of CS First Boston.
In the first intervention, the central bank bought coupons maturing Oct. 15, 1996, to Sept. 30, 1998, for settlement on April 15. Later, the Fed purchased coupons maturing from Oct. 15, 1998, to Feb. 15, 2003, for delivery on Monday.
A coupon pass occurs when the Fed comes to the market to buy certain maturities to add cash to the banking system. While it is not a signal of any change in monetary policy, the coupon pass presents dealers with an opportunity to sell Treasuries to a ready buyer.
Analysts said they expect the market to remain in narrow ranges over the next few days with yields around 7 percent.
"I think 7 percent bonds are probably going to be viewed as reasonable value, 7 percent makes sense given where inflation is," said James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc.
In trading in corporate bonds, Trump Atlantic City Associates' 10-year first mortgage notes, callable after five years, were priced at par to yield 11.25 percent, a quarter percentage point above the yields previously estimated.
But investor demand was strong and the size of the offering was increased yesterday to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion. Originally, the deal had been decreased slightly, from $1.18 billion to $1.1 billion.
Mr. Trump will use the proceeds of the offering to merge the Taj Mahal in which he owns a 50 percent stake -- into Trump Hotels, which operates the Trump Plaza and a still-to-open riverboat gaming operation in Indiana. The merger, approved by shareholders and bondholders yesterday, is expected to close Wednesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Enlists Rich Nations in Move to End Business Bribes

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 11

 BODY:
Under intense pressure from the United States, the world's richest nations today took an important step to fight corruption in international business dealings by agreeing that bribes paid to foreign officials, often listed as commissions or fees, should no longer be tax deductible.
The United States, which is the only major nation that has laws barring its companies from paying bribes abroad, has long argued that Americans are often at a disadvantage in bidding for major contracts around the world. 
 But rather than weaken its own rules, a move some American business executives wanted, Washington has enlisted its main rivals and others to join an anti-bribery campaign.
Today's decision by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of industrial countries, commits its 26 members to rewrite tax rules that have effectively encouraged the bribery of foreign officials by making such payoffs tax deductible.
"This is a sea change, a very important step in breaking the international chain of corruption," said David Aaron, the American representative at the organization. "It takes governments out of the business of subsidizing corruption by giving tax breaks for bribery.
"It may sound ludicrous to declare a bribe as a tax deduction, but that is simply a measure of how ingrained this habit was."
While all the O.E.C.D. countries have laws against domestic corruption, most of these rules do not apply to what their executives do abroad.
On the contrary, most industrialized countries allow businesses to deduct payoffs and kickbacks, commonly described as commissions or fees or promotional costs, from their taxable income as a legitimate expense.
Business executives and diplomats from several European countries said they believed that in countries with strong tax systems, the proposed changes should have an effect on business practices because large payments to officials will not be deductible.
But some said that given the stiff competition for what are often multibillion-dollar contracts in construction, armaments, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals, entrepreneurs may try to find loopholes.
They noted that some American companies, barred from paying graft, have hired middlemen to handle such matters, and that some regularly woo prospective clients by inviting them on junkets to the United States that include gambling stops at Las Vegas or Atlantic City or visits to Disney World.
A number of American companies do not need to disclose foreign payments if they are involved in "national security" work.
In most cases -- but not in the United States, Britain and Canada -- payments to foreign officials have been tax deductible as long as the recipient is identified by name. Laws are most lax in Belgium, Luxembourg and Greece, which have not even required the recipient's name.
In each country, Governments are expected to propose legislation tightening tax laws, which will be subject to parliamentary approval.
The group gave the member countries no deadline for revising their tax codes, but it ordered a watchdog committee to monitor the changes with instructions to report back within a year.
The O.E.C.D. does not have the power to make its agreements legally binding; it works through peer pressure, and its decisions amount to strong commitments by the members.
American diplomats said they hoped the next step would be to make payoffs to foreign officials a crime, as they are under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practises Act of 1977.
The Council for International Business in New York, one of many American groups that has lobbied against bribery as an unfair business practice, applauded the move.
"We are very pleased that the O.E.C.D. has gone much further and much faster than we anticipated," said Sheila O'Neil, a council official, noting that when talks began in 1994 "there wasn't much of a consensus."
Insiders said negotiations had been difficult, with countries with powerful ministries in charge of commerce or exports, like Germany, Japan and France, at first arguing that they could not put obstacles in the way of exporters. But they said the issue gained momentum in recent months as big bribery scandals have come to light affecting many governments. "We think everyone has begun to see the huge social and economic and political consequences of bribery," Ms. O'Neil said.
American diplomats who have worked on the anti-bribery issue said they felt vindicated as the 26 Governments approved today's anti-bribery move by consensus.
"We were considered naive Americans for pushing this issue," Mr. Aaron said. "Now many others recognize there is a serious problem."
Since 1977 several dozen American companies have been charged with violating the anti-bribery law, but no chief executive has been convicted.
Today's decision is part of a broad crusade by the Clinton Administration, which has said that bribery used by America's rivals represents a real if invisible form of trade barrier. It has said bribery inhibits American exports and cost Americans jobs, all the more so in the present rush toward the globalization of business, with opportunities growing rapidly in Eastern Europe and Asia. Large American companies, including General Electric and Boeing, have openly complained that they have difficulty competing for contracts with European rivals who are free to use bribes.
In March the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, calling bribery an unfair tariff, said, "Last year, from April 1994 to May 1995, the U.S. Government learned of almost 100 cases in which foreign bribes undercut U.S. firms' ability to win contracts valued at $45 billion."
He added that the Administration's goal was "to level the playing field and make the rules fair by eliminating his pernicious practice."
The Clinton Administration is not alone. Several West European governments have said that they are in favor of addressing the issues of bribes and extortion in future loan and aid agreements and have begun debating at the O.E.C.D. the question of how to police development aid.
Two weeks ago the International Chamber of Commerce, based in Paris and with members from more than 130 countries, published new rules on how to handle extortion and bribery.
"We are definitely noticing a change in attitude," said Karen Hussmann, an official of Transparency International, a Berlin-based group that fights corruption. "Many governments and companies are becoming sensitized to the devastating impact of corruption."
On March 29 the United States was successful in its campaign to have the Organization of American States adopt an Inter-American Convention Against Corruption.
Next, the Clinton Administration has said, it wants to put corporate bribery on the agenda of the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization in Singapore later this year.

HEADLINE: BOXING;
No Title Fight Is Complete Without Palm Trees

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI 

DATELINE: ST. MAARTEN, Netherlands Antilles, April 11

 BODY:
Pernell Whitaker, bored with yet another opponent he says he has never seen fight, will put his welterweight title at risk Friday night in this unlikely setting.
Unlike Whitaker, the island is attempting a comeback after a hurricane roared through here for more than a day last September and left only a third of the hotel rooms still usable. 
 So the commissioner of boxing, Jacinth Bryan Labega -- "My husband used to be a fighter; we love the sport." -- is cheerleading a championship doubleheader that she hopes will not only bring back the fight game but also the tourists.
Whitaker will earn $2.5 million, thanks to some French promoters and Home Box Office, for his fight against the unbeaten Wilfredo Rivera.
But one wonders after six world titles in four weight classes and an 11-year career at the top, whether he is in the position to be toppled at the age of 32. How long can he keep saying that he has no interest in fighting, that he doesn't watch his opponents and that he needs extra-special incentive to be motivated?
For this fight, he brought his wife and four children and what seems to be all the kids on the block he grew up with.
Rivera, with a 23-0-1 record, is the World Boxing Council's No. 1 challenger. Teddy Atlas, who once trained him, describes Rivera as "careful and cautious, a very good technician who is not going to let Pernell sucker him."
Whitaker, an outstanding defensive fighter, has also drawn many of his opponents out of their game plan with his maddening moves, which include ducking and crouching so that his knees almost touch the mat.
The semifinal, also a welterweight championship, kicks off the HBO telecast at 9:30 P.M. It features Ike Quartey, who holds the World Boxing Association title, against Vince Phillips, a onetime New Yorker.
It is possible that if Whitaker and Quartey win, they will meet to unify the title -- sort of. Felix Trinidad, another outstanding performer, is the International Boxing Federation welterweight ruler.
Phillips graduated from Taft High School in the Bronx and attended Pensacola (Fla.) Junior College. He was a baseball pitcher as well.
"But they cut me because they said I didn't have a 90-mile-an-hour fastball," he said.
"Now he's got a 90-mile-an-hour right hand," said one of his handlers, Akbar Muhammad.
Phillips has a 33-1 record with 22 knockouts. Quartey, from Ghana, is 31-1 with 27 knockouts.
Whitaker has been training with the same unorthodox moves that have enabled him to post a 37-1-1 record since becoming an Olympic champion at Los Angeles 12 years ago. But he has seemed uninterested these last weeks, becoming animated only when discussing his unofficial crown as the world's best pound-for-pound fighter -- a shaky crown, at that, with the supermiddleweight champion Roy Jones Jr. beating up opponents.
Whitaker arrived around midnight on Tuesday after having a long day punctuated by a snow-interrupted flight from Newark. The temperature will be in the high 70's by fight time.
To keep the Caribbean look for its television audience, HBO stationed its main camera on the side of the ring overlooking the azure water. The background seemed a little bare, though, so palm trees were brought in from another part of the island and planted in the distance.
No one in the audience should have trouble seeing the fighters. The action will take place in a sort of courtyard at a gambling casino-hotel. There will be only 1,000 people in attendance -- and 700 of them have been invited free, from the United States, Europe and South America, because they are high-stakes gamblers. It cost more than $11,000 to ship the ring by container from New Jersey. It has been set up over the fountain in the courtyard.
St. Maarten is about a 30-minute flight east of Puerto Rico. It is a small place, with only about 80,000 residents.
Theo Heyliger, whose business card reads "Commissioner in charge of tourism, economic affairs, public transportation, energy affairs and harbor," is hoping that the fight card will demonstrate that the island is recovering.

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Earnings Rise; First Union Shows Decline

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company said yesterday that earnings rose 72 percent in the first quarter as trading profits surged.
Bank of New York also reported a strong gain. Earnings at First Union, however, fell, reflecting costs related to its acquisition of First Fidelity of Newark. 
 J. P. Morgan, the nation's fifth-biggest banking company, said net income rose to $439 million, or $2.13 a share, from $255 million, or $1.27, in the quarter a year earlier.
Analysts had expected the company, which offers commercial and investment banking services, to earn about $1.71 a share, based on a survey of 15 analysts by IBES International Inc.
But shares of J. P. Morgan fell $1.875, to $77.125, on concerns that profits from trading would decline. Trading revenue more than doubled to $758 million in the quarter -- almost twice as high as analysts expected.
"People may be questioning whether that level of trading gains is sustainable, which it's probably not," said Robert Maneri, an analyst with Society Asset Management.
Still, the stock decline came amid a general selloff in banking issues prompted by concerns that this year's rise in interest rates could slow loan growth and shrink lending margins.
J. P. Morgan, based in New York, is one of the biggest traders in the world. It had an explosive quarter, recording $602 million in trading revenue, compared with $303 million a year ago.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods raised its earnings estimate for 1996 to $7.50 a share from $7 after the earnings were announced, and Merrill Lynch & Company said it expected to raise its estimate as well.
First Union, based in Charlotte, N.C., reported earnings of $242.9 million, or 85 cents a share, down from $349.8 million, or $1.19 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The recent quarter included $181 million in charges for costs of the acquisition of First Fidelity, which it completed in January.
But operating profits rose to $424 million, or $1.50 a share, from net income of $349.8 million, or $1.19, a year earlier.
"The $1.50 pretty much proves that they're going to have no trouble in hitting the $6.30 that they've projected for the year," said Richard Bove, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates.
Shares of First Union rose 75 cents yesterday, to $58.25.
The Bank of New York Company said first-quarter earnings rose 14 percent on increased lending and higher revenue in the company's securities-processing business.
Earnings rose to $243 million, or $1.16 a share, from $213 million, or $1.12, a year ago. The results exceeded analysts' expectations of $1.14 a share, based on a survey of 19 analysts by IBES.
"Fee-based income is doing very well across the board," said Thomas Hanley, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc.
The banking company said net interest income rose to $517 million from $502 million because of increased lending.
Bank of New York shares fell 87.5 cents, to $48.

HEADLINE: Experts Say Stadium Plan Would Cut Yankees' Take

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Ticket sales, luxury suites and other revenue will not raise enough cash to pay for the $1 billion West Side stadium envisioned by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani without cutting deeply into the profits of the Yankees or any other sports tenant, experts familiar with the financing of stadiums in other cities said.
That fact, the experts said, suggests that the plan Mr. Giuliani has endorsed as the most fiscally sound way to keep the Yankees from leaving New York City with minimal cost to taxpayers, may be impracticable. 
 "It is undoable," said John Moag Jr., chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority, which financed Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore and has lured the former Cleveland Browns to play in an adjacent football stadium.
"It's hard to think of the funding sources to get that high," said Mitchell Zietz, senior management consultant at Public Financial Management, a Philadelphia-based consulting firm.
At least $90 million a year would be needed to pay off the state bonds that would finance construction of the stadium, which would be the most expensive ever built by far. That would almost equal the $107 million combined annual debt payments for eight recently built or planned stadiums in Denver, Baltimore, Cleveland, Nashville, Arlington, Tex., and Cincinnati.
Raising the $90 million through the sale of tickets, luxury boxes and beer would require crowds of at least 40,000 for Yankee games, 66,500 for football games (if a team is found), and the sale of between 120 and 220 luxury suites, costing up to $175,000 each, according to a study done for New York City, the state and the Yankees. And it would require that the city and state get enormous percentages of that revenue from the teams, including a significant portion of the Yankees' profits.
The debt would also have to be covered by revenue from other events anticipated by Mr. Giuliani, like conventions, Super Bowls and the N.C.A.A. basketball Final Four.
A 70,000 seat multipurpose stadium with a retractable dome, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, would give the city "an asset that it does not presently have, that cities far smaller than New York now have, and that allow them to outbid us, and to beat us, in terms of being able to bring conventions to their city."
But the Yankees, with 81 dates a year, are for now the only permanent tenant in sight. The Jets have a lease in New Jersey through 2008. And crucial to the final decision will be how much of the Yankees' lucrative cash flow George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner, would be willing to surrender.
Mr. Steinbrenner, who is dissatisfied with the money-making potential of Yankee Stadium, would be expected to bear some of the financing burden, but it may be excessive to expect him to dedicate more than a small share of his revenue to the debt, especially without a football cotenant on the horizon.
The Mayor may ask Mr. Steinbrenner to concede all or some money from areas like beverage-pouring rights, luxury suites, stadium-naming fees and personal seat licenses, which are one-time fees for the right to buy season tickets.
"Look, this is all pie in the sky," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch. "George Steinbrenner is yanking Rudy Giuliani's chain. He won't give up a nickel that he thinks he can get, from parking to frankfurters to boxes. He won't give up a French sou, let alone an American dollar."
At $1 billion, the two-sport, retractable dome stadium envisioned by the Mayor next to the Hudson River between 30th and 33d streets would cost four times what the San Francisco Giants are raising without government aid for a privately financed ballpark in the city's China Basin area. And the cost is nearly twice what the multipurpose Skydome in Toronto cost several years ago.
The steep price boggles many in the stadium business. But Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, the architectural firm that studied the site on the West Side of Manhattan, said the cost is necessary because a $103 million concrete platform must be built over the rail yards on the site; numerous highway, road and mass transit improvements are necessary, and the cost of doing business in New York City is astronomical.
The $388 million cost of the two-sport stadium structure alone is equaled by various infrastructure costs and provisions for cost overruns and inflation.
"The costs are based on historic precedent," said Tim Delorm, the architect who was in charge of the study.
Mayor Giuliani, who had dinner Tuesday with Mr. Steinbrenner, has begun to pinpoint stadium revenue sources that could finance the debt, said people familiar with the process.
Mr. Giuliani said Wednesday: "We had a very interesting conversation," which included discussions about the West Side and Yankee Stadium, "and the things the Yankees are going to have to do to make a decision and the things that the city has to focus on, even beyond the Yankees, for the best interests of the city."
He said the next step was to take a "very, very close look" at financing.
"And there are different ways to do it," he said, adding that he would like to resolve the situation by the end of the year.
A financial analysis of the West Side site by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, found that a dual purpose stadium would generate revenue of $199 million, while a baseball-only facility would produce $129.6 million.
According to Financial World magazine, the Yankees generated $32.5 million in gross revenue from gate receipts and other stadium sources, including luxury boxes, in the strike-shortened 1994 season. Figures from Financial World and the Parks Department place the 1995 gross revenue estimate at $45 million. The numbers exclude the Yankees' estimated $45 million cable television rights payment.
For the state and city to try to finance $90 million in debt payments from a multipurpose stadium, it would require nearly half of the stadium's $199 million revenue estimated by Peat Marwick. To finance the debt from a baseball-only stadium would take two-thirds of the estimated $129 million in revenue.
"For an owner to give up a lot of money, it means cutting into the value of his team," said Michael Ozanian, deputy editor of Financial World.
The Peat Marwick analysis has buoyed Mr. Giuliani, who has touted the dual-purpose stadium with a retractable dome and artificial turf as the easiest option to finance. The revenue, he said, "would be off the charts."
"It's something the city of New York will appreciate 20 to 30 years from now," the Mayor said yesterday.
Peat Marwick's findings, which sports-financing experts say may be unrealistic, include these:
*An average of 40,750 people would pay an average of $15.46 for tickets to watch Yankee games, and 66,500 would pay an average of $34.56 for tickets to watch football, providing revenue of $74.2 million. The estimated attendance for baseball would be 67 percent above the Yankees' average of 24,293 during last year's shortened season.
*One hundred twenty luxury suites for baseball would sell out at $150,000 each, and 220 suites for football, the sports with a greater demand for suites, would sell out at $175,000 apiece, providing revenue of $38.5 million.
*Eight thousand cushy club seats for baseball would sell for $3,500 each and 16,000 for football would sell for $3,000 each, providing revenue that could reach $76 million.
"That assumption is so excessive as not to be reachable," said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd., a Chicago-based consulting firm. "A $3,500 premium for a baseball club seats -- where baseball club seats have not done all that well -- is excessive. And 8,000 is a lot when you consider that 25,000 is a great number for a team's total season ticket base."
If Mr. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki pursue the West Side option without enough financing from stadium revenue, they would have to consider using other sources of money that are common to such projects, including sales taxes, taxing tickets for sports and other entertainment events, taxes on alcohol, wine, cigarettes, hotel rooms and car rentals, or a special sports lottery.
Some of the taxes would be politically untenable; the city sales tax of 8 1/2 percent is already high, the hotel tax was recently reduced from an onerous level to make the city more competitive, and any increase in "sin taxes" would be protested by the liquor, beer and tobacco lobbies.
A lottery directing all of its proceeds into a stadium fund would require special legislation, said Rick Grenell, a spokesman for the New York State Lottery. "Right now, all our profits have to go into education," he said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Sales of U.S. Autos Up 50% in Japan Since Trade Accord

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
Ten months after the United States reached a high-stakes accord with Japan over automobile trade, President Clinton is set to announce that sales of American cars in the Japanese market have surged 50 percent and that Japanese auto makers have begun buying far larger quantities of American parts.
Mr. Clinton will make a formal announcement of the figures in the White House on Friday, Administation officials said today. The announcement will come two days before Mr. Clinton departs on his second state visit to Japan, and just as the Ford Motor Company moves to tighten its control of the Mazda Motor Corporation of Japan. [Page D1.] 
 While the President's claims of success in an area that has stymied his predecessors for 20 years are clearly tinged with politics -- Senator Bob Dole, his Republican opponent in November, is already talking about stricter enforcement of trade accords -- the numbers are promising enough for Mr. Clinton to make a case that his brinksmanship with Tokyo is beginning to pay off.
Asked why the President will be personally appearing to talk about mufflers, roof racks and auto repair, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, told reporters today: "We've got bragging rights, so we'll claim them. Is that straightforward enough?"
According to officials familiar with the plans for the Friday presentation, Mr. Clinton will announce that since the accord was reached in June, the Japanese Government has certified 730 automotive garages that are independent of Toyota, Nissan and the other major Japanese auto manufacturers, freeing the garages to carry American-made replacement parts, from shock absorbers to power-steering systems. Until now, such repairs could only be made by Government-certified garages that were tied to the Japanese auto industry.
Moreover, sales of American cars in Japan, which were running at about 10,000 a month before the accord, jumped to about 15,000 a month in the last quarter of 1995.
Even some of the makers of auto parts who were skeptical of the value of the accord struck in late June now say they believe that a change in attitudes has begun to set in.
"It is a remarkable shift," said Robert E. Cole, a vice president of Kaiser Aluminum and chairman of a committee that advises the Government on automotive trade. "In some cases we have seen the numbers really jump. But more importantly, we're seeing sincere interest in what we have to offer. That rarely happened before."
The auto accord was negotiated in Geneva between Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is now Japan's Prime Minister. It was the biggest of the 20 agreements that have been struck with Japan since Mr. Clinton's last trip to Tokyo, in July 1993, and the one on which the Administration bargained hardest. The American side threatened to ban the import of Japanese luxury cars if Japan refused to accede to the American demands.
In the end, as in all trade negotiations, the Administration got considerably less than it had originally demanded. Mr. Hashimoto, for example, fought off efforts to force the Japanese auto makers to buy far more American parts for their Japanese factories, though the accord called for big increases in the use of American-made parts in Japanese "transplant" factories in the United States.
And Japan refused to agree to any specific purchasing targets; instead, Mr. Kantor was given nonbinding, sometimes vague, estimates by Japanese auto makers of their plans to import parts over the next several years; the United States then translated those estimates into more specific numbers.
But with two notable exceptions, the agreement has already resulted in significantly more progress than Mr. Kantor, the President's campaign manager in 1992, had expected last summer. Toyota has announced that by 1998, three-quarters of the vehicles it sells in the United States will be made in the United States. The Japanese Government has followed through on virtually all of its commitments to streamline regulations that American companies complained were intended to aid the home team, especially rules that limited the sale of foreign-made replacement parts, a $60 billion market in Japan.
But resistance continues in some areas, including the creation of more dealerships in Japan for American autos. Last June, Mr. Kantor said that he expected 200 new dealers by the end of the first year of the accord; in fact, agreements that have been struck so far would create only 30. And increases in sales of American parts to Toyota, Nissan and Honda, Japan's big three, have only been modest, though there is often a lag of three years between the time that a new part is "designed in" to a new model and the time those shipments begin to show up in trade statistics.
Still, the United States Transportation Department reported recently that the North American content of Japanese-made cars this year is up 14 percent, compared with 1995 models. Cars made by Japanese companies in the United States average more than 50 percent American content this year for the first time, a statistic that allows Mr. Clinton to make the campaign statement that he has succeeded in creating jobs for American workers.
The question that economists and statisticians cannot answer convincingly is how much of this change would have happened anyway. The strength of the yen in the first half of the 1990's created a constant incentive for Japanese manufacturers to buy more imports; they were only constrained by the fear of a social backlash if they began to lay off Japanese workers in large numbers.
"You could argue that the big change came in 1992, when the Big Three chief executives came to Japan with President Bush and were so embarrassed back at home," said J. Michael Farren, a top Commerce Department official at the time. "When they came back, they began to invest in Japan seriously."

Wall Street Begins to Fear Market May Continue Slide
After five days of declines, Wall Street's spirits are being dampened by a nasty suspicion that the stock market may not always rise. Worries about inflation are probably the chief culprit. Commodity prices are hitting new highs, and bond yields are climbing quite close to 7 percent. Market Place. [Page A1.]
 
Most stocks fell again, with the S. & P. 500 stock index off 2.32 points, to 631.18, and the Nasdaq composite down 8.14, to 1,097.14. But the Dow industrials eked out a gain of 1.09 points, to 5,487.07. [D7.]

American Cars Selling in Japan
Sales of American cars in Japan have surged 50 percent, and Japanese auto makers are lifting purchases of American parts, 10 months after Washington and Tokyo reached a high-stakes accord over the automotive trade, Administration officials said. [A1.]
 
A $1.2 Billion Broadcasting Deal
The Sinclair Broadcast Group of Baltimore agreed to buy River City Broadcasting of St. Louis for $1.2 billion. The deal, made possible be the recent overhaul of telecommunications laws, will form the nation's seventh-largest television holding company. [D4.]
 
China and France in Jet Deal
China and France signed a preliminary agreement to study joint development of a 100-seat jet. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have also been seeking to team up with the Chinese to build a new plane. [D2.]
 
J. P. Morgan Profits Jump 72%
J. P. Morgan benefited from surging trading profits in the first quarter. Bank of New York also had a strong gain, but First Union's profits fell, reflecting an acquisition. [D6.]
 
Kmart Plans Integrity Pledge
Kmart plans to require all employees and vendors to sign an "integrity pledge" related to gifts and kickbacks. [D2.]
 
Retail Sales Up on Easter Buying
Retails sales rose 4.23 percent in March, according to Goldman Sachs, but analysts cautioned that much of the gain was buying for Easter, and that April sales could lag. [D3.]
 
News on the Web, for a Fee
Time Warner plans to begin charging a monthly fee for a personalized news delivery system on the World Wide Web. It would let users of Compuserve gain access to the service without charge. [D6.]
 
O.E.C.D. in Anti-Bribery Stance
Under pressure from the United States, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, representing the world's richest nations, agreed that bribes paid to foreign officials, often listed as commissions or fees, should no longer be tax-deductible. [A10.]
 
A New Tower for Times Square?
A Manhattan developer, Douglas Durst, has acquired from Prudential Insurance the right to construct a large office tower at the corner of 42d Street and Broadway in Times Square where Nathan's Famous stood. Subject to city and state approval, he would take over part of a vast development proposal that has been stalled for 15 years. Terms were not disclosed. [B1.]
 
Clinton Backs Pension Proposals
President Clinton repackaged a batch of proposals to expand workers' pension rights into a broad bill that has little chance of passage but could be a popular manifesto in his Presidential campaign. [A19.]

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Time of Testing In Love Affair With Wall St.

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
While the rest of New York enjoyed a beautiful spring day, it was drizzling yesterday on Wall Street, where spirits are being dampened by the nasty suspicion that maybe, just maybe, the stock market will not continue to go up forever.
Such a suggestion has almost become heresy this year as the market has soared, aided by low interest rates and a flood of money from average Americans, many of them investing for their retirements. These often inexperienced investors have been told that every decline is just a chance to pick up a bargain. And until now, that has been right. 
 Most stock prices have been falling since last Thursday. And while blue-chip stocks managed to eke out a gain yesterday -- the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.09 points, to 5,487.07 -- it capped the worst five trading days for the market in two years. For the first time in a long time, the stock market is not immediately bouncing back from bad days and bad news.
The immediate culprit is probably worries about inflation; commodity prices are hitting highs, and bond yields are climbing awfully close to 7 percent. "Until last week confidence was very high that inflation was not a problem, rising interest rates are not a problem, the Fed is not a problem," said Michael Metz, the chief strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. "Now the whole story is gone, and it was the only justification for a market that otherwise looks extremely overvalued."
Which leaves the stock market relying on Russ Roach.
Mr. Roach is not a market guru; he is a state legislator in Oklahoma who found a great way to increase the size of his campaign war chest -- by investing a big chunk of it in the stock market. In fact, he concentrated his bet on just one stock and scored big with a gain of more than 60 percent in just 11 months.
From the floor of the House of Representatives in Oklahoma City, Mr. Roach, a Tulsa Democrat, said he was quite an experienced investor -- he owns about seven stocks and six mutual funds -- and that he did not rely on a hot tip to put his money in the Williams Companies, a local pipeline concern. It was, he said, "a very safe investment."
Such serene confidence in the stock market, the almost complete lack of fear, seems to characterize investing in the 90's. It is part of the phenomenon of billions of dollars flooding into stock mutual funds -- as much in the first three months of this year as in all of 1994 -- and Congress seriously proposing that Social Security money be invested in stocks.
Indeed, it may be a kind of New Age Ebullience. It used to be that the stock market madness that signaled trouble was symbolized by guys guzzling champagne and throwing big bills out the windows of Rolls-Royces; today, market mania may be characterized by retirees-to-be confidently shoveling their cash into stocks, believing that over the long run, whatever that may be, the market will rise.
So far, the weak market does not seem to have soured average investors, at least those who buy mutual funds. At Charles Schwab & Company, a discount brokerage concern, investors sold slightly more stocks than they bought in the month through April 10 -- $2.18 billion versus $2.22 billion. But they bought more stock mutual funds, for $1.25 billion, than they sold, for $800 million.
Whether the new love affair of Americans for equities is a good sign or not depends on the point of view of the analysts -- and, probably, their ages. It used to be that when individual investors got interested in the stock market, the professionals pulled back, because they believed ordinary people buy at the top.
But today, the huge inflows into stocks via mutual funds are widely considered to be a prime impetus behind the rising market, the idea being that demographic demand for equities pushes up prices. As more Americans have to make their own decisions about investing their pensions, they have been inundated with studies showing that stocks are always the best investments in the long run.
"That has been true for the last 15 years, so why not believe it?" asked Robert J. Farrell, senior investment adviser at Merrill Lynch. "Except that one day it won't be true, because the market goes from one extreme to another."
Eventually, he said, returns are not going to match the average investor's expectations, and when that happens, the consequences could be severe. "I'm afraid people are going to be disappointed."
Old market hands like Barton M. Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, like to point out that no market goes up forever. "It wasn't so long ago that the conventional wisdom was commercial real estate was the way to get rich," he wrote recently, "and you couldn't go wrong buying your home with a big mortgage since prices only went up."
Over the next few years, he has predicted, stocks will return only 4 percent a year, far less than the 14 percent they have averaged in the last five years.
The bull market has been going on at least since 1987 and by most measures since 1982. The value that the stock market puts on America's blue-chip companies, as measured by the Dow industrial index, has doubled since 1991.
None of this means that the stock market is necessarily going to crumble next week or next month or even next year. It has not paid investors to be cautious, much less bearish, in a very long time.
And many seasoned investors, like Lazlo Birinyi, who runs his own research firm in Connecticut, remain bullish. "Though with a small b," he said, adding that he expects the Dow to bounce around between 5,400 and 5,700 this year, which does not leave much room for further gains. Yesterday, the Dow was down 203 points from its high of 5,690 on April 3. According to his figures, the last time the Dow suffered such a steep drop was in March 1994, when the Dow tumbled almost 243 points in a week.
But Mr. Metz of Oppenheimer points out that even pension investors are not forced to keep their money in the stock market. "In the dark age, this money used to go into Guaranteed investment contracts, bond funds and balanced funds," he said.
And it may well do so again if interest rates continue to rise. Right now, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds is 6.93 percent. A 7 percent bond yield is "neutral territory" for stocks, but 7.5 percent is "bearish at this price level," said Eric H. Sorensen, the head of global quantitative research for Salomon Brothers.

HEADLINE: Mixed Signs In Producer Price Index

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
Inflation jitters grew today despite a report that a sizable increase in producer prices in March was confined largely to energy and food.
Contributing to the uneasiness was another rise in the price of oil, as well as increases for grains and metals. There was also a bigger drop than expected in first-time claims for unemployment insurance in the week ended last Saturday. 
 Summing up the mixed evidence, which caused a brief deterioration of the bond market, analysts said reassuring figures for last month did little to offset current price surges.
"Some people think inflation's on the way, even if they didn't get it in this report" from the Labor Department, said Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. He pointed to sharp rises in grain futures prices and another peak for the price index compiled by the Commodity Research Bureau.
The prices paid to producers of finished goods rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month, according to the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than reversing February's two-tenths of 1 percent decline.
But when the volatile energy and food components are put aside, the so-called core Producer Price Index edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent, the fourth consecutive month without significant change.
"Without food and energy, it's clearly and plainly obvious that inflation is well behaved," said Paul A. McCulley, chief economist for UBS Securities in New York.
He added that while food and energy were important items in the economy, it was by no means clear that Federal Reserve policy makers would worry even if these prices rose sharply for some time. Such a rise may just mean that wholesalers or other middlemen have to absorb the extra costs if competition does not permit passing them along.
"The question is, does it put pressure on somebody's margin?" Mr. McCulley said.
Other evidence that inflation remains subdued, at least through March, was a lack of price pressure at earlier stages of production. Core intermediate goods like a bolt of cloth edged down two-tenths of 1 percent last month. With their sixth consecutive decline, they are now below the level of March 1995.
And raw materials other than food and energy fell 1.8 percent last month, continuing a string of declines that began last July, interrupted only by a flat reading in January.
"Inflation fears are probably exaggerated," said Lynn Reaser, a California economist who heads the American Bankers Association's advisory council. She described the bond market as now "plagued by negative sentiment" about inflation, in sharp contrast to the "euphoria" that she said marked much of 1995.
The price of finished energy goods jumped 2.4 percent last month, the department's report showed, with gasoline up 7.1 percent and home heating oil soaring 10.5 percent. Residential natural gas rose 1.4 percent.
Food, a lesser factor, rose six-tenths of 1 percent as vegetables leaped 43.1 percent after a 5.1 percent February decline. Beef and veal prices, however, fell 5.1 percent.
Among intermediate goods, which advanced two-tenths of 1 percent over all, hot rolled steel bars and other durables used in manufacturing fell two-tenths of 1 percent after a February decline of eight-tenths.
An 8.5 percent surge in crude petroleum was a big contributor to a 1.6 percent rise in raw materials.

Meyer Vaisman
303 Gallery
89 Greene Street
SoHo
Through April 20
 I' December 1994, Meyer Vaisman, a Venezuelan artist living in New York, was chosen to represent Venezuela in the 1995 Venice Biennale. But when members of the selection committee saw the installation he intended to exhibit -- a cinder-block shanty enclosing an elegant, wood-paneled dressing room -- the invitation was hastily withdrawn. 
 Mr. Vaisman's installation, titled "Green on the Outside, Red on the Inside," is now on view at 303 Gallery. The cinder-block exterior is unlikely to shock anyone who has ever seen bricked-up tenements in New York City. On the contrary, New Yorkers are more likely to be fascinated by the "modern," 60's-style paneling of the interior, which has by now acquired a distinct retro charm. It comes, in fact, from Mr. Vaisman's childhood residence. The four apertures revealing the interior are framed by casts of human hip bones, as if the implied return to childhood were also a voyage up the birth canal and back into the womb.
The exhibition also includes several pieces in which black beans are displayed on top of cinder blocks, sometimes by themselves, sometimes heaped inside articles of clothing. It appears that these particular beans wer' planted and grown in the formal gardens of the Serralves Foundation, in Portugal, while "Green on the Outside, Red on the Inside" was being exhibited there.
A sympathetic viewer might interpret them as a comment on the trans-Atlantic economy of the colonial era, with its harvest of wealth for the few and mere subsistence for the many. Visually, alas, they remain unimpressive. PEPE KARMEL

HEADLINE: Ford Is Getting Tighter Control Of Its Partner, Mazda Motor

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Friday, April 12

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company agreed today to invest nearly $500 million in the Mazda Motor Corporation in a deal that makes Ford the first American company to take effective control of a Japanese car maker.
Ford, which has held a 25 percent stake in Mazda since 1979, will raise its interest to 33.4 percent, the two companies said today. Ford will buy 52 billion yen, or about $480 million, worth of newly issued Mazda stock. 
 A longtime Ford official, Henry Wallace, who is now at Mazda, will become the president of Mazda on June 27. He is Scottish, which would make him one of the few foreigners ever to run a large Japanese corporation. Ford also said there would be "a modest increase in the number of Ford personnel nominated to Mazda management positions."
Yoshihiro Wada, who is Mazda's president now and and will take the largely ceremonial post of chairman this summer, said Ford and Mazda would work together more closely "while still maintaining each company's separate identity."
The additional investment in Mazda represents in part a defensive effort by Ford to protect the value of its 25 percent stake in the struggling auto maker. Ford also wants to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing East Asian car market.
All of the world's biggest car makers are looking to East Asia for their strongest growth in the coming decade. John F. Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, set a goal in January of capturing 10 percent of that market by the end of 2005.
Ford's board approved the deal on Thursday, and Mazda's board gave its assent today in Japan.
Today's deal marks an extraordinary reversal in the fortunes of American and Japanese auto makers. The five-year recession in Japan has crippled that country's car producers, as plunging sales have ruined their profit margins and deprived the weaker ones like Mazda of the money to develop new models.
At the same time, the strong American economy and vigorous sales have left the American companies in their best financial condition in many years. Detroit has also benefited from the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, two categories in which Japanese auto makers have had trouble coming up with popular designs.
But the American auto makers' prosperity is now threatened by the steady strengthening in currency markets of the dollar against the yen, which has made Japanese cars more competitive in the American market. Ford has been the most worried about the dollar's rise, and today's investment resembles the original Ford purchase of a stake in Mazda, also motivated by worries about Japanese competition. The share of the American market held by Japanese car makers leapt 2 percentage points, to 24.7 percent, in March from March 1995.
[In Tokyo, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry welcomed the deal as good for the world economy.]
Mr. Wallace was the president of Ford of Venezuela when he was named in 1993 to become the executive vice president of Mazda, a title he has held ever since.
During the 1980's, Ford often looked to Mazda for help in designing more attractive cars and improving the efficiency of its manufacturing operations. But as Mazda has run into trouble, its management has been increasingly taking its cues from its bankers and Ford. Ford officials have closely overseen many spending decisions at Mazda since Mr. Wallace's arrival there.
Mazda's troubles stem partly from a weak network of dealers in Japan and partly from its over-investment in new factories and car models in Japan just before the recession. With the exception of the area around its base in Hiroshima, Mazda has struggled to hold a large enough share of the Japanese market to be profitable. Lacking money to invest in new designs, Mazda has become increasingly dependent on Ford technology.
Mazda has also had trouble in the United States. Even the company's Miata sports coupe -- so much a fad in 1990 that people offered up to $10,000 over the retail price for slightly used models -- has faded in popularity in the last two years.
Mazda ranks seventh in the United States in sales of cars and light trucks, and its market share here has been shrinking. The company sold 62,209 vehicles in the first quarter of this year, down 17.4 percent from that period of 1995.
By comparison, Ford sold 948,769 cars and trucks in the first quarter this year, down seven-tenths of 1 percent from the 1995 quarter.
Wall Street analysts praised the move, saying Mazda needed the money and could prove a good investment for Ford. After years of losses, the company may have broken even for the year ended on March 31 and could start turning a profit in the coming months, they said.
"It makes sense for Ford to put more money in the company," said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter in San Francisco. "It is tempting to say it is throwing good money after bad, but it is not" because of Mazda's potential.
Today's Mazda deal could also indirectly help Ford in its efforts to capture a big share of the large and fast-growing Indonesian market. Mazda owns a big stake in Kia, a Korean auto maker that has been unusually successful in Indonesia. Ford also owns a small stake in Kia, and today's closer alliance with Mazda is likely to increase its influence.

From Swamp to Brawny Big City

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

CITY OF THE CENTURY
The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America
By Donald L. Miller
Illustrated. 704 pages. Simon & Schuster. $35.
Carl Sandburg called it the "City of the Big Shoulders." Dreiser dubbed it "a new world" in the making, and William Archer described it as a place that "embraces in its unimaginable amplitude every extreme of splendor and squalor," a place where paradise is just around the corner from hell. It's the city that never goes to bed, the Florence of the West, the "Marseilles of our Mediterranean," a city of stockyards and skyscrapers, boosters and businessmen, reporters and reformers, criminals and con men, the city, in Mark Twain's words, "where they are always rubbing a lamp and fetching up the genii, and contriving and achieving new impossibilities." 
 In his new book, "City of the Century," the historian Donald L. Miller conjures up 19th-century Chicago, tracing its remarkable seven-decade metamorphosis from swamp-ridden trading post to quintessential modern city. Mr. Miller, who teaches history at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., is the author of a 1989 book on the scholar Lewis Mumford, and "City of the Century" -- with its wide-angled look at cultural, social and environmental themes -- owes a considerable debt to Mumford's approach to urban history. It also appears to draw heavily on earlier books like "Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West," by William Cronon, and the many biographies of Louis Sullivan. Once again, we are treated to an examination of the geographical and economic forces that helped propel Chicago to prominence. Once again, we are given an appreciation of the architectural innovations that were made on its streets.
Yet if "City of the Century" breaks little new ground, it still provides a wonderfully readable account of Chicago's early history, "from the first recorded discovery of the site by a missionary and an explorer in the service of France" to the Columbian Exposition of 1893, which marked the culmination of "a civic awakening unparalleled in the history of American cities." Mr. Miller draws freely from impressions of the city set down by novelists like Dreiser, Norris and Sinclair, not to mention a host of lesser-known writers and travelers, and he uses them to give the reader a sense of what it must have been like to live in the Windy City during its formative years.
From time to time, Mr. Miller interrupts his colorful narrative to step back and frame for the reader, a la Mumford, the larger dynamics at work in the growth of Chicago. He underscores the important role that technology played in the city's coming of age: how the railroads, carrying lumber and coal and meat, made the city a vital hub for commerce, and how those railroads came to define the city's relationship with its suburbs. He shows how the invention of the reaping machine led to the domestication of the surrounding countryside, and how the invention of the elevator made the skyscraper a viable solution to expensive urban real estate.
For the most part, however, Mr. Miller tells the story of Chicago through the lives of the larger-than-life hustlers, visionaries, eccentrics, entrepreneurs and pols who built the city upon a wind-swept prairie marsh, and turned it into a colossus of privatism and public works, capitalist ambition and reformist zeal.
There's William Butler Ogden, the city's first Mayor, who envisioned great things for this collection of wood shanties and unpaved roads. There are the meat kings Gustavus Franklin Swift and Philip Danforth Armour, who built empires out of cattle and hogs; and the super-merchants Marshall Field, Aaron Montgomery Ward and Richard Warren Sears, who helped invent America's consumer culture and happily supplied its voracious needs.
Like the city itself, some of the biggest players in Chicago's history were odd hybrid creatures, mercenaries endowed with a vision, dreamers motivated by cupidity and power. The "Cable Czar" of Chicago, Charles Tyson Yerkes, was an ex-convict who won a reputation as the city's "most vilified public figure" for his shameless manipulation of stocks and bonds; he was also the man responsible for fashioning one of the world's greatest urban transportation systems.
Carter Henry Harrison, the city's five-time Mayor, maintained close ties with the head of the city's vice empire and blatantly played the game of patronage politics; he was also a wildly popular leader, whose support of labor earned him the respect of the poor and whose commitment to urban growth won him the backing of business. "He personified in himself," a Chicago paper said of Harrison, "all the restlessness, the energy, the ability, and the ambition which have built the World's Fair city into the greatest metropolis in the Nation."
One of the things that insured Chicago's continued rise, of course, was its amazing resilie'ce, its citizens' refusal to submit to the adversities of nature (swamps, mud, extremes of heat and cold, pollution, disease) or the fickleness of the economy. Indeed, the great fire of 1871, which virtually wiped out the town, became an intrinsic part of its mythology. Within two decades, Chicago had been entirely rebuilt, boasting the country's busiest and most modern downtown and more than a dozen of the tallest buildings ever constructed.
As Mr. Miller writes, "Chicagoans were convinced they had survived a 'iblical test, a terrible but purifying act that had cleared the way for a vast regeneration that would transform their ruined city into the master metropolis of America."

HEADLINE: Minimum-Wage Raise Still Causes Job Loss

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In a 1987 editorial, "Don't Raise the Minimum Wage," you reasoned that "a higher minimum wage would probably price many working poor people out of jobs, since they could not demonstrate the productivity necessary to justify the higher wage." 
 Now your April 5 editorial proclaims, "Boost the Minimum Wage." Your reversal is perplexing because your 1987 job-loss argument remains economically valid today.
Research from Boston University and the University of Wisconsin demonstrates that after a minimum-wage increase, welfare mothers and other low-skilled adults are displaced from the work force by middle-class teen-agers who are lured to jobs by the higher wage.
A more thoughtful policy uses minimum-wage jobs as training for more highly paid positions. Census Bureau data support this policy: People earning the minimum wage a year ago are now paid an average of $6.08 an hour, an increase of $1.83, or twice the President's proposed increase to $5.15. With a higher minimum wage, many of these individuals would have never had the opportunity to join the work force.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Surge as Inflation Fear Ebbs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices staged their biggest rally in nearly 10 months yesterday after economic reports suggested the economy was growing at a pace too slow to cause inflation to accelerate.
"Today's reports reassured people that inflation is still under control," said Jim Fields, who manages $3 billion at Wright Investors' Service in Bridgeport, Conn. "Long-term we're fairly bullish. We could see a 6.3 percent 30-year bond yield by the end of year." 
 Monthly surveys on retail sales, consumer confidence and manufacturing eased concern that inflation would accelerate later this year and buttressed the view that this year's rout may be ending, traders said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 118/32 , to 8927/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.79 percent, from 6.93 percent on Thursday.
The gains were somewhat exaggerated because some traders had bet that the economic data would not lift prices, by selling securities short, traders said.
In a short sale, traders borrow securities and sell them on the bet that prices will fall. If prices fall, traders buy back the bonds at lower prices and pocket the difference. If bonds rise, as they did yesterday, traders may be forced to buy securities or face mounting losses.
"The news was as expected; it wasn't a big surprise," said Steven Saslow, executive managing director at HSBC Securities in New York. "What was a surprise was the price move."
Yesterday's economic reports generally heartened the market.
The Government said consumer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, more than a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent that analysts had expected. But without the volatile categories of food and energy, the index rose three-tenths of 1 percent, in line with forecasts.
"Manufacturers are having difficulty passing along higher prices," said Joseph Bench, who manages $1.5 billion of bonds for Capstone Asset Management in White Plains. "That's the kind of thing that will help the market overcome its inflation concern."
And a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta showed that more Southeastern manufacturers were paying their suppliers lower prices as manufacturing activity in the region continued to contract.
A University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment suggested consumers were less upbeat about their economic prospects. The index fell to 90.8 this month from 93.7 in March, traders said. The survey is released only to subscribers.
The market's concerns about inflation were also somewhat allayed by an article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday about Federal Reserve policy. The article, quoting unidentified sources, said Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, believed concern that the economy was growing too quickly was overblown and that he was unlikely to support raising rates anytime soon.
Falling commodity prices also helped ease worries. Crude oil for May delivery tumbled $1.09, to $24.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Commodity Research Bureau's index fell 0.49 point, to 260.17.
Also, some foreign investors bought Treasury bonds because they offered higher yields than European securities, traders said.
United States 10-year debt now yields 23 basis points more than the 6.43 percent yield on 10-year German bonds, compared with 4 basis points less than the German 10-year bond a week ago. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the corporate bond market, notes of Trump Atlantic City Associates were actively traded, showing strong investor demand. The notes were issued on Thursday to help finance the merger of the Trump Plaza and Trump Taj Mahal casinos in Atlantic City.
The first-mortgage notes, which were priced at par to yield 11.25 percent, were quoted at a price of 102 yesterday afternoon.

HEADLINE: Make Brooklyn a World-Class Seaport

BYLINE: By Jerrold Nadler and Michael R. Long; Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, is a Congressman whose district includes part of Brooklyn. Michael R. Long, a Brooklynite, is chairman of New York's Conservative Party.

 BODY:
The Port of New York and New Jersey has a lemon on its hands. Millions of cubic yards of riverborne mud contaminated by toxins are clogging New York Harbor's channels and docks. Some large ships cannot enter fully loaded and must put part of their cargo on barges first.
Solving this problem is not simple. For years, the Army Corps of Engineers routinely dredged the mud and dumped it in the Atlantic six miles east of the Jersey Shore. That is now against Federal law because the mud harms marine life. 
 Some vessels are going elsewhere, and the seaport's dominance on the East Coast -- and 180,000 jobs -- are at risk.
One proposed alternative is to deposit the silt in Brooklyn in so-called borrow pits -- holes that are dug under the water and capped with clean fill. But this approach is unworkable, because strong currents would eventually erode the caps.
There is a better solution. Engineers call it near-shore disposal. The silt could be deposited behind concrete dikes between existing piers on Brooklyn's partly defunct commercial waterfront. This fill could be used for a major new container port and a park and soccer field for the Sunset Park neighborhood. The port would greatly help restore New York's economy.
New York City became a commercial and financial giant because of its port. But in the 1960's, the Port Authority built on cheap New Jersey land what is now the region's main container port, largely replacing New York's. New Jersey's port is situated at the end of the narrow, treacherous, hard to navigate Kill Van Kull; that port's problems have progressively worsened as ships have gotten bigger.
Shippers are beginning to imitate the airlines by consolidating their operations into hub and feeder systems. A 1995 Port Authority study concluded that eventually the East Coast will have only one such hub (for the largest ships) served by many smaller feeder ports.
Transforming New Jersey's port into a hub would require deepening the Kill Van Kull by blasting through miles of solid rock -- an enormous expense. But the Port Authority warns that if this project isn't undertaken, the region could lose up to 40 percent of its current traffic.
Building the hub in Brooklyn, partly on the new fill, would be far cheaper. The port could be 50 feet deep -- the minimum needed -- since rock is not encountered until 65 feet beneath the water's surface in most places. New Jersey's port could still handle the smaller ships.
Thousands of maritime jobs would be created, warehousing and manufacturing would follow. In addition, the new revenues could finance the recreation sites in Brooklyn.
The near-shore use of silt would be environmentally sound. While the water-soluble toxins harm fish, the low concentrations in the landfill would not hurt people.
Gov. George Pataki has asked Michael Finnegan, his counsel, to cooperate with New Jersey officials to find a solution to the problem. Near-shore disposal for Brooklyn should be high on Mr. Finnegan's agenda.

HEADLINE: A Mall by Any Other NameCan Good Vibes Sell Elvis Busts and Cuban Food?

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

DATELINE: COSTA MESA, Calif.

 BODY:
Shaheen Sadeghi owns a shopping strip here, where he makes a sweet living providing space to hip stores that cater to shoppers in their 20's.
But he is not really in the retail business, Mr. Sadeghi insists. He prefers to call himself a "conceptualist," responsible for controlling the strip's "vibe." 
 Mr. Sadeghi has put together an increasingly successful shopping center, known as The Lab, full of cutting-edge tenants, served up in an atmosphere designed to lure in a generation disenchanted with the cookie-cutter look and feel of just about every suburban mall in the country.
Don't look for Starbucks Coffee here. There will be no softer side of Sears. Mrs. Fields, that ultimate cookie hawker? Woefully out of touch. Those ubiquitous shops selling leather pants, shimmery first-date shirts or dangling earrings, two for $5? No way.
Instead, there are more than a dozen stores offering surf wear, authentic plastic Jesus statues, and college-radio CD's, all enclosed by broken walls, ripped-up carpet and a do-it-yourself community garden.
And above all, Mr. Sadeghi says, don't call The Lab a mall. No, it's an "anti-mall."
And that's the genius behind Mr. Sadeghi's approach. For by aiming at a special age group and marketing to that group's perceived set of esthetic and spending values, he has managed to tap into the most popular form of specialty retailing around today without appearing to do so.
"They call themselves the anti-mall, but that is just really very clever marketing," said Mark J. Schoifet, a spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers in New York. "It has been very important for malls to differentiate themselves, and niche marketing is becoming more and more important in the shopping center business."
Starting with just a handful of stores, Mr. Sadeghi opened his anti-mall three years ago in a former military night goggle factory. It is in the heart of conservative Orange County, just down the road from the South Coast Plaza, an archetype of the luxury shopping center.
The anchor, Urban Outfitters, offers the disaffected uniform of Generation X -- T-shirts meant to be worn a size too small, bowling bags-cum-evening bags, black sunglasses. Tower Records set up a store offering mostly "alternative" music. (Translation: if the band you are looking for can be found in a magazine pull-out card for a record club, you're in the wrong place.)
Now, there are 16 tenants, with more to come. In addition to the better-known Urban Outfitters and Tower, they have more obscure names like Spanish Fly, where jaded shoppers can find ultra-camp plastic Elvis busts and religious-kitsch items, and The Closet, which offers clothing for surfing, skating and snow boarding. There's a comic book store and several small apparel shops. The coffee bar is not a chain, and the restaurant is Cuban.
The anti-mall disdains chrome, skylights and food courts, preferring instead to maintain the warehouse look with exposed steel rods sticking out from the walls and lots of cement. The space is further embellished with paintings and drawings by local artists and ready-made objects, giving it the slightly risque feel of a squatter den.
"We are approaching this from a very purified point of view," said Mr. Sadeghi, 41, whose background is in designing clothing and surf wear, and who says he started The Lab when he realized that there was money to be made in alternatives to the standard shopping mall. He combined his undergraduate degree in business, his studies at the Pratt Institute and work on Seventh Avenue to make it happen. "We like it to have that personal feel," he added. "It's not like a typical mall where everything is real cold and you don't know who owns it."
One wall is covered with odds and ends ranging from oil paintings to antique kitchen equipment, and in the center is an open space called The Living Room, where the kind of furniture found at a garage sale has been set up for shoppers to sit and sip their fruit whips by the light of lamps fashioned from old carburetor filters.
The juxtaposition of a nearby fancy hair salon close to the wall covered with poems and old potato peelers leaves one with the impression that Marcel Duchamp had been enlisted to fix up a Neiman Marcus.
"I just love this building," Mr. Sadeghi said. "It gives us authenticity, because it is so honest. We just don't have that many old buildings around here." (The building dates from the 1950's.)
With its carefully honed rough edges, The Lab is probably best understood not so much as the antithesis of conventional retailing today but as a quintessential example of the latest trends in marketing.
First there is its size. At 40,000 square feet, The Lab fits in with the rise of smaller malls, the fastest-growing segment of the industry. Then, there is its demographic vision. In this age of retail downsizing, retailers are increasingly aiming at specific age and socio-economic groups. Finally, the entertainment angle pulls it all together -- rooms to hang out in, live music concerts, interactive offerings like the garden where shoppers are encouraged to plant seeds so they have a stake in coming back to see how they do.
"Its focus on entertainment is the way the whole industry is going," said John Konarski, the vice president of the National Council of Shopping Centers. "At Bal Harbour, they have entertainment groups, too, only it is string quartets. The music and retail space here simply reflects the age and interest that they are going for."
The Lab doesn't always hit its target of 18- to 30-year-olds, though. Indeed, the anti-mall's mix of hip stores and Cuban food appears to attract a host of teen-agers and a lot of baby boomers tinged with nostalgia for their own lost youth. Middle-aged shoppers in Hillary headbands cruise the strip avidly.
Diane Vanderlip, a 48-year-old psychotherapist, said she was thrilled the other day to find an outfit at half price at the CP Shades store here that she spotted earlier for $185 at Nordstrom's. And the faux-60's atmosphere made it all the better. "I think it is great here," she said. "I feel like I've stepped into a time warp."
Jarond Gibbs, 21, was less enthused. "They have a really good selection of records," Mr. Gibbs said between sips of a hot drink at the Gypsy Den, the coffee house. "But everything else here is kind of stupid. It seems to me like kids come here to be cool and away from their conservative parents."
Which is fine, in Mr. Sadeghi's estimation. Indeed, in today's harsher economic climate, a lot more young people are willing to spend $20 on a plastic Jesus lamp than they are to splurge for a pricey Versace raincoat over at South Coast Plaza.
The formula seems to be working, even if it hasn't been perfected.
Mr. Sadeghi said sales average about $450 a square foot annually, up from about $250 a square foot when it first opened, which would place it well above most successful strip malls. He collects about $2.50 a square foot for rent, which rivals some Los Angeles prices on trendy Robertson Boulevard. Urban Outfitters' manager, Karen Stradinger, said the store here is "about in the middle" in terms of the sales volume in its 20-odd stores nationwide. The stores range from about 12,000 square feet to 2,000 square feet
Still, the small stores have experienced a high turnover rate -- about three stores a year are replaced. "When we first opened, beads were hot," Mr. Sadeghi said. "Now, it's cigars. We need to turn the excitement of the center. We need to keep introducing new products. We don't give them an option."
But The Lab also risks finding itself a victim of its own success. "Whenever you niche market, you narrow your audience," Mr. Konarski said. "You have to make sure not to narrow it down too far."
Indeed, for all Mr. Sadeghi's obsession with his own sense of "authenticity," young adults today are no more unified in their shopping habits than they are in their voting records or their eating patterns.
Plenty of people in their 20's are just as happy with a skirt or tie from Nordstrom's as they are with a fuzzy crop top from Urban Outfitters, which may explain why 43 percent of the anti-mall's shoppers, according to marketing surveys, also frequent South Coast Plaza, the uber-mall down the road.
Further, there is not much within miles of the anti-mall that supports its groovy retail thesis. Down the street is a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant, a gas station and a McDonald's. Little in this sunny, affluent area surrounded by highways suggests that the East Village of Southern California is in the making.
But don't tell that to Mr. Sadeghi, who has harnessed practically the last embodiment of anti-capitalism to his own vision of hip capitalism. "The whole Cuba thing is really happening right now," Mr. Sadeghi said, standing in the doorway of Havana, The Lab's sit-down restaurant. "There is something really good about Cuba. It is the only place that is really vibrant."

HEADLINE: New York City Can't Afford This Tax

BYLINE: By Rebecca Johnson; Rebecca Johnson is a contributing editor for Vogue and Mademoiselle.

 BODY:
Every three months, I make out a check to New York City for, well, never mind the exact number -- suffice to say it's 4 percent of my quarterly earnings.
If you get a paycheck, an annual Christmas party and will send off your annual check to the Internal Revenue Service on Monday, you probably have no idea what I'm talking about. But if you are self-employed and a full- or part-time New York City resident you, too, probably pay 4 percent on top of the taxes everyone else pays. It is called the unincorporated business tax, and it is especially harmful in a city that depends on its freelance writers and artists. 
 Taxes do more than create revenue -- they are also instruments of social engineering. A deduction for mortgage interest encourages people to buy homes, thus boosting the economy. Sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol discourage us from indulging our vices. Cars pollute and create potholes -- thus New York's whopping 14.5 percent sales tax on parking garage fees. Those punitive taxes make sense in a society where smoking, drinking and driving are considered wasteful or bad (especially if done in unison). Freelancing, however, is not a bad thing.
In fact, freelancers are exactly the kinds of people New York should encourage to live here. They are the dancers, actors, writers and musicians who forego the security of a real job, with its perks of health insurance and pension fund, for the freedom to create. They are what helps make New York hum, and it's the hum that attracts the tourists who in turn spend lots of money on the local economy.
A 1994 study by the Manhattan Borough President's office found that New York's share of the national magazine publishing workforce declined by nearly 10 percent between 1977 and 1990 and recommended overhauling the unincorporated business tax.
It's not as if freelancers use more city services than employees. The 10 feet I travel from my bedroom to my office is not covered by a subsidized rail system, so why am I taxed twice?
Very wealthy writers, of course, don't pay the additional tax. They make enough to benefit from the tax breaks of incorporating. Every year, I ask my accountant why I don't incorporate and he gently tells me I don't make enough money to make it worthwhile.
Many politicians have said they want to change the law. In 1994, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani promised relief, but the city's need for revenue took precedence and in the end he only gave a minor tax credit for the purchase and service costs of office equipment. Maybe if I belonged to a strong union, it could bully lawmakers into making significant changes, but I'm a union of one and no politician frets over the freelancer vote.
To be fair, it's not just New York City that penalizes us. So does the Federal tax code. Employers pay half of Social Security and Medicare taxes for their workers, while the self-employed pay the entire 15.3 percent of earnings out of their own pocket. Benefits like health insurance and paid vacations are usually estimated to be as valuable as 30 percent to 40 percent of salary. Those self-employed people who can even afford health insurance can deduct only 25 percent of their premiums.
It's not that I'd rather work for a big company. I'm 30 years old, born at the tail end of the baby boom. My generation read "Death of a Salesman" in high school: I've never expected a company to take care of me. When the company I used to work for referred to us employees as "part of the family," it made my skin crawl. A company is not a family. It's a business. I'm sympathetic to downsized middle-aged managers, but I can't relate to them. Their expectations seem quaint and old-fashioned.
As more people are laid off, many are forced to go into business for themselves. Federal and local tax codes should changed in response to the ways the workplace has changed. These days, the corner office may well be the home office.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rise Slightly; Consumer Prices Up 0.4%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
Retail sales eked out a small gain in March as inflation edged higher, Government figures showed today, indicating that a rebound seen earlier this year may be moderating.
The reports calmed financial markets nervous about higher interest rates by suggesting to many investors that the pace of economic growth was not fast enough to reignite accelerating inflation. 
 Bond prices rose, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.79 percent today from 6.93 percent on Thursday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. Encouraged by bonds, stocks also posted strong gains.
While the data showed a rise in the Consumer Price Index of four-tenths of 1 percent -- higher than expected -- the core, or underlying, rate that excludes food and energy rose three-tenths of 1 percent, matching the market's expectations. The core rate is regarded as a better indication of inflation pressures over the short run than the index as a whole. The rise in the overall index lifted the three-month compound annual rate to 4 percent.
Retail sales, meanwhile, were reported by the Commerce Department to have edged up a scant one-tenth of 1 percent in March. But analysts also pointed to a huge upward revision in February sales, to a 1.9 percent surge instead of the eight-tenths of 1 percent gain that was first estimated. And the figures ran counter to many reports from auto makers and retailers showing strong gains for the month.
The upshot was further consternation among economists.
"Given all the problems the Commerce Department has had in dealing with -- and seasonally adjusting for -- the Government shutdowns, the blizzard and an early Easter, it is still unclear how strong the consumer rebound really is," said Veronika White, an economist with the First Union Bank in Philadelphia.
A separate Commerce Department report today showed that factory and trade inventories edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in February while the inventory-sales ratio -- the length of time it would take to deplete stocks at the current pace -- eased to 1.4 months.
And the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta reported that its index of business activity in its district was in negative territory for the eighth straight month while both prices-paid and prices-received indexes hit record lows.
"The economy's bouncing back from very anemic growth but it's only to 2 percent-type growth," or well within the Federal Reserve's comfort range, contended Mickey D. Levy, economist for Nationsbank Capital Markets in New York. And the latest inflation figures, including yesterday's report covering producers, "suggest it's not a problem yet," Mr. Levy added.
Retail sales last month edged up to $203 billion, mainly reflecting 1.9 percent spurts in receipts for gasoline service stations and for merchants selling furniture and other items for the home.
Service station results were swelled by higher prices as well by increasing numbers of sport utility and other poor-mileage vehicles on the road, analysts said.
Sales were also up by three-tenths of 1 percent at drugstores and by one-tenth of 1 percent at food stores and at restaurants and bars.
But these gains were almost entirely offset by declines of 1.7 percent for merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes; five-tenths of 1 percent at automotive dealers, 1.6 percent at clothing stores and three-tenths of 1 percent at department stores and others selling general merchandise.
The large upward revision for February embraced every category except gasoline service stations, where an unchanged reading became a modest decline.
Among the consumer price components, grocery-store foods, which were unchanged in each of the preceding two months, jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent, with a 6 percent surge for fresh fruits and vegetables accounting for much of the increase.
Transportation prices advanced seven-tenths of 1 percent, with motor fuels climbing 3.6 percent to account for 90 percent of the increase. Used cars, a category that has become so volatile that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York proposes that the department use retail transaction prices instead of wholesale auction prices, climbed eight-tenths of 1 percent in March.
Higher transportation costs also reflected a 4 percent rise in intracity fares that helped to more than offset a 1.9 percent decline in airline fares.
Clothing, another erratic category, climbed six-tenths of 1 percent after a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent in February.
Among the handful of metropolitan areas for which March inflation figures were published today, prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent in New York and Philadelphia and seven-tenths of 1 percent in Chicago and Los Angeles, the report also showed.
New York prices were up 3.5 percent over the latest 12 months compared with 2.8 percent for the country at large.

HEADLINE: Commerce and Diplomacy

 BODY:
Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's choice to succeed Ronald Brown as Commerce Secretary, can be expected to keep American overseas business interests in the forefront of Washington's foreign policy agenda.
The Administration's increased emphasis on trade and investment, championed so energetically by Mr. Brown, clearly makes sense in an era when cold war military rivalry has given way to peaceful international economic competition. But commercialism has costs, and the challenge for Mr. Kantor and Mr. Clinton will be to keep them in mind as the Administration fine-tunes its foreign policy in this election year. Defending human rights, curbing the spread of nuclear weapons and protecting other American diplomatic and military interests must not be subordinated to the pursuit of commercial contracts. 
 Mr. Kantor should shift smoothly to Commerce from his post as United States Trade Representative, where he has effectively defended American trading interests. While he sometimes got less than he advertised in his negotiations with Japan, and on occasion we disagreed with his confrontational tactics, he made the trade office a powerful advocate for American business. Like Mr. Brown, Mr. Kantor has longstanding ties with Mr. Clinton, extensive business and political connections and a knack for making things happen.
As more of a negotiator and dealmaker than salesman, Mr. Kantor may be less inclined than Mr. Brown was to lead delegations of American businessmen in visits to promising foreign markets. American commercial interests were clearly advanced by Mr. Brown's 15 major sales trips abroad. These focused on what the Commerce Department designated as "Big Emerging Markets" -- poor but developing countries like China, India and Indonesia where the idea was to lock up deals for American companies to build aircraft, energy systems and telecommunications networks.
A bit less salesmanship would not be a bad idea. When Mr. Brown brought a delegation of 25 high-powered American executives to India last year, serious American concerns about India's secret nuclear weapons program and its sweeping military repression in Kashmir were neglected as billions of dollars in new contracts were signed. Last fall, with China's human rights situation deteriorating and tensions rising rapidly in the Taiwan Strait, the Commerce Secretary was in Beijing pressing some $20 billion in new aircraft, energy and communications contracts on China's President, Jiang Zemin.
In other areas, like Northern Ireland, the Middle East, South Africa and on that ill-fated final journey to the Balkans, business promotion efforts can usefully support Administration efforts to reinforce diplomacy with economic reconstruction.
It is generally a good idea for the United States Government to put its power and influence to work to help open access to foreign markets and give American business the same kind of help winning contracts that European and Japanese companies get from their governments. Export orders can create high-paying jobs at home, and contracts for overseas production can strengthen American companies against their foreign competitors.
But this commercial diplomacy also creates powerful constituencies for overlooking human rights abuses and winking at dangerous weapons programs. Promoting economic prosperity abroad may be the most effective long-term strategy for encouraging political liberalization and international peace. But in the short run, as the actions of countries like China plainly demonstrate, human rights and peaceful behavior could sometimes benefit from diplomatic and economic pressure.
Commercial diplomacy best serves the United States when it is incorporated into a broader foreign policy framework. That should be Mr. Kantor's goal.

HEADLINE: Mayor Woos Civic Leaders on Stadium Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Even as he insists that no decision has been made on a proposal to build a new stadium for the New York Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun a campaign to rally the city's business leaders behind the idea.
The effort has come as the Mayor acknowledged for the first time yesterday that the city and state might have to come up with significant amounts to pay for roads, mass transit and other improvements around a new stadium. 
 With political opposition to a proposed stadium emerging, the Mayor has turned for support to business executives, particularly real estate developers, who share Mr. Giuliani's belief that the project could generate new economic activity and who, in some cases, stand to benefit.
"He's definitely discussed it with people in the community," Jerry I. Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, one the city's largest developers, said in an interview yesterday. "Judging from my peers in the business community, they're right behind the Mayor and the Governor."
In news conferences all week and on his weekly radio program yesterday, Mr. Giuliani has been pressing his case for building a new home for the Yankees, always careful not to rule out the possibility of remodeling or rebuilding Yankee Stadium in the South Bronx. On radio, he even interviewed the president of the American League, Gene Budig, about the benefits of new stadiums to teams and cities.
A new, multi-use stadium could be the city's largest public works project outside of City Water Tunnel No. 3, the $5.5 billion project to increase the capacity of the city's water supply.
As important allies for any major public development, the business leaders could lend added political weight to Mr. Giuliani's arguments that a new stadium could benefit the city economically, even if it means the Yankees would leave their home in the Bronx after 73 years.
Ever since the consulting firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum recommended that the city and state build the Yankees a new home on the West Side of midtown Manhattan, at a cost of $800 million to $1 billion, Mr. Giuliani has said the project could be financed with little taxpayer money, from revenues generated by increased attendance, luxury boxes, concessions and other amenities. Yesterday, however, he estimated that the city might have to spend $20 million to $40 million in such improvements, although the consultant's report estimated the total cost of improvements would be much higher.
"Our objective here is to hold the taxpayer cost down to a bare minimum," he said in his program on WABC-AM radio, "and then if there is a taxpayer cost, have if not all of it, the vast majority of it invested in infrastructure improvements."
Real estate developers would have strong interests in any project that could revive a neighborhood, near the Jacob Javits Convention Center, that has not seen significant development in recent years.
The area also includes several businesses that could flourish with a new stadium to anchor redevelopment, including the ferry service operated by New York Waterway and the Chelsea Piers, the newly developed sports and entertainment center on the Hudson River between 17th and 23d streets. The heads of both companies, Arthur E. Imperatore and Tom A. Bernstein, respectively, expressed support for a stadium yesterday.
"What comes to my mind is what comes to everyone's mind: Camden Yards," said Mr. Bernstein, who is also a part owner of the Texas Rangers, referring to the new park built for the Baltimore Orioles. "It was a huge spur for everything around it."
Charles Gargano, the State Commissioner of Economic Development, who is heading the state's involvement in the stadium issue, said yesterday that he too had approached business leaders about the plans. "If we don't get them involved," he said, "this will never get done."

HEADLINE: Labor Deals Major's Tories A New Blow In Local Vote

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 12

 BODY:
Trimming the Conservative Party majority to a single seat, the Labor Party scored an unexpectedly large victory in a parliamentary election on Thursday, snatching a seat in the Staffordshire South-East local election.
With 60 percent of the vote, the Labor candidate, Brian Jenkins, 53, swept into a seat long held by the Conservatives. 
 While the Conservative defeat had been widely expected, the dimension of it took politicians here by surprise. The Conservative candidate, Jimmy James, got only 22 percent of the vote, with candidates from 10 other parties sharing the rest, the final count showed.
Prime Minister John Major, whose Conservatives have slipped a long way from the 21-seat edge they won four years ago, is certain to feel increased pressure to call for general elections sooner rather than later, especially with the Labor Party hinting at a vote of confidence in Parliament. A general election must be held by May 1997.
The Labor Party leader, Tony Blair, who is visiting the United States, vowed today to seize any chance to topple the Government.
"Of course, if an opportunity presents itself to remove this Government, then it's not merely an opportunity, it is our duty as the opposition to try and remove them," Mr. Blair said in Washington, where he met President Clinton.
The wide margin of Labor's victory adds another setback to a seemingly unbroken string of political troubles for the Tories, ranging from the Government's handling of the mad cow disease to the party's plummeting popularity. Opinion polls show Conservatives trailing Labor by 30 points, with little relief in sight.
The dimension of disappointment with Mr. Major's Government was evident during a visit on Thursday to Tamworth, a prosperous town of 60,000 in Staffordshire.
This community, about 200 miles north of London, is one of the fastest-growing in the country, with unemployment estimated at only 5 percent, significantly below the national average of 8 to 9 percent.
The parliamentary seat here has been held for years by the Conservative whip, Sir David Lightbown. If anything, Tamworth was considered one place where the "feel good" factor brought on by low unemployment and steady growth was supposed to play in favor of Mr. Major's conservative policies.
Instead a score of people interviewed at random indicated they were ready for change.
"This used to be a conservative town, but I don't think we are popular any longer," said Leslie Tucker, a 48-year-old farmer who was running as a candidate for the ultra-conservative Churchill Party. "I'll be happy if I get 1,000 votes today."
As it happened, Mr. Tucker got only 123 votes. A candidate running for something called the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, which believes in "the opposite of all the other parties," got 506.
"They started to lose their ways, the Tories," said Gordon Charlesworth, 68, a retired mine worker, who stressed his long support for the Conservatives, but made up his mind to vote for Labor. "They have been in power too long. Personally I think they have lost their way on health, crime, taxes -- just about everything.
The defeat was even more painful to the Tories because it came after an intensive monthlong campaign that saw a score of Cabinet ministers and ministers of state going to Staffordshire to lobby for a victory.
It was the 35th consecutive Tory defeat in by-elections since 1989. During those years two Conservative members of Parliament defected to Labor and seven others died. Any further deaths or defections would render Mr. Major's Government a minority one, which might allow it to continue to govern in alliance with others, but would make it far more vulnerable politically.

HEADLINE: Man in the News: Franklin Delano Raines;
Moving From Big Money to Politics

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
When Franklin D. Raines was asked by the Boeing Company to join its board last year, he answered that it would be a great honor -- and that by the way, he had a personal connection to the giant aircraft company: his mother had worked for years cleaning its offices in Seattle.
In a career that has already come a long way -- from a working-class family to a Rhodes Scholarship, a post in the Carter Administration and a lucrative career on Wall Street -- Mr. Raines took another big step today, agreeing to become President Clinton's budget chief. It is a job that puts him at the very center of Washington politics and makes him one of two black Cabinet-level officials in the Clinton Administration. 
 Indeed, he had come so far that President Clinton could not resist a dig at him. Alluding to the fact that Mr. Raines would be giving up a huge salary in the business world to take the $148,400-a-year job as Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Clinton said he would be joining "other successful people who came into this Administration to help save the middle class and when they leave they'll be part of it."
As vice chairman of Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage company, Mr. Raines earned $2.25 million last year.
As budget chief, the 47-year-old Mr. Raines may have to wait for a second Clinton Administration, if there is one, to make much of a mark. Mr. Clinton has already set his broad budget policy, having made a commitment to balance the budget in seven years.
The Administration and Congress are still trying to reach agreement on the current year's budget, but if any deal is to be struck, it will probably be soon. And the Administration has already unveiled its budget for next year, even if it stands no chance of being adopted by the Republican-controlled Congress.
But if his job lasts beyond next January, Mr. Raines is likely to find himself at the center of the process of making the tough choices that the President's broad commitment to balancing the budget entails. And he could find himself a point man in the political rough and tumble as the Administration and Congress fight over what should be cut to try to bring spending in line with revenue.
Mr. Raines served on Mr. Clinton's transition team after the 1992 election and has long been thought to be in line for an Administration job.
He said today that he was looking forward to working with Congress and on "this issue of now that there's an agreement on balancing the budget, what values will that budget embody?"
"That's the most important fiscal issue that's facing the country now," Mr. Raines said, "and I'm happy to be able to have a part in it."
Franklin Delano Raines was born on Jan. 14, 1949, in Seattle, where he said he was instilled with a work ethic and, as his parents' choice of name for him might suggest, a belief that Government could be a powerful source of change and improvement for people.
'It's something I was taught throughout my life, to be something important," Mr. Raines said at the White House ceremony where his appointment was announced today. "You don't grow up with the initials F.D.R. without having some appreciation of the role, and the positive role, that Government can play in the lives of people throughout this nation and throughout the world."
After graduating from high school in Seattle, Mr. Raines attended Harvard College, where he received a B.A. in government. He then spent a year as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in England in 1971 -- three years after Mr. Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar there -- before returning to Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1974.
After working for two years as a lawyer in Seattle, he was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to be associate director of economics and government in the Office of Management and Budget. After President Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980, Mr. Raines went to Wall Street, working in the municipal finance division of Lazard Freres & Company, the investment firm.
He left Lazard in 1991 to become vice chairman of Fannie Mae, a private company created by the Government to help the housing market by packaging and selling home mortgages to investors.
Friends and associates said Mr. Raines has a deep understanding of the role of financial markets in setting economic policy, and in particular of the need to soothe the bond market's fears of inflation -- and thus keeping long-term interest rates down -- by achieving a balanced budget.

HEADLINE: Trade Representative Picked As New Commerce Secretary

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
Moving swiftly to fill a Cabinet vacancy created by the death of Ronald H. Brown, President Clinton today appointed one of his most loyal political strategists, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, to fill out Mr. Brown's term as Commerce Secretary.
"We need to send a clear signal to the rest of America and to the world that we don't intend to miss a beat," Mr. Clinton said this afternoon in the East Room, where he turned what would normally be a little-noted review of American automobile sales in Japan into an election-year promotion of his trade policies. "We've got a strategy. We've got a team. It's working, and we're going forward with it." 
 For the last three years Mr. Kantor, who was Mr. Clinton's campaign chief in 1992, has seized headlines and raised tempers around the world as the combative, short-tempered battering ram of American foreign policy, using extraordinary pressure tactics to force Europe, Japan, Mexico and China to open their markets. Several weeks before the crash that took the life of Mr. Brown and 32 other Americans, he portrayed himself as Mr. Brown's colleague and polar opposite.
"I punch open the holes and Ron runs through them," Mr. Kantor said.
The move to the Commerce Department is a lateral one for Mr. Kantor, who already has the rank of a Cabinet member. But for Mr. Clinton, it keeps one of his canniest campaign strategists at the center of economic policy-making and in a position focused on creating jobs.
In addition, Mr. Kantor is a member of the inner circle, helping to plot the re-election effort at the White House. Mr. Kantor's appointment was an unusually emotional event at the White House today, where the mood has been somber since Mr. Brown's death nine days ago. Mr. Clinton embraced Mr. Kantor in a prolonged bear hug after announcing his appointment.
"As you might imagine," Mr. Clinton noted today, "this has been a profoundly moving and difficult week for all of us in our political family."
Mr. Kantor seems bound to exercise remote control over the trade representative's office. His deputy there, Charlene Barshefsky, will take over as acting trade representative, the President said, when she returns this weekend from China, which appears headed toward a showdown with the United States over trade and the spread of nuclear weapons.
At the same ceremony, Mr. Clinton appointed Franklin D. Raines, vice chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Association, to succeed Alice Rivlin as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the key White House post in forming Federal spending policy.
Mr. Raines, who will become the second black member of the Cabinet -- the other is Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary -- was a staff member in the budget office in the Carter Administration. He is leaving a job that pays $2.25 million to take one that pays about a 20th of that amount, in an Administration at such odds with Congress that it has operated with no budget since September.
Mr. Kantor's name will be submitted to the Senate for confirmation, but that is only a formality. Mr. Brown was killed while Congress was out of session, allowing Mr. Clinton to make a "recess appointment" that requires no Senate approval until the end of this session of Congress, early next year and after the Presidential election. The White House said Mr. Kantor would be serving as Commerce Secretary by the time Mr. Clinton leaves on Sunday for his state visit to Japan.
Today, Mr. Clinton's presumptive opponent, Senator Bob Dole, said he expected no opposition to Mr. Kantor. "He probably will be widely supported on the Republican side," Mr. Dole said in Texas, where he was campaigning. "I've worked with him, found him to be very fair and a good person."
But Mr. Dole also used the moment to attack Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kantor for celebrating the early results of the Administration's automobile agreement with Japan, a chief accomplishment of Mr. Kantor at the trade representative's office.
"President Clinton's declaration of victory on automobile trade with Japan is sad and unfortunate," he said, arguing that the U.S. "still has less than 1 percent of the Japanese market, while Japan has over 25 percent of the U.S. market."
As in all things related to trade, the veracity of Mr. Dole's figures depend on how you measure: While he counted cars made by the three major American automakers and sold in Japan -- which numbered about 58,000 last year -- he did not include cars produced by Japanese makers on American soil and shipped to Japan. That total was 84,763, bringing the total American share of the market to 2 percent, as against 0.5 percent in 1992, the last year of the Bush Administration.
The move across Pennsylvania Avenue to the Commerce Department will be a big one for Mr. Kantor: Currently he runs one of the smallest agencies in Washington, with fewer than 150 employees; on Monday he will take over one of the larger ones, with more than 38,000.
His biggest task will be to keep it from being dismantled, a battle with the Republican Congress that Mr. Brown waged for most of the last year. Many in the department feared that if Mr. Clinton appointed a Washington outsider to the Commerce post the department would be a sitting duck for Republican budget cutters. But Mr. Kantor is a wily player on Capitol Hill.
Today, Mr. Clinton made a strong argument for the centrality of the department's role. "I am determined that we will continue on the work that Ron Brown was engaged in the last day of his life," he said.
The main part of that work, or at least the part for which Mr. Brown has been remembered in the last week -- involves taking American business on the road, from Beijing to Belfast. Mr. Kantor will need little introduction to that work: He has traveled the world in the last three years butting heads with trade ministers. "I thought we ought to give him the chance to be a good cop for a change," Mr. Clinton said today.
Mr. Kantor, by all accounts, did not seek the job he was given today. He seemed content to work on the campaign from the trade representative's office in the Winder Building, where Lincoln used to come to read reports from Civil War battlefields, and that now has become the command center for trade battles around the world. But he said today, "I have never turned down anything this President has asked me to do."

HEADLINE: 55-Nation Conference on Fund-Raising for Bosnia Is Split Over the Serbs

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 12

 BODY:
Representatives of 55 countries began a two-day meeting today intended to raise $1.2 billion more in foreign economic aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina this year. American and European officials disagreed about whether the discredited Bosnian Serb leadership should get any of the money yet.
The Bosnian Serbs, who control 49 percent of the country's territory, refused to attend the conference because the organizers insisted that they sit as part of one delegation representing Bosnia's separate but loosely integrated Muslim-Croatian Federation and the Serbian entity. 
 "We have the intention of extending a hand to everyone, including the Serbs," Carl Bildt, the international civilian coordinator for Bosnia, said today. "We have seats reserved for them, and everyone can see that we are not closing the door to them. Their own leaders are closing the door on them."
But American officials at the conference said that none of the $200 million in United States economic aid pledged to Bosnia this year was intended for Serb-controlled areas.
Using the Serbian name for the Bosnian Serbs' republic, William D. Montgomery, President Clinton's special adviser for Bosnian civilian programs, said: "People don't want to help indicted war criminals stay in power. That's the dilemma on loans to the Republika Srpska."
The Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, has been indicted by an international tribunal for purported war crimes and will be barred from running in elections expected to take place in early September. Mr. Bildt said Dr. Karadzic had personally ordered the Serbian delegates to stay away from the conference.
The World Bank estimates that $5.1 billion will be needed over the next three to four years to help peace take hold in Bosnia, about $3.7 billion in the Muslim-Croatian Federation and $1.4 billion in the Serbian entity.
In December, representatives of 50 countries and 27 organizations raised nearly $600 million for 1996. Most of the same organizations have gathered here now to try to bring the 1996 aid total to $1.8 billion in hopes of getting at least some of Bosnia's shattered economy moving again before 60,000 NATO peacekeepers pull out at the end of the year.
American officials here said today that the United States was not contemplating an increase in the $200 million it has pledged so far, part of a three-year commitment of $600 million for economic reconstruction.
Instead, they argued, the United States should get credit for the contributions it is making in other ways -- an additional $350 million this year to help refugees, provide food supplies, train and run an international police force, organize elections and maintain a peacekeeping operation in the Croatian province of Eastern Slavonia.

Down And Out

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
The upmounting volume of outsourcing in ongoing downsizing circles has Mr. Barton V. fuming. "Where do they get these words?" he asks, referring to "outsourcing" in a letter I have culled from the incoming mail.
Fromculling incoming mail often rewards the fromculler with pathetic glimpses of those who want to hold back the future, or backhold the upcoming, as a fluent user of modern English would almost certainly say. 
 Mr. V. is clearly one of these would-be backholders. He suspects the existence of a secret euphemism factory to which captains of industry resort when they require new ways of downplaying the negative with silly words like "outsourcing."
This is surely paranoid nonsense. American English has always had a genius for gilding the nasty fact. It is a skill that comes naturally to every American with something to sell, which is to say virtually every citizen with a patriotic love of the marketplace.
In undertaker's lingo, for example, people are not permitted to die. They must pass away. This reduces a completely unnerving experience to absurdity by suggesting it is rather like a football maneuver.
It is perfectly natural that American industry should try to make us believe that farming out their jobs to cultures where labor is cheap is nothing more than outsourcing. Does anything sound duller than "outsourcing"?
If you sat for 40 days and 40 nights in a lonely room trying to guess what an outsourcing might be, what are the chances you would see a great tycoon firing the local work force to take advantage of cheap labor in other towns and countries?
No wonder American industry talks of outsourcings and downsizings. If these spades were called spades, fiendish incendiaries might re-ignite the flames of Grandfather Marx against capital's inhuman readiness to maximize profits by squeezing labor, and so forth.
American industry now employs public-relations wizards and psychologists expert in fooling enough of the people all of the time to invent claptrap words like "downsizing" and "outsourcing." Or at least expert enough to persuade their bosses to use such words without rolling on the floor in laughter.
By turning bad economic news into pussycat phenomena like downsizing and outsourcing, American business manages to upplay the positive. The American passion for the preposition, with its numbing effect on the brain, makes downplaying the negative and upplaying the positive easier than it should be.
How? For one thing, by discouraging us, when we hear "downsizing" and "outsourcing," from saying: "Hold it right there, pal. When you say 'downsizing' and 'outsourcing' to me, smile, unless you say it in plain English, the mother tongue, words of one syllable."
How, we might ask these utterers of gobbledygook, does outsourcing differ from insourcing? Is it possible to have upsourcing and downsourcing? Why is industry forever downsizing but never upsizing? What about upsidedownsizing? Rightside upsizing?
Insideoutsourcing?
Yes, we know what the happy consequences of all this preposition alized sizing and sourcing will be one of these days. It will be prosperity for all.
That sweet-smelling, ever-loving prosperity for all is upcoming, coming our way, coming at us, coming to us. Not just upcoming, but atcoming and tocoming. If you are in a pickle, it is incoming. If out in the cruel storm, it is outcoming.
For those at the bottom of the economic ladder, it is downcoming, and when it has downcome all the way and touched these lowly wretches, they will be upgoing.
If you are constantly in and out of the house, in and out of the hospital, work, jail, it will be inandoutcoming. Are your days spent going back and forth, to and from the employment office looking unsuccessfully for a job ? Do not despair. It will be backandforthcoming as well as toandfromcoming.
Ah, that great atcoming, tocoming, upcoming, downcoming, incoming prosperity to be produced by downsizing and outsourcing! Despite what the old song says, it will not be coming round the mountain when it comes. It will be roundcoming whatever obstacle it must circumnavigate.
What's more, after it arrives it will be ongoing.

HEADLINE: Liberian Civilian Hostages Are Trapped in Mortar Attack

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, April 12

 BODY:
Several thousand Liberians held hostage in a barracks here by one of the country's warring militias came under mortar attack today by another faction for the second day. While the fighting continued, a United States evacuation effort focused on pulling out stranded Americans and other foreigners from isolated hiding places here.
Diplomats said they had no way of verifying the number of people trapped in the camp. At the American Embassy a mile and a half away, loud thuds from the shelling could be heard. 
 The attacks occurred late this morning at the Barclay Training Center, a sprawling camp near the center of town that belonged to the former Liberian Army.
Forces of the former rebel leader, Charles Taylor, lobbed mortar shells into the compound, killing several people and wounding many others.
Moussa Ismael, a 46-year-old Lebanese merchant who was rescued from the camp but had to leave his wife and three children behind in captivity, said: "It is better for me to die with my children. I don't care about my money or my property, but please, God, spare their lives."
In an interview with the BBC, Mr. Taylor denied that he had bombed the Barclay Center, but said his men were determined to capture it.
"This is a responsible government, and everything will be done to allow humanitarian agencies to do their work," said Mr. Taylor, who is now a deputy chairman of the bitterly split Council of State. His words provoked hisses from a large crowd of refugees gathered around a short-wave radio at the headquarters of the West African peacekeeping force here.
Refugees who escaped from the camp said hostages had been pulled into the training center by fighters of the Krahn ethnic group who are loyal to D. Roosevelt Johnson, a renegade Government minister.
[Gen. George Joulwan, the NATO commander in Europe and the American general with jurisdiction over West Africa, has ordered the sending of a Marine amphibious group from the Mediterranean to the Liberian coast, a Pentagon official said Friday in Washington.
[Lieut. J. G. Walker, a Navy spokesman, said the group would probably consist of the Guam, a helicopter carrier; the Trenton, an amphibious transport ship, and the Portland, a dock landing ship. The ships were in the Mediterranean on Thursday. He also said two other ships were being sent: the Connolly, a destroyer, and the Big Horn, an oiler.
[The ships will carry 2,000 marines and about 1,500 sailors, Lieutenant Walker said.]
Liberia's seven-year-old civil war exploded anew last Saturday after Mr. Taylor and other Council of State members stepped up efforts to arrest Mr. Johnson on murder charges.
The fighting that ensued has pitted thousands of Krahn against the combined forces of Al Haji G. V. Kromah and Mr. Taylor, whose 1989 invasion of Liberia from the Ivory Coast set off a war that killed well over 150,000.
Neither the local or international authorities have estimated casualty figures from the ferocious combat.
United Nations officials were forced out of their compound in the Mamba Point area of the capital today and were marched by Mr. Taylor's fighters to the American Embassy, where they joined hundreds of others.
Paul Koulen, deputy director of the United Nations development program here, said that in just the short walk to the embassy, he had seen numerous bodies strewn in the streets, some of them with their hands tied behind their backs.
From the air, smoldering fires could be seen above the city and long lines of people wandering the streets in search of food and water. While United States Air Force gunners scanned the ground below, shots were fired in the vicinity of a United States military helicopter that ferried a few foreign journalists from neighboring Sierra Leone, forcing a hasty takeoff.
The United States Ambassador to Liberia, William Milam, said that more than 1,000 people, mostly foreigners, have been evacuated from the country in recent days, and that more were turning up all the time.
"People keep running to us for refuge because we're the only refuge in town, except Ecomog," Mr. Milam said, referring to the West African peacekeepers. "Ecomog has been here for five years and is pretty well known, but the United States has been involved here for 150 years and has always been looked to for stability."
Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed American slaves and has traditionally maintained close ties with the United States.
For many families in Monrovia, life over the last few days, spent in isolated neighborhoods with little news and no prospect of safe movement, has been a harrowing experience.
"We haven't slept since this began," said Dr. Wilhemina Jallah, an American woman of Liberian origin. She and her husband had gathered their five children, aged 6 months to 17 years, in just a few seconds after a radio call came from the American Embassy telling them to show up within 10 minutes at a rendezvous point.
"We were lucky that we could afford a $600 Motorola radio, which is what kept us in touch," she said. It was purchased after the family went through a previous evacuation during fighting in 1990.
In fact, many people here faced wrenching decisions about whether to leave the country at all. Many Liberian parents of children who were born in the United States, and who are hence American citizens, learned that only one guardian would be allowed to travel with American children.
"Most of the people who are in that situation have decided to stay behind all together," said Sorsor Jallah, an engineer who, along with his wife, said he had to console many other Liberians who were unwilling to split their families.
Diplomats said today that there was little sign that the Liberian conflict was moving toward resolution, despite reports of a truce coming out of the talks with a high-level delegation of officials from Ghana, which is representing the Economic Community of West African States.
"Everyone says the other has to make the first move," Ambassador Milam said of the warlords, some of whom he has spoken with over the last two days. "It is extremely frustrating to watch things just continue along this way."
Complicating the situation further, telephone service in Monrovia was cut today as workers who have not eaten for several days abandoned their headquarters. At the American diplomatic compound, food and water needed for the large numbers of people taking refuge on the grounds are running low.
At an embassy annex, an open field not far from the diplomatic compound, as many as 20,000 Liberians remained huddled, exposed to the elements and without basic provisions for the sixth day.
Because of the shortages and increasing insecurity, American officials said they would fly as many helicopter sorties into Monrovia as possible tonight to remove 200 to 300 people awaiting evacuation. As of today, there were 200 to 300 Americans whose whereabouts were known and others who were scattered throughout town. There were also 350 people outside the embassy trying to get in.
Groping for an explanation of the crisis, many Liberians said the war would not end until only one warlord was left standing, or when a foreign force deploys here in large enough numbers to begin a disarmament.
"They say that this whole thing began with an attempt to arrest Johnson, but everyone here knows that that was just a pretext by the warlords to bring their contest into the city," said Ben Asante, one of the refugees here. "Now there are dead bodies everywhere, and a humanitarian crisis is looming. No, it has already begun, and this country appears more than ever to be finished."

HEADLINE: State Dept. Budget Is Vetoed; Clinton Protests Planned Cuts

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
Complaining that the Republican-led Congress was trying to undermine the White House's foreign policy authority, President Clinton today vetoed a $13 billion State Department authorization bill that would have required substantial spending cuts and would have forced Washington to give more political support to Taiwan.
"This legislation contains many unacceptable provisions that would undercut U.S. leadership abroad and damage our ability to assure the future security and prosperity of the American people," Mr. Clinton said in his veto message to Congress. 
 "It would also restrict Presidential authority needed to conduct foreign affairs and to control state secrets, thereby raising serious constitutional concerns."
The veto sets up another major election-year fight between Mr. Clinton and Congressional Republicans, who are already locked in political battles over the 1996 budget, a seven-year plan to balance the Federal budget and tax cuts.
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, the all but certain Republican Presidential nominee, said, "Vetoing the bill shows that, for President Clinton, the era of big government is alive and well."
The House and the Senate passed the bill last month, but both vote margins were well shy of the two-thirds majorities needed to overturn a veto. The White House and Republicans will have to work out a deal when Congress returns on Monday from a two-week recess.
The bill would authorize $6.5 billion in each of the next two years for the State Department and other foreign policy agencies. That annual number would be $500 million less than the 1995 spending level, which was $7 billion, but the bill preserved annual aid to Israel at about $1.5 billion and to Egypt at just over $1 billion. The bill also authorized $426 million to fight the international drug war and $435 million for the Peace Corps.
Led by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Republicans pushed to merge the Agency for International Development, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the United States Information Agency into the State Department.
But in a bow to the White House, which was rejected by the Administration, Congressional Republicans inserted a provision that would allow the President to protect two of the three agencies from elimination.
Mr. Clinton called the spending levels unacceptable, saying they would "adversely affect the operation of overseas posts of the foreign affairs agencies and weaken critical U.S. efforts to promote arms control and nonproliferation, reform international organizations and peacekeeping, streamline public diplomacy and implement sustainable development activities."
Administration officials found a section on relations with Taiwan even more onerous, saying it would further strain relations with China.
The bill would revive the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, under which Washington guaranteed Taiwan the sale of defensive weapons; such a move would supersede the 1982 Shanghai Communique, under which the Reagan Administration promised China to gradually reduce weapons sales to Taiwan.
President Clinton said such a move would threaten "one of the cornerstones" of his China policy.
The Republican lawmakers also included a provision that called for President Lee Teng-Hui of Taiwan to be invited to the United States for a visit "with all appropriate courtesies." Last year, under Republican pressure, Mr. Clinton granted a visa to President Lee for a private visit, an action that incensed China.
The Administration had at least a dozen smaller but no less nettlesome problems with the bill, including a section urging the President not to visit China until there had been a "marked improvement" in human rights in China and Tibet.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Adds to a Week of Gains As a Firm U.S. Economy Is Seen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark and Swiss franc, helped by perceptions that the United States economy remains strong relative to its European rivals.
Economic data released yesterday failed to alter the view of many currency traders that the United States was growing fast enough to keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates. Most European economies, by contrast, are so sluggish that central banks there may be forced to lower rates soon to encourage growth. 
 The dollar rose to an 8-month high against the Swiss franc, and reached a 14-month high against the German mark for the second time in three days. It also set another 26-month high against the yen in Asian trading, before giving back its gains.
"This has been an impressive move for the dollar," said John de Beer, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Company in Boston, who oversees the firm's $2 billion in international bonds.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5035 marks, up from 1.5020 marks on Thursday and at 1.2260 Swiss francs, up from 1.2210 Swiss francs. The dollar was also quoted at 108.55 yen, up from 108.41 yen. The British pound was trading at $1.5140, up from $1.5115.
The gains came at the end of a strong week for the dollar, which has climbed 2.5 percent against the Swiss franc, 1.3 percent against the mark and eight-tenths of 1 percent against the yen since last weekend.
While there have been recent signs of growth in the United States economy, the economies of Germany and Switzerland have, by contrast, appeared sluggish.
The president of the German central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, told a group of Swiss and German business executives in Zurich yesterday that the German central bank would consider cutting rates in "coming weeks and months." But that would happen only "in the proper environment," he said.
Those remarks and similar recent comments by central bank officials have bolstered investors' hopes for a cut in German rates that would buoy the dollar.
"We can count on further easing in Germany," said John Trammell, international fund manager at the A. Gary Shilling Company, an investment firm.

HEADLINE: Top Editor Will Leave Magazine

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
Andrew Sullivan, the editor of The New Republic, announced yesterday that he would step down from his post at the end of May.
Mr. Sullivan, who has edited the magazine since October 1991, said that he wanted to concentrate on writing, and that he had signed a contract with Alfred A. Knopf to deliver a book on friendship. He will continue to write for the magazine as a senior editor. 
 "This will be my 250th issue next week," Mr. Sullivan said. "I've done it longer, continuously, than either of my predecessors, and it just seemed right. I think you should stop talking before they start looking at their watches."
Mr. Sullivan said he was infected with the virus that causes AIDS but was not stepping down for health reasons. "I am not quitting because I am sick," he said. "I am quitting because I am healthy. I'm very early on in the disease, and I intend to survive it."
He added: "Inevitably, you view the world in a very different way when something like this happens. You don't want to tread water."
Martin Peretz, the editor in chief and chairman of the magazine, said that he had made no move to pick a successor yet. "There are a couple of obvious candidates in-house, although I won't say who they are, and I suspect there will be some volunteers from the outside," he said.
When Mr. Sullivan was named to succeed Hendrik Hertzberg as editor of the magazine, a journal of politics and the arts, the choice represented not only a generational shift but also a cultural one. Only 28 at the time, Mr. Sullivan was British, a practicing Roman Catholic and openly homosexual. Politically, he was a Thatcherite conservative, with a genuine enthusiasm for American culture. A graduate of Oxford University, he holds a master's degree in public administration and a doctorate in political science from Harvard University.
Under Mr. Sullivan, The New Republic devoted more attention to popular culture, religion and gay issues while continuing to cover American politics, foreign affairs and economics. During the 1992 Presidential campaign, the magazine was an early and persistent champion of Bill Clinton, whom it celebrated in one early cover article as "The Anointed." The honeymoon ended soon after Mr. Clinton was elected.
Mr. Sullivan said: "I wanted to expand the variety of subjects and to develop more the magazine's argumentative and tempestuous self. I wanted to stir it up." He compared the magazine to a dinner party made up of cantankerous guests.
Critics of the magazine complained that the Sullivan era of diversity and his oft-proclaimed "post-ideological" point of view made the magazine blurry and confused. Admirers praised him for infusing new blood while preserving the magazine's reputation for being independent-minded.
"Andrew gave it a more consciously hip tone, but he was very good at keeping the serious side of the magazine serious," said Michael Kelly, the Washington editor of The New Yorker and a former contributor to The New Republic. "He kept the magazine intellectually honest, tough minded and free of cant."
Mr. Sullivan said that part of his mission had been to bring in younger writers. "I looked around the table at an editorial meeting the other day and the average age was around 30," he said. One of those younger writers was Ruth Shalit, whose reporting has repeatedly been attacked as inaccurate and on a few occasions as containing plagiarized material. Ms. Shalit is on a leave of absence from the magazine.
Mr. Sullivan wrote often on sexual politics and gay issues, and he argued strongly in favor of gay marriage and against the Catholic Church's doctrine on homosexuality. He developed his views at greater length in "Virtually Normal: An Argument About Homosexuality," which was published last year by Knopf.
Mr. Sullivan's unusual blending of political conservatism and social liberalism made him an unpredictable voice on homosexual issues, however. He brought down on his head the wrath of many gay critics after he criticized the practice of outing, or identifying by name actors, politicians and other public figures who were keeping their homosexuality secret.
During Mr. Sullivan's tenure, the circulation of the magazine increased from 96,000 to 100,000 and advertising revenues rose 76 percent. The New Republic won National Magazine Awards in reporting and general excellence in 1992. Adweek magazine named Mr. Sullivan editor of the year for 1996.
"He brought us new readers by focusing on certain kinds of cultural issues," Mr. Peretz said. "He probably lost us some readers who thought those interests compromised our authority as a guide to how you think politically."

HEADLINE: Ford, in Mazda Investment, Is Revered as Well as Feared

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company's decision to take effective control of the Mazda Motor Corporation represents a judgment that the ailing Japanese car maker, with its sales falling, can no longer make it by itself in an increasingly global and combative auto industry, executives and analysts said yesterday.
"They are a small company and today's world is getting very competitive," Wayne Booker, executive vice president of Ford, said at a news conference in Dearborn, Mich. 
 But in Japan, the effective takeover of a leading company in a core industry by an American company was greeted with some of the same sense of letdown and concern with which many Americans initially viewed the Sony Corporation's purchase of a Hollywood studio.
A decade ago, American auto makers were struggling to emulate the Japanese. But now, Henry D.G. Wallace, a longtime Ford executive who cannot speak Japanese, will become the new president of Mazda. Most big Japanese companies do not have a single foreigner on their boards and a foreign president is virtually unprecedented.
Only a few weeks ago, one Mazda manager insisted that Mr. Wallace, who is Scottish, would never become president because it would mean a loss of face and morale within Mazda. Mr. Wallace, who was dispatched from Ford in 1993 to be an executive vice president at Mazda, was already effectively in control of the company, he said.
Under the agreement announced yesterday, Ford will give Mazda a much-needed capital injection of 52 billion yen, or about $480 million. That will increase Ford's stake in Mazda from the roughly 25 percent it has held since 1979 to 33.4 percent, a level that gives it effective control under Japanese law.
Ford will pay 363 yen for each of the newly issued Mazda shares, well below Mazda's closing price of 465 yen on Thursday; Mazda's shares did not trade yesterday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Ford's new stake in Mazda is not completely unprecedented. The General Motors Corporation owns an even larger 37 percent of Tokyo-based Isuzu Motors Ltd. G.M. has also stationed its executives at the Japanese truck manufacturer in posts as high as executive vice president. But G.M. never tried to exercise the hands-on control that Ford has with Mazda.
Workers at Mazda and people in Hiroshima, where the company is based and is a mainstay of the economy, had mixed feelings. Some hoped Ford would revive Mazda, while others worried that American management would end the practice of lifetime employment.
"That's what the young workers are talking about -- tomorrow you will be fired," one young manager in Hiroshima said. "This kind of joke has been going around since the announcement."
But Mr. Booker of Ford said yesterday that he did not anticipate any major cuts in Mazda's employment.
In Tokyo, Mr. Wallace said at a news conference that his priority was "first and foremost to establish and maintain a very strong corporate identity for Mazda worldwide." Mr. Wallace -- who has insisted that he is an employee of Mazda, not Ford -- said the image of a company is not based upon "who the shareholders are and who the component makers are."
Ford is now expected to integrate Mazda more fully into its global operations. For instance, Ford can turn to Mazda for product design, especially for the fast-growing Asian market.
"They are very nimble," Mr. Booker said. "They can develop products very quickly. They have a good knowledge of what Asian customers want."
He said Ford would "quite likely" sell its own cars through Mazda dealers in Japan, where American auto makers have faced difficulties in signing up dealers.
To get any value out of Mazda, however, Ford had to save it, analysts said. "It wouldn't have gone bankrupt, but it would have just gotten smaller," said Saul Rubin of SBC Warburg in Tokyo. "With Ford behind it, I think it can regain its competitiveness."
To some extent, Mazda is already on the mend. Even though the company posted net losses totaling 80 billion yen, or roughly $800 million, in the fiscal years 1993 and 1994, Mazda expects to have reached the break-even point in its fiscal year that ended last month.
But that improvement comes mainly from severe cost-cutting, not better sales. The company slashed investment in new plants and equipment in 1995 to less than 20 percent of its level in 1992.
"They cannot continue to reduce investment forever," said Chikao Masuzawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. "They have to refurbish their factories at some time."
Meanwhile, Mazda's production of vehicles in Japan plunged 21 percent in 1995 from a year earlier, as both its domestic sales and exports dropped sharply. From 1990 to 1995, sales by Mazda in Japan fell 40 percent and its exports 48 percent. In the United States, its sales in the first quarter of this year are down 17.4 percent from the corresponding period last year.
The recent problems of Mazda stem from its vast expansion in models and dealers during the Japanese boom of the late 1980's. When the economy slumped, Mazda was left with excess capacity and costs. Mazda has relatively limited production outside of Japan, making it more vulnerable than many of its Japanese competitors to the adverse effects of a stronger yen.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Offers Yankees Stadium Plans

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 12

 BODY:
The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority has given the New York Yankees' principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, plans for a stadium in New Jersey to house the team after the lease for its current home in the Bronx expires in 2002, according to officials of the state and the Yankees organization.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said this week that she did not know the details of talks between the state and the Yankees. But other senior state officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the state had offered Mr. Steinbrenner a number of "concepts" for an old-fashioned baseball-only stadium that would hold 50,000 to 55,000 people. 
 Although Mrs. Whitman said the plans were not a formal proposal, the team's executive vice president, David W. Sussman, said New Jersey officials "presented a specific plan" late last year. "The only one from the Yankees who has the authority to discuss it is George Steinbrenner," Mr. Sussman said. "George has been dealing directly and exclusively with the people in New Jersey."
But Mr. Steinbrenner is refusing to comment on his discussions with New Jersey officials. He did not return telephone calls to his office over the last two days.
The New Jersey proposal is part of a delicate, four-way dance involving Mr. Steinbrenner, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Bronx political leaders and officials in New Jersey. Mr. Steinbrenner has made it clear that he is dissatisfied with the team's 73-year-old home in the Bronx and that he would welcome proposals for a new stadium either in New Jersey or elsewhere in New York City.
Until now, neither New Jersey officials nor the Mayor have wanted to be the first to suggest that the team should leave the Bronx.
But in recent weeks, Mayor Giuliani has become much more aggressive in promoting the idea that a new stadium be built on the West Side of Manhattan. In the last few days he has begun a campaign to rally business leaders behind the West Side plan. [Page 26.]
Meanwhile, New Jersey officials quietly gave their plan to Mr. Steinbrenner, all the while continuing to profess in public that nothing official had been offered.
During the Yankees' home opener this week, Mr. Steinbrenner was joined in his executive suite at the stadium by the chief executive of New Jersey's Sports Authority, Robert E. Mulcahy 3d; the authority's chairman, Michael D. Francis, and is past chairman, Jon F. Hanson.
"I have no comment on talks," Mr. Mulcahy said when asked if the group discussed the possibility of the Yankees moving to New Jersey. As for the state's proposal, he said, "There is no hard and fast plan." That night, Mr. Steinbrenner went to Gracie Mansion for a private talk with the Mayor.
The conceptual plans that New Jersey presented to the Yankees include three or four sites in northern New Jersey, officials familiar with the plans said. The cost would be about $400 million to $500 million, depending on the specific plan. The price would vary largely due to environmental factors, since some of the proposed sites have significant wetlands and potential traffic problems that would have to be addressed.
Although New Jersey has not undertaken the significant cost analysis that New York City recently completed, the estimated costs are about 50 percent less than the estimates for New York City's plan to build a giant dual-purpose sports stadium on Manhattan's West Side.
The Meadowlands complex in East Rutherford is already home to two professional football teams that once were based in New York, and New Jersey baseball fans have longed for a team for years. In 1987, when state proponents of baseball tried to attract a team by getting the authority to build a stadium near the Meadowlands, voters rejected a $185 million taxpayer bond that would have financed construction. Since Governor Whitman came into office over two years ago, she has insisted that the state would not use tax dollars to build a stadium.
"We have always had an interest in bringing baseball to New Jersey," Mr. Mulcahy said. "But we have to do it within the confines of Governor Whitman's parameters." State officials have since said they could still issue bonds for a new stadium and pay them off with a percentage of ticket sales and other receipts.
Surveys have shown that an estimated 60 percent of the Yankees' attendance comes from New Jersey and Westchester County. And while the team has never had more than 2.7 million fans a season during its 73 years at Yankee Stadium, New Jersey officials project that a site in the Meadowlands, for example, could boost attendance to 3 million a year.
Officials close to Mr. Steinbrenner noted that the team owner might be patronizing the New Jersey officials only to gain leverage in his talks with New York City. But as one of Mr. Steinbrenner's close friends, who would only speak on condition of anonymity, said: "I know him well enough to know that's not what he's doing. I think he wants to get a new ballpark, period."
Mr. Giuliani, on the other hand, is publicly using the threat of a Yankee exodus to New Jersey to create a sense of urgency and convince New Yorkers of the merits of his own stadium plan. A senior official in the mayor's office said he had not seen any proposals from New Jersey.
Mr. Steinbrenner has told New Jersey officials that he prefers the type of natural grass, open-air stadium that they are proposing over New York's plan, which calls for a multi-purpose, domed stadium with artificial turf.
The New York proposal might be the city's last hope for saving the team, since Mr. Steinbrenner has rejected all offers by New York for improvements to the current Yankee Stadium. And the $1 billion West Side site envisioned by Mr. Giuliani is considered by many stadium finance experts to be far too costly to work economically -- for either the city or Mr. Steinbrenner.
New Jersey officials said that Mr. Steinbrenner might be allowing New York to make its best effort, and should that fail he would then be able to make it clear to the public that New York City's space and economic constraints have left him with no other choice than to move the team out of the city.
Mrs. Whitman, who ultimately must approve any formal proposal from the Sports Authority, said she does not want to become part of a bidding war, allowing the state to be used as a negotiating tool for Mr. Steinbrenner.
By not making what she called a "formal proposal," even though the sports authority has given Mr. Steinbrenner conceptual plans, the governor may be trying to have things both ways.
When asked about the stadium plans during a news conference on Thursday, her comments underscored her administration's approach on the matter. "We're not going to get in a bidding war with someone else," Mrs. Whitman said. "It doesn't help to have New York to spend more to keep the Yankees where they are." Then, she added, "If the Yankees are interested in moving, the sports authority has put a proposal out."

HEADLINE: Spring Tonic in a Surge of Income Tax Refunds

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
An early surge in income tax refunds is giving Americans billions of extra dollars to spend this spring, which helps to explain the revival in the economy now in progress.
The tax refunds, $52.1 billion through the end of March, are turning out to be a shot in the arm for the economy; indeed, the latest of several temporary shots in the arm that may well make the second quarter, just getting started, the strongest period of growth this year. "The refunds are definitely showing up as car down payments," Wynn Van Bussman, an economist at the Chrysler Corporation, said, "and that is stimulating sales." 
 The tax refunds, along with several other special effects, could lift economic growth in the second quarter to an annual rate of 3 percent or so, according to some forecasters, including those at the President's Council of Economic Advisers. But as these booster shots wear off by mid-summer, economic growth will probably scale back, closer to a 2 percent rate.
"The odds of a spurt in activity later this year are not that high," said Joel Prakken, a partner at Lawrence H. Meyer & Associates, an economic consulting firm in St. Louis.
The boosters come from several sources. Apart from the tax refunds, warmer weather has removed an obstacle to the shopping and construction that snowstorms and floods had postponed in the first quarter. Auto manufacturers raised production quotas for April to make up for lost days during the General Motors strike last month. And the drop in interest rates that lasted through 1995, bringing down mortgage and auto loan rates, is still helping the economy, economists say, with many Americans making purchases on credit before borrowing gets too costly again. Interest rates began to creep back up in January.
The surge in tax refunds became evident in data made available by the Internal Revenue Service this week. During March, the number of refund checks authorized by the I.R.S. rose to 41.6 billion from 17 billion on March 1, and the total amount of those checks jumped to $52.1 billion from $24.2 billion at the end of February. The dollar total represented a rise of 25 percent compared with the first three months of last year, when tax refunds were delayed.
But even discounting for last year's delays, the refunds are up by more than 10 percent, or roughly double the normal rise of 5 or 6 percent a year. "Unequivocally, more tax refunds are flowing into the economy than is normal," said William Dudley, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Through March, the average refund check was $1,252, up 16.4 percent from last year's first-quarter average of $1,076. The increase was larger than in any previous first quarter in this decade, but I.R.S. and Treasury Department officials said the average would taper off as more refunds were issued.
The jump in refunds reflects, in part, unusual delays last year, when the I.R.S. held up checks to screen returns for fraud in claiming money under the earned-income tax credit. The returns were also checked for inaccurate Social Security numbers. "Most of the people caught in the Social Security screen have been careful not to repeat that mistake this year," said Steven Pyrek, an I.R.S. spokesman.
But the higher refunds also reflect a rise in payments that the working poor receive under the earned-income tax credit, the revenue service said. By law, the maximum credit rose to $3,110 last year from $2,528 in 1994, and last year's money is going out now through tax refund checks. Many wealthy taxpayers, who were hit with higher tax rates starting in 1993, may also have withheld from last year's paychecks more than they actually owed in taxes, prompted to do so by stiffer penalties for failing to withhold enough.
Still, by December, I.R.S. officials said, tax refunds should be more in line with what happened in 1995, when they totaled $93.4 billion, sent out to 79.3 million taxpayers in checks averaging $1,178.

DOCUMENTS FILED WITH S.E.C. FOR REFINANCING

 BODY:
Apple Computer, struggling to avoid a financial crisis, announced one step yesterday that would give it additional breathing room. The company said that it had filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting that it had successfully extended and refinanced $400 million of short-term loans to its subsidiaries in Japan and the Netherlands. The debt included a $187 million note, due in March, and a $203 million note that was due this month. The computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., said that it had extended the loans with new maturity rates ranging from June 28, 1996, to Sept. 29, 1996.

Mickey Kantor Is Named To Head Commerce Agency
President Clinton named Mickey Kantor, who has been the trade representative, to succeed Ronald H. Brown as Commerce Secretary. Mr. Kantor, shown at left, used extraordinary pressure tactics to force Europe, Japan, Mexico and China to open their markets, a style much different from Mr. Brown's.
Mr. Kantor seems bound to exercise remote control over the trade representative's office, where his deputy, Charlene Barshefsky, will take over. Mr. Clinton also named Franklin D. Raines, a Fannie Mae executive, to head the Office of Management and Budget. [Page 1.]
 
Retail Sales Inch Higher
Retail sales eked out a small gain in March and inflation edged higher, Government figures showed. The reports calmed financial markets nervous about higher interest rates. The Consumer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent, but its underlying rate rose three-tenths of 1 percent, matching the market's expectations. Retail sales edged up a scant one-tenth of 1 percent in March. [34.]
 
Mazda Takeover Seen as a Rescue
Ford's decision to take effective control of Mazda represents a judgment that the ailing Japanese car maker can no longer succeed on its own, analysts said. In Japan, the takeover and naming of a Western executive to head the company was met with a sense of letdown. Most Japanese companies, even the most global ones, do not have a single foreigner on their boards, and a foreign president is virtually unprecedented. [35.]
 
Anne Klein Ends Designer Unit
Anne Klein & Company, one of the first American design houses run by a woman that has achieved world-class respectability, plans to end its designer collection division. It has suffered through several seasons of savage reviews and poor sales, and has not been profitable since 1989, according to its parent company, Takihyo of Japan. Anne Klein's lower-end lines will remain in stores. [34.]
 
Editor Steps Down at New Republic
Andrew Sullivan, the editor of The New Republic, plans to step down at the end of May to concentrate on writing. He has just signed a contract with Alfred A. Knopf to deliver a book on friendship, and will continue to write for the magazine as a senior editor. [35.]
 
Stocks Recover Some Ground
Stocks broke out of a weeklong slump to end sharply higher for the day, as a rally in the bond market eased worries about higher interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.52 points, to 5,532.59, and that rise was held back by I.B.M., which fell 6, to 111 1/2. For the week, the Dow fell 2.6 percent. [37.]
 
In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond tumbled to 6.79 percent from 6.93 percent, as investors became less troubled by signs of inflation. [43.]
 
Wheat Surges Again
Wheat futures prices continued to surge as forecasts for a hot, dry summer prompted panicked buying from companies anxious to secure supplies. One wheat analyst said, "What we're seeing is constant buying and virtually no selling." [36.]
 
Profit Skids at Texas Instruments
Profits dropped 29 percent at Texas Instruments, hurt by falling prices for memory chips. The results were far below expectations. [45.]
 
Dollar Up Smartly
The dollar rose to an 8-month high against the Swiss franc and a 14-month high against the German mark. Currency traders said the United States is growing fast enough to keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates, whereas European economies are so sluggish that central banks there may lower rates to spur growth. [36.]
 
New Jersey Offers Yankees a Plan
New Jersey has approached George Steinbrenner with plans for an old-fashioned baseball-only stadium that would hold 50,000 to 55,000 people. The cost would be $400 million to $500 million, about half the projected cost of the plan for a dual-purpose stadium proposed by New York City. [23.]

 CORRECTION:
An entry in the Business Digest on April 13, referring to an article about Anne Klein & Company's decision to end the designer collection division, misidentified the owner of Anne Klein. It is Takihyo Inc., a privately held company based in the United States, not the Takihyo Company, a publicly traded Japanese company; the two companies are not affiliated.

Where Johnson Ends and McNamara Begins

BYLINE: By Neil Sheehan 

 BODY:
In Robert S. McNamara there has been a unique meeting of a man and his times. In a period of vast social and technological change, with vast domestic and international problems arising from this change, Robert S. McNamara is the managerial type par excellence. He has mastered the technique of the statistical approach, the careful analysis of the available options, the ability to qualify the disparate elements of a complex situation. He also has arrived at a time when the United States is at the height of its power, with crisis after crisis flowing through the operations room of the White House. For two Presidents, eager to make today's multitude of decisions and go on to tomorrow's, McNamara has provided the ready answers.
Yet his managerial prowess alone is not what has made McNamara such an accomplished servant of princes. Other men have shown this quality and it has not brought them the power McNamara wields. He has another quality which has been equally important in his relations with two Presidents. It is his absolute loyalty to his superior. . . . 
 "Why does the President hold McNamara in such high regard?" a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was recently asked. "Because McNamara will be hatchet man for the President on anything the President wants," was the unhesitating reply. "If the President told McNamara to call a press conference and announce that I'd gone berserk this morning and jumped out a window, he might argue, but he'd do it without batting an eye," the officer said, "even though he knew I'd died of a heart attack from overwork." . . .
As the day unfolds between appointments, he slowly works his way through the stacks of documents. By 7:30 or 8 P.M., as the Secretary leaves for home in his black Cadillac limousine, General Pershing would admire the cleanliness of the desk.
Mrs. McNamara says he leaves his work behind him. "He is not a worrier," she said. "Once he makes a decision, it is done and it no longer bothers him." . . .
For his part, McNamara has helped the President to hold the line against the really drastic escalation of the bombing which the generals and their political friends are seeking. For the generals want much more than a few important bridges and airfields. They want to conduct an unrelenting campaign of strategic air interdiction against North Vietnam. They want to demolish or otherwise completely neutralize all of the port facilities at Haiphong, to bomb the air defense command and control centers in the populated areas of Hanoi and Haiphong, to destroy the hydroelectric dams and locks in the Red River delta and cause widespread flooding and crop damage and to make virtually unrestricted attacks on the rail lines and highways close to the Chinese frontier. All of these objectives are still denied them.
McNamara was not, however, arguing for an end to the bombing as the doves desire. A restricted air campaign, with periodic suspensions, has its place in his strategy. His stand against an escalation of the bombing arises as much from his present conviction that the war will be decided on the ground in the South as it does from his lack of faith in the efficacy of air power.
What the doves also forget is that McNamara's managerial skills have made the war much more palatable to the public than it might otherwise have been. McNamara, in fact, removed some of the inhibitions the President might have experienced in undertaking it. He placed a 467,000-man expeditionary corps in South Vietnam for Johnson without the political repercussions of mobilization and, by frequently calculating war production needs with dangerous narrowness, has eased the inflationary impact on the American economy.

An Interview with a Cheerful First Lady

 BODY:
When did you meet the President?
When I was at the university . . . He asked me for a date at breakfast the next morning -- and breakfast turned out to be also about a four-hour drive out into the country in which we discussed everything about each other.
Was it love at first sight?
Not on my part. It was keen interest and excitement. When I say we discussed everything, I mean he told me a great deal about his job -- he was at that time secretary to Congressman [Richard M.] Kleberg from Corpus Christi -- and about his interests and his family. Then he asked me if I would drive with him to meet his mother and father.
On the first date?
Yes. . . .
Now, in Texas terms you really lived in much more sumptuous surroundings than the Johnson family did. How did this strike you at first?
Well, there was nothing in my background that would have taught me to seek the same kind of economic level I had. One rather turned one's back on aiming toward that, because there was always the thought that with hard work and ability you could arrive at just about anywhere you wanted. My father had come up from no economic background to a very solid one, and as for my husband's family, his father had been a rancher, farmer and legislator. . . . And his fortunes had risen and fallen with the depressions and with the slope of the years, and at the time I met Lyndon they were of quite modest means. That to me was obvious and no barrier.

Grady's Gift

BYLINE: By Howell Raines 

 BODY:
GRADY SHOWED UP ONE DAY at our house at 1409 Fifth Avenue West in Birmingham, and by and by she changed the way I saw the world. I was 7 when she came to iron and clean and cook for $18 a week, and she stayed for seven years. . . .
Gradystein Williams Hutchinson (or Grady, as she was called in my family and hers) and I are two people who grew up in the 50's in that vanished world, two people who lived mundane, inconsequential lives while Martin Luther King Jr. and Police Commissioner T. Eugene (Bull) Connor prepared for their epic struggle. For years, Grady and I lived in my memory as child and adult. But now I realize that we were both children -- one white and very young, one black and adolescent; one privileged, one poor. The connection between these two children and their city was this: Grady saw to it that although I was to live in Birmingham for the first 28 years of my life, Birmingham would not live in me. . . . 
 "I always wanted to be more than I was," she says. "I thought if I was given the chance I could be more than I was ever allowed to be." . . .
Among black people in the South, Grady is part of a generation who saw their best chances burned away by the last fiery breaths of segregation. It is difficult for young people of either race today to understand the openness and simplicity of the injustice that was done to this dwindling generation. When you stripped away the Constitutional falderal from Wallace's message, it was this: He was telling Grady's mother, a working parent who paid property, sales and income taxes in Alabama for more than 40 years, that her child could not attend the institutions supported by those taxes.
Even to those of us who lived there, it seems surreal that such a systematic denial of opportunity could have existed for so long. I have encountered the same disbelief in the grown-up children of white sharecroppers when they looked at pictures of the plantations on which they and their families had lived in economic bondage.

Memoirs of a 'Cold Warrior'

BYLINE: By Irving Kristol 

 BODY:
I find it more than a little odd that I -- and others like me -- should be denounced as an "obsessive" anti-Communist and an "incorrigible cold warrior." But, then, I must admit that I find many things odd about the new radicalism in American intellectual and literary circles. I am confused by middle-aged radicals who insist, in one and the same breath, that the present distribution of income is horribly inequitable and that you can't live decently in New York on less than $50,000 a year. I am bewildered by a highbrow left-wing magazine which proudly advertises that it is "cliquish" and "snobbish." I don't comprehend the merger that seems to have taken place between the literary left and cafe society, or the calm assumption that writers are and ought to be "celebrities." 
 There is still a sense, I suppose, in which I can fairly be called a "cold warrior." What I mean is: I believe in individual liberty and representative democracy; I prefer a modified form of capitalism to any other proposed economic system; I am certain Castro is no good model for Latin-American progress; I consider Maoism as detestable as Fascism and not easily distinguishable from it; I do not see that the underdeveloped countries of "the third world" represent any kind of wave of the future, and Che Guevara is not my idea of Robin Hood. But this is a new and different kind of cold war, in another time, for the most part in other places, and involving different ideologies. Looking back on the cold war of the 1950's against Stalinism, I can at moments feel positively nostalgic for the relatively forthright way it posed unambiguous moral issues. No amount of "revisionist" rewriting will affect my view of these moral properties. It was, by every canon I recognize, a just war, and I am pleased to have had a small part in it.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Disabled Access To Inns at Issue

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
DAYS INNS OF AMERICA and the Justice Department are going to court over the Americans With Disabilities Act, signed by President Bush almost six years ago.
The law bars discrimination in many areas -- employment, access to telephones and other communications equipment, rail travel, bus travel, public attractions and public accommodation. Accommodation is the issue in this fight: the Justice Department says that the Days Inn company is not requiring motels bearing its name to meet requirements on safety and access. The corporation says it only franchises Days Inns and thus is not responsible, although it supports fully the letter and spirit of the law. 
 The law said that existing hotels were to eliminate barriers by Jan. 26, 1992 "if readily achievable." Hotels making alterations were required to see that altered areas met the rules on access and safety for the disabled: wheelchair users, the blind, the deaf or other people with an impairment that affects a major life activity. The most recent phase of enforcement covers hotels opened since Jan. 26, 1993. The Days Inn case is the first suit by the Government affecting new construction. The law requires, among other things, that public areas and a specific number of rooms -- depending on the size of the hotel -- be accessible by wheelchair, that a hotel have alarms, telephones and safety devices that are useful to the deaf or the blind, bathroom fixtures that can be used by people who are unable to stand unassisted, and clothes rods and curtain-closing devices that can be reached from a sitting position.
Five new Days Inns -- in Willows, Calif.; Champaign, Ill.; Evansville, Ind.; Hazard, Ky.; and Wall, S.D. -- were identified in the five Government suits filed on Feb. 8. The suits also name the motels' individual architects and general contractors as well as Days Inns of America Inc. and its parent company, HFS Inc. (formerly Hospitality Franchise Systems), which also owns Howard Johnson International, Ramada Franchise Systems, Park Inns International, Super 8 Motels and Villager Franchise Systems, on the ground that they participated in the design and construction of the five motels. The motels must respond to the case this month.
The Government brought the suit, according to John L. Wodatch, chief of the disability-rights section of the Justice Department, after investigating 28 new Days Inns in 17 states over 18 months and finding that all failed to comply with the law. Twenty-three of the motels are negotiating with the department for a resolution; the five others are those named in the suits, and some of them are still negotiating.
HFS denies that it is involved, pointing out that the wording of the law refers to "owners, operators, lessors and lessees" and not franchisers. On Feb. 1, a week before the Justice Department went into Federal court in the five states, the company filed an opposing suit in Federal court in a Texas circuit asking for a ruling that HFS had no responsibility for individual Days Inns' compliance with the law. Jeanne Murphy, vice president and corporation counsel for HFS, said that the company selected the Texas court partly because a previous suit brought there against a franchiser under the disabilities act was dismissed. The Supreme Court would not hear an appeal.
Ms. Murphy said that her company licenses the Days Inn brand name and provides reservation, marketing and other services to franchise holders for a fee. It does not own, operate, lease, manage, design or construct any Days Inn properties. The company's franchise agreement requires that individual motels obey all state and local laws as well as all Federal laws.
When a motel violates a rule in a jurisdiction, she continued, HFS notifies the owners that they are in default under the franchise and that some remedy is required. This would be the case, she said, if a court found any of the five motels in violation of the disabilities act. But officers of the company do not go uninvited to the individual properties, nor do they speak for the owners.
 
 
 
Clients Complained

Mr. Wodatch, describing how the five cases ended up in court, said that the department began its investigation of Days Inns in June 1994 because of a few dozen travelers' complaints, which he said outnumbered the complaints about other chains. Days Inn is the biggest economy chain in the country, with more than 155,000 rooms in 1,700 motels in 49 states.
Mr. Wodatch said that the department was suing HFS on the general grounds that it is an act of discrimination to fail to design and construct places that do not accommodate everyone.
"New construction is the easiest part," he said. "We want them to take a look when they build and then they won't have to worry." A bathroom doorway to accommodate a wheelchair, for example, would need a clear width of 32 inches. This is a no-cost item in the design stage, he said, but widening a doorway in cinderblock construction is another matter.
The department cited all five Days Inns as failing to provide a full range of options, among other problems. "Many travelers with disabilities travel with a companion or caretaker, and need to have two beds," the department said in each case. "While the hotel has guest rooms with two beds, all of the guest rooms designated for use by individuals with disabilities have only one bed."
 
 
 
Between Heavyweights

Four of the five motels charged gave minimal or no response to questions from The Times. The Days Inn in Wall, S.D., is owned by Richard and Karla Hauk, who referred questions to their lawyer, Kim Ruckdaschel-Haley of Lindquist & Vennum in Minneapolis. She described the case as one in which "small businesspeople are casualties of a battle between two heavyweights, the Justice Department and Days Inn."
"The Hauks constructed their hotel in accordance with Days Inn standards," she continued, "had their building plans reviewed and approved by Days Inn prior to construction, and obtained Days Inn approval before opening." She reported that Mr. Hauk said: "We believe in making buildings accessible to the disabled and we thought that we had done just that. Our expectations were that Days Inn, when it set forth standards for the building we could construct and approved of our building, was watching out for whether our hotel was in compliance with Federal laws."
The Hauks were trying to work out modifications with the Justice Department that may cost well into six figures, the lawyer said.
Mr. Hauk said, again through his lawyer: "We feel betrayed and abandoned by both Days Inn, which so far has washed its hands of the matter, and the Justice Department, which seems to be using us to prove a point."
Days Inn will be giving preliminary answers in the courts this month. People with disabilities who wish to make complaints about accommodations may send them to the Department of Justice, Disability Rights Section, Room 7129, 10th and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20530.

Dollar Outlook Brighter After Last Year's Slide

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
WITH the possible exception of the weather, no single variable in planning for international travel is more subject to uncertainty than the value of the dollar. Just consider last year. The dollar was hitting new lows against its Japanese, German and French counterparts in the spring, and it seemed unclear when the slide would end.
Then, in the middle of the summer, the dollar started surging in value, in part because the economic outlook for the United States brightened relative to other big countries. A hotel room in Paris that would have cost $200 a night on July 28, when the dollar bought 4.8 francs, would have cost $188 a night six weeks later, when the exchange rate was 5.1 francs. The difference might not seem like much, but over a seven-night stay, it adds up to $84, hardly pocket change even in a city as expensive as Paris. 
 Of course, movements in the dollar are not always directly translated into changes in travel costs. Currency values are only one of myriad factors that affect air fares, if they affect them at all. Package tours often hold their advertised prices steady even when the dollar is bouncing up or down.
But a strong trend in one direction or another unquestionably filters through to travelers in big ways and small -- and over the past several years the dollar has gyrated substantially against many major currencies.
In the last decade the dollar has lost considerable value almost everywhere. After its tumble early last year, though, it has been strengthening, as the American economy has remained stable. According to the Thomas Cook Group, the world's largest owner of foreign exchange outlets, the dollar had increased 5 percent on average against the major European countries in the 12 months to the end of March. Among the biggest changes was the rebound of the dollar against the Japanese yen. The dollar was worth 83 yen last April; at the end of March it was at 106, a gain of 27 percent. During the same period, the dollar rose in value from 6.79 Mexican pesos to 7.55, a gain of 11 percent.
The question now is what to expect for the rest of this year.
It is a tricky question, given that currency values are subject to a host of economic, political and financial market factors that are hard to anticipate. But, like many analysts, Jim Dibe, the vice president for currency trading at Thomas Cook, said the outlook for the dollar is generally good.
"Overall, the scenario is very supportive of the dollar," he said. "There is low inflation, a fairly good economic outlook and politically not as much uncertainty as a while ago. Therefore most people expect the dollar to continue to gain strength, but not a lot of strength."
Mr. Dibe said his company has projected that over the next year the dollar's value should rise from 5.05 French francs to 5.35; from 1.48 German marks to 1.55, and from 106 Japanese yen to 112. The projections, he said, also call for the American currency to gain against the Mexican, British and Italian.
Mr. Dibe asserted that travelers should not make too much of currency fluctuations. Not only are they unpredictable, but they also rarely if ever make an inexpensive country an expensive one, or vice versa.
"If the value of the dollar goes up 20 percent, Japan and Switzerland are still real expensive," he said. "If an American goes to Mexico, it's a good value, irrespective of what the dollar does."
Moreover, he said, the economies of many countries are "dollarized," especially in the former Soviet bloc and to some extent in Latin America and Israel. That means many prices, especially for tourists, are set officially or unofficially in dollars and do not necessarily move with exchange rates.
"For American travelers going to those countries, the value of the dollar doesn't mean anything," he said.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Deco and Deals In Miami's South Beach

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
RECENTLY I started reading mystery novels set in and around Miami by such writers as Elmore Leonard, Carl Hiaasen and Edna Buchanan -- page-turners full of fecund moons and firearms, Palm Beach palaces and shabby hotels, sad-sack victims and charismatic thugs. I found myself yearning to visit. So in February, I bought a round-trip ticket to Miami on Tower Airlines for $168 and flew south.
It was Elmore Leonard who led me to showy, balmy South Beach, which sits across Biscayne Bay from downtown Miami. In "Stick," Ernest Stickley Jr., a k a Stick, fresh out of prison, rents a room at the Bon-Aire Hotel in South Beach for the admirable rate of $33 a night. I couldn't find a listing for the Bon-Aire in the 1996 Miami Visitors Guide (which I ordered from the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau), so I booked rooms in three other South Beach hotels: the Dorchester on Collins Avenue at $75 for one night, the Surfcomber, also on Collins, for two nights at $75 each and the Park Washington on Washington Avenue for one night at $69. Stick feels curtailed by his lack of wheels, so I reserved an economy Dodge Neon at the airport office of Dollar Rent-a-Car for $22 a day. 
 Picking up the car and finding my way onto the elevated freeways was no problem at all, because Miami has posted sunburst signs that help visitors find tourist areas like the beaches and Coconut Grove and avoid dangerous neighborhoods near downtown. On the way to South Beach, I made a stop downtown at the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau on Brickell Avenue, swept across Biscayne Bay on the MacArthur Causeway, passing cruise ships lined up at the Port of Miami, and then stopped again at the Miami Beach Chamber of Commerce on Meridian Avenue.
Both detours proved beneficial, since they allowed me to collect a "Florida Traveler Lodging Guide," containing a coupon that trimmed the cost of my room at the Surfcomber to $49. I also picked up the "Miami Perfectly Seasoned Savings Booklet," providing two-for-one entrances to a number of Miami tourist sights, like Vizcaya Museum and Gardens and the Bass Museum of Art in South Beach; traveling alone, all I had to do to get the discounts was team up with the person behind me in line at ticket offices.
On Collins Avenue, South Beach's main thoroughfare, the first thing I saw was a Rollerblader in a tiny gold lame bikini; when I leaned out the window to take her picture, she posed -- apparently a basic instinct in the town that has become a backdrop for fashion, movie and television shoots, a showplace for trendy interior design, drag shows, nightclubs and one of Miami's prime attractions (not even counting the big, sandy beach). In fact, the assertively hip community has taken to calling itself SoBe, but this is just the most recent incarnation of a place that has seen it all, and shows it.
Before about 1900 South Beach was a mangrove swamp with alligators as its primary residents, along with a few settlers, who eventually learned that tourists were a better cash crop than coconuts. The first causeway over the bay was completed in 1913, just as hotels started to rise (though never too high). The first architectural wave was in the Mediterranean Revival style of the day, with arches, twisted columns and tile roofs, and the second, after the great hurricane of 1926, was in the International Style, or Art Deco, as we now call it. So frenzied was the pace of construction that by 1936 two new hotels were opening every week, sporting bright color schemes, ribbons of neon lights, eyebrowed windows, ziggurat-crested facades and the occasional porthole. The place was a veritable Busby Berkeley set, but by about 1960 the action in Miami Beach had moved north, leaving low-income South Beach retirees to play pinochle in the shade while the neighborhood devolved into a crime-ridden slum.
Parts of the neighborhood are still seedy; many Art Deco landmarks are boarded up, homeless people sleep on the beach, and in the early morning drunks stumble out of all-night bars on Collins and Washington Avenues. But in the last 20 years or so, many more of the 800 Art Deco buildings in South Beach's one-square-mile historic district have received such lavish and inventive renovations that I suspect they look better than new. By the time the sun strikes their pink, green, yellow and sea-blue facades, pretty people with matching mastiffs come out, followed by tourists speaking Spanish, German and French, drawn not only by the style and sunshine but also by the neighborhood's edginess. The predilection of European and South American tourists for South Beach has influenced the area in subtle and surprising ways -- there are no washcloths in some hotel bathrooms, restaurants often include a service charge on the bill, and topless sunbathing is accepted on the beach.
I stood in line to check into the 94-room Dorchester Hotel behind a French family with two very excited teen-agers. The L-shaped building from 1939 had a well-kept swimming pool, and my third-floor room was comfortably large, with a double bed, rattan chair, television and 30's-style tiled bath. Dingy carpets and an old, ill-equipped kitchenette suggested bygone down-at-the-heel days. Still, the moderately priced Dorchester was in much better condition than some of the budget hotels I checked along Collins Avenue -- Bon-Aire sorts of places with carefully painted Art Deco fronts yielding to threadbare lobbies and depressing $45 rooms where I could imagine Stick playing solitaire.
Happily, the Surfcomber, across the street and a half-block away from the Dorchester, with a seahorse on the white, pink and turquoise facade, was a big step up from these. It is on the beach side of Collins Avenue (and near a good Cuban restaurant called El Viajante, serving a full breakfast and jolting cafe con leche for about $4), its pool lined with cabanas. In the busy lobby I sometimes passed German tour groups getting a lecture from their guide. My third-floor room suited me fine, with two double beds, a sliver of an ocean view and generic motel-style furnishings. But, of course, it was the price I liked the most.
Traveling frugally has turned me into something of an accommodations maven, which is why I would have been perfectly content to do nothing besides cruise hotels in South Beach. They come in every stripe, from the eye-popping Delano (winter rates $200 to $600, $8 for a Kettel One vodka martini at the bar), with a lobby and porte-cochere draped in diaphanous white curtains two stories high, to the Streamline Moderne Marlin (rates $200 to $325), the interior decorated in a style called "island funk," to the pleasant little Brigham Gardens Guesthouse (winter rates $75 to $105), which makes a cameo appearance behind Michelle Pfeiffer in the movie "Up Close and Personal."
Luckily, on my last night in South Beach I got to stay in a hotel with at least a modest sense of style: the Park Washington, in a blocklong enclave of Art Deco hotels run by the same company, all with secretive gardens and a small pool in front, each surrounded by a scalloped concrete wall. The white Park Washington is trimmed in neon green and red, with bird-of-paradise flowers in the cool lime lobby, and two floors of small rooms that make a virtue of 40's-style assembly-line bedroom sets. My room had a double bed, television, refrigerator, canary yellow walls and another pleasing tiled bath.
The hotel is across the street from the chrome-sided 11th Street Diner, where I had an excellent cheeseburger and iced hazelnut decaf for about $8, and the Washington Storage building, erected in 1927 as an off-season repository for rich snowbirds' furs and jewels. Last fall it reopened as a museum devoted to the decorative arts called the Wolfsonian Foundation (admission $7, including an audio tour). There I took in an exhibition featuring modern objets d'art including an elaborate Queen Victoria Diamond Jubilee casket made at the Della Robbia Pottery studio in England during the heyday of the Arts and Crafts Movement and a streamlined Hobart meat slicer (model 410, from 1941) that looks more like sculpture than home appliance.
SUCH lustrous objects have clearly inspired contemporary Florida designers and artists, whose works can be admired (but not easily afforded) in shops like South Beach Style, galleries like the South Florida Art Center and chic restaurants like Yuca that line Lincoln Road, once the Fifth Avenue of Miami Beach. On a sunny afternoon I strolled Lincoln Road, at the north side of the neighborhood, stopping for a take-away lunch of tabouli, grilled vegetable and tomato-and-mozzarella salads (for about $7) at Lyon Freres et Compagnie, before moving on see an exhibit of costumes from Fellini films at the nearby Bass Museum of Art (admission $7). Giulietta Masina's plain gray cape from "La Strada," Marcello Mastroianni's tuxedo from "Ginger and Fred," and the black silk minidress Anita Ekberg wore in "La Dolce Vita" were all there. But when dusk falls on Ocean Drive along the beach, the stylish restaurants openand the preprandial parade begins, museum exhibits pale; South Beach is a Fellini film come to life.
A trendy Ocean Drive restaurant enticed me for dinner one night, but I had more satisfying and economical meals at a colorful Haitian place called Tap Tap on Fifth Street (shrimp in coconut sauce with rice and beans for $12) and at the restaurant on the ground floor of the Impala Hotel on Collins Avenue. Sitting on the front porch there, I ordered a glass of pinot grigio, garlicky sauteed spinach, and eggplant parmesan (for about $25), watching searchlights circle in the night sky.
During the day, sunshine and temperatures in the high 80's never failed, so of course I went to the beach, walking the mobbed sandy strip between Fifth and 15th Streets, running on the boardwalk that stretches into the slower-paced high-rise district north of 21st and eventually putting down a towel far from the crowd at the North Shore Open Space Park between 79th and 87th Streets in northern Miami Beach.
A tour on a bike obtained from South Beach Skate and Bike Rental in Lummus Park, with a lunch stop at Joe's Take Away and Coffee Bar near the channel that separates Miami Beach from Fisher Island (where huge, delicious fried soft-shell crab sandwiches cost $6.25), further deepened my tan -- as did a two-hour round-trip ride (for $12) from the western end of Lincoln Road on one of the water taxis that scoot around the islets in Biscayne Bay.
At Villa Vizcaya just south of downtown (admission is $10), I watched a film crew shoot a commercial featuring a Cadillac parked at the bayfront entrance of the lavishly decorated, 34-room Italian Renaissance-style mansion built in 1916. Later I drove 40 miles southwest of Miami to walk the half-mile long Anhinga Trail in Everglades National Park. There I saw alligators, snakes and great blue herons, striking, exotic creatures all -- but no more so than some I'd seen in South Beach.
 
The bottom line in South Beach
I spent an average of $107 a day while in the Miami area, with $61 going to accommodations.
I flew to Miami in February for $168 round trip on Tower Air, (718) 553-8500 or, outside New York, (800) 348-6937; the ticket was valid for one year from the date of departure and changes were allowed with no penalty (though if fares go up you may be charged the difference).
My economy-class Dodge Neon from Dollar Rent-a-Car, (800) 327-7607, cost $23.39 a day (though a 5 percent American Automobile Association discount brought that down to $22.22). You might not want to rent a car if you stay in South Beach, where parking is a problem (meters charge 25 cents for 30 minutes).
Super Shuttle vans, (305) 871-2000, take visitors between Miami International Airport and South Beach hotels for about $10 a ride.
The water taxi, (305) 467-6677, makes 15 stops in downtown Miami, one on Fisher Island and two on Miami Beach (for stops outside downtown, reservations are required); one-way fare starting from Miami Beach is $7, round trip $12, and an all-day pass $15.

HEADLINE: In Hiring Aliens, Companies Face Hurdles

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN Colin Service Systems in White Plains was recently fined $1.5 million, the largest amount ever imposed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for hiring illegal aliens, the whole subject of immigration, legal and illegal, hit close to home.
Founded in Westchester in 1913, Colin employs 4,000 workers who supply cleaning services to many large companies in Westchester and to hundreds of other businesses in eight states. Colin denied that it knowingly employed illegal aliens. H. Lawrence Colin, president and chief executive officer, said that most of the violations were the result of unintentional mistakes in completing complex paperwork. 
 Difficulties in complying with requirements of the immigration system extend to all businesses large and small.
Westchester companies, especially those with international business, that rely on hiring highly skilled legal immigrants, are also struggling with the arcane and ponderous regulations that pertain to obtaining visas for foreign employees, said Joseph DeGiuseppe Jr., a partner in the White Plains law firm of Bleakley Platt & Schmidt. "Few topics stir as much emotion and controversy as restricting immigration," Mr. DeGiuseppe said, "but bowing down to pressure from special interest groups, Congress is unable to come to terms with the issue."
Adding that legal immigration is crucial to the economy of the United States, Mr. DeGiuseppe said, "specially for those engaged in international business, the need for legal immigration has increased, not decreased."
In his practice, Mr. DeGiuseppe focuses on immigration, labor and employment law. His work with businesses requires him to deal with the complex rules and regulations surrounding the entry of legal immigrant workers to the United States.
"Multinational companies often have to transfer foreign executives to the U.S. on very short notice for various reasons," Mr. DeGiuseppe said. "When a U.S. appliance manufacturer, for instance, a company then known as Hamilton Beach bought Glen Dimplex, a British manufacturer of small appliances, Hamilton Beach wanted to integrate the key executives from the British company in a corporate transfer from England to the U.S."
But first, Mr. DeGiuseppe said, the executives needed working visas, which fall into two categories. "The L-1 is for executives and managers, and the H-1-B is for professionals such as scientists and engineers," he explained, saying that quotas and regulations for legal immigrants coming into the United States are among the most restrictive in the world. "One rule requires that the applicant has to have at least one year of prior experience with the foreign company in the same job before a visa is granted."
Under the current system, international businesses are hampered by their inability to move executives around as needed.
"Just recently, an international transportation company with operations in Westchester bought a British shipping company and wanted to bring a systems analyst, a key executive who helped design the program and was familiar with it, to the U.S. to help the American company integrate the British system with theirs," Mr. DeGiuseppe said. They needed him on board immediately after they bought the company."
Mr. DeGiuseppe said that it was not to be. Why? Because the key British executive did not fit in either the L-1 or the H-1-B category. "Immigration laws today impose so many artificial restrictions that that particular executive could get only a temporary visa, which meant he had to commute between Westchester and London every 60 or 90 days," Mr. DeGiuseppe said.
Unless Congress comes to terms with immigration reform, it will continue to hinder the ability of American businesses to compete globally, Mr. DeGiuseppe argued.
"What will happen, it will become virtually impossible to run an international business from the United States," he said. "The net result? Companies may be forced to move their headquarters out of the country with a loss of jobs and business, which I don't think anybody wants."
As for the argument that American jobs are saved by restricting immigration, Mr. DeGiuseppe disagrees. "The reality is that when highly skilled technical workers are needed we don't have them because we are not training enough of our own. High-technology companies need a skilled work force if they are to survive and prosper, and they are not finding it domestically."
Other countries, like Britain, Canada, Australia and India, and the British colony Hong Kong are producing the best trained high-tech people in the world, Mr. DeGiuseppe said. "Frankly, without the ability to get these workers from abroad, many U.S. companies would be forced to move to other countries," he said. That is the untold story of immigration, Mr. DeGiuseppe said.
"It is not simply a matter of protecting American workers from losing unskilled jobs to illegal aliens that should obsess us," he said. "Rather it's a case of giving U.S. companies who need high-tech employees an immigration policy that is flexible enough for them to continue to do business at home."
Citing the experience of another one of his clients, a high-technology company, Mr. DeGiuseppe said: "They needed computer analysts on staff so they took all the steps companies normally take to find employees. They placed ads in newspapers and journals. They contacted employment agencies. They spent months on it, but in the end they did not get one application from an American citizen."
Yet, immigration is still viewed by most Americans in emotional terms. "They see hordes of illegal aliens cross the Mexican border in the dead of night to steal factory jobs from Americans," Mr. DeGiuseppe said. "And the truth is that the issue of illegal immigration impacts on every corporation and business in the U.S. Every employer has to verify the legality of every employee he hires, which means businesses have the unfair burden of documenting employment eligibility without being able to verify the authenticity of the employee's I.D."
One small, family-owned business in White Plains thought it was doing everything right, Mr. DeGiuseppe said, but a mistake on the forms, cost the business $7,000 in fines, and some of their employees were arrested.
The problem is compounded by the fact that documents are frequently forged or counterfeited.
"What we really need is an employee-verification system that works," Mr. DeGiuseppe said. "A three-year pilot program, a voluntary telephone procedure, is now under way in some states; New York is one of them."
Mr. Colin endorses the idea of a national computerized registry "to give employers a valuable new tool for compliance." He added: "Simplifying and streamlining the verification process would allow us to focus on what we do best: cleaning and maintaining buildings."
Explaining that the registry would incorporate information from the Social Security Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Mr. Colin said: "Then employers could check that the Social Security number provided by the applicant was valid and had been issued to someone authorized to work in this country.
"It's a simpler, more fraud-resistant system, one that would reduce the time, the resources and the paperwork that businesses are now spending time on complying with immigration laws. All an employer would have to do is ask workers one question, 'What is your Social Security number?' "

With the cold war over and Ronald Reagan in the twilight of his life has come a neoconservative nostalgia that attempts to rejigger history to fit ideology. According to this view, the Berlin wall fell and the Soviet bloc collapsed because of one man, Mr. Reagan, and his single-minded battle against the Soviet "evil empire." His military buildup and ideological zeal, it is said, forced the Soviets to abandon their expansionism abroad and repression at home and pushed their economy to the breaking point. 
 The social, political and economic forces that caused the corrosion of the Communist system from within are conveniently ignored. So is the fact that the end of the cold war caught most so-called foreign policy experts -- particularly the zealous anti-Soviet conservatives -- by surprise. And so is Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader whose deep antipathy to nuclear weapons was matched only by Mr. Reagan's, and who accepted the inevitability of German reunification and the demise of the Soviet system.
Jay Winik, a senior scholar at the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs and a true believer in what has come to be known as the Reagan victory school, has added an unconventional twist to the debate. In "On the Brink," he has focused on four Reagan lieutenants -- all of them renegade Democrats -- who he claims "won" the cold war: Jeane Kirkpatrick, the outspoken chief American representative at the United Nations; Richard Perle, an Assistant Secretary of Defense who fought against arms control agreements; Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary of State for inter-American affairs who championed the cause of the anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua; and Max Kampelman, the arms control specialist who led negotiations with the Soviets on nuclear and space arms. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, even Mr. Reagan himself play only bit parts, wandering in and out of the narrative with very little to do.
Everything that went before and after the Reagan Administration, Mr. Winik suggests, was accommodation and weakness. The Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations took the United States to "the brink" of possible nuclear war; the Bush Administration shut out the "counterestablishment" that the four functionaries represented, and they had to sit on the sidelines and watch the forces of history that they had unleashed.
This book does not attempt to offer a coherent, chronological account of the final years of the cold war from a Reaganesque point of view. Rather, it is a chatty -- often disjointed -- collection of stories that attempt to lionize the four former officials as nothing less than great and passionate American heroes.
"They took over at a fearful time when the globe was mercilessly divided between East and West, frequently hovering at the brink, and Soviet power, not democracy, was on the rise," Mr. Winik writes. "In the end, they preserved the West from totalitarianism and aggression and quite literally ushered in a new world, restoring the possibility of freedom and dignity throughout the globe."
"On the Brink" serves, for example, as an apologia for Mr. Abrams. He is described as having been a "na<arrow up>ve and foolish" victim -- certainly not a liar -- when he misled Congress by denying any operational Government involvement in the illegal supplying of the contras and any foreign governmental involvement in providing money to them. The reader is told that he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress not because he was guilty but because the strain was too much for him, his wife, Rachel, and their children. "The legal fees would certainly bankrupt him," Mr. Winik writes. "For his own sanity, and for the health of his family, he had to put an end to it all. In one emotionally charged October day, he and Rachel decided that they had cried and fought too long. Enough, he thought."
The reader also learns a lot about the cooking and eating habits of Reagan Administration bureaucrats, particularly Mr. Perle. To wit, the opening of Chapter 27: "It was a moment Richard Perle savored, the vegetables and dinner ingredients spread out before him in a tantalizing array: crunchy watercress, squeaky leaves of radicchio, slightly chilled mche, a small but delicate goat cheese off to the side. From the sink rose the earthy smells of freshly rinsed lettuce, and all around him lay other intricate ingredients that would become engulfed in the clamor and fray of a busy kitchen, gearing up for a dinner that was only an hour away."
The British served "thick red ham, creamy mousses, cheeses and exotic French pts" at one annual meeting of NATO's nuclear planning group that Mr. Perle attended. "There was also an assortment of salad greens, a concession to the Americans, who seemed to like their vegetables raw."
The reader learns that Dr. Kirkpatrick drinks tea every morning; that Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister, ate "a hearty breakfast" and drank "a cup of thick black coffee" before meeting in the Crimean resort town of Yalta with George McGovern in 1984; that Mr. Abrams nursed the flu with tea and toast; that Mr. Perle brought "kosher salamis, cheese and crackers, canned pt, rich chocolate brownies" to the summit conference in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986; that Les Aspin, the Democratic Congressman from Wisconsin, "was munching reflexively on salted potato chips" while watching the results of the summit meeting on television. It's foreign policy as a picnic.
Kitchen metaphors even make their way into Mr. Winik's analysis. The Middle East, for example, is described as "a pot of water chronically on the verge of boil, always ready to spill over with seething steam."
The book will certainly be devoured by those who believe that the four functionaries have been unfairly criticized by Congress and the news media and deserve to be treated better by history. But readers who want the recipes will be disappointed.

HEADLINE: One Pilot Program's Concerted Effort

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
ISRAEL CRUZ of Bridgeport said one of the saddest days of his life occurred last year when his now 17-year-old daughter Alisha left school before earning her high school diploma.
But Alisha, who dropped out after becoming a parent, is back in school. And so is her 41-year-old father, as a parent volunteer in a new three-city anti-truancy program at the James Curiale School that is being hailed as a model for the state and even the nation. 
 "It was completely devastating to me when my daughter stopped going to school because I grew up in one of the worst streets in the South Bronx, and the only thing that kept me out of trouble was going to school," said Mr. Cruz. "I had to get involved in this program because after convincing Alisha to go back I felt it was important to help other kids too."
After being implemented last year as a pilot program at the Longfellow School in Bridgeport, in the city's West End, the new program helped attendance rise to more than 94 percent from 88 percent, the best of all 38 schools in the state's second-largest city, school officials said.
"If we were able to make it work at Longfellow, believe me, they can make it work anywhere in the world," said the school's principal, Jetti Tisdale. She said 90 percent of her pupils come from homes whose single parents are now making a real effort to get their children to school every day.
"We had a day in which it snowed throughout the morning, which in the past would have meant a large absentee rate," said Ms. Tisdale. "But this time we had only 15 kids out of school. That means the program is working. These kids now want to go to school."
The program, which stresses strong parental and community involvement to reach out to chronic truants in kindergarten through fifth grade, will involve Bridgeport, Stamford and Norwalk over the next 18 months.
The Regency Truancy Prevention Project, supported by a $50,000 grant by the Fairfield County Community Foundation and administered by Action for Bridgeport Community Development, has been launched at a time when Gov. John G. Rowland has become increasing impatient with the state's dropout rates and its 10.4 percent truancy rate.
During his recent State of the State Address, Mr. Rowland proposed cutting off welfare benefits to parents who keep their children out of school.
But educators feel punitive measures can only go so far to cure a problem with a multitude of causes including:
* Single-parent households where parents are not aware their children are skipping school.
* Families that keep their children out of school to do errands and babysit for younger children while the parent works.
* A quick economic fix like drug dealing that students may see as the only way to escape poverty.
* Poor self-esteem; pupils avoiding school out of fear they cannot do the work.
School officials hope their new program will help turn things around by addressing these and other issues.
At the heart of the program are trained teams of school staff and volunteer parents who keep tabs on chronic truants and follow up with phone calls, home visits and positive reinforcement to get students to return to school.
Having other students cheer and congratulate those returning to the classroom, as well as encouraging parents and their children to attend extracurricular events like basketball games are all part of the positive reinforcement efforts.
"We'll do whatever it takes to get them back in school and keep them there," said Mr. Cruz, who does his volunteer work at the James Curiale Elementary School in Bridgeport, the city's second school to take part in the effort. "We'll call them every day, we'll talk to the students and their parents, and somehow get the message across how important it is to go to school every day."
That was the message Mr. Cruz successfully delivered recently to his own daughter.
"I just hope I can help other kids in the same situation not to make that mistake that my daughter almost made," said Mr. Cruz, whose 14-year-old son Carlos attends Curiale School and wants to run for class president.
Esther Williams-Montambo, the school's home-school coordinator, said there are many reasons why it is important to keep youngsters in school, including safety.
"A few years ago a little girl was murdered in Bridgeport during the time she was supposed to be in school," Ms. Williams-Montambo said. "We don't want to see that to ever happen again, and this program is one of the ways to prevent that."
Michael Hanna, principal of the Curiale School, said: "We're hoping for the same kinds of results that they had at Longfellow and I expect that will happen because of the heavy influence of committed parents participating here."
School officials, aiming to convince students that their best hope is to stay in school, are trying to get the message across that chronic truancy in the early grades can have a negative impact throughout life.
"Attendance problems are usually a very good predictor of academic problems later on and dropping out," said James A. Connelly, Superintendent of Schools in Bridgeport.
A 1992 study in Bridgeport by Dr. Catherine Oleksiw for Bridgeport Future Initiatives concluded that "habits formed in the early grades affected students in high school." "Unfortunately, many parents and students in urban schools are so caught up in issues surrounding day-to-day survival that they do not consider school attendance a top priority."
But Mr. Connelly says he is encouraged by the already-demonstrated success of the new program.
"This is the kind of program that has already shown very promising results in one of our previously poorly attended schools and there's no reason it can't work throughout the school system," he said. "It's a terrific model that works."
Truancy experts agree.
"This program has worked and will work as long as there is strong parental involvement -- that's really the key," said Matt George, director of student support service for the city of Bridgeport.
"What this program does so impressively is organize the parents and coordinate an active participation among parents, teachers and other educators," said Mr. George.
Charles Norman, acting president and chief executive officer of the Norwalk-based Fairfield County Community Foundation, which is supporting the program, with a nearly $50,000 grant, said the project is the most exciting anti-truancy effort he has ever seen. "A program that promotes close ties among young students, school personnel, parents and members of the community" to reduce unexcused absences, he said, is "very compelling."

HEADLINE: Keeping Children Off the Streets

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE supervisor of the New Haven Police Department's juvenile services, Lieut. Douglas MacDonald, placed his hands on the shoulders of a 12-year-old boy standing in front of him. The boy, just under 4 feet tall and weighing about 50 pounds, fixed his eyes on the floor and said nothing. He had just been arrested for car theft, and this was not the first time.
"Believe it or not, his feet can reach the pedals," Lieutenant MacDonald said after turning the boy over to another police officer. "I asked him why he wasn't in school, and he said he had a doctor's appointment. He didn't go the day before because he overslept. His mother told me that if her son got into trouble, he was on his own. When a parent has that response, we can predict the kid won't show up in school. He'll develop a street life and meet up again and again with the criminal justice system." 
 But Lieutenant MacDonald hasn't given up on the boy. New Haven, like other cities in the state, is finding new ways of helping children who are dropping out of school and heading for a lifetime of crime. The police department and schools in New Haven are collaborating with community agencies on several projects aimed at getting truant students off the streets and back into school. They are concentrating their efforts for the first time on the elementary schools, where children begin the habit of skipping school.
"Working with very young children is the way to go. We have to create habits rather than retrain kids later on," said Steven Lindner, who conducts a dropout prevention program in the New Haven schools.
Although there are no statistics on the extent of truancy in the state, the problem is becoming urgent as daytime crime among juveniles increases, according to Mr. Lindner said. "To get kids off the street and get rid of daytime crime, we need to make sure they complete school," he said.
Fueling the concern about truancy is a shortage of job opportunities, given the bad economic climate in the state, said Reginald Mayo, the School Superintendent in New Haven. "I think it's obvious that if young people don't have an education, they will be lost," he said. "Factory jobs are not out there to absorb dropouts."
Under state law, a child must attend school until age 16. Truancy refers to a child between 7 and 16 who has 4 unexcused absences in a month or 10 in a school year. Habitual truancy occurs when a child has 20 or more unexcused absences in a school year. The law requires schools to investigate such cases, and if the child continues to miss school, the case must be referred to juvenile court. A juvenile probation officer meets with the child and his or her parents and investigates the case.
The probation officer may handle certain offenses informally, depending on the seriousness of the allegation, the child's history and the attitude of the parents. The probation officer may decide to dismiss the case, refer the child and family to a social service agency or ask the court to intervene.
In New Haven, a pilot anti-truancy program started last year was expanded this year to include all the city's schools. Teams made up of truancy officers and police detectives travel through New Haven's neighborhoods every day and round up students who should be in school. The teams picked up more than 500 children in kindergarten through 12th grade during the first two months of the current school year, Mr. Lindner said.
A truancy court recently established in the city handles the cases of students in fifth through eighth grade with 10 or more unexcused absences. The court is composed of students from the New Haven area and a lawyer from the corporation counsel's office. A high school student and a law student serve as the child's mentors. The child is required to attend a hearing, to which parents are invited, and the parents and mentors draw up a contract meant to insure that the child attends school. The mentors follow the student's progress in meeting the terms of the contract.
A mentor is the most important influence in a child's decision to stay in school, Mr. Lindner said. Several organizations in New Haven, including the police and fire departments, provide mentors. "We want to extend a student's family so that truancy is not just a court issue," Mr. Lindner said. "The majority of kids who drop out say there was no one who cared about them and no one to talk to."
Children have learned how to skip school by the time they reach fourth or fifth grade. "When I stayed home, I would replace the answering machine tape with a new one. I would take the phone off the hook, or I wouldn't answer it, because I didn't know if it was my Mom or the school. I was 12," said Verdell Grace, a ninth grader at Hillhouse High School in New Haven.
The boy, who is 16, said his school years have been marked by conflicts with classmates, difficulties with his studies and suspensions and that his anger toward his father, whom he hasn't seen since he was 6 years old, makes it hard for him to concentrate in class. "Every time I hear about him, I get upset," he said. "I hear what the teacher is saying, but my mind is somewhere else."
It was in fourth grade, Verdell said, that "My attitude started kicking in. I would go to school upset. Somebody would say something to me, and I would flip. I needed someone to talk to, someone who would look out for me and make sure I didn't get into trouble."
By the time he reached seventh grade, he started staying home. But his mother, who works as a nurse, insisted that he finish high school. She called a truant officer, Robert Turner, this year after she became concerned that her son was skipping school. Mr. Turner has helped smooth out the mother-son relationship and arranged a summer job for Mr. Grace as a caddy.
After high school Verdell would like to be a carpenter; in the meantime, he's looking for a job after school and on weekends. He also takes classes in martial arts and plays African drums in a group that performs at local festivals.
Although he was recently suspended for a week for fighting with a classmate, Verdell does plan to finish high school. "They say if you're 16, you don't have to go to school," he said. "But I have no choice; my mother keeps me going. I'm so used to going now, it's simple."
New Haven is encouraging children to stay in school in other ways. A middle school sports program started this year allows students to participate only if they attend school and receive an hour of tutoring daily. Third graders take part in classroom exercises that teach them to think twice before staying home from school. Children with perfect attendance are rewarded with free tickets to New Haven Ravens baseball games.
In the West End section of Bridgeport, a two-year truancy prevention project was started in 1993 at Longfellow School that includes pre-kindergarten through eighth grade. The project focused on children with 40 to 50 absences in the first four months of school, said Judith Watson, a social psychologist and consultant with Action for Bridgeport Community Development, the agency that funded the project.
A truancy team checked the school's absentee report every morning and visited the homes of youngsters who were habitually absent.
"We discovered that that kind of attention to the children and their families was effective in keeping those kids in school," Ms. Watson said. At the end of the project, Longfellow School had the best attendance rate in the city. The program is continuing this year with volunteers.
Tracking down truant children is not the only factor in keeping them in school. Longstanding habits and attitudes must be changed, said Jettie Tisdale, principal of Longfellow School. Ms. Tisdale added that parents create the biggest problem. "We have a breakfast program that can serve 300 kids. But I get less than 60," she said. "The parents won't get up in the morning and get their kids out to school."
A home-school coordinator, hired by the school, conducts classes for parents in child care, Ms. Tisdale said. "Some you'll save and some you won't," she said. "If one parent sees another getting the kids to school on time, she will do it, too. It's like building a house with a good foundation. These are habits you need when you have a job. You have to go to work on time, or you won't keep that job."

HEADLINE: Dentist-Anesthesiologists Are Pushing for Formal Recognition

BYLINE: By JOAN SWIRSKY 

 BODY:
IT was not front-line combat as a marine in the Vietnam War that undid Michael Arms. Nor the time he was mugged and stabbed in the Bronx.
Rather Mr. Arms, director of the North Shore Animal League in Port Washington, said: "Nothing is as traumatic for me as going to the dentist. I'm one of those phobic people who wouldn't even go for a checkup, because even the sound of the drill or a shot of novocain is enough to keep me away." 
 But a few years ago Mr. Arms learned from a friend that he could receive general anesthesia in a dentist's office. "Now," he said, "when I walk in I have no fear. And when I walk out, I'm in a good mood."
That does not surprise Dr. Ralph Epstein, a dentist-anesthesiologist in Great Neck. "There is a clear need for general anesthesia in dentists' offices," Dr. Epstein said. "But most people don't know it exists."
Dr. Epstein is one of 98 dentist-anesthesiologists -- Long Island has nine -- who have received board certification through the American Dental Board of Anesthesiology. He and his colleagues have studied the administration of general anesthesia in two- and three-year postdoctoral programs.
Their offices are equipped to intubate, or place protective airways in the windpipes, and to administer intravenous, inhalation and intramuscular anesthesia.
In contrast, oral surgeons receive four months of anesthesia training in a typical four-year program.
In 1993 the American Society of Dental Anesthesiologists asked its parent body, the American Dental Association, to recognize its speciality. The major impediment to approval has been an A.D.A directive that the anesthesiologists prove the "need and demand" for their services.
Dr. Epstein said that assertion was bogus and that there was a latent demand for the services that he and his colleagues offer. "People who acquired cell phones and fax machines over the last few years didn't demonstrate their need for better communication by picketing in the streets," he said. "They heard by word of mouth that something better was out there. It's the same with dental anesthesia. The need is there, but people don't know it exists. So how can they ask for it?
"A vast number of people are not getting the dental care they need, because they are terrified of the drill, of pain and of what they imagine will be the worst experience of their lives. I thought the A.D.A. would applaud this effort. Instead they told us it wasn't necessary."
At a meeting in Washington last month the anesthesiologists' group instituted a board of diplomates that, in effect, confers specialist status on its members.
The associate executive director for education for the American Association of Oral-Maxillofacial Surgeons, Randi V. Andresen, said all the criteria for specialist eligibility had not been fulfilled.
"There are nurse-anesthetists and medical anesthesiologists," Ms. Andresen said. "So there's no need for more people administering anesthesia. Unless dentists also do general dentistry, as well as anesthesia, the need for this service is simply not there. There's no way for itinerant anesthesiologists who travel to different dentist offices to know if these facilities have the ability to handle emergencies. The patient has the right to know this. This is a matter of safety."
Dr. Epstein said premiums for dental-liability insurance for dentist-anesthesiologists country had increased in the last 10 years.
The anesthesiologists want to advertise themselves as specialists. For several years the Federal Trade Commission has been reviewing their complaints about "the restriction of truthful, nondeceptive advertising," said Sally Maxwell, a senior lawyer in the competition bureau at the commission. "A similar complaint against the American Medical Association was adjudicated in the 70's," Ms. Maxwell said. That case had several appeals before the United States Supreme Court upheld the complaint. Since we're the health-care division of the F.T.C. we learn about these issues through professional journals and people who write and call us with grievances."
The commission has not set a date for a hearing.
In 1972 and 1988 the F.T.C. said that the A.D.A. rules that prohibit the self-designation of specialty status were "not reasonable" and issued an order to stop the "restricting, impeding or advising against the advertising of dental-care services."
The general counsel for the A.D.A., Peter M. Sfikas, said the ruling had dissenters. "We subscribe to the dissenting opinions," Mr. Sfikas said.
The A.D.A. recognizes eight specialist categories, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics, dentofacial orthodontics, oral pathology, endodontics, pediatric dentistry, prosthodontics and dental public health.
Dr. Epstein said the two-year hospital and university training programs were threatened. He added that the Health Care Financing Administration reimbursement policy required that a specialty in dentistry be accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation.
"But this is the very body that refuses to accredit us," he said. "It was clear to us during out lengthy appeal process that politics and economics were driving the A.D.A.'s judgment. Every one of the A.D.A.'s numerous committees approved of recognizing us. But ultimately intense competition from the 6,000-member organization that represents oral-maxillofacial surgeons prevailed."
Many specialists, including oral surgeons, seek friendly relationships with dentist-anesthesiologists, Dr. Epstein said, adding, "But this camaraderie has unfortunately been eclipsed by the kind of market forces that are increasingly defining how medicine is practiced."
"There is absolutely no competition involved," Ms. Andresen said. "There aren't that many dentist-anesthesiologists in the country to even raise that issue."
Two consumers, Danusia Pawska and her husband, Elliot Cohen, said the competition issue was alive. After having driven from their home in Old Greenwich, Conn., to Dr. Epstein's office for anesthesia for their son Anson, 6, who is learning disabled and asthmatic, Ms. Pawska said, "The patient should come first, not some group that is protesting a possible loss of income."
After her son had initially been evaluated in Connecticut, she recounted, she was told that he would have to enter a hospital for his dental work, at a cost of $2,500. "When I asked them if Anson could have the same procedure in an office, they told me no," Ms. Pawska said. She scheduled him for admission, "weeks in advance, which was the only time they had space for him," and he developed an abscess.
Ms. Pawska consulted a dentist in New York City who referred the case to Dr. Epstein and his wife, Dr. Mary George, a pediatric dentist. Anson's two-hour removal, under general anesthesia, proceeded uneventfully.
"I stayed with him in the recovery room and was there when he woke up," Ms. Pawska said. "It's a shame so few of these specialists exist and that people can't have their children's needs taken care of all in one office. It was worth the trip, and I'll always make it. Here I know that my son's special needs will be understood, and that's worth everything."
To some on Long Island the dispute has personal consequences, too. When Steven Frome took an autistic son, Joshua, to Dr. Epstein, he said, "it was the first time in my son's 17 years that he was able to tolerate dental care."
"The hospital environment was so unfamiliar and anxiety producing," Mr. Frome, executive vice president of the Parker Jewish Geriatric Institute in New Hyde Park, said, said, "that it would take five or six people to hold Joshua down just to start the IV. But the dentist office is familiar and friendly, and he doesn't mind going at all.
"I understand health care from the payers' perspective. In a dentist's office you are not paying the hospital's overhead fee."
Dentist-anesthesiologists say they can halve hospital "facility fees," or up to $2,000. Because insurance companies often do not cover dental work, that represents a sizable savings for patients who, Dr. Epstein said, might never seek care "until it's too late."
But Ms. Andresen said costs increased when dentist-anesthesiologists were present. "People have to pay two people to treat them," she said, "not only the dentist doing the work, but the one giving anesthesia."
Unlike most dentists, who routinely use local anesthesia dentist-anesthesiologists use a technique that for physicians requires a three-year residency, with the last year in a specialty like cardiac care.
Dentist-anesthesiologists are certified in advanced cardiac life support. Like hospitals, their offices are equipped with emergency equipment and recovery rooms. While traveling, they take along their emergency equipment and supplies.
"Too often," Dr. Epstein said of the autistic, the retarded and other people who have special problems, "these patients don't receive dental work until end-stage conditions exist. Years, even decades, go by, and small problems become unnecessarily large."

HEADLINE: Lilco Under Fire for Warnings on Rate Increases

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
OFFICIALS and private groups are attacking statements by Lilco that an immediate cut in electric rates could undermine its finances and force higher rates next year.
In arguments to the Public Service Commission this month, the Long Island Power Authority and Nassau and Suffolk Counties depicted Lilco and its shareholders as immensely enriched by the 1989 agreement that closed the Shoreham nuclear power plant. The critics said despite statements that it would cooperate in efforts to lower rates the Long Island Lighting Company continued to pursue policies to thwart cuts. 
 The authority and counties argue that the rate cutting that the P.S.C. is considering would have few or no adverse effects on Lilco finances. The steps include an immediate refund to customers of $81 million paid by Suffolk County for excess assessments of Shoreham.
The power authority called on the P.S.C. to reduce rates $154.9 million, or 6.5 percent. Of that 4.5 percent would be a one-time deal from the $81 million refund and $25.9 million from other sources. The remaining 2 percent would come from adjustments in how fuel savings are passed along to customers.
Describing Lilco as financially sound, the authority said the utility's higher-than-average debt, rather than signifying financial weakness, reflected a decision to pay high dividends instead of reducing debt.
In another indication of pressure to revise the 1989 agreement, the authority asked the commission to examine rate of return on the $4.4 billion that Lilco is allowed to recover for Shoreham.
"The P.S.C. should consider whether Lilco's rate of return should be allowed to continue when over two-thirds of its rate base consists of paper assets, which have no operational risk, maintenance costs or capital expenditures," said the acting executive director of the authority, Anastasia Song. The authority is negotiating separately with Lilco on a plan backed by Gov. George E. Pataki to disband the utility and cut electric rates by 12 percent. Under the plan the authority would sell tax-exempt bonds to buy the Lilco transmission and distribution systems. The generators and gas business would be sold to separate companies.
The 12 percent rate reduction, much of it from refinancing Lilco debt through bonds, would be in addition to the 6.5 reduction that the authority seeks. A ruling on the reductions is apparently weeks away.
The discussions result from a P.S.C. order in February that required Lilco to show why it should not immediately refund the $81 million payment and the $25.9 million in excess revenues and make other adjustments. In a response last month Lilco said that the money should be used to reduce a $380 million deferred debt that customers owe for Shoreham. The utility also warned that any sign that support for the 1989 agreement was weakening would alarm investors, harm Lilco financially and create a need for higher rates.
The agreement, between Lilco and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and endorsed by the P.S.C., promised the recovery of the Shoreham costs and included so-called rate moderation and other measures to ease or defer rate increases to pay for the plant.
Suffolk now says Lilco badgers the commission to reaffirm the 1989 pact on the company's terms. The county said Lilco had made numerous references to "the 1989 agreement's goal of returning Lilco's credit rating to investment grade," but made "no mention at all of Lilco's successful and deliberate efforts to keep itself teetering on the brink of junk-bond status, thereby holding its ratepayers and the commission hostage to its scheme of high prices for its ratepayers and generous dividends for its shareholders."
"For six years the commission has complied with the 1989 agreement, and Long Island has paid the price," the county said. "Lilco pursued a corporate strategy of aggressively paying out dividends when more responsible management would have paid down debt. Only by putting itself squarely in harm's way could Lilco hope to persuade the P.S.C. that without the P.S.C.'s unwavering support of Lilco's agenda it will perish."
The county hired a financial expert on the power industry, Charles M. Studness, who said, "The dominant feature of Lilco's financial position is its extremely strong cash flow." Mr. Studness noted that Lilco expected to generate $1.96 billion in cash from 1996 to 2000 after capital expenditures and paying dividends to holders of preferred shares. He said the utility intended to pay $1.09 billion of that "discretionary cash flow" to shareholders in dividends and to use $870 million to retire debt.
The high debt would be lower "if Lilco had pursued a conservative dividend policy," Mr. Studness said, adding that the utility borrowed $667 million from 1989 to 1993 to pay dividends.
"Lilco's strong cash flow and untapped opportunities to increase efficiency provide a basis for substantial reduction of Lilco's electric rates," the consultant said.
An economic model projected a "meaningful reduction in electric rates" of 5 percent would create 2,500 jobs, Mr. Studness said, and a "moderate reduction" of 10 percent would create 5,000 jobs. A 50 percent reducting, taking the Lilco rates down to the national average, would create 25,000 jobs, he estimated.
Lilco rates are the highest in the continental United States.
A reduction is "in the public interest and can be effectuated without Lilco suffering any financial or operational harm," Nassau said in its brief. "Lilco's pleadings to the contrary are nothing more than attempts to obfuscate the fact that Lilco continues to ignore the repeated cries for deserved rate relief for its customers in favor of maintaining a high level of profits and dividends for its investors."
Nassau said speedy payment of the debt was not warranted because the utility industry was experiencing increased competition. The restructuring of the industry is "on our doorstep," the county said, suggesting that another P.S.C. proceeding might result in lowering of the Shoreham recovery total.
"It is this uncertainty that the financial markets have and will continue to evaluate," the county said.
"A P.S.C. decision to provide much needed rate relief to Lilco's customers," the brief continued, "should not affect the financial markets."
In an attack on the 1989 pact the county said Lilco had "entered into what turned out to be a disastrously expensive and failed nuclear-plant investment" and then won an agreement with the Cuomo administration that charged customers for its errors and rewarded shareholders.
A consultant for Nassau, James D. Cotton of the Columbia Group Inc. in Ridgefield, Conn., said that the county had steadfastly demanded the $81 million tax refund be used to lower rates and that the P.S.C. could decide how to allocate the money.
What the commission decides may determine what it does with a potentially even larger tax refund Suffolk that faces in another case. Lilco is seeking up to $500 million for excess assessments of Shoreham in more recent years in a suit before Justice Thomas M. Stark of State Supreme Court in Riverhead.
Other groups joined in urging the P.S.C. to cut rates now. "The P.S.C. should take this opportunity to spark a revival of Long Island's economy by beginning to restore electricity prices to more reasonable levels," said Robert Ceisler, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer group in Albany.
The Association for a Better Long Island asked to "end Lilco's practicing of using the decommissioned Shoreham atomic plant as a basis for charging customers for power." The builders' group said Mr. Pataki had "put into place a Public Service Commission board that is not a tool of the utilities."
"There now needs to be an alliance that can confront the legions of Lilco lawyers who seek to deny any opportunity at rate reduction," the president of the business group, Jan Berman, said.

HEADLINE: Whalers In Need of a Few (More) Good Fans

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
THE Mayor of Hartford, Michael P. Peters, says that if the Whalers decide to leave his city, "I'll be the guy lying down in front of the moving trucks."
Given the Whalers' endangered species status in the state's capital, Mr. Peters could get run over -- and soon, at that. For if a last-ditch campaign to keep the team in Hartford fails, the owner of the Whalers may very well decide next month to end the team's 21-year stay in Connecticut. 
 That would would not only cost the state its only major league sports team but also deprive the Hartford Civic Center of its primary tenant -- a devastating thought for the restaurants, bars and other small businesses in the immediate environs that count on games to generate business.
Unless the Whalers can sell close to 11,000 season tickets and lease most of 45 sky boxes in the Civic Center by May 1, yesterday afternoon's game against the Boston Bruins may have been the Whalers' last in Hartford. And tonight's final season game against the Buffalo Sabres in Buffalo could be Hartford's swan song in the National Hockey League.
Peter Karamanos, a Detroit businessman who owns the Whalers, concedes that those goals will be extremely difficult to achieve, considering that only 5,800 season tickets were sold this season and only 27 sky boxes leased, at season prices of $62,000 to $72,000.
Making it even more difficult, perhaps, was the team's decision to raise ticket prices for next season, if there is a next season in Hartford, by an average of about $6 a game on the day that the ticket drive began, April 1.
"If the ticket drive falls on its face, we could leave," said Mr. Karamanos. "You can't say you want a major league team and average 10,000 fans a game."
Mr. Karamanos would probably have no trouble relocating. Cleveland, San Antonio, Nashville and Portland, Ore., are among the big-market cities that have been trying to lure an N.H.L. team.
Under a 1994 agreement with the Connecticut Development Authority, a quasi-public body, Mr. Karamanos is free to take the Whalers elsewhere following the 1997-98 season if the team has lost $30 million by then.
But Mr. Karamanos, who has owned the Whalers for only two seasons, says that he has already lost $31 million on the team.
"I think that in light of our losses that the state would give us permission to leave," Mr. Karamanos said. "When you've lost as much money as we have, you have to look around and ask what we're doing here."
A lot of people have been wondering about that ever since the Whalers, then in the old World Hockey Association, moved from Boston to Hartford during the 1974-75 season, lured in large measure by the brand new Hartford Civic Center.
For one thing, Hartford, unlike New Haven (which has had minor league hockey teams on and off since 1936), had no hockey tradition. For another, the team has never been a success, either on the ice or at the box office. It has had only three winning seasons and scored its box-office high, of just 14,574 fans per game, in 1987-88.
Indeed, most of the state's hockey fans back either the New York Rangers or the Boston Bruins, depending on where they live. Even those involved in the campaign to Save the Whale(rs) concede that at least 90 percent of Whaler fans live in Hartford County or very near.
"And the team can't survive as just a Hartford team," said Lou Beer, the team's consultant for business affairs, who, like Mr. Karamanos lives in the Detroit area but of late has been spending most of his time in Hartford. "But developing an affinity between the Whalers and the rest of the state is a four- to five-year process, and we don't have that much time. So we have to jumpstart the process."
In an effort to do so, Gov. John G. Rowland and Lieut. Gov. M. Jodi Rell invited corporate leaders in the state to a meeting on April 2. About 50 people attended, but only one large corporation from the southern part of the state, U.S. Surgical (based in Norwalk), sent a representative.
Last Friday, the Capitol Regional Council of Governments invited town officials and civic leaders from 29 Hartford area municipalities to discuss ways to insure that the Whalers remain in Hartford.
With the slogan "The Puck Stops Here," a Kansas City marketing firm is coordinating the ticket-selling drive, trying to get Connecticut corporations into a "marketing partnership" with the Whalers, said Mitch Wheeler, president of the firm, Marketing Associates International Inc. Losing the Whalers would relegate Hartford and Connecticut to "minor league status," he said, as well as hurting economic and community growth.
The Hartford Courant, which has been conducting a "Whale Watch" on game attendance, has gone even further, saying editorially that "the loss of the team would unquestionably be devastating to the region's economy and self-esteem."
William H. Russell, a chairman (with Michael E. Waller, the publisher of The Courant) of a task force set up by the Hartford Downtown Council, says "The Whalers are critical to the city's renaissance."
And Tony Caruso, the executive director of the Downtown Council, said it was estimated that the Whalers have been responsible for generating about $100 million annually in business for the Hartford area.
"The team is also one of the best recruiting tools we have for the city, particularly for young executives companies are trying to lure here," Mr. Caruso said.
But some people have questioned whether it has been in the state's interest to invest millions of dollars in a team that attracts scant statewide support. And some recent studies have indicated that economic benefits from a major league sports team are marginal at best, despite supporters' arguments.
The idea that a major league team enhances a city's morale has caused some black civic leaders in Hartford to point out that in a city dominated by blacks and Hispanics it is rare to see a nonwhite face at a Whalers' game. Further, it is pointed out, hockey is rarely played by black or Hispanic youngsters.
Both Mr. Karamanos and James Rutherford, a former N.H.L. goalkeeper who is the team's president and general manager, praised the administrations of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker and of Governor Rowland for trying to insure that the Whalers remain in Connecticut.
To that end, the state has allocated millions of dollars in grants and loans to prop up the franchise, along with buying the team from the previous owner, Richard Gordon, a Hartford developer, and then, through the Connecticut Development Authority, selling it to Mr. Karamanos. "The state has done everything they could," Mr. Karamanos said.
As for the city, the club's ownership has been unhappy for years over a policy that precludes the team from sharing in parking and concession revenues, which most N.H.L. teams do. So Mayor Peters has suggested that parking lot and garage owners near the the Civic Center contribute a share of their profits -- say, $1 a car -- to the team. But that may not strike a responsive chord, given that the Whalers' player payroll has quadrupled from $5 million in 1988-89 to $20.5 million this season.
Neither, perhaps, will comments by Whaler officials that, should the team remain in Hartford, a new arena would be needed to provide more sky boxes -- a thought the owners now seem to backing away from. "That has to be part of our longterm thinking," said Mr. Beer. "But it's ludicrous to think about a new arena when we can't fill the one we now have."
Mr. Rutherford agreed. "A new arena would be something to consider 8 or 10 years down the road," he said, adding that the Whalers' share of receipts amounts to about $300,000 a game compared with as much as $800,000 for some other N.H.L. clubs.
At this stage, Whalers' officials say, corporate support and a broadening base of fan support are the keys to staying in Hartford.
"We can't expect much more from the state," Mr. Rutherford said. "But pretty soon, we're going to have to sit down and see if it makes sense to stay in Hartford."

HEADLINE: Make Big Hollywood $$ in the Comfort of Your Home

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IN Hollywood's jargon, Susan Gardner's home was discovered. A film scout scouring the neighborhood for the ideal crime scene knocked on her door and asked if she wanted to transform her home into a stage set and reap a few thousand dollars for the bother.
Since then, Ms. Gardner's suburban estate, 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles in Westlake Village, has been immortalized on screen. She and her husband, Doug, and daughter, Katie, patiently endure a slalom course of light stands and the inevitable scuffed walls caused by careless filming. But the fees can approach $1,500 a day. 
 "A film person just walked up to the door and said we had the perfect foyer for their show's murder," Ms. Gardner said. "This is the easiest money you can possibly make next to winning the lottery."
Ms. Gardner is among hundreds of homeowners in the Los Angeles area who are prospering thanks to the production industry's growing desire to use genuine rather than studio-manufactured settings for films.
According to the Entertainment Industry Development Corporation, the office that oversees filming in Los Angeles County, the number of shooting days in county streets and homes last year grew by nearly 25 percent to 33,500. The growth is driven in part by network newcomers like United Paramount and the flourishing independent and straight-to-video market.
It is often cheaper for a studio to rent a private home than to build a stage set. So production companies recruit the properties of people like Paula Iny, who owns a "Miami Vice"-like mansion in Encino, just north of Los Angeles.
Recently, Ms. Iny's home was being used as a backdrop for the low-budget thriller, "The Dentist," starring the former "L.A. Law" star Corbin Bernsen as a love-spurned professional turned maniac.
Workers cleared Ms. Iny's living room of all its furnishings, boxed away breakables and transformed the space for the camera into an office with a faux marble desk. Around it, they packed the paraphernalia of Hollywood production equipment for Mr. Bernsen's next scene.
Ms. Iny stood guard lest a crew member scratch the entry-hall floor with heavy equipment or perhaps stain the swimming pool with stage blood during the on-camera murder.
"I like to stay here for the peace of mind," Ms. Iny said, as studio assistants swung a camera crane in her dining room just above a fragile glass banister. "Sometimes I think I should leave, and that way when I come back everything will be in its place."
MS. INY, who lives with her husband, Benjamin, and their two children, says she shows the house to prospective studio renters at a moment's notice and signs the necessary documents that spell out the rooms to be used, hours of filming and the fee.
So far, the Iny home has starred in such productions as the television series "Beverly Hills 90210," the film "Ghost in the Machine," and in music videos by the singer formerly known as Prince and the rapper Ice Cube.
A contract with a major studio film is the Oscar of homeowner paychecks, followed by television series, commercials and B-grade movies. The reward of up to $4,000 a day varies with home size, production budget and number of crew members.
That profit can nearly double if free home improvements are lavished on the property. Lucy M. Edwards of Pasadena, Calif., 12 miles northeast of Los Angeles, said her Victorian mansion, which was growing dowdy with age, has now been nearly restored to its former grandeur by decor-conscious film makers working to make the furnishings suited the script.
"When Debbie Allen was producer of 'Polly' with Phylicia Rashad, I had gold carpeting here that I hated," Ms. Edwards said. "They put in a dusty rose colored carpet that's just lovely. The film 'Jo Jo Dancer' put up wallpaper worth $7,000 in the front room. And I think the TV series 'Gangster Chronicles' papered the bedroom."
Before choosing a film site, production companies generally sift through the thousands of properties listed through local film commissions and private location services (which earn a 20 to 40 percent finder's fee). Some houses can languish in obscurity while others enjoy a near-blockbuster status.
The quaint Victorian is perhaps more often than not a fictional character's home of choice. And unless a show is location-specific like a Western or surfing film, the scripts call strictly for Americana.
"Producers want the back-East look," said Jean Ferguson, owner of Ferguson's Location Library, one of the largest private location services in the country. "Palm trees are usually too Southern California. They want a house that looks like Anywhere U.S.A."
Perhaps the ultimate test of a home's star potential is square-footage. Owners might consider their living room to be spacious, but many forget that it must accommodate dozens of camera assistants plus equipment. Not surprisingly, big bathrooms are always in demand, as was Ms. Iny's, which has a whirlpool bath and fireplace.
Homeowners say studios generally keep their promises to return a home to how they found it. This often requires touching up walls with paint and shampooing soiled carpets. Though homeowners may be satisfied with the arrangement, some of their neighbors frequently bemoan it once the assault of equipment trucks and film crews begin.
IT sometimes takes artful persuasion and perhaps sheer bribery for a production crew to get permission for night shots from affected residents, a necessity in some towns.
If charm does not work, location managers may try the more material appeal of fruit baskets, block party barbecues and, on rare occasions, pocket money.
"If all-night filming is going to be a disruption, I can put people in a hotel," said Gary deGalla, a film location manager. "If I am establishing a full-time location for, say, nine days, I might host a neighborhood get-together and bring sandwiches and soda so that the filming experience is not all negative."
If a show is a success, homeowners can expect an onslaught of gawking tourists like those who mill outside the Los Angeles area home used for the exterior shots in the television series "The Brady Bunch." The addresses of some residences used in filming are publicized in tour guides and for years afterward their sidewalks fill with bus tour cinephiles.
Many cities welcome the economic infusion of glitter. One study by the Nevada Motion Picture Division of the Commission on Economic Development showed that a production could pump nearly $100,000 a day into a community through catering, wages and tourism.
For example, thousands of people drive for hours across Iowa to toss a ball and buy souvenirs where Kevin Costner carved a baseball diamond in a cornfield in "Field of Dreams."
James Cleary, a Los Angeles accountant, says the best thing about welcoming the entertainment industry to his home is that the first 14 days of rental a year are exempt from Federal income taxes. And that alone makes his life of packing and unpacking his home to a studio schedule worth the trouble.
"When I make $4,000 from a production in a week, it's like making $8,000 from my day job because I don't have to pay any taxes," Mr. Cleary said. "And I think that I can stand a little inconvenience for that. It's a wonderful way to make fast cash."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
INVESTING WITH: Robert W. Bissell

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
WHEN stock investors look for safety, they flock to companies that are paying high dividends. For whatever the ups and downs of the stock market, these holdings produce a steady stream of income.
 The comparable investment in mutual funds is the equity-income category. Its funds invest in just such high-yielding stocks. With volatility increasing and talk persistent about how long it has been since a 10 percent decline in the broad stock market, these funds make sense for the conservative.
Among the strong performers in the category is the Stagecoach Diversified Income Fund, which was in the top 25 percent in the first two months of 1996. Robert W. Bissell, 48, chief equity investment officer for Wells Fargo Bank in Los Angeles, has been manager of the fund, now at more than $100 million in assets, since its inception in November 1992. He manages $1.5 billion, including private accounts, in the same style. 
 He aims for a combination of decent yields,now 3.44 percent annually at Stagecoach Diversified Income, and capital growth. Typical of his fund and other equity-income funds are blue-chip stocks. He characterized his investment style as buying companies with strong fundamentals when "investor expectations are low" -- in other words, value investing. But another thread runs through much of his portfolio: a belief in management. A couple of his biggest holdings are companies run by former Wells Fargo executives.
 Mr. Bissell puts a third of the portfolio in his 10 favorite stocks, including Ford Motor, Bankers Trust New York, ARCO and I.B.M., and puts the balance in 40 to 50 other issues.
A longtime holding is Household International, the consumer finance company in Prospect Heights, Ill. From time to time, the shares of Household International rally, and Mr. Bissell trims his holdings to prevent his position from going over 5 percent of the fund's assets. "That's an internal collar we use, for diversification purposes, and it's the only time we sell this company," he said. "It represents everything we believe in."
Generally, the fund holds a stock until the price rises to what Mr. Bissell considers fair value, a more compelling opportunity arises or something causes him to reconsider his investment.
Last year, the fund sold its stake in PNC Holdings after that bank company acquired Midlantic Bank of New Jersey. The acquisition was made with stock, which Mr. Bissell thought would dilute earnings about 10 percent in the first year. The fund realized an average gain of $5 a share, or 21 percent, on its one-year investment in PNC, the manager said.
His buy-and-hold strategy results in little turnover, about 40 percent annually of the portfolio, and it often means that Mr. Bissell invests cash coming into the fund in long-held positions.
 
 
A Leaner Lender
 Stagecoach began buying Household International in fall 1994, when William Aldinger, the former vice chairman of Wells Fargo, became Household's chief executive. "We knew Bill very well, and that's what created our interest," Mr. Bissell said.
Mr. Aldinger cut Household's annual expenses from nearly 60 cents on each dollar of operating revenue to 54 cents in 1995, and Mr. Bissell expects a decline to 45 cents by 1998. Household, which issues the General Motors credit card, has built up a cash reserve to help withstand a possible increase in write-offs, something industry analysts are concerned about as consumer debt and late payments rise. Household's reserve is equal to 5.4 percent of card receivables, compared with an average of 1.9 percent at other specialty-card issuers, Mr. Bissell said.
He expects profits to reach $5.10 a share this year, up from $4.30 in 1995. Over the next two to three years, he said, earnings could grow 20 percent. The fund paid an average of $36 each for its Household shares, and although the stock is trading at nearly twice that amount, the manager still considers them a value. "Our target price on this stock is $130 within two years," he said.
 
Problem? No, Opportunity
 Bankers Trust New York also has new management, in the wake of a derivatives debacle last year that led to client lawsuits and a tumbling stock price. "What the market sees as a problem," he said, "we see as a buying opportunity."
The new chief executive, Frank Newman, is a former Under Secretary of the Treasury with banking experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo. "We think Frank is the right person to restore balance and reputation to Bankers Trust," Mr. Bissell said.
Stagecoach bought its stake last fall, when Mr. Newman was hired, at an average cost of $67. Bankers Trust's profits plunged last year to $2.03 a share, sharply less than the $4 dividend, and the fear of a cut in the payout hangs over the stock. Mr. Bissell, however, expects earnings to rebound this year to $6.75 a share, an aggressive target.
Along with playing down of derivatives, Mr. Newman reduced the company's reliance on trading for its own account. The trading made earnings volatile, which Wall Street doesn't like.
 
A Better Idea?
 The last auto maker to revamp, Ford Motor is poised to be the first in performance in the last years of this decade, Mr. Bissell said.
The company has announced plans under the rubric Ford 2000 to move to an international from a regional operational structure, reducing the number of vehicle platforms, the underlying structures, to 16 from 24, and cutting expenses 20 percent to 30 percent. Another element is a reduction in capital spending, "which frees up a lot of cash for either a higher dividend or share repurchases," Mr. Bissell said.
A frequent trader of Ford's stock, Mr. Bissell began building his most recent position about a year ago at an average cost of $27 a share. The stock is now trading in the mid-$30's, but he values it at about $40. He expects earnings, $3.58 a share last year, to edge up to $5 in 1997, a considerably more optimistic view than the consensus on Wall Street. "We really see the 1997-99 time frame as when the earnings increases will be the most significant," Mr. Bissell said.
The recent downturn in the market did not frighten Mr. Bissell, who has about 5 percent of his portfolio in cash. "It's not a surprise to see bonds back up to 7 percent, but the reason for that weakness isn't inflation; it's the outlook for a better economy, and that should help our companies, Ford in particular," he said.

Hot Heads On Hairdresser Lane

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
STROLL along Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, anytime, any day of the week, and in the hubbub of commerce you'll find people getting their hair permed, weaved, braided, blow-dried, curled, wrapped or set.
When it comes to black American coiffures, Flatbush Avenue is the hairstyling mecca. On the avenue, styles are done with outrageous flair that tend more toward five-inch beehives than pixie cuts, and the women who wear them want to turn heads. 
 The street is a kaleidoscopic zone of tiny hair salons and beauty supply stores. There are stores selling hair, human and synthetic, and stores selling hair-care products. There are hair consultants, hairstylists and hair doctors. The section of Flatbush between Winthrop Street and Parkside Avenue alone boasts eight salons and two beauty supply stores.
Hard data on Flatbush's hair industry are elusive. Neither the National Association of Black Hair Stylists nor the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce had figures. But several people in the area, among them stylists, shop owners and street chroniclers, say the trend dates back 10 years or longer and directly coincides with demographic changes.
"It's become known as 'Hairdresser Lane,' " said Fadare Bashiri Imhotep, owner of Shear Perfection at 941 Flatbush, a 4,000-square-foot, two-story shop that's more hair-care mall than salon. "I've been in the area for the last 10 to 12 years and in the last 5 years, the black hairstyling business has mushroomed beyond comparison."
The boom can be traced, in part, to a wave of immigrant entrepreneurs. Much in the way Koreans gained an economic foothold through greengroceries and nail salons, scores of West Indian immigrants are building an empire of their own in hair, attracted by the relatively low rents of Flatbush Avenue and by its cachet as a hairstyling center.
Doll Lakhan Gibbs, a native of Trinidad, once worked as a sales clerk in the beauty supply store she owns, which now bears her given name. The previous owner, an Italian-American, knew the trade but had lost touch with his market, she said.
"The area had changed demographically," said Ms. Lakhan Gibbs,"and what was once an area that was 80 percent white became 80 percent black and Caribbean. The store was still carrying products for white hair. When I bought it 20 years ago, I started stocking products blacks needed for their hair."
In a textbook case of supply meeting demand, Ms. Lakhan Gibbs opened Doll's Beauty Supply at 700 Flatbush and, 10 years later, Doll's Unisex Salon at 716 Flatbush. Following in her footsteps was Yasmeen Bibi, a Trinidadian who had worked as a stylist at Doll's. Two months ago, Ms. Bibi opened Satisfaction Guaranteed, a unisex salon, across the street from her old boss. "There's room enough for all of us," said Ms. Bibi. "The clients are here."
Indeed.
A recent Thursday afternoon was a typical hair day on the avenue. Salons were crowded with men and women whose hair was in various stages of preparation, from those paying $10 for a basic haircut to those paying $100 for braids and weaves. Clair Wharwood, a stylist at Shear Perfection, estimated that 150 clients would be styled that day and 200 each on Friday and Saturday.
"Some Saturdays I don't leave here until 2 A.M. Sunday morning," Ms. Wharwood said with a smile and a shrug. "A lot of our customers work in the service jobs like nursing, so they may not leave work until 8 P.M., and we try to accommodate their schedules."
The salons seldom advertise, relying instead on word-of-mouth or fliers. The results justify the methods.
The shops have a steady stream of customers visiting from the West Indies and other countries to see relatives in the city. They stop by to get the latest American hairstyles. Once, a woman flew in from Harare, Zimbabwe, to have her hair done and buy hair-care products.
Kauleen Sandford of London, who was having her hair styled at Doll's, heard about Hairdresser Lane from her cousins in Queens. "There are some good stylists in London," Ms. Sandford said, "but I wanted to have my hair styled here, and my cousin said the avenue had some nice shops and the prices are reasonable."
The success of the industry has not gone unnoticed. Koreans are now moving into the vast black hair business, especially in the area of hair supply. And black salons that have closed in Manhattan often resurface on Flatbush Avenue.
Dr. Joseph Mosely, a trichologist and hair consultant with offices on nearby Nostrand Avenue, said the steady growth in hair care in Brooklyn could be traced in part to the nature of the business.
"It's easy to get into with little money or education," said Dr. Mosely, who started his business in 1950. "I've watched the industry grow and it's not a new phenomenon. The area has a clientele with a deep interest in hair -- immigrants who want to keep up with the American scene."
But hairdressers along the avenue note that there is a downside to that interest. They say they have noticed an increase in clients coming in for weaves because their hair had been damaged by chemicals.And Dr. Mosely says that the growth in the black hair business is directly related to a rise in his own business. "With all of the weaving and attachment and chemical processing of the hair," he said, "we're seeing more and more problems related to damaged hair."

Chart: "HAIRSTYLES: The Scoop on the Scrunch"
The scrunch is one of the most popular black hairstyles to emerge from Flatbush Avenue.
Method -- The hair is finger-combed into deep marcel waves and teased to heights of one to three inches. Extensions ef human or synthetic hair are often added for a full-bodied look. With enough gel and holding spray -- and if the hair is not washed -- the style can last two to three weeks.
Effect -- Retro movie star glamour with an attitude.
Cost -- $35 to $50.

A Time to Ponder Amid Shoots and Buds

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST

 BODY:
APRIL is the month of new beginnings, when the landscape starts to come alive. The earliest bulbs have bloomed; others are up, waiting their turn. Buds on the maple trees, elms and oaks are getting fatter, ready to burst. In some places there are even patches of new grass.
It is a time of anticipation, but it should also be a time of patience. The landscape has been through a long, hard winter when there were many stresses from ice, snow and wind. Ground water damage from dissolved road salt may not show up for several months in browned leaves and stunted growth. 
 Although the outdoors beckons with scads of chores to be done, and there is a yearning to end that cabin fever and rush out to be doing them, it is wise to proceed slowly. Hasty tamping with the soft and soggy ground could mean deep trouble in future weeks.
This spring's wealth of ground moisture is ideal for mending root systems that were parched by the prolonged drought last summer. Many plants, particularly the shallow-rooted trees and shrubs, will be strengthened by the abundant water.
But heavy feet or garden carts can spoil the healing effect. Some of the places to be particularly cautious are in flower borders and in the vegetable patches. Underneath many shoots and tips are pushing up from root systems. They do this with remarkable agility. One day the ground seems bare; the next, there are the new shoots. Interfering with this activity is definitely not a good idea. Some plants, including hostas and platycodon, are so slow to stir, they sometimes seem lost to winter forever. But they too are busy, preparing to poke through.
Heavy footwork in a vegetable garden might be just as serious. All that hard work done last fall to turn over the ground and let it lie fallow for winter snow, freezes, thaws and spring rains must not be ruined now by excess trampling.
In fact, some early birds that had the forethought to prepare their ground last fall have already planted their pea crop, which needs cool weather to germinate and grow. That well-known reminder to plant peas on St. Patrick's Day is a worthy ditty to be heeded.
This is also a season to be cautious about the use of garden chemicals, particularly those grabbed indiscriminately as soon as a browned stem or chewed leaf appears. More to the point these days is less use of garden chemicals and more use of down-to-earth practicality.
More and more professionals are embracing I.P.M. (integrated pest management). It is not just a phase of do-good for the earth philosophy, but an effective and economic method of controlling a wide range of garden pests.
As reported in a recent publication of the Agricultural Research Service, the United States Department of Agriculture initiated an I.P.M. program at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C. At the arboretum, often referred to as the nation's garden, gardeners decided to change their habits and stopped spraying the grounds routinely.
Instead, the arboretum adopted the I.P.M. program in 1992. The total volume of pesticides used dropped by about three-fourths and the report is that the plants are doing better. This is no small gathering of plants either, as the 444 acres support more than 640 new plant varieties as well as old-line stock.
Rather than use massive doses of spray, the arboretum has spot-sprayed -- that is, targeted a specific problem with a specific spray to stop a specific insect. This solution has resulted in a two-thirds reduction in total pesticide costs. Unwritten savings include less risk to the spray handlers and lower expenses for safety equipment.
The I.P.M. program at the National Arboretum has been coordinated by Scott Aker, staff horticulturist. He has found that being an advocate for I.P.M. caused marked changes in human behavior.
"People have to get away from the idea of reaching for a spray can the minute they see one bug on a plant," he said. "They have to realize, for one thing, there may be another bug lurking nearby waiting to eat the first bug. A spray could kill both bugs, or deprive the harmless predatory bug of a meal."
As dull as it may sound, labels on bottles, bags and cans are important reading for anyone who works with plants or tries to control the insects that may feed upon them. Labels reflect years of testing and are written for the user's protection and information. Labels are essential to the correct use of any product.
And there are many more sources of information available. Gardeners need not be afraid to ask questions. It is much better to seek and find out rather than guess at a solution.
When a problem does seem to present itself, the major part of the answer is correct identification. What might be assumed to be a termite, for example, could actually be just a sowbug that could be swept away and forgotten.

HEADLINE: Port Can't Be Held Hostage To Environmental Demands

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Consumers and industries can be grateful for the recent high-profile news coverage of the crisis posed by the buildup of silt in New York Harbor. Unfortunately, much of this discussion is coming late in the game and is laced with unrealistic proposals that can only delay urgently needed solutions. 
 The Port of New York and New Jersey is choking on natural silt deposits from the Hudson, Passaic and Hackensack Rivers because of the failure to find a cost-effective way to remove tainted sediments. Unrealistic environmental demands have raised the costs of disposal so high that they threaten to overwhelm the port's ability to maintain its channels and berths.
The port is an irreplaceable economic asset, creating more than 150,000 jobs both directly and indirectly. Without it, many of those jobs would be lost. Many more truck trips would be needed to move goods into and out of the region, further choking roadways, driving up the cost of goods, worsening environmental and health problems and impairing the region's economic competitiveness.
The solution cannot be found by going back to the future. In a letter to the editor on March 21, Representative Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan argues that that much of the container activity at Ports Newark and Elizabeth should be shifted to Brooklyn. But a modern container port needs large upland space for staging, easy movement of cargo to other modes of transportation, and nearby warehouse and industrial parks for storage and processing. In this region, such amenities are simply not available anywhere but New Jersey.
The Port of New York and New Jersey stands poised to become far and away the most important port on the Atlantic Coast. But unless a realistic, cost-effective solution to the dredging crisis is found soon, the ebb and flow of nature will dictate economic decisions that will forever remake the quality of life and prosperity of the region -- for the worse.

Need Tax Help? So Do the Experts in Washington

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
IT is estimated that about half the Americans who file Form 1040 income-tax returns do the work themselves, spending an average of 12 hours trying to understand the complex laws of the tax system. Many of these 59 million taxpayers will be stuck inside today, trying to complete their returns before tomorrow's filing deadline.
If that isn't frustrating enough, here is a much smaller number to ponder: Of the almost five dozen Senators and Representatives who write the nation's tax laws, only six said they did their own taxes. Most of the rest don't deal with the prose they helped to inspire, instructions like: "Subtract line 8 from line 7. If zero or less, skip lines 10 through 13, enter zero on line 14 below, and go to line 15." Instead, they hire professionals to figure out what it all means. 
 Of the 37 members of the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax legislation begins, only four said they prepared their own taxes. On the other side of the Capitol, only 2 of the 19 members of the Senate Finance Committee, which drafts tax bills, said they did their own returns.
President Clinton can't do his return because his assets are in a blind trust. That is not the case for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Margaret Milner Richardson, who hires a professional, and she is a tax lawyer. Why doesn't she prepare her own?
"It's just the time" it takes away from her work, said Steve Pyrek, a spokesman for the I.R.S.
Senator Bob Dole, who has locked up the Republican Presidential nomination, doesn't do his return, although his campaign office declined to explain why. But another leading Republican, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, boasts that he is "the first Ways and Means chairman to do his own taxes." He said it was important for senior officials to prepare their own returns because it helps them "understand what Americans must go through."
"If we required members of Congress to do their own tax returns," he said, "I really do think we would have a very different tax code."
So what has Mr. Archer gleaned from hunkering down with his tax returns for about 16 hours year after year? He concludes that the current system should be dumped. He said a tax on spending would make more sense because defining taxable income is too complex and, more important, the Internal Revenue Service intrudes too deeply into people's financial affairs.
Of the other committee members, 30 said they hired professionals and three declined comment or did not respond to requests for information. The only members who followed their chairman in completing their own returns were Bill Thomas, Republican of California, and two Democrats, Andrew Jacobs Jr. of Indiana and William J. Coyne of Pennsylvania.
On the Senate Finance Committee, only John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, both Republicans, said they prepared their own taxes.
Republican sponsors of the leading flat-tax proposal are divided on the subject. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, does his own return. But his co-sponsor, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, hires the work out.
And what about the chief staff members for the committees? Phillip Moseley, the Republican chief of staff for the Ways and Means Committee, and his Democratic counterpart, Janice Mays, do their own taxes. Lindy L. Paull, the chief counsel of the Senate Finance Committee, and Mark Patterson, the Democrats' chief counsel, also said they prepared their returns.
Kenneth J. Kies, chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, which analyzes and drafts tax proposals for the House and Senate, said he always did his own taxes.
"I think any tax lawyer who doesn't do their own return ought to be embarrassed," he said. "Secondly, it is the best way to keep informed every year just how we have changed the system and how it is working."
He assumes that the 55 economists and tax lawyers on the committee staff all do their own taxes. Joking, he said, "I would consider firing them if they didn't."
At the I.R.S., the deputy commissioner, Michael P. Dolan, does his own returns. So does the chief of taxpayer compliance, James E. Donelson, and Frank Keith, the senior I.R.S. spokesman.
But the I.R.S. chief counsel, Stuart L. Brown, gets professional help with his return, as does Dave Mader, the chief of management and administration.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, has his fortune in a blind trust. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said his wife, Victoria, a tax lawyer, prepared their return with his help. "Our return is considerably less complicated now that I am in Government," said Mr. Summers, a former chief economist for the World Bank.
Leslie B. Samuels, the Assistant Treasury Secretary for tax policy, prepared his own returns when he was a tax lawyer but has used a professional tax preparer since taking office, said Calvin Mitchell, a Treasury Department spokesman.
How about some of the people who want the tax laws to be changed?
Jack Kemp, the former Congressman and chairman of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, a private organization that promotes the flat tax, gets assistance, an aide said.
The authors of "The Flat Tax," a book recommending a flat tax rate on business and individuals, both prepare their own taxes. The writers, Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, senior fellows of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, both use tax preparation software.
Robert S. McIntrye, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, an organization that believes the tax system favors the rich, and J. D. Foster, executive director of the conservative Tax Foundation, do their own taxes. Indeed, both men created spreadsheet programs to help. "If I couldn't do my own taxes," Mr. McIntrye said, "I shouldn't be speaking about taxes."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER EAST SIDE;
Fight to Regain School Board Voice

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For 8 of the 20 candidates running for Community School Board 2, there is a missionary fervor: winning representation for the Upper East Side on the board.
But the eight candidates living on the Upper East Side, or with children in the neighborhood's schools, face an uphill struggle for the May 7 election. Nineteen candidates, plus a write-in, are running for nine seats in the sprawling district, Manhattan's most racially diverse. 
 About 5,650 students, about a quarter of the district's children, are in schools above 57th Street or on Roosevelt Island. But the Upper East Side typically turns out only 1,000 or so voters for a board election, which in 1989 attracted 12,000 votes districtwide.
Still, the complex proportional representation system of voting usually insures that one or two Upper East Siders are elected to the nine-member board. But in the last election, in 1993, the Upper East Side turned out the same 1,000 or so votes in an election that attracted 51,000 votes, as gay-rights advocates and their allies fought back conservatives endorsed by the Christian Coalition. Upper East Siders are likely to have a better chance this time around.
Four Upper East Side candidates have children in district schools. Douglas H. Robinson, a Citibank computer programmer, is gay and has two adopted sons. He lives in Washington Heights but has one son at Public School 6 on East 81st Street. Renee Ward, an accountant, has one of her two daughters at P.S. 6. Both Mr. Robinson and Ms. Ward emphasize greater parental control over the district's budget, maintenance of buildings and teacher accountability.
Patricia Sliwak-Grinberg, a housewife, has four children, two of whom attend P.S. 183. Although District 2 has no jurisdiction over high schools, Ms. Grinberg has been pressing for an academic high school on the East Side.
Essie D. Owens, an educational consultant who lives on Roosevelt Island, has her 10-year-old son at P.S. 217. Like Mr. Robinson, who is also black, Ms. Owens wants to boost minority representation on the board.
Mr. Robinson, Ms. Sliwak-Grinberg and Ms. Owens are on the Alliance for Better Community Schools slate, which tends to support the Superintendent, Anthony J. Alvarado, a former city schools chancellor.
Four candidates do not have children in the district. George Spitz, a retired state auditor, has gained a reputation as a gadfly. Robert S. Kelley, a securities analyst and a write-in candidate, also plans to attack wasteful spending. Adolfo Carpio, a computer programmer, wants to encourage more parents to volunteer at their schools. John C. Sovak, an unemployed waiter, said he wanted to apply "modern management science" to the board. ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Buy Britain! Sell Sweden! Hold Hong Kong!

BYLINE: By DOREEN HEMLOCK 

 BODY:
WANT to bet on a recovering economy in another country? Think Germany will soon cut interest rates and drive up that country's stock market? Some new investments make it particularly easy to speculate on just such matters.
The American and the New York stock exchanges recently introduced stock index products for several countries. The issues, which trade like stocks, let investors buy the bulk of a foreign market in one fell swoop, in much the same way as a Standard & Poor's 500 index fund allows one to own most of the United States market. 
 "This is the simplest and most convenient way for most Americans to invest abroad," said Jim Rogers, the author of "Investment Biker" and a financial adviser. "You can tell your broker, 'Instead of buying me I.B.M., buy me Germany or Australia.' "
Not that it was impossible to buy a fund specializing in these areas before. But the choices were mostly closed-end funds, which issue a fixed number of shares and often trade at a discount or a premium to their underlying stock prices. Most closed-end country funds do not track an index but are actively managed, meaning they are run by stock pickers who aim to do better than the broad market.
Along with closed-end funds, some open-end mutual funds specialize in specific countries, but most of those are also actively managed. Open-end funds are priced once a day and can be bought or sold at their net asset values. Among the biggest managers of these funds is Wright Investors' Service, in Bridgeport, Conn., which has nine actively managed open-end country funds. "Our objective is to outperform," said Peter Donovan, chairman of Wright, adding that investors will choose based on performance. "If the index outperforms, they'll buy that."
 Index funds aim to replicate the performance of the broad market by buying all the shares in a stock index and then keeping their expenses low. Only a few foreign funds, including the Vanguard International Equity Index European, now use indexing. Given how Americans have flocked to the concept of index investing at home, the new country index investments -- really a cross between open-end and closed-end funds -- are likely to attract a fair share of fans.
 World Equity Benchmark Shares, or WEBS, made their debut in March on the American Stock Exchange, and come in 17 varieties, each based on a different Morgan Stanley Capital International index. Country Baskets Index Funds, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, come in nine versions, including one for the United States, and are based on Financial Times/Standard & Poor's AWI indexes. Most of the countries covered have relatively large, stable stock markets. You won't find Turkey or Israel in either group -- at least not yet.
"This is the first time you can easily buy an index fund for most of these countries," said Gregg Wolper, who specializes in closed-end funds at Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking firm in Chicago. "Whether that's good or not remains to be seen. It's very possible you could do just as good or better with a closed-end fund."
The biggest impact could well be on the closed-end fund market, which has been in the doldrums, with only a handful of new issues in the last year.
"Since the WEBS and country baskets started, discounts on some closed-end funds have widened," said Thomas Herzfeld, who specializes in closed-end fund investing and is president of an advisory firm bearing his name in Miami. The discount on the Germany Fund has increased to 18 percent from 11 percent in January, he said, and the discount on the Scudder New Europe Fund, which has holdings in France, Germany and the Netherlands, has grown to 20 percent from 10 percent at the beginning of the year.
 "The result is that closed-end funds are currently cheap," Mr. Herzfeld said, "compared to WEBS and country baskets." Investors could reap a nice profit if the price of the closed-end funds moved closer to their underlying values and perhaps a windfall if the funds ever decided to convert to open-end status, issuing new shares.
As an example, look at the Germany fund, a closed-end fund, and the new indexed Germany products. The portfolios are similar. "If the discount narrows, you'll make a lot more money buying the closed-end Germany Fund," said Mr. Wolper of Morningstar. There is no guarantee, however, that a discount will disappear over time.
Some investors have long treated closed-end country funds as something akin to a broad market basket. That's not always the case. Even portfolios with similar holdings may have weighted the stocks differently. At the end of January, the Mexico index for WEBS consisted of 41 stocks, with Telefonos de Mexico at 28.2 percent. The Wright-Equifund Mexico, by contrast, had just 5.5 percent in Telmex at the end of March.
The choice between actively managed funds and index funds is a basic one for investors. Index funds have proved particularly useful for buying large-company stocks in the very efficient stock market in the United States. The markets overseas may not be as efficient because of different accounting rules and difficulties in getting access to information.
For these reasons and others -- like a desire to buy a fund that hedges against currency risk or one that moves into cash in times of political uncertainty -- many investors are willing to pay more for actively managed funds. Average annual expenses on international stock funds are 1.8 percent of assets, versus about 1 percent for WEBS and country baskets. Other costs to consider are brokerage commissions, which apply to WEBS, country baskets and closed-end funds, and sales charges, levied on many international mutual funds.
"The indexes are a low-cost alternative," said George Murnaghan, vice president of Rowe-Price Fleming International, which runs $23 billion in actively managed international funds for T. Rowe Price. "But an investor may not want to have exposure to certain things in an index. They may want to skew their portfolio away from certain companies, like banks in Japan."
Financial advisers generally urge small investors to start with a foreign fund that invests in many nations.
"The single worst investment you can make is in a single-country fund, especially in emerging markets, which are highly volatile and high risk," said Frank A. Fernandez, chief executive of Global Emerging Market Advisors L.P., of New York, a specialist in diversified funds. "And the toughest investment decision to make is 'top down' by country. It's easier to pick individual stocks in individual markets than to follow the political, economic and cultural events that can affect a single-country market."
STILL, some people want to speculate -- at least with a small part of a portfolio -- with a single-country fund.
And large investors may find the products particularly appealing. Money managers and fund companies may buy the country baskets and WEBS for their mutual fund portfolios. One appeal for anyone investing at least $450,000 is the possibility of getting out of WEBS or country baskets by taking the underlying stocks instead of cash. Such redemptions, granted at the issuer's discretion, allow investors to time their gains and losses on specific stocks.
Sophisticated investors many also use the index products for arbitrage, taking advantage of temporary discrepancies in markets. For example, they could sell the index fund short -- a bet that its price will fall -- during New York trading hours and then buy the underlying shares abroad when that market opens if the price indeed falls. They would pocket the difference as a profit. Country baskets can already be sold short when the price is going down; WEBS are seeking authorization to do so. Shorting is rarely possible with funds.
"I think the new indexes will make the markets more efficient," said Gary Evans, senior strategist for fixed income in emerging markets at Lehman Brothers.
Investors in foreign countries may clamor for the new products as well. "You can't buy index funds in most countries of the world," said Mr. Rogers, the investment adviser, "so I suspect these funds also will be a way for foreigners to invest in their own markets."

Housing May Replace Barren Lot

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
On the eastern edge of Brooklyn, in what was once a part of Jamaica Bay and then a city dump for construction debris, a developer is proposing to erect a new neighborhood, including the largest housing development to be built in Brooklyn in the last 20 years.
Along with local churches, Grenadier Realty, a subsidiary of the company that built the huge Starrett City apartment complex in East New York in the early 70's, has proposed to construct more than 1,300 single- and two-family homes as well as a 200 units of apartments for the elderly. The development, Gateway Estates, would have two schools, several parks and a shopping center on a tract bounded by Flatlands Avenue, Fountain Avenue, the Belt Parkway and Hendrix Creek. 
 The city would spend $25 million to build roads, electrical and sewer lines and the other items required for the 227-acre lot and nearly $75 million to subsidize the construction of the homes. Total cost for the development, part of a city urban renewal plan, is estimated at more than $500 million, city housing officials said.
"This is a wonderful site," said Robert C. Rosenberg, senior vice president of Starrett Corporation, Grenadier's parent company. "A vast number of housing units can be built without displacing anyone. There is no controversy here."
Backers of the project, including Borough President Howard Golden, who has already allocated $3.75 million to the proposed development, have argued that it will bring homeowners to a trash-littered lot on the far edge of Brooklyn and generate more than 2,000 jobs. The proposed complex is the largest in Brooklyn since Starrett City, with nearly 6,000 apartments opened in 1974 several blocks to the west, Mr. Golden said.
But at a city Planning Commission hearing this week, environmental groups voiced their opposition to the project. They argued for the preservation of open space that birdwatchers and hikers now use and expressed concerns about methane gas beneath the lot. According to the environmental impact statement, methane has seeped into the soil from years of dumping.
Richard Cogen, a lawyer for the Audubon Society, said that accumulated methane gas can explode. Mr. Rosenberg said the methane would be dissipated during construction and that the houses would be built without basements, to prevent the gas from collecting under the homes. He said the paved roads and clean soil would also protect against the other contaminants lingering underground.
The Planning Commission is to vote on the project on May 6. If it is then approved by the City Council, construction is to begin this fall and is estimated to take about five years.
Under the proposed development, the Starrett Corporation would build 840 two-family homes restricted to families with income of between $35,000 and $70,000 a year. Another 500 single-family homes for families making $21,000 to $65,000 a year will be built by East Brooklyn Congregations, developers of 2,200 row houses in East New York and Brownsville under its Nehemiah Homes project.
The Starrett Corporation has also agreed to build an elementary school for 900 to 1,200 students and an intermediate school for 900. The company proposes to lease the schools to the Board of Education once they are completed. The proposed community would also have a large park around its periphery and three smaller neighborhood parks. SOMINI SENGUPTA

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
On-Line Trading Takes Off

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
CALL your broker! For clients of discount brokerage houses, that phrase may become as old-fashioned as button your shoes.
Since January of last year, the number of discount brokerage companies that provide on-line trading has almost doubled, from 12 to 22, the American Association of Individual Investors says. The firms include large organizations like Quick & Reilly and Fidelity Brokerage Services and smaller concerns like Accutrade and Pacific Brokerage Services. 
 Investors are flocking to sign up. The number of on-line accounts has jumped to 624,000 this year from 412,000 in 1995, Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., estimates. Forrester predicts that 1.3 million accounts will be on line within three years.
Most auspicious of all, beginning in May Charles Schwab & Company, the nation's largest discount broker, will allow investors to trade through its Internet site. This move by Schwab, which already offers on-line trading through Street Smart and e.Schwab, its proprietary software, may help prompt more such offerings among discounters.
"Schwab's reach, in terms of sheer size and the impact it has in the brokerage business, makes this quite significant," said Guy Moszkowski, a securities industry analyst in New York. "Look for more discount brokerages to follow suit."
Investors have three ways to trade on line. The most popular is through a discounter's special software, like Schwab's Street Smart or Fidelity's On-Line Xpress. Some discounters can be reached through on-line services like Compuserve and America Online or through generic modem software like Procomm and Crosstalk. And, as with Schwab's venture, investors can also hook up with some brokerage firms via the Internet. (But don't look for full-service brokers, who offer personalized advice as well as order-taking, to offer any of these methods. So far, only discount and deep-discount brokerage firms have ventured into the area.)
All the on-line discounters execute stock trades and offer their services around the clock. They also provide clients with information about their accounts and offer real-time or delayed stock-price quotations, in some cases for an extra fee.
But the scope and terms of the services vary in other ways. While Fidelity Brokerage Services offers trades in stocks, bonds, mutual funds and options, for instance, smaller companies may handle just stocks and perhaps one other type of security. Most on-line discounters will execute standard buy-or-sell trades and limit orders, in which the investor sets a floor or ceiling for the trade price. And many will execute more exotic transactions like short-selling, in which an investor borrows shares on a bet that a stock's price will decline. Some also execute "versus purchase" orders, through which an investor can specify which lots are being sold to limit tax liability.
Generally, the fees that computerized discounters charge on line are comparable to those for conventional trading. But there are some divergences.
One involves discounts for on-line trading, which is generally cheaper than transactions requiring human brokers. The American Association of Individual Investors says seven on-line brokers offer commission discounts for on-line trading. Aufhauser & Company, Schwab, Jack White, Muriel Siebert and Quick & Reilly offer 10 percent reductions from regular fees. Max Ule offers 20 percent discounts and Freedom Investments has discounts from 10 percent up, depending on the size of the trade.
But on-line traders may encounter special costs. Investors who use Schwab's Street Smart software must pay $38 for it, for example, while Fidelity's On-Line Xpress costs $49.95. Then there are the costs of the on-line computer services. And, just as they do in their off-line businesses, some discounters attach miscellaneous fees to client transactions. E*Trade, for example, charges 27 cents a minute to give clients on-line access to the company.
In choosing on-line brokerage companies, an investor should keep an eye on services, said Andre Scheluchin, managing editor at Mercer Inc., a research firm in New York that tracks the discount-broker industry. If you want research and real-time stock quotes, for instance, look for a firm that provides them at a discount or at no cost.
But be wary about going on line to trade, said John Markese, president of the individual investors association. While many people think that technology somehow makes them better decision makers, he said, the new tools merely get information to them faster. Technology does not make the information better, or investors wiser.

AT the Hilltop Diner, 164-02 Union Turnpike in Fresh Meadows, Queens, you can find a man who for five years now has eaten two meals a day there, seven days a week. You can find out why The Lunch Bunch became The Big Three. You can find out why it's better for management if someone has a few Cokes rather than a swordfish steak. You can find out what it means to order a Greek salad "Deborah's way."
Go to the Hilltop and see life unvarnished, unexpurgated, in need of a cheeseburger deluxe, extra fries. See a menu, ablaze with possibilities, lengthier than a novella. See waitresses with irremovable smiles say, "So what will you have, hon?" See people order a piece of chocolate layer cake and get a towering thing that contains a day's output from a good-sized sugar refinery. You wonder why more dentists don't open next door to diners. 
 Small fleecy clouds were drifting across the city. Union Turnpike was aswarm with honking cars this Monday, and every so often one glided into the Hilltop, open 24 hours a day, every day. Here came a guy with a tumbling shag of red hair carrying an astrology chart and a small telescope. A man and a woman with hurry-up looks. A young guy with a buzzed-up haircut. A woman with a rambunctious child who whined: "I'm not eating. I'm not eating one crumb."
There was, as always, a low murmur going through the place, and the periodic clattering of plates being cleared. This is the small, consoling music of the diner. Smiling, John Morfogen, a co-owner, greeted the arrivals and, radiating sincerity, shunted them to booths. Mr. Morfogen moves constantly, with calm purpose. He listens to a lot of conversations, but since he has heard the same ones for years, he does not listen too closely.
The first diners were actual railroad dining cars plucked off their tracks, but modern diners often look more like space shuttles. The Hilltop is like that -- gleaming, low-slung gray granite with a neon-lighted flat roof.
The diner's animating thesis involves an emotional communion people have with the sterile environment and the sovereign good will. Go there any time and humanity in musing good spirits awaits. Someone in the skewers of a dilemma will often turn first to his succoring waitress. If a repeater fails to appear on schedule, the waitresses call around. Jerry Schnitzer, a social studies teacher who takes breakfast at the Hilltop every morning at 6:45, didn't arrive until 11 one day (waylaid by a doctor's appointment), and the whole staff panicked.
The business benefaction of a diner is that it permits a ceaseless cycle of eating. Diners don't have three meals a day; they have something like 10. They have early-bird dinners, after-the-club snacks, before-movies this, between-classes that, unexpected-rumble-in-my-stomach this. A New York Jets linebacker lumbered in once and had a six-egg omelette, went to an appointment and returned an hour later for an encore six-egg omelette.
"You'd need a henhouse to feed that man," a waitress concluded.

THE GREEK CONNECTION
Both John Morfogen, 61, and Angelo Trombettas, 65, who jointly own the diner, are Greeks, which is to be expected. There is some unwritten stricture that diners must be owned by Greeks. Many of the Greeks who came to this country plowed right into food; it was an easy-entry business. Others mimicked them. Before long, there was scarcely a diner around that didn't feature a Greek salad and chicken souvlaki.
Before the two Hilltop partners became partners, they were total strangers. Mr. Trombettas was born in Chefallonia, Greece, and came to America when he was 21. He began scrubbing dishes in a Pittsburgh restaurant, and eventually owned his own restaurant there. After 20 years, business slackened. In 1988, he sold the place, moved to New York and bought the Hilltop with two partners. A year later, one partner wanted to sell out (the second subsequently took ill and also sold his interest), and John Morfogen happened along.
Mr. Morfogen was born in Anavriti, Greece, and came to Brooklyn with his family when he was 12. Over the years, he worked as a busboy, waiter, cook. Starting in 1954, with his two brothers, he ran the Chelsea Chop and Steak House in Manhattan, following that with other steak and seafood restaurants. The tablecloth business started to contract, and he sold the establishments over a period of years. Through the restaurant grapevine, he got wind of the Hilltop.
The Hilltop dated to 1948, and had been on the decline. Competition had intruded in the form of a Roy Rogers, a fish 'n chips, a pancake house, a pizza place. The new owners renovated the diner. And they went the way of other diners, distancing the Hilltop from the heartlandish, greasy-spoon image by upgrading the menu. Everything but lobster tails, shrimp and french fries is now fresh, and there are plenty of health food and vegetarian offerings. On the menu are dishes like "agnolotti with shrimp and scallops" and "osso buccho of lamb shank Milanese." As always, though, there is the requisite rotating display of artery-clogging desserts just inside the entrance, slowly twirling several trillion calories in a tight circle before your eyes.
"Years ago, the diner catered to the truck driver, the single elderly person," Mr. Morfogen said. "Everything was a cheeseburger and a milkshake. It was a tradition to sit at the counter. Now most people come in with someone else and they eat everything. We had 16 counter seats and I cut back to 7, turning the space into booths for two. We are oriented toward the businessman breakfast special and the family dinner. Listen, 'diner' is a powerful word. It has survived fast food, health food. Nothing stops the diner."

THE REGULARS
It was cool and almost quiet. Throughout the diner sat people in all the attitudes of relaxation. One of the gnostic truths about diners is that they attract authentic characters, people groping for a new center to their lives. For instance, sit down in that booth for two near the kitchen and introduce yourself to Malcolm Heyman.
Mr. Heyman is a sturdily built man of 64 with a high domed forehead and a rubbery look to his face. Regular as a metronome, he shows up at 5:45 each morning to get a take-out breakfast that he delivers to his wife. Then he returns and takes his breakfast alone. He skips lunch to work out at the gym. Each evening at 4:30 he acquires a take-out dinner for his wife, then reappears for his own dinner. He has adhered to this concise regimen 365 days a year for five years.
He spoke with a steadfast smile and a sententious manner. To underscore his points, he stabbed the air with his right index finger. He said his wife eats at home in solitude because she can endure no stress. "She's been through a hectic five years," he explained. "She had two sisters die of cancer. Then our only child had to be placed in a residential center. And I broke down with post-traumatic stress disorder and she's battling cancer."
His twisting account of his own breakdown involves his working at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, teaching hardcore psychiatric patients how to turn castoff wood from the Steinway piano factory into table lamps. It involves a disturbed man living on the streets near Creedmoor coming at Mr. Heyman with a 2-by-4 and tossing rocks at him from behind bushes. The police caught him but Mr. Heyman said he was traumatized by the episodes. Then, he said, supervisors harassed him. He said he wasn't getting his phone messages and mail. His nerves went.
Now he receives workers' compensation. He is often depressed. If he is stationary for long, he said, he falls asleep. So he stays ambulatory. He said he walks for four hours a day. To occupy himself, he collects cans. The proceeds are bet on the stock market. Nickels from Coke cans are plowed into Coca-Cola stock. Pepsi money goes into Pepsi. Money from Master Choice cans (the A.& P. house brand) buys A.& P. stock. Money he finds on the streets he puts into shares of Service Corporation International and Charles Schwab. He said his portfolio hovers around $5,600.
His roast turkey dinner was delivered, and he dug in.
"I like this place," he said, taking a brief, angling look around the diner. "I like a lot of life. There's a lot of life here."

THE BURGERS AND MORE
Nothing is more astounding about diners than the density of their menus. There are 379 items on the Hilltop menu. The most popular choices, forgetting coffee and Coke, are hamburgers, chicken and eggs (omelette is the favored style). The least-ordered selection is meatloaf. Days can lapse without a taker.
Each day, the diner goes through 360 eggs, 250 hamburgers, 40 loaves of bread, 25 pounds of coffee, 3,000 napkins (many are wasted), 180 Cokes. Pastries and cakes are made fresh on the premises. They are sold for two days. The third day, they go to a soup kitchen.
Mr. Morfogen explained diner economics: "The method of pricing I learned is, you take the food cost and then add on double that to get the menu price. So if something costs me $3.25, I charge $10 for it. Overall, you shoot for 10 percent net profit."
Within those broad rules are certain exceptions. Some foods won't bear such markup. Others can handle much more. A Coke gets marked up 10 times its cost. Ditto for anything made of flour, like a pancake. Seafood, with its high cost, can only be doubled. "Coffee you can mark up at least 10 times," Mr. Morfogen said. "The problem is the refills are free. If someone is a heavy coffee drinker, it's costing me."

THE WAITRESS AS V.I.P.
Slow time. Huge thunderheads were coming this way, roiling the sky. Outside the kitchen doors, some waitresses were talking among themselves about diner sociology.
Angela Cestaro, the chirpy head waitress, on why so many patrons request a specific waitress: "People don't like to repeat everything over and over. A regular waitress gets to know if someone takes his coffee light or without sugar. They want their eggs without butter. They want their bagel scooped out. We don't know people by names. We know them by what they eat. The guy with the toasted bagel and two soft-boiled eggs. The woman with the spinach salad without the bagel. You are what you eat here."
"You can make a customer for life by remembering that he doesn't want a pickle," said Barbara McGowan, who has been serving diner food for 13 years.
A case in point is Deborah Fromberg, who, in her words, is "allergic to, like every food on the planet." When she orders, she tells her usual waitress, Lucy Wagner, "I'll have it my way." She knows that Deborah's way means, say, Greek salad with no achovies, no scallions, no onions, no tomatoes and a few extra grape leaves to compensate for what's left out.
Diner waitresses hear the wearisome catalogue of life's encroachments. "In a diner, people want you to speak to them," Ms. Cestaro said. "They want conversation. They want to draw you into their lives. You have to be a psychiatrist, a priest, a mother-in-law. You listen to every story. There is an elderly guy here who was in this morning and he says he wants to kill himself. I say, 'What do you want to do that for? Life is good.' He's in love. The woman doesn't love him. He's 75."
Ms. McGowan had a story: "There was this Russian man and an Indian man. They'd come in here every night for weeks and sit in a booth in the back. Each of them would have steak and several Heinekens. Then they didn't come in for a while. I read in the magazine that the Russian guy was this big Russian spy and had been arrested. Scary. And they were good eaters."
Donald Manes, the Queens borough president who killed himself after becoming implicated in a bribery scandal, used to eat at the diner with regularity. He was in the Hilltop the day he took his life. Detectives later interviewed the staff about his meal.
"He had a fruit cup," Ms. Cestaro said. "Always something light, because he was watching his weight. Even on that last day."

THE BIG THREE
Lunch time. The place was pulsing with customers, their minds fixed on burgers deluxe and club sandwiches. The sizzle of bacon was audible. Steam puffed from the coffee urns. The cooks were bug-eyed, concentrating like clerics as they rhythmically churned out the platters.
Tensions between the waitresses and cooks get dicey when business picks up. A spirit of we're-all-in-this-together can rapidly deteriorate to acid sarcasm. The current waitresses and cooks get along tolerably. A decade ago, the kitchen staff was haughty -- and physically demonstrative. They would hurl things. Ms. Cestaro was struck by two raw eggs. "And I didn't do anything," she said. "But the cook said he couldn't throw them at the head waitress, so he threw them at me."
Only 11:30 and Ms. Cestaro already had a table of 12 teachers. Separate checks.
"You haven't experienced life until you've heard teachers order," Ms. Cestaro said. "They're not like anyone else. Very particular. Very diet-conscious. Very money-conscious. They get a lot out of a waitress."
For instance, the man at the head of the table. He has his coffee not in a china cup but in a cardboard container. He takes skim milk in a glass, and as soon as the glass is set down on the table, he covers it with a napkin. He eats only with plastic forks and spoons. He wants his coleslaw drained. His toast has to be rye and burnt. He insists his habits are not whimsy. He said he once had an infectious disease; now he is scrupulous about what he ingests.
The orders of the teachers in, the requests emerged unbidden.
"Do you have any milk?"
"Little more coffee here."
"I'm waiting on a Diet Coke."
"I need more bread, honey."
The fastidious man at the head of the table had ordered a spinach egg-white omelette, an extra large order of well-done home fries and burnt rye toast. He attacked it with plastic fork and knife.
Two minutes elapsed. Ms. Cestaro was summoned.
"The toast isn't burnt enough," the man declared, "and could I have some more fries?"
Enough with the teachers. Best now to slip into the next-to-last booth along the window and listen to the Big Three. The Big Three have been the Big Three only for a year, having derived from The Lunch Bunch.
They were all women who worked at nearby Queens General Hospital, where they first met in the cafeteria. The food not to their liking, they sought out an alternative and, 15 years ago, seized on the Hilltop. There were 14 at first. They came every day. A reservation sign would go on their table: "The Lunch Bunch."
Retirements and deaths thinned their ranks. Last year they were eight. Now they are three. The contraction has necessitated new nomenclature: "The Big Three." They are Elaine Brown in administration, Sherry Schoenfeld in purchasing and Yetta Maletzky in pathology.
The Big Three seem synecdochic of the diner as a whole: faithful lemmings who have found some hard-to-describe tranquillity here.
Their meals are slight. "We're always dieting," Ms. Brown said. "I have a muffin or a fruit cup. Cottage cheese and jello is a big favorite."
The patter is constant. "We cover the world," Ms. Maletzky said.
"Sometimes the other tables will get concerned," Ms. Brown said. "We do get a little risque. We talk about movies, about politics, about our friends now that they're not here."
Ms. Maletzky said, "Yeah, when you leave, we'll talk about you."
"A big topic is our husbands," Ms. Schoenfeld said. "They're always portrayed in an unfavorable light."
Several years ago, the diner was shuttered for a couple of months after a grease fire. The Lunch Bunch glumly trooped to Roy Rogers. "Oh, remember that?" Ms. Brown said. "It was horrible. Without a doubt, that was one of the worst times in my entire life."

THE SUPPLY GUY
It was now nearly five in the afternoon, a Tuesday. Seymour Gabaeff, the sales representative for Sysco, had merchandise to sell. Hilltop buys from about 15 suppliers. Much of the food comes from Sysco, the largest food supplier to the food services industry. It offers 26,000 different items.
"Someone called the other day and wanted a garden hose," Mr. Gabaeff said. "We had it. They needed it to wash down their garbage cans. We carry sinks. We have lightbulbs."
"O.K., Seymour, how about taking some business," Mr. Morfogen said.
Mr. Gabaeff got out a clipboard and carefully opened up his laptop computer. "I love diners," he said, "because they buy a lot. They have big menus. They're always open. Diners are great."
Mr. Morfogen: "Shrimp. What's your price?"
Mr. Gabaeff: "It's $8.74, same as last time."
"O.K., 50 pounds. Smoked mozarella, half a case. Please don't disappoint me on the smoked mozarella."
"I won't."
"One case of toothpicks for the club sandwiches."
"You want the bigger ones? They're the most popular."
"Yeah."
Mr. Morfogen brought over his Delicatessen Paper and said it was too small: "I can't even wrap an English muffin in it. I can't work with this."
"I have bigger."
"O.K., give me a case. Same price?"
"You're a headache. How can I give you bigger and charge the same price? I tell you, diners give too big a muffin. The portions are too big. People have to carry the stuff home. And I wish some diner would have the guts to make a smaller menu."

'A LOT OF STOMACHS'
Ten-minute break. The uncrowded pre-dinner staticness. John Morfogen sat down and polished off a turkey burger. Out of the corner of his eye, he spied a wad of gum stuck against the outside of the window. He summoned a busboy to remove it.
"This business is difficult because we're dealing with your stomach," he said. "People are very fussy with what they put in their stomach. In a diner, you see a lot of stomachs. So you better know what you're doing."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
If Wall St. Zigs, Find Markets That Zag

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN 

 BODY:
WITH the American stock market becoming more and more skittish, many investors may look abroad for safety. For while overseas investments are often seen as chancy and lucrative, they can also help to lower risk, like any other method of diversifying a portfolio.
The trick is to focus on whether the foreign market tracks the performance of Wall Street; if it does, investing there may not add to an investor's safety. But if the foreign market is only loosely related to the American market -- a relationship called "low correlation" -- an investment there can reduce a portfolio's risk. If American stocks fall, the idea goes, the out-of-sync overseas markets may not go down as far, or may not fall at all. 
 In a new study of such correlations, Smith Barney confirmed one primary and unsurprising pattern of this strategy. Comparing different countries with the United States during two five-year periods, 1986 to 1990 and 1991 to 1995, the researchers found that many developed countries were closely correlated to the American market and many emerging markets were not. With 1.0 indicating the highest possible correlation, for instance, Britain had a 0.60 correlation with the United States market from 1991 to 1995, while Thailand scored just 0.20.
Indeed, some emerging countries, like Peru, Turkey and Venezuela, actually have slightly negative correlations to the United States. That means that when the American market is down, theirs is up.
"There are some markets that move in their own step, no matter what has been going on in the United States," said Leila B. Heckman, the author of the study and Smith Barney's managing director of global asset allocation.
But the Smith Barney study also documented some exceptions to the rule. It identified several countries that although developed, had low correlations with the United States. Despite the close economic links between the two nations, for example, Japan had just a 0.20 correlation to the United States from 1991 to 1995. Italy, Austria and Denmark also had low correlations. In fact, Italy has shown just a 0.07 correlation with the United States in the last five years, the study said.
For investors who want to reduce their reliance on the American market but worry about investing in risky emerging countries, these four nations might provide a safer alternative.
But don't overdo it. The best way to lower a portfolio's risk is to invest in the emerging markets, which over all have the lowest correlation with the market in the United States, said George Foot, a partner with Newgate Management Associates.
"The broad brush of the low correlation is not in the developing markets, it's in the emerging markets," Mr. Foot said.
But, the study found, there are a few emerging nations that have high correlations with the United States. These include countries like Argentina and Hong Kong, with currencies pegged to the dollar. For investors looking to lower the risks of domestic exposure, these countries should be avoided.
But investors should know that the correlation tactic has always had a defect: In bad times, the linkages among markets get stronger. When the American market crashed in October 1987, for example, markets fell around the globe. Markets also move more closely together during periods of international crisis, like the Persian Gulf war, and during recessions, like the one in the early 1990's.
In other words, just when American investors may be looking for markets that are only loosely related to theirs, the markets of the world draw closer together.
For that reason, the Smith Barney study also looks at correlations during worrisome economic times -- specifically, when monetary conditions in the United States are getting tighter. That focus is particularly timely today, with interest rates continuing to rise. In fact, Smith Barney's "monetary pressure" index, which measures short- and long-term rates, turned negative on April 5 for the first time since January 1995. This may indicate that the monetary environment is turning adverse, Ms. Heckman said. In 1987, the index turned negative in April and did not turn positive until November, a month after the crash.
In this part of the study, Smith Barney looked at all those periods, from 1986 through 1995, when monetary policy was tightening in the United States. Then the researchers figured out the correlations of other countries to the American market during those periods. The idea: if investors look for countries that have low correlations in such adverse times, they may be able to avoid that perennial defect of the correlation strategy.
And, as it turns out, there are a good number of both developed and emerging markets that have had low correlations with the United States during times of monetary tightening. That is true even if one looks only at the countries that show low correlations at other times as well. Among them: the developed countries of Austria, Italy and Japan had correlations of 0.42, 0.40 and 0.36, respectively, during times of tight money. And among emerging countries, Colombia had a correlation of 0.04 and Taiwan had one of 0.45.
Of course, an investor must also evaluate the foreign market to see if it appears sound, whatever its correlation might be. If an investor has the jitters over the recent tensions between China and Taiwan, for example, he or she might want to skip putting assets into either.
Investing in an emerging market will not necessarily lower risk, said R. Sheldon Johnson, a managing director for equities at Morgan Stanley. Indeed, "an individual country on its own may give you higher risk," he said.
Over all, how would the correlation strategy translate into a real portfolio? The answer will vary from investor to investor. But generally, "to be well-positioned and well-diversified, an investor would have 10 to 20 percent of his portfolio outside the United States, and have emerging market exposure, especially in those emerging markets that are not closely tied to the dollar, and have some exposure to Japan," Ms. Heckman said.
Some experts quarrel with the "top down" direction of the correlation tactic, though. While some analysts say investors should pick their countries and then choose good companies within them, these experts say that good companies will thrive anywhere, even in a country with an unimpressive economy.
Ms. Heckman believes countries matter most, especially in emerging nations, where the biggest companies make up such large portions of the stock market's capitalization that they are, effectively, the market.
"The Telmexes of the world are going to be very closely correlated with the Mexican market," she said, alluding to that nation's giant telephone company.

It was the battle of the cliches last week on Wall Street: "What goes up must come down" vs. "You can't miss with stocks." The "can't miss" theory got a resounding vote on word that we keep pouring staggering sums into mutual funds. Watch the superlatives pile up: the first quarter's $80 billion take shattered the previous record, with the $72 billion that went into stock funds exceeding the total for 1995's first seven months. Still, come down the market did, relentlessly -- with no big next-day bouncebacks, like soothing hot chocolate, to make it all better. What's happening? "Inflation!" cried the doomsayers, while optimists pointed, yet again, at the aging-baby-boomer savings juggernaut. Irresistible force, meet immovable object.
 
SUBSISTENCE
A 'Living Wage,' Locally
It's called the "minimum" wage -- a name that's more appropriate by the day. Inflation so eroded this base wage in the 80's that even if the Clinton team manages to cajole it up to $5.15 an hour from $4.25, it'll buy less than it did in the 70's. But now this battle has gone local, to cities like Baltimore, and has a new name, the "living wage" movement. Baltimore now demands that companies with city contracts pay at least $6.10 -- it goes to $6.60 in July -- and more than 30 other cities are also looking for ways to do at the local level what Congress has not seen fit to do nationwide. Baltimore's rule affects few workers, though, so living-wage advocates are calling for broader local action.
 
THE TOBACCO WARS
Smoking Documents?
The Great Tobacco Wars are marked by a lot of facts, a lot of haze. Here's a fact: the F.B.I. just got some documents. After that, the haze descends. Some lawyers say they are Philip Morris documents, the executive who'd squirreled them away begs to differ, and Philip Morris calls their release a "bizarre stunt." If they're the real thing, they just might provide a -- pardon the expression -- smoking gun on one smoldering issue: whether tobacco companies manipulated nicotine levels. A lawyer said one note read: "determine minimum nicotine drop to keep normal smokers hooked." It was, he said, dated Feb. 1, 1965 -- soon after the landmark Surgeon General's report, as Philip Morris was trying to design low-tar cigarettes.
 
On other fronts, a Mayo Clinic study suggested that when alcoholics smoke, it's the cigarettes that are more likely to kill them. Marlboro will be named to the Marketing Hall of Fame, the first tobacco product to get that honor. And R.J. Reynolds is gambling on a nearly smokeless cigarette.
 
FOLLOW THE FORTUNE
Duke, Father and Daughter
Speaking of tobacco, James Buchanan Duke and his daughter are both in the news. The daughter you know all about: Doris Duke, whose $1.2 billion estate has been a battleground since her death in 1993. Last week came a tentative settlement in which Bernard Lafferty, the butler-come-lately who'd been living in her mansions and jetting about in her plane, would get millions but no longer rule the roost. And her father, "Buck" Duke? Well, he's the one who made that fortune, as the turn-of-the-century founder of American Tobacco, the colossus that dominated the industry until the trust-busters got at it in 1911. His rough-and-tumble story is told in detail in "Ashes to Ashes," by Richard Kluger, a history of the tobacco wars just out from Alfred A. Knopf.
 
THE AGE OF PLASTIC
Farewell, Loose Change?
Watch out. They're trying to make our lives easier again. Who's "they"? Well, this time it's Citibank, Chase, Mastercard and Visa, which last week offered to let the world try cash that's been computer-imbedded in a plastic card. Just swipe it through some machine, you're $1.78 poorer, and the store is $1.78 richer. Why? Faster sales, more sales to those not endowed with exact change, fewer bank tellers -- the list goes on. But think of small rituals lost: the math lessons for schoolchildren in figuring change, the triumph of pointing out that you've been shortchanged, the moral dilemma -- keep it, or give it back? -- when you get too much. And as one citizen, echoing the lament of the plastic-carrying masses, put it, "Why do I need another card?"
 
ROARING FOR DOLLARS
Numbers, Hollywood Style
The numbers boggle the mind -- but it is Hollywood, after all. When Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney in 1994, it seems, he expected 2 percent of the profits from all those money machines like "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Lion King." Hollywood heavyweights normally work these things out in whispers, but there is apparently such bad blood between Mr. Katzenberg and Michael Eisner, Disney's boss, that they couldn't. So Mr. Katzenberg sued last week, saying those profits now exceed $12.5 billion -- which puts his 2 percent at, yes, $250 million. A lion's ransom indeed.
 
DEVELOPER PLUS
Building for Real People
A socially conscious real estate developer. Hmmm. Sounds like an oxymoron. But then there's James W. Rouse, who died last week at 81. He "did more to revitalize American cities than anyone this century," said Donna Shalala, Health and Human Services Secretary. How? For one thing, he created Columbia, Md., a city designed to carve some order out of the chaos of postwar sprawl. And he invented the idea of inner-city "festival marketplaces" by creating Boston's Faneuil Hall, which counts South Street Seaport among its numerous offspring. But he was proudest of his late-in-life efforts to offer affordable housing, with his Enterprise Foundation building more than 40,000 units. Through it all, he had one passion: he watched people walk, talk and shop; he wanted real people to live in places he built. What a quaint idea.
 
FUEL EFFICIENCY
Some Guzzle, Some Don't
The fuel-efficiency news was all over the map last week. At one extreme, the Energy Department said it expected gasoline demand to set records this summer. One culprit is Americans' bizarre infatuation with gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. (Do ads picture them in odd, wild places because they're searching desperately for gas stations?). Another is higher speed limits (because faster driving erodes efficiency). At the far side of the map, Honda introduced a new electric vehicle, to appear in California in the spring of '97 -- the first to use nickel-metal hydride batteries. It says this advanced technology greatly improves range, though the Honda EV still goes just 125 miles on a charge. The price, a big sticking point as electrics yearn for actual buyers, was not disclosed.

The $1 Billion Cure For Civic Insecurity

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
THE nation's cities are desperate in their courtship of baseball and football teams. Downtown revival, tourism, tradition, civic pride -- whatever the reasons, they have pleaded and wheedled and offered the owners the world to make themselves at home.
Now New York City has trumped them all. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his aides spent much of last week touting a proposal to build the Yankees a new baseball stadium on the West Side of Manhattan -- at a cost, from $800 million to $1 billion, even more staggeringly out of the ball park than the average slugger's salary. 
 And as commonplace as superlatives may be in New York, that has raised a fundamental question, with profound public policy implications: Is the city nuts?
Not at all, the Mayor says. He has not only taken up a consultant's recommendation that the city and state build the stadium, but also insists it can be done with very little taxpayer money. He says he will be happy to debate the Democrats who would make it a campaign issue. And while neither the Mayor nor the Yankees' principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, has publicly declared an intention to abandon the team's home in the Bronx, it appears that many developers and business leaders are behind him.
 
 
 
Dismal Scientists
 But as the game of musical stadiums forces cities to open their coffers to team owners, experts on stadium finance have largely concluded that the new ball parks are not worth their price -- at least in the strict equation of economic development.
For all the attention they get, they say, teams like the Yankees remain small businesses -- and extra-small employers compared to any large corporation or manufacturer. A report by the city's Comptroller estimated that the Yankees and the related business they bring into New York generated about $5 million a year in tax revenues, a mere drop in the city's $32 billion budget.
And yet cities are willing to dole out millions of dollars in subsidies -- often far beyond those given to other businesses -- not only to build new stadiums but to keep them running year to year.
"It's better than building a pyramid, but not much better," said Roger G. Noll, a professor of economics at Stanford University and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who argues that cities only stand to lose money on municipally funded stadiums.
But to hear the Mayor tell it, the city and state have no choice but to do all they can to keep Mr. Steinbrenner from acting on his thinly veiled threats to move to New Jersey or beyond -- and, Mr. Giuliani hints, thereby plunge New York into darkness and despair.
"It's economic, but it's more than economic," said Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, the agency overseeing plans for a new stadium not just for the Yankees, but the Mets. "It's psycho-economic."
Mr. Giuliani even says that the losses of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants in baseball and the Giants and Jets in football have come to symbolize the city's "virulently anti-business attitude" going back four decades. Indeed, it was four decades ago that a Mayor last lost a baseball team, and Mr. Giuliani emphatically does not want to be remembered for the same thing.
The Mayor said on Friday that a new stadium -- he favors a retractable dome and room for football, conventions and other events -- would reverse the decline. "We should be a city that thinks about expansion, not a city that thinks about contraction," he said on his weekly radio show.
Opponents of a new stadium have nonetheless seized on the economists' arguments. Mr. Giuliani's political rivals have said the city should offer to renovate Yankee Stadium if need be, as the Lindsay Administration agreed to do in the 1970's, but resist Mr. Steinbrenner's entreaties -- even if he moves to New Jersey as a result.
Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx said it was crazy to pay such a large price -- for reasons the Administration has not been able to explain, a new stadium is estimated to cost three to four times as much as the highly praised new ball parks in Baltimore and Cleveland -- for some intangible benefits to the city's ego.
"When you have schools crumbling throughout the city, roadways and bridges in disrepair, parks and playgrounds in dangerous shape, it's difficult to provide a rationale for spending almost a billion dollars just for the vanity," Mr. Ferrer said.
While the Mayor has acknowledged the need for at least some public spending for roads and mass transit, he says bonds could be repaid with a mother lode of revenues from increased attendance, concessions and advertising -- although Mr. Steinbrenner has his eye on those as well, and most independent experts are doubtful that such increases would materialize.
 
 
 
The Brooklyn Example
 Mr. Giuliani, a famously nostalgic Yankees fan who can recount games he has attended since his boyhood in Brooklyn, has also appealed to history. He argues that Walter O'Malley absconded with the Dodgers because Mayor Robert F. Wagner resisted his demand for city land.
The Dodgers' departure in 1957 did hurt the borough's pride. It is harder to argue, as the Mayor does, that it precipitated an economic decline, which certainly stemmed far more from the flight of manufacturers and the middle class. And politically, the move had little effect. A month after Mr. O'Malley announced his team would leave, Mr. Wagner handily won re-election. (Four years later, he won a third term.)
Arthur T. Johnson, a professor of political science at the University of Maryland in Catonsville and the author of a book on cities' efforts to attract minor league baseball, said that civic boosters tend to overrate the effects of new stadiums. He noted that Camden Yards has created a lot of civic enthusiasm but not an urban miracle. "There's a bar or two that are doing better," he said, "but they were already there."
Mr. Johnson nonetheless said the Mayor was right to say there would be intangible benefits. "Now," he said, "whether it's worth a billion dollars . . . ."

In British Race, Blair Fits Bill

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
POLITICIANS in Britain sometimes look to the United States the way New Yorkers look to California -- to peer into the possible future. With a mixture of fascination and dread, they train their telescopes on the horizon and wonder which trends of public fickledom will blow their way and which newfangled techniques can be lifted for their own campaigns.
Thus, John F. Kennedy's victory in 1960 augured well for Labor, the Democrats' natural affiliate here, and his "New Frontier" seemed to find an echo in Harold Wilson's 1964 campaign pledge to forge a new prosperous era through the "white heat of technology." 
 In 1992, President George Bush's defeat brought gloom to the Conservatives of Prime Minister John Major, who had sent some Tory strategists to lend him a hand. By the same token, Mr. Clinton's win buoyed the hopes of Labor -- starving in opposition ever since Margaret Thatcher's election in 1979 -- that their day might soon be at hand.
Among the Laborites who crowded into a ballroom at London's Dorchester Hotel to celebrate the inauguration of Mr. Clinton, none were happier than a group of young Turks in the party called "modernizers." In the same way that Mr. Clinton as Governor of Arkansas had helped create a more conservative and popular wing of the Democratic Party, they were prodding Labor to turn its back on a tradition of trade union domination and socialist egalitarianism. This old-time religion, they calculated, offended the country's swing voters among middle-class English, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory time and time again.
This process -- of moving the Labor Party to the mainstream of British life -- was called "Clintonization" and its prime practitioner, who took over the mantle of party leadership when John Smith died of a heart attack in 1994, was Tony Blair. Last week Mr. Blair sat in the White House as a guest of President Clinton while on a trip to New York and Washington to bolster his international credentials.
 
 
 
Campaigns Ahead

Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair have met before (at the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin in Israel and during a Presidential visit here last November), but this was their first opportunity for substantive talks. At some point, surely, their conversation turned to politics, since each of them is effectively at the beginning of a campaign. Mr. Clinton's contest in November against Senator Bob Dole will likely come first, because Mr. Major is able to put off the showdown with Mr. Blair until May 1997, though he retains the option of calling a snap election before then.
In both countries, the campaigns will play out against an uncertain economic background. In Britain, as in the United States, economic growth has been restored and both inflation and unemployment are low (the British figures are 2.7 percent and 7.9 percent respectively). But, again as in the United States, economic insecurity is rife, thanks to downsizing and corporate benefit-trimming. The Conservatives' main hope is to institute a dramatic tax cut in the next budget to reinforce their image as the cost-conscious party that keeps money in the pockets of wage-earners.
One major difference between the two contests, of course, is that Mr. Clinton is the incumbent and Mr. Blair is the challenger. Superficially at least, the candidates are somewhat alike, fast-talking men able to sketch out a vision of the way things should be, running against opponents who embody stolid virtues of the status quo and do not arouse much excitement on the stump.
 
 
 
Parallel Lives
 Mr. Blair, 43, is resolutely middle class; his father was a barrister, he went to a private secondary school in Scotland and then to St. John's at Oxford (where the Mr. Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar). From his student days in a rock group, he still plays the acoustic guitar (compared with Mr. Clinton's saxophone). He lives in a Victorian house in Islington (London's equivalent of the Upper West Side), favors pinstriped suits and is married to a high-powered barrister, Cherie Booth, who was recently made a Queen's Counsel, a member of the profession's inner sanctum. Already the Tory press is trying to draw a comparison to Hillary Rodham Clinton, which does not seem to fit but has forced Mr. Blair to insist that she would play no role whatsoever in his government.
In some ways -- his clean-cut looks, his Oxbridge accent and a to-the-manor-born confidence -- Mr. Blair seems more appropriate as a Tory leader than Mr. Major, now 53 but so heavily gray that he seems years older. The Prime Minister still carries the flat, unpretentious accent of suburban South London where he was raised; his parents were once variety-show performers who went into the garden ornament business, and he lacks a university degree. A fundamentally decent and modest man who is charming in a small group, he is not an instinctive politician and he has failed to ignite enthusiasm in the country at large, suffering the successor syndrome in the wake of Mrs. Thatcher much as Mr. Bush did following Ronald Reagan. He is behind in the polls, by over 20 points in all surveys, and is widely expected to lose. Last week the Conservatives lost a by-election, reducing their majority in Parliament to a single vote.
If Mr. Blair has an Achilles' heel, it's one he shares with Mr. Clinton. As conciliators and reformers who have moved their parties from traditional positions and ignored some traditional constituencies, both are charged by critics with lacking in bedrock convictions. Mr. Blair, who has praised the single-mindedness of Mrs. Thatcher's vision and has backed away from ideological pledges, is sometimes called Tony Blur by his detractors.
In an interview before leaving for the United States, Mr. Blair denied that the problems of the Clinton Administration in passing some of its programs served as a "negative role model," asserting that the American Constitution often forces the President to negotiate with Congress to get legislation passed. "It's not like here, where you get a government elected that has a majority in the House of Commons, that proposes legislation and then just pushes it through."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Your Tax Cut Is in the Mail . . .

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
INCOME taxes are due tomorrow, and tonight many of you will labor at the dining-room table, awash in old mortgage statements, pecking at the calculator, cursing silently at the insatiable Federal maw. Then you'll write us a check.
But we in the Government want you to know that relief is on the way. Soon, we are going to cut your taxes. 
 Yes, yes; we said that in 1992. And in 1994. This time we mean it.
Our Republicans have promised, at last count, $200 billion in cuts over seven years -- a $500-a-child tax credit for working folk; breaks for adoptions, retirement, small business. President Clinton pledges $117 billion in givebacks -- a child credit; small business breaks; dispensations for college education, health care and retirement.
"Give the American people their balanced budget, a tax cut, lower interest rates and a brighter future!" he exhorted in January, in his State of the Union address. This is the least we can do, the Republicans reply. But first, about that budget.
Because we are giving some much-needed relief to you, the average American, we will have a little less money for us, the Government, to spend. Nine, maybe 10 billion dollars a year, on average, as the President reckons it, more under the Republican plan. But we doubt you will feel a thing.
Transportation might be a good place to trim. Mr. Clinton cut bus and subway subsidies earlier in his term, and now Republicans want to as well. Local transit agencies will lose some grant money, of course, and they may have to hike fares or cut service. That is what they did in 1995, anyway; New York City's fares rose 25 cents, and the subway here in Washington cost a dime more. Over a 48-week work year -- four weeks off, right? -- 25 cents each way is a measly, lessee . . . $120. Heck, most of you don't even ride the train.
 
 
 
Go for Education
 Of course, wiping out transit subsidies altogether would only save $2 billion a year, hardly enough to finance even the "modest" tax reduction that Mr. Clinton supports. But huge chunks of the Government's domestic spending consists of grants to the states and other pass-throughs.
Cutting Education Department grants to school districts, most of them in low-income areas, would save $7 billion or more. Job-training programs, mostly grants, eat up $4.4 billion of Mr. Clinton's 1997 budget. Maybe these could go.
Many public schools do lean heavily on Federal aid to educate the poor; they could raise property taxes instead, assuming that residents of low-income districts can pay them. Wealthier districts will not find this a problem, and for most of you it wouldn't be more than a few hundred dollars a year.
The loss of job-training programs conceivably could push a few more workers onto the welfare rolls. But plans are to shift many welfare duties to the states anyway; this is their citizens' problem.
We in Government spent scads of money last year -- hundreds of millions of dollars -- insuring mortgages and guaranteeing home loans for certain people, like young families, that lack terrific credit or a big down payment. Curbing these programs would save us money. Of course, it would raise borrowing costs for those families; raise an 8.5 percent mortgage on a $100,000 loan by one point, and it racks up $25,920 in additional payments over 30 years.
No doubt you know some of these programs have already been trimmed, that others are politically sacrosanct, and that further deep cuts, much less abolition, are a chancy thing. Sadly, this may be true.
"Where are we after a year's bloodletting?" in the Republican-Democratic spending wars, Robert O. Reischauer, the Brookings Institution scholar and former congressional budget guru, asked last week. "Nowhere," he answered.
So a tax cut might better be paid for from the big pots of money -- like Medicare, Medicaid and such. Siphoning $10 billion from the $260 billion a year poured into Medicare and Medicaid would be a piece of cake, except that both programs also face major cost-cutting as part of the deficit-reduction program.
 
 
 
Old Complainers
 We in Government could pay for your tax cut by raising Medicare premiums by, say, $200 a year, but the elderly would protest. Or we could raise from 1.45 percent to 1.6 percent the payroll tax that swells Medicare's hospital trust fund; that would raise the bite on a $50,000-a-year salary from $725 to $800. It would be easier to reduce Government payments to doctors and hospitals that treat Medicare and Medicaid patients, and let them pass on the cost to other patients; how would they ever know?
The truth, however, is that benefit programs are even harder to cut than ordinary domestic spending. Witness this year's budget battle, in which Congress and Mr. Clinton failed to agree on a single spending reduction in a major entitlement program.
We could always finance your tax cut painlessly, as we have for decades, by adding to the Federal deficit. All right, not entirely painlessly: a $10 billion loan to the Treasury at 5.5 percent simple interest would cost $550 million a year before the first penny of principal was retired, and we would have to borrow another $9 billion or $10 billion every year.
A lot of economists argue that this kind of borrowing also saps productivity, by soaking up money that would otherwise be spent to update factories and educate workers, and thus lowers our standard of living. And they say it pushes up interest rates by reducing the amount of money available for other loans, thereby making everything more costly. Indeed, this is why we wanted to get the deficit down to zero to begin with.
You may be getting the impression that a tax cut is a lot like Bat Day at the ball park: an apparent freebie whose cost actually is tacked on to the hot dogs or the stadium parking or the souvenir program. You may think that there is no free lunch.
Well, you are wrong. There is one painless way to pay for a tax cut. It consists of eliminating pork in that packinghouse of political largess, the Federal highway program. We spend $19 billion a year to help states build roads. We shall cut it in half.
Granted, that is a bit stiff. Some states might raise income taxes to offset the loss, and many would probably pare back repairs and construction.
But a few more potholes or traffic jams would be little bother. Heck, most of you can take the train anyway.

HEADLINE: Ruling in Price-Fixing Case Provides a Look at Drug Industry

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Providing a look at rarely publicized internal discussions in the pharmaceutical industry, a Federal judge has quoted from sealed industry documents that compare the industry to a cartel, or "kind of an OPEC," which, the judge said, shared information on pricing and competition.
Judge Charles P. Kocoras of Federal District Court in Chicago included the remarks in a 76-page decision he issued last week in ordering a trial of drug manufacturers in a lawsuit brought by independent retail pharmacies. They are accusing 22 drug manufacturers of illegally conspiring to fix prices by offering discounts to health maintenance organizations and others but not to retail pharmacies. 
 The drug companies deny any wrongdoing. They say the retailers do not get the discounts because pharmacies do not influence sales volume and market share.
Lawyers for the pharmacies said hundreds of documents detailing industry practices had been produced since the first class-action suit was filed in October 1993. All these documents are sealed, but Judge Kocoras quoted from a number of them.
The judge said it was "unquestionable" that the companies "had the opportunity to conspire." He added that there was "evidence of seminars and trade association meetings, which virtually every defendant attended at one time or another, and a coordinated exchange of pricing and other competitive information shared among the manufacturers."
An internal memorandum from the files of Abbott Laboratories alluded to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group, as "kind of an OPEC" -- the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The writer, who was not identified, was summarizing a discussion about whether to provide discounts to mail-order drug distributors.
The first participant "that breaks away from the cartel will reap the maximum advantage," the Abbott memorandum said. It added, "Of course, we do not want to be perceived by our brethren on the P.M.A. as black sheep."
Judge Kocoras said, "Such evidence supports the plaintiffs' notions of manufacturer interdependence."
A spokesmen for Abbott declined to comment.
Abbott Laboratories quit the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association in 1993. Abbott did not respond to a request to explain its departure, and a spokesman for the trade group, now called the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association of America, also declined to comment on the case or on Abbott's decision to quit the group.
At a follow-up hearing on Thursday, Judge Kocoras indefinitely postponed the trial date and invited lawyers to comment on his ruling of April 4, when he ordered the trial. Lawyers for the manufacturers said they would ask the judge to allow an immediate appeal, based on his dismissal from the case of six drug wholesalers. At the same time, he also threw out a proposed $408.9 million settlement of the suit.
The judge said in his ruling that the independent pharmacies could seek damages from the manufacturers even though wholesalers supplied 80 percent of their drugs. Some lawyers said the class-action case could collapse if a higher court rejected this interpretation.
The retail pharmacies say they are entitled to the same type of discounts on drugs that health maintenance organizations and hospitals get. A recent study by an economist at the University of Minnesota, Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, said that giving such discounts to retailers could expand competition and reduce prices to consumers by 12 percent.
Chain drugstores, which have filed a separate suit accusing the manufacturers of price discrimination, said their case would not be affected. "Nothing happened in Thursday's hearing that reduces the strength of the evidence," said Phil Schneider, a spokesman for the National Association of Chain Drugstores.
Judge Kocoras also quoted from other documents from the manufacturers' files. For example, he said, a Ciba-Geigy memorandum on Sept. 4, 1985, concerned requests for discounts by retail-pharmacy buying groups.
"It would be hoped that all drug companies would reject these offers," the Ciba memorandum said. Replying the next day, a second Ciba memorandum called the issue a "potentially dangerous situation," and asked, "Is the P.M.A. taking steps to assure that companies are united on this issue, and can we put pressure on them toward this end?"
Rich Salem, a spokesman for Ciba, said the documents were "written by low-level field force personnel who neither understood nor directed Ciba pricing policies."
Some defendants, Judge Kocoras said, "strive to distinguish their pricing policies from the other defendants," and others "claim they were either not present or were not involved during critical meetings at which allegedly 'conspiratorial conduct' occurred."
He quoted from statements that appeared to undermine some of the company arguments: Abbott Laboratories listed "the power of retail pharmacies first" among market forces that "could negatively affect Abbott's market share and margins." Similarly, Lilly listed pharmacists first among people who are not doctors who would significantly influence decisions on prescription drugs in the 1990's.
And a January 1992 memorandum by the Searle unit of the Monsanto Company said that chain drugstores "can have a significant influence over dispensing Searle products."
A Merck & Company memorandum said the 368-store Big B Inc. pharmacy chain, based in Birmingham, Ala., had "the determination, the financing, the ability to shift market share" that would justify offering them Merck's special managed care "initiative." A spokesman for Merck declined to comment.
Janice Toran, a Searle lawyer, said that at this stage in the process: "The judge must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. We remain confident that the court will find that we did not engage in illegal pricing when it makes its decision on the merits."

HEADLINE: Face-Off;
North Korea Wouldn't Invade the South, Would It?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
EVERY evening, South Korean soldiers rake some beautiful white beaches, smoothing out the sand from one end to the other. It is not to make it prettier, for no one is allowed in the area at night: the point is to be able to check for footprints in the morning to see if a new Korean War is breaking out.
These days, the beaches are being raked more carefully than ever. Three times this month, heavily armed North Korean troops entered the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, violating the terms of the armistice that has kept the peace since the end of the Korean War. 
 The incursions have also triggered a furious debate within American intelligence circles. The clear majority view, and the one that most top American officials subscribe to, is that North Korea would not be so foolish as to launch a suicidal attack on the South. The minority view is at the other extreme: these Government analysts argue that North Korea may be trying to desensitize the West to incursions in preparation for a major invasion in the coming months.
Yet even though policy makers subscribe to the majority view, and do not believe the North will attack, they worry enough that President Clinton has adjusted his schedule to extend talks with South Korean leaders during a visit to South Korea on Tuesday. While many believe that an invasion is highly unlikely, they also realize that they cannot afford to be wrong -- and the starting point for North Korea watchers is that no one really knows what is going on there.
 
 
 
Run, DMZ
 Everybody has a good reason for North Korea not invading: it would lose -- although it is not clear whether the North realizes this. Motivations for why it might invade are trickier and mostly have to do with its disastrous economic situation. The fear is that North Korea might attack in a desperate gamble to avoid collapse, perhaps even to force negotiations with the United States leading to a peace treaty and normalized political and trade relations.
"We worry that in a very short period, this country will either collapse or take aggressive actions against the South in a desperate attempt to divert attention from its internal situation," Gen. Gary E. Luck, the top American commander in South Korea, told Congress last month. "It is entirely possible that the leadership in Pyongyang is not, or will not remain, cohesive enough to make rational decisions."
For all the disagreement about the likelihood of war, there is a consensus about how it would begin. The North would infiltrate some of its 80,000-strong special forces into areas of South Korea far from the front lines, American and South Korean military experts say. The commandos would arrive by hovercraft, light planes, submarines and boats, and that is why the South Koreans still rake some beaches to check for footprints -- although these days they look more for radar images of infiltrators.
 
 
 
Havoc
 These elite North Korean troops would proceed to attack command posts, destroy American and South Korean military aircraft and create havoc in South Korea. At about the same time, North Korea would launch a huge artillery barrage against South Korean and United States military forces, as well as key Government ministries in Seoul. South Korea has the misfortune of having a capital just 30-odd miles south of the border.
North Korean tanks and trucks would also be expected to pour across the border. The southern side of the border is very well-defended with antitank ditches, concrete walls and other barriers, though, forcing North Korean tanks into narrow "killing zones" where South Korean and American forces would focus their firepower.
To avoid these South Korean defenses, North Korea's infantry would use tunnels dug by its army underneath the border. So far four tunnels have been found, the deepest 450 feet beneath the surface, but South Korean experts say that based on accounts by defectors they believe there are about 20 more such tunnels. Intelligence analysts estimate that just the four tunnels discovered so far would allow 10,000 troops per hour to enter South Korea.
To slow any invaders, South Korean bridges and roads either have explosives built in or have places for explosives to be inserted and detonated quickly. Huge rock fields have been built above key roads, so that an explosive can send boulders hurtling down to block the roads.
North Korean engineering teams would be charged with clearing the roads and fording the broad Imjin River to get to Seoul. Apparently with Seoul in mind, the North Korean Army has devoted considerable resources to river-crossing units, for it has 600 amphibious vehicles and 2,300 prefabricated sections for bridges.
The North Korean aim, military officers say, would be to capture Seoul in a blitzkrieg attack, before American reinforcements could arrive from Japan, Europe and the United States. One other way North Korea might try to slow reinforcements would be to attack American air bases in Japan, possibly with missiles.
Although North Korea may have a couple of nuclear weapons, it is not clear how they could be delivered, and American planners are more worried by the North's 1,000-ton stockpile of chemical weapons.
"I think you would probably see the first major use of chemical agents since World War I," said an American military expert who is in the minority predicting a strong chance of war. "If they were to decide to depopulate Seoul before taking it, they could probably do it with very little defense on our part."
 
 
 
Certain Defeat
 Still, American planners say that the United States and South Korea would quickly establish air and naval superiority. Most say that North Korea would be a far more credible opponent than Iraq was in the Gulf war, but there is virtual unanimity that in the end the North Korean regime would be destroyed. North Korea's invasion scenario now is not so different from the one that played out in 1950, when it launched the Korean War -- except that now South Korea has a formidable army, backed by the United States. And this time, China -- which is no longer particularly friendly to North Korea and even has border disputes with it -- almost certainly will not send its army to rescue the North when it gets in trouble.
That is the best argument for presuming that North Korea will not invade: it would be suicide. But does the North know that?
"The problem is not that North Korea can defeat us, but that they think they can," said the American Government expert who worries about an invasion soon. This official, like some others, is afraid that the North Koreans will find the alternative -- not invading -- also suicidal. Almost everyone believes that North Korea is on a trajectory toward collapse.
"The situation for the regime in North Korea is not sustainable, because their economy and their agriculture are continuing to get worse and worse, and then they had those horrible floods last summer," said Col. John W. Reitz, a spokesman for the American forces in Korea. "The end for that regime is in sight; we just don't know when."
 
 
 
Conflicting Signals
 One cause for concern is that North Korea last fall repositioned heavy guns and military aircraft closer to the border. One group of Il-28 bombers now can reach Seoul in just six minutes.
There are also many contrary signals: North Korea's military exercises have been at an unusually low level in recent months, and satellites have spotted no unusual mobilizations of North Korea's 1.2 million-member armed forces. On the other hand, its troops are already massed on the border, and so American military planners worry that they might not have much warning before their radar screens began lighting up with incoming missiles and artillery shells.

HEADLINE: Key Mandela Aide to Join Group Promoting Investment by Blacks

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, April 13

 BODY:
Cyril Ramaphosa, widely considered a possible successor to President Nelson Mandela, said today that he would be leaving the South African Government to become a senior executive in a business conglomerate.
The move would appear to enhance greatly the position of a Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki, as front- runner for the post-Mandela presidency. Some of Mr. Ramaphosa's supporters were quick to point out that he could make a comeback if he chooses to. He will not be giving up his position as secretary general of President Mandela's party, the African National Congress. 
 At a news conference in Cape Town with Mr. Mandela, Mr. Ramaphosa, 43, a lawyer and former trade unionist who played a key role in negotiations to end apartheid, said South Africa needed more competent blacks in the business sector.
"There is an overconcentration of capable people in Parliament and Cabinet," Mr. Ramaphosa said. "We need more black people at a senior level to begin to transform the economy, and I want to play a role."
Mr. Ramaphosa said he intended to join New Africa Investments Ltd., known as NAIL, after he finishes his current job, leading the committee that is writing South Africa's new constitution. The work is to be finished next month.
The details of Mr. Ramaphosa's new job were not announced, but it is widely understood that he wants to take part in one of South Africa's most interesting business efforts -- the transfer of major divisions of South Africa's multibillion-dollar conglomerates to blacks.
New Africa Investments, which already owns shares in a cellular telephone company, a major insurer and The Sowetan newspaper, is trying to buy 48 percent of the Johnnies Industrial Corporation (Johnnic), a division of the Anglo American Corporation.
Johnnic, which began as a mining house with interests in gold, diamonds, platinum and coal, has major investments in everything from business publications to breweries to Toyota of South Africa. Anglo American is offering the division only to black buyers.
But New Africa Investments, whose chairman is Dr. Ntatho Motlana, Mr. Mandela's personal doctor and a Soweto businessman and politician, is apparently having difficulty raising the money. Mr. Ramaphosa may be able to give the company the credibility to raise the $1 billion it needs to buy Johnnic.
Mr. Mbeki, the Deputy President, emerged as the front-runner for Mr. Mandela's job shortly after the 1994 elections, when Mr. Mandela picked him as his First Deputy President. Mr. Mbeki spent 28 of his 54 years in exile, many of them as an envoy of the African National Congress. He is known for his diplomatic skill and his charm, but is considered a shrewd, even ruthless politician.
When Mr. Mbeki was chosen as a Deputy President, Mr. Ramphosa, who is 11 years younger, declined a job in the cabinet and agreed to head the Constitutional Assembly.
At the news conference today, Mr. Mandela praised Mr. Ramaphosa's work in Government and seemed to suggest that joining the private sector was simply an extension of his political work. Mr. Mandela has forbidden members of the Government to hold directorships or take other lucrative offers from corporations.
The President said, "His presence in the private sector will further cement the critical partnership between the A.N.C. and Government on the one hand, and business, the trade union movement and the rest of civil society on the other."
Supporters of Mr. Ramaphosa say his shift to business may help him should he return to politics. While others struggle with the bureaucracies and fiscal difficulties of the Government, he should find it relatively easy to make impressive strides toward empowering black business executives, his supporters say.

HEADLINE: A Hospital Worries About 'People Who Fall Through the Cracks'

DATELINE: LONG BRANCH, N.J.

 BODY:
For most of his life, William Logan worked in heavy construction, and he was always able to get decent health insurance through the union. Then the heart problems started. He lost his job, and a succession of other jobs didn't pay well and didn't come with health benefits.
Without health insurance, Mr. Logan, 50, has been receiving free medical care at Monmouth Medical Center. Doctors here installed a pacemaker, and Mr. Logan returns regularly to the outpatient clinic for checkups. 
 "Any time you have a problem, you get taken care of here," Mr. Logan said on a recent clinic visit as nurses checked his blood pressure and lectured him on his diet.
Officials at Monmouth Medical Center, a 527-bed teaching hospital just a few blocks from the ocean and far from the state's large cities, said they have provided millions of dollars in free medical care to the uninsured this year without any reimbursement from the state. And the $6.9 million they received from the state last year, they said, did not cover the year's $11.9 million cost of charity care. New Jersey distributed $388 million for charity care last year to hospitals around the state, but Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and the Legislature have been unable to come up with a plan to pay for it this year.
Most of the beneficiaries are like Mr. Logan. They do not earn enough to afford private health insurance, and yet are ineligible for Medicaid, which serves the poor and disabled.
"These are the people who fall through the cracks," said Christopher M. Dadlez, president of Monmouth Medical Center. "When we had commercial insurers, some of this burden was passed off to the insurers. But the insurers don't want that burden. Managed care certainly does not want it, so the hospitals are taking it on the chin. The state is asking private, not-for-profit hospitals to assume the entire burden of care for the indigent. That is extremely difficult and extremely expensive."
In New Jersey, where there are no acute-care county or municipal hospitals, the state reimbursed 84 hospitals for a significant portion of the free care they provided last year. Most states do not.
Charity care in New Jersey was financed by a surcharge on patient bills until the state in 1993 began taking $1.6 billion from the unemployment compensation fund to pay the bill. But the authority to continue dipping into that fund expired on Dec. 31.
On April 15, the state will miss its third monthly payment. Mr. Dadlez and other hospital administrators around the state say that unless they begin receiving reimbursement, they will be forced to shut down outpatient clinics, close wards and lay off staff. Many hospitals have already delayed payments to suppliers.
Mr. Dadlez said the number of uninsured patients has risen 30 percent at his hospital in six years. While part of the increase is due to people losing decent-paying jobs with benefits, Mr. Dadlez attributed much of the increase to the expansion of Monmouth's outpatient clinics, a move intended in part to draw patients away from costly treatment in Monmouth's emergency room. The clinics have also drawn patients who might have gone to other nearby hospitals.
"As other hospitals are ratcheting down their accessibility to free care, we are assuming a larger percentage of that population," he said. He estimates the charity care bill will exceed $15 million this year.
Faced with plummeting payments from insurers, and huge cuts proposed in Medicaid and Medicare, Mr. Dadlez said the hospital has reduced costs by $27 million in recent years even as the uninsured patient volume has risen.
"We are trying to be very responsible community partners, and do our best," Mr. Dadlez said. "But it is very unreasonable for the public to think that the hospitals can carry this burden and survive and still have the type of facilities that the public expects in terms of the technology and the services."

HEADLINE: Money Arriving Soon for Summer Job Programs

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
Cities and towns trying to set up summer jobs programs for poor youths will have to scramble because the $625 million from the Federal Government to pay for them are just becoming available after being held up by the budget fight.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said on Friday that the money would be released immediately to allow localities to find schools, teachers, supervisors, work sites and jobs and to recruit applicants. 
 California will receive the largest allocation, $111 million, to create 96,013 jobs, while $49 million will go to Texas to create 43,151 jobs, and $43 million will be sent to New York for 37,856 jobs.
The states receiving the lowest number of jobs are Delaware, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. Under the guidelines issued on Friday, Connecticut will receive $5.26 million to create 4,544 jobs, while New Jersey is to obtain nearly $18.4 million for 15,889 jobs.
Because of the budget delays, Mr. Reich said, cities and states still will have to "work double time" to get their programs in place in time.
The programs are estimated to provide summer work for 539,500 youths 14 to 21 years old.
The Government is usually able to advise cities and states well in advance of summer how much money is available.
Congressional Republicans have now agreed to permit the Administration to give the program at 75 percent of last year's level, the Labor Department said. The money is still awaiting appropriation.
The program provides public-sector jobs for youths who live in areas with high unemployment. Participants can earn $1,100 to $1,400 during the summer.
Jobs include clerical positions, maintenance work, park and recreation activities, hospital employment, aiding the elderly and tutoring and assisting at day-care centers.
But Mr. Reich said despite the Government money, the private sector is urgently needed to create more summer jobs. He said a study indicated that there were more than two eligible youths for every public-sector job.
"Because our summer job funding is reduced this year, it is even more critical that farsighted business leaders create private-sector summer jobs as an investment in the future of their own companies, communities and the young people of this nation," he said.

HEADLINE: Swirling Around Unabom Suspect, an Environmental Dispute

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: LINCOLN, Mont., April 11

 BODY:
In the last half-dozen years that Theodore J. Kaczynski has lived his solitary, lonely life just outside this rugged mountain hamlet, a plan to gouge out one of the biggest open-pit gold mines has bitterly divided the people here.
Some said the mine proposed by Phelps Dodge, the principal partner in the project, would infuse much-needed cash into the hardscrabble local economy. But environmentalists argue that the mine would threaten the habitat of the Blackfoot River, the setting for the book and movie "A River Runs Through It," and endanger the range of the elk, deer, bears, antelope and bald eagles that roam the area. 
 The Seven-Up Pete Mine -- named for an old-time prospector who favored a poker game in which seven cards are dealt face up -- would drastically change the wilderness the suspect in the Unabom case chose as his refuge from modern technological society. Many mountain slopes in the area have already been stripped bare by logging.
In Lincoln, herds of deer, many known by pet names, roam the yards around the yellow blinking light that marks the center of town and nibble from feeders. Public spaces are like the inside of a diorama, filled with animals, most of them horned, that have been shot and stuffed. Men drink and eat with their hats on.
The hermit-like Mr. Kaczynski rarely spoke to anyone here, and then only briefly, so there is no clear public record of how he felt about the mine.
Becky Garland, a strong opponent of the mine and the town resident who seems to have had the longest personal conversation with Mr. Kaczynski -- a 20- to 25-minute talk -- says he talked about his need for a job, his lonely childhood and a lost love and did not even mention the mining project.
The controversy about the mine has taken on some significance in the Unabom investigation because since the project was proposed, the Unabomber appears to have shifted his targets, from people connected with universities, airlines or computers to those linked to environmental issues.
The last two victims killed were Gilbert P. Murray, the head of a Sacramento timber lobbying group who was killed in December 1994, and Thomas J. Mosser, a public relations executive killed in his New Jersey home in April 1995. Mr. Mosser's company did some work for Exxon, and the authorities believe that the bomber thought, apparently erroneously, that the company had tried to clean up the oil company's image after the Valdez oil spill in Alaska. Over all, the Unabomber has killed 3 people and injured 23.
In wondering whether Mr. Kaczynski is the Unabomber, people here have been asking themselves what he might have thought about the mine. Phelps Dodge says the mine would produce 3.7 million ounces of gold and 8 million ounces of silver over 15 years and would be expected to stay open for 25 years. The company says it would employ up to 390 people with an annual payroll of $13 million, although many of these would be heavy-equipment operators and other technically skilled personnel brought in from outside. It says it would spend around $45 million on goods and services locally.
To get at the gold, the mine would operate around the clock, grinding up a small mountain south of the Bob Marshall and Scapegoat Wilderness Areas, some of the nation's most pristine wild lands. The miners would set explosives in the rocks, grind up the debris and, finally, leach out the gold by sloshing a cyanide solution over the rubble. The mountain would be reduced to a huge pit; when the operation was finished, the mine company says, it would leave a recreational lake behind.
But environmentalists say the project would destroy the habitats of bull trout and wetslope cutthroat trout in the Blackfoot River. These fish depend on the clear, cold water of the river and its tributaries, which is already so polluted that the fishing scenes in the movie "A River Runs Through It" had to be filmed elsewhere.
The project could bring money here, but it has driven a wedge into the community, even splitting families.
At a family dinner on Easter Sunday, Tony Wood, whose relatives run the Lincoln Lodge Motel and hope that the mine would bring in business, shifted uncomfortably as he told of his opposition: "This is personal. I've hunted elk up there since I was old enough to carry a rifle."
In Lincoln, a wide space on Montana Route 200 that supports five bars, two snowmobile dealerships, an artist who carves figures of cowboys out of tree trunks with a chain saw and a very busy taxidermist, Mr. Kaczynski, with his matted hair, wild beard and gamy smell did not stand out at all.
In fact, he was nothing, a number of people volunteered, compared with a bunch called the Cabbage Patch Gang, so called because they live on Sauerkraut Creek. They really stink, townspeople said, and they wear long knives and sometimes come into town reeking of alcohol to tear up the bars.
Two years ago, in the summer, Mr. Kaczynski approached Ms. Garland, a lifelong resident who now has a business restoring ecologically damaged trout streams but was then managing Garlands, her family's dry goods and sporting equipment store. Mr. Kaczynski often stopped by the store for fishing lures, batteries and other necessities of his primitive backwoods life in an isolated 10-by-12-foot shack. But this time, he wanted to ask for advice and help in finding a job.
Ms. Garland was surprised, she said, because Mr. Kaczynski rarely spoke unless spoken to. When she agreed to talk, they set a time, and he arrived on the porch of the store to give her a three-page letter, handwritten on what she remembered as small note paper, describing his high I.Q., his advanced schooling in his early years and his education at Harvard, as well as briefly mentioning his loneliness.
"He talked of being very young, being younger than his classmates," Ms. Garland remembered. "He talked of not having friends. It seemed like he was unable to be a boy.
"He did write about having a relationship with someone at one time that didn't work out," she said. "I think he wrote the letter so he didn't have to speak about these things, so he didn't have to talk a lot. He wrote about being with classmates who were older and about being very shy."
The conversation lasted about 20 or 25 minutes, Ms. Garland said. "We sat and spoke about his wanting to get a job," she said, remembering the longest conversation she has had with a man who lived here for 20 years. "I assumed he would probably be best at research, and I gave him the names of a few organizations that I knew of.
"He was no different that day then any other day," she said. "He was just Ted. He was always quiet, shy and mannerly."
Most of the horde of journalists who stormed through Lincoln last week are gone now. But Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are still painstakingly combing through the small cabin where Mr. Kaczynski lived and where they have recovered what they say is a draft of the Unabomber's manifesto, one live bomb, a partially assembled one and what may be important evidence of handmade screws used to assemble bombs, which could provide an ironclad maker's signature. The agents have checked fly-fishing shops, interviewed a woman who sometimes cut Mr. Kaczynski's hair and even taken the envelope of wild white carrot seeds he once gave Ms. Garland's sister, Theresa.
Local entrepreneurs at enterprises like the bars and the volunteer fire department are doing a land-office business in "Home of the Unabomber" T-shirts. Local radio stations and newspapers have been running contests for new state slogans like "Montana -- the Last, Best Place to Hide," "Big Scare Country" and "At Least Our Cows Are Sane."
Theresa Garland remembers discovering a couple of years ago that Mr. Kaczynski, like her, was interested in gardening.
"I was really happy that after all these years, I finally had something to talk to him about," she said. "For all the years that Ted lived here, you could mush all our conversations into half an hour."

HEADLINE: $1.23 Billion Is Pledged In New Aid For Bosnia

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 13

 BODY:
Cash-strapped governments and international institutions around the world promised $1.23 billion more in aid today to help rebuild shattered roads, power grids and homes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, bringing the total pledged this year to more than $1.8 billion.
The Bosnian Serbs were invited, along with other Bosnian representatives, but refused to come as part of a single Bosnian delegation and spell out their needs. American officials here said their government, called the Republika Srpska, will get no money as long as men indicted for war crimes remain at the head of it. 
 "U.S. law presently precludes our assistance going to the Republika Srpska, or the U.S. supporting international financial institutions' loans to it," said Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who came with $21 million in addition to the $260.7 million in previously pledged or announced American funds for economic reconstruction in Bosnia this year.
But the European co-organizers of the conference said that international aid should eventually go to all three communities in Bosnia -- Serbs as well as Muslims and Croats -- if they comply with the peace agreement, including provisions barring the current Serb leaders from running in elections this fall.
"Assistance should be administered throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, that is to all parties in the country, but it remains conditional on full compliance by all the parties," said the European Union commissioner, Hans van den Broek, who is co-chairman of the conference with the president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn.
Carl Bildt, the international coordinator for civilian implementation of the Bosnia peace accords, said that, although "the forces of ethnic separation are still stronger than the forces of ethnic reintegration," aid for the right kind of projects -- the transportation, communications and power networks needed for economic recovery -- would encourage Bosnia's separate communities to draw back together.
Mr. Bildt blamed Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Serb military commander, for preventing Serbs from attending the conference.
"Individuals indicted for war crimes are running loose on the territory of the Federation as well as of the Serb Republic," Mr. Bildt said, referring to the two loosely joined entities in postwar Bosnia, the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska. "But the fact that Mr. Karadzic and Mr. Mladic are still trying to hang on to public office is particularly provocative -- and cannot be tolerated for long."
Hasan Muratovic, the Bosnian Prime Minister and a Muslim, said: "The conference has met our expectations. There cannot be stable peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina until elementary social and economic problems are resolved."
He said that total physical damage amounted to $80 billion and that the main economic problems now were how to create jobs for 700,000 people, one from each family, and to accommodate millions of refugees.
The World Bank has estimated that about $5.1 billion in international aid will be needed over the next three to four years, about $3.7 billion for the Muslim-Croat Federation and $1.4 billion for the Serb-controlled Republica Srpska.
Mr. Wolfensohn said the World Bank would increase its contribution by $160 million to $200 million this year, bringing the total to $310 million to $350 million.
The bank has designed 14 priority reconstruction projects for this year and next that will cost an estimated $1.3 billion, with the seed money provided by the bank. These include such things as repairing water and sewer networks in major cities, repairing bridges and clearing mines, treating war injuries, repairing municipal heating networks, and helping people with home repairs and starting small businesses.
But so far, officials here said, projects affecting Serbian areas are only in the discussion stage.
Most American economic reconstruction aid will be disbursed in dozens of projects administered by the Agency for International Development. Craig G. Buck, director of the agency's programs in Bosnia, said that he hoped to start making $138 million in loans to Bosnian communities by June 15 for repairs to buildings, bridges and roads.
American officials here said they announced $21 million in new aid, on top of the $62.7 million President Clinton pledged last December and the $198 million recently approved by Congress.
Pledges of new aid also came from Japan, which said it would provide at least $130 million this year on top of $155 million it has already provided. The European Union said it increased its overall contribution this year by $260 million, to a total of $373 million.

HEADLINE: As Revenues Drop, Hospitals Talk of Forsaking Charity Care

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

 BODY:
With managed care driving down their revenues, many hospitals around the country say they can no longer afford to provide free medical care to the growing number of uninsured who have come through their doors seeking treatment for everything from the flu to heart disease.
More than a dozen states have stepped in to reimburse hospitals for a portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars they spend on free medical treatment, mostly to the working poor. But some states have yet to address what health care experts say is a looming crisis, particularly for hospitals in urban areas. 
 Until the last few years, most hospitals were able to pass much of the cost of treating the uninsured onto paying patients. Now, many hospitals say that without more public financing they will be forced to turn uninsured patients away for all but emergency care, which is required under Federal law.
New Jersey, one of the few states committed to reimbursing hospitals for treatment of the uninsured, paid $388 million to 84 hospitals last year. But state officials have been unable to agree on how to pay for hospital treatments this year, illustrating how difficult it is for states to help cover the cost of free medical care when taxpayers are pressuring politicians to reduce government spending.
With Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and the State Legislature at an impasse over a new financing plan, hospitals will go without their third state payment this year, which would have been due tomorrow. Since they have not been reimbursed for more than $100 million in free medical care, some hospitals have stopped payments to suppliers and are drawing up plans to close wards and lay off employees.
Keith J. McLaughlin, president of the Raritan Bay Medical Center in Perth Amboy, said the hospital's community health clinic as well as its substance abuse and methadone maintenance programs would be shut down if the state does not provide reimbursements.
"Providing health care for those in need is not a hospital problem," Mr. McLaughlin said. "It is a statewide social problem, and therefore the state's responsibility. Because of our inability to cost-shift, we can no longer subsidize their responsibility."
Until health maintenance organizations began forcing hospitals to cut rates and reduce hospital stays, hospitals were able to shift much of the cost of treating the uninsured onto paying patients. Hospital administrators said they have cut costs and many have opened out-patient clinics to reduce expensive emergency-room visits. Even so, hospital administrators say there is just not enough money to cover those who cannot afford private health insurance and who are not eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, the state and Federal programs for the poor, the elderly and the disabled.
Adding to the hospitals' woes, hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to the Medicaid and Medicare programs over the next seven years are pending in Congress.
A hospital's ability to manage the growing financial pressures depends significantly on where the hospital is located. Health care experts say the hospitals facing the biggest strain are those in urban and poor rural settings where patients are less likely to be insured.
And proposed state and Federal cuts in graduate medical education training are expected to severely hamper the efforts of teaching hospitals that treat large numbers of uninsured patients.
"Over the last decade, we had been somewhat protected by a combination of methods to put together dollars to cover the cost of free care," said Dr. H. Richard Nesson, chief executive officer of Partners Healthcare System in Boston, the new name for the recently merged Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. "We are in a dramatic period of change, and as long as those of us who are responsible for these institutions believe that we have committed ourselves to caring for the community, and don't close our doors, we are going to be in great difficulty."
At the same time, many local governments around the nation are looking to reduce their costs at municipal and county hospitals, including selling and closing them. This growing trend is raising questions about where the increasing numbers of uninsured patients are to go for medical care and who is going to pay for their care in the absence of universal health coverage. Studies show that the number of Americans without health insurance has risen by 5 million, to almost 40 million, since 1989.
Although Federal law requires that hospitals provide emergency medical treatment until the patient is stabilized without regard to an ability to pay, some states also require that hospitals provide charity care to maintain their tax-exempt status as nonprofit organizations.
Some states, including New York, still cover most of the cost of free hospital care through surcharges on hospital bills to paying patients. But Gov. George E. Pataki is moving toward deregulating hospital rates, which means that insurance companies can negotiate discounts. New York hospital administrators worry that after deregulation they will be unable to pass the surcharge to the insurance companies.
"The entity that gets stuck with it is the hospital," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade association. "Competitive forces and uncompensated care are antithetical to each other. Everybody has to realize that they have a stake in uncompensated care. But in the absence of a national solution, it is clear to me that each state and employer, self-insured company, as well as private insurers, has to step up to the plate and say this is our responsibility too. The key to this is to try to find revenue sources that are as broadly based as possible."
Some states have dedicated tax revenues to help reimburse free medical care. In Washington State, charity care is partly paid for through a 2.9 percent excise tax on motor vehicles. Indiana uses county property tax revenues to reimburse not only hospitals but doctors and ambulance services up to $35 million a year for free medical care.
In California, vehicle license fees and a portion of sales tax revenues are provided to counties to help pay for care for the uninsured. And a tax on cigarettes is also partly earmarked to pay public and private hospitals for charity care.
But many states do not have any public hospitals or any public financing system in place.
In Pennsylvania, there are no public acute-care hospitals and no source of state tax revenue, except for a small Medicaid subsidy program to those hospitals with the largest Medicaid caseloads. While Tennessee and Oregon are looking to cover some of the hospital costs of indigent care by extending Medicaid eligibility to the working poor, Gov. Thomas Ridge of Pennsylvania is seeking to remove 270,000 people from the state's Medicaid rolls.
Pennsylvania hospital industry officials estimate that the state's 207 hospitals provide $400 million in unreimbursed free medical care a year. Under Governor Ridge's proposal to reduce Medicaid spending, hospital officials say their burden will increase from $400 million to $700 million a year.
"Unless states come forward with funding mechanisms for uncompensated care, there is going to be greater and greater pressure on many hospitals," said David M. Frankford, a professor of law at Rutgers University who specializes in health care regulation and financing. "The buck keeps on getting passed downward. If they can't shift costs to the private insurers, then they are in trouble, particularly if you have hospitals with large Medicaid and Medicare populations."
Mr. Frankford said that one problem facing the nation's hospitals is that they have "tended to cry wolf" over the years about their inability to make ends meet. "But given the systemic pressures, they might not be crying wolf now," he said.
In Massachusetts, hospital administrators say they can no longer carry the burden of charity care alone. Until this year, insurance companies paid a surcharge on hospital bills that was distributed to those hospitals with the highest free-medical-care costs. But now that the state has deregulated rates, hospital administrators contend that the program is in jeopardy. They say the insurers are no longer paying the surcharge because they are now receiving discounted rates.
Until 1992, New Jersey imposed a surcharge on hospital bills. Since 1993, after the deregulation of hospital rates, the state has reimbursed hospitals for free medical care by diverting almost $1.6 billion from the state's unemployment insurance fund. But the state's legislative authority to take money out of that fund expired on Dec. 31 and both the business community and organized labor have strongly objected to proposals that the state continue to draw from the fund, which is supported by employer taxes and payroll taxes on employees. Governor Whitman, who failed to win support for a cigarette tax increase to help cover the costs of charity care, contends there isn't enough money in the state's operating budget to foot the bill.
Joseph Avellone, chief operating officer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, said that private insurers were under pressure from businesses to reduce the high cost of health insurance and that hospitals needed to do a better job reducing their costs.
"The challenge for the hospitals in our state is to become more cost competitive," Mr. Avellone said.
Yet Mr. Avellone said that Blue Cross recognized that it shared part of the responsibility of covering the costs of the uninsured and would like to be involved in drawing up a solution. "The reform ought to be around universal insurance coverage," he said.
Glenn Wilson, a professor of social medicine at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina, said that it was unrealistic to expect that market forces will provide for the poor because a free market economy does not redistribute money.
"The market may make hospitals and health care more efficient, but it will not provide for the poor," Mr. Wilson said. "At some point, we will do without care or we will raise the money. The hospitals can't give it away."
"Whether the hospital is public or private, someone is going to have to pay for the people who have no money," he said. "Until we quit fantasizing that that is not true, we are not going to make any progress."

HEADLINE: Dole Assails Clinton for 'Crunch' of Low Wages and High Taxes

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WEST DES MOINES, Iowa, April 13

 BODY:
With tax-filing day fast approaching, Bob Dole today lambasted what he called "the Clinton crunch," which he said had squeezed most Americans between higher taxes and lower wages.
In a speech coinciding with antitax protests being staged by Republicans across the country, Mr. Dole told a rally of 300 people here that after Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992, "he raised taxes $265 billion, the largest tax increase in the history of the world." 
 Now, he said, the typical two-income family pays more in taxes than it spends on food, clothing and shelter combined, with 38 percent of income going to Federal, state and local taxes, and 28 percent going to food, clothing and housing.
"The typical worker spends three hours of every eight-hour day just to pay his or her tax bill," Mr. Dole said. "That's how oppressive it is."
Reviving a theme he raised last spring but had rarely returned to since, he added: "Two incomes are now an economic necessity for families, not a choice. Real hourly wages are 5 percent lower than a decade ago, and they only increased one penny per hour since Clinton was elected."
Mr. Dole said Mr. Clinton had broken his promises to cut taxes, balance the Federal budget and overhaul welfare, and so "it may be necessary to elect me to keep the promises he made in 1992."
Mr. Dole, completing a three-day fund-raising swing through Tennessee, Texas and Iowa, returned here today for the first time since he nearly lost in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 12. "I barely limped out of Iowa with a narrow victory," he said.
Still, he said, he came to thank Iowa for starting him on what turned out to be a rocky road toward wrapping up the Republican Presidential nomination, only to wake up this morning to a headline in The Des Moines Register that blared, "Clinton sprints past Dole.'
A new Iowa Poll, conducted last week for the newspaper, showed Mr. Clinton, who beat President George Bush here in 1992, trouncing Mr. Dole by 17 percentage points among Iowans likely to vote in November. If the election were held today, 53 percent would vote for Mr. Clinton and 36 percent for Mr. Dole, according to the poll.
"I saw the headline," Mr. Dole told his supporters at the rally. "Didn't bother me a bit. We're 206 days away from Nov. 5, 1996. We know it's not going to be easy."
He placed blame for his low standing on what he called the "Forbes onslaught" of negative television commercials last winter. "It's going to take a while to recover," he told reporters later. "I bet in 60 days those numbers will be very close together." He acknowledged that Steve Forbes, who popularized the flat tax, "had a message" of a "flatter, simpler, fairer system," and Mr. Dole said he would institute one as President.
The Senator also said he hoped to meet with Ross Perot soon and encourage him to support the Republican ticket in the fall instead of running for President again.
At a speech in Houston on Friday night, Mr. Dole gave a preview of the case he would make to the Texan: "If we want to change America, we need to change the occupant of the White House. It is that simple, Mr. Perot."
In Iowa, he also told his supporters that he did have a vision -- just not the one he said the news media wanted him to have. "If I had 10 new spending programs that would tax you more, I would be a visionary" in the media's view, he said.
"My vision for America is pretty much like your vision," he said, "for your family, your job or your farm."

HEADLINE: CHILDREN FOR SALE -- A special report.;
Asian Childhoods Sacrificed to Prosperity's Lust

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SVAY PAK, Cambodia

 BODY:
She giggled for a moment, a 13-year-old girl, all sparkling eyes and white teeth, her laughter washing over the grunts from a pornographic video playing a few feet away. Then the brothel owner strutted over.
The owner, a hearty, friendly woman in her late 20's who paid good money to buy the girl, named Sriy, cheerfully and explicitly recommended her anatomical features and said the $10 fee was not so great because "she only just lost her virginity." 
 In fact, that is a lie. Sriy was sold into prostitution two years ago.
As if to prove her point, the owner of the brothel, in this town 50 miles northwest of the capital, reached out and tugged down on the girl's dress to display her left breast, or rather the nipple of what will become a breast if Sriy survives to maturity. "You like?" the owner asked in broken English. "You take girl?"
Sriy endures these indignities, along with up to 10 customers a night, because she is considered the brothel owner's property. Sold by her stepfather to another brothel, which then sold her to this one, the girl must work until the debt is deemed to be repaid. Or until she gets AIDS.
If she tries to escape, she will be caught, severely beaten, perhaps starved, and locked inside her room, while still being forced to have sex with many customers a night. A neighboring brothel burned down in mid-March, and the bodies of two girls were found in the wreckage. They had been locked inside, forced to have sex with customers in their rooms, and never allowed out because they showed signs of wanting to escape.
Sriy is one of tens of thousands of children who are slaves working in the plantations of the 1990's: the brothels of Cambodia, India, China, Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan and other countries.
Americans and other Westerners helped build the child prostitution trade in Asia, and many of the brothel districts date from R&R breaks from the Vietnam War, or surround former American military bases. Now they sustain the trade with an appetite for what at home would be child molestation and rape. One result is a partnership between local people who run the brothels and Westerners like the one who posted an item on the Internet informing sex tourists that in Cambodia "a six-year-old is available for US$3."
 
Family
Mother and Sister Pimp for Young Ones
In the seedy Maleta district of Manila, near the waterfront and virtually in the shadow of a large church, lives a family with four daughters ranging from 8 to 18. Until a few months ago, the mother and oldest daughter procured for the 8-year-old and a 12-year-old among foreigners, social workers say. When a customer was found, the oldest daughter would go to school to bring her sisters home early, telling the teachers that they had some family business.
The 8-year-old was raped by American, Australian and Japanese men. When the 12-year-old tried to resist, her sister held her arms and another pimp held her legs so the men could rape her more easily.
It was not supposed to be this way. Six decades ago Asian cities like Shanghai, Hong Kong and Hanoi were notorious for their brothels, but it had seemed that economic development would allow countries to grow out of the worst of the squalor. Now Asia has enjoyed an historic economic boom, yet child prostitution is, by most accounts, increasing.
By estimates of social workers and Governments, more than a million girls and boys, aged 17 and younger, are engaged in prostitution in Asia, although all these figures are no more than wild guesses. The slaves, in the sense of those who are locked up or owned by a brothel, are a minority. But even among those teen-agers who now offer themselves on street corners, many first entered the sex trade unwillingly, sold by parents or simply kidnapped off the street.
Three factors seem to be aggravating the problem: rising economic development, which initially seems to increase the appetite for children more quickly than it reduces the supply; the rise of capitalism, so markets emerge not just for rice and pork but also for virgin girls; and, perhaps most important, the fear of AIDS, driving customers to younger girls and boys who are regarded as more likely to be disease-free.
All three factors merge in the person of a shy 14-year-old Vietnamese girl, Miss Nguyen, who one day recently was sitting in a brothel here in Svay Pak, waiting to be sold for the very first time. Her brothel is one of dozens in Svay Pak, all nice two-story brick buildings that contrast with the rutted dirt streets and open sewers of the surrounding neighborhood.
Miss Nguyen was wearing a long purple dress, and the other girls in Svay Pak were also dressed lavishly and adorned with cosmetics and jewelry that looked out of place on their tiny figures. Miss Nguyen's story emerged slowly, because the brothel owners often beat girls for telling anyone about their backgrounds and because this brothel owner was paying particular attention to Miss Nguyen to make sure she does not escape.
The owner, a dour woman in her 30's, had bought Miss Nguyen three days earlier and was holding her off the market until she found a foreigner willing to pay $500 for her virginity. "It's not so expensive," the brothel owner said. "After all, she only loses her virginity once. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
Miss Nguyen was smuggled across the border from Vietnam where, as in Cambodia, the collapse of strict Communist ideology has been accompanied by the rise of a huge flesh trade. The buyer of Miss Nguyen's virginity will probably be a foreigner, the owner said, most likely a newly prosperous ethnic Chinese from Taiwan, China or Singapore. A Chinese superstition holds that sex with a virgin helps makes a man young again, or that it can cure venereal disease.
A 15-year-old Vietnamese girl who is also new to the brothel, having been sold by her mother, piped up to say that a Singaporean man paid $500 for her virginity a few days earlier. It is eerie to hear the girls speak of these topics because, to Western eyes, they look several years younger than their ages, not like sexual beings at all, more like American 10-year-olds than teen-agers.
"It hurt a lot and I cried," the girl added. "It still hurts me, several days later. But it's not quite so bad now."
Miss Nguyen shuddered and leaned against the 15-year-old.
"I'm scared," she said softly. "I'm scared."
 
Fear
A Deadly Game Of Sexual Roulette
In another Cambodian brothel, a 14-year-old girl also said she was scared -- of AIDS. And with good reason. The girl said she was sold by her mother to the brothel a week earlier.
In this case it was a Cambodian, not a foreigner, who purchased her virginity -- a district police commander paid $500. The man, like many customers, did not use a condom.
Now the girl, as a fresh arrival, sells for $10, but in another week she will drop to $5 and then eventually to $2 or $3. She lay down on a bench, her long pink dress flowing over her, full of anger and helplessness.
"My mother needed money, because she was sick," the girl said, staring at the ceiling. "How can I be angry with her? She's my Mom."
A decade ago, such a slight young girl would not have been in much demand. But now men throughout Asia are turning toward younger and younger children, partly because they are deemed less likely to be infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
In fact, the children are greater risks because of their youth: their vaginas and anuses are easily torn, creating sores and bleeding that permit the AIDS virus to spread.
"Most men I know want younger girls, the younger the better, because then they can scare the hell out of us," said Tisay, a 14-year-old street-walker in Quezon City, the Philippines. "Older girls can set a price, can set conditions, but younger girls can't do that."
"I'd prefer safe sex," Tisay added. "But it's hard to insist that a man wear a condom. I'm small and I'm alone and I can't do anything about it if he doesn't want to."
Tisay has contracted gonorrhea, which increases the risk of acquiring AIDS, but she refuses to be treated. Partly she is afraid that if the other girls find out, they will tell her customers and drive them away, and partly, her behavior is simply self-destructive.
"My life's worth nothing now," a social worker quoted Tisay as telling her. "It's better for me to die."
The AIDS virus is spreading extremely rapidly among prostitutes in Asia. India had its first AIDS case in 1986, yet already some 1.6 million Indians are infected with H.I.V. Thailand may have 800,000 people infected with the virus, and Myanmar -- where condoms were banned until 1992 and are still rare -- has some 400,000 infected people. In Cambodia, one study found that 39 percent of prostitutes are infected with H.I.V.
The virus spreads rapidly from country to country in part because of trafficking of prostitutes across borders, but also because customers tend to hop from place to place. Sex tours started in Japan, allowing groups of men to visit brothels in South Korea or Taiwan, and now other countries are doing the same. Indeed, South Korean and Taiwanese men are now prosperous enough to travel on sex tours of their own to places like Bangkok or Manila.
Some Asian governments are beginning to prosecute foreigners caught having sex with minors, as Dr. Gavin A. M. Scott can attest. Dr. Scott, a tall, lean Briton who has lived in Cambodia practicing medicine since 1992, is still fuming over having to serve five months in a Phnom Penh prison last year on rape charges after paying five teen-age boys to have sex with him.
The police and the court said the boys were 14 to 16 years old, but Dr. Scott said that they were over 16 and that he simply engaged in sex with prostitutes.
"It was basically a case against homosexuality," said Dr. Scott, who is gay. "But it was misrepresented as a case about child sex, which it was not."
How do the customers regard their actions? From a conversation with Dr. Scott, who continues to practice medicine in Phnom Penh, and from materials published by pedophile organizations, it seems that customers sometimes offer two defenses.
First, they note that the age of consent in much of the world is 16 -- indeed, it is 14 in Pennsylvania and Hawaii -- and suggest that there is nothing wrong with people of such an age engaging in sexual acts. Second, they sometimes suggest that young prostitutes are at least earning substantial sums to help their families, and that the alternative would be backbreaking jobs that would be even more demeaning and dangerous.
A growing number of Westerners are, like Dr. Scott, being arrested for sexual abuse of children in Asia, although usually they are simply fined and deported. Prison sentences are very rare.
 
Betrayal
Selling a Daughter For a Karaoke System
What kind of a mother would sell her daughters?
Leonilla Olayres is a 33-year-old mother in a slum near Manila's airport. She sat on a plastic chair in her hovel, nursing her youngest child as other children scampered around the tiny room and the dirt street outside. The stench of garbage and an open sewer wafted into the room. Although the family is poor, it is not starving. An expensive new karaoke music system, costing hundreds of dollars, sits in a place of honor in the middle of the wall.
Where did the family get the money for such a purchase? Apparently in part from Mrs. Olayres's oldest daughters, aged 10 and 12. On five occasions over the last year, by Mrs. Olayres's own count, she handed over the two girls to a Japanese man, Hisayoshi Maruyama, for cash.
The most recent time was Feb. 23 when, according to the police report, Mrs. Olayres delivered the 10-year-old to Mr. Maruyama's hotel room, accepted $60 and left.
The police say that they responded to a complaint from a relative and found Mr. Maruyama and the 10-year-old girl, both naked, in his hotel room. The police report says that Mr. Maruyama had kissed the girl, undressed her, sexually abused her, tied her up, photographed her and forced her to perform oral sex.
"I didn't know," Mrs. Olayres said matter-of-factly. She insisted that she had believed Mr. Maruyama's explanation that he wanted to take pictures for a Japanese foster-parents organization. Anyway, Mrs. Olayres added, many neighbors had also hired out their daughters to Mr. Maruyama.
The two girls were taken to a Government-run shelter where, through a social worker, they declined to be interviewed about their mother. Mr. Maruyama, a 34-year-old with a mop of black hair and a modest paunch who identifies himself as a medical doctor at a Tokyo institute that seems not to exist, insisted in an interview in the Manila jail that he had been framed by the police.
Mr. Maruyama acknowledged that he had been arrested before in Manila, in 1991, in very similar circumstances. But he said he had been framed then, too.
Police reports from that time say that he forced a 10-year-old boy and his 11-year-old sister to engage in sexual acts together, and then further abused six young boys and a 7-year-old girl so he could take pornographic videos of them.
Mr. Maruyama argued that his main legal problem is that he did not have enough cash to pay a bribe. He said that when his hotel room was raided, he was not initially arrested, and police records confirm this. According to Mr. Maruyama's account, he was taken to a police office and asked for a $4,000 bribe. Only when he could not pay, he said, was he arrested.
 
Despair
Poisoned Cookies, Silent Fury
The way a child's fortunes can suddenly collapse was underscored by the case late last year of four Cambodian girls who tried to help a middle-aged woman who appeared to be ill on the road. According to a social worker who works, the woman offered the girls a cookie each, in a show of gratitude, but the cookie was drugged and the girls passed out.
Then the woman hired a taxi to take them to a brothel, which she entered to negotiate a sale. The taxi driver realized what was happening and felt badly because he recognized one of the unconscious girls. So he drove off and took the girls home before the woman came out. Otherwise, they very likely would have finished their lives in the brothels.
The role of fate is fully evident in the Cambodian brothel that houses Sriy, the 13-year-old whose owner pushed down the neck of her dress to show off her chest. A moment later, the owner did the same to Sriy's best friend, a 15-year-old Vietnamese who was sold to the brothel by a man who kidnapped her.
That girl's mother finally tracked her daughter down in March, and found her working in the brothel. But since the brothel owner had paid for the girl -- even if to a kidnapper -- the mother could not take the girl home. Instead the mother had to settle for signing a contract with the brothel owner, stipulating that when the girl earns back enough money, she will be returned to her family.
"If the mother tried to grab her daughter and take her out of the brothel, the owner would have them beaten up," said a Cambodian journalist who has written about the problems of child prostitution. "And if the mother takes on the brothel owner, she can't win. The brothel owner can just pay some money to the police, or give the girl to the police, and the parents will lose."
At least, Sriy seems to think, her friend eventually has a home to go back to. Sriy hates her stepfather, who used to beat her and who took the initiative in selling her to the brothel. All she has is the memory of her mother, who died recently.
What does she think of her mother for allowing her to be sold into a brothel? Sriy's eyes grew distant as her 13-year-old mind sorted through memories of her mother.
"Mom was sick and needed money," Sriy finally said hesitantly. "She had a lung disease. I don't hate her."
Sriy's peaceful expression did not change, and she seemed lost in thought. But she began to play with a piece of brittle plastic on the table, breaking it with her slender fingers, violently crushing it into smaller and smaller pieces.

The Unabomber's Pen Pal?

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

 BODY:
Last week, as a New Jersey prosecutor was named to coordinate the Unabomber case, a Mexican farmhand opened a window into the mind of Theodore Kaczynski, the Harvard-trained mathematician who is suspected of being the Unabomber and who was the farmhand's pen pal.
"If only I had a wife and children!" Mr. Kaczynski wrote to Juan Sanchez Arreola from his cabin in Montana. And he complained of his poverty. 
 To Mr. Sanchez, who labored for half a century at menial jobs in the United States, seven years of unemployment complaints by Mr. Kaczynski rang false. With only two years of primary school education, the sun-creased 68-year-old opined that the Mexican description for "el Doctor" would be "perezoso" -- lazy. JAMES BROOKE

HEADLINE: Future of Wainwright House in Doubt Despite Trust Fund

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: RYE

 BODY:
THE seasons present a shifting tableau along the waterfront at Wainwright House Inc. here, but the 44-year-old, nonprofit organization has traditionally focused on more timeless concerns.
Hundreds say they have found a second home in the French Provincial mansion that has been the group's headquarters since 1951, participating in programs intended to heal the spirit and unite body and mind. Now, however, many fear the organization, which has used up much of its $2.2 million endowment, is experiencing a financial and spiritual crisis from which it may not recover. 
 The good news, say Friends of Wainwright House, an ad hoc committee formed after the five-acre, $8 million property was put on the market earlier this year, is that public outcry led to an offer of a $1 million trust fund and an immediate gift of $10,000 to maintain the property, with an additional $10,000 to be given yearly for 10 years.
Committee members say they are disturbed, however, because the board of trustees has not agreed to the stipulation of the donor, Werner Mark Linz, who lives next door, that none of the property be sold.
Wainwright House was founded in 1941 by the Laymen's Movement, a group of business leaders, to bring ethical and spiritual values into professional and public life.
Ten years later, the house and grounds were donated to the group by Fonrose Wainwright Condict, who in 1983 left $2.2 million to the organization.
In addition to the 12,000-square-foot main house, the property consists of a 2,150-square-foot carriage house and a 3,000-square-foot stucco Colonial house. It was the Colonial house, named Condict House for Mrs. Condict, and two acres of waterfront land, that were to have been sold.
James S. Sutterlin, board president, said there was "no intention whatever to put the property back on the market." But, he said, "Whether a board can legally commit future boards is not clear to me." He said the trustees had thanked Mr. Linz, a former trustee and board president, but added that "the details haven't been worked out yet."
Members of the committee have complained that the board has not been open in its dealings in recent months and are asking to be included in discussions of the future of Wainwright House. Kathryn Clarke, a committee member, said that while the board had not provided a financial picture of the organization, data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed a $420,000 deficit last year and a $151,000 deficit in 1993. Mr. Sutterlin said in an interview that current deficit figures were not available.
Margot Dilmaghani, another committee member, questioned the board's financial-management policies. "Apparently, they have continued to spend the endowment, which should have been safeguarded," she said. "Why does this board continue to spend without covering the deficit? Given the current crisis, which the board has allowed to occur, I wonder why this board doesn't all just resign?"
Mr. Sutterlin said the crisis began soon after the endowment was received. "Some say it was a blessing, and some not," he said of the gift. "The volunteer aspects fell off, and the programs became more expensive." He added that the falling stock market in the late 1980's caused the property to begin losing $200,000 a year, which "had to be taken in part from the capital." In addition, he said, an $800,000 renovation of the main house, which was begun in 1994, cost three times the original estimate.
In recent years, the diverse programs at Wainwright House have been led by nationally known authors, therapists and spiritualists. Participants could learn to unravel their dreams, explore such new-age areas as eco-psychology and homeopathy or discuss sexual issues with Dr. Ruth Westheimer. The courses and workshops have been a beacon to those seeking personal enlightenment, particularly in the suburbs. Some programs have also appeared zany at times to the less adventuresome. In one course, for example. "Reclaiming the Juice and Mystery of the Pagan: Goddess and Earth Traditions," participants were asked to bring "drums, bells, rattles and any other instruments that are good in groups."
Currently, however, Mr. Sutterlin said there was "a pause" in programming because of "financial stringencies and staff reductions." A cancer-support group continues to meet as does a group of older adults, who recently discussed medieval warfare and the epic poem "The Song of Roland" in the Wainwright House Library.
Ronald C. Tocci, State Assemblyman from the 85th District, which includes Rye, has served as a liaison between the special committee and the board. Mr. Tocci said his wife, Patricia, had been involved with Wainwright House for many years and he was acting as a private citizen.
He described a meeting last month in which more than 100 people, some from as far away as Woodstock and Hartford, came to tell board members of their concern for Wainwright House. "Everybody just poured their heart out," Mr. Tocci said. "There was enormous enthusiasm and support for keeping the house and property intact without subdividing it. People felt upset that they hadn't been asked to be part of coming up with a solution, and said that given the chance to participate they could come with fund-raising ideas."
The committee has asked the board, which is self-appointed, to organize a new governing structure with the participation of members, as well as to provide members with a business plan. The group has also requested that a special task force, which includes committee members, be appointed to help with the reorganization. The committee has planned an open meeting next Sunday at Wainwright House to discuss the group's future.
Mr. Sutterlin said he was in favor of holding elections for the board but said that would not happen immediately. "Meanwhile," he said, "the broader public will have the opportunity to make nominations for members of the board." He said that in the future, Wainwright House would be relying heavily on volunteers. The organization also would like to raise funds by renting space to other nonprofit groups, he said.
Both Mr. Sutterlin and committee members said that Wainwright House had a special mission, although one that may be revised. "It is a spiritual mission of outreach and opportunity for self-improvement, but also for service to the community and the world," Mr. Sutterlin said. "The realization of the mission is bound to be in the programs."
Mr. Linz, who heads the Continuum Publishing Group in Manhattan and is currently working in Cairo as a consultant to the American University, said: "The hope is that members and friends of Wainwright House will generate new creative energy that seems to be lacking in a board under siege. This is a very interesting time -- full of pain and full of promise."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Wainwright House in Rye misstated the amount that a donor has offered to keep the property from being sold. It is $100,000 a year for 10 years, not $10,000 a year.

HEADLINE: THE QUEST FOR COMFORT

BYLINE: By LAUREL GRADBER 

 BODY:
EVER since human beings learned to walk on their feet, it seems they've been trying to get off them. Apparently believing that rest couldn't be eternal without a place to recline, the anicent Egyptians filled their tombs with elegant chairs and beds. Chinese aristocrats of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) could end an evening of revelry by falling into a portable reclining armchair: the zuiwengyi, or "drunken lord's chair." In Western culture, the English Knole settee, circa 1620, featured a cushioned headrest attached to each arm with hinges. If the occupant wanted a snooze, he just racheted a pillow into position. 
 But while comfort has always been a principle in furniture design, it hasn't always been a priority. The availability of ease has evolved, reflecting changes in society, economics and technology, as well as taste. What ease was - and who enjoyed it - could well define an era.
 In early Europe, "furniture was an unspoken way to establish your pecking order," says Melissa T. Gagen, vice president, European furniture, at Christie's in New York. "As you got closer to the king, you maybe got a back on my chair."
 Both rules and furniture, however, softened in the 18th century. Many historians point to this period as the first age of real ease. Much of the change had to do with a shift in emphasis, even at court, from a formal, stylized life to a more intimate, private one. "People began to make small desks, small tables, even ice buckets," says Herve Aaron, president of Didier Aaron, New York dealers in 18th- and 19th-century antiques.
 In response to the desire for convenience - a form of comfort - craftsmen also created a wide variety of mechanical furniture. Louis V, for instance, ordered a mechanied dining room for one of his cateaus, says Anthony G. victoria, owner of Fredericks P. Victoria and Son, New York dealers specializing in Continental decorative arts. Tables were engineered to arrive and disappear through trapdoors, bypassing servants.
 "This would have been the epitome of luxury and comfort - to have all that ease, and not have the eyes of your subjects upon you," says Victoria.
 An increasingly prosperous middle class began to enjoy comfort as well. All manner of chairs were devised, some with a high, hinged back so that a man could be shaved while seated; others with a scooped-out back so that a lady could have her hair dressed.
 Both Victoria and Thierry Millerand, Sotheby's senior vice president of European furniture worldwide, note that some settees were also designed for seduction - sometimes real, sometimes metaphorical. "One of Louis XV's daughters aid she was 'lost to a chair,' because it was so comfortable that she was getting nothing done," Millerand adds.
 One of the most remarkable pieces of Louis XV's era is the royal desk. The first recorded roll-top, it was designed and built by Jean-Francois Oeben and Jean-Henri Riesener so that different compartments would pop out with the turn of a key.
 Louis XVI and his court were not ones to stint on ease, either. The queen, Marie Antoinette, found mechanical furniture convenient for pregnancy: Unable to sit comfortably, she had a table made with an adjustable top, allowing her to sew or write while standing.
 ON the other side of the Atlantic, comfort also found expression. America's Queen Anne pieces were notonly commodious, they were also easy on the eye.
 In 1753, "William Hogarth wrote about the S-curve, while he compared to the shape of a woman in a corset," says Leslie B. Keno, senior vice president and director of American furniture and decorative arts at Sotheby's in New York. Considered lovely to behold as wellas to lounge in, the S-shaped curve was all the rage in mid-18th-century furniture.
 Certainly, leisure activities played a large role in easeful design: witness card tables, gaming tables with candle pockets, tables with places for gambling chips and others with built-in backgammon boards. There were even chairs called voyelles and voyeuses (literally "voyeurs"), which featured an armrest along the top of the back, a place for an observer to rest his forearms while watching over a player's shoulder.
 In the 19th century one particular form of relaxation greatly influenced furnishings: the taking of tea. "Tea was very expensive in the 18th century, but the 19th century was the peak of British colonialism," observes Larry Sirolli, director of English furniture at Sotheby's. "It was very abundant, and the ritual of tea crated a very intimate setting."
 Intimacy brought a desire for comfort, making the 19th century the age of upholsterer. Expanding trade routes made fabric more affordable, and a more relaxed style of entertaining required its own furniture. In fact, upholstered pieces reached their most voluptuous heights in an era not usually associated with sensuality: the reign of Queen Victoria.
 "The backs on Victorian furniture were stuffed better, with horsehair and cotton," says Sirolli. The industrial revolution also popularized the use of spring construction, forever transforming comfort in furniture.
 But while some see the mid-19th century as the triumph of comfort, others see it as the failure of taste. "Furniture makers thought it was the end of quality," says WilliamStrafford, assistant vice president, European furniture, at Christie's. The reason? "An overstuffed chair is pretty blobby and blurs all the outlines."
 Indeed, a certain tension between ease and esthetics has persisted throughout design. If ease is all, you might as well choose a beanbag chair, observes Strafford with a shudder. On the other hand, furniture designers most concerned with purity of line - from the proponents of the Arts and Carfts Movmeent in the 19th century to the modernists of the 20th - have often produced pieces that are famously uncomfortable.
 "A lot of Frank Lloyd Wright's stuff isn't comfortable for any length of time," says Sanford L. Smith, president of Sanford L.Smith & Associates, which produces New york's annual Modernism show at the Seventh Regiment Armory. "Neither is Charles Rennie Mackintosh's." their work, however, brings high prices, which illustrates a certain irony about the 20th century: in the 17th century, only the wealthy could afford comfort; now, it seems, only the wealthy can afford discomfort. Whereas the middle and working classes need chairs that function as chairs, the rich can indulge in pieces that are more works of art than places to sit.
 "All 'form follows function' means is that you can sit in it," says Smith, citing the Bauhaus credo. "But do you want to sit in it for 15 minutes - Andy Warhol's 15 minutes?"
 Some modern pieces, of course, do offer ease. In Smith's own bedroom he has the "Airline" chair by Kem Weber, a well-upholstered but highly sculptural cantilevered lounge chair designed in 1934-35. "I love the line - it's very streamlined and aerodynamic," Smith says. "And it also happens to be a very comfortable chair."
 That combination seems to be the ideal: beautiful and restful. Life, after all, is hard enough; who could blame the ancient Egyptians for wanting to make sure that the after life was comfortable furnished?

The Affirmative Action Fraud
Can We Restore the American Civil Rights Vision?

Barbara Bergmann's "In Defense of Affirmative Action," Terry Eastland's "Ending Affirmative Action" and Clint Bolick's "Affirmative Action Fraud" are, each of them, short and punchy polemics, and they make a pretty good debate, if you read all three together. Ms. Bergmann thinks that affirmative action is much needed, has done some good but not enough, has mostly been voluntary but shouldn't be, is economically beneficial, can solve many of the country's worst problems and should be expanded in the future. Mr. Eastland and Mr. Bolick think that affirmative action harms America, encourages racism, demoralizes blacks, is coercive, is itself a worst problem, betrays the country's values, tramples liberty, is economically disastrous and should desist forthwith. 
 Ms. Bergmann, a liberal economist at American University, is flexible in argument and good at keeping her cool, except sometimes. Mr. Eastland, the editor of Forbes Mediacritic, and Mr. Bolick, the litigation director at the Institute for Justice in Washington, are conservative op-ed hotheads (Mr. Bolick wrote the Wall Street Journal article that labeled Lani Guinier a "quota queen") and are fond of thumping a patriotic tub. Ms. Bergmann is defter, in a word. But she faces two opponents and so the sides are evenly matched.
All three authors agree on one point: that black America stands at the center of the debate -- much more than women or anyone else with a claim on special or preferential treatment. This recognition yields an insight into how the affirmative action argument has evolved over the years into the current brouhahas over university admissions and over a range of other issues around the country. It seems to be America's fate that every time somebody proposes a practical way to improve the black condition, somebody else sees a threat to universal liberty. The abolitionists wanted to free the slaves, but the antiabolitionists saw an attack on self-government and the heritage of 1776. During the civil rights revolution in the 1950's and early 60's, the champions of racial integration wanted to stop businesses from discriminating against blacks. But the partisans of segregation saw a threat to every individual's freedom to pick his own business associates.
The argument over affirmative action got started in a similar fashion. The policy of deliberately seeking out blacks for jobs, promotions, contracts and college admissions was begun, tentatively in the Johnson Administration and forcefully in the Nixon Administration, as a way of bringing blacks into the mainstream (though in Nixon's case, there was a further aim of breaking up the Democratic coalition -- meaning that affirmative action turns out to be the longest lasting and most effective Nixonian dirty trick ever played). And the policy's opponents saw a threat to every individual's right to compete on equal terms at work, in business and in school.
Mr. Eastland and Mr. Bolick, in their separate books, give vent to the opposition view by invoking a curious interpretation of the American past. According to them, America's "civil rights vision," to use Mr. Bolick's phrase, was created by the Founding Fathers as a doctrine of color-blind natural rights. And though the doctrine was sometimes betrayed, as by slavery and Jim Crow, it was faithfully upheld during the next two centuries by the abolitionists, then by the more enlightened Supreme Court Justices, then by the traditional civil rights leaders in the era of A. Philip Randolph and Martin Luther King Jr. --only to be betrayed yet again by affirmative action today. For affirmative action, they contend, has destroyed the grand American tradition of fair and equal competition by resurrecting the ancient nasty practice of categorizing people by race.
Color-blind antiracism has not generally been regarded as America's main historic tradition, and in that respect there is something novel, not to say fantastic, in Mr. Eastland and Mr. Bolick's interpretation of the past. But for their purposes the novel interpretation is very handy. It allows the two authors to stake out a position as enemies of racism and, even so, to swell with pride at nearly two centuries of the American past (as any nostalgic conservative would like to do) and to explode with wrath at modernity's evil undoing of the virtues of yore. The simplicity of their emotion is a little off-putting. Mr. Bolick (whose sympathy for the historic "civil rights vision" nonetheless leads him to fret over a threat to liberty in the Civil Rights Act of 1964) thinks that the struggle to save America from affirmative action is now or never: "We may never have such a chance again." Mr. Eastland is calmer, yet his view too is, so to speak, strictly black and white.
As anyone can see, the repeated invocations of liberty and 1776 against practical measures to help black America leave the opponents of affirmative action vulnerable to an accusation of hypocrisy, and Ms. Bergmann is not shy about making the point. She suggests that many of the critics of affirmative action would feel perfectly happy to let racial and sex discrimination go on forever. To call someone a hypocrite is not much of a rebuttal, though. The argument against affirmative action might be valid even if its proponents advanced it hypocritically (which, in any case, Mr. Eastland and Mr. Bolick would indignantly deny doing). And so, in the face of challenges that invoke liberty and universal rights, the defenders of affirmative action have had to look for other arguments.
Mr. Eastland conducts a useful tour of those arguments in "Ending Affirmative Action." The original defense was made by Lyndon Johnson, in 1965, on a very narrow basis. Johnson said, referring to blacks, "You do not take a person who for years has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, you're free to compete with all the others, and justly believe that you have been completely fair." But soon enough the narrow justification broadened to include women, then a variety of minority groups that had suffered one or another oppression related to skin color. (Nonpigmentally oppressed minority groups have mostly had to fend for themselves.)
Then a new argument appeared, which instead of invoking the need to right the wrongs of the past invoked, in the name of "diversity," a positive value in ethnic and sexual identity, and sought a proportional representation for each of those identities in all sorts of American institutions. As Mr. Eastland observes, the diversity argument transforms affirmative action from a bit of remedial social engineering into a permanent system for dividing up the American spoils along ethnic and sexual lines. He points out that sometimes we hear today (though not yet in the courts) an even newer justification, which calls for affirmative action to counter injustices that have not yet occurred but possibly could in the future -- against, for instance, newly arrived immigrants.
Mr. Eastland has no better reply to these several justifications than to say that each of them represents a break from the "color-blind tradition" that he attributes to 1776. But if you study his catalogue of arguments you can see why affirmation action's defenders, finding themselves under attacks like his, have looked for broader and broader justifications. To extend Lyndon Johnson's argument to women was natural enough, given that the historical biases against both blacks and women lie so deep in American life as to have been inscribed in the original, pre-amended Constitution. Yet once the issue of universal rights had been forcefully raised by the opponents of affirmative action, the temptation became great, among its defenders, to find ways to show affirmative action to be itself a kind of universal right, not just a special program for blacks and women.
And so the search was on for ever more beneficiaries, unto absurdity. Some years ago the City Council of Richmond made a point, later abandoned, of stipulating that city contracts ought to be awarded, by preference, not just to blacks and women but also, among other people, to Eskimos. As Mr. Eastland observes, the argument for "diversity," because it no longer requires a given group of beneficiaries to cite any historic oppression at all, extends affirmative action, in principle, to absolutely everybody.
Ms. Bergmann, in her wiser moments, knows that affirmative action ought to remain a limited program and, in fact, should someday be ended. But at other moments she can't help herself, and she too hurls herself into the task of demonstrating that affirmative action is for absolutely everyone, until she has outdone the Richmond City Council. For argument's sake, she postulates an old-school New England law firm that refuses to hire Irish and Jewish lawyers, and she tells us that in such a case affirmative action ought to be mandated -- which is amusing to consider, if you try to picture a roomful of oppressed Irish and Jewish lawyers. She dangles panaceas before our eyes. She even tells us that affirmative action, if applied with gusto, would eliminate panhandling on the street.
Yet for all her analytic excesses, Ms. Bergmann knows something that has escaped her two opponents. Mr. Eastland and Mr. Bolick seem to think that were it not for the pernicious influence of government, American society would consist of nothing but free, lone individuals, exactly as presumed by a certain kind of laissez-faire political theory -- which is why both of their books harp on anecdotes about rugged individualists who have been wronged by affirmative action. ("But then affirmative action struck," as Mr. Eastland enjoys saying.) Ms. Bergmann knows that American life is built on actual social structures, not all of which are compatible with democratic ideals. And when she puts aside the search for universal justifications and, instead, focuses on the specific structures that weigh upon blacks and women, she makes sound practical sense.
She asks: Has discrimination against blacks and women disappeared? Her answer is that job segregation by race and sex remains the rule in many a sector. She points to the waiters at fancy restaurants and the waitresses at unfancy ones. Could antidiscrimination lawsuits take the place of affirmative action, as Mr. Eastland and Mr. Bolick advocate? She explains that antidiscrimination lawsuits help so few and take so many years as to be a model of ineffectiveness. Does affirmative action stigmatize blacks? Not as much as if blacks disappeared from lofty positions, which might tend to happen without affirmative action. Does affirmative action sometimes lead to ridiculous appointments? She regrets foolish applications of principle. Does affirmative action harm the economy? She notes that the largest corporations favor the policy -- doubtless in part because they wish to expand the talent pool.
Ms. Bergmann is reluctant to make what I see as a main point, which is that affirmative action has already proved its value -- even if not to such a degree as to render the program outdated. Affirmative action has been something like the G.I. Bill after World War II. It has done precious little for the very poor, but it has helped to expand and integrate the middle-class work force. In the case of the G.I. Bill, no one resented the G.I.'s, and the bill's champions never had to search for universal justifications. But affirmative action has had its enemies, and its friends have responded by working up grandiose arguments on its behalf, and the grandiose arguments have pointed the policy in ever more misguided directions, as duly noted by its critics. But in its narrowest form, as a temporary program for blacks and women, affirmative action remains defensible -- or so I conclude, having read the lively disputations of Ms. Bergmann, Mr. Eastland and Mr. Bolick.

THE FUTURE OF CAPITALISM
How Today's Economic Forces Shape Tomorrow's World.
By Lester C. Thurow.
385 pp. New York:
William Morrow & Company. $25.
Around the time when nuclear Armageddon was indefinitely postponed, Westerners suddenly started to worry about environmental catastrophe. Coincidence, perhaps. But when Marxism collapses and then capitalists promptly start to fear the effects of their own economic system, one begins to suspect a pattern. The West, it seems, needs a threat to worry about these days, and if no external danger can be found, then one from within will have to do. In "The Future of Capitalism," by Lester C. Thurow, a populist professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, there are internal threats aplenty to keep capitalists shivering at night. 
 Economic statistics are the best thing that ever happened to compulsive worriers. If something is getting undeniably better, you can always measure something else that is getting inexorably worse. Every silver lining can be fitted out with a cloud, provided you are selective with your figures and careful to make the wrong comparisons.
Consider, for example, the remarkable and relatively recent blessing of economic growth. One might have thought that a rate of growth that is big enough to double the world's wealth in half a lifetime is pretty impressive -- especially given the fact that annual economic growth over most of human history has been approximately nothing. Yet Mr. Thurow finds a way to make our current performance seem not only disappointing but a harbinger of disaster. In the 1960's, he points out, the world economy grew at an average rate of 5 percent per year in real terms, but in 1990-95, he says, "the world could manage a growth rate of just 2.0 percent per year. In two decades capitalism lost 60 percent of its momentum." True. But what he does not say is that this 2 percent compounded over 35 years still doubles your money. A miracle that is smaller than yesterday's miracle is nonetheless a miracle.
As further evidence for the dire state of capitalism, Mr. Thurow bemoans the fact that wages for most American jobs have declined in real terms over the past 20 years. Again true, apparently, but again misleadingly incomplete. What about the millions of wage packets that did not even exist two decades ago? Mr. Thurow does mention the 38 million net new jobs created in America during this period, but he seems not to see their relevance. These are jobs that 20 years ago paid a wage of precisely $0. It would of course be nice if even more people could earn even more money. But if you want to judge capitalism, you must ask where we would now be without it, not where it might have got us in a perfect world.
Mr. Thurow has a good reason for accentuating the negative. He is selling a diagnosis and a solution, and nobody will buy either of these things without first being convinced that there is a problem. His diagnosis of capitalism's current plight involves two putative catch phrases from science: punctuated equilibrium and plate tectonics. The former refers to the occasional suddenness of biological evolution. In Mr. Thurow's hands, it simply means that winners can sometimes quickly become losers.
Plate tectonics explains dramatic geological phenomena in terms of the invisibly slow movements of the continental plates that float on the earth's core. As applied to economics by Mr. Thurow, this boils down to the thesis that the causes of events are sometimes hard to spot and can take a while to unfold. Put the two ideas together and you have a world economy in the throes of a fearsome mixed metaphor: the landscape of capitalism is slowly being shaped by hidden forces that will one day erupt and change everything before we know what has hit us -- unless, of course, we read this book.
Mr. Thurow sees five main economic "plates" in motion beneath us. The first is the collapse of Communism, which is unleashing a large supply of cheap and well-educated labor. The second is technology, which is creating a knowledge-based economy. The third is demography, with the rich world's aging population facing a tide of immigration from the poor world. The fourth is the growth of a global economy, which forces wages down (or up, depending on where you are standing). The fifth is the disappearance of a single globally dominant power, which Mr. Thurow argues is a bad development. Capitalism, he believes, is ill prepared to cope with the changes that these forces will produce. It is too individualist, short-termist and self-indulgent. Capitalist society produces imprudent and uncoordinated economic creatures who will topple into the chasms of our changing economic geology.
Some of Mr. Thurow's analyses are uncontroversially sound -- his description of the unresolved problem of paying for tomorrow's pensions, for example. Others seem to be written on automatic pilot -- as when he blames American television for inculcating the wrong values: "For the TV hero . . . there is no duty or sacrifice, no role for the community, no common good; all behavior is depicted as legitimate." So the bad guys usually win, do they? The "Baywatch" babes let people drown? Mr. Thurow must have been watching his own private channel.
He is unlikely to find much of an audience among academic economists for his sound-bite analysis of international trade. As in his earlier best seller, "Head to Head," Mr. Thurow presents trade as a competitive struggle among countries. Most economists regard this analogy between countries and corporations as profoundly misleading. It may sound intuitively plausible and be popular on the hustings, but intuition is no better guide to truth in economics than it is in physics. If politicians had had to stand for election on a platform of issues from physics, Aristotle's theory of motion would soon be enjoying its 2,400th year in office.
Mr. Thurow thinks he knows the kind of economy America needs in order to be successful in the tectonic upheavals to come. It would benefit, he urges, from a better-trained work force, and few would bother to disagree with him about that. But he is faced with a paradox. If the future is going to be as unpredictable as he claims, what is the point of trying to lay out a detailed strategy for success? In these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that his prognostications tend toward the vacuous: "While no one knows for certain the shape of the business organization of the future, we do know with certainty that the business organization of the future will be very different." Such remarks have the unmistakable ring of a bad speech after a good dinner.
What Mr. Thurow probably regards as his main message to capitalism (or rather to America, which is his real subject most of the time) is that it needs to replace its "consumption ideology" with a "builder's ideology." Individuals and companies must save more and spend less in order to construct for the future. And governments "must be active visible builders." But of what, exactly? Mr. Thurow is keen on Europe's intercity high-speed rail projects. He is also curiously admiring of the economy that built the pyramids. Of the ancient Egyptians he writes: "Today we marvel at the proportions of their total incomes and working time that must have effectively been collected in taxes to build the pyramids, but they undoubtedly took great pride in what they were doing." Does he really want us to swap wage slavery for actual slavery?
It is hard to see how Mr. Thurow's industrial strategy of picking winners -- of selecting industries and projects for governments to back -- can be squared with his view that the world is in for seismic change. How can you back tomorrow's winners if it is impossible to tell who they will be? That is not the only problem. The directed economy that he advocates conflicts with the very economic system that produced so much wealth that an annual growth of 2 percent now seems like peanuts. The heart of capitalism is its method of allocating resources according to market demand rather than the dictates of central planning. Why worry that free-market capitalism will stagnate and disappear if you are in effect advocating its abolition anyway?

Broker's Fee Right Contested
 
Q. My co-op was for sale subject to no financing, board approval and closing during 1995. The real estate broker had the buyer's lawyer prepare a contract that made the sale subject to financing. My wife, who is a co-owner, was omitted from the contract. A check with the buyer's signature was submitted for 10 percent of the purchase price. I refused the sale and sold it to another buyer for cash. The broker is demanding a commission, claiming that they had a ready, willing and able buyer. Is the broker entitled to a commission? . . . Irwin Sater, Glendale, Queens.
 
A. Saul L. Victor, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that it appears that the broker was orally hired by the seller to sell the apartment. Unless there is an agreement to the contrary, Mr. Victor said, a licensed real estate broker hired by a seller is entitled to a commission upon producing a buyer who is ready, willing and able to purchase on the terms proposed by the seller -- even if no contract is actually signed by all parties.
"The difficulty arises as a result of relying on an oral agreement," Mr. Victor said. The absence of a written agreement, he said, makes it difficult to determine whether the broker accepted the hiring subject to the conditions imposed by the seller.
"If the seller establishes that he had prescribed those conditions to the broker," Mr. Victor said, "the seller would be under no obligation to pay a commission since the contract submitted to the owner varied from those terms."
 
M.C.I. Rent Increase: Permanent or Not?
 
Q. My apartment is under rent control. My landlord installed windows under the major-capital-improvement program and received a rent increase of $21.40 a month. The increase went into effect on April 1, 1991. Is a major capital improvement increase a permanent part of the tenant's rent or should it be eliminated after the amortization is complete? Should an M.C.I. increase that started on April 1, 1991 -- and was amortized over five years -- be eliminated on April 1, 1996? . . . Raymond Krell, Brooklyn.
 
A. Peter Schwartz, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant matters, said that a major-capital-improvement increase that is approved by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal becomes a permanent part of the base rent of an apartment.
"A major-capital-improvement increase is designed to provide an incentive to owners to improve their buildings," Mr. Schwartz said. "And there are strict rules that govern such increases."
For example, he said, an M.C.I. increase can only be obtained for a buildingwide improvement that can be documented as an actual improvement as opposed to routine maintenance. Generally, he said, such increases are calculated by dividing the cost of the improvement by an "amortization period" set by law. In 1991, Mr. Schwartz said, the amortization period was five years; currently it is seven years.
The resulting figure is then divided by the total number of rooms in the building to determine the per-room increase. Mr. Schwartz added that an M.C.I. increase is limited by the 6 percent per-year cap imposed by the rent laws.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 5, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An answer in the Q&A column on April 14, about rent increases tied to major capital improvements, referred imprecisely to limits on such payments. Major-capital-improvement increases for tenants in rent-stabilized apartments are limited to a maximum of 6 percent a year. For tenants covered by the rent-control program, which applies to pre-1947 apartments in which tenancy has not changed since 1971, the maximum is 15 percent a year.

ASHES TO ASHES
America's Hundred-Year Cigarette War, the Public Health and the Unabashed Triumph of Philip Morris
By Richard Kluger
807 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $35.
At the end of "Ashes to Ashes," his mammoth history of the American tobacco industry, Richard Kluger writes of his sources that his most difficult task was "to try to suspend moral judgment as long as possible in sifting through this immense and untidy collection of materials in order to craft a coherent social narrative about an industry that was, after all, a thriving enterprise well before a conclusive scientific consensus on the hazards of its products was achieved." 
 One has to admire him for this. To be impartial about smoking cannot have been easy given the extreme change in attitude during the last four decades from general acceptance of what was looked upon as a pleasurable if annoying habit to widespread condemnation of what has come to be seen as a killing addiction.
 Yet he has succeeded very well. On the one hand, he tells the story of an industry with a highly profitable product that it saw as no better or worse in moral terms than that of any other industry. As Mr. Kluger writes it, that industry's main challenges were at first to sell this product to more and more users, and then increasingly to fend off meddlesome critics who began denouncing the harmfulness of the product on the basis of evidence that the industry viewed as purely conjectural.
Indeed, Mr. Kluger succeeds so well at being morally impartial that the tone of his narrative is almost celebratory as he traces how Philip Morris began as a Bond Street boutique that supplied tobacco to the English crown and became, through brilliant sales technique and clever diversification, America's biggest food company in the 1990's.
At the same time, he describes the agonizingly slow process by which critics of the tobacco industry established that cigarettes might be unhealthful and then gradually prevailed on the Government to take the most minimal steps both to warn consumers and to control the manufacturers.
Unfortunately, Mr. Kluger's objectivity is what prevents the reader from being fully caught up by his narrative. For while you may admire his impartiality in principle, to experience that objectivity from page to page in the light of what smoking has come to mean today is repugnant in the extreme. Despite all Mr. Kluger's efforts to make several of the tobacco industry's leaders appear charming and creative, they rarely seem better than calculating merchants of death.
In fact, so skewed does Mr. Kluger's viewpoint become in his striving for disinterestedness that he is forced to overpraise the smallest virtue. For instance, he calls one Philip Morris executive "visionary" simply for writing in response to the United States Surgeon General's 1964 report on the ill effects of smoking that "greater benefit will accrue from accepting the report's findings on face value and proceeding to the cure of ills, real and alleged as they may be, than from engaging in disputation and refutation of those claims." Realistic, yes, but "visionary"?
What is perhaps most disturbing about reading this minutely detailed volume -- at least to someone who smoked his way through three decades of Mr. Kluger's 100-year history -- is to learn how completely manipulated one was. Not only is "Ashes to Ashes" another report of the banality of evil, it is also an exercise in horrifying nostalgia. No cigarette brand is mentioned without its slogan or jingle coming instantly to memory! And then comes the humiliating discovery that you were always smoking exactly the brand that the most successful manufacturer at a given time wanted you to.
Several sections of the book are engrossing simply as well-narrated history: the account of the Rose Cipollone case, in which a lung-cancer victim unsuccessfully sued the cigarette industry for liability; the story of R. Ross Johnson's attempt at a leveraged buy-out of RJR-Nabisco, previously told in the best-selling book "Barbarians at the Gate," by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, and the parts relating how secondhand smoke, or so-called environmental tobacco smoke, was finally established as hazardous.
But mainly "Ashes to Ashes" inspires moral outrage. If ever Marx was right about economic interest being the ground of human behavior! The enormity of the story told here suggests that only slavery exceeds tobacco as a curse on American history.
Finally, even Mr. Kluger throws up his hands, concluding that the only way to resolve the conflict between smoking and human health is to cut a deal with the tobacco manufacturers. In exchange for exempting them from all personal injury claims by smokers, let them agree to a set of restrictions that would minimize the damage done by smoking as much as possible.
As Mr. Kluger concludes his important but profoundly depressing book, "Such a rational and civilized remedy, though, is probably too much to hope for as slayer of an incubus that has defied all reason, thrived on greed and folly, and driven poor mortals to grasp onto it for succor in a fashion their Maker never designed their bodies to long endure."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Veteran Saxophonists Show More Than Age

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS 

 BODY:
Against the blank canvas of a neutral rhythm section, eight of the better improvisers in jazz grappled in a cutting contest at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday. Called "Battle Royale: Trumpets and Tenors 2," it was the public face of what the writer Albert Murray has named "antagonistic cooperation," where musicians, challenged by their peers, ape pushed into further excellence. For the audience at the sold-out concert, few situations offered a better environment to investigate the differe'ces among great improvisers.
And what became clear during the long show was that age in jazz can often be an indication of musical knowledge. The saxophonists, Von Freeman, Teddy Edwards, Johnny Griffin and Joe Lovano (the first three hovering around their seventh decade), played with so much information and wit that the audience was left in awe of the music and not the physicality of the performance. 
 The same can't be said of the performance of the trumpeters, Jon Faddis, Wynton Marsalis, Roy Hargrove and Nicholas Payton, who hammered away at each other with high notes and volume. The intent was not so much to perform well as to perform better than the others. And oddly, though the trumpeters were in some cases nearly 50 years younger than the saxophonists, they brought less harmonic and rhythmic daring to the session.
Cutting sessions "were always the way that musicians played for themselves," Mr. Edwards said before the concert; he is one of jazz's most imposing improvisers, but he lives in Los Angeles, and so is mostly unknown on the East Coast. "When we played, it was friendly competition. We didn't try and cut heads and leave blood on the floor, and we didn't resort to playing to the audience. The sessions were always about exploration."
For Mr. Edwards, who is celebrating his 60th year as a professional musician, cutting sessions are a part of his musical makeup. As a boy in Mississippi, he remembers a saxophonist from Milwaukee coming through town "chopping heads," using a harmonically advanced style; he sent Mr. Edwards toward a lifelong study of harmony. When Mr. Edwards moved to Detroit as a young musician, he spent a good portion of his time at a club, the Bandbox, where players gained their reputations by facing off against one another. There were economic implications: the best were heard and hired by local band leaders.
And when Mr. Edwards moved to Los Angeles, he was part of the flourishing musical culture of Central Avenue during the 1940's, when he, Wardell Gray and Dexter Gordon held all-night jam sessions that have become legendary.
"You trade ideas and see if you can come up to the level," Mr. Edwards said. "Sometimes you fall short. It's a funny thing, one night it would be my night, the next Dexter's or Lucky Thompson's or Wardell's. Whatever happened, the next day you got up, put on a pot of beans and practiced all day."
Friday was in part Mr. Edwards's night; being a virtual unknown in New York, he had the most to gain, and against formidable competition he showed up his compatriots on the blues "Walkin' " and on the ballad "Tenderly."
The rest of the saxophonists have had plenty of experience proving themselves in competitive circumstances. Mr. Griffin made a series of records with John Coltrane, Hank Mobley and Eddie (Lockjaw) Davis. Mr. Lovano, the youngest of the group at 44, spent years playing jam sessions in Cleveland as a youth. Mr. Freeman still leads a jam session at his regular weekly show in Chicago.
For the musicians, cutting sessions were most often behind closed doors, where the musicians, after working their regular jobs at night retired to perform for themselves, to experiment and play, in the profound sense of the word.
"I don't think you need an audience," Mr. Freeman said. "Generally the people want musicians to out-blow each other, and the one high note or low note that gets the audience doesn't have anything to do with what's really happening onstage."
While this is all generous, competition still exists, and nobody wants to walk out a loser.
"Sure, I'm competitive," Mr. Faddis said. "I play my best spurred on by others, and also by the crowd. I have tricks I use, high notes for example. That's part of who I am."
Mr. Marsalis agreed.
"No matter what anybody says, nobody wants their head served to them," he said. "It has happened to everybody, and nobody likes it. Musicians are like athletes, they're not going to say, 'We're here to kill the other team.' They say, 'We're going to try and play our best,' by which they mean they're not planning to lose. And I know this: Everybody will be prepared."
Of the four trumpeters, Mr. Payton, the youngest and the least known, had the most to gain. And on several pieces, his playing seemed the least keyed to intimidate. The trumpeters, in the exchanges, were all forced to deal with Mr. Faddis's enormous power and facility; Mr. Marsalis tried to match him and failed. The performances became a game of strategy, how to draw the other musicians onto one s own territory, to expose weaknesses. A high fast flurry, perhaps unanswerable, was met by long low notes. A searing run was answered by careful melodies.
And Mr. Payton, playing with a big, rich sound, managed just to improvise, with heat and intelligence, relying less on what the trumpeters around him were playing, and letting his solos open up. It was competitive, but more at the service of the music.
"I love jam sessions," he said. "They open your ears to interaction. You can play in a way which to me embodies the creative spirit that the music is about."

HEADLINE: New York Area Is Forging Ahead In New Media

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The new-media industry in New York has more than doubled in the last three years to become a $3.8 billion-a-year business and a mainstay of the metropolitan economy, according to a study to be released today.
The metropolitan-area industry is a sprawling collection of more than 4,200 companies -- mainly small, entrepreneurial companies that develop and market Internet sites, multimedia software, on-line entertainment and other digital offerings. The fledgling companies in this new field are not household names, but together they now employ more workers in the city than traditional media industries like television, book publishing or newspapers, according to the study. 
Conducted by the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand and paid for by the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency, the study represents a rigorous effort to measure the size and growth of the industry in New York.
Previous attempts to gauge the advance of the industry have tended to rely on indicators like the growth of the New York New Media Association, a trade group founded in 1994 that currently has 2,100 individual members.
Total new-media employment in metropolitan New York, including nearby counties in New Jersey and Connecticut, was 71,500 workers last year, up from 28,500 in 1992. Apparently, New York is in a close race with San Francisco to be the nation's leader in the field. A study by the Bay Area Multimedia Partnership, a corporate and government group, reported last year that the nine-county area around San Francisco had more than 2,200 new-media companies supporting more than 62,000 workers.
The industry has flourished in New York because of the city's ample pool of young designers, artists, writers and programmers, fluent in digital technology and thus able to take advantage of the rapid spread of personal computers and the Internet. The industry has also been helped by the presence of so many traditional media companies, which are making experimental forays into new media. The new-media subsidiaries of traditional companies were also included in the study.
Government policy has not played much of a role in the industry's growth. Yet one motivation for the new-media study, which included surveys and interviews, was to find out if there were steps that state and local governments might take to foster the development of the local industry. And the 57-page report recommended possible measures such as reduced taxes, investment incentives for new-media companies and the encouragement of investment in high-speed data lines.
The entrepreneurs in the field said they have scant interest in government help. "I want less government, not more," said Jeffrey Dachis, the 29-year-old co-founder and chief executive of Razorfish Inc. in New York, which designs sites on the Internet's World Wide Web for big companies. "I want the city and state to lower taxes and provide services more efficiently," he said. "But I do not want government to get into this business by offering targeted tax breaks and other incentives."
Government officials generally agreed, saying steps taken to encourage the industry should be limited. "The government role should be mainly to create an environment conducive to entrepreneurial activity, and get out of the way," said Peter Powers, the First Deputy Mayor of New York City.
As an example of action the city and state can take, Mr. Powers pointed to the New York Information Technology Center at 55 Broad Street in Manhattan's financial district. With private investment, encouraged by real estate and rental tax abatements, the office tower once occupied by the junk-bond firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, has been converted to inexpensive space for new-media companies. The first occupants moved in this year.
The hub of the region's industry is in so-called Silicon Alley, which the Coopers & Lybrand study defined broadly as all new-media companies south of 41st Street in Manhattan. The 700 companies there employ the equivalent of 18,000 full-time workers (the study counted two part-time workers as one full-time worker). These companies often focus on creative work by digital artists, designers and writers, while purchasing equipment and services from computer and telecommunications companies.
And the Silicon Alley crowd is optimistic. The study estimated that employment there would more than double to 39,000 from 1996 to 1998.
Traditional media companies take a more cautious approach, but they too are placing bets in this new field. "It isn't a mass market yet and there are a lot of unknowns, including the careers of all the people involved," said Paul Sagan, president and editor of new media at Time Inc., owned by Time Warner Inc., whose ventures include the Pathfinder news service on the Internet.
"But we think this is going to be a big business someday," Mr. Sagan added. "And that's why we're staying in it and continuing to invest."

HEADLINE: James C. Turner, 79, Laborer Who Rose to Union Presidency

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
James Castle Turner, a former laborer and college boxer who became president of the International Union of Operating Engineers and championed racial integration in the union movement, died on Saturday at the Day Shore Convalescent Center in North Miami Beach, Fla. He was 79.
He lived in Washington from 1931 to 1988 and later moved to Florida. 
 Mr. Turner, who was generally known as J. C., had suffered a series of strokes and had been in ill health for several years, his daughter Lauran Gintel said.
He was president of the 400,000-member Operating Engineers, whose members are mainly operators of heavy equipment in the construction industry, from 1975 to 1985, when he retired.
Mr. Turner was also influential in civic life in Washington, where he was an advocate of home rule and affirmative action as well as integration. While in Washington, he earned the nickname "Mr. Labor." He had been a member of the Democratic National Committee and the Washington City Council and had headed the Greater Washington Area Central Labor Council.
Over the years he was active in civil rights and charitable organizations. He had been treasurer of the National Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a trustee of the National Urban League and chairman of United Way International.
The son of an ironworker, he was born in Beaumont, Tex. Mr. Turner was a laborer in east Texas before attending Catholic University, where he was on the boxing team and in 1940 received a bachelor's degree in economics. Having become a member of his union in the 1930's, he rose through the ranks to the presidency.
In 1978, Mr. Turner was among a group of leaders of unions and consumer organizations who criticized the Carter Administration's emerging anti-inflation program. The group contended that the program was unfair to workers and was unlikely to succeed.
In 1981, Mr. Turner was on the executive council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Bal Harbour, Fla., which decided that unions should make their voices heard in the selection of candidates for political office.
In addition to his daughter, Lauran, of Houston, he is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Mary Pauline Curtis; two other daughters, Vivian Polak of Delray Beach, Fla., and Lisa Oshins of Santa Barbara, Calif.; two sons, Daniel, of Columbia, Md., and Brian, of Washington; nine grandchildren, and a brother, Melvin, of Brownsville, Tex.

HEADLINE: Government Dexterity Eases Misery for Iraqis

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 14

 BODY:
All of a sudden, Bala Abdullah Khalil, a mother of seven, can afford to heap rice on her children's plates in quantities she could not conceive of a few months ago.
Even meat and eggs are no longer out of the question; the Iraqi dinar is worth nearly five times what it was when the year began. And like the dinar itself, Mrs. Khalil's spirits have been buoyed by expectations that life in Iraq, a grim struggle after more than five years of United Nations sanctions, may soon get a little bit better. 
 "God willing, we will get to sell our oil," she said at the stand where she peddles dry goods on one of Baghdad's main streets, referring to a plan that could allow Iraq to begin selling large amounts of oil abroad for the first time since it invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and became an international pariah.
After weeks of talks in New York, Iraq and the United Nations appear close to an agreement on the renewable plan, which would allow Iraq to sell $1 billion worth of oil every 90 days but strictly limit how the proceeds could be used. And already, the Iraqi Government has capitalized on hopes for a breakthrough as part of a deft campaign that has put the country's sanctions-starved economy on firmer footing.
"What Iraq has given itself is the ability to take a deep breath," one Western diplomat said of three-month effort, during which prices have plunged and goods have flooded to market. It is estimated to have replenished the Iraqi treasury with between $300 million and $2 billion in precious hard currency.
Unable to earn hard currency under the United Nations sanctions, which bar exports and all imports except food and medicine, Iraq remains deeply troubled. In the capital, ragged children and elderly women beg for handouts at intersections, and the World Health Organization said in a recent report that the sanctions have left most Iraqis with inadequate diets and have set back health care in the country by half a century.
Because Iraq rejected similar offers in the past, its abrupt turnabout in January that led to the talks on the plan for limited oil sales is seen by diplomats here as a sign of desperation. With the value of the dinar dropping to an all-time low of 3,000 to the dollar in December, they say the Iraqi Government found itself particularly taxed by the mounting cost of the food it imports to provide people with a basic ration, with the bill projected to reach $2 billion this year.
Iraqi officials including Hikmat al-Azawi, who took over in December as the country's Finance Minister, have publicly acknowledged the need to take what Mr. Azawi has called "quick and drastic steps." While diplomats say the current surge is in many respects artificial, they say the measures Iraq has used have been very effective.
Among them have been a campaign in newspapers and television that led thousands of Iraqis who had been hoarding dollars as protection against the crippling rate of inflation to exchange their $100 bills for dinars out of fear that they would no longer be valid after the introduction of the new $100 note.
"American Cancels $100 Bill," said the headline in the state-run Al-Jumhuriya newspaper. Another newspaper published a photograph of an old $100 bill that had been crossed out in bold black ink.
The value of the Iraqi currency began to climb with the announcement by President Saddam Hussein in late December that the country would cease to print dinars in a bid to tackle inflation.
About the same time, Iraq began to release stockpiles of flour, sugar and other foods to market, then transformed a field near an old Baghdad airport into a vast used-car lot as part of public commitment to sell one-fourth of all state property. Those steps have helped to drive prices down and set off a buying spree that diplomats say the Government used to pull millions of dinars out of circulation, pushing the currency's value even higher.
Since Iraq announced abruptly in January that it was willing to begin talks with the United Nations about the oil-sale plan, its official media has whetted the public appetite by giving great prominence to the negotiations.
For traders like Shafik Madr, the consequences have been nothing short of dramatic.
In the days just after the announcement, thousands of dollars a day poured into his branch alone. The scene was repeated at exchange shops across the city as people whose savings were being eroded by the hour rushed to trade greenbacks for the surging national currency.
Even without limitations imposed by the United Nations , the $4 billion annual influx of oil revenue would represent only one-fourth of what Iraq earned before the Persian Gulf war as the world's second-largest exporter of oil. But it could help considerably to ease the strains on the economy, and ordinary citizens are clearly getting used to a stronger dinar, whose value has leapt nearly 10 percent, from 700 to 620 to the dollar, in the last 24 hours amid optimistic reports from New York that have stoked anticipation of a deal that would allow Iraqi oil to begin flowing again."
"Now I can give my kids bigger portions and a lot more to eat," said Mrs. Khalil, who has watched the price of most basic foods plunge even more drastically than the dinar has surged. "Milk, eggs, even meat -- I couldn't afford any of those things before."
A tray of 30 eggs now goes for 1,500 dinars, down from 5,750 at the beginning of the year. But the new price is still nearly one-third of a month's salary for an average Iraqi, whose main subsistence comes from a Government-supplied ration package that international aid agencies say is woefully insufficient.
"Everyone is waiting for good news from New York,"' said Mr. Madr, the currency trader. "Everyone is eager once again to taste the fruits of Iraq."

HEADLINE: City Tries Again to Set Up Manhattan Concrete Plant

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
Ten years ago, in a novel plan to lower construction costs and damage the Mafia, the city began subsidizing a private concrete company in Manhattan. But the plan dissolved last year after the company, $4 million in debt and beset by managerial disputes, collapsed in bankruptcy.
Now, the Giuliani administration is reviving the idea. Vowing not to repeat the mistakes of previous administrations, it has begun advertising for a new company to open a plant on city-owned property and become the sole concrete supplier for all municipal construction projects in Manhattan. 
 City officials estimate that the deal would be worth at least $3 million a year in gross sales for the company that wins the contract.
Richard J. Schwartz, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's senior adviser, said that despite past problems, the administration was confident it could find a qualified contractor. "There is no reason to give up on this project, because it is valid if executed properly with the appropriate operator," Mr. Schwartz said.
But Francis X. McArdle, the head of a major contractors' trade group in the city, said that the revised plan was doomed to become another economic corpse. Mr. McArdle, the managing director of the General Contractors Association of New York, said that no qualified contractor would open a concrete plant in Manhattan because no site there is large enough to store supplies and provide parking for a fleet of huge concrete-delivery trucks.
"I do not believe the city will find an experienced operator who will be able to run a competitive full-service plant in Manhattan," Mr. McArdle said.
Since there are no concrete manufacturers in Manhattan, concrete is brought in by trucks, mainly from plants in Brooklyn and Queens.
In the 1980's, evidence that Mafia families controlled the city's multimillion-dollar concrete industry was produced at Federal trials, including several cases handled by Mr. Giuliani when he was the United States Attorney in Manhattan.
Acting on the disclosures, the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch conceived the idea for a city-sponsored concrete plant as a way to prevent mob-run companies from rigging bids and inflating municipal construction costs.
In 1986, a new company, the West 57th Street Concrete Corporation, was awarded the first contract. It built a plant on a rent-free three-acre site at West 57th Street and the Hudson River. The key to the deal was the company's exclusive right for five years to provide concrete at fixed prices for all city projects in Manhattan. In 1991, the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins renewed the contract through 1996.
Last May, the plant closed when the city bought the bankrupt company's equipment for $152,000 and began allowing contractors on municipal jobs in Manhattan to buy their concrete from any supplier they wanted, just as they had done before 1986.
For more than a year before its closing, the bankrupt company, under a court-appointed trustee, was still operating. But instead of producing concrete, it hired other companies to supply city contractors.
"We were very unsatisfied with the arrangement," Mr. Schwartz said, "because the operator was simply collecting a middleman's fee for subcontracting to companies that he was supposed to be competing with."
City officials said the West 57th Street company flopped because it had been mismanaged and its original owners had no experience in concrete production.
Former executives of the company claimed that the business was undermined by a private construction slump in the last decade that made the plant unprofitable. They said that city contracts alone could not support the company.
In advertisements that began on Friday in newspapers and trade journals, the city announced that concrete producers could obtain details from the Mayor's Office of Construction about competing for the contract. Mr. Schwartz said that the city would turn over the West 57th Street site or another waterfront area for the proposed plant.
The plant must be located on the East River or Hudson River because barges are the most inexpensive method of transporting the sand, gravel, cement and other materials needed to manufacture concrete.
Mr. Schwartz said the new contract would also allow the company to obtain extra revenue by supplying private construction needs in the city. Companies that bid for the contract will have to show city investigators that they have no mob ties or questionable backgrounds.
Mr. McArdle of the contractors' association said that by giving one company an exclusive right to municipal contracts, the city was creating a monopoly that might raise prices instead of lowering them. "They are trying to resuscitate an impractical plan that died of its own accord and will probably meet the same fate again," he said.

Thrift Is Back!

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Fear itself that nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror of a poverty-stricken old age -- has done a wonderful thing this year. Politicians are competing to stimulate a value that had all but disappeared in a blizzard of credit cards: thrift.
Part of the fear is the media angst-du-jour of downsizing, outsourcing and scrapheaping that makes every middle manager feel like Deadwood Dick. This opsiphobia -- fear of prosperity, like that afflicting investors -- has imbued our good times with a Kierkegaardian dread of career crashes. 
 Couple this irrational fear with one rooted in reality: that when we get old, the next generation of taxpayers is not going to let the Government take such good care of us.
Remember how Social Security was going to take care of our basic needs, while Medicare was going to pay middle-class medical bills? As that prospect diminishes, the thought is crossing Americans' minds that it might be a good idea to have a little personal nest egg.
A short generation ago, with inflation roaring along in double digits, it was smarter to borrow than to save. But now, in a low-inflation era, credit is discredited, and saving is no longer a stupid investment decision.
The confluence of fears led to a ceremony in the Rose Garden last week that was all too quickly dismissed as election-year politicking. Bill Clinton unveiled his "Retirement Savings and Security Act," proposals to give tax breaks to workers willing to save for retirement, and rules making it easier for more businesses to set up inviolable pension and matching retirement accounts.
Republicans were stupefied because most of these ideas promoting individual self-reliance were in their budget proposal, which President Clinton recently vetoed. Just as he acceded philosophically to the G.O.P.'s demands for a balanced budget, the Marvelous Malleable Man acceded practically to its ideas for letting people keep more of their earnings for nest eggs. This is the Clinton strategy of victory though surrender, and it's driving the G.O.P. batty.
Forget the politics; that's not the big story. Look at what's happening in our society: Democrats have joined Republicans in realizing that most Americans feel the need to take care of themselves when they grow old. The Government can't; the kids won't. Who does that leave?
The individual geezer of tomorrow, that's who. And the greatest geezer-pleaser around is the Individual Retirement Account, that device that rewards workers with a tax credit now for creating nest eggs. Its close cousin is the 401(k) scheme of putting income aside, supplementing it with an employer contribution, and using the interest and profit from the investment not to pay taxes but to make more money. You pay a lower tax rate after you stop earning.
Given a selfish reason to save, you'll save. If you put those untouchable savings into a broad stock index fund, history has shown you'll average 10 percent a year. If you let your chips lie long enough without having to pay the tax man every year, you'll come out way, way ahead.
With this new self-reliance in the saddle, both parties are coming up with improvements in retirement savings plans. Raising I.R.A. limits is good; so is making portable and immediately eligibile your 401(k) (and can't we find a better name for joint retirement funds?).
One bad idea is Clinton's notion to open the funds for investments in new homes, education expenses, which would lead to exceptions for face lifts and dance lessons and whatall. That defeats the very purpose of retirement accounts, which should be gold for the golden years. The aim is to encourage saving, not to have government direct spending. Keep it focused; make medical savings accounts a separate next step.
Credit White House pollsters with sensitivity to what the people fear, and credit the President with a breathtaking ability to turn on a dime to seize the moment. Cut the Republican grumping about Clinton's repackaging of conservative proposals; Bob Dole should send up his own geezer-pleaser quickly, while the newest Clinton is still steering to starboard.
What we are witnessing is nothing less than retirement reform. Never mind that the midwife is the public's fear, real and imagined, of government inadequacy or economic squeeze. Hail the rebirth of thrift.

HEADLINE: In America;
Freedom Birds

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Nearly three years ago, in the pre-dawn darkness of June 6, 1993, a tramp steamer called the Golden Venture ran aground in the rough surf off the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens.
The rusting, 150-foot freighter was loaded with nearly 300 illegal Chinese immigrants who had agreed to pay up to $30,000 each to be smuggled into the United States. Panic set in when the ship ran aground. Terrified immigrants began plunging into the frigid water, desperately trying to avoid arrest by swimming what seemed like the final yards to a long-held dream of freedom. 
 Ten people drowned. More than 250 were arrested. A handful made it to shore and escaped, ragged and soaking wet, into the limitless sanctuary of New York.
On the second floor of 70 Mulberry Street in Chinatown is a small facility known as the Museum of Chinese in the Americas. One of its current exhibitions is "Fly to Freedom: The Art of the Golden Venture Refugees."
Most of the men and women who were arrested when the ship ran aground are still incarcerated, awaiting adjudication of their requests for asylum, which are being processed at a torturously slow rate. They are being held at various detention centers around the country. Many of the men were sent to the York County Jail in York, Pa. It is their works of art, elaborate paper constructions initially created to alleviate boredom and to provide tokens of gratitude for attorneys working pro bono on their behalf, that are on display at the museum.
These are not ordinary artworks. They are dreamlike expressions of extreme social and cultural isolation painstakingly fashioned from objects commonly available to inmates. As Winston Dong, the museum's executive director, explained, that means toilet paper, towel threads, magazines, writing paper, pencils, pens and Magic Markers.
The theme throughout is freedom. Some of the detainees have said they fled China because they were being persecuted for participating in pro-democracy demonstrations. Others said they had been denied religious freedom because they were Christian. Some said they had violated China's one-child-per-couple family planning policy, and were afraid they would be involuntarily sterilized and perhaps imprisoned. Some, no doubt, were economic refugees. The United States is still the finish line in the race for opportunities of every kind.
No one who boarded the Golden Venture ever imagined that he or she would spend nearly three years in the maddening confines of an American jail cell. At York, the men did the best they could with the endless hours. They began to tear small pieces of paper and fold them into various shapes. They worked and reworked the paper into simple figures, pineapples, for example, and then more complex figures, like eagles, which they called "freedom birds."
The pastime caught on. The men were not allowed sharp objects like knives or forks. They used magazine inserts and plastic spoons to help shape their constructions. Eventually they were entrusted with Elmer's glue and children's scissors. They worked a dozen hours a day or more, creating ever more complex and symbolic works.
Visitors to the museum will see bird cages with freedom birds trapped inside, and a Statue of Liberty made from toilet paper, cardboard and magic marker, and a cheerful foot-and-a-half-high model of the Golden Venture, which in reality was a decrepit vessel with little in the way of rations and just one toilet for some 300 people.
The plight of the Golden Venture refugees led to the creation of a support group in the city of York called the People of the Golden Vision. It is an odd alliance. Many, if not most, of the members of the support group are politically conservative. They might be expected to be deaf to the pleas of illegal immigrants.
But the complaints of the Golden Venture refugees center on issues that resonate with American conservatives -- enforced abortions to limit the size of Chinese families, the crackdown that followed the Tiananmen Square uprising, the harassment of Chinese Christians.
A few of the refugees have been granted asylum. Some have given up and returned to China. Those who are still imprisoned, the majority, have become increasingly discouraged, even despondent. Depressed, the men in the York County Jail have stopped making their paper constructions.

HEADLINE: New Leader at Helm of the Microsoft Network

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Russell Siegelman, who guided the Microsoft Network, or MSN, on-line service from its inception to a subscriber base of more than a million users, said on Friday that he was stepping down to pursue other interests within the Microsoft Corporation.
Mr. Siegelman will be succeeded by Laura Jennings, who was named vice president of the Microsoft Network on Friday. Ms. Jennings, who joined MSN as executive producer last fall, previously was in charge of developing software that enabled groups of workers to collaborate. 
 The departure of Mr. Siegelman, who is 33, comes as the Microsoft Network is coming under increasing criticism from its business partners. Initially designed as a private network to rival America Online, MSN was revamped in December, less than four months after its debut, as a World Wide Web service.
The transition required more than 400 information providers, including large companies like NBC, to scrap their MSN development efforts, often at great expense, and start over creating Web-based services. Microsoft officials said the rise of the Internet forced it to change its original strategy, which in turn forced the changes for its partners.
"It's a mess over there, and I don't blame Russ for leaving," said Jesse Berst, editorial director of Windows Watcher, an industry newsletter published in Redmond, Wash. "Boy, what a cold, cold thing they did to the independent content providers."
Mr. Siegelman said the dispute with content providers had little to do with his decision to step down. "I feel very positive about what we achieved," he said. "It's been three years of lots of hard work, and we just made our million subscribers. It seemed like a logical time for me to think about something new."
He said he would work with the journalist Michael Kinsley to help develop an on-line political magazine for the Microsoft Network.
"I think they are looking to change their image from top to bottom," said Allen Weiner, an analyst at Dataquest Inc. who looks at companies whose business is linked to the Internet. "Russ was the most visible incarnation of the early MSN. In order for the company to move forward, they had to have a new leader."
Ms. Jennings, who is 34, studied engineering and received a master's degree in business from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University before joining Microsoft in 1988.

HEADLINE: An Era Passes at One Place That Fed the Civil Rights Struggle

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 14

 BODY:
They will still be serving Mister Robert's famous fried chicken. Miss Sherman, the one and only Orah Belle Sherman, will still show customers to their tables. And waitresses named Ophelia and Alma and Shirley will continue to call them honey and darling while pouring more tea.
But everyone agrees: Paschal's will never be the same. 
 Fifty years after James and Robert Paschal first opened a lunch counter on Hunter Street, just west of downtown, the two brothers have sold the hotel, restaurant and nightclub complex that fed and housed the civil rights movement and later became a mandatory campaign stop for politicians black and white.
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. loved the vegetable soup. "Miss Sherman, I'll take my usual," he would say. John Lewis, who now represents Atlanta in Congress, remembers when the cash-poor leaders of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee could get a plate of fried chicken, yams and early peas for little more than a dollar. (Even today, it would cost only $5.75 at Paschal's, pronounced PASS-culls.)
Julian Bond recalls the day in 1960 when the Paschals provided free meals to him and 76 other sit-in protesters right after they made bail. Miss Sherman, who has worked at Paschal's for 33 of her 77 years, tells of doing her own little bit for integration by seating whites and blacks at the same tables when Ramsey Lewis and Aretha Franklin packed them in at Paschal's La Carousel lounge. "The next thing I'd know they'd be buying each other rounds," she said.
Maynard H. Jackson, whose campaign to become Atlanta's first black mayor was sustained by the restaurant's smothered chicken and short ribs, said the sale of Paschal's to nearby Clark Atlanta University signified "the passing of an era."
"There was so much strategizing and planning and fund raising and praying and hoping going on in Paschal's about our collective struggle for justice and equal rights that the floorboards virtually reek of memories," said Mr. Jackson, who ultimately served three terms as Mayor, the first starting in 1974. "Anybody who was anybody came through Paschal's. It was like a rite of passage."
The university, which bought out the Paschals for about $3 million last month, has pledged to maintain the restaurant and its menu and staff while converting the hotel into a student residence and campus conference center. But many Atlantans fear that the sale will forever alter the ambience of a place where everyone is called brother or doctor or reverend.
"It might just not be Paschal's," said the Rev. Gerald L. Durley, president of Concerned Black Clergy, which has met at the unpretentious 600-seat restaurant every Monday morning for the last 15 years. "Paschal's was in the food, in the drapes, in the atmosphere, in the 'Hey, Doc, how you doing?' "
It is also in the history. "Dr. King used to have a special suite here that he would occupy," James Paschal said. "And many times after the marches -- the Poor People's March, the March on Washington -- he would come by and his lieutenants would get together here to plan their next strategy."
When Dr. King was assassinated, in 1968, the place got so crowded that the Paschals had to close the doors. "It was something else," Miss Sherman said. "Everybody was crying, the waitresses. When you see a group of men crying, you know it's something."
In later years, candidates and elected officials regularly dropped by what Mr. Lewis calls "the Paschal's precinct" to greet the regulars and gauge the political climate in the black population. Jimmy Carter came. So did Edmund S. Muskie and Gary Hart and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson.
Marvin Arrington, the president of the Atlanta City Council, said he grew up politically at Paschal's. "You got a chance to meet Adam Clayton Powell, Shirley Chisholm, Stokely Carmichael, Rap Brown," he said. "It was just a great place."
Robert Paschal, 86, and James Paschal, 73 say they sold the place only because they were getting on in years and could not persuade their children to take the reins. Business, they say, has been just fine.
But many of Atlanta's black politicians and civil rights veterans argue that Paschal's gradually lost its niche as blacks gained political and economic power in Atlanta. Twenty-three years after Mr. Jackson's first election, the power lunches now take place in white-linen business clubs atop shiny new skyscrapers. The fund-raisers are held in ballrooms at the Marriott Marquis and the Hyatt Regency. In a sense, some say, Paschal's is an unintended victim of the movement's success.
"They fed the civil rights movement," said Michael L. Lomax, a former chairman of the Fulton County Commission. "They fed the sit-in movement. They fed the emerging political movement. And they fed themselves right out of business."
Officials at Clark Atlanta University, a predominantly black college, hope that their purchase of Paschal's and $1 million in planned renovations will help revitalize their largely rundown neighborhood.
During the days of Jim Crow, Hunter Street was a hub of black commerce. As the city's first black-owned hotel, now with 120 rooms, Paschal's was a source of pride, as were the street's other restaurants, drug stores and professional offices, said Ben Brown, a civil rights veteran who first suggested the sale of the complex to the university. Now the street, which has been renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, is rundown, with little to commend it besides Paschal's, a few beauty shops and a funeral home.
The Paschal brothers do not plan to retire. James Paschal, who has always managed the brothers' business affairs, will stay busy with their operations at Hartsfield International Airport, where the Paschals are part of a lucrative joint venture that leases retail space to restaurants and shops.
Recently, the Paschals opened a small restaurant at the airport with an abbreviated version of their famous menu. And Robert Paschal, who has been in poor health, said he planned to spend some time there, teaching the chefs "a certain little thing I do to the chicken."
"Just as soon as I'm feeling a little better, I'm sure enough going to go out to the airport and teach them how to cook that chicken," he said. "They don't know quite how to do it."

HEADLINE: Senate G.O.P. Seeks Tax Cuts In Stalled Talks On State Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 14

 BODY:
In the surest sign yet that slow-moving talks over the New York State budget are finally turning serious, the Republican leadership of the State Senate plans to unveil an ambitious proposal this week to cut an array of business taxes by $75 million this year and much more in future years.
Though the Republicans say the plan would take a relatively small bite out of the $63 billion 1996-97 state budget now under negotiation, it would have a significant effect on future spending plans because it would grow in value to almost $1 billion by fiscal year 2000. 
 Critics say it is irresponsible for the Senate Republicans to propose new tax cuts in a year in which the Governor and legislative leaders are already considering deep spending cuts in education, health care and welfare programs to close a projected $4 billion budget shortfall.
But Senate leaders said they believed that enough money was available to soften some spending cuts in Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget while also cutting new taxes. They also asserted that additional tax cuts would promote job growth and lead to higher tax revenues in the long run.
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, said in an interview that cuts in personal and corporate taxes over the last two years had spurred the state's economy. "If you are doing something right, why not continue it?" he said.
But the Senate proposal is also a political manifesto for this fall's campaigns, in which all 211 seats in the Legislature will be up for election. The Senate Republicans have traditionally run on a tax-cutting platform, and having Mr. Bruno bring a tax-reduction package to the budget table would allow Republican candidates to say they had pushed for tax cuts this year, whether they win them or not.
Mr. Pataki has said in the past that he supports aspects of the Senate plan, but he has also raised questions about whether this is the right year to do it, given the state's fiscal problems. "We'll look at it," his spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said of Mr. Bruno's plan.
Major elements of the Senate plan are likely to face significant opposition in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, where many members wanted to delay a personal income tax cut that took effect on April 1 as a way to avoid spending reductions. Those Democrats are sure to oppose several of the Senate's new tax cuts, particularly one intended to help the real-estate industry.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, did not return telephone calls seeking reaction to the Senate proposal.
The budget for the 1996-97 fiscal year that began on April 1 is now two weeks late, making this the 12th consecutive year that the Legislature has failed to enact a spending plan on time. Until now, the budget talks have been proceeding at an unusually slow pace while legislative leaders have waited for Congress to pass a Federal budget.
But the state is operating on a 30-day spending plan that runs out on April 30. For that reason, the Legislature is under pressure to enact a budget in the coming weeks to avoid disruptions in state payments to public employees, community groups, local governments and school districts.
The Senate proposal calls for cutting or eliminating about a dozen business taxes over the coming four years. The plan also would restore some of Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts in education and health care programs.
Mr. Bruno said his top priority would be to eliminate in the coming year a 10 percent gains tax on real estate transfers worth more than $1 million -- derisively named by Republicans the "Cuomo tax" for the former Governor who signed it into law in 1983. New York is the only state to have such a gains tax, which last year generated $106 million for the state.
Mr. Bruno said that the tax had stifled the real estate market, prevented renovations on aging buildings and discouraged out-of-state financiers from investing in the city. Citing a study prepared for the Real Estate Board of New York and the Rent Stabilization Association of New York, the city's two major landlords, organizations, Mr. Bruno said elimination of the tax would trigger $7.7 billion in real estate transfers and create 6,900 new jobs, mostly for renovation work.
The study contends that the spurt in real-estate sales would provide $215 million to the city and $62 million to the state in revenue from other taxes on property transfers. Mr. Bruno suggested that that windfall could be calculated as part of the state's overall aid package to the Giuliani administration this year.
First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said that Giuliani administration officials would probably support repeal of the tax because they believed it deterred real estate transfers. Rescinding the tax, he said, "may create more money than it taxes away."
The real estate industry has been a major campaign contributor in the last year, particularly to Republicans. In 1995, the Real Estate Board, the Rent Stabilization Association and the Realtors Political Action Committee gave a total of $8,000 to Mr. Bruno, $106,000 to the Republican Senate Campaign Committee, $62,500 to the State Republican Committee and $6,750 to Mr. Pataki. In the same period, the three groups gave $2,400 to Mr. Silver and $13,600 to the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee.
Mr. Bruno denied that campaign contributions played a role in his decision to push for eliminating the real estate gains tax. "We receive money from every walk of life," he said. "Does that mean that you can't legislate because you'll be in conflict?"
Mr. Bruno's plan will also call for the gradual elimination of the gross receipts tax on energy and telecommunications companies, which is passed through to customers in utility bills. Democrats and Republicans agree that lower-income people pay a disproportionately high percentage of the tax.
And the plan will call for reducing estate taxes and taxes paid by farmers and beer and soda bottlers and on diesel fuel.
Critics said eliminating the real estate gains tax would benefit only the wealthy and do little to fuel economic growth. "This is a very specific tax cut aimed at a few people," said Robert Lynch, an associate professor of economics at the State University of New York at Cortland, who has studied state tax issues. "Why it would promote economic activity is beyond me."

The Homeless Leave a Tunnel
The sagging shanties that lined the cavernous two-and-a-half mile Amtrak tunnel hard by the Hudson River may be the oldest remaining homeless community in New York City. But now, some of the people who live in the tunnel have been encouraged to apply for Federal housing vouchers and try living above ground. [B1.]
 
With Spring, a Columbia Strike
It's April. The trees in Central Park sprout buds. Baseball is back. And students at Columbia University occupy a building. While not precisely an annual rite, demonstrations at Columbia are certainly a hardy perennial, passed immutably from one generation to the next. But today's protesting students sometimes find the inevitable comparisons with earlier upheavals more burden than inspiration. [B1.]
 
Business Tax Cuts Proposed

Critics say it is irresponsible for the Republicans to propose new tax cuts in a year in which deep spending cuts are being considered. [B1.]
 
Lifting a Veil of Secrecy
Two months ago, after the beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, the State Legislature approved a measure to lift the secrecy that had shrouded child abuse cases. Last week, with the release of city and state reports about Elisa's death, came the most tangible indication of what the law will -- and will not -- mean to the public's knowledge of abuse cases. The two reports were blunt, but both stopped short of naming even one of the many cited for incompetence. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B1.]

Ten years ago, in a novel plan to lower construction costs and damage the Mafia, the city began subsidizing a private concrete company in Manhattan. But the plan dissolved after the company collapsed in bankruptcy. Now the Giuliani administration is reviving the idea. It has begun advertising for a new company to open a plant on city-owned property and become the sole concrete supplier for all municipal construction projects in Manhattan. [B5.]

Two days before he announced his retirement from the State Senate in 1995, Ralph J.

Ms. Kasinga's two-year ordeal will reach a critical juncture when the Board of Immigration Appeals considers her asylum request. The case could influence the handling of a broad array of claims from women who have suffered because of discriminatory cultural practices at home. [A1.]

HEADLINE: In Developing Nations, Buzzwords Fall Flat

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bill McKibben (Op-Ed, April 10) rightly argues that in the Western industrial context, the term "sustainable development" will be biased toward growth. Given the dominance of industrial ideology in the United States, coupled with our consumer life style, it is no surprise that "development" has already displaced "sustainability" as the operative term in this formulation. 
 Mr. McKibben proposes that we replace sustainable development with "maturity," which he believes emphasizes restraint.
While restraint is indeed what we need to be thinking about, forgotten is the fact that the concept of sustainable development was initially invented to establish a global environmental dialogue between the developed and developing worlds. In the developing world, a discourse about "maturity" has simply proved to be a nonstarter.
Faced with exploding populations and high levels of poverty, the idea of giving up growth for moral and spiritual development is a hopeless cause. In this context the only strategy is to find a new model that sets a course for an environmentally "sustainable growth."
But the fact that we in the developed world are failing to do anything more than pay lip service to this concept is surely at the root of the forthcoming ecological crisis. On this point Mr. McKibben couldn't be more on target.

HEADLINE: As Clinton Visits Changing Asia, Military Concerns Gain Urgency

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
After his last trip to Japan three years ago, one dominated by vicious disputes over trade, President Clinton returns on Tuesday to a changed strategic landscape, with Japan seeming a reduced economic threat, and China seeming a larger military one.
With Beijing struggling to gain respect as a great power through displays of military prowess off Taiwan, and North Korea declaring the 1953 armistice between the Koreas dead, Asia appears more fragile, raising new questions about the American commitment to use its power to enforce the stability required for growth and trade. 
 So President Clinton's now extended drop-by visit to South Korea and then two full days in Japan are intended to highlight security reassurances rather than trade squabbles, to try to convince the region that America will remain Asia's closest ally and the most efficient restraint on China's ambitions and North Korea's desperation.
Mr. Clinton's new emphasis is an acknowledgment that diplomacy is something larger than trade, and that even in the post-Soviet world America's interests require demonstrations of military strength and political will.
As such, Mr. Clinton's trip to South Korea, Japan and Russia is another step in his revised self-definition of his presidency. These days Mr. Clinton presents himself not only as pastor to the nation, consoling it in times of grief, but also as the kind of reliable foreign-policy steward that centrist Republicans like his presidential rival, Senator Bob Dole, have traditionally represented.
In all three countries he visits, old assumptions are being questioned, and Mr. Clinton's task will be to bring reassurance, even if his own larger diplomatic goals are vague.
In the Koreas, the North is demanding a new relationship with the United States to end 43 years of stalemate even as it appears to be crumbling and dangerous. In Russia, the whole thrust of American policy is at stake in June's elections. Mr. Clinton, with other leaders like Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, will try to help an ill, weakened and more nationalist-sounding Boris N. Yeltsin beat back the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov. They will try to convince Russians alienated by Mr. Yeltsin's intermittent reforms that a modern, democratic Russia welcomed by the world is better than the aggressive nostalgia offered by Mr. Zyuganov.
The ground is shifting in Japan, too, with increasingly pointed questions about how much longer 47,000 American troops and their families must be based there, and how much say Tokyo will ever have in American strategy.
These questions were articulated forcefully in a speech here last month by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. "One cannot expect the Japanese public to merely accept the current reality of expansion of military activities of U.S. forces stationed in Japan from the Far East to the Middle East without any discussions," he said. And then asked, "Why is it necessary to maintain a level of 47,000 U.S. military troops in Japan?"
Even on trade issues, the contrasts are clear from three years ago, when Mr. Clinton began his trip by embracing a new generation of politicians trying to overthrow the Liberal Democratic Party. But within a year, two rebels Mr. Clinton met then -- Mr. Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata -- took successive, failed turns as Prime Minister. The Liberal Democrats are back in power with Ryutaro Hashimoto, who fought off many of the changes Washington demanded. "We misjudged the ability of the 'reformers' to deliver," a senior advis conceded.
Mr. Clinton and his new Commerce Secretary, Mickey Kantor, argue that the pressure resulted in more than 20 trade accords and sharply increased American imports in targeted areas.
But Mr. Clinton also benefited from other economic changes. The strong yen makes American goods attractive. Japanese companies have moved production to Southeast Asia and China at an astounding rate -- so that many Japanese imports to America are listed as trade with Malaysia or Thailand. Japan's carmakers have shifted more and more production to America.
While trade issues will not disappear, suddenly the world does not seem entirely safe for the marketplace. And there is increasing criticism of America's Asia policy as ad hoc and reactive. Gregory Treverton of the Rand Corporation research organization criticized Mr. Clinton for having "subcontracted" Japan policy for too long to Mr. Kantor, neglecting a comprehensive strategic dialogue.
It was the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by American servicemen last September that was the catalyst for the new concentration on security dialogue, United States officials say. The sharp protests about the presence of American troops so long after World War II shook the Pentagon.
Rapid moves to set up a special Japanese-American dialogue over Okinawa resulted in the announcement last Friday -- accelerated for political benefit by Mr. Hashimoto -- that the United States would return a major airbase on Okinawa within seven years and relocate some troops to mainland Japan.
[In an effort to smooth the way for Mr. Clinton's trip, the American Government signed the agreement in Tokyo on Monday. The return of several important military sites on Okinawa, which would take place during the next seven years or so, would reduce by 20 percent the land taken up by American bases there.
[Japanese hostility to the bases has been greatest on Okinawa, and the new agreement reflects an extraordinary effort to meet the objections of the Okinawans and reduce the antagonisms. The United States will return Futenma Air Station, as announced on Friday, as well as the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, the Sobe communications center, the Gimbaru Training Area and a major part of the Northern Training Area.
[Defense Secretary William Perry and Ambassador Walter F. Mondale, who represented the United States at the signing, both said the return of the land would not undermine American military preparedness in Asia.
While hailed in Japan, the agreement was an ambivalent message at best. Other countries in the region who are nervous about North Korean instability and Chinese military ambitions could see the return of the base as a waning of the American security commitment.
There are similar concerns, in spades, about Mr. Clinton's China policy. The United States has serious questions about China's intentions on the spreading of nuclear arms, stance toward Taiwan, and missile sales to Iran and Pakistan. But those problems have become entangled with equally serious economic issues about trade, budget deficits and respect for intellectual property rights.
Mr. Clinton will try to be reassuring about the coherence of America's policy of pulling China, like Russia, into the web of alliances and obligations that are normal for major powers while admitting the seriousness of United States-Chinese problems, which could lead to sanctions.
Japanese business leaders make it clear that United States economic sanctions against China would be unilateral. "Given our history with China, I don't see how we could join in anything like that," said Ryuzaburo Kaku, the chairman of Canon Inc. "It's not even being discussed."


GRAPHIC: Clinton visits South Korea, Japan and Russia, arriving in South Korea tomorrow and leaving Russia on Sunday.
 
1. South Korea
Mr. Clinton intends to show support for Korea's economically powerful democracy and American resolve to help defend the country. The stopover was lengthened after new tensions broke out with North Korea.
 
2. Japan
Mr. Clinton will spend two days in Tokyo, after canceling a summit meeting last November. He will unveil a new joint security declaration with Japan, promising to keep 100,000 American troops in Asia through this century while working -- as in Okinawa -- to lessen the burden on host countries.
 
4. Russia
Mr. Clinton will demonstrate support for what the embattled Russian President, Boris Nr. Yeltsin, has largely represented: a modern, democracy that is a part of the world community and not the aggressive expansionist Russia represented by his chief rival in June's elections, a Communist.

HEADLINE: Foreign Aid Makes A Visible Difference

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Donors of Foreign Aid Have Second Thoughts" (Week in Review, April 7): 
 While some aid has "fattened elites," some has also helped to improve living standards in poor countries. According to the United Nations Development Program, life expectancy in the developing world is 17 years longer than in 1960. Infant mortality has been more than halved. Primary and secondary school enrollment is 1.5 times higher.
The article gives the impression that nongovernmental organizations have been financed by government aid, with those funds used for the agencies back home. Church World Service, which you cite, is not dependent upon United States Government funds. A small part of our budget comes from the Government and is used to help resettle 7,000 refugees in the United States every year.
One reason Western governments have turned to partnerships with nongovernmental organizations is that they are seen to be best placed to facilitate the bottom-up development that is the key to reducing poverty.

HEADLINE: New York Needs a State Smoking Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Leave the Smoking Ban Alone" (editorial, April 11): 
 You suggest that uniform smoking regulations for all of New York state make sense "only if restaurants acquire wheels and begin serving dinners from town to town."
Restaurant patrons do have wheels, and many of them, especially in the outer boroughs of New York City, are simply driving across the city line where they can dine and smoke.
A study just completed for us by Dun & Bradstreet shows that restaurant jobs declined in New York City while rising in surrounding counties, and while retail jobs and other economic indicators were going up in the metropolitan area. The smoking ban is the only logical explanation for city restaurant employment's going against the trend.
A patchwork of local smoking regulations is unfair to restaurant owners and confusing both to them and their patrons. The statewide legislation, in addition to creating a level playing field for restaurateurs, permits a practical way to address the sensitivities of nonsmoking diners, one that has been effective for many years: separate smoking and nonsmoking sections, with diners choosing where to sit.
Smoking is a legal, ingrained custom to many New York City residents and tourists, especially foreign visitors. It is unjust to punish them and hurt the livelihoods of restaurant owners to appease antismoking interest groups. We need a reasonable statewide law that permits restaurants to respond to the demands of customers.

HEADLINE: Hospitals Sue New Jersey to Recover Millions Spent to Treat the Poor

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 15

 BODY:
The New Jersey Hospital Association, a trade organization that represents most of the state's hospitals, filed a lawsuit against the state today, seeking payment for free medical treatment to the uninsured.
New Jersey was supposed to have sent out its third round of checks today to reimburse 84 hospitals around the state for providing the free medical care. The state distributed $388 million to hospitals last year by dipping into the unemployment insurance fund, but the state's authority to continue using the fund expired on Dec. 31. Attempts to come up with a new financing plan, including the raising of the cigarette tax, have failed to gain legislative approval. 
 In its lawsuit, filed in State Superior Court in Essex County, the hospital association argued that the state had been improperly using private institutions to provide medical treatment without "just compensation."
The lawsuit seeks full reimbursement for all charity care services provided, estimated to be $600 million this year. State officials have proposed providing less than $300 million this year.
The lawsuit is the latest effort by hospital administrators to put pressure on Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and the New Jersey State Legislature to come up with a new plan.
"New Jersey hospitals have gone four months without charity care reimbursement," said Gary S. Carter, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association. "Governor Whitman and the Legislature have failed to resolve the charity care issue, with no concrete proposal to date regarding a viable funding source. We cannot in good faith wait any longer for a solution from the state."
Mr. Carter said that hospitals would continue to provide medical treatment without regard to a patient's ability to pay. But Mr. Carter said that it had become increasingly difficult for many hospitals to continue caring for the uninsured without any state reimbursement. So far this year, the state payments would have totaled $99 million.
Without the reimbursements, some hospitals, particularly in the state's urban areas, have slowed payments to suppliers. Several hospital administrators have threatened to close wards and outpatient clinics and lay off staff members next month if the state does not resume payments soon.
Governor Whitman met with Republican and Democratic leaders last week to discuss charity care, but no agreement on a new plan was reached. Both organized labor and businesses have objected to the state's continuing dependence on its unemployment insurance fund to pay for most of the charity care program. Almost $1.6 billion has been taken out of the fund to pay for charity care since 1993.
"I understand the hospitals' frustration," Governor Whitman said today. "We are all frustrated. We are narrowing down our differences, and I believe that we will come up with a solution in the not so distant future."
In the State Legislature, both the Assembly Speaker, Jack Collins, and the Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said that they were moving toward a solution and hoped that legislation would be ready for a vote when the Legislature returns in May.
"The legislators sympathize with the hospitals," said Rae Hutton, a spokeswoman for Mr. DiFrancesco. "They are making every effort to resolve the matter. There is recognition that the hospitals need to be compensated. It is just a matter of how."

HEADLINE: Rivals Bicker In Monrovia As Cease-Fire Holds, Barely

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, April 15

 BODY:
Liberian leaders tried to shore up a tenuous truce today even as sporadic sniper fire rang out in Monrovia and young thugs raced through the streets brandishing assault rifles.
With only an estimated 50 Americans remaining in Monrovia, American troops ended their full-scale evacuation effort on Sunday. About 500 Americans and more than 1,100 other foreigners were lifted to safety since violence convulsed the capital nine days ago. 
 Looters and militia members with grenades and machetes rode through the streets in stolen vehicles today, but they no longer appeared to be menacing civilians now that most shops have already been ransacked.
One militia leader, Charles Taylor, agreed to stop shelling a former military barracks in Monrovia, the Barclay Training Center, where his rival, Roosevelt Johnson, has been holding hundreds of hostages for more than a week.
But Mr. Taylor refused to negotiate with Mr. Johnson over the release of the captives, including 22 West African peacekeepers and some 50 Lebanese civilians.
"As a Government, we are not going to negotiate with these terrorists," Mr. Taylor, who is also a member of Liberia's ruling council, told reporters at his residence in the former Moroccan Embassy in a Monrovia suburb.
West African peacekeeping troops had been sent to the barracks today, Mr. Taylor said, and he urged Mr. Johnson to turn himself in to the United States Embassy or the United Nations.
Mr. Taylor, who touched off the country's civil war with a coup attempt in 1989, has agreed to maintain the cease-fire only if Mr. Johnson surrenders. It was an attempt to capture Mr. Johnson, who is wanted on murder charges, that had sparked the latest round of fighting here on April 6.
The battles since then have left some 60,000 residents of the capital homeless and hungry. No one knows how many people have been killed, but dozens of decaying bodies have been seen littering the streets.
Most of the shops and office buildings in the Liberian capital have been looted and many destroyed since the fighting began.
Liberia, founded by freed American slaves in 1822, had fought a nearly seven-year civil war until all sides accepted a peace accord last year. The war killed more than 150,000 people and ruined much of the economy. When lingering tension between rival groups moved to the capital from the countryside and erupted nine days ago, the peace quickly collapsed.
The United States Ambassador, William Milan, said that while the full-scale evacuations of foreigners had ended on Sunday, United States troops would continue to airlift people out when necessary.
Mr. Taylor's spokesman, Reginald Goodridge, criticized the evacuation operation today. "We do not think that the crisis is deep enough to warrant the airlift of people," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar at Recent High vs. Mark On Comment by German Banker

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to a 14-month high against the mark yesterday after the president of the German central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, said he would welcome a further decline in the exchange value of his nation's currency.
The dollar also rose against the Swiss franc and other European currencies, and was little changed against the Japanese yen. 
 Mr. Tietmeyer's comments, made on Saturday at a European Union conference in Verona, Italy, added impetus to a rally that has lifted the dollar 2.7 percent against the mark in the last month. He said a further decline in the mark would help bolster Germany's sputtering economy.
"When you hear Tietmeyer talk like that, it gives confidence for the market to buy dollars," said Don Quattrucci, a currency trader at the Boston Company, a money-management firm.
The dollar's recent gains against the mark have been spurred by the view that the American economy is strong enough to keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates, at a time when many analysts think that rates in Europe are headed lower. Higher rates make deposits in a particular currency more attractive.
The dollar rose as high as 1.5136 marks yesterday, before settling in New York trading at 1.5127 marks, up from 1.5035 marks on Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was unchanged at 108.55.
The Swiss franc fell to a eight-month low against the dollar. Like Germany, Switzerland is grappling with sluggish growth and rising unemployment. The dollar rose as high as 1.2356 Swiss francs, before settling in New York at 1.2347 francs, up from 1.2260 on Friday.
The mark's weakness contributed to the dollar's dip against the yen. When traders want to sell marks and other European currencies for yen, they often do so by first converting their marks to dollars, the most liquid currency. They then sell the dollars for yen -- which gives the yen an indirect boost against the dollar.
Mr. Tietmeyer's comments also spurred speculation that the German central bank, the Bundesbank, would lower interest rates at its policy meeting on Thursday. "We're going to see a rate cut on Thursday," said Gary Sakamoto, a vice president at National Australia Bank. "We're going to see a considerable weakening of the mark."
But other analysts argued that the Germans would leave rates alone for now. "I think the market is 50-50 on this," said Belal Khan, head of corporate currency sales at the Royal Bank of Canada.

HEADLINE: A New Japan Policy?

BYLINE: By Richard N. Haass; Richard N. Haass directs the national security program at the Council on Foreign Relations.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton arrives in Tokyo today on a mission to repair the United States' strained relations with Japan. Fortunately, the Administration has indicated he will jettison his longstanding trade-first focus and concentrate for now on the strategic relationship between the countries.
But this belated effort to reinvigorate our most important Asian alliance will be for naught unless both countries agree on specific steps to restore stability to the region, and the Administration shifts away from its trade-centered policy permanently. 
 President Clinton and his advisers -- especially Mickey Kantor, who served as United States Trade Representative until being named Commerce Secretary last week -- have largely ignored the political and military dimensions of the relationship and have focused almost exclusively on America's trade deficit. In this, the Clinton Administration is hardly unique. The Bush Administration also stumbled badly in an awkward attempt to force Japan to open its markets. But the situation has grown more tense, and at the worst possible time.
North Korea is on the verge of economic collapse, and three times this month its soldiers have entered the demilitarized zone separating it from South Korea. This may or may not be part of a larger plan, but we cannot rule out a suicidal attempt to force reunification. President Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto should agree on a plan to deliver food and humanitarian aid to North Korea, but also publicly state that any attack would mark the North's demise.
China's economic boom is a major concern, as economic power tends to translate into political and military power. Only America and Japan, working together, could contain a belligerent China. This week, they should work out a plan for sanctions and Japanese support of possible American military action if China uses military force against Taiwan.
President Clinton must also help Japan become more active in world affairs. This means encouraging Tokyo to expand its Self-Defense Force to take on a more meaningful role in United Nations peacekeeping operations. In return, he might pledge to help Japan eventually get a seat on the United Nations Security Council.
And Mr. Clinton should press Japan to help isolate Iran's rogue Government, by refusing to reschedule overdue loans and refusing to provide further credits to the country's electrical industry.
It is vital that the United States not slip back into its trade-first ways when the current crises pass. An Administration that treats Japan like an adversary sends a powerful signal that our most important alliance in Asia has ended. Such an attitude is bad for trade. It feeds protectionist sentiment here and in Japan and ignores the fact that American exports to Japan have increased by 35 percent over the last three years.
Over time, a Japan alienated from the United States would become more assertive and independent in its foreign policy and economic expansionism. It would also be less likely to support American-sponsored regional efforts.
The United States would be smarter to take our trade concerns to the World Trade Organization, where we would gain the support of European and Asian nations that are also frustrated by Japan's protectionism. It is easier for Japan to make face-saving concessions in a global forum than to appear "defeated" in bilateral talks. When it comes time to talk trade in Tokyo, Mr. Clinton should enlist Mr. Hashimoto in working toward giving the W.T.O. broader jurisdiction over claims of unfairly restricted competition.
The cold war may be over, but political and military concerns are not obsolete. American foreign policy in Asia must be more than trade policy. Indeed, trade always suffers during instability and conflict.

HEADLINE: Big Steelmakers Shape Up;
U.S. Mills Win Back Business at Home and Abroad

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: SPARROWS POINT, Md.

 BODY:
Richard Moore was laid off from the Bethlehem Steel Corporation's sprawling mill here in 1981, one of tens of thousands of workers shed by the American steel industry as it fought to cut bloated costs and fend off surging imports.
Now, after a nearly 15-year stint selling auto parts, Mr. Moore is back on the job, one of 400 production workers hired here last year, the first new arrivals since 1979. More are expected to be hired soon. 
 "The work here is dirtier, hotter, more dangerous and strenuous" than the sales job, Mr. Moore said during a brief break. But, at $24 an hour in base pay and benefits, it is also "much better than what I was doing," he added.
The return of Mr. Moore and his colleagues -- and others like them at steel plants around the country -- marks the return as well of an industry that was nearly given up for dead in the United States a decade or so ago.
Slimmer now and better run, American steelmakers are taking back more and more pieces of their domestic business from competitors in Japan and other countries. And at levels not seen for half a century, they are going abroad with a vengeance, more than holding their own on foreign turf in terms of quality and price, even with the added expense of shipping.
Last year, they shipped 7.1 million tons of steel slabs, sheets and structural beams to foreign countries, nearly doubling the 3.8 million tons exported in 1994. It was the best export performance since 1940, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, the principal industry trade group. And orders are booming this year.
As explanation of why he expects to stay on this time around, Mr. Moore pointed to the fact that the tin-plating line he works on had sold its full 1996 production capacity by mid-March. Last year, Bethlehem exported 500,000 tons of steel from the plant here, along the Chesapeake Bay about 12 miles southeast of Baltimore. That is up from just 50,000 tons the year before. All in all, the performance last year and the strong orders so far this year "confirm that the U.S. steel industry has become competitive on a world basis," said Peter F. Marcus, a metals analyst at Paine Webber.
To be sure, the United States still imports more steel than it exports, at least partly because so many outmoded mills have been closed that the domestic industry cannot fully supply the market. Imports totaled 24.4 million tons last year. And the bulk of the hiring here and at other plants is to replace retiring workers, not to add to the payroll.
Still, in one basic category, hot rolled sheet steel, the United States has been a net exporter since last June. And overall employment in the industry -- now thought to be around 170,000 -- has begun to increase as the first few of nearly a dozen new mills scheduled to open by the end of the decade have started production. Taken together, the numbers show just how far American steelmakers have come in changing their old ways, analysts and industry executives say.
Those ways were marked by a full plate of inefficiencies: overstaffing, outmoded production processes and poor quality control. Foreign steelmakers, led by the Japanese and the Europeans, saw their chance and moved in. But there were domestic threats to the steel giants as well, from so-called mini-mills, upstart operators that turned out low-cost steel from scrap rather than from raw materials. And some foreign companies bought plants in the United States and began to revamp them.
Eventually, the big American steelmakers got serious about survival. They slashed payrolls, shuttered the most antiquated of their hulking mills and spent billions on new technology and equipment.
With costs down and quality up, the industry has been positioned of late to take advantage of currency swings that have made American products cheaper abroad. Besides making American steel itself more attractive to foreign markets, the relative weakness of the dollar has helped many domestically made products, from cars to appliances, that contain steel. And that, in turn, has given the American steelmakers a chance to retake at least some of their home ground.
Noting that the Chrysler Corporation is exporting steel to Europe to make Jeeps there and that cars containing American steel are being exported in larger numbers than they used to be, Michelle Applebaum, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, said: "The Rust Bowl in the United States has become competitive again. The steel market is the primary beneficiary of the new competitive heartland in the United States and is stronger than it has been in decades."
The evidence of the shift is striking in sheet steel, the biggest category and a major component of cars, building materials and appliances. At the beginning of 1995, Ms. Applebaum said, imports accounted for a net market share (subtracting exports) of 17 percent. But by the end of the year that figure was down to 5 percent. "That means that a full 12 percent share was given back to the U.S. market," she said, equaling twice the output of one large steelmaker, Inland Steel Industries.
One measure of efficiency is the amount of labor it takes to produce a given quantity of steel. According to Mr. Marcus, the average integrated mill in the United States requires 4.42 hours of labor to produce a metric ton, or 2,200 pounds, of steel. That compares with 4.49 hours in Japan, 4.69 in Germany and 4.71 in Britain. Twenty years ago, when far more labor was required, Japan was the leader, at 11.36 hours, followed by the United States, at 12.49.
Steel executives say exports provide a long-term opportunity, though shipments are likely to vary from year to year, depending on domestic demand. Because it costs about $50 a ton to ship steel overseas, the profit margin is less than in a domestic sale. But because blast furnaces must be run continuously, disgorging ton after ton of molten pig iron, manufacturers like having an alternative market if demand falls at home.
"Right now, the domestic market is more attractive, so our exports will probably be less this year than in 1995," said Paul Wilhelm, president of the U.S. Steel Group of the USX Corporation. U.S. Steel exported 1.5 million of the 11.4 million tons of steel it made last year. But the company is a permanent player in the export business, with long-term overseas accounts, Mr. Wilhelm said.
John J. Connelly, the president of U.S. Steel International Inc., added, "We see this as an ongoing 4 to 5 percent of our business through thick and thin."
And while the cheap dollar helps keep that market open, industry experts say, there are other factors.
"Currency has an effect, but in the end if you are low-cost, high-quality and meet customer expectations, you will get business," said Curtis H. Barnette, Bethlehem Steel's chairman.
This newfound efficiency and quality will have increasing importance in coming years as the new mills begin opening in this country. If products from the new mills can push out imports rather than cannibalize older mills, as has been the case in the past, jobs at places like Sparrows Point look like a better long-term bet.
All the start-ups are patterned on mini-mills, which have small, highly efficient work forces. The Nucor Corporation, the mini-mill leader, can make steel at some of its mills with less than half an hour of labor a ton.
But the mini-mills may no longer enjoy the big advantage over traditional mills that they had in the past, some experts say. In part, that is because the traditional mills have become so much more efficient.
Another reason has to do with the production process of most mini-mills: They have to live with the impurities in the recycled materials they use, and the price of high-quality scrap has been rising. Integrated mills, because they work from raw materials, can better tune the chemistry of their products.
Because the price of scrap is likely to keep rising as new mini-mills add to demand, many companies are investing in ways to separate iron from ore that do not involve blast furnaces, which are costly to build and operate. Nucor, for example, is converting ore into iron carbide, a form of the metal that can be added to scrap.
As the mini-mills lose some of their edge, the slimmed-down integrated mills should be able to hold their own better on the domestic front, analysts predict.
At Sparrows Point, the changes have been profound. In the 1950's and 60's, it was more like an independent empire than a factory. The mill employed about 30,000 people and there was a company town, complete with company-owned housing, stores and schools. There was even a police force and a semi-professional football team.
In the late 60's, the company decided to end this paternalistic system and to gradually close down the town. New mill buildings swallowed the remains of the town, and the workers who stayed on the payroll moved to Baltimore and the surrounding area.
"There was a high school where the blast furnace is now," said Duane Dunham, the president of Bethlehem's Sparrows Point division.
Over the last decade, Bethlehem poured in $1.6 billion for improvements. Everything in the mill is automated and run by computer, allowing only a few people to control the movement of vast amounts of material by watching wall-sized displays. Today the plant employs just 3,250 people and can make 3.5 million tons of steel a year, about one-third of its capacity in the old days.
The attitude of the employees and their union, the United Steelworkers of America, has changed as well. At the tin plate plant to which Mr. Moore is assigned, for instance, the rigid union work rules of the past have become flexible.
"We are all cross-trained, so we can fill in for people who are not here," said Brenda Matthews, one of the new workers, adding that little distinction was made between men and women. "Women do the same jobs as men," she said, with one exception: Only the men load the heavy bars of tin needed in the electroplating process.
Even some of the veterans are whistling a new tune. James Henson has been at Sparrows Point for 25 years, mostly as an operator of a tractor that moves coils of sheet steel prior to shipment.
"In the old days, we had people chasing coils all over the place," he said, waving at a warehouse that is easily as long as three football fields. "Now it is all on computer and we are shipping to our customers on a just-in-time basis. Every tractor operator has a computer and every coil is logged in. It's better this way."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Gain On Treasuries For 3d Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were higher yesterday despite a lack of new economic data.
While bonds have now posted gains in three consecutive sessions, traders and analysts say the market has not shifted from its bearish tone. 
 Some investors were expecting a continuation of Friday's strong rally. But many stayed on the sidelines yesterday and trading was light, typical for a Monday.
Traders said market participants needed to see more evidence that the economy was expanding at a pace fast enough to prompt the Federal Reserve into raising short-term interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating. The market remains unsure what course the Fed will take.
After Friday's sharp gains, trading yesterday was largely in a crossfire between investors selling to take profits and short-sellers, who had bet on prices falling, buying to limit their losses.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond settled up 7/32, to 90 2/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.78 percent, from 6.79 percent on Friday.
At the Treasury's regular weekly bill auction yesterday, rates were lower as investor interest picked up because the offering was smaller, totaling $21 billion, down from $27 billion last week.
The three-month rate averaged 4.87 percent, compared with 5.03 percent a week ago, while the six-month bill rate averaged 5.03 percent, down from 5.19 percent.
Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said it was hard to say what moved the market yesterday. He noted that the market was so concerned with inflation that an announcement that Post Cereals would cut prices was cheered.
"The action may have been interpreted by the market as a sign that the recent rise in commodity prices may not filter through as inflation," he said.
A decline in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities also helped ease concerns about inflation, he said. The index fell 0.89 point, to 259.26.
In any case, Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International in San Francisco, said that "the market has probably overacted to the rise in commodities prices over the short term."
Greg Jones, also an economist with MMS International, said the market was behaving in April much as it did in March, appearing hopeless one day and then invincible the next. But this month, he said, the market has been able to recoup most of its losses after a stronger-than-expected employment report.
In the futures market, the June bond contract closed at its high price of 110 11/32.
"Now it looks like a consolidation pattern for the next few weeks is setting up," said Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research. "And the door is open for the bond price to rise to 111 6/32."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury bill auction of new three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The WPP Group cautiously re-enters the acquisition arena.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE world's largest agency company, the WPP Group, is cautiously putting expansion back on its agenda -- including additional investments in new media ventures in the United States -- after returning from the brink of extinction.
"Given where our business is concentrated, it makes sense to grow through acquisition," Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP of London, said. He spoke last week in a wide-ranging, 75-minute interview during a visit to New York. 
 For instance, Mr. Sorrell said, WPP, which bought 5 percent of the Hotwired on-line service from Wired Ventures, plans to make a similar investment "in the next couple weeks," with the goal of having "investments of a couple million dollars in four or five situations."
Although "our objective is not to go into the venture capital business," he added, "if agencies behave like dinosaurs, they will become like dinosaurs." He said, "We need to explore how advertising content can be developed in the new media."
WPP billings rose 15.2 percent last year to $22.7 billion, from $19.7 billion in 1994, according to the trade publication Advertising Age. WPP holdings include the global agency networks Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and the J. Walter Thompson Company as well as a smaller network, Conquest Europe, and shops that specialize in corporate identity consulting, direct marketing and health care advertising.
Mr. Sorrell said WPP was interested in acquiring an Asian-Pacific market research company, as part of efforts to "focus on the faster-growing parts of the world."
And, he added, the thought of buying a small, creatively focused agency -- one of the so-called hot shops so eagerly sought by cutting-edge clients -- was "a fairly seductive idea" that WPP executives were "actively thinking about."
Still, Mr. Sorrell, 51, who was burned earlier this decade, was discouraging any suggestions that WPP might embark on a buying spree. Debts taken on during an acquisition binge that began after Mr. Sorrell took control of WPP in 1986, which were aggravated by the worldwide advertising recession, forced WPP to within an eyelash of going under.
"Obviously, we've come through a difficult time," Mr. Sorrell said. "The point is: It has to be carefully done, carefully thought through."
Mr. Sorrell said he preferred "organic growth," such as a media-buying unit that WPP "is probably going to go ahead" and form by combining the separate media buying operations of Ogilvy and Thompson.
"Agencies have to work with the new media conglomerates like Disney and ABC and Turner and Time Warner to come up with greater solutions for clients to make brands famous," he added.
Analysts who follow the agency industry said Mr. Sorrell's low-key approach was the best -- and perhaps only -- course for WPP.
"There's no doubt they're out of the woods," said Lorna Tilbian at Panmure Gordon in London. She said that "impressive targets have actually been achieved" in profit margins, which climbed from 6 percent in 1992 to 9 percent in 1995 and a projected 10 percent this year -- on the way to 12 percent in 1998.
"But I don't think there are major acquisitions to be made," Ms. Tilbian said, adding that WPP would benefit far more from concentrating on "controlling costs as revenues rise, as the majority of that falls to the bottom line."
Alan J. Gottesman, managing director at West End Communications/Consulting in New York, said: "In recent years, if there was a critical problem at WPP, it wasn't on the advertising side, it was on the business side. And that seems to have gone away.
"But we're talking advertising here, not brain surgery," he added. "Very, very rarely does a major, major agency manage itself out of existence."
Mr. Gottesman said that "even if a deal made sense," WPP stock "would probably get clobbered" because investors would look askance at Mr. Sorrell and "give it a 'there he goes again' reaction."
Even so, he added, "is it in Mr. Sorrell's nature to show he's in the game? My guess is he's Sorrell-y tempted."
Mr. Sorrell said: "I will probably admit to never being happy, being a most discontented soul. The business is in pretty good shape, starting to fire on all cylinders. We're moving in the right direction. But we could always do better."
Mr. Sorrell said he judged WPP's performance against that of four other agency companies. Two are public: the Omnicom Group, No. 2 in the Advertising Age rankings with billings of $20.2 billion in 1995, and the Interpublic Group of Companies, No. 3 at $16.1 billion. Their profit margins last year ranged from 12 percent to 14 percent, compared with WPP's 9 percent to 10 percent.
The two private agency companies Mr. Sorrell uses as benchmarks -- Young & Rubicam Inc., No. 6 in 1995 at $9.9 billion, and the Leo Burnett Company, No. 10 at $5.4 billion -- do not release information about their profit margins.
This was the second time in a month that Mr. Sorrell, who had previously shied from reporters, gave an interview; the other was with Campaign, the British advertising trade publication.
"He's launched an aggressive campaign to communicate the company's turnaround story," Mr. Gottesman said.
There are already results: WPP stock, which traded recently around $26, closed at $30.50 yesterday in Nasdaq trading, near its 52-week high of $31.50.

HEADLINE: Wildcat Strike Shuts Down a G.M. Plant

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 15

 BODY:
A wildcat strike shut down a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, today that makes some of the General Motors Corporation's most popular cars, the latest sign of continued labor problems at the world's largest auto maker.
While there were several signs that the strike could prove brief, the work stoppage was another sign of the deep discontent on the floors of several large G.M. factories. That discontent could make it more difficult for the national leaders of the United Automobile Workers union to work out a compromise this summer with G.M.'s top management before the U.A.W.'s national contract with the Big Three auto makers expires on Sept. 14. 
 All 1,800 workers on the day shift at Lordstown walked off the job today at 9:30 A.M. to protest G.M.'s dismissal of the longtime chairman of the union's local bargaining committee, Al Alli. The reasons for Mr. Alli's dismissal were not entirely clear, with one version being that he did not clock in for duty properly. Only part of the evening shift reported for work tonight.
"Attendance is down, but we have enough people to run limited production," said Ray Deibel, a G.M. spokesman.
The union's national leadership did not authorize the strike and quickly urged the workers to return to work. Tony Zone, the president of the local in Lordstown, and Mr. Alli issued a statement also calling for an end to the walkout.
The Lordstown factory has a total of 5,500 hourly workers on three shifts, each of four 10-hour days, producing 6,500 to 7,000 cars a week.
Today's strike puts some pressure on G.M. because the Lordstown factory makes the Chevrolet Cavaliers and Pontiac Sunfires, which have been selling briskly even though G.M. offers few discounts on them.
"They are G.M.'s most successful cars," said Christopher W. Cedergren, an analyst at the Autopacific Group, a consulting and marketing company in Santa Ana, Calif. "That's a plant you don't want to be down for a long time."
But today's strike appears much less serious than the 17-day strike last month at G.M.'s two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, which crippled the company's North American operations for an after-tax loss that the company estimates at $900 million. The Lordstown factory does not produce parts for G.M.'s other North American assembly operations, Mr. Deibel said.
In addition to the Lordstown factory workers, employees at G.M. factories in Janesville, Wis.; Doraville, Ga., and Oklahoma City have been threatening walkouts this year. But the U.A.W.'s national leaders have been resisted authorizing further walkouts, as they review the hard-line stance taken during the Dayton strike by the auto maker, which challenged the striking workers' unemployment benefits.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Approves Shift Of State Jobs From Albany

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 15

 BODY:
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall today approved a scaled-down version of Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to move thousands of state-financed workers from heavily Democratic areas to Republican districts, ending a bitter political standoff with the Governor.
Mr. McCall has been drawing intense criticism from the Pataki administration because of his decision last month to block the Governor's original proposal to move nearly 5,000 state-financed jobs from the Democratic bastions of New York City and Albany to Republican areas upstate. 
 Democrats had accused the Pataki administration of making a blatant political payoff in trying to shift the jobs to Republican areas. In blocking the original plan, Mr. McCall said it had so many fiscal gimmicks that it violated state law, and that moving workers to vacant office buildings owned by I.B.M. in Kingston and Glendale required legislative approval because it would add to the state's debt.
But today, Mr. McCall announced that he had approved a revised plan that would move only about 3,300 workers from Albany to the Hudson Valley city of Kingston. His latest decision disappointed the Comptroller's fellow Democrats, as Mr. McCall singlehandedly had power to block the deal.
But Mr. McCall said he had little choice but to approve the new plan, which he said did not have many of the flaws in the original one. The original deal had required the state to enter into a lease-purchase agreement to own the I.B.M. buildings, and thus obligated it to take on debt without legislative approval.
The new deal, however, simply allows the Fleet Financial Group, which processes state tax forms, to move 3,650 of its state-financed workers into the vacant buildings in Kingston under a lease agreement it reached with I.B.M. Fleet has been urging the state to allow it to move the jobs because the office space in Kingston, about 60 miles to the south in Ulster County, is cheaper and more suited for an expansion it is considering.
"This is not a perfect deal," the Comptroller said. "I do not approve of economic development policies that shift jobs from one region of the state to another. Cutting a branch of a tree in Albany and sticking it in the ground in Kingston doesn't mean you've planted a forest. The acrimony between communities that has been generated by this proposal will be difficult to heal."
Mr. McCall also said the deal would cost the state more, though he could not provide an exact figure.
At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Pataki defended the deal, saying that it would save New York money and sent a message to businesses that the state would work to keep them. "It was clearly worth the fight," he said.
As Comptroller, Mr. McCall is required to review most new state contracts and changes in most existing ones. Mr. McCall's decision today involved amending the contract that the Fleet Financial Group already has with the state.
The Governor's original plan to transfer state jobs was proposed about a year ago as an effort to consolidate the state's data processing in the vacant I.B.M. buildings. The Pataki administration has estimated that the original plan would have saved $52 million a year -- a claim that Mr. McCall has viewed skeptically.
The job-transfer plan has been one of the administration's most controversial proposals, with cities and towns either attacking it or applauding it, depending on whether they gained or lost the jobs.
The original deal was even criticized by Mr. Pataki's most powerful ally in the Legislature, State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, whose district, the 43d in nearby Rensselaer County, includes many state employees who work in Albany.
Today's decision by the Comptroller stirred an outcry among Democrats, who in the end acknowledged that Mr. McCall could not have made any other decision, lest he be accused of being political.
"The Comptroller's hands were tied," said Michael G. Breslin, the Albany County Executive. "They snuck this deal by him on a technicality. It's clear that the Governor is directing what on the face appears to be a simple contract between Fleet and I.B.M."

HEADLINE: Benefits From Transit Spending Said to Outweigh Costs by 5 to 1

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
For every dollar that local officials spend on mass transit in the New York region, residents get back about five dollars in economic benefits, a Federal report states.
The report, released this week by the Federal Transit Administration, found that residents in areas with large mass transit systems, like New York City, already save $30 billion each year in transportation costs by relying more on mass transit, and that improvements in public transit would increase these savings. 
 The study is the first time Federal officials have attempted to quantify the economic and related benefits of spending on mass transit. And at a time when mass transit agencies across the country are competing with public schools and the health care industry for scarce public funds, officials say they hope this report will highlight mass transit's importance and its economic worth.
The report estimated that while officials in New York and northern New Jersey spent $4.2 billion on mass transit in 1994, the region received $20 billion in benefits because of cheaper public transportation, more vibrant neighborhoods and business centers, and less traffic.
"This report makes the case why we should subsidize transit," said Gordon J. Linton, the administrator of the Federal Transit Administration, which distributes Federal money for mass transit. "While transit does not pay for itself, the benefits far outweigh the investment," he said.
The report looked at the economic impact of mass transit on major cities and small towns across the country. In Chicago, for instance, officials spent roughly $1 billion on mass transit, and received an estimated $5 billion in benefits; Philadelphia spent half a billion dollars and got $2 billion in benefits, and Washington spent about the same amount and got about $3 billion.

HEADLINE: Dole and Ethanol Industry Count on Each Other

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
Last September, just as the House was set to gut the billion-dollar subsidy that supports the ethanol industry, Senator Bob Dole paid a call on Speaker Newt Gingrich.
"Senator Dole was there to say this thing was going nowhere in the Senate," recalled Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, who attended the meeting. 
 Faced with opposition from Mr. Dole, the majority leader, and other farm-state Congressmen, the Speaker had the bill killed. Mr. Dole had preserved the subsidy and saved the ethanol industry $1.8 billion.
At a time when Congress has been overhauling the nation's systems of agricultural subsidies, and public officials across the country have considered huge cuts in benefits to big corporations, ethanol has been untouched. Largely through the efforts of Mr. Dole, it has remained one of the most subsidized American industries. The meeting with Mr. Gingrich was only the most recent occasion in which Mr. Dole has rescued ethanol, a corn-based alcohol that is mixed with gasoline to create gasohol.
Gasohol was first touted in the 1970's as a miracle product that would ease American dependence on foreign oil, improve income for farmers and help the environment. Those assertions have been challenged, but Mr. Dole, both in public and behind closed doors, has exerted his political muscle to protect the industry, saying that by doing so, he was helping Midwestern farmers. Along the way, he has also helped his biggest financial patron, Dwayne O. Andreas.
Mr. Andreas's company, Archer Daniels Midland Company, dominates an American ethanol industry that by most accounts would not exist without the estimated $6 billion in Federal subsidies it has received since Mr. Dole sponsored legislation establishing the tax break nearly 20 years ago.
Mr. Dole has never concealed his relationship with Mr. Andreas, one of the most politically active executives in the country. Now, as Mr. Dole closes in on the Republican Presidential nomination, an examination of his unwavering backing of ethanol provides a window on how the Senator operates at the intersection of business and politics.
Mr. Dole's efforts on behalf of the ethanol industry have come even in the face of opposition from powerful Republicans like President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Dole has helped erect trade barriers to foreign ethanol and has engineered an anonymous amendment that effectively shuttered the Caribbean ethanol industry for three years.
"As a national leader on agriculture policy, Senator Dole is a longtime supporter of this clean-burning all-American renewable fuel to promote new markets for American grain, jobs for our nation's farm belt, and energy self-sufficiency," his office said in a statement released last week, which added that Kansas has 13,500 corn farms and four ethanol plants.
Over the years, Mr. Andreas, his family and his colleagues have been among Mr. Dole's most generous political supporters, contributing $228,800 to Mr. Dole's political organizations since 1979.
They have also given $1 million to the American Red Cross since Mr. Dole's wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, became its president in 1990.
Mr. Dole has also flown often on A.D.M. jets and collected thousands of dollars from the company for speeches before such payments were banned.
Mrs. Dole bought the couple's beachfront apartment in Florida from Mr. Andreas for a price that was questioned as possibly below market value.
A.D.M. has other political allies. Indeed, Mr. Andreas, the wealthy chairman of A.D.M., has been a well-known contributor to both parties since the early 1970's, when he gave President Richard M. Nixon $100,000 in cash and was acquitted of illegally donating $100,000 to Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey's 1968 Presidential campaign. From 1988 to 1994, he and others associated with A.D.M. contributed $1.6 million to the Republican Party and $814,000 to the Democratic Party.
In 1994, Mr. Andreas was co-chairman of a Democratic fund-raising dinner and contributed $100,000 to the event.
A few days later, under prodding from the White House, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a ruling requiring that one-tenth of all gasoline contain ethanol.
The White House denied any connection between the events. A Federal appeals court overturned the rule.
"Ethanol is a textbook example of an industry that simply would not exist were it not for very generous tax subsidies and pure political muscle," said Stephen Moore, a director at the Cato Institute, a research organization based in Washington that is opposed to subsidies.
 
Friends in High Places
From Its Inception, Industry Had Help
From the start, ethanol has depended on its friends in Washington, and none has been more loyal than Mr. Dole.
When the Arab oil boycotts created long gas lines in the 1970's, gasohol, which is one part ethanol and nine parts gasoline, was seen by some as an alternative to foreign oil. Today Americans burn 1.4 billion gallons of ethanol a year in their gas tanks.
Mr. Dole has promoted ethanol since 1970 when he urged President Nixon to study grain-based fuels to help fight pollution. By then, he also was close enough to Mr. Andreas to have pushed the Environmental Protection Agency to hire his son-in-law, William McMurtrie, as an enforcement lawyer.
"Senator Dole's office called and absolutely insisted on the appointment of William McMurtrie," according to a memorandum written by John D. Ehrlichman, an assistant to Mr. Nixon, on Aug. 25, 1971.
In fact, while another memorandum shows that Mr. Dole was frustrated during those years by his inability to land Federal jobs for his own constituents, he pushed hard enough at the E.P.A. to assure Mr. McMurtrie's appointment.
Mr. McMurtrie, who kept the E.P.A. job for about a year, said in an interview that he did not know whether Mr. Andreas had intervened on his behalf.
The first major Federal outlay for ethanol, a $60 million loan program for new distilleries, was passed by Congress in 1977 over the objections of the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Dole was one of the bill's sponsors, and A.D.M. started ethanol production that year.
"Bob Dole and Dwayne Andreas argued that there was a national security issue here, and it was on that basis that it was sold to the Congress and the public," said Bob Bergland, Secretary of Agriculture at the time under President Jimmy Carter. "Our studies showed that ethanol took more energy to make than it produced."
A year later, Mr. Dole sponsored legislation creating the ethanol subsidy. President Carter signed the bill in 1979.
The subsidy provided gasoline marketers with a tax credit for the ethanol they used in gasohol. The exemption has since risen to 54 cents a gallon.
The subsidy translates into less tax revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, which finances road and bridge repairs.
The Treasury Department has calculated that the exemption has cost the fund $5.9 billion since 1983.
A.D.M. has dominated the industry from the start, and controls roughly 50 percent of the American market today. Analysts estimated that about 10 percent of its $12.6 billion in revenues last year came from ethanol.
 
Cost-Benefit Analysis
Its Value Is Unclear, But Support Is Firm
For years, Government studies have questioned ethanol's value. A 1986 Department of Agriculture study said that, by driving up demand for corn, the subsidy raises food costs for consumers. "Direct cash payments to corn growers would be more economical than attempting to boost farm income through ethanol subsidies," the report concluded.
Advocates argue that ethanol burns cleaner than gasoline, and studies show that it does reduce certain pollutants. But the Congressional Budget Office said last year that ethanol's quick evaporation, especially in hot weather, contributes to ozone pollution.
Mr. Dole dismisses the criticisms. "Senator Dole's support for ethanol is quite simple," said the statement from his office. "It's good agriculture policy, it's good energy policy, it's good for the environment."
Mr. Dole has gone to some lengths to protect the industry. In 1980, he pushed through the Senate a bill to impose tariffs on Brazilian ethanol and later forced the reversal of a Customs Service ruling that would have allowed some Brazilian ethanol into the country duty free.
In 1982, President Reagan told Congress he wanted to eliminate "ineffective business subsidies," including ethanol tax breaks. Mr. Dole, then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, pledged publicly to save the subsidy. He did so.
The year Mr. Dole saved the subsidy, his wife bought a three-room apartment in the Sea View Hotel in Bal Harbour, Fla., from Mr. Andreas, who was chairman of the corporation that controlled the hotel.
When the transaction was disclosed in 1987, questions were raised about whether the $150,000 price was the fair market value. The purchase would have to have been at market value to comply with Senate rules.
A Sea View official, who asked not to be identified, said Mr. Andreas had set the price "as a personal thing." A similar unit two floors below the Doles' apartment had sold a few months earlier for $190,000.
Mr. Andreas declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed for this article. In 1987 he and the Doles defended the price as fair.
 
Working Things Out
Dole's Persistence Has Often Paid Off
Not all Mr. Dole's efforts on behalf of ethanol have been public. Buried within the 1986 tax reform bill was Amendment 423, one of many measures protecting special interests inserted during closed-door talks.
Former Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Chicago Democrat who was the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee then, said Mr. Dole was so predictably loyal to ethanol that it could be used against him in negotiations.
"Archer Daniels Midland is an Illinois company, but I was never supportive because they had a champion in Bob Dole," Mr. Rostenkowski said in an interview. "I'd argue against ethanol because I knew I could get something for it from Dole."
The stage was set for the Dole amendment in 1983, when Congress approved a development plan dropping import duties on Caribbean products under certain conditions.
American ethanol producers complained that the plan gave the Caribbean producers an unfair advantage.
When the tax bill was passed, Amendment 423 required that Caribbean ethanol be 70 percent locally produced to qualify for the duty-free status. Meeting that proved too expensive to allow the Caribbean producers to compete.
In 1989, Mr. Dole attached to a trade bill a provision extending the domestic ethanol subsidy to 2000.
Mr. Dole temporarily blocked a vote on the trade bill in an effort to win passage of the extension. Eventually he accepted a deal in which the extension was eliminated and he was promised hearings on the issue in 1990. But then Mr. Dole simply attached the 10-year extension to the 1990 tax bill.

HEADLINE: New York's Dynamic New Media

 BODY:
New York City is justly proud of its world-class television, book publishing and newspaper industries, which are mainstays of the regional economy. But according to a study released yesterday by a state development agency, these traditional businesses are not the largest media industries in the region. That honor belongs to the new-media industry, the typically small businesses that sell interactive software and on-line computer services.
The study, based on surveys, interviews and analysis by the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, estimates that there are more than 4,000 new-media companies in the metropolitan region, employing over 70,000 workers. In New York City alone there are about 1,350 such businesses with more than 18,000 full-time employees. By comparison, television hires about 17,000 workers and the book industry accounts for fewer than 14,000. 
 New-media companies are clearly becoming a dynamic core of the regional economy. The question that emerges is whether the city is nurturing or squelching the industry's vibrancy.
New York has the potential to become the nation's focus of this new industry. New-media companies write entertainment and business software and design services that businesses provide over the Internet, the worldwide network of computer users. These companies hire creative and technical personnel who work with advertisers, publishers, educators, financial services experts, broadcasters, fashion experts and artists. New York offers a rich array of people for new-media companies to hire and an equally rich array of customers, especially in advertising and publishing, who seek computer outlets for their products.
Interactive computer companies in the region expect to double or triple their employment over just the next three years. However, they pinpoint threats that could stymie these rosy projections. One threat is taxes -- in particular the stiff taxes the city imposes on small-business owners. The unincorporated-business tax and related measures hit entrepreneurs with a second layer of taxation, on top of personal income taxes. New-media companies are almost all entrepreneurial-based. They also complain of infrastructure roadblocks, such as the excessive time and expense of installing high-speed telecommunications lines for computer data.
New-media owners are not calling for special tax breaks, subsidies or targeted infrastructure projects. Instead they want measures, such as reducing small-business taxes, that companies in most industries would find useful. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will find it hard to accommodate that request in a budget that is already cash-starved and underfinances education and other key services.
New York is ideally positioned to incubate interactive computer business as it roars into the 21st century. It need not do anything special for these companies. But it has an even harder task -- removing the barriers that face every small business struggling to survive in a high-cost city.

HEADLINE: Clinton Visits Korea and New Peace Talks Are Proposed

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: CHEJU, South Korea, Tuesday, April 16

 BODY:
Against the backdrop of recent North Korean military incursions into the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, President Clinton and President Kim Young Sam of South Korea today proposed four-party talks intended to bring about a permanent peace agreement that would replace the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War.
The two leaders unveiled their plan for the talks -- which would include the two Koreas, China and the United States -- as Mr. Clinton, who has styled himself an international peacemaker in this election year, began a one-week trip focusing on security issues in Asia and Russia. 
 A joint statement released after Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kim met on this resort island off the southern coast of South Korea said the two Presidents had proposed to convene a four-party meeting "as soon as possible and without precondition" to "initiate a process aimed at achieving a permanent peace agreement."
"North Korea has said it wants peace," Mr. Clinton said at a joint news conference with Mr. Kim. "This is our proposal to achieve it and we hope and expect Pyongyang will take it seriously."
North and South Korea have been at a stalemate for 43 years following a bitter war on the peninsula that was ended with a 1953 armistice agreement that imposed a cease-fire and set up a demilitarized buffer zone but stopped short of a permanent peace.
Mr. Kim said the proposal had already been conveyed to China and North Korea. "Of course we do not expect that North Korea can respond to our proposal positively tomorrow," he said. But he added: "Time is on our side and I think that this is perhaps the last choice that North Korea can make to resolve the Korean question. I believe that eventually North Korea will accept our proposal."
As part of the joint statement, Mr. Clinton also pledged "the steadfast U.S. commitment" to the security of South Korea and reafffirmed the strength of the security alliance under which 37,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea. And he reiterated several times at the news conference that the United States would not negotiate a bilateral peace agreement with North Korea. "We have made it abundantly clear that there will be no separate agreement between North Korea and the United states on the matter of the armistice," he said.
United States officials said that China had shown "understanding" of the desire to iniaite a North-South peace dialogue and that Japan and Russia has also been briefed on the proposal. A South Korean official said the reaffirmation of the United States support for South Korea combined with the peace overture was intended to "make North Korea not feel able to reject the offer."
North Korea has made little secret in recent years that it wants to dismantle the armistice that ended the Korean War and replace it with a peace treaty between itself and the United States, bypassing South Korea. In late February North Korea proposed an "interim peace agreement" to be negotiated with Washington. The United States pronounced the idea unacceptable.
Since then North Korea has taken steps that American officials have interpreted as an attempt to force direct talks with the United States by creating a crisis atmosphere on the Korean peninsula, where the cold war has never thawed.
Recently North Korea announced that it would no longer honor the terms of the Military Armistice Agreement, and its troops stripped off their required armbands. Then over successive Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights this month, North Korea moved an increasing number of troops -- up to 300 -- into the demilitarized zone 30 miles north of Seoul, setting up offensive positions with mortars before leaving.
The movements violated the armistice, which allows no more than 35 soldiers and 5 officers with side arms to enter the demilitarized zone. And they underscored the continuing conventional military threat on the peninsula despite 1994 and 1995 negotiations that led North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program in exchange for being supplied with modern atomic power plants and fuel oil.
As part of the initiative by the United States, South Korea and Japan to provide North Korea with substitute nuclear reactors to secure the shutdown of reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium, North and South Korea were supposed to move into direct dialogue. But the talks have never begun.
Administration officials said the United States and South Korea began exploring a way to start a dialogue between the North and the South two months ago, before North Korea began its incursions into the demilitarized zone. Mr. Clinton added the South Korea stopover to his itinerary once it became clear that the leaders would have a proposal to unveil.
A similar proposal for six-way peace talks offered under the Bush Administration did not produce any results. But the Clinton Administration seems to feel that the economic situation in the North has deteriorated to the point that its leaders might now grasp at some way to become more integrated into the world.
Mr. Clinton's visit to South Korea and Tokyo comes at a time when not only the North Korean incursions but also China's recent military exercises in the Taiwan Strait have caused ripples of concern across Asia. The President is expected to pledge during his visit that the United States will remain the dominant military power in the Pacific, despite recent base closings in the region.
Later today Mr. Clinton was to fly to Tokyo for a two-day state visit. Its centerpiece is to be the signing of a joint security declaration that reaffirms the alliance between the United States and Japan and calls for Tokyo to increase its logistical support for American troops.

HEADLINE: Kennedy Introduces Measures To Cut Layoffs From Mergers

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Senator Edward M. Kennedy introduced tax legislation today intended to discourage layoffs resulting from corporate mergers, as part of a package of proposals designed to help workers.
The bill would disallow tax deductions for interest paid to finance mergers and acquisitions. "In the 1980's it was commonplace for financiers to borrow the funds to make the acquisition with the express intent of selling off the assets and casting off the workers to raise the money to pay back the debt," Mr. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, said. 
 The bill also sought to broaden antitrust laws so that when a potential merger was challenged in court, the judge would have to consider not only its effect on competition but also "the interests of workers and local communities." It would require that when stock buyers notify the Securities and Exchange Commission of acquisition of major blocks of stock, they must also notify it of plans for layoffs and shutdowns that could result from the acquisition.
Stressing the themes that Congressional Democrats hope President Clinton will emphasize in this year's campaign, Mr. Kennedy told the Senate, "The 'quiet depression' facing American workers is the central economic, social and political issue of 1996. When the economy is wrong, nothing else is right."
The measure would also establish tax breaks and preferences in Government contracts for companies with above-average records of wage increases, investment in training and education for workers along with health care, retirement benefits, profit sharing, as well as provision of child care for all employees by companies with more than 500 workers.
Mr. Kennedy also proposed establishing an individual pension program so workers in companies not providing pensions could put up to $9,500 of their own money into portable pensions that would be operated by groups like chambers of commerce. The only burden on employers, he said, would be to require them to deduct a worker's pension payment from the pay.
Mr. Kennedy conceded that Republicans were unlikely to hold hearings on his proposals, let alone bring them to the floor. But he said the tax and pension plans would be offered as amendments if any tax legislation came before the Senate. The antitrust plan, he said, would be proposed as an amendment to unrelated legislation this year.
Senate Republicans then underscored their unwillingness to deal with Democrats on work issues by insisting that no amendment to increase the hourly minimum wage to $5.15 from $4.25 by July 4, 1997, be offered today.
Unless Democrats agreed to put that issue aside at today's session, Republicans said, they would refuse to take up the illegal immigration bill and instead spend the day in meaningless roll-calls.
The most complicated provision of Mr. Kennedy's bill concerned worker-friendly companies, and it was drafted in hopes of encouraging support by stockholders. Qualifying companies would be allowed to deduct from their taxable profits 25 percent of dividends paid to stockholders. They would also be able to win Federal contracts if their bids were no more than 10 percent above the low bid.
Companies would qualify by certifying to the Labor Department that they met or exceeded the bill's standards, including putting 8 percent of payroll into employee health care, 8 percent into retirement benefits and 2 percent into education and job training.

HEADLINE: Nairobi Journal;
Take (On) the Minibuses, if You Dare

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, April 15

 BODY:
Forget this country's flagging economy and rampant corruption. The hottest political issue in Kenya these days is what to do about the local version of mass transit: those speeding, overloaded, exhaust-belching minibuses and minivans known as matatus.
A plan to install speed-recording devices on the minivans to reduce the number of traffic deaths has set off a political storm that has been felt all the way up to President Daniel arap Moi's office. The devices are small computers that record speed, braking distances, fuel consumption and other data, and the police can tap into them when they stop a vehicle. 
 The matatu owners and drivers, a powerful and volatile lobby, have staged strikes, held rallies and promised to make the gadgets -- nicknamed black boxes -- a litmus test in the coming presidential election. Earlier this month, the President shelved the plan indefinitely.
"If the Government insists about the black box, we will be on the move," said Jonas Kariuki, who directs passengers for several matatu operators in downtown Nairobi. "It will be a strike."
Matatus (the Swahili term roughly translates as "cooperatives") are ubiquitous in East Africa. In Kenya, where the public bus system barely functions and most people cannot afford cars, they are the main means of transportation.
The colorful little buses swerve in and out of traffic, boldly scoot along the wrong side of the road, pass on hills and career along the potholed city streets at speeds of 75 miles an hour or more. Custom-built on the top of truck chassis, they are emblazoned with names drawn from popular culture: Wing Commander, Boyz II Men, Love Boat, Banana Peel.
At rush hours, the minivans are usually packed with 10 or 11 more people than they can legally hold. Having paid 30 cents to climb aboard, the riders are crammed in four and five abreast on seats meant for three. Some sit on top of each other, some even in the driver's lap.
The conductors cling to the outside, riding with their feet on a running rail and singing out to passengers. On some buses, disco music is pumped at deafening volume.
But if most Africans depend on matatus to get around, they also fear them. The drivers are legendary for their recklessness, and the police blame them for Kenya's high death toll on the road -- 2,617 last year. Kenya has a death rate several times higher than Europe or America, with one death for every 166 vehicles per year. (California averages one fatality for every 6,200 vehicles.)
George Karioki, 48, an accountant who commutes on matatus every day, said he never feels safe on them. "They are reckless in driving and they don't observe the traffic rules," he said.
So motorists and matatu patrons greeted with joy the Government announcement earlier this year it was going to require the speed recorders. President Moi was seen by many as finally taking a tough stand.
Not so fast, said the matatu operators. They were incensed about the $1,400 price tag for each device and a little suspicious of the deal. The Government, no stranger to sweetheart contracts and kickbacks, had given the franchise for the devices to a single company.
Opposition politicians quickly asserted that the Government had given special treatment to the company. Transportation officials and the company denied any wrongdoing.
"It was something fishy," said Jimmy Mzee, a 36-year-old matatu owner. "I believe this is a deal between these influential businessmen and these big men at the ministry."
Last month, the matatus rebelled, employing one of the ruling party's top officials, Kuria Kayingi, as a lobbyist. Thousands rallied against the black-box plan. Mr. Kayingi led a delegation of 600 noisy matatu operators to visit the President at his residence. Then came a work stoppage on Easter weekend.
Though their union was banned in the 1980's, the matatu workers still vote as a bloc. In the 1992 elections, they threw their weight behind the opposition candidates. But at the rally, they made it clear they would stand behind President Moi's party this time, as long as he rejected the black boxes.
On April 7, the President, suspended the black-box idea and directed the Transportation Commissioner to come up with a new plan. President Moi suggested that speed governors, which limit how fast a car can go, might be a better solution.
Waiting in long lines in downtown Nairobi, several riders said their interests had been forgotten in all the political maneuvering. Many said they prayed every time they boarded a matatu that they would live to see their homes.
"They never care about safety," said Linda Kagwiria, a 35-year-old store clerk. "Too many people are always in the car. You can't breathe."
For their part, the matatu drivers blame the poor condition of the roads and police corruption for the daily road carnage. Potholes and bubbled-up pavement are everywhere, while shoulders and traffic signs are nonexistent, they said.
But the biggest problem, operators say, is that the police care more about extorting payments than enforcing traffic laws. The black boxes, they contend, would just give officers one more pretext for extracting bribes at the many roadblocks the police set up during rush hours.
Once bribed, the drivers say, the police turn a blind eye to bad brakes, speeding, overloading, drunken drivers and other safety hazards.
"They just stand there and ask for money," said one driver, Charles Karau, a 14-year veteran. "If you speed or you don't, they don't care."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 24, 1996, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 16 about attempts to improve the safety record of the taxi fleet in Nairobi, Kenya, misstated the etymology of the Ki-swahili colloquialism for the minivans that make up the bulk of the fleet. Matatu, literally meaning threes, derives from the fare of 30 cents (mateni matatu, or three 10-cent pieces) originally charged by drivers, not from the practice of people banding together to operate the taxis. This correction was delayed for consultation with authorities on Kiswahili.

HEADLINE: Feasting on Crumbs of America's Love Affair With Bread

BYLINE: By JACK BISHOP 

 BODY:
TRADING up from squishy white bread to artisanal loaves has had an unforeseen consequence in many kitchens. All over America, stale hunks of crusty bread are being tucked away in bakery bags or thrown in the back of the refrigerator, growing older and harder by the day. Handmade loaves are superior to sliced white bread in every respect but one -- staying power.
So what's an economical cook to do with leftover country-white and whole-wheat bread? 
 Italian cooks have been confronting this problem for centuries and have developed strategies for recycling stale bread. These tricks can't resuscitate a week-old, rock-hard loaf, but will give new life to bread that is a few days old.
In Italy, homemade bread crumbs often take the place of grated cheese in pasta dishes. This is especially true with seafood sauces, since Italians consider the marriage of fish and cheese to be odder than that of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. (Just try asking a Roman waiter for cheese with your linguine and clam sauce.) Traditionally, stale loaves are grated by hand, and the coarse crumbs are toasted in a skillet to a rich golden-brown color. A food processor fitted with a metal blade speeds the grating.
Homemade bread crumbs are coarser and more flavorful than commercial varieties. They are also used with vegetable pasta sauces. Southern Italians who could not afford Parmesan from the north relied on this embellishment in dishes like linguine with garlicky spinach.
A second option for stale bread is to use it as a flavor absorber in salads, soups and sweet puddings. Tuscans add stale bread cubes to a tomato salad called panzanella. The bread soaks up some of the dressing, as well as juice from the tomatoes. The tough cubes swell and soften to make a delicious and filling salad.
Stale bread also adds bulk to peasant soups. These recipes, many of which originated in hard times, show the Italian passion for transforming simple foods into transcendent meals. For instance, stale bread turns a basic potato and spinach soup into a meal. A drizzle of olive oil adds luxury to this modest dish.
Finally, stale bread can live again in baked puddings. Cubed bread absorbs the custard and helps cut the richness in eggy desserts. Grappa-soaked raisins give bread pudding a characteristic Italian flavor.

Spaghetti With Scallops, Lemon and Bread Crumbs
 Total time: 30 minutes

 2 cups stale bread cut into half-inch cubes
 1 pound spaghetti
 Salt to taste
 6 tablespoons olive oil
 3 medium garlic cloves, minced
 2 tablespoons lemon juice
 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
 1/2 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes or to taste
 1 pound sea scallops, tendons discarded, cut into 3/4-inch cubes.

 1. Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot.
 2. Place the bread cubes in a food processor fitted with the metal blade, and grind into coarse crumbs, about 1 minute. Place the bread crumbs in a large skillet set over medium heat. Toast, shaking the pan often, until the crumbs are golden brown. Remove the crumbs from the pan, and set aside.
 3. Add the spaghetti and salt to taste to the boiling water.
 4. While the pasta is cooking, briefly heat the oil in the empty skillet. Add the garlic, and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Stir in the lemon juice, parsley, hot red pepper flakes and salt to taste. Cook for 30 seconds. Add the scallops, and cook, stirring often, until they are opaque and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Do not overcook the scallops. Adjust seasonings and keep sauce warm.
 5. Drain the spaghetti when al dente, but do not shake bone dry. Transfer the spaghetti, still dripping with a little cooking water, to a large bowl, and toss with the scallop sauce. Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and toss well. Divide pasta into individual bowls, and serve immediately.

 Potato, Spinach, and Bread Soup
 Total time: 50 minutes

 1 1/2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled, cut into half-inch cubes
 4 1/2 cups chicken stock or water (see note)
 4 cups packed stemmed spinach
 leaves, washed, dried, and cut into 3/4-inch-wide strips
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
 2 cups stale bread cut into half-
inch cubes
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or to taste.

 1. Place the potatoes and chicken stock or water in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, and simmer briskly for 15 minutes.
 2. Add the spinach, salt and pepper to taste, and cover the pot. Continue cooking until the potatoes are falling apart and the spinach is tender, about 10 minutes.
 3. Turn off the heat, stir in the bread cubes and cover the pot. Let stand for 5 minutes or until the bread is very soft. Adjust the seasonings, and add hot water to taste to thin the texture if desired. (This soup is designed to be quite thick but can be thinned to any consistency.)
 4. Ladle the soup into bowls. Drizzle 1/2 tablespoon oil over each bowl, and serve immediately.
 Note: This peasant soup is traditionally made with water. Homemade chicken stock adds richness and flavor and is a first choice. Avoid canned chicken broth, which does not nearlyadd the flavor of homemade.

A consolidation of offices for the Gay Men's Health Crisis in a new lease on West 24th Street.

BYLINE: By Mervyn Rothstein 

 BODY:
THE Gay Men's Health Crisis, the country's oldest and largest AIDS service organization, has leased a 150,000-square-foot building at 119 West 24th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue.
The organization plans to consolidate its offices, now spread out at five sites in the Chelsea/Midtown South area of Manhattan, and offer all its services at the new location. The 15-year lease was valued at $25 million. 
 Mark Robinson, the executive director of the group , said it had decided to stay in the Chelsea area, "as long as we could work it out economically," because "we were spawned in Chelsea, and the majority of our clients come from here and the Greenwich Village area."
"From an economic and space standpoint," Mr. Robinson said, "this building met all our requirements."
The organization will initially use 108,000 square feet of the building. Stephen Soba, a spokesman, said that two floors occupied by other tenants would be taken over when the leases expired and that the organization was looking into collaborating with a medical center to provide medical care on another floor.
Mr. Robinson said that no money allotted for programs would be used for renovation and construction. A campaign to raise capital funds has begun, he said, with the move to the new building expected to be completed within a year.
Louis Bradbury, the board president, said the move would provide improved services with "significant savings in our overall occupancy costs." He said it would also allow the organization to open the David Geffen Center for H.I.V. Prevention and Health Education.
The agency, which is entering its 15th year, now has space at 20, 121 and 129 West 20th Street, 11 West 19th Street and 160 Eighth Avenue, at 18th Street.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein of the Edward S. Gordon Company, who with his colleague Laurence Elbaum represented the tenant, said the building, which was formerly used primarily for manufacturing and as a warehouse, provided a "very efficient office layout."
The 12-story loft building has 12,000-square-foot floors and a basement, Mr. Bernstein said. "From the sixth floor up, there are generous windows on all four sides," he said. "Even though it's a midblock building, the buildings around it are all low-rise, and there is light all the way up the back." Frank Ring represented the owner, F. M. Ring Associates.
 
Infinity Broadcasting Move
 The Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, the nation's largest independent broadcasting company, has leased 27,000 square feet, the 14th and part of the 15th floor, at 40 West 57th Street, a 700,000-square-foot office building between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas. The building is owned by the LeFrak Organization.
Infinity, which broadcasts the Howard Stern and Don Imus shows and owns 34 radio stations nationwide, including WFAN in New York, will be moving its corporate headquarters from 600 Madison Avenue, at 58th Street. The 15-year lease was valued in excess of $12 million.
Susan Kahaner of the Edward S. Gordon Company, who represented the tenant with her colleague Mary Ann Tighe, said Infinity had "very strict requirements" for its new offices. "Howard Stern and the other stars were seeking privacy and discreet access," Ms. Kahaner said. "So they were looking for a building with a garage where the limos could pull right in and the stars could go up through the service elevator and avoid fans waiting outside."
In the new offices, she said, Mr. Stern is to get the "studio of his dreams -- a duplex, with very high ceilings."
Mitchell Rudin, director of Gordon's owner-representation division, who represented the building, said it was now 98 percent leased.
 
Technology Center Lease
 The Westcon Services Corporation, a computer training and development company, has leased 16,000 square feet, the entire eighth floor, at 55 Broad Street, the New York Information Technology Center. Neil Joffee of Newmark & Company Real Estate Inc., who represented Westcon, said the 10-year lease was valued at $2.6 million. Westcon, based in Eastchester, N.Y., is to move its New York City office from 3,500 square feet at the Empire State Building.
The new lease is the biggest so far at the technology center, a 400,000-square-foot, formerly vacant office building at Beaver Street in lower Manhattan. Nine months after the Rudin Management Company announced it was spending $15 million to renovate the building and install modern telecommunications equipment, more than 184,000 square feet, or close to half the building, has been accounted for.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
The High Cost of a Fine Smoke

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
The fall of the Soviet Union and rising American animus toward one of Marxism's last bulwarks are taking a sharp toll on an illicit pleasure: the consumption of Cuban cigars.
Though illegal to import, buy or sell here since President John F.Kennedy imposed a trade embargo on the Castro regime in July 1963, Cuban cigars had always remained relatively plentiful -- until late February. Now, smokers say, a box of Cubans is extremely difficult to find. And with prices doubling and tripling, only an elite few can afford those that are available. 
 The roots of the shortage are in the confluence of ideology and economics, experts and connoisseurs say. Since the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, Cuba's increasingly isolated tobacco farmers have suffered shortages of raw materials, from fuel and fertilizer to twine and boxes. Production fell to 50 million cigars last year from 90 million in 1990.
This winter, the industry appeared to be on the mend. Several European importers -- notably Tabacalera, Spain's state-owned tobacco company -- had written checks to needy Cuban tobacco farmers, but the money apparently arrived too late to avert another disaster. Despite a strong tobacco crop in January, farmers failed to produce enough quality capas, the leaves that provide the outer wrappers for cigars.
Meanwhile, the Clinton Administration, outraged after the Cuban military shot down two American civilian planes in February, has tightened enforcement of the trade embargo, through which cigars habitually had slipped. Recent seizures of illegal Cuban cigars in Florida and en route from Mexico to Texas appear to have stymied many smugglers, United States Customs Service officials believe, further diminishing the thin supply of Havanas.
The results of all this are prices that catch in the throats of the most devoted smokers.
Those who want a box of Cuban large brands -- Cohiba Robustos, Romeo and Julieta Churchills, or Double Coronas, cherished for their 8-inch lengths -- may have to shell out $400 to $700 for a box of 25 on the black market, up from $250 last year, according to cigar industry officials and suppliers in the Caribbean. A price list of black market Cuban cigars, seized by United States Customs last fall, had a box of 50 Coronas going for $650. Two Cuban cigar suppliers said that same box of 50 Coronas would fetch at least $850 today.
"The prices of all cigars have gone up within the past year," said Marc Tassy, the manager of Havana House, the exclusive distributor of Cuban cigars in Canada. "On the black market in the U.S., these smugglers have discovered a product they can get a ransom for."
Smokers say normal supply channels have been disrupted. Some of the business executives recently savoring Cubans at Beekman Bar and Books, a plush smoking room on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, said the only Havana cigars they could come by lately were those they sneaked home from European business trips.
"I can't tell you how much I enjoy the taste of a Cuban cigar," said Michael, a Manhattan investment banker who declined to be identified by his last name. "The trouble is that it's really tough to get a Cuban cigar in the States these days. The ones you can find all cost too much. When I go to Europe on business, I'll buy a couple and stick them in my luggage. I don't have another way of getting them."
The shortages are not limited to the United States. "The worldwide demand for these cigars is still around 100 million," said Simon Chase, marketing director for Hunters & Frankau, the distributor of Cuban cigars in Britain. "Cuban cigars are hard to come by even in countries where they're legal. In Havana some of the tobacco shops can't get them."
The acute shortage of Havanas has transformed the American cigar market. Smokers could once be confident that a Cuban cigar purchased from a tobacco store or smuggler was authentic, but no more. Of the seven million cigars posing as Cubans that are expected to be smuggled into the United States this year, cigar industry officials believe that two million will be fakes.
"Counterfeiting Cuban cigars is now a big business," said Norman Sharp, president of the Cigar Association of America, an industry group. "All the counterfeiters have to do is say a box of cigars is Cuban and then try to rake in all these exorbitant prices. A lot of inexperienced smokers won't be able to tell the difference."
The best of the counterfeit Havanas are made in Honduras or the Dominican Republic, where the tobacco quality closely resembles Cuba's, then sent to the United States or Mexico to be boxed. Some get new cigar bands before being sold to unsuspecting tobacco stores.
All this infuriates American cigar makers, who estimate that they lose $50 million to $75 million each year to Cuban smugglers and counterfeiters. "A fellow can't smoke two cigars at once," said Richard DiMeola, executive vice president of Consolidated Cigar Corporation of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., America's largest premium cigar maker, and a unit of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. "For every Cuban cigar sold, that's one that we didn't sell."
Part of the increased interest in Cubans can be traced to the recent boom in cigar smoking. Americans bought 163 million premium cigars last year, according to the Cigar Association of America, up from 97 million in 1991. But American cigar makers point fingers at another source: Marvin Shanken and his Cigar Aficionado magazine.
Mr. Shanken, the son of a New Haven jewelry retailer, rolled out Cigar Aficionado in September 1992, just as the United States premium cigar boom was beginning. The magazine soon became a sort of Town & Country for cigar smokers, featuring photos and profiles of cigar-chomping celebrities like Lauren Hutton and Matt Dillon.
But critics in the industry say the magazine has a bent for Cuban cigars. The spring issue, currently on newsstands, includes an article arguing for an end to the Cuban trade embargo and another by Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist who is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations, in which he describes his "mooching" of Cuban cigars.
What is especially galling to American cigar makers is Mr. Shanken's rankings of the best smokes, in which Cubans always come out on top. In the spring issue, Mr. Shanken rates Coronas, and indeed, Cuban brands receive the top two scores. The top American Corona -- a La Gloria Cubana -- finished 16th.
"To say that Cigar Aficionado promotes a black market product is silly," Mr. Shanken said. "How can I put out a serious cigar magazine that's an international publication and not include Cuban cigars? A lot of the people in the business frown on it because they can't participate in that market. But when our readers travel to Europe they can buy a box of Cubans and smoke them there."
For those who have yet to try a Cuban cigar, finding one in the United States will not be easy. Federal regulators have been cracking down on most of the popular smuggling routes. "This isn't a very sophisticated network of smugglers," Mr. Sharp said. "It's not like the smugglers who bring in cocaine."
The Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department, which enforces economic embargoes and sanctions, believes most of the Havanas come by boat through the Caribbean. Others come across the Canadian and Mexican borders in cars and trucks. Smugglers commonly change the labels on the cigars from Cubans to Hondurans and then repackage them in boxes from South America. Once the cigars are in the United States, they are reboxed and relabeled to reflect their Cuban origins.
American cigar makers are especially riled by cigars sold through the mail -- mainly by well-known European retailers. "I bet more than half of the Cuban cigars that make it into this country are delivered by the U.S. Post Office," said Lewis Rothman, president of JR Tobacco of Statesville, N.C., whose mail-order, wholesale and retail businesses provide 40 percent of the premium cigars sold in the United States. "The Customs people can't look at every box, and if the cigars have had a make-over -- new label, for instance -- they might not be spotted."
There is only one legal way to bring Cuban cigars into the United States People who travel to Cuba legally -- to visit family members, conduct academic research or on a journalist's visa -- are allowed to carry home up to $100 worth of Cuban goods as gifts, according to the Customs Service.
At today's prices, however, $100 may buy only enough cigars to whet a smoker's yearning for more.

U.S. Bonds In the Shadow Of Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly lower in moderate trading yesterday, despite a drop in commodity prices that eased some inflation concerns.
A report showing a slump in industrial production in March failed to generate optimism in the market that the economy was growing slowly enough to prevent inflation from accelerating. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32 of a percentage point, to 89 31/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, edged up to 6.79 percent, from 6.78 percent on Monday.
Prices for Treasury bills were stronger, with the rate on the three-month bill dropping to 4.81 percent from 4.83 percent.
The Federal Reserve reported yesterday that industrial output fell five-tenths of 1 percent in March. But the slump was attributed to a strike and subsequent shutdown of assembly plants at General Motors.
"Auto and truck production will rebound in April," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "and it will come on top of an industrial sector that grew at a half a percent per month pace during the first quarter, excluding the motor vehicle sector."
Christopher A. Low, senior economist at HSBC Group in New York, said that industrial production "on full evaluation was just about in line with expectations" and agreed that industrial production would bounce back.
"However, there is no evidence of significant strength outside of the auto sector," he noted.
Bond prices did receive some support from sharp declines in several commodity indexes.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities, which was at eight-year highs two weeks ago, dropped 3.44 points yesterday, to 255.84, led by falling corn and crude oil prices. The energy-weighted Goldman Sachs Commodity Index fell 4.85 points, to 208.55, its biggest drop since early February.
"The bond market has been watching commodity prices closely, worried about inflation, so this came as very good news," Mr. Low said.
Still, Robert T. Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told the Reuters news service that he was not optimistic about inflation this year. But Mr. Parry is considered an inflation hawk and, in any case, is a nonvoting member of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates.
The market will look for more clues to the direction of the economy in today's report on housing starts in March. And tomorrow, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is scheduled to release its survey of regional business conditions.
The Philadelphia Fed survey is the last significant report to be released until United States trade balance data on Tuesday. "The Philly Fed survey could certainly have a greater market impact than normal given the data vacuum following its release," Mr. Fine of Chase Asset Management said. "In the meantime, the Fed remains on hold."
He added: "While the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index has lifted modestly as of late, moderate economic growth should keep inflation restrained over time. But make no mistake about it, the Fed is at a heightened state of alert vis-a-vis inflation and inflationary expectations, which certainly reduces the already lowered probability of the Fed easing even further, while at the same time keeps the bond market ever vigilant toward potential Fed tightening."

HEADLINE: Swastikas and Similar Graffiti Spread in the Nation's Capital

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
A problem that has long plagued downtown Washington, the defacement of newspaper boxes and trash bins by spray-painted swastikas and SS logos, appears to be spreading into residential communities where many of the city's Jews live.
And while the increasing number of Nazi insignias in those neighborhoods is raising concern about the message of hate that the symbols convey, there is also a growing concern that the city is not responding adequately. 
 The District's financial crisis has forced the Department of Public Works to abandon a war against graffiti of any kind, and the Police Department has only rarely arrested anyone for painting Nazi symbols on public or private property. That combination has led some residents to take matters into their own hands, by spray-painting over the offending symbols.
"We are poor," said Linda Grant, a spokeswoman for the Public Works Department. "We are without the kinds of funds that we can arm public works employees with the supplies to go out there and remove these things."
Officer Anthony O'Leary, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the department took all hate crimes seriously, including the painting of such graffiti. As for investigations, "we do what we can," he said.
That has not been enough to calm an outcry from residents who feel threatened by the symbols. Laura Kam-Issacharoff, special projects coordinator of the Washington office of the Anti-Defamation League, said that in recent months her office had been flooded with telephone calls from District residents, most of them Jews living in the northwest section of the city, complaining about the appearance of Nazi symbols in their neighborhoods.
"They're coming from all over the northwest," Ms. Kam-Issacharoff said of the calls as she walked along streets there today, pointing to swastikas painted in white or neon-orange on newspaper boxes. "To say there's no money, that's like giving a license to people to do it and giving them a platform for hate."
She said her usual response to the callers was to urge them to paint over the symbols -- "I tell them, 'We'll bail you out if you get arrested' " -- or to join the A.D.L.'s third annual volunteer effort to remove the graffiti, scheduled for next week.
The spread of Nazi symbols in the nation's capital, some just blocks from the White House and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, comes at a time when by some estimates the number of anti-Semitic incidents around the country has declined.
In an audit of acts of bigotry toward Jews in 1995, the national office of the Anti-Defamation League found that the number of incidents nationally had declined by almost 11 percent from 1994, the first drop in three years and the largest in the 10 years that the organization has taken such surveys.
But in the District of Columbia, the number of anti-Semitic incidents rose. Indeed, in a breakdown of all 50 states and the District, the increase in the number of such incidents here, 22, was second only to California's increase, 32.
The spray-painting of Nazi symbols is one kind of act monitored by the A.D.L., and an exception to the rarity of arrests for it here occurred recently: Esyededeea Aesfyza was charged in early January with one count of destruction of property, a misdemeanor, accused of spray-painting a swastika on a traffic-signal box near the Capitol.
Mr. Aesfyza, a native of Greece who was homeless at the time of his arrest, is free in his own recognizance and faces a maximum of 180 days in jail if convicted.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Lower Over Prospect That Japan May Increase Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped yesterday after the head of Japan's central bank hinted that Japanese interest rates might be heading higher.
The dollar sold off in Tokyo after the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, said a prolonged easy monetary policy helped create Japan's "bubble economy" of inflated stock and land prices in the late 1980's. 
 While Mr. Matsushita's comments appeared simply to reflect the conventional economic wisdom, currency traders inferred his words as a signal that rates would rise.
"The comments out of B.O.J. appear to be putting the market on some kind of warning that the low interest rate monetary policy that has been pursued, and which has been supporting dollar and yen, may be coming into question," said Stephen Flanagan, currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 108.15 yen, from 108.55 on Monday. The dollar was quoted at 1.5089 marks, down from 1.5127. The British pound rose to $1.5077 from $1.5075.
Mr. Flanagan said the prospect of higher interest rates in Japan had prompted investors to reverse a so-called yen-carry trade.
In such a trade, speculators borrow in yen at low Japanese interest rates to buy higher-yielding non-Japanese assets. In reversing that trade, they buy back yen. That helped push the yen broadly higher against the United States and Australian dollars and European currencies.
"The Bank of Japan is clearly putting the market on notice that this yen-carry trade could have some risk," Mr. Flanagan said.
Currency traders said there was strong interest from Japanese banks and corporations to buy dollars at about 108 yen, which kept the dollar above that level.
The dollar's weakening against the mark came as doubts crept into the market about a German interest rate cut this week, traders said. Of 15 economists surveyed in Germany, only 3 predicted that the Bundesbank would cut its important discount and Lombard rates at today's council meeting.
The diminishing prospects for a rate cut lifted the mark against the dollar. Lower interest rates tend to make a country's assets relatively less attractive.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Prices Reverse as Corn and Oil Plunge and Gold Follows Drop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Corn and crude oil prices plunged yesterday on indications that low inventories of both commodities would be replenished in coming months.
Falling commodities markets also pushed gold lower as the drop in raw materials eased concerns that inflation would accelerate. The Commodity Research Bureau index fell 3.44 points, to 255.84, its largest drop since March 1, as 14 of its 17 components fell. The energy-weighted Goldman Sachs Commodity Index fell 4.85 points, to 208.55, its biggest drop since Feb. 5. 
 Corn prices plunged as warm weather and generous rains begin to provide farmers with excellent planting conditions.
Rain totaling as much as 1.5 inches in some areas is forecast for the Corn Belt this week, according to Accu-Weather Inc., moistening the soil for farmers who begin planting the bulk of this year's crop next week.
With corn reaching record prices this month, and the new farm bill removing many restrictions on what farmers must grow to qualify for subsidies, analysts are now expecting an above-average crop.
"The feeling is with this moisture they are going to get after plantings and we are going to get every acre we can," said Don Roose, analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.
Corn for July delivery fell the 12-cent daily trading limit, to $4.30 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade. The drop in corn pulled wheat prices lower. The active July wheat contract plunged 19.5 cents, to $5.3125 a bushel.
Crude oil settled lower, after first reaching its highest price since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, amid speculation that Iraq would eventually agree to a limited oil sale being offered by the United Nations.
May crude oil fell 59 cents, to $24.47 a barrel, at the New York Mercantile Exchange, after trading as high as $25.70 a barrel earlier in the day.
Gold fell as the declines in commmodity indexes eased concerns about a pickup in inflation. Some investors buy gold when inflation threatens the value of other assets.

HEADLINE: Dole Wavers On Extending Trade Rights For China

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
In the first indication that Washington's dealing with China could become a major campaign-year argument in Congress, Senator Bob Dole appeared to back away today from years of support for extending broad trade privileges to Beijing, saying he had not decided whether to oppose the Clinton Administration's efforts to renew those trade rights this spring.
Mr. Dole has been under sharp pressure from the right wing of his party to abandon the traditional Republican position that the best way to influence China's behavior is to engage it economically. But as recently as a few days ago, when he canceled a major speech on his policy toward China, his advisers insisted that he was still firmly in favor of "most-favored nation" status for China, on which billions of dollars of trade with American companies -- and perhaps the economic futures of Hong Kong and Taiwan -- depend. 
 Today, however, Mr. Dole wavered. Emerging from a meeting with former President George Bush, who has just completed a trip to China, Mr. Dole said, "We'll be developing our position on it very soon."
For Mr. Dole, as for Mr. Clinton, China's trade status poses some agonizing problems. His home state of Kansas is the site of a major Boeing plant, where one in seven jets goes to China. Agricultural companies, among his biggest supporters, have warned that ending China's trading preferences would be a disaster for them.
And Mr. Dole has a long record of statements in support of trade concessions that sound much like Mr. Clinton's arguments.
"I strongly support most-favored nation status for China," he said on "Larry King Live" on March 23, 1994. "I think we make a mistake when we tie it to human rights." Cancellation, he said, would "cost us a couple of hundred thousand American jobs." In 1992 and 1993, when Mr. Clinton was wavering on the issue, Mr. Dole was urging him to "move ahead on most-favored nation status for China where, again, Republicans would support the President if he'll come out and do that."
Some Republicans have urged Mr. Dole to turn the extension of trade privileges into a referendum on Mr. Clinton's dealings with China, with an eye toward putting Mr. Clinton in the embarrassing position of vetoing a Congressional resolution to end China's trading rights here.
"It would be a very tough veto in an election year," one of Mr. Clinton's top aides said recently, worrying that the President could appear to be defending China's leadership.
American business has strongly urged the extension of China's trading rights, and successfully pressed Mr. Clinton two years ago to reverse himself and "delink" favorable trade status from China's human rights performance. Until today, Mr. Dole -- whose Kansas constituencies include major exporters to China -- seemed firmly in the Clinton camp.
Like Mr. Dole, the Administration is also concerned that its policies not cost America lucrative contracts. Just today the Export-Import Bank of the United States approved a $160 million loan guarantee for a Chinese airline to buy three Boeing jets. In February, Secretary of State Warren Christopher had asked the bank to suspend consideration of loans for all projects in China for 30 days until he decided whether and how to sanction China for selling $70,000 of ring magnets to Pakistan. But Mr. Christopher is still weighing his decision, both because of legal complexities and because the Administration is still trying to hone in on a sanction that would show American toughness but not prompt retaliation.
No decision is expected until he meets Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China on Friday, American officials said. Mr. Christopher is to break off from President Clinton's trip to Russia to meet Mr. Qian in The Hague. Officials at the Ex-Im Bank, an independent agency, said they had to move ahead because China was already giving more aircraft contracts to Europe.
The sanction Mr. Christopher has in mind would prevent the Ex-Im Bank from aiding a Chinese company that was linked to the ring magnet sales. But it would also hurt two major American companies, Westinghouse and Bechtel.
The Administration had hoped that its threats of sanctions against China would defuse the calls for the repeal of favorable trade status, which permits the Chinese to get the benefits that America extends to its other major trading partners -- including low tariffs for its goods. But liberals outraged by the human rights record of China and conservatives outraged by its threats against Taiwan are aligning in the House of Representatives to vote against the trading rights after Mr. Clinton formally notifies Congress of his intentions. He must do so by June 3.
"We're going to lose the House on this," a top Administration official said recently. "The issue is the Senate, and specifically Bob Dole."

HEADLINE: Korea Convergence

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: CHEJU, South Korea, April 16

 BODY:
With their proposal for peace talks with North Korea today, President Clinton and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Young Sam, have broken new ground and raised a spark of hope that the last front of the cold war will finally see what Mr. Clinton called "an ultimate reconciliation."
Such hopes have tantalized all concerned in the past only to be dashed, so people in South Korea are greeting the announcement today with caution. Still, American and South Korean officials say a constellation of factors -- the economic troubles and famine in North Korea and election-year politics in the United States and South Korea -- make this a propitious time to try once again to achieve the elusive peace that would formally end the Korean War. 
 The two leaders, after a brief meeting this morning on this resort island, publicly invited North Korea to take part in peace talks involving four countries -- the two Koreas, the United States and China. The talks would begin as soon as possible and without preconditions.
"North Korea has said it wants peace," President Clinton said at a news conference with President Kim. "This is our proposal to achieve it. And we hope and expect Pyongyang will take it seriously."
In agreeing to four-way talks, South Korea has relaxed its insistence that any peace treaty be negotiated only by the two Koreas.
"The South Korean position is showing more flexibility than in the past," said Lee Jong Suk, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute, a private research organization in Seoul. "So even if North Korea rejects the proposal, the possibility of future negotiations is now open, and in this sense it is a breakthrough."
But Moon Chung In, a professor of political science at Yonsei University, said the proposal has "no real impact, only symbolic impact."
Turning even a symbolic advance into an actual peace treaty will be difficult. It is still not known whether North Korea, which was informed of the proposal in advance, will accept it. The Russian news agency Itar-Tass quoted North Korea's Ambassador to Moscow, Song Sung Pil, as saying North Korea would reject the offer and insist on talks only with Washington.
Even if the Communist nation accepts the proposal, negotiations no doubt will be arduous, as were the 1994 talks over ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program. And even if an agreement is reached, there is no guarantee it will be honored.
China has also not yet agreed, although American officials said Beijing had expressed "understanding." Russia, which would be left out of the talks, has expressed an interest in having a role, South Korean officials said. Japan, meanwhile, expressed support for the proposal.
But American and South Korean officials are gambling that North Korea will come to the table to help ease its economic woes.
"Time is on our side," President Kim said, adding that he believed the proposal might be the only choice that North Korea can make "to resolve the Korean question." "And I believe," he said, "that eventually North Korea will accept our proposal."
A peace treaty would clear the way for increased economic ties for North Korea with South Korea and the United States. But even before a treaty would be signed, Washington and Seoul said they would consider interim "confidence-building measures." These could include economic aid as well as military moves such as pulling some troops back from the front lines.
But the two leaders today announced no immediate aid for North Korea. A South Korean official said his nation had decided not to give any more rice to North Korea unless it responds positively to the proposal for peace talks.
President Clinton also reaffirmed today that the United States would not hold talks with North Korea alone, thereby seeming to rule out the option that North Korea prefers.
On the military front, signing a peace treaty would help eliminate the threat that war could be re-ignited. North Korea has already denounced the 1953 armistice agreement that has governed the truce. Two weekends ago, it sent heavily armed troops into the joint security area in the demilitarized zone, a violation of the armistice.
American and South Korean officials insist that today's proposal was being discussed by them for two months and is therefore not a response to North Korea's recent actions. But the incursions heightened the sense of urgency to replace the armistice with a permanent peace.
Prospects for peace have been raised before. In late 1991 and early 1992, the two Koreas negotiated and signed an agreement calling for reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and denuclearization of the peninsula. But the agreement broke down once North Korea threatened to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1993.
In 1994 Kim Young Sam and Kim Il Sung, the North Korean leader, agreed to hold their first summit meeting. But the North Korean died before such a meeting could be held.
The Geneva agreement later that year defused the threat of North Korea's nuclear weapons program and raised great hopes of reconciliation. But the North-South talks outlined in that agreement were never held.
The proposal for talks among four parties or among six parties -- with Russia and Japan included -- have also been bandied about for years. The United States proposed such ideas in 1988 and 1991 but neither the Koreas nor China were interested.
Election politics appeared to play some role in bringing forth today's proposal. Some South Korean officials said President Clinton, who was not even intending originally to visit South Korea on his current trip to Japan and Russia, needed something concrete to announce here to show that he is keeping American troops from being killed in a conflict.
President Kim was able to announce the proposal because elections for South Korea's National Assembly are now behind him, with his party having done better than expected despite losing its majority. Until the election last Thursday, Mr. Kim feared taking any conciliatory steps toward North Korea because it would alienate conservative voters.
But pressure has been building on South Korea to become more flexible, in part because its resistance has prevented the United States and other countries from giving more food aid to North Korea that could help prevent an economic collapse.
"There's no question who our ally is," an American official said recently with some exasperation. "We just wish our ally would be more forward-looking."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Quarterly Net Is Up 20% At Times Co.

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported yesterday that its first-quarter earnings rose nearly 20 percent, slightly exceeding the expectations of most Wall Street analysts.
The main reason for the higher-than-expected profits, analysts said, was the ability of the company's newspapers to increase advertising rates and circulation charges over the last year without losing large numbers of advertisers or readers. 
 The success of that strategy, analysts said, reflected the strength of the company's two largest newspapers, The New York Times and The Boston Globe. "The growth in advertising and circulation revenues, especially at The Times and The Globe, is impressive," said Mary Ann Winter, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. "The quarter's results show that the company was correct in aggressively raising its circulation and ad rates."
The Times Company's net income for the first quarter totaled $32.7 million, or 33 cents a share, up from $27.4 million, or 28 cents a share, in the 1995 first quarter. The latest quarter's results exceeded an average estimate of 30 cents a share by Wall Street analysts, according to Zacks Investment Research.
Revenues increased 9 percent, to $622.5 million, from $571 million in the quarter a year earlier.
The Times Company's shares rose 50 cents yesterday, closing at $31.625 on the American Stock Exchange.
The company's earnings rose despite a decline in profits at the magazine group and a 45 percent increase in the price of newsprint, the main raw material used to produce newspapers.
Operating profits for the magazine group, whose titles include Golf Digest, Tennis and Cruising World, fell to $7.1 million in the latest quarter, down from $10.2 million in the 1995 quarter. Revenues slipped to $40.7 million, from $40.9 million in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts said magazine advertising was soft this year.
The company's broadcast group, which has six network-affiliated television stations and two New York City radio stations, reported improved results. The broadcast group increased its operating earnings to $3.4 million in the latest quarter from $2.7 million a year earlier. Revenues rose to $21.5 million from $17.2 million.
The Times Company derives about 90 percent of its revenues from the newspaper group, which in addition to The Times and The Globe includes 21 regional newspapers. Operating profits for the newspaper group rose to $61.1 million, from $50.9 million in the 1995 quarter, while revenues rose to $560.3 million from $513 million.
At The Times, revenues increased nearly 12 percent, to $322.3 million. The size of The Times's revenue gain was at least twice the expected increase for most other big newspapers, according to John S. Reidy, an analyst at Smith Barney Inc.
Executives of the Times Company were also encouraged by the increasing share of the newspaper's advertising and circulation revenues that now comes from outside the New York metropolitan area, making the paper less dependent on swings in the local economy.
Today, about half The Times's revenues come from the rest of the Northeast and from its national editions. "The Times has become more a demographic product and less a geographic product, not a local newspaper per se," said Diane Baker, the company's chief financial officer.
The Times Company is also investing more aggressively in new ventures, like electronic versions of its newspapers on the Internet's World Wide Web. In the newspaper group alone, the new-venture investment translated into a loss of nearly $2.4 million for the first quarter. In the 1995 quarter, the loss attributable to new ventures in the newspaper group was $103,000. The new ventures are expected to break even within three years, Ms. Baker said.

The results included income from joint ventures of $4,682,000 for the latest quarter and $2,076,000 for the year-ago period.

HEADLINE: Cab Owners Fight Order To Get Costly New Cars

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
It might be called "The Case of the Vanishing Taxi Fare Increase." Ask passengers about the 20 percent rise in fares in March, and they will say they certainly feel the difference. But thousands of independent taxi owners who drive their own cars or lease them out say the bonanza they were promised by the Taxi and Limousine Commission has disappeared. And they say it doesn't take a Sherlock Holmes to figure out where it went.
They say they will lose most of the extra $15 to $25 they earn every day because of the commission's new rule, linked to the fare increase, that requires owners to replace old cars with new ones every four to five years. And, cabbies will have to buy brand-new cars instead of used cars, as was common. 
 "They give you a raise and they take it right back," said Rafael Maysonet, president of the Association of Independent Taxi Drivers, a group of 500 Hispanic drivers. "We're really hurting."
As a result, a group of small taxi owners has taken steps to sue the city over the new-car requirement.
In retaliation, the Taxi and Limousine Commission is considering repealing a 14 percent increase in the rental fees that cab owners can charge individual drivers for leasing their taxis. The increase was a central component of the commission's decision to raise fares.
The commission's vote on the issue, due tomorrow, could begin unraveling the carefully wrought fare structure instituted in January. The commission's idea was to improve service for riders, both because cabs would be newer and because experienced cabbies making more money from higher fares would be encouraged to stay in the business longer.
"They agreed to the terms and conditions of the increase," said Marvin Greenberg, the senior Taxi and Limousine commissioner. "For them to enter the courts and try to stop this is deplorable. If they don't want the requirements, they should have none of it."
The issue hardly concerns large fleet owners, who routinely replace their cars every two and a half years. But the independent owners are not only suing the city, they are lobbying city officials to reverse the rule. On April 22, the City Council's Transportation Committee will begin a hearing on a bill to repeal the regulation, said Councilman Noach Dear, chairman of the committee.
Mr. Dear, a Democrat of Borough Park, Brooklyn, called the regulation unfair and unnecessary. The condition of the car is more important than its age, he said.
But Taxi and Limousine officials insist that the fare increase, the first since 1990, will bring drivers enough extra money not only to meet the new-car requirement, but to earn up to $5,000 a year more.
"Even with the new-car requirement, at the end of the day, there is plenty of money to afford these basic and reasonable requirements," said Christopher R. Lynn, the chairman of the commission.
By setting a mandatory retirement age for cars, the commission is tacitly admitting that its monitoring of the condition of taxis is inefficient, said Edward G. Rogoff, a professor of management at Baruch College who studies the taxi industry.
"I think they should regulate the condition of the car, not its age," Mr. Rogoff said. "It's a reflection of their inability to monitor the conditions of the vehicles."
On March 1, the price of a yellow taxi ride increased to $2 for the first one-fifth of a mile, up from $1.50. The cost of each additional fifth of a mile in unclogged traffic became 30 cents, up from 25 cents. The charge for being stopped or moving slowly remained at 20 cents.
That increase was necessary without any additional strings attached, drivers said. They said that a car in good condition that passes the commission's inspection, which three times a year examines everything from exhaust to the color of the car, should not have to be replaced automatically because of its age.
Under the commission's rule, to take effect Nov. 1, fleet owners must replace their cars every three years. An owner-driver who shares the car with another driver has to replace the car every four years, and a sole owner-driver is required to change that car every five years.
Many owner-drivers say they are barely getting by now and will be even worse off if they have to buy a new car every five years. According to commission records, 1,154 cabs, or roughly 10 percent of the city's 11,787 cabs, are driven by owner-drivers who own both the car and the medallion. Perhaps 3,000 more drivers also own their cabs but lease the medallions from someone else.
Most people at the wheels of yellow cabs are lease drivers, who rent their cabs for the day or the week from the people who own them or from middlemen. These drivers have benefited from the increase.
"It's been better than before," said Gerard Paul, 42. "Hopefully, it will be even better."
To insure that lease drivers benefit from the fare increase, the commission for the first time limited to 14 percent the rise in lease rates that medallion owners could charge drivers. The owners have often raised their leasing fees whenever fares have gone up.
Adding to the owner-drivers' usual anxieties is that the city will auction 100 medallions for the first time in 60 years. And a month or two after a fare increase goes into effect, riders are usually reluctant to ride and tend to tip less generously, said Mr. Rogoff. Eventually, riders return to their old pattern, he said.
Marcel Fils-Aime, a cabby for eight years, said that his insurance payment went to $277 a month from $229 a month a few months ago. About three years ago, the city's Finance Department increased by tenfold a tax stamp that cabbies pay, to $1,000 from $100.
"When I heard we were going to get a raise, I was very happy," Mr. Fils-Aime said. "But now when I look at it, it's not much. I don't feel the difference at all."
Drivers now pay $75 to $100 for a 12-hour shift, or about $450 to $650 for a weekly lease. The driver must also pay for gas, at $15 to $20 a shift. Drivers keep whatever fares and tips they collect.
The average cabby collects 30 fares per 12-hour shift, the commission says, so the higher fares would mean an extra $30 a day on average.
That figure is hotly disputed by the drivers, whose lawyer's survey put the increase closer to $2,500 a year, or about $15 more per shift. And that figure is offset by inflation and higher cost of doing business, they said.

HEADLINE: G.M. Strike Drags Down Industrial Output

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
Weighed down by a 17-day strike at the General Motors Corporation, industrial output slumped five-tenths of 1 percent in March to match the biggest declines since the final stages of the 1990-91 recession, the Federal Reserve reported today.
But excluding the lost output of vehicles and parts, production climbed three-tenths of 1 percent to support the growing consensus that the economic boiler has picked up steam but is no danger of overheating. 
 "All things considered, the industrial production data indicate slow but steady growth," the National Association of Manufacturers said in a statement. After flirting with a downturn in late 1995, it added, "we are back on a slow-growth track."
Looking beyond the month to the full first quarter, output climbed at a 2.7 percent annual pace, compared with a six-tenths of 1 percent rate in the last quarter of last year, the central bank's figures showed. The step-up was less than it appears, however, since the earlier period was depressed by a strike at the Boeing Company.
Unlike many recent statistics, today's results were largely as expected and had no discernible effect on securities markets.
In addition to the output data for March, which showed gains for mines and utilities but a decline of eight-tenths of 1 percent for factories, the central bank reported a decline in the operating rate of American industry.
Plants ran at a relatively comfortable 82.5 percent of capacity, markedly below the 85.1 percent peak for this expansion reached just over a year ago and seven-tenths of a point under the February pace.
"There's a lot of capacity that we could use before we have price pressures," said Maria Fiorino Ramirez of the Wall Street firm bearing her name. "The Fed's going to stay status quo for a while."
The G.M. strike showed up throughout the report, pushing output of automotive products down about 15 percent, transit equipment down 11.7 percent, consumer goods down nine-tenths of 1 percent and factory durables down 1.4 percent.
Vehicle assembly tumbled to an annual rate of 9.9 million vehicles from 11.9 million, with autos, light trucks and heavy and medium trucks all lower, the report showed. In the second quarter, G.M. plans to recover nearly a third of the production it lost during the strike.
The computer and office equipment category was again a star performer, rising 3 percent to bring the 12-month gain to a stunning 38.9 percent as companies seek to raise productivity by substituting machinery for labor wherever possible.
Output of consumer goods, by contrast, declined slightly over all during the last year, with production of clothing -- facing strong competition from imports -- down 9.1 percent.
Production of construction supplies rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month and at a 2 percent pace for the first quarter, down from a 6 percent pace in the final three months of 1995.
Total output was revised upward by one-tenth of a point for each of the first two months of the year, the Fed also reported, with January's decline now put at three-tenths of 1 percent and February's gain now 1.3 percent.
The eight-tenths of 1 percent decline in factory output, reflecting the G.M. strike, was the biggest monthly drop in five years. The rise for mines and oil wells was 2 percent last month while utility output advanced seven-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
CATERPILLAR INC. (CAT,N)

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc.'s first-quarter earnings fell 1.3 percent, to $296 million, from $300 million in the corresponding quarter of 1995, though per share earnings rose to $1.53 a share, from $1.50, as the company bought back shares through the quarter.
The per share earnings exceeded analysts' predictions of $1.49 a share, based on the average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Still, Caterpillar shares fell $1.125, to $70.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., said sales fell 1.8 percent, to $3.84 billion. The company said United States sales declined 5 percent because of a lingering economic slowdown that it expected to continue. Sales outside the United States, which account for 49 percent of the total, were roughly unchanged.
The company said it expected worldwide sales to be somewhat lower this year because improved sales in developing nations and in Europe would not offset lower sales in the United States, Canada and Australia.
During the latest quarter, more than 8,000 striking members of the United Automobile Workers union returned to Caterpillar without a contract. (Bloomberg Business News)

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Turns Aside Criticism in G.A.O. Report

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board dismissed most of the criticisms of its management today that had been included in a recent report to Congress, and said that it ran itself as efficiently as any company or Government agency.
The Fed was responding to a draft report from the General Accounting Office, the Congressional auditing agency, released last month by two Democratic Senators. The report said that the central bank had been lax in controlling its costs and questioned whether the Fed was adequately preparing itself for changes in the financial world. The report did not address the Fed's conduct of monetary policy. 
 In a letter accompanying the Fed's 12-page rebuttal, the chairman, Alan Greenspan, said that the G.A.O. report included some suggestions about how to find more cost savings that were "potentially quite helpful" and that the Fed would apply them "where appropriate." Among these were recommendations that the Federal Reserve study harmonizing the policies on travel expenses among its 12 regional banks and find ways to share more information among the banks about effective procurement practices.
But in a clear indication that the report would not prompt the Fed to make drastic changes in the way it operated, the central bank said either that it was already doing what the report suggested or that it disagreed with the report's analysis and recommendations.
Addressing a central conclusion -- that the Fed had allowed operating expenses to grow too quickly at a time of belt-tightening throughout the Government -- Mr. Greenspan said the Fed's performance, by at least one measure, was in line with the Federal Government over all.
The Federal Reserve's operating expenses rose 50 percent from 1988 to 1994, to $2 billion a year, a rate of increase that was twice that of inflation and nearly triple the rate of growth in overall Federal spending. But Mr. Greenspan said the rate of growth during the period in discretionary Federal spending was a fairer comparison, and that by that measure, the growth in the Fed's operating expenses was slightly below those of the Government.
The Fed also took issue with the G.A.O. report's conclusion that the growth in its employee-benefits payments was much greater than for Government employees. Using a different method of calculating the growth than the G.A.O. did, the Fed said that growth in benefits costs from 1988 to 1994 was about the same as for the Government.
The G.A.O. report said that the Federal Reserve had amassed a surplus on its books of $3.7 billion, ostensibly to cover losses, despite the fact that the Fed had never come close to a loss. The Fed responded that "the appropriate level of the Federal Reserve surplus is open to debate."
But it went to say that turning the surplus over to the Treasury would have little economic advantage for taxpayers, and could create risks. It said that it had on many occasions suffered short-run losses that required borrowing from the surplus, and that any perception among investors of even the most temporary problems "could prompt questions in the minds of some investors in dollar assets, including holders of Federal Reserve notes, about the continued ability of the central bank to conduct monetary policy."
The report's recommendation that some of the 12 Fed regional banks and 25 branches be consolidated was all but dismissed. Such a process, the Fed said, would be "very costly, and the long-term savings would have to be substantial to offset the transition costs."

HEADLINE: Wildcat Walkout Is Ended At Big G.M. Assembly Plant

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 16

 BODY:
Striking workers returned to their jobs at a General Motors Corporation assembly plant tonight hours after G.M. once again displayed its aggressive new approach to labor relations, obtaining a Federal court order for an immediate end to the wildcat strike.
It was unclear how much effect the temporary restraining order from the Federal District Court in Cleveland had in ending the strike. Jim Tripp, the financial secretary of the United Automobile Workers union local in Lordstown, Ohio, said in an interview before the court order was issued that the union wanted a quick end to the strike. 
 The strike was not authorized by the national leadership of the U.A.W. and was prompted largely by G.M.'s dismissal of a popular local union leader.
Today's actions by G.M., the world's largest auto maker, were the latest evidence that G.M. had broken ranks with the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company in pursuing a confrontational policy toward the U.A.W., aimed at reducing G.M.'s labor costs, the highest in the industry. G.M. not only sought and obtained the court order today but also publicly accused the dismissed U.A.W. official in Lordstown of fraud, a charge the union denied.
The test of G.M.'s tough approach to labor relations will come this summer, when all three auto makers must negotiate three-year national contracts with the U.A.W. to replace agreements expiring on Sept. 14.
G.M. held out for 17 days last month when 3,000 workers walked out at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, and tried with mixed success to block state governments from paying unemployment benefits to U.A.W. workers laid off because of the strike. Earlier this month, G.M. announced that it would close an automotive generator factory in Michigan and try to sell three other parts factories in Michigan and Ontario.
That announcement provoked a lament last Friday by Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W. vice president in charge of relations with G.M. "I am disappointed, I am disgusted," he said in a speech. "That action obviously diminished the quality of the relationship that our union has with the corporation."
Chrysler and Ford continue to pursue warm relations with the U.A.W. in hope of limiting costly strikes. Both companies contend that they need to keep their workers happy because cars and trucks are becoming ever more complicated to build. And assembly plants are now more vulnerable to strikes at parts factories because parts inventories are being kept lean to save money.
G.M. today announced that last Saturday it had dismissed Al Alli, the chairman of the U.A.W. bargaining committee at the huge Lordstown plant, contending he had fraudulently used his time card to obtain pay for time not worked. "This is fraud, and it will not be tolerated by General Motors," said James R. Wiemels, a G.M. vice president, in a statement issued this afternoon.
Mr. Tripp denied that Mr. Alli had misused his time card or engaged in any fraud. He said that G.M. managers had demanded that Mr. Alli tell them where he was going every time he left the factory on union business, and that Mr. Alli refused to do so. G.M. executives said that more was involved, but declined to elaborate on Mr. Wiemels's statement.
Under G.M.'s national contract with the U.A.W., some local union officials are on G.M.'s payroll but work full-time on union business.
Mr. Alli's dismissal provoked the wildcat strike, which began on Monday morning when 1,800 workers on the day shift walked out. The U.A.W.'s national leadership in Detroit had not approved the work stoppage -- which violated the union's national contract with G.M. -- and urged with limited effect that the strike end immediately.
Part of the evening shift reported for work Monday night and part of the day shift reported today, not enough, Mr. Tripp said, to produce any cars.
But Ray Deibel, a G.M. spokesman, strongly denied this, saying that a "very limited" production of cars had taken place. Mr. Deibel and Mr. Tripp said tonight that full production had resumed on today's evening shift.
The Lordstown factory has at least 5,500 workers and normally assembles 6,500 to 7,000 Chevrolet Cavaliers and Pontiac Sunfires a week.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's New Agenda in Asia

 BODY:
When President Clinton first visited Japan in 1993, acrimonious trade issues dominated the agenda. Mr. Clinton is back in Tokyo this week, but the subject has changed. This time, both sides are stressing efforts to reinforce the United States security alliance with Japan. The shift is appropriate, given new military tensions in the region, and it promises to produce more harmonious relations between Washington and its leading Asian ally.
While both the Japanese and South Korean Governments welcome the American military presence on their territory, resentment has increased in some areas where the troops are concentrated. That is particularly true on Okinawa, which contains a disproportionate share of American bases and where resistance was fanned by the rape last year of a Japanese girl by American servicemen. To ease political pressures on Tokyo, Washington has agreed to shift some forces out of Okinawa to other Japanese locations. In return, Japan agreed today to stretch the limits of its pacifist Constitution with a joint declaration offering broadened support to United States military operations. 
 During a brief stop in South Korea, Mr. Clinton rightly rebuffed North Korea's latest bid to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul. Rejecting direct peace talks between the United States and North Korea, Mr. Clinton joined South Korea's President in proposing four-party talks, involving the United States, China and the two Koreas. The North may not accept the proposal. But broad regional talks are the right approach, and they should include Japanese and Russian participation.
The remarkable economic advance of East Asia over the past two decades has been built on the peace and stability assured by a strong American military presence. Victory in World War II, followed by interventions in Korea and Vietnam and the long vigil of the cold war, left the United States at the center of East Asia's security calculus. Washington, with no ambitions of its own in the region today, is a reassuring presence to small and medium-sized countries anxious about a newly powerful China or the possibility that Japan might someday rearm. The American presence is also a vital guarantor of South Korean security.
America maintains 100,000 troops in the Western Pacific, 47,000 of them in Japan and 37,000 in South Korea. Financial support by the host countries makes the cost of stationing these troops in Asia roughly the same for Washington as basing them in the United States. The Clinton Administration has pledged that the number of American troops will not be reduced. But uneasy Asian countries worry less about numbers than about Washington's constancy.
Mr. Clinton's dispatch of two aircraft carrier groups to the seas off Taiwan during Beijing's recent military exercises was greeted by most Asian governments with public silence and private relief. Ideally, American firmness should require neither military displays nor economic sanctions but steady insistence that all countries respect international laws and treaty obligations. America's goal with China should not be containing or isolating Beijing, but integrating it more fully into the international community and encouraging it to use its power responsibly.
Looking out for American business opportunities and enforcing trade fairness are still important American interests. But security issues cannot be neglected. The timing and substance of Mr. Clinton's visit are good. After the Chinese belligerence in the Taiwan Strait and reckless North Korean troop movements, it is not surprising that Mr. Clinton has found his Asian hosts receptive to American ideas for keeping their region calm, peaceful and prosperous.

HEADLINE: Doctor's Specialty Turns Out to Be Masquerade

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 16

 BODY:
Colleagues remember him as witty and charming, a crisp professional with a confident bedside manner, a flair for storytelling and a generosity of spirit that led him on risky overseas trips to provide free medical care for the poor.
Gerald Barnes, who held the post of chief physician at a prominent health clinic here, seemed to many the very embodiment of Hippocratic virtues. But he is not a doctor and has never attended a medical school, the authorities say, adding that, in fact, his only formal training in a health-related field is a bachelor's degree in pharmacology. 
 On Monday, Mr. Barnes, 62, was charged in Federal court with, among other crimes, fraud and practicing medicine without a license at the Executive Health Group, a downtown Los Angeles medical center specializing in preventive care and annual physicals, where he has worked since July 1995.
But he has long been masquerading as a doctor. In the late 1970's, according to court documents, after he legally changed his name from Gerald Barnbaum, he began impersonating an orthopedic surgeon from Stockton, Calif., named Gerald Barnes. And as Dr. Barnes, he embarked upon a career that was halted in 1981 with his guilty plea to involuntary manslaughter and practicing medicine without a license. He was sentenced to three years in a California prison and after serving 18 months, was released on parole in 1983. But then, the authorities say, he picked up where he had left off. Behind his smooth mask, they say, is a prodigiously talented con artist.
"For a person to try to assume the identity of a licensed individual is very unusual," said Candis E. Cohen, a spokeswoman for the medical board of California.
While the current complaint against Mr. Barnes does not name specific victims or incidents of harm, a person close to the case said that among Executive Health Group's clients are senior officials of the Federal Reserve Bank, the California Highway Patrol and other agencies, and major companies including Arco, Citicorp, Nissan, Ernst & Young and Hughes Aircraft.
Court documents also disclose that Mr. Barnes is believed to have performed medical examinations on "hundreds" of employees in the Los Angeles office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including special agents, which is the likely reason the investigation has led to Federal charges.
In a resume about Mr. Barnes that the company provides to prospective clients, he is listed as having received a doctorate in pharmacology from the University of Illinois and a medical degree from the University of Wisconsin. The resume also gives an extensive professional background for him, including 17 years of practicing general family medicine at the Garfield Medical Center in Illinois.
But this is the background of the real Dr. Gerald Barnes.
"Everyone who had contact with him thought he was a remarkable individual and an excellent physician," said Paul W. Frankel, a medical doctor who is president of the Life Extension Institute, a New York based company that owns the Executive Health Group, which has a contract to do physical examinations of senior executives of dozens of large companies, including The New York Times. "He was just the best."
Responding to the new accusations involving the other Barnes, the real Dr. Gerald Barnes said in Stockton, "It's the same guy who has been impersonating me."
"When it happened the first time," he continued, "I was driving home, and I heard that I had been picked up for manslaughter. It was kind of frightening."
In a crowded courtroom on Monday afternoon, Mr. Barnes, looking nervous and somewhat frail, clutched the podium with one hand and his forehead with the other as he stood before a Federal Magistrate, Rosalyn M. Chapman. Asked by the Magistrate if he was all right, Mr. Barnes responded in a barely audible voice, "I have diabetes and prostate cancer."
Magistrate Chapman set a bail hearing for Wednesday. Mr. Barnes is being held in a Federal holding unit in downtown Los Angeles, and officials close to the case said he was on a suicide watch.
Mr. Barnes was born and grew up in Chicago. As a youth, he was a talented actor, and even appeared in several traveling professional shows, said Frank Heckl, a retired senior investigator with the California Medical Examiners office who worked on the inquiry that led to the 1981 case.
After Mr. Barnes received his degree in pharmacology, Mr. Heckl said, he worked in a medical office in Chicago where he was known for being amiable and easy-going. Some colleagues even suggested that with his knowledge of medicine, he should try medical school and some patients referred to him as Doc, according to a 1985 article in Medical Economics, a trade journal, about people who falsely present themselves as doctors.
In the mid-1970's, Mr. Barnes lost his pharmacist's license, law-enforcement officials said, after being accused of Medicaid fraud. He then moved to California where he legally changed his name and began his career impersonating the real Dr. Barnes.
Much of the detail about how he was able to impersonate the real Dr. Barnes comes from the Medical Economics article, which said that he wrote California medical authorities on letterhead bearing the name Dr. Gerald Barnes and requested copies of records the doctor was required to file with the state. He explained that he needed the copies, Mr. Heckl said, because he had recently gone through a bitter divorce battle with his former spouse, and she had destroyed the originals.
With copies of these credentials, he worked back from the information he found in them, and wrote to request copies of the real Dr. Barnes's medical school degree and other credentials on Wisconsin and California. Armed with these documents, he obtained a job at a clinic in East Los Angeles, and later, a better-paying position at a medical center in Irvine, Calif.
The charade began to unravel in 1980, according to court documents, when a 29-year-old man came to him complaining of dry mouth and lips, sudden weight loss, dizziness and insatiable thirst -- classic symptoms of uncontrolled diabetes. Mr. Barnes ordered blood and urine tests, but sent the patient home, prescribing rest and a drug to treat the vertigo.
Two days later, the patient, John McKenzie, was found dead in his Anaheim apartment after lapsing into a diabetic coma. Mr. Barnes was subsequently charged with murder. He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and practicing medicine without a license.
Upon his release from the California Institution for Men at Chino, a minimum-security prison, Mr. Barnes got a job as a salesman for a industrial maintenance supply company in Anaheim, but by 1984 was working at a clinic in Orange County where he was arrested.
He pleaded guilty that year to two counts of grand theft for taking money from patients who believed that he was a doctor, and six counts of writing prescriptions without a license. He was sentenced to three years and four months in prison.
"Here was a very likable person who people generally enjoyed being with," said a colleague who has worked closely with him, but who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified. "He handled himself extremely well and seemed to know a good bit of medicine."

HEADLINE: Is North Korea Turning to Counterfeiting?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 16

 BODY:
With North Korea so poor that people are going hungry, some experts are worried that the Government there may be turning to a novel approach to raising hard currency: peddling counterfeit American money.
The evidence is far from conclusive, and North Korea denies that it is moonlighting as a counterfeiter. But the accusations have been boosted by the indictment last week in Thailand of a Japanese man who has close ties to the North Korean Government on charges of passing fake $100 bills. 
 At least three North Korean defectors also have charged that the country prints counterfeit dollars in a factory in the capital, Pyongyang.
President Clinton visited South Korea this week in part to discuss North Korea's recent behavior, particularly its incursions this month into the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea. If it turns out that North Korea is challenging the West not only with guns but also with bogus currency, the pressure to punish and isolate North Korea will grow, leading to further instability on the Korean Peninsula.
Extremely good reproductions of United States $100 bills have been turning up around the world in recent years, but investigators apparently made a big break early this year when Thai police arrested two local men on charges of passing phony bills and who, in turn, identified as one of their sources for the bills an alias for the man who was indicted in Thailand, Yoshimi Tanaka.
Mr. Tanaka was one of a group of Japanese leftists who hijacked an airliner in 1970 and defected to North Korea. Recently he has been spending much of his time in Cambodia, living at least part of the time in the North Korean Embassy there. He reportedly flew to Cambodia again late last month.
As soon as United States intelligence found out about this, American officials asked the Cambodian Government to arrest him. Apparently forewarned, Mr. Tanaka fled in a car with North Korean diplomatic license plates, carrying a North Korean diplomatic passport, and tried to drive across the border to Vietnam.
Prodded by the Americans, the Cambodian Government detained Mr. Tanaka, who is not an accredited North Korean diplomat, and handed him over to Thailand, where he has been interrogated by Thai and American officials. At a court hearing, Mr. Tanaka denied the charges and said that he was a North Korean who had never been in Thailand before.
North Korea, for its part, denounced as a "smear campaign" the suggestions that it is involved in counterfeiting. It did not deny that former hijackers like Mr. Tanaka may have been involved in counterfeiting, but it said that they remain Japanese and that any misconduct was their own affair.
"It is entirely according to their own will what they do anywhere outside" North Korea, the country's official press agency declared.
Still, there have been a number of other cases in which North Korea has been linked to high-quality counterfeit $100 bills. In 1994 police in the Portuguese enclave of Macao, near Hong Kong, detained four North Korean diplomats and businessmen who had deposited counterfeit money in a local bank. Police searches later found $250,000 in bogus American currency, but the North Koreans pleaded ignorance and were later released.
In addition, a Tokyo trading company that sold used cars to North Korea last year reportedly was paid $50,000 in counterfeit $100 bills. The notes in these cases were extremely well made, able to fool bank machines and many bankers. Other recent counterfeits have been dubbed "supernotes" because of their high quality, and have led the United States Treasury to rush the introduction of a redesigned $100 bill, which entered circulation last month.
Some intelligence experts say that the supernotes are being printed by Iran or Syria, and that North Korea may have obtained some as part of deals whereby North Korea sells weapons to Iran in exchange for crates of counterfeit currency.
Another theory is that North Korea is printing counterfeits on its own. Last year, a defector from North Korea, Kang Myong To, who identified himself as the son-in-law of North Korea's Prime Minister, charged that North Korea has been counterfeiting American $20, $50 and $100 bills since 1987.
Mr. Kang said that North Korea prints between $8 million to $10 million of counterfeit dollars each year and ships them by diplomatic pouch to China and the Middle East for distribution there. At least two other North Korean defectors have also accused North Korea of printing counterfeit Japanese yen and German marks as well as dollars.

HEADLINE: Pataki Weighs Alterations For Workers' Insurance

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 16

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki proposed legislation today to revamp the state's troubled workers' compensation system, saying his plan would reduce soaring insurance costs at least 30 percent.
The Governor's bill is his opening foray into what is considered one of the most important and complex issues facing the Legislature this year. Under intense pressure from business leaders, both parties have agreed that New York's high premiums -- which are paid entirely by employers -- are stifling job growth and driving companies out of the state. But they remain far apart in their solutions. 
 Mr. Pataki's proposal would restrict employers' liability in certain types of lawsuits, establish a uniform system for determining an injured workers' disability and prohibit workers from simultaneously collecting workers' compensation and unemployment insurance.
It would also increase penalties for defrauding the workers' compensation system and establish a new state agency to ferret out fraud. And it would create new penalities for employers with poor safety records.
"Our system is clearly broken," Mr. Pataki said, noting that New York's workers' compensation fees are 57 percent above the national average and higher than in all surrounding states.
Democrats, lawyers' groups and labor leaders were quick to criticize Mr. Pataki's plan, saying that high insurance costs resulted from price-gouging by insurers. They said that Mr. Pataki's plan would benefit insurance companies but jeopardize worker safety by restricting litigation against employers. "This isn't reform, it's robbery," said Edward J. Cleary, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 2.3 million workers.
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County who is among Mr. Pataki's strongest allies, called the Governor's plan "a solid basis for negotiations" and said that it included provisions similar to a plan being developed by the Senate.
Privately, however, Senate Republicans said that elements of Mr. Pataki's plan would face stiff opposition in their chamber, particularly the proposal to bar injured workers from collecting workers' compensation and unemployment insurance.
But business groups applauded the Governor's plan. "This bill will provide dramatic savings that small business needs right now to be able to afford to hire new employees," said Mark Alesse, the director of the New York chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business.
The state's workers' compensation system was created in 1914 to provide weekly payments to workers injured on the job until they could return to work. It was designed to be "no fault," meaning that employers would assume all liability for workplace accidents, regardless of fault. In exchange, workers could not sue employers for workplace accidents.
But over the years, the courts have broadened employers' liability in workers' compensation. In the most important case, known as Dole v. Dow, the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, allowed so-called third-party suits against employers. Under the decision, a maker of defective equipment who is required to pay damages to an injured worker can in turn sue the worker's employer to collect part of those damages.
Business groups contend that the Dole v. Dow decision has led to expensive and protracted litigation between companies. Mr. Pataki said that third-party lawsuits account for about 6 percent, or $300 million, of the $5 billion in premiums paid by state businesses each year.
In what is likely to be the most hotly contested part of his plan, Mr. Pataki calls for repealing the Dole decision. Almost all other states prohibit such lawsuits, and Mr. Pataki contends that New York will be hurt in the competition for new companies if it does not bar them as well.
But union leaders contend that repealing the Dole decision would remove an important incentive for employers to keep their workplaces safe. "We're talking about billions stolen in this system," Mr. Cleary said. "They are trying to slough it off on Dole v. Dow? That's too simple."
Aides to the Governor said a major savings in his plan was a proposal to limit judges' discretion in deciding an injured worker's benefits. Under the Pataki plan, judges would have to use guidelines established by the American Medical Association.

HEADLINE: New Boat People Exodus: Back to Vietnam

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, April 16

 BODY:
Two decades after the fall of Saigon, the biggest flood of Vietnamese boat people in years is under way. But this time the flow is being reversed, as refugee camps around Southeast Asia begin closing down and tens of thousands of asylum-seekers are sent back to the country they fled.
In an effort to be done with this last chapter of the Vietnam War, the United Nations agreed at an international meeting last month to cut off financing for the camps on June 30. The people who remain in the camps are no longer considered eligible for resettlement, and officials say the only option for the Vietnamese now is to go home -- willingly or not. 
 This week officials here plan to march as many as 500 holdouts onto a ship and send them back across the South China Sea. It would be the largest single group yet to be sent home and the first to be returned by sea.
Vietnam, while still Communist, has changed, refugee officials say, and the last 35,000 people in camps around the region are not true refugees fleeing repression but "economic migrants" who do not have a claim to resettlement in the West.
"We have tried to make it very clear to them: there is no more hope," said Rear Adm. Yaacob bin H. J. Daud, the director of the Malaysian Government task force on refugees. "They cannot extend this thing anymore."
It may still be many months before the camps are empty, but with the cutoff in international financing, conditions in the camps will become increasingly harsh.
In Vietnam, the Government is preparing to receive, process and resettle a flood of reluctant returnees, many of them hostile or broken in spirit, many without homes or jobs to return to.
"The last ones will be the most difficult," said Nghiem Xuan Tue, who oversees the return of refugees for the Vietnamese Ministry of Labor. "We will try our hardest. The most important thing is for their local community to welcome them as long-lost relatives who have come home."
He said Vietnam had streamlined its procedures for processing the returnees and was prepared to receive as many as 3,600 a month, straining its bureaucracy and social services.
"It will be a monumental undertaking," said Court Robinson, an American consultant to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "This population has been in the camps for seven years now, and if we know anything about reintegration it becomes more difficult the longer one has been away -- and even more difficult when one is really dead set against coming back."
As the return of the first boat, scheduled for Thursday, approached, Erika Feller, the United Nations refugee representative in Kuala Lumpur, voiced a worry shared by officials around the region: "We hope it does not boil down to the model that you have seen in Hong Kong, where protesting refugees are carried horizontally onto airplanes."
The longer that people have remained in the camps, the more desperate their fears have become. There have been riots in camps in Malaysia and the Philippines. The police have used tear gas and batons to battle protesters in Hong Kong. In Indonesia two years ago refugees set themselves on fire to protest plans to send them home.
 
Camps Are Closed To All Visitors
"We need help here!" one man called out to reporters as Philippine officials prepared to send a planeload of refugees back to Vietnam in February. "Help! Help!"
And another said: "We won't be safe in Vietnam. We're scared."
Here in Malaysia, in Thailand, the Philippines and elsewhere, officials have closed the camps to visitors as they lobby intensely to persuade the refugees to leave without a struggle.
"We are talking to them," Admiral Yaacob said. "We have gone deep into their hearts to tell them: 'This is the time to go. If you keep delaying, it will only get worse.' "
Since the Communist takeover of Saigon in 1975, more than 800,000 Vietnamese have passed through the camps in Southeast Asia, most on their way to resettlement in the United States, Canada, France, Australia and other "third countries."
To the consternation of those countries, the flood of boat people continued through the decades, and in 1989 a screening system was set up under which the West would accept only true refugees. Some 115,000 people were deemed to be economic migrants and were refused resettlement. As of this month, about 77,000 of these had been sent home by plane.
That policy has helped bring a virtual halt to boat departures from Vietnam. Since 1989 most refugees have left by plane under the Orderly Departure Program.
About half the remaining holdouts are in camps in Hong Kong, and officials there are counting on the persuasive power of an unusual local deadline: June 30, 1997. On that date the British colony is to be handed over to the Chinese, who have demanded that the camps there be empty when they take control.
The United States is also pressing Hanoi to accept a "Track II" policy in which returnees will be allowed a final interview with American officials once they are back in Vietnam. Such a policy would add one more incentive to return and would address concerns in Washington that some refugees have been unfairly denied asylum.
In a carefully worded statement last month, the Vietnamese Government suggested that such interviews might be possible within the framework of the Orderly Departure Program, a statement that one Western diplomat called "highly significant."
Vietnamese officials are concerned that "Track II" could complicate the already delicate task of resettling reluctant returnees. "It is very dangerous, very dangerous to give them hope that they can still go to America," Mr. Tue said. "Instead of settling in, they will spend the day gathered in front of the United States Embassy asking for visas and creating disorder."
The fate of the returning refugees is a delicate issue that has caused alarm among Vietnamese emigre groups as well as panic among the people who remain in the camps. But United Nations officials insist they are tracking the returns closely and have found no cases of political persecution by the Government.
Catherine Bertrand, the United Nations refugee agency's representative in Hanoi, said a team of seven foreign monitoring officers, all fluent in Vietnamese, had interviewed 23,000 returnees since 1989. "We are witnesses that these people have returned to Vietnam and have not been persecuted for leaving illegally," she said.
Returning refugees receive cash assistance and loans from the United Nations and the European Union, and their home communities receive help for local construction projects that is intended to cushion any resentment against the new arrivals.
 
Not All Succeed In Restarting Lives
Though most returnees have managed to restart their lives with the help of their families and communities, Mr. Tue said: "There are 25 to 30 percent who are not stable. They keep thinking about leaving again. Some are lazy. And some who left here with criminal records must now face justice."
There are many kinds of problems, Mr. Robinson said, including delays in receiving reintegration help, problems with community members, problems with local party officials and "the inevitable corruption."
"Not everybody will hit the ground running and say, 'Where's my cash grant; I'm off to start a business,' " he said. "There's going to be a lot of decompressing, a lot of depression. Many of them will just veg out."
Nguyen Minh Quan, a 39-year-old mechanic, spent nearly seven years in a refugee camp in Hong Kong with his wife and two children before giving up and returning to Hanoi last November.
When a Vietnamese-speaking United Nations monitor named Dirk Hebecker visited him last month, he made no pretense about being a political refugee. "Things were hard here back then," he said of his departure in 1988. "We were looking for a better life."
 
Counting the Cost Of a Perilous Trip
Like other returnees visited on this day by Mr. Hebecker, Mr. Quan had not found a job and was living with relatives. In a long and relaxed conversation, he volunteered that he had had no difficulties with local officials.
He said he had received a $960 resettlement allowance from the United Nations for his family of four and $550 from the Hong Kong authorities as an incentive to volunteer to return.
"That's not peanuts in this country," Ms. Bertrand said in describing grants that can add up to well over a year's pay. "It gives them the means to find another job or help them start to build a house or buy a field or start a small business." But like many other refugees, Mr. Quan said he had used the money not to begin a new life but to survive.
People like Mr. Quan and his family gained little from their aspirations for a better life. The perilous boat journeys, the wasted years in a refugee camp and the hardships of their return have left them mostly worse off than they were before.
Those who remain in the camps today may face an even rougher final chapter, Mr. Robinson said.
"The picture of people being dragged crying and screaming to airplanes may become not the occasional exception but the norm," he said. "These are people who are essentially innocent of any crime. No matter what we feel about their status -- no matter whether they are actually refugees or not -- that is still very sad."

HEADLINE: U.S. MILITARY ROLE IN EAST ASIA GETS SUPPORT IN TOKYO

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, April 17

 BODY:
Defying anti-American sentiment fanned by the rape of an Okinawa girl by American servicemen last fall, President Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan today reaffirmed the United States' military presence in the Far East as "essential for preserving peace and stability" in the region.
In a joint declaration signed by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hashimoto at a midday ceremony, the two leaders proclaimed that the security relationship between America and Japan "remains the cornerstone for achieving common security objectives and maintaining a stable and prosperous environment" in Asia. 
 The declaration states that the United States has determined that it will need to maintain its current force structure of 100,000 troops in the region, "including about the current level in Japan." Anthony Lake, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, said Mr. Hashimoto's signature would signal Japan's endorsement of the American position.
"The relationship between the United States and Japan is better and stronger than ever,"' Mr. Clinton said after the signing. "Our security alliance is key to maintaining a Pacific at peace."
The declaration also incorporates the plan struck by the United States and Japan on the eve of Mr. Clinton's state visit, to return an air base, two communications centers, a port and other military properties on Okinawa, where the rape provoked huge protests against the United States military presence.
Annoyance at the American military bases lingers, as shown by a rally by thousands in Tokyo Tuesday, during which the United States was branded an "illegal occupant" of Japanese territory. Such sentiment is even stronger in Okinawa, where most people want all American bases closed eventually.
The document opens the door for Japan to consider broader ways of cooperating with the United States during a war in East Asia, with the two nations agreeing to review 1978 guidelines for military cooperation. American officials have called the review a potential breakthrough since Japan has held that its Constitution would prohibit any involvement in such a military operation.
The signing of the declaration is the centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's two-day state visit to Japan, intended to reaffirm that the United States has a major security role to play in Asia even after the cold war and to showcase Mr. Clinton's prestige as a foreign-policy maker.
This morning, before his session with Mr. Hashimoto, Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, were welcomed at the Akasaka Palace, the official state quest house modeled after Versailles, by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. With the two men in front and the women walking behind, the Clintons were then escorted to a limousine waiting to take them to the Imperial Palace.
Mr. Clinton's trip has also underscored some of the foibles of political timing. Mr. Clinton was originally supposed to make his visit in November but canceled because of the confrontation with Congress over the budget. Japan now has a new Prime Minister more attuned to America's view of regional security. And China's recent military exercises in the Taiwan Strait as well as North Korea's incursions into the demilitarized zone separating it from South Korea have raised new fears throughout the region and a new focus on military policy.
Trade issues -- a usual flashpoint between America and Japan -- were barely on the agenda. Laura Tyson, Mr. Clinton's economic adviser, said she expected no breakthroughs in three areas of contention: semiconductors, photographic film and insurance. Over the weekend, American and Japanese negotiators abandoned efforts to reach an insurance accord before the President's visit.
Arguing that Japan's shrinking trade surplus and the growth of American exports demonstrate a marked increase in access to Japan's markets, Clitnon Administration officials have worked hard to promote their record of forging trade agreements with Japan. But the American Ambassador, Walter Mondale, was blunter this morning, telling reporters, "Japan continues to be too closed, over regulated, too resistant to market forces and I think that will be true for a long time."
Mr. Clinton arrived here on Tuesday after a stop in South Korea, where he and President Kim Young Sam proposed four-party talks -- including the two Koreas, China and the United States -- intended to replace with a permanent peace agreement the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War.
Before he leaves Japan on Thursday evening Mr. Clinton plans to address Parliament and visit a Chrysler branch to showcase his efforts to open Japanese markets to American autos and auto parts.
A key component of the security declaration is the American decision to hand back 20 percent of its holdings on Okinawa in the coming years. The functions and personnel of the bases that are closing are to be transfered to bases in other Japanese towns so that the number of American troops remains 47,000.
Japan has agreed to pay virtually all of the costs of the base closings and transfer of American personnel. And the security declaration also incorporates an agreement for Japan and the United States to share food, transportation, refueling, medical care and weapons parts during peacetime, bringing Japan's self-defense forces into greater partnership with the American military.

HEADLINE: Hanoi Journal;
A Vietnamese Uprising, to Keep Out High-Rises

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam

 BODY:
Battered by war, crumbling from poverty and neglect, this faded, tree-lined capital remains one of the last beautiful cities in Asia, a relic of French colonial elegance surrounded by the raucous new mega-cities of the region's economic boom.
Now Vietnam has begun to develop, and just a year or two ago local planners and foreign architects were voicing despair that Hanoi, with a population of more than two million, was about to go the way of Bangkok, Singapore, Jakarta and Shanghai -- bustling, new and increasingly indistinguishable. 
 High-rise developers had demolished the colonnaded shopping arcade by the edge of Hoan Kiem Lake, at the city's heart. They had begun to rip down the historic prison known to Americans as the Hanoi Hilton. And the drawing boards were filled with projects that threatened the narrow streets of its 1,000-year-old Ancient Quarter and the shaded villas of its French section.
But today those same projects have been scaled back or halted, and city officials are increasingly saying no to ambitious proposals that would make a lot of money very fast. They have established a Chief Architect's office and published a new urban plan, and they are directing high-rise developers toward the city's western district, where they have set virtually no limits on growth.
The planners and architects who watch over Hanoi now say this could be the first major city in the region to modernize without losing its character and its low-rise charm.
"We have a new policy," said Ha Van Que, the assistant to the city's Chief Architect. "We are trying to preserve our city and develop it at the same time."
This approach appears to be part of an urgent effort by the Government to control the potentially chaotic development it has unleashed in the 1990's with new market-oriented policies. The Government is working to disperse new industries around the country and to avoid the urban concentrations that have brought problems elsewhere in Asia.
"We think we're getting somewhere," said Lawrie Wilson, an Australian urban planner who is an adviser to the Chief Architect. "I'm quite optimistic that what is left remaining today of the character of the city will be conserved and enhanced."
Mr. Wilson said the question as Vietnam suddenly opened its economy to rapid development was: Is it possible to modernize without becoming Bangkok?
He called that city a case study in the ruinous effects of rapid, chaotic development, with its congestion and traffic jams, its pollution, its squatter colonies, its overburdened services and the loss of its character.
"There is no model where you can say, yes, it can be done," he said. "It hasn't been done."
But Hanoi has the advantage of starting 20 or 30 years late. It has been preserved from development by the hardships of war and poverty, and it has the opportunity now to learn from its neighbors.
"We want to avoid the mistakes of Bangkok and other cities in Southeast Asia," Mr. Que said. "They developed too quickly."
Hanoi also has the benefit of the strict planning and tight controls of the country's Communist Government. The word of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet -- who appears from his speeches to be a dedicated urban conservationist -- carries the power of fiat.
"There are decrees that say the character of the Ancient Quarter and the French quarter must be preserved," Mr. Wilson said. "No other city has had that. In other cities it was just 'we must develop and the sky's the limit.' "
For a time, it was argued here that the graceful avenues of the French section were a vestige of colonialism that should be demolished, as happened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. But the Vietnamese seem now to have embraced this heritage, taking Yangon, the still-undeveloped capital of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, as a model of low-rise, colonial-style beauty.
Part of their motivation is economic, Mr. Que said. There is an understanding that tourism can be a big money-earner if Hanoi preserves its distinct character. But some conservationists say a more basic motive is also involved -- a sentimental attachment to a beautiful place.
The fight for the city's character has not yet been won, though. Widespread corruption and the quicksand of Vietnam's bureaucracy can swallow Government decrees.
And there remains a strong lobby for rapid, unfettered growth. There are many people here, after decades of lagging behind other nations, who want nothing more than to look like Bangkok.
"I don't like these ugly old houses," said Nguyen Thanh Thuy, a dressmaker who lives in the clamorous, winding lanes of the city's Ancient Quarter, where the streets are named for the artisans who once populated them, Shoe Street, Gold Street, Fan Street, Basket Street.
The Ancient Quarter is home to a fascinating form of architecture, low, narrow buildings called tube houses that have lengthened over decades or centuries as new generations have added to them. But they have become overcrowded and unsanitary and there is nothing many residents wish more than to knock the old dwellings down.
"I like beautiful tall, tall buildings," Miss Thuy said, taking a deep breath. "Tall, tall is beautiful, beautiful. The people who live here want to live in tall new buildings."
Development is taking a different path in Ho Chi Minh City -- as bustling now as during the wartime years when it was named Saigon. In that city, there is a sense that the battle for conservation was already lost in the 1960's, when the war economy fueled a frenzy of new construction.
But it is also a less fragile city than Hanoi, with broad thoroughfares that may be able to support the architectural power of high-rise construction. And planners there are working to avoid the congestion of Bangkok by directing new development to the suburbs.
In Hanoi, the first rounds went to the developers, who rushed in before the Government had a framework for assessing their dazzling proposals. Before anyone really understood what they were doing, they had knocked down the two-story shopping arcade by Hoan Kiem Lake and prepared to put up twin 20-story apartment towers -- 14 stories taller than any other building in the city.
"It's called progress," Peter Purcell, the project's Australian developer, said at the time.
But his towers will not now be built. The newly created City Architect's office stepped in, and Mr. Que said the project's design has now been limited to a five-story building by the side of the lake with an eight-story annex in the back "That's all," he said.
The arcade's colonnaded facade is to be restored.
"There is a learning curve going on," said Leigh Scott-Kemmins, a founding director of Friends of Hanoi, a nonprofit Australian-backed group that lobbies for architectural conservation.
"It was not until some dreadful mistakes were made, horrible things growing up out of the ground, that they started to panic," he said. "They kept talking about losing their culture -- not just the architecture but the soul of the city. There was a concern that they had fought long and hard for this place and they didn't want it to slip away before their eyes."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips on U.S. Stock Selloff And Doubts on German Rate Cut

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday, weakened by new uncertainty over the German interest-rate outlook, a selloff in the United States stock market and a surge in demand for Mexican pesos.
Traders said the volume of foreign-exchange dealings was thin ahead of a regularly scheduled meeting of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, thus exaggerating the movement of currency values. 
 In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5060 German marks, from 1.5089 Tuesday, and was lower against most other European currencies. The British pound rose to $1.5095, from $1.5077. The dollar traded at 108.20 Japanese yen, up slightly from 108.15 yen. .
"Everyone is waiting to see what the Bundesbank does," said Richard Vullo, vice president at the New York offices of Hypo Bank, a German bank.
Speculation has intensified in recent weeks that Germany's central bankers will have to ease interest rates to stimulate the country's anemic economy. A rate cut would diminish demand for marks and indirectly bolster the dollar's value. The expectation of a rate reduction has been an important underpinning in the dollar's recent strength.
But some currency traders were increasingly skeptical that the Bundesbank would ease rates today. They said Germany's central bankers were probably more worried about a large expansion in Germany's money supply. "There's no pressure for them to ease right away," Mr Vullo said. "They'd rather be cautious and wait."
Others said that it was only a matter of time before the Bundesbank cut rates, if not today than in the next few months.
A retreat in the American stock market after three days of gains also may have contributed to the dollar's weakness. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.09 points and most other market indexes fell.
Added pressure on the dollar came from Mexico, where demand for pesos surged on word the Government was issuing as much as $2.5 billion in new bonds in a debt refinancing managed by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The refinancing was seen as a strong sign of Mexico's recovery, and investors sold dollars and bought pesos to buy the new securities. It took 7.428 pesos to buy a dollar yesterday, down from 7.430 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The drive to put cost limits on regulatory benefits isn't dead yet.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
REGULATORY reform, shorthand for the Republican push to require regulators to take account of economic costs as well as benefits in rule-making, crashed and burned in the Senate last summer. But there is a glimmer of hope that a coalition of Republicans and moderate Democrats can fashion a compromise -- reform lite, if you will -- before it is hopelessly mired in election year politicking.
Much depends on the willingness of Democrats to sacrifice what has become a dandy partisan issue. Even more turns on the resourcefulness of Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader and the Republican choice to challenge President Clinton, who has very good reasons at the moment to demonstrate his ideological flexibility. 
 What a difference a year makes. With conservative Republicans riding high, Mr. Dole led the charge for sweeping changes that would have required Federal agencies to show that the benefits of all regulations exceeded the costs.
As an abstraction the concept is unassailable. By definition, rules that exact costs in excess of benefits are bad rules. Besides, Robert Stavins, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, notes that even where the law prohibits consideration of costs in pursuit of mandated goals -- the Clean Air Act, for example -- regulators never truly ignored them. "Surely it would be better," he argues, "to consider costs in the front room rather than the back room."
But some benefits are very difficult to quantify. It is hard to say, for example, how much it is worth to make post offices accessible to wheelchairs, or how much Americans would lose if pollutants from distant power plants reduced visibility on the rim of the Grand Canyon to 20 miles from 100 miles. Relying on the courts as the arbiter would, at very least, be cumbersome. "It would amount to a full employment act for regulatory lawyers," says Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.
Democrats charged that the Dole bill was an invitation to nullify a quarter-century of health, safety and environmental rules and to tie up new regulatory initiatives indefinitely. They frightened enough fence-sitting senators to make it impossible to stop a filibuster, effectively killing the bill before Mr. Clinton got to veto it. Indeed, polls suggest that the bill was a disaster for the Republicans in general and Bob Dole in particular, tarring them as lackeys of business interests.
But regulatory change is not quite dead. For one thing, policy wonks from both parties are still beating the drums for it. Last week, a who's who of mainstream economists ranging from the Nobel laureate Kenneth J. Arrow to Richard L. Schmalensee of M.I.T., who was an adviser on regulation to President George Bush, published a statement in Science magazine defending the role of cost-benefit analysis in Government rule-making. And today, the Center for Innovation and the Environment, a nonpartisan arm of the influential Democratic Leadership Council, plans to call for a "second generation of environmental protection" -- one that faces up to the costs of greening America.
More important, the politics of regulation remains volatile. Mr. Dole needs to find a way back to the middle if he is to win the support of the mineral water and granola crowd in the suburbs. Meanwhile, centrist Democrats, including Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, understand that last summer's triumphant rejection of change could become this summer's failure to save factory jobs in the swing states of the Midwest. He argues that for the moment, environmentalists have a chance to negotiate from a position of strength, compromising to "get the issue behind us."
Mr. Levin fashioned a kinder, gentler alternative to the Dole bill that would mandate cost-benefit analysis, yet give the executive branch considerable leeway to use other criteria in judging proposed rules. And while he notes that "it was unacceptable to business, environmental groups and the White House," the political risks of delay could still drive the parties to the bargaining table.
Mr. Stavins of Harvard, one of the signers of the Science magazine statement, would like to see a compromise that forces the agencies to weigh costs against benefits and explain themselves if, in the end, they choose to override the policy dictated by the numbers. That way, the political risks in ignoring costs would increase. At very least the public would learn whether it cost, say, 21 cents or $21,000 for each visit by a wheelchair-bound American to the post office.
What is most frustrating in this debate is that the stalemate serves hardly anyone's interest. Mr. Hahn argues that "we have the technical know-how" to refine rule-making, clarifying the facts undermining rational debate over issues ranging from asbestos to airline safety. Still lacking, apparently, is faith among competing interests that more information is better than less.

Mexico Set to Issue New 30-Year Bonds

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 17

 BODY:
Mexico said today that it was issuing up to $2.5 billion of new bonds that it would swap for United States-backed Brady bonds in a sign that the country's status had improved in financial markets.
The news immediately sent Mexican bond prices and the peso higher as investors scrambled to get in position to buy the new securities. 
 Mexico plans to issue between $1 billion and $2.5 billion worth of the 30-year dollar-denominated bonds, said Goldman, Sachs & Company, the lead manager of the offer.
The offer, which expires on April 30 unless Mexico extends it, is meant to let Mexico achieve longer terms and lower interest rates on its debt, as well as eliminate a need to keep collateral on hand to repay the loans.
"This operation emphasizes that the perception of Mexico in the international markets is changing," said Jose Luis Gomez Pimienta, director of the Mexico Fund Inc., an investment group.
Standard & Poor's gave the new bonds a junk-bond rating of BB, the same currently assigned to the Brady bonds.
The Brady bonds lost much of their value in late 1994 and early 1995, in large part because of Mexico's economic crisis.
The Brady bonds are named for the former Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, who developed a plan to overhaul Latin American debt. Repayment of the principal on Brady bonds is backed by United States Treasury bonds owned by the issuing country and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Coca-Cola's First-Quarter Net Rose 12% on 9% Revenue Gain

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 17

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company reported a 12 percent increase in first-quarter earnings today, but sluggish sales increases in Latin America and Africa continued to be a drag on its international profits.
The company also said that it had repurchased about four million shares during the quarter and that shareholders had approved a 2-for-1 stock split. 
The world's largest soft drink company said net income rose to $713 million, or 57 cents a share, from $638 million, or 50 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1995. The latest earnings matched the average forecast of 15 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 9 percent, to $4.19 billion from $3.85 billion.
Coca-Cola's share price fell $1.25, to $80.125, in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.
Total beverage shipments rose 7 percent in the first quarter. The size of the increase met expectations and was smaller than the 9 percent gain in last year's first quarter.
Sales in Latin America, one of the company's biggest markets, rose only 2 percent, below Coca-Cola's forecast of an increase of between 3 percent and 4 percent and well below the 16 percent increase of a year earlier. Growth was hurt by sagging economies in some of the region's biggest markets.
In Mexico, the world's second-largest consumer of soft drinks, Coca-Cola's case sales fell 2 percent.
Results should improve by the second half of the year as Mexico, as well as Argentina, pulls out of recession and as the company continues to increase growth in developed countries, analysts said.
Overall sales growth in the first quarter was fueled by business in the United States, the world's largest soft drink consumer, where unit sales rose 8 percent. Sales growth in Europe, the Middle East and Asia exceeded levels a year earlier, with some countries, including China and India, registering gains of more than 40 percent.
In Africa, though, sales rose only 1 percent, compared with a 12 percent gain a year earlier. The company had forecast sales growth of 1 percent.
Coca-Cola noted that the dollar had risen 7 percent against some key foreign currencies over the last 12 months. As the dollar strengthens, sales denominated in other currencies yield fewer dollars.
The company said it lost $7 million from its holdings in bottlers in the quarter, compared with profit of $24 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Drop On Treasuries For a 2d Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped for a second straight day yesterday, despite a Government report that housing starts fell 3.9 percent last month. Much like the weak manufacturing report earlier this week, it failed to ease investor concern that the economy might be poised for an inflationary rebound.
The 30-year bond fell 7/32, to a price of 89 24/32 to yield 6.81 percent, up from 6.79 percent on Tuesday. 
 Traders report that the market is requiring more assurances that the economy will not rebound too strongly. Even though oil and commodity prices have subsided somewhat, investors would like to see further declines before buying. The Commodity Research Bureau index, after falling more than a point yesterday on top of the huge three-point slide on Tuesday, closed up 0.60 point, at 256.44.
According to the Commerce Department, housing starts ran last month at an annualized pace of 1.447 million homes, less than the 1.467 million expected by economists polled by Bloomberg Business News.
The issue of securities supply also raised market concerns as the Treasury Department announced the details of its April 23 and 24 sales of new two- and five-year notes, raising the volume of each maturity by $500 million, to $18.75 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. In when-issued trading ahead of the sales, the two-year issue was being offered at a price to yield 5.99 percent and the five-year at a price to yield 6.34 percent.
Kenneth J. Kaplan, portfolio manager, at Spare, Kaplan, Bischel & Associates, a San Francisco-based money management firm, attributed the current weakness in the bond market to a widespread overoptimism that inflation was under control and the Fed would cut interest rates.
"There is still a lot of speculation in the bond market," Mr. Kaplan said, "but now for the first time people are talking about a tightening. So there is a psychological change taking part in the market."
Mr. Kaplan does not foresee a return to the double-digit inflation of the late 70's and early 80's, "but it will be higher than it has been over the last couple of years," he said.
"Currently anything that knocks the market off its optimistic views is punished with a disproportionate negative reaction," Mr. Kaplan said. "We think rates could get above 7 percent, but basically you still have to feel that bonds are more attractive today than they were at the beginning of the year."
Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at IDEA, a British financial consulting firm, said the big issue over the next week would be "the absorption of the two- and five-year notes and one-year bills, with dealers well aware the May quarterly refunding will quickly follow."
"This will happen in an environment where concerns have grown that the Fed may tighten by autumn despite an election year," he said. The Fed, he recalled, tightened aggressively during the 1988 campaign.
Mr. Stiles said the rise in long-term interest rates would act as a natural brake on growth, but with a considerable lag.
A Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, speaking to members of the National Association of Business Economists in Washington, said yesterday that he saw slow-to-moderate growth without accelerating inflation. His views contrast with many in the market, who expect the economy to overheat and produce inflation.

Economies of Europe Eroding Amid Gains Elsewhere

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
While the United States remains on a path of stable if moderate growth, the condition of the big West European economies has significantly deteriorated over the last six months. And Japan is showing increasing signs of strength, the International Monetary Fund reported today.
Developing nations continue to post growth rates about three times as high as industrial nations, with the strongest growth still in Asia, the fund said in its twice-yearly assessment of the world's economies. 
 Inflation remains low in the industrial world, and is falling rapidly in the third world, the I.M.F. said. And with global financial markets exerting strong discipline, nations everywhere are adopting stricter policies to reduce budget deficits.
Indeed, although its forecasts for the full year reflect the difficulties now being encountered by European nations in particular, the I.M.F. said that by the second half of this year, growth in many nations should begin accelerating.
"We believe the slowdown is largely behind us and that a pickup in the rate of economic expansion should become visible going forward," Michael Mussa, the fund's director of economic research, said at a news conference here.
The report was issued at the start of a weeklong meeting of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, at which representatives of most nations will discuss economic and development issues.
The fund predicted that the American economy would grow 1.8 percent this year, slightly below the consensus of around 2 percent. It said Japan would grow 2.7 percent, three times its rate last year. Among other major trading partners of the United States, Mexico is forecast to grow 3 percent after shrinking 6.9 percent last year, and Canada is projected to grow 1.9 percent, down slightly from last year.
The health of other economies is important to the United States because weakness among big trading partners brings a decline in American exports. Mexico's economic woes last year led to a big deficit for the United States in its trade with Mexico. A revival in Japan is good news for American exports, although the renewed strength of the dollar against the yen is likely to diminish the price competitiveness of American goods in Japan.
The most severe downturn in outlook among the biggest economies was in Germany, Europe's industrial powerhouse and the linchpin of efforts to forge a single European currency and monetary policy. The fund cut its estimate of German growth this year to 1 percent, down from its estimate last October of 2.9 percent growth for 1996.
Germany's currency is strong, relative to those of some other European nations. And upward pressure on wages has hurt the investment climate in Germany, and consumer confidence has sagged as unemployment has risen above 11 percent.
France, which is being battered by many of the same forces afflicting Germany, will grow only 1.3 percent this year, the fund said. In October, it was predicting 1996 growth of 2.7 percent. For the 15-member European Union as a whole, the I.M.F. projected that 1996 growth would be 1.8 percent, down from its projection in October of 2.8 percent.
The fund put particular weight in its analysis on attempts by governments to keep their deficits under control. "Budgetary problems are a threat to durable and satisfactory growth performance in almost all industrial nations," it said. "The risk of slippages in consolidation efforts is all the more disquieting since the fiscal burden of public health and pension systems as presently structured is projected to increase considerably throughout most of the industrial world in the coming decades."

HEADLINE: Housing Construction At Slower Pace in March

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Housing construction slowed in March, partly because of a sharp drop in new apartments, as rising mortgage rates threatened to weaken the housing market in coming months.
"Builders are continuing to build," said David Lereah, an economist at the Mortgage Builders Association. "But I get nervous going forward. Eventually, interest rates will win this war" if they continue to rise and price buyers out of the market. 
 So far, however, higher mortgage rates have not yet depressed the housing market seriously. Although now at a 10-month high, rates are still at relatively affordable levels. That has resulted in healthy sales of new and existing homes recently.
David Berson, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, said an expanding economy, including modest job and income growth, was offsetting some of the impact of higher financing costs.
Some analysts also say fears of even higher rates are driving some buyers into the housing market.
Housing starts fell 3.9 percent in March, to a seasonally adjusted 1.45 million annual rate, the Commerce Department reported today. It was the steepest decline since starts fell 6.2 percent a year earlier.
But activity was mixed regionally, rising in the Northeast and Midwest while falling in the South and West.
Single-family starts, which are interest-sensitive and represent about 80 percent of residential building activity, slipped 1.4 percent, to a 1.16 million rate. But construction of apartments and condominiums, an often volatile category not as subject to interest-rate changes, plunged 12.7 percent, to a 288,000 rate.
Despite the overall decline, housing starts remained above 1.4 million for a fifth straight month. And the February rate was even stronger than initially estimated -- 1.51 million rather than 1.49 million.
Joe Blalock, an economist at America's Community Bankers, said the housing starts rate in the first quarter -- "typically not one of the stronger quarters" -- averaged 1.47 million, higher than the 1.46 million single-family homes and apartments built in 1994. Starts dipped to 1.35 million last year.
But many analysts believe the housing market is reaching a plateau.
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.68 percent in March, up from 7.17 percent in February and 7.03 percent in January. They have continued to climb and averaged 8.05 percent last week, highest since 8.27 percent in May 1995. The monthly payment on a $100,000 mortgage with a 7 percent interest rate is $665, while the payment on the same loan with a 8 percent rate is $734 -- an increase of $69.
"I don't think rates will keep going up," Fannie Mae's Mr. Berson said. "But on the other hand, I don't think the strong housing market will continue. It will get modestly weaker. There's not much pent-up demand left" as the economy enters its sixth year of expansion.
Analysts said the number of applications for building permits also suggested new construction might be leveling off. They inched up a barely perceptible one-tenth of 1 percent, to a 1.41 million rate.
Regionally, housing starts shot up 10.2 percent in the Northeast to a 140,000 rate, highest since 169,000 in November 1994. Cheryl Katz, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said the surge most likely was a rebound from weather-depressed levels in December and January.
Starts rose 3.5 percent in the Midwest, to 322,000. But they sank 16.1 percent in the West, to a 349,000 rate, the biggest drop since falling 20.7 percent in March 1995. And they slipped 2.3 percent in the South, to 636,000.

HEADLINE: And They All Came Tumbling Down;
Short-Seller Levels a Wall St. Institution

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
For years, the promoters of small public companies have complained about "bear raids" by short-sellers, investors who strive to profit from declining stock prices. But despite tales of bears who go even further, illegally conspiring to drive prices down, actual evidence of such misbehavior has been scarce.
That may be about to change. According to a letter and an affidavit filed with a bankruptcy judge in Manhattan, Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation of whether illegal short-selling on a huge scale caused the collapse of two Wall Street firms last year. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the enforcement unit of the National Association of Securities Dealers are also examining whether the short-selling violated market rules, the documents submitted to the court show. 
 These inquiries all focus on the collapse in February 1995 of Hanover Sterling & Company, a penny-stock firm, and the consequent failure of the Adler, Coleman Clearing Corporation, a firm that guaranteed and processed trades for Hanover and 41 other small retail brokers. The assets of Adler, Coleman are now being liquidated in bankruptcy court.
Firms like Hanover Sterling that deal in inexpensive and typically unseasoned securities known as penny stocks collapse with dreary regularity. The unexpected collapse of Adler, Coleman, however, strained the Wall Street safety net: Adler is the first major clearing firm to fail in the 25-year history of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, the industry-financed agency that insures brokerage customer accounts. With some 66,000 accounts affected, it is one of the largest liquidation cases the SIPC has ever faced, and the fund's potential losses run as high as $40 million.
The case is crucial to the small but important community of professional short-sellers. Though almost always controversial, many of these investors buttress their skeptical attitude with thorough research; their contrary trades often provide a check on the hyperbole and euphoria of the marketplace.
Only a few small brokerage firms in the short-selling community are involved in the Adler case. Those short-sellers have denied any misbehavior and have, in fact, gone into bankruptcy court to accuse the trustee unwinding the mess for SIPC -- Edwin Mishkin, a partner in the law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton -- of improperly shifting SIPC's losses onto their backs. If their challenge fails, the risks of being contrarian may rise. And if any of them are later found to have committed a crime, the pressure to curb all short selling may intensify.
Luckily for the future law students who will have to study this complicated case in years to come, the players in the Adler, Coleman bankruptcy are fighting over these critical issues with all the decorum of the folks who organized the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.
In a deposition, John Fiero, owner of Fiero Brothers Inc., one of the short-sellers challenging the trustee, recalled threats he said he had received from the officers of Hanover before it collapsed. John T. Moran, who pleaded guilty in 1991 to securities fraud but who was nevertheless an adviser to Hanover in its final days, testified that he was offered a bribe to withhold his testimony from Mr. Mishkin. And, Mr. Mishkin said, the officers of Adler, Coleman had received anonymous warnings against cooperating with his efforts to liquidate the firm's estate.
For their part, in legal complaints filed in the bankruptcy case, the short-sellers have accused Mr. Mishkin of securities fraud for his handling of the estate. And Mr. Mishkin has responded with a blistering counterclaim that accuses the short-sellers of using "unlawful and criminal acts of extortion, economic coercion, threats of physical violence and destruction of business" and various other means to deliberately kill Hanover and Adler.
The criminal investigation detailed in the court documents was discussed this week by lawyers at a hearing before the bankruptcy judge, James L. Garrity Jr., who is handling the Adler case. At the hearing, lawyers for short-sellers had asked the judge to order that information gathered in the bankruptcy case not be shared with Federal investigators or market regulators. After the judge balked, they withdrew the request.
Eric Hershmann, a lawyer for Fiero Brothers, said yesterday that he had had no direct contact with law enforcement. He said, however, that he was convinced that there was a continuing investigation of the events that had caused the collapse of Hanover Sterling. "Is Fiero probably one of the parties being investigated? Yes," he said. "Do I think there are numerous others? Yes."
But, he said, "our client has done nothing whatsoever wrong to warrant those investigations."
The seeds of the case were planted late in 1994, when prices were soaring for Hanover's "house stocks," shares of the flimsy companies the firm aggressively marketed to retail customers. Regulators have already charged that at least one of the stocks -- All-Pro Products Inc., founded by Lawrence Taylor, the former football star -- was illegally manipulated by Hanover. Then the bears started to sell those shares short in huge amounts.
Anyone who thinks a stock is headed for a fall can bet on that prospect by selling short. To legally effect a short sale, an investor arranges to borrow stock from a securities firm and sells it in hopes that the price will fall substantially before he has to "cover his position" -- that is, buy shares to replace those he borrowed. If he bets correctly, his profit will be the difference between the price he sold the shares for and the amount he spent to cover.
But the stock may rise in price or the shares may be difficult to find in the market when it is time to cover. If the short-seller cannot make good on his promise to return the shares he borrowed, the person owed the shares conducts what is called a "buy-in," which entails buying the shares elsewhere and charging the short-seller whatever that costs.
As the short sales grew on its house stocks, Hanover did not drop the price it was willing to pay for the shares on the open market -- perhaps because that would have reduced the value of its own inventory of those stocks and put it out of business. Instead, it kept buying until its capital was exhausted.
When Hanover failed, its customer accounts became the obligation of Adler, Coleman, one of the more venerable clearing firms on the Street.
The world of clearing firms is a mystery to most investors. Indeed, the largest securities firms clear for themselves and their customers are not even aware of how crucial clearing brokers are to the machinery of the market. A clearing broker, sometimes called "a broker's broker," guarantees the trades entered into by its client firms, who are called "introducing brokers." If an introducing broker cannot immediately meet its obligations, its clearing firm must do so.
Any Wall Street firm not large enough to clear for itself must contract with a clearing broker to back its trades; the cash balances the introducing broker must deposit as security with the clearing firm will vary with the volume and riskiness of the introducing broker's trades. If those trades become too risky, the clearing broker can demand a bigger deposit or force the firm to take its business elsewhere.
Whether by simple mismanagement or by deliberate design -- the issue is one now being litigated in bankruptcy court -- Adler did not push Hanover out the door in time. When Hanover failed, Adler was on the hook for trades that not only exceeded Hanover's cash deposit but that also exceeded Adler's own resources. On Feb. 27, 1995, Adler was forced into bankruptcy.
At that moment, the 41 other brokerage firms that had hired Adler to clear their trades were suddenly unable to conduct business. An important strand in the safety net was near the breaking point.
Behind the phalanx of clearing brokers is a sort of "broker of last resort": the National Securities Clearing Corporation, owned equally by the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market. The N.S.C.C. is the ultimate guarantor of stock trades, and it was suddenly left with $1.6 billion in trades that Adler's introducing brokers could not complete.
The N.S.C.C. froze all those trading accounts until other clearing firms were found that were willing to take them on. But what of the Hanover accounts? Ultimately they will be the responsibility of the last component of the Wall Street safety net: the SIPC, which up to certain limits protects retail customers from the loss of cash or securities when their brokerage firm fails.
In part because Mr. Mishkin, the SIPC trustee, had serious doubts about the validity of some trades done during Hanover's death throes, the Hanover accounts remained frozen.
At the same time, Mr. Mishkin saw that the Adler estate had one unusual asset: virtually the entire available supply of all those flimsy stocks Hanover had promoted and bought so heavily from short-sellers.
With all those shares tied up in frozen accounts, Mr. Mishkin turned the tables on the short-sellers by demanding that they cover their short sales to Hanover -- which they could only do by buying the shares in Adler's accounts at prices he would dictate. Mr. Mishkin set those prices at roughly the same levels that Hanover had paid when it bought the shares from the short sellers before the firm collapsed.
Thus, he deprived the bears of their profits and sent them stalking into court to argue that Mr. Mishkin had taken advantage of an illegal "corner on the market" to gouge the short-sellers. Mr. Mishkin insists his buy-in was legal and that it was the bears' massive short-selling that was illegal.
The rules that govern short sales are few and flexible. Except for smaller Nasdaq stocks, short sales can be made only after an uptick in prices. And any broker who sells short must first make an "affirmative determination" that he will be able to find and buy the shares he needs to cover his short sale. Clearing firms maintain lists of securities that are "hard to borrow," to guide short-sellers in assessing their risks -- and all of the Hanover securities were on those lists.
But brokerage firms are exempt from the affirmative determination rule provided they are engaged in "bona fide market making," as many of the short-selling firms contended they were. Mr. Mishkin argues that the shorts had signed up as market-makers in the Hanover stocks only to sell short more abundantly, not to genuinely make a market in the shares.
But the line between abusive short sales and bona fide market making is clearly not well defined.
Only a handful of criminal cases have cited illegal short-selling, according to securities lawyers, and regulatory cases are only slightly more common.
Judge Garrity will ultimately decide whether the trustee's buy-in was legal. If he upholds the short-sellers, SIPC will face much larger losses in the Adler case. If he backs Mr. Mishkin, short-sellers everywhere will face the new risk of an Adler-style buy-in that would wipe out their profits. And if investigators find widespread misbehavior by the bears in the Adler case, there could be new pressure to tighten the rules on short-selling.
But more important, the Adler case challenges the widespread Wall Street belief that the battles between obscure short-sellers and third-rate penny-stock hustlers do not matter much to the rest of the market because they only kill each other.
The death of Adler, Coleman showed that sometimes important components of the Wall Street safety net can become caught in the crossfire.

Chart: "The Cascade Effect"
 When a penny-stock promoter failed in February 1995, the resulting mess unexpectedly claimed its clearing agent as well, leaving stock speculators and a bankruptcy trustee at war over the wreckage, and the blame.
 
1. THE BEAR RAID
 
What Happened: Bearish speculators sold short a flood of shares in penny stocks promoted by Hanover Sterling ("house" stocks).
 
The Bears Say: The trades were legal, made for customers or in the course of legitimate market making.
 
The Trustee Says: The trades were part of an illegal conspiracy; the bears' "market making" was a sham.
 
2. THE BROKER COLLAPSED
 
What Happened: Hanover exhausted its capital buying house stocks in a losing effort to prop up prices.
 
The Bears Say: Hanover was illegally trying to rig the market.
 
The Trustee Says: The bears blackmailed Hanover and then pushed it over the brink anyway, hoping to profit when prices of the house stocks crashed as a result.
 
3. THE CLEARING AGENT COLLAPSED
 
What Happened: Adler, Coleman, which cleared and guaranteed Hanover's trades, could not fulfill its obligations. 12,000 Hanover accounts are among 66,000 frozen by the bankruptcy.
 
The Bears Say: Adler, Coleman took part in Hanover's market rigging.
 
The Trustee Says: The same illegal short sales that swamped Hanover overwhelmed Adler too.
 
4. DAMAGE CONTROL
 
What Happened: The trustee for the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which inherited the mess, demanded delivery of the shares sold short, without unfreezing the accounts that contain almost all those shares.
 
The Bears Say: The trustee is trying to use an illegal "corner" on the market to benefit SIPC at their expense.
 
The Trustee Says: The bears put themselves on the hook by trying to profit from the illegal short sales. (Patrick J. Lyons/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Stavros Niarchos, Greek Shipping Magnate And the Archrival of Onassis, Is Dead at 86

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Stavros S. Niarchos, the shadowy Greek shipping magnate who spent much of his life battling his archrival Aristotle Onassis for supremacy on the high seas, in conspicuous consumption and at the altar, died on Monday at a hospital in Zurich. He was 86.
Officials of Niarchos Ltd., the shipping company he built into an international behemoth that once operated more than 80 tankers, disclosed his death through its London office yesterday but gave no details. He was reported several weeks ago to have had a stroke. 
 Although he was known as a mystery man, there was little mystery in the way Stavros Spyros Niarchos built a personal fortune estimated at $4 billion.
Mr. Niarchos, whose name means "master of ships," was quite simply a master at seizing the moment and turning it to his advantage, especially if it involved the complex world of shipping. What others perceived as disaster, he recognized as opportunity, whether it be economic depression, war or a shortage -- or glut -- of oil.
The secret of his shipping success was deceptively simple: buy cheap and buy big.
Mr. Niarchos, who was conceived in Buffalo, N.Y., where his Greek-born parents had become naturalized American citizens, was born in Athens on July 3, 1909, three months after his parents had returned from the United States.
Growing up in the adjacent port city of Piraeus, he developed a lifelong love of the water, swimming frequently and sailing his first boat at the age of 9.
Although he earned a law degree from the University of Athens at age 20, his father's financial reversals forced him to seek a more immediately promising career; he joined a flour-milling operation operated by his maternal uncles. The business imported grain from Argentina, and seeking to keep costs down in the 1930's, Mr. Niarchos recognized that the family could save freight fees by operating its own ships.
At his urging, his uncles bought seven battered freighters at the Depression-level prices of $20,000 each, and the Niarchos fleet was born. He soon added to the holdings, always buying the largest ships available.
World War II proved a bonanza for him. He leased his ships to the Allies in 1941 and spent the rest of the war in the Greek Navy. When the war ended in 1945, Mr. Niarchos, who had become the assistant Greek naval attache in Washington, did not grieve over the loss of six of his ships to German bombs and submarine attacks, but took his $2 million in insurance proceeds and began buying up surplus Liberty and Victory cargo ships and T2 tankers that had been mass produced during the war.
To get around American restrictions on the sale of such ships to foreigners, Mr. Niarchos formed a company in which his American-born sister and some American friends owned a three-quarter interest. But after Mr. Niarchos compounded his audacity by leasing the ships to a Panamanian company to avoid American taxes, the Government sued and he agreed to pay a $12 million fine, give up some of the ships and have three supertankers built at American shipyards.
As usual, the settlement ended up to his advantage. It came as Mr. Niarchos, who had foreseen the postwar boom in trade, was beginning a shipbuilding spree. Not only did the three large tankers prove far more profitable than the smaller ships he had to surrender, but he also ended up commissioning others, each generally larger than the one before.
Mr. Niarchos was one of the first shipowners to grasp the economies of scale: that is, a ship that could carry twice as much oil at twice the fees did not cost twice as much to build or to operate.
But he was not the only one to understand the concept. So did another upstart Greek shipping magnate, Aristotle Socrates Onassis, and in the decade after the war the two began a rivalry that amounted to a global game of one-upmanship.
If Mr. Onassis built a 30,000-ton ship, Mr. Niarchos was sure to respond with one of 31,000 tons. The shipbuilding competition continued until 1956 when Mr. Niarchos launched the 47,750-ton Spyros Niarchos, then the largest tanker afloat.
And Mr. Niarchos, who became a hero in Greece by building the country's first shipyard after the war, found himself upstaged when Mr. Onassis became an even bigger hero in the jet age by creating Olympic Airways.
For Mr. Niarchos, who savored his title as the owner of the largest private tanker fleet, 1956 was to prove the high-water mark in his competition with Mr. Onassis. Curiously, his very success caused his setback. When the Suez crisis of 1956 closed the canal, created a huge new demand for tankers and doubled shipping rates, much of his own vast fleet was tied up in long-term contracts at the pre-crisis rates, while Mr. Onassis, who had largely been locked out of the market by Mr. Niarchos, was able to take advantage of the crisis and cash in on the higher rates.
But the Onassis advantage proved short-lived. Mr. Niarchos simply bullied his way out of the old contracts, arguing that conditions had changed.
By then the personal rivalry between the two men had extended beyond the world of commercial shipping. Mr. Onassis, for example, was clearly jealous at glowing magazine reports pointing out that Mr. Niarchos, who maintained numerous palatial homes around the world, preferred to run his business from the 190-foot Creole, invariably described as the world's largest and most beautiful sailing vessel.
The Onassis response was to commission the 325-foot Christina, a motorized vessel, to be sure, but one that became the cynosure of prying eyes, at least until Mr. Niarchos abandoned the Creole in favor of the motorized Atlantis, 50 feet longer than the Christina.
And when Mr. Niarchos bought the Aegean island of Spetsopoula and stocked it with rare plants and game, making it a hunting paradise where he entertained royalty, heads of state and members of the jet set, Mr. Onassis bought an island of his own, Skorios, six years later.
Mr. Niarchos's good sense of timing saved his fortune. He sold off most of his fleet of tankers before the bottom fell out of the industry in the 1970's. But he and Mr. Onassis were both bruised by the protracted downturn. In 1970 they even entered into a rare joint venture, to build an oil refinery in Greece.
Mr. Niarchos stayed in the business, but the fleet of Niarchos Ltd. whose offices are in London, is a mere shadow consisting of about eight oil tankers. His family had remained deeply involved in the business, including his three sons, who are expected to continue managing the fleet.
In their personal rivalry, when Mr. Onassis scored a social coup by marrying Tina Livanos, the daughter of the long-reigning Greek shipping czar Stavros Livanos, Mr. Niarchos, who had been married and divorced twice, responded by marrying the other Livanos daughter, Eugenie.
It was a rivalry Mr. Niarchos was destined to lose, but he had his moments. In 1965, for example, he divorced Eugenie and at the age of 56 married Charlotte Ford, the 24-year-old daughter of Henry Ford 2d, the American automobile industry leader. She gave birth to a child a few months later and they were divorced in 1967.
The next year Mr. Onassis played his matrimonial trump card by marrying Jacqueline Kennedy, the widow of the slain American President, John F. Kennedy, and widely regarded as the world's most admired woman.
Since the Greek Church had not recognized Mr. Niarchos's Mexican divorce, he blithely resumed his marriage to Eugenie. After she died of an overdose of sleeping pills in 1970, Mr. Niarchos obtained some consolation by marrying Mr. Onassis' former wife, Tina.
Her death in Paris in 1974, also from an overdose of sleeping pills, created something of a scandal when her daughter, Christina Onassis, demanded an autopsy with the implication that Mr. Niarchos may have had a hand in her death. The investigation cleared him.
The death of Mr. Onassis in 1975 left Mr. Niarchos without a rival to fuel his ambitions.
Although he invested huge sums in various industries, he seemed to spend more time spending his money in the last years of his life, savoring his art collections, for example, and cheering on his racehorses. He also gave some of his money away, in 1979 donating $5 million to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center to help repay the cost of heart surgery performed over the years on more than 100 Greek children.
His survivors include two daughters, Maria and Elena Anne; three sons, Philip, Spyros and Constantine, and several grandchildren.

HEADLINE: States Are Arenas on Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 17

 BODY:
At a time when both major political parties are trying to speak to people's fears about the economy, Democrats here and in other state capitals across the country are using proposals to increase state minimum wages to try to reclaim their mantle as the defender of working people.
In states like Minnesota and Nebraska, Republicans have been forced to go on the record opposing measures to increase state minimums, and in Connecticut today, the Democratic-controlled House voted in favor of an increase, putting Republicans in what can be a politically uncomfortable position of opposing a raise of 88 cents, to $5.15 from $4.27. 
 Connecticut's Legislature is one of at least 17 that have seen measures to increase the wage introduced this year. Labor unions have also pushed to place the issue on ballots in states like California and Missouri and in cities like New Orleans, Washington and Denver.
The measure here still faces opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate and from the Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, but Democrats consider the mere fact of a vote being taken as something of a victory. Democratic leaders here and across the nation call the issue a powerful cudgel to hammer Republicans as insensitive to the plight of the working poor. "That sort of 'let them eat cake indifference' to the real life of the working poor says an awful lot about a politician," said William E. Curry Jr., an adviser to President Clinton and former Democratic gubernatorial candidate here.
Republicans here dismissed the vote as a cynical effort aimed solely at the next election. "It's being done for only one reason, and I think it's important for people to understand why it's being raised now," said State Representative Chris DePino, the state Republican Party chairman. "It's an election year."
According to the state's Office of Legislative Research, 43 states, including Connecticut, have minimum wage laws, though only 10 are above the Federal standard of $4.25. Generally, states pass higher minimums citing higher costs of living.
In the remaining states, 25 have provisions that mirror the Federal standard. In the eight states with a minimum wage below the Federal minimum, the Federal standard pre-empts the state's, and the state law applies only to employees, like agricultural workers, who are not covered by the Federal provision.
To some extent, the debate in state legislatures involves the same arguments that are heard in Washington. Generally, Democrats argue that a higher minimum will improve workers' standard of living, while Republicans maintain that it will cost jobs.
But the move to increase the minimum has gained momentum in recent years as new research has broken the view held by many economists that the raise would lead employers to hire fewer people.
Although some economists still hold that a nationwide increase of 75 cents -- President Clinton has proposed a 90-cent rise -- would cost 60,000 jobs, others dispute these findings. Last year, Robert M. Solow, a Nobel Laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, "The evidence of job loss is weak, and the fact that the evidence is weak suggests that the impact on jobs is small."
In state legislatures, the debate takes on a slightly different focus. Here in Connecticut, lawmakers today were not so much worried about losing manufacturing jobs to cheaper competition abroad but about preventing workers in places like 7-Elevens and fast-food restaurants from losing their jobs. They also expressed fears that an increase in Connecticut would mark the state as a place that is not friendly to business.
State Representative Robert Ward, the Republican minority leader, remarked on Tuesday, "Executives aren't going to want to go to a state where they see an activist General Assembly that tells them how to run their businesses."
But State Representative David Pudlin, a top House Democrat, dismissed such concerns, asserting that more money in people's pockets meant that more people would be spending more money. "It is wrong to say that out of affection for poor people you have to oppose the bill," he said today.
In a preliminary vote, largely along party lines, the higher state minimum for Connecticut was backed by a vote of 85 to 62. Final passage is required for the measure to reach the State Senate.
Under the measure, the minimum wage would be increased 50 cents in October and another 38 cents in October 1997, to $5.15 from $4.27.
New Jersey's minimum wage was increased to $5.05 in 1992. On Monday, the New York State Assembly approved an increase to $5.05 from $4.25, though Gov. George E. Pataki has said he opposes raising the minimum wage at this time.
Yet the Connecticut measure faces extremely steep hurdles before it can become law. Gov. Rowland has said that he would veto any increase, and it is unlikely that Republicans in the Senate will even let it be considered there.
Still, for Democrats, simply getting a vote on the measure is considered something of a victory.
Sheldon Silver, the New York Assembly leader, said, "It clearly defines the Democrats as to where they are and what they stand for."
Before today's vote in Connecticut, State Representative Ronald S. San Angelo, a Republican, resisted entreaties by his Democratic colleague, Mr. Pudlin, to cross the aisle and support it.
"Not everyone has your courage," Mr. Pudlin said with a smile. "Some of us want to win the next election."
Already in Massachusetts, Senator John F. Kerry, a Democrat, has attacked his Republican challenger, Gov. William F. Weld for vetoing a one dollar increase in the minimum wage, a move that the Legislature overrode.
In Minnesota, where Gov. Arne Carlson, a Republican, vetoed a minimum wage bill last week, the State Senate sponsor, Kevin Chandler, remarked, "This is a softball right over the plate for the Democrats."

HEADLINE: World Bank Gets Bosnia Aid Role

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
As they embark in earnest on efforts to rebuild Bosnia, the United States and the European Union have handed over much of the job to the World Bank, an institution widely criticized for its slow-moving bureaucracy and its spotty record in similar programs.
The bank played a key role in raising the $1.2 billion pledged to the reconstruction program for the rest of this year at a conference this weekend in Brussels, including more than $200 million from the United States. 
 Established in 1944 under American leadership with its main purpose the reconstruction of a war-shattered Europe, the bank later became almost solely devoted to helping impoverished third-world countries.
Now the bank has taken on the monumental role in Bosnia and Herzegovina of overseeing what is expected to be $5.1 billion of reconstruction projects, drawing up plans to rebuild roads, railways, power plants, phone systems and the other basic components of a functioning economy.
With its long experience in the world's poorest countries, the World Bank was not a surprising choice. But in Bosnia, where war has left behind not just hatred but land mines, millions of refugees, billions of dollars in damage and a decimated economy, the job is by most measures bigger and more critical than any the bank has previously taken on.
"I've been saying for some time that development banks are to the new world order what security organizations were to the old," said Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. "The World Bank's role in Bosnia surely illustrates that."
The bank, which is used to taking years to draw up plans and then waiting additional years for results, must make substantial, visible progress in Bosnia by the end of the year, when NATO troops are scheduled to leave, or the risk of resuming war will be high.
"The challenge is to move quickly, especially for organizations like the World Bank where time frames are usually longer," said William D. Montgomery, the State Department's special adviser for carrying out the Bosnian peace plan.
By its own standards, the bank has moved quickly in Bosnia. It had made the only comprehensive study of Bosnia's economic needs even before the peace accords were signed last fall. It committed $150 million of its own funds to emergency short-term measures at the end of January. It is helping to match money from donor nations, which usually comes with strings attached, to specific programs. And in recent weeks it gave the go-ahead to three long-term programs covering transportation, agriculture and sewers and water supply, taking only a few months for an approval process that normally takes a year.
James D. Wolfensohn, the former Wall Street investment banker who became the World Bank's president last June, said that while concerns about the bank's ability to move quickly were valid, he is trying to make the institution more nimble and responsive.
"The institution has a merited reputation for being long-term and bureaucratic, but along with my colleagues I'm trying to cut that down," Mr. Wolfensohn said. "There is a growing and significant consensus in this institution that we need to move more quickly, that we need to have greater accountability and that we need the capacity to do things in an urgent time frame. It's particularly important to do that in post-conflict situations, but we're also trying to do it generally."
The bank is already well into a similar program in the West Bank and Gaza, trying to create jobs and economic hope there as those regions adapt to autonomy from Israel. But it has had little success there, analysts and some members of the bank's staff said, especially in its goal of creating jobs. As a result, there are doubts about the bank's ability to succeed in Bosnia, where the scale of the problem is so much bigger.
"Put me down as skeptical," said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a Republican who has raised questions about whether the American contribution will be used effectively. "I'm not opposed to the World Bank. But the World Bank is not always very effective, and it certainly hasn't been very effective in the West Bank and Gaza multilateral effort."
But others, including senior bank officials, argue that because the former Yugoslavia had a relatively advanced economy and an educated work force, Bosnia has a more solid foundation for rapid development than exists in Gaza or the West Bank.
Another problem will be financing in Bosnia. While the United States, Western Europe, Japan, some Islamic countries and others have pledged enough to finance the programs that bank deems essential for this year, bank officials and diplomats said it is unclear whether the necessary money will be available in coming years.
For the World Bank and for other international organizations playing a big role in Bosnia, including the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, there is another big issue at stake in Bosnia. Their efforts to bring stability and improved living standards to the region amount to the biggest test yet of their ability to play the broader role in the economic side of foreign policy that many governments, constrained by budget and political problems at home, want them to assume.
"The real test for the international community is whether it can respond effectively enough immediately, and in the medium term to get these countries moving on a self-sustaining basis," Mr. Wolfensohn said. "The bank is a front line player, but the bank cannot do it alone."
In Bosnia, as in the West Bank and Gaza, Mr. Wolfensohn said, the World Bank is adapting to new responsibilities and pressures. It has given its managers who are on the scene much greater authority and responsibility than ever before. Rather than reporting through a bureaucratic maze, they report to a single person at the bank's headquarters in Washington, who in turn reports to the board. Most important,they can make most decisions on their own, Mr. Wolfensohn said.
But even as he gives the bank's staff more freedom and authority, he is broadening its task. Instead of concentrating just on the big construction projects for which the bank is best known, he has been promoting development of programs intended to create jobs and contribute to social stability.
Mr. Wolfensohn said a primary goal of the reconstruction program in Bosnia should be to create as many as 300,000 jobs through a combination of public works programs and narrowly targeted projects to support small businesses and farmers, among others. In addition, he called for a program to provide cheap materials plus a stipend to people who are willing to rebuild their own homes.
The World Bank has come under increasing criticism in recent years. Critics contend that the bank has failed in its efforts to fight world poverty, and that many of its construction projects in developing nations are environmental disasters.
In Bosnia, the bank's reputation has clearly been put further at risk.
Even though he sees his institution as one of several key players, Mr. Wolfensohn admits, "It's there that people may blame the bank."

HEADLINE: F.T.C. to Fight Rite Aid-Revco Drugstore Merger

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that it would seek to block the Rite Aid Corporation's planned $1.8 billion takeover of Revco D.S. Inc., holding that the merger of the nation's biggest drugstore chains would raise drug prices for consumers.
The unanimous decision by the agency's commissioners means that Government lawyers will seek a Federal court injunction barring the merger, pending an administrative hearing on whether it violates antitrust laws. 
 Attorneys general of several states, including New York, also said they would sue to block the merger, citing its potential anticompetitive effects.
One analyst said that he saw scant opening for compromise given the tough positions taken by the F.T.C. and the state attorneys general.
"On the face of it, this has all the signs of a deal that is ready to blow up," Gary Vineberg, a retailing analyst with Merrill Lynch, said.
George S. Cary, the deputy director of the Federal agency's Bureau of Competition, said the agency believed that the merger would create a dominant market force in numerous areas because many stores of the chains serve overlapping markets.
As a result, the newly formed company may command enough market share to lift prices both to individuals and to discount drug plans that companies offer as employee benefits, the agency found.
"These two companies are head-to-head competitors, and they cover virtually the same territory," Mr. Cary said.
Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., said it planned to extend its $27.50-a-share tender offer for Revco, which is due to expire tomorrow, through Wednesday. The company said it planned to use that additional time to negotiate for an out-of-court settlement with the agency, which generally waits until tender offers expire before seeking injunctions.
Officials of Revco, which is based in Twinsburg, Ohio, declined to comment. "These discussions are between the F.T.C. and the Rite Aid Corporation," said Tom Dingledy , a company spokesman.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Rite Aid stock closed at $30.875 a share, down 12.5 cents. Revco stock closed at $26.75 a share, down 37.5 cents.
The proposed merger had come under intense scrutiny by the agency. Rite Aid, the nation's largest drugstore chain, operates 2,760 stores nationwide. Revco, the second largest, has 2,100.
The agency last sought to block an acquisition of this size in 1994 when B.A.T. Industries moved to buy the American Tobacco Company from American Brands Inc. for $1 billion. Under an agreement, B.A.T and its Brown & Williamson subsidiary agreed to sell several discount cigarette brands and a manufacturing plant. But the F.T.C recently rejected the company's attempt to sell those properties to Lorillard, a unit of the Loews Corporation.
Yesterday's action comes amid a swirl of investigations and lawsuits over the issue of drug pricing, with much of the focus on the growing role of prescription drug sales to group plans.
The F.T.C, for example, is investigating whether drug makers are selling drugs at preferred prices to health maintenance organizations and other big buyers. Discount chains like Rite Aid have filed lawsuits against drug manufacturers, making similar allegations. Meanwhile, Merck-Medco Managed Care Inc., a unit of Merck & Company, filed suit in February, accusing Rite Aid and other pharmacies of antitrust violations in Maryland. Rite Aid has denied the allegations.
Keith Shugarman, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in antitrust matters, said that he was not surprised by the agency's decision that the proposed merger between Rite Aid and Revco would have an anticompetitive effect.
"The F.T.C seems to have the law, the economics, the evidence and the politics all in their favor and things don't usually line up so neatly," Mr. Shugarman said.
Mr. Cary, the regulator, said that in some cities, like Cleveland and Erie, Pa., the largest competitor to a combined Rite Aid and Revco would be half its size.
Rite Aid has had its share of troubles with the F.T.C of late. After the agency challenged a 1994 acquisition, Rite Aid, as part of a consent agreement, said it would shed certain assets. But in February, the agency appointed a trustee to oversee the company's sale of pharmacy assets in several stores it owned in Maine and New Hampshire after finding that Rite Aid had failed to meet its deadline.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS TOLD TO BRACE FOR VOTE ON MINIMUM WAGE

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
The wall of Republican opposition to raising the minimum wage cracked today when Speaker Newt Gingrich told House Republicans that they should prepare themselves to face a vote on the issue -- a vote that would almost surely lead to an increase.
In both the House and the Senate, lawmakers of both parties agree that an increase will pass if there is a vote on the proposal. Though the issue came to a boil in the Senate this week when Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, blocked a vote, the rules and leadership in the House had seemed to be the most serious obstacles on Capitol Hill. 
 Mr. Gingrich spoke at a closed-door caucus this morning. According to several lawmakers present, he said he expected the Senate to vote on the minimum wage issue and pass an increase. When that happens, the Speaker reportedly said, the House can no longer duck it, and many members will vote for a raise.
Mr. Gingrich said that when the issue was last brought up, in 1989, only 37 Representatives opposed it. All but two were Republicans.
His comments were precipitated by defections yesterday and today of 20 House Republicans, who introduced a bill to raise the current Federal hourly minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.25 over 15 months. That is 10 cents more per hour than President Clinton and Congressional Democrats have proposed.
A high Administration official said he was "virtually certain" Mr. Clinton would agree to the higher figure.
After the caucus meeting today, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the fourth-ranking House Republican, said the leadership could not thwart a determined majority. "There appears to be an awful lot of support, even though it is horrible economic policy," Mr. Boehner said. He contends that an increase would cost jobs.
Mr. Gingrich's caucus remarks came after discussions on Tuesday with Mr. Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee. Senator Dole said today that he and Mr. Gingrich had discussed the issue, and that he was studying it and seeking advice. But he added that he had not told the Speaker that the Senate would vote on the issue.
On Tuesday, Mr. Dole angrily pulled an immigration bill from the Senate floor to prevent Democrats from offering an amendment to raise the minimum wage.
Other Senate Republicans, however, seemed to think a vote was inevitable. They spoke scornfully of Democratic efforts to use the wage issue as a means to embarrass Mr. Dole's Presidential campaign, but many consider the issue a loser, for him and for themselves, and want to get it over with.
"You can't just leave it at $4.25," said Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming. Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas agreed. "Be realistic," she said. "It would carry here."
They also acknowledge that Democrats can keep on pressing the issue, as Republicans did on their causes in years past. "We sort of wrote the book, and now they are reading it," said Senator Daniel R. Coats of Indiana.
Still, the lack of a Republican consensus in the Senate was clear. Senator John McCain of Arizona said: "Some people want to compromise. Some people want to go ahead and have a vote. Some people want to keep on stalling. There is no cohesion."
Another Senator, insisting on anonymity, said, "It's ring around the rosy."
Democrats used the developments in the House to press Mr. Dole for action. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the chief sponsor of the increase, said: "Opposition to the minimum wage is clearly dwindling in both the Senate and the House. The case for a fair increase is gaining strength every day. I don't know why the majority leader would climb on a sinking ship."
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich joined the fray, saying: "Senator Dole has it in his power to bring this to a vote and get this done in the Senate. I don't believe he wants to be seen any longer blocking a modest increase in the minimum wage."
Mr. Dole said tonight, in an interview on the Public Broadcasting Service program "NewsHour With Jim Lehrer," that he was considering legislation that would combine a minimum wage increase with some other legislative proposal that Republicans liked but Democrats disliked. But he said that while there were strong economic arguments against a higher minimum wage, "you can't explain it," and an increase is very popular politically.
Asked later at a news conference to explain what other legislation he might add to a bill raising the minimum wage and whether he would suggest a lesser increase, Mr. Dole said, "We are looking at some options, may or may not pursue them." Then he added, "It won't happen this week."
Most of the 20 House Republicans who announced their bill today are from the Northeast.
One of seven New Yorkers in the group, Representative Jack Quinn of Buffalo, said: "People who work a 40-hour week ought to make a wage they can live on. The minimum wage hasn't been increased in seven years. Even welfare pays much more. We must correct this so people are not forced to choose between work and supporting their families."
Another upstate New Yorker, Representative Amo Houghton of Corning, said: "This is not a complicated issue. It should not be a partisan issue. It's timely. It's right and I think we should do it."
Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, stressed the argument that inflation has cut the value of the minimum wage. If it is not changed, he said, "the real value of the minimum wage will be at a 40-year low by next January."
Ten years ago, the minimum wage was $3.35 an hour. In today's dollars, that would be $4.64.
But among other House Republicans, there were sharp arguments that raising the minimum wage would be bad policy.
The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, who opposed the 1989 increase when Mr. Gingrich voted for it, said: "Raising the minimum wage won't benefit working Americans; it will only increase the number of non-working Americans by destroying crucial entry-level jobs. The whole issue is a sham on the part of the Washington union bosses that fund the Democrat Party."

HEADLINE: In Summit Silences, a Truce In U.S.-Japanese Trade Wars

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, April 18

 BODY:
What is striking about the summit meeting this week between President Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is what is not being heard or seen.
No Japanese cars are being smashed in front of the Capitol in Washington, no trade negotiators are wielding crowbars, and, most important, there are no mutual recriminations about protectionism. Instead of threatening each other over trade disputes, the American and Japanese leaders are hailing the virtues of cooperation. 
 Indeed, the battlefront of trade here is so quiet these days that some people are declaring an end to the era of trade wars. Now, the United States has more disputes with Canada than it has with Japan. When Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor met on Tuesday with the Japanese Trade Minister, Shunpei Tsukahara, the talks lasted a pleasant 10 minutes.
"The era of bilateralism is over," Yoshihiro Sakamoto, a deputy minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said in a speech last month.
So, is this just a short-lived truce? Or are there more fundamental factors at work that have rendered the American-Japanese relationship more cordial?
Even President Clinton was somewhat ambiguous when he acknowledged in a speech to Parliament today that the trade relationship was "not entirely free of friction."
Experts disagree about the longer term, although they are united that the relationship for now is unusually peaceful on the trade front. Even those who fear new skirmishes will erupt soon say some of the heat and anger may have dissipated.
"Looking over the next two years at the Japanese economic cycle, there is less reason to be fearful over a trade war," said Michael J. Hartnett, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. "The final hurrah would come if Japan's Government would decide to deregulate the economy strongly."
For a relationship that for decades has been fraught more with acridity than amity, it may seem almost impossible to trade in peace, and perhaps Mr. Sakamoto's declaration is a dream. Certainly there are several disputes bubbling, ranging from film to semiconductors to some insurance issues like medical care.
Japan still has a long way before it sheds its protectionist reputation and opens its markets as wide as other developed countries. And critics assert that this trade truce is politically orchestrated and will be just a lull before another storm breaks out after the American elections.
"The Administration wants to take credit till November," said an American business executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's only a very short lull, until next year."
"Because of the recession here and growth elsewhere, the view of Japan as a threat and a rival is low," he added. "There is less of a sense of urgency about Japan, but the view of Japan as a serious rival is going to resurface."
If the strength of the American economy, for instance, leads to a surge of buying Japanese products, like machinery and electronic goods, then America's trade deficit with Japan could bounce back up again.
Still, however testy the trade disputes may grow, it is difficult to imagine Americans as infuriated about the tertiary insurance market as they were about cars. As the issues become more complex, they arouse fewer passions.
Moreover, Japan's trade surplus is dropping dramatically both with the United States and with the world as a whole. This is partly the effect of the strengthening yen, which makes American imports cheaper and Japanese exports more expensive. Furthermore, structural changes finally seem to be taking hold in the Japanese economy.
Since 1992, Japan's current account surplus, which occurs when a country exports more goods and services than it imports, has slid from 3.2 percent of real gross domestic product to 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, dipping below the psychological barrier of 2 percent. And the monthly bilateral trade surplus with the United States has also steadily fallen.
According to Government statistics released today, the trade surplus with America dropped to $3.28 billion in March, down 35.6 percent from the $5.09 billion of March a year ago.
Moreover, American exports to Japan surged about 20 percent last year over the previous year. In some areas, like cars, they rose by 80 percent. So it is becoming more difficult for American officials to call Japan a looming threat or a dirty trader or to mount an attack against Japan.
"Without a large Japanese surplus, any strident campaign wouldn't work," Masaru Yoshitomi, a top economist at the Long Term Credit Bank Research Institute, said in a telephone interview from the Wharton Business School in Philadelphia, where he is currently teaching.
"Politics can only play a small role," he said. "It can talk up or talk down and can only last a few weeks, but it has to be supported by the fundamentals."
The current sticky disputes are also much smaller than the trade balance in cars, which represents nearly half of Japan's bilateral trade surplus. Cars were the subject of the big trade dispute that was finally resolved last June.
"The automobile issue was a kind of symbolic issue for the two nations," said Makoto Kishida, an economist at Mitsui & Company's trade institute. "Insurance, maybe photofilm and semiconductors -- these items are less symbolic."
Some economists and business leaders argue that distaste for America's bilateral pressure tactics might force United States trade negotiators to turn to international forums like the World Trade Organization to resolve disputes. Already, there is talk of that route for the battle over color film, though that could also result in a confrontation.
"Ideally this is the direction we are moving in," said an American official who insisted on anonymity.
The battlefield approach to Japan is in some ways also being eclipsed by new challenges for America elsewhere in Asia. In China, for instance, the trade surplus with America is expanding rapidly, and troubles have increased over intellectual property rights and piracy of creative products like software and CD's.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Broad Global Role for Japan

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, April 18

 BODY:
Bringing a state visit to an end, President Clinton today urged Japan to forge an alliance with the United States for the next century, with a growing commitment to free trade and to an expanding international leadership role that "flows from its place as a great nation."
In an address to Parliament this morning, Mr. Clinton also said the American people "profoundly regret" the rape of a Okinawan schoolgirl by three American servicemen last September, an attack that shook the security alliance by provoking an anti-American backlash. 
 But he strongly defended the American presence in Asia, which was ratified in the joint declaration he signed on Wednesday with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
"Consider what might happen if the United States were to withdraw entirely from this region," Mr. Clinton said. "It could spark a costly arms race that could destabilize northeast Asia. It could hinder our ability to work with you to maintain security in a part of the world that has suffered enough in the 20th century through world war and regional conflicts and that is now in the midst of profound change."
Mr. Clinton discreetly avoided any reference to China, whose military exercises in the Taiwan Strait recently sent tremors through Asia. But he noted that a United States withdrawal from Asia "would weaken our power to deter states like North Korea that may still threaten peace."
Much of the President's speech was devoted to urging Japan to end its economic protectionism and hesitation about a role in world affairs. Noting that Japan had sent peacekeepers to Cambodia and minesweepers to the Persian Gulf, and had committed $500 million in reconstruction aid to Bosnia, he said, "We are all better off for your commitment to this kind of leadership."
"Today, to a great Japanese people whose pride in the past is now matched by your focus on the future, I say, stay true to that commitment to lead," Mr. Clinton said. "Make it even stronger. We have come so far in the last 50 years. Think about it: from the waste of war to the wealth of peace, from conflict to cooperation and competition, from mistrust to partnership."
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that American-Japanese trade relations were "not entirely free of friction." But as he has throughout his visit here, he played down the many areas of specific disagreement. Instead, he argued that open markets and American exports would benefit both nations.
"For Americans those exports mean more jobs at better pay," he said. "For the people of Japan, allowing these American goods and services to compete for the favors of the Japanese consumer means greater choice at lower prices."
Mr. Clinton was only the second American President to address Japan's Parliament; Ronald Reagan spoke here 1983. He received a standing ovation when he finished his speech and another one as he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, stood at the front of the chamber of the House of Representatives bowing their heads slightly in a Japanese-style gesture of courtesy.
Mr. Clinton's visit to Japan came midway through a weeklong tour that will now take him to Moscow, where he is to attend a nine-nation summit meeting on nuclear security and meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin, who is in an election struggle.
The crucial centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's visit to Japan came on Wednesday when he and Mr. Hashimoto signed a joint declaration endorsing the American military presence in the Asia-Pacific region as "essential for preserving peace and stability" in an area rattled by North Korea's incursions into the demilitarized zone separating it from South Korea and China's military maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait.
The security declaration affirmed that the United States would maintain its troop strength in the region at 100,000, the same number it maintains in Europe. The declaration also incorporated a plan for the American military to return an air base, two communications centers, a port and other military properties on Okinawa, where the rape of the girl set off anti-American protests.
The leaders also signed a separate document setting forth areas of cooperation between the two nations on regional disputes and in the United Nations.
On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Clinton visited an aircraft carrier that had recently been deployed in the Taiwan Strait in order to thank the American forces serving in Japan.
On the carrier deck of the Independence, the oldest active ship in the service, under the banner "Don't Tread on Me," Mr. Clinton told the sailors and marines that their presence in the strait during China's military exercises "reassured nations all around the Pacific."
The President also saluted the crew of the Japanese cruiser Myoko, who had joined the ceremonies at the Yokosuka Naval Base outside Tokyo.
"Fifty years ago no one would have believed that an American carrier and a Japanese cruiser could be berthed side by side, that our forces would work shoulder to shoulder, day in and day out," Mr. Clinton said.
On Wednesday night the President and his wife were welcomed by Emperor Akihito at a white-tie state dinner in the Imperial Palace. Toasting the Emperor and his wife, Mr. Clinton remarked on how far the alliance had come since Japan's defeat in World War II.
"History offers very few examples of two peoples who have forged such a powerful relationship in the short period of half a century," he said. "We have indeed traveled far together. We have created in modern times a great democratic tradition."
At a similar official dinner in 1992, President Bush fell ill, his discomfort recorded by a television camera. This time, according to an American official familiar with the arrangements, the Japanese required that television cameras be turned off after an official photo session and pointed away from the tables.

HEADLINE: Voters Approved More Than Two-Thirds of School Budgets

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., April 17

 BODY:
For the second year in a row, more than two-thirds of New Jersey's local school budgets were approved Tuesday, suggesting that voters generally are in a mellow mood about education spending and the property taxes that help finance it.
Statewide, 67.8 percent, or 374 of 552, budgets passed, slightly below the 72.3 percent that were approved in school elections last spring. Suburban counties with school systems regarded as the state's best and costliest had the highest rates of approval, including Essex (93.8 percent), Bergen (79.7), Morris (82.1), Somerset (78.9), Monmouth (75.9) and Union (75). In Middlesex County, usually a hotbed of school-budget hostility, voters accepted 65 percent of the budgets. Last April, Middlesex voters approved only 39 percent of district budgets and in 1994 only 26 percent. 
 In recent months, the issue of financing schools has been relatively calm across New Jersey, free of the angry taxpayer revolt that hobbled the Florio administration in 1990 and doomed many budgets in 1994. That year, the Whitman administration initiated a policy of minimal annual increases in state education aid to local districts. Total state aid of $4 billion for the 1996-97 school year remains flat, and many wealthier districts have tightened spending.
Statewide turnout for the elections was about 18 percent of registered voters, slightly higher than usual. Neil Upmeyer, president for the Center for Analysis of Public Issues in Princeton, said he believed voters were in a "positive mood." He said he attributed that to a slowly recovering economy, the popularity of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, and property taxes increasing only at the rate of inflation.
"I think there's less incentive for taxpayers to rise up in arms against school budgets," Mr. Upmeyer said. "If they don't feel threatened by taxes, they don't vote against them."
Even voters in Belleville, a blue-collar neighbor of Newark, were upbeat. They approved the school budget for only the third time in 30 years, 1,064 to 1,010. "For us, that's a landslide," said the superintendent, Michael Lally. "I'm euphoric."
He said Belleville's budget of $32 million was up only 2.45 percent, controlled by eliminating some supervisory positions, consolidating others and requiring some students with learning disabilities to attend less costly local public schools.
But in some school districts, local issues helped doom budgets. Voters in Edison, a sprawling suburb of 30 square miles in Middlesex County, rejected a $104 million budget overwhelmingly, partly because of a squabble over busing students, the superintendent, Melindo Persi said. About 7,000 of Edison's 12,000 take buses to their schools, even though only about 3,500 are required to be bused. Edison's Town Government now pays the $500,000 cost of the so-called "courtesy busing" program. But it will not renew the financing, and the school board refuses to pick up the cost. The defeated school budget will be reviewed by the Town Government.
And in Florence Township, a community on the Delaware River south of Trenton, voters angry about high taxes rejected the budget by a 5-to-1 margin and elected the high school's senior class valedictorian, Jaime Fauver, to the school board. The town's two senior-citizen groups had endorsed Ms. Fauver's platform of reducing taxes and cutting administrative costs. Ms. Fauver said she plans to commute to college and will be able to make board meetings.
