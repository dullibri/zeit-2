HEADLINE: Dow Rises 32.51 Points to Another High Close

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks staged a strong rally late yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to its eighth record high in nine sessions. But a weakness in the technology sector pushed the Nasdaq composite index lower.
The gains also included new highs in three broader market indexes and came despite jitters about the economy that sent investors seeking consumer stalwarts and selling economically sensitive shares. 
 The Dow ended 32.51 points higher, closing at 5,492.12.
Additionally, the New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 1.64 points, to 346.32; the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 3.60 points, to 649.93, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 2.63, to 562.59. All three indexes broke records for the third consecutive session.
But the Nasdaq index fell 4.20 points, to 1,084.88, as technology shares came under pressure.
Stocks meandered, mostly in positive territory, for much of yesterday's session, held down by a declining bond market.
Bond prices fell as the market absorbed new supply, including yesterday's auction of $14 billion of 10-year Government notes and the sale of $30 billion of 30-year Treasury bonds that is scheduled for today. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32 in price; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 6.15 percent.
But stocks shook off the doldrums late in the session, with the Dow making nearly all of the day's gains in the final 45 minutes of trading.
In a reversal of Tuesday's record-breaking session, investors shed economically sensitive stocks in favor of consumer issues and more recession-resistant names.
"There is some backing and filling going on into consumer stocks, which had been weak, and some retail names." said John Church, chief investment officer at the Glenmede Trust Company in Philadephia.
But Mr. Church said he was optimistic about the stock market. "Stocks aren't cheap on the basis of yields, and certainly after the 30-something-percent rally last year, you can't say they're really cheap," he said. "But I think there's an equal risk attached to being out of the market. In 1987, when the market crashed, you had the competition from bonds at 10 percent; today they're at 6" percent.
Among retailers, Sears, Roebuck & Company rose 1 3/4, to 44 3/8, and J. C. Penney added 1 1/2, to 49 3/8. Drug makers also gained, with Merck & Company rising 1 5/8 a share, to 69, and Pharmacia Upjohn up 1 1/2, to 43 1/2. McDonald's, another high-profile consumer stock, rose 1 5/8, to 53 1/4, while Coca-Cola added 1 3/8 a share, to 78.
But technology stocks retreated from gains earlier in the week, after Montgomery Securities downgraded several of them, saying the group had "limited upside potential and heightened uncertainty."
On the Big Board, I.B.M. dropped 1 7/8, to 112 5/8; Micron Technology fell 1/2, to 41 3/8; Texas Instruments lost 1 1/4, to 53 3/8, and Compaq Computer declined 3/8, to 50 3/4.
Semiconductor stocks sank ahead of the Semiconductor Association's announcement of its January report on sales and new orders. The release of the figures had been expected late yesterday but was postponed until after the close of trading today.
Neither the bond nor stock markets were much impressed yesterday with a Commerce Department report that the nation's trade deficit declined 13.5 percent in November to $7.06 billion.
Economists said the number was not important, since it indicated that a softening United States economy had lowered demand for imports.

HEADLINE: Rowland Budget Retreats From Sharp Cuts of Last Year

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Stepping back from the sharp cuts he offered last year, Gov. John G. Rowland today proposed a budget that features a modest reduction in overall spending and increased aid for the elderly, children and the state's ailing cities.
"I believe in a government that is bold enough to be basic," Mr. Rowland said in his second annual address to the Legislature. "It must help to care for the children and the elderly who are alone or who are endangered." 
 Although the budget includes substantial cuts in several social service programs, the Governor's speech focused instead on programs where he intended to spend more.
For example, he promised to rescind one of last year's most controversial cuts, a $40 million reduction in nursing home programs. And he called for an additional $12 million for a program that helps disabled children, as well as adding 219 employees to the agency that oversees children in troubled families.
He also unveiled a much-anticipated urban agenda that includes $78 million in bonding for projects in the cities, an amount that some criticized as too little to have any impact.
But at the same time, Mr. Rowland did not abandon the tough changes to the state welfare system that he considers among the top accomplishments of his first year in office. Following up on the state's new 21-month limit on welfare benefits to families, the shortest time limit in the nation, Mr. Rowland said today that families whose children fail to attend school should have their welfare checks withheld.
The 35-minute address was largely free of any partisan appeals. Instead, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, praised the cooperation between the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled House during the last session and said he hoped it would continue.
"What we ought to do is let the Washington spectacle be an example of what we will never tolerate as Democrats and Republicans governing here in Connecticut," he said.
To some extent, today's presentation was by its very nature unlikely to produce any dramatic new directions for the budget. Connecticut has two-year budgets, and the legislative session that convened today is intended to make needed adjustments to the budget passed last session, not chart a new course.
For the next fiscal year, which starts on July 1 and runs through June 30, 1997, Mr. Rowland proposed additional spending cuts of $72.9 million, a change of less than 1 percent from the spending outlined in the current biennial budget. If these cuts were enacted, total state spending would increase by 2.2 percent to about $10.1 billion next year, from $9.9 billion this year.
This growth in spending, while small, is a departure from last year's budget address when Mr. Rowland insisted that total state spending had to be reduced and that 31 state agencies must be consolidated into 14, ideas the Legislature largely rejected.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Rowland's budget will succeed in addressing the state's fiscal problems.
Last month, the Office of Fiscal Analysis, a nonpartisan legislative agency, projected a $224 million deficit in the next fiscal year if the state were to continue on the path set by the biennial budget. That change was largely attributable to unanticipated spending increases in social service programs and to a forecast that tax revenues would be smaller than expected because a substantial improvement in the state economy is no longer predicted.
Potentially making matters worse, Mr. Rowland's budget is based on the assumption that there will be no changes in Federal aid, changes that State Comptroller Nancy Wyman has said will cost the state at least $30 million.
Reginald L. Jones, the Governor's budget chief, defended the decision, saying it was impossible to forecast such changes. "New York State developed their budget, in contrast, for the next fiscal year based on a projection of Federal changes, and it now is facing a potential list of problems," he said, referring to Gov. George Pataki's plan to achieve more than $1.1 billion in savings in Medicaid and welfare as a result of the proposed lifting of certain Federal restrictions.
"A New York Times editorial says Governor Pataki is not sleeping too well at nights," Mr. Jones added.
The prospects for Mr. Rowland's plan to cut off welfare checks to families whose children don't attend school also was unclear. In an interview last week,, he said such a move would probably require a waiver from the Federal Government. There is no guarantee that such a waiver would be forthcoming though one was granted in Wisconsin. The proposal drew loud applause from legislators, mainly Republicans.
There are also other questions about Mr. Rowland's proposal. At the heart of his budget is a plan to privatize the state lottery and sell shares in it next year. While that sale is expected to produce about $160 million -- money needed to carry out a tax cut that takes effect next year -- Mr. Rowland has proposed borrowing money in the meantime by issuing short-term "lottery notes" on Wall Street.
That idea met a chilly reception from Moody's Investors Service, the bond-rating agency, which called them "deficit notes" and said the move could affect the state's bond rating.
William A. DiBella, the Senate Democratic Minority Leader, said today, "In order to pay for this budget, instead of selling the lottery, we're going to have to win it."
Indeed, Democrats said many of Mr. Rowland's proposed cuts and plans to increase revenues were not realistic and had been sent to the Legislature in the past and failed to win support.
Mr. Rowland's proposed cuts in social service programs also were received unenthusiastically by Democrats. A plan to save $13.5 million by eliminating rental subsidies for poor families was rejected by Thomas D. Ritter, the Speaker of the House.
Still, Mr. Ritter said that he was not displeased by Mr. Rowland's speech. "I thought the tone was good," he said. "It did not articulate many details, a lot of the ugly things, but it set the tone for reasoned discussion."

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Gap Narrows Again In Export Boom

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Strong exports and a weakening economy at home brought the nation's trade deficit to its lowest total in nearly two years in November, as the gap shrank by 13.5 percent, to $7.06 billion. It was the fifth consecutive month of improvement.
The figures, reported today by the Commerce Department, showed that the two-year boom in exports was still fueling the economy and that America's trade woes with Japan were easing. 
 But the report also provided new signs of an economy that is slowing. Not only is the rate of growth in exports slipping, but imports fell for the second consecutive month as consumers and many businesses cut back on purchases of a wide range of goods and services.
"The bottom line is that it's a good news/bad news type of story," said Michael P. Niemira, an economist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York. "The good news is that we're starting to see shrinkage in the trade gap. But the reason we're starting to see it is that the domestic economy is slowing."
Still, most economists think the trade deficit will keep falling in 1996, and that would be welcome news for President Clinton. Some of his Republican challengers have questioned his trade policies and argue that the United States needs to crack down harder on Japan and other trading partners. The President's harshest trade critic, Patrick J. Buchanan, won an upset victory in Louisiana's Republican caucuses on Tuesday; exit polls indicated that the appeal of such a message played a role.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, countered today that the latest figures showed "solid, steady progress" in bringing down both the overall trade deficit and the one with Japan, which also fell more than 13 percent in November.
"Trade is becoming an ever-increasing part of the U.S. economy," he added in an interview. "And we've got to keep playing and trying to open markets, because the alternative, hiding behind people's fears, is only a prescription for failure."
Other economists said the nation's economic growth rate would play a more critical role in election-year politics than trade results, and some said the most important question about figures like today's was whether exports would remain strong enough to keep the economy from stalling.
"The biggest challenge to Clinton is from the Republicans who are focused on economic growth, like Steve Forbes, and not from the insular, turn-your-back-on-the-world wing of the party led by Pat Buchanan," said John Ryding, senior economist with Bear, Stearns & Company in New York.
Mr. Ryding said he believed that the relatively weak dollar, and a gradual pickup in economic activity overseas, would keep American exports at a level high enough to push the economy along at a moderate clip in 1996.
But Mr. Niemira said that his bank had found in a recent survey that transportation executives expected the growth in exports to slow significantly this year as most of America's top trading partners also grappled with sluggish economies.
The Commerce Department report showed that the overall trade deficit dropped to $7.06 billion in November from a revised total of $8.16 billion in October. The November figure was the lowest monthly total since $6.5 billion in March 1994, and it represented a 38 percent drop from $11.39 billion last June.
The deficit with Japan also fell sharply in November, to $4.13 billion, the lowest level since May 1993, from $4.79 billion in October. America's deficits with two other leading trade partners -- China and Canada -- also narrowed in November.
Even with such striking improvements, today's figures suggested that the overall deficit for 1995 would total about $112 billion to $113 billion, up from $106.2 billion in 1994.
And while exports rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in November, imports dropped by seventh-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department said.
Indeed, the decline in imports accounted for nearly all of the improvement in the trade balance with Japan in November, though American exports to Japan have also risen sharply in the last year.
Most economists expect to see even steeper drops in import levels if the faltering economy makes business and consumers more wary about making major purchases during the next few months.
Indeed, the Federal Reserve reported today that consumer debt expanded at a slower pace in December, perhaps reflecting the household retrenchment that seems to be holding down demand for imported goods.
Outstanding credit swelled at a 9.3 percent annual rate in the final month of the year, compared with 11.8 percent in November and 13.7 percent in October, the Fed found.
Both automobile and revolving, or credit card, debt increased at double-digit rates. But the "other" category, which includes loans for education, boats and vacations, contracted at a 3.2 percent pace, the first decline since July and the largest since February 1995.
While a further decline in imports would signal a weakening in the economy, it would also help lower the overall trade deficit. And most economists think imports will drop enough in 1996 to cut the trade deficit to anywhere from $75 billion to $90 billion.

HEADLINE: The Trickle-Up Economy;
Poor Areas Fear a Disaster if Welfare Is Cut

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Shortly after 9 A.M., the security screens roll up at a handful of discount furniture stores at the intersection of Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. At the Krusty Bakery, coffee is sold through a bulletproof glass partition, and elsewhere, mothers roam the aisles of cut-rate clothing stores. A closed bank building has become a big billboard for a 99-cent sale. Veteran street vendors hawk hats and perfume.
The engine that drives much of the energy of this intersection's fragile mini-economy is welfare money, for more than a third of the neighborhood's residents receive public assistance. 
 For that reason, the various proposals for cutting welfare benefits now under active discussion in New York City, Albany and Washington have sent a shiver of fear through the network of shops and businesses at Nostrand and Fulton. One recent study by advocates for the poor projected that Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to cut welfare benefits would remove $33 million from the neighborhood. Whether or not the estimate is accurate, the study illustrates a a little-discussed fact: changes in welfare policy can affect local economies independently of the debate about the morality or social wisdom of welfare.
"Ross Perot would miss $33 million," noted Robert Broadnax, an employee of S & S Discount Furniture on Nostrand Avenue.
Economists and other analysts say it is difficult to measure the full economic life of a neighborhood. And so no one can really say how big a part of that economic activity stands to be erased or compromised by Mr. Pataki's proposed rollback of welfare spending.
But in this section of Bedford-Stuyvesant, where more than 40,000 of the 115,000 residents receive public assistance, where pizza parlors advertise that they accept food stamps and nearly 10 percent of the members of a local credit union make deposits from their welfare checks, no one much disputes the notion that they will feel the impact.
"Almost all of our customers are from the neighborhood," said Barbara Smith, an employee at DLW Travel. "I would think the stores in the neighborhood would be leaving if that kind of money is taken out of it."
Thomas Diaz, the manager of the Bravo supermarket on Fulton Street, is not so sure the results will be all bad if benefits are cut.
"If people can't shop, it can't be good for me," Mr. Diaz conceded. "But maybe they will change the way they have led their lives. Maybe they will work."
Mr. Diaz, though, did concede the risk. Welfare recipients, after all, are almost exclusively local customers. They generally use their limited benefits to pay rent to landlords and to spend cash at clothing outlets and grocery stores.
"They are talking about taking millions of dollars out of an already underdeveloped neighborhood," said Margo Butts, an official with the Bedford-Stuyvesant Community Conference, a local economic planning organization. "I think you have to consider, then, that what they might be talking about is economic devastation."
The recent study by a nonprofit advocacy group for the poor offers what it says is a frank formula for figuring the potential economic challenge many neighborhoods would face as a result of the state's proposed welfare reductions. Basing its projections on Mr. Pataki's plan to cut the basic welfare grant by 26.5 percent, eliminate other emergency benefits and set limits on home relief, the study by the Community Food Resource Center Inc. estimates that tens of millions of dollars will be taken from individual neighborhood economies across the city.
"We decided to take a different route from what poverty advocates usually do," said Liz Krueger, executive director of the organization. "We decided to follow the money."
Examining the city by State Assembly districts -- roughly 120,000 people live in each one -- the study calculated how many people in each district received public assistance. Then it used the state's own figures for average welfare payments to estimate how much less would be paid out to people in those districts.
As an example, in Ridgewood, Queens, a mostly working-class neighborhood, the reductions would remove $15 million in disposable income; in Washington Heights and Inwood in Manhattan, where greater numbers of welfare recipients live, the total would be more than $28 million; in the South Bronx, where more people live on public assistance than anywhere else in the city, $47 million would be gone.
But Ms. Kreuger and other economists note that it is impossible to know how large the total community economies might be, and so understand how damaging the cuts would be over all.
It is easier to see the potential effects at street level. At the intersection of Nostrand and Fulton, in a district that receives nearly $110 million in public assistance payments a year, those on welfare spend their money at telephone calling centers and in a modest mall.
"This is an all-cash economy around here," said Mark Sing, a street vendor who has sold cosmetics and scarves on Fulton Street for years. "Take that much cash out, it is going to kill me. To be honest, it feels like revenge."
Pataki administration officials, while not disputing the raw numbers, reject any implication that the reductions mean permanently lost resources. The officials say they intend to increase the state's share of food stamp allotments next year. That, they contend, will offset the damage of welfare cuts. The officials also say the measures will force people into jobs, and that private money will take over.
Mr. Pataki's first set of proposed cuts in welfare last year, put forth with some of the same arguments, died in the face of Democratic opposition. And this year's cuts are contingent, in part, on changes in welfare policy now under discussion in Washington.
Still, contended Brian Wing, the acting Commissioner for the State Department of Social Services, "those dollars can be earned back."
"People can refill the gap with work," Mr. Wing said. "The money will be lost permanently only to those people who take no steps to take care of themselves."
But that argument is the subject of dispute.
The Pataki administration says job training and development programs will be enhanced as part of the welfare reform effort. It claims that 100,000 new private jobs were created across the state last year. Legislators and other labor analysts, though, say the job gains were in fact half that number, and note that unemployment in the state rose to 6.4 percent from 5.7 percent during 1995, the Governor's first year.
In the 56th Assembly District in Bedford-Stuyvesant, only 12.8 percent of the residents 25 years or older have more than a high school education. Albert Vann, the Democratic Assemblyman who represents the 56th, said the unemployment rate for black men ages 17 to 24 is 37 percent.
"People suddenly working in this neighborhood -- that's a farce," Mr. Vann said. "There is no such job creation."
Some economic analysts say counting the welfare reductions as lost income to communities is an important way of fully appreciating the economic fallout of a policy decision. Others call it nonsense.
"We can all have biases about certain parts of the debate on welfare, but the argument that there is going to be an economic ripple effect for certain neighborhoods is real," said Russell Sykes, an official with the State Communities Aid Association, a research organization that has advocated welfare reform. "You can count on one truth: welfare benefits are spent in the neighborhood. And you are not replacing those dollars instantly."
But Abe Lackman, the former budget director for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani who is now secretary to the State Senate Finance Committee, disagreed.
"The argument that the money is drained and forever lost, by its nature, is specious," Mr. Lackman said. "The welfare money, in a sense, is coming from taxes in those neighborhoods. And so the key question people should be asking themselves is, Are they receiving proper return on their tax dollars that fund welfare and other programs?"
Still, the prospect of radical welfare reductions' damaging the city's struggling, discrete neighborhood economies has caused all sorts of people to ask questions.
At Nostrand and Fulton, most people seemed convinced of the potential peril. Joe Long, who has run Birdy's Record Shop since 1969, winced when he theorized about the loss of $33 million in his district.
"Where are we going without consumers?" he said. "It's going to be rough. If money isn't back in circulation quick, you can wrap it up here as a neighborhood by the year 2000."
Meyer Sakkal, staring out over the rows of bins of discount clothing at the Ray department store, which he manages, said the city's tightening of welfare benefits had already hurt his business.
"We've had days, he said, "where more is stolen from here than bought."

USING the investment vehicle that served them so well in the United States stock market last year -- mutual funds -- individual investors turned their attentions overseas last month, putting a record amount of money into funds that invest both here and abroad and pushing foreign markets up sharply in the process.
The broad American market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's Corporation index of 500 stocks, is up 5.5 percent this year, and yesterday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.51 points, to 5,492.14, its eighth record high in nine sessions. But other markets around the globe have recorded similar -- or better -- gains. 
 For example, Germany's DAX index has risen 8.5 percent, or 5.5 percent in United States dollars, while Mexico's Bolsa index has gained 8.3 percent, or 11.7 percent in American dollars. In the Far East, the Hang Seng index, which measures the Hong Kong stock exchange, is up 13 percent since the start of the year.
According to estimates released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, roughly $24.5 billion in net new cash flowed into domestic and international stock funds in January -- a third more than the previous one-month record of $18.3 billion, set in January 1994, and 44 percent more than in December, which was the best month of cash flows in 1995.
About half of the growth in fund flows last month went to international funds, which in 1995 lagged far behind domestic stock funds in attracting new investment. Bond funds, meanwhile, which suffered net outflows for much of last year, took in an estimated $3 billion last month, their biggest month since January 1994, when inflows totaled $11.0 billion.
The combined monthly total for stock and bond funds of $27.5 billion, up from $17.8 billion in December, was the largest net inflow to long-term mutual funds since January 1994, when funds took in $29.4 billion in new cash.
The January data are the first released by the institute under a new format of estimated cash flows it adopted this month. The preliminary estimates, which will be reported about seven business days after the end of each month, is based on a survey of mutual funds that account for about 97 percent of mutual fund assets, the institute said. Previously, the trade group has waited to report monthly cash flow data until the end of the following month, when all fund companies have compiled final results.
January is traditionally a big month for mutual fund cash flows, because of corporate payments of employee bonuses and distributions to pension and profit-sharing funds. Inflows also tend to rise in the January following a year of particularly strong performance, as occurred in the stock and bond markets in 1995, because individual investors tend to favor those investments that have already performed the best.
John Rea, chief economist at the Investment Company Institute, said international and global stock funds, which invest all or most of their assets abroad, showed particular strength last month, taking in "well over half" of the $7.5 billion increase in inflows that stock funds recorded in January over December.
If that estimate is correct, that would mean international funds took in somewhat more than $6 billion in January, which would be their biggest month since February 1994. Around the end of 1995, following two years of tough times for international investors, many market strategists predicted that overseas bourses were likely to outperform the United States stock market this year.
Mr. Rea said municipal bond funds showed little change in their recent trends, in which net flows have bounced from slightly negative to slightly positive and back again for most of the last year.
The trade group's data on mutual fund flows agree with what fund company officials have been saying for weeks -- that January was the best month for new investment they had ever seen.
Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price, said that company took in $1.6 billion in new cash in January, equivalent to nearly a third of its total net inflows for all of 1995. "We definitely saw a rebound in interest in international investing," he said. "What was a moderately positive cash flow at the end of the year picked up significantly in January."
At the Vanguard Group, more than $4 billion in net new cash surged into accounts in January, burying the company's previous best month of $2.6 billion, set in March 1993, according to Brian Mattes, a spokesman. "And February appears to be a repeat of that," he said, with $1 billion in more cash coming into funds of all types in the first week of this month.
Charles Biderman, editor of Liquidity Trim Tabs and two other newsletters based in Santa Rosa, Calif. that track cash flow and liquidity data, has been predicting for nearly a month that a surge of fresh cash into mutual funds would cause an "upside explosion" in stock prices.
Bob Adler of AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif., which also makes its own estimates of mutual fund cash flow, reported that in addition to international funds, cash has flowed most quickly in recent weeks to aggressive growth funds, which invest in the riskest category of United States stocks.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE SCENE;
Forbes? The Enemy Camp Turns Joyful

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: AMES, Iowa, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The very idea that President Clinton might eventually run against Steve Forbes and his flat-tax platform sends Margo McNabb, career Democrat, into a Joycean ecstasy of Molly Bloom dimensions.
"Yes, yes, oh, yes!" Mrs. McNabb crooned, uninhibited in the outsized joy she envisions in Mr. Clinton's going to the people and denouncing the flat tax as the ultimate measure of just how reactionary a spectacle the Republicans are presenting this year as they elbow their way through the Iowa Presidential nominating competition and beyond. 
 "And I read that Steve the Boy Wonder has a Robert Mapplethorpe print on his yacht!" added Mrs. McNabb, delightedly swirling the Mapplethorpe taboo, dear to the Republican Christian right, into the plutocrat image of Mr. Forbes that she craves to see the President set up and smash like a November pinata.
A former Democratic state committeewoman and Story County chairwoman, Mrs. McNabb has no internecine fight on her hands this year. But like most other Democrats, she is thoroughly enjoying the mixed enthusiasm and shock of Republicans at the high polling tides of the Forbes phenomenon. For fun, she concocts attack commercials that seem little more exaggerated than the dirk-and-blunderbuss appeals already blanketing this state like the season's tiresome, mud-spattered snows.
"One would open with a coupon-clipping, bonbon-eating dowager as the maid comes in," Mrs. McNabb fantasized, cackling at her imaginary 30-second spot, Bubba versus the Plutocrat. "The President would wipe up the floor with him," she concluded, asking what could be better for a Democratic candidate than reducing things to the issue of poor versus rich?
But Mr. Forbes continues to fairly mesmerize Iowa audiences with his single-theme denunciation of the Internal Revenue code, an attack that always draws on the same Dracula specter that, word for word, he first raised at his campaign opening last year. "Kill it, drive a stake through its heart, bury it and hope it never rises again to terrorize the American people!" he advises in his familiar peroration with his familiar unblinking smile of delight. He prescribes all but a clove of garlic, and inevitably audiences burst into applause at his imagery-filled message that a money-sucking "monstrosity," the graduated income tax, can be exterminated.
His stump appearances lately are more remarkable for what the audiences do not ask about the flat tax than for the dedicated repetitiousness of Mr. Forbes's performance.
There seems little voter memory of the recent history of supply-side economics. Rather, there is the fun of Mr. Forbes's fresh face looming at the center of what is the biggest clot of reeling, pushing news media gangs currently in motion in Iowa. There is the simple optimism generated by a four-piece band playing "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" at the very entrance of the $4 million Iowa candidate: a personally financed self-proclaimed nonpolitician with four times the spending power of any of his rivals, those accused politicians who somehow seem sheepish in competing under fund-raising strictures.
"I worked out the flat-tax formulas," said John Babyar, a Republican caucus-goer who nodded approvingly at Mr. Forbes's speech on Tuesday night at the library in the town of Indianola. "And his leaves me $800 richer. What's wrong with being rich? I'd like to see all Americans rich."
Mr. Forbes is counting on testimonials like Mr. Babyar's to prove stronger at the caucuses on Monday than are the increasing jabs his rivals are throwing at his family fortune. "He has 520 acres there in New Jersey, and 439 are zoned agricultural," Senator Phil Gramm tells Iowa farmers, his twang extra cynical in enumeration of the tax shelters that Mr. Forbes enjoys even as he demonizes the system. "You know what he grows on his farm? Polo ponies."
Particularly notable is the precision of Forbes rivals in their criticisms. "Even his 441-foot yacht is tax deductible," says Lamar Alexander. These knocks draw approving leers and laughter. Then again, Mr. Babyar and countless others are out there listening, appreciating a rich role model.
The Republican candidates, for all their lacerating competitiveness, touch on one strangely similar aside: China's emerging market for farm imports. Mr. Forbes hypothesizes that "if all the people in China ate two more eggs" a week, it would take "all the grain produced in a year in Australia" to feed the egg-layers. Mr. Gramm: "If everybody in China ate one more chicken a year, it would take the entire soybean crop of Illinois to feed that chicken."
Just as a listener is deciding, "That's some chicken," Mr. Alexander offers a slightly more complex hypothesis, about the Chinese eating just a bit more chicken and pork and thereby needing the entire Nebraskan grain crop to fatten the export bonanza.
After days of these crop references, a listener can pause and wonder whether this is something Oliver Stone should look into: a Chinese Menu Stump Conspiracy, with the System's irrepressibly ambitious politicians in cahoots. But no.
"Iowans aren't stupid, you know," contended Margo McNabb, stoking her reveries on the Forbes candidacy.

PATRICK J. BUCHANAN
 
From a press conference yesterday in Des Moines:
" The argument we're going to make for the rest of this campaign here in Iowa is this: Pat Buchanan is the conservative who can win this race. It is time for conservatives to unite behind him, and, I believe, carry the day in Iowa. It is time for the right-to-life movement in Iowa and New Hampshire to unite behind the one strong pro-life candidate who has a fighting chance to win the Republican nomination and to beat Bill Clinton. And let me say this: more than a fighting chance -- who has an excellent chance today to win the Republican nomination and win the election in November. 
 Finally, we're going to ask Democrats and independents to come out and help us out in the Iowa caucuses, and join this new coalition we're trying to build -- of traditional social conservatives, economic conservatives and populists, the Perot folks, the Reagan Democrats and the Republicans. "
 
BOB DOLE
 
Speaking by telephone yesterday with employees of Harvey Industries, a building-supplies manufacturer in Manchester, N.H.:
" I have got to believe the people of New Hampshire, regardless of their party, want us to do the right thing. And if we can get a good budget agreement -- President Clinton says he wants one. I know the Speaker wants one. I certainly want one. And I believe the people of New Hampshire, regardless of party, say, Grab it, take it if you get 80 percent, take 80 percent, we'll get 20 percent later when Bob Dole is President of the United States.' So that's what we are working on. "

HEADLINE: POLITICS: IN THE PACK;
Unbowed but Disappointed, Gramm Pushes On in Iowa

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Feb. 7

 BODY:
When Senator Phil Gramm returned to his chartered jet between visits to voting sites in Louisiana on Tuesday night, the stewardess, Lisa Dinsmoor, complimented him on his extensive police escort.
"Isn't it great?" exulted Mr. Gramm, who is from neighboring Texas. "I tell you, there's nothing like being back in your own country." 
 He did not know it yet -- and would not accept it even long after the first returns had come in -- but Mr. Gramm was losing in his own country, defeated by a Northerner in the Louisiana caucuses, which, only an hour before the polling precincts closed, he was still predicting he would win.
In a contest that most of the Republican Presidential field bypassed, the victor, Patrick J. Buchanan, had ridiculed Mr. Gramm's devotion to free trade and questioned the depth of his opposition to abortion. Buchanan aides in Louisiana said that by raising doubts about Mr. Gramm's anti-abortion commitment, Mr. Buchanan had been able to draw away Christian conservatives, voters who also form a powerful bloc in the Iowa caucuses next Monday.
At a rally here today, Mr. Gramm tried to reassure Iowans that he was unbowed in defeat. Speaking at the State Capitol, he never mentioned Louisiana. Instead, he delivered a rousing speech that he had scribbled during his flight from New Orleans, dwelling on social issues that he had rarely mentioned in recent weeks here: welfare, immigration, crime and, perhaps most significantly, abortion.
"Today the 1.5 million abortions that occur in our country every year represent a national disgrace and a national tragedy," he declared, "and I'm committed to remove that blot from our national character."
Addressing about 200 supporters -- who frequently interrupted him with chants of "Phil '96!" -- Mr. Gramm said he remained the logical conservative choice. "I am the only candidate," he said, "who can bring together the social conservatives and the economic conservatives and beat Bill Clinton."
Mr. Gramm's strategists had hoped that this claim would gain force with a victory in Louisiana. Instead, they acknowledged today, its power has diminished.
But rather than lick his wounds, Mr. Gramm pressed ahead, appearing on all the television networks' morning shows to acknowledge his disappointment while displaying his determination to fight on.
As he flew from Louisiana to Iowa, the Senator said he needed to finish third or higher in the caucuses here on Monday. "If I can run in the top three, we're very much in this race," he said. "If I don't run in the top three, we're out of this race. So it's clear-cut." But he declined to say he would drop out if he finished fourth or worse.
Mr. Gramm also declined to discuss in detail what had gone wrong in Louisiana. "That just too much borders on excuse-making," he said.
But he did say he believed that Senator Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner, had worked against him there and that supporters of David Duke, the former Klansman and onetime candidate for Louisiana governor, had been "a big factor" in Mr. Buchanan's success.
Mr. Gramm's campaign chairman, Charles Black, said the Gramm organization had miscalculated on several fronts.
Mr. Black said he had underestimated the turnout, as well as the high proportion of religious conservatives among caucus-goers. He also said Gramm supporters had become demoralized because the candidate had rarely visited the state. To revitalize them, the campaign renewed television commercials in the last five days. But it was too late.
"We all have egg on our faces," Mr. Black said.
Mr. Gramm said the loss would not cause him to alter his message. "I'm not going to try to deceive people about who I am and what I want to do," he said.
He said that in particular he did not intend to stop preaching free trade. "This idea promoted by Pat Buchanan and Dick Gephardt that somehow we can build a wall around America and go hide under a rock somewhere is totally unrealistic," he said.
At the rally here today, Mr. Gramm again proclaimed the virtues of free trade. But he set aside his usual stump speech in favor of themes he had struck only softly for weeks.
"Today 40 million Americans have their lives diminished by being dependent on the Federal Government," he said. "We have made mothers dependent, we have driven fathers out of the household, we have denied people access to the American dream with a welfare program that does not work."
Mr. Gramm resurrected an image he once employed frequently, drawing a distinction between Americans who "ride in the wagon" and those who pull it.
Someone who pulls, he said, "not only loves himself but loves his country and is part of it, and I want people to pull because I love them."
The Senator sketched a vision of the United States on Jan. 1, 2001, after four years of a Gramm Presidency: crime diminished, affirmative action ended, the Department of Education abolished and abortion banished.
"I know that there are those who will say that listening to Phil Gramm talk about the year 2001, it sounds an awful lot like a Norman Rockwell painting," he said. "Norman Rockwell did not paint America exactly as it was. He painted it as we wanted it to be, and as we knew it could be."

HEADLINE: Aristide Hands Power to Successor in Haiti

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 7

 BODY:
In subdued, even somber ceremonies here today, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide ended a turbulent five-year term by becoming the first elected head of state in nearly 200 years of Haitian history to peacefully transfer power to a popularly chosen successor.
To the applause of Haitian and foreign dignitaries well aware of both the significance and the high cost of his investiture by democratic means, the country's new President, Rene Garcia Preval, promised to duplicate Mr. Aristide's achievement. 
 "I swear to obey and make sure others obey the Constitution of the nation, and its laws," the new President said in taking his oath of office.
Mr. Aristide, in his last official act as President, tweaked the United States and spared Mr. Preval from taking a step that might undermine his relationship with Washington. Late Tuesday night, Haiti announced that it was re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba, broken by the dictator Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier more than 30 years ago in response to American pressure.
This morning, arriving at Parliament nearly an hour behind schedule for the swearing in, Mr. Aristide was greeted by a military band, the only remnant of the disbanded Haitian armed forces, which overthrew him in a coup in September 1991.
Afterward a small group of onlookers sang "Auld Lang Syne" and complained of Mr. Aristide's decision to step down, in keeping with a constitutional prohibition on Haitian presidents succeeding themselves in office.
"We want Titid! We want Titid!" some chanted, using Mr. Aristide's nickname. In an indication of the narrow political maneuverability and autonomy Mr. Preval may have, others shouted that they were eager for Mr. Aristide to run for president again in five years.
Today also marked the 10th anniversary of the day Jean-Claude Duvalier was toppled from power, ending a 30-year family dictatorship and ushering in a period of political instability and state-sponsored violence that concluded only with Mr. Aristide's restoration to power by 20,000 American troops in the fall of 1994.
Nevertheless, few people took to the streets to mark the occasion, in contrast to Mr. Aristide's inauguration five years ago today. And there were virtually no public festivities.
"Today doesn't really mean a lot to me, because there are still no jobs and I don't have enough to eat," said Felix Joseph, who described himself as an unemployed mason.
In his inaugural address, delivered this afternoon on the lawn of the National Palace, Mr. Preval vowed to remedy that situation, calling on Haitians to "join intelligences and unite efforts" in order to do away with "the profound inequities of our society."
The strongest public reaction, however, came in response to Mr. Preval's pledge to "restore the authority of the state," which has traditionally governed for the benefit of an elite few since Haiti became an independent nation in 1804.
In an indication of the diminishing commitment of world powers to Haiti, most of the foreign delegations attending the inauguration ceremonies were of low rank.
No heads of state attended, and United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali also stayed away. The senior foreign official present was Taiwan's Vice President, Li Juan-zu.
On earlier occasions over the last 16 months on which it wished to trumpet its Haiti venture as a foreign policy success, the Clinton Administration has been represented here by the President, Vice President Al Gore or Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
This time, however, the American delegation, which flew in this morning and departed this afternoon, was led by Madeleine K. Albright, the American representative to the United Nations.
Mr. Aristide's decision to revive relations with Cuba in the last hours of his term led to a delicate diplomatic minuet at the inaugural ceremony. Ms. Albright found herself sitting directly behind Cuba's Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina, whom she pointedly ignored. For his part Mr. Robaina, seated alongside the Taiwanese delegation, strained and shifted position in order to avoid them.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CAUCUSES;
Louisiana Catapults Buchanan Into Iowa

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
With Senator Phil Gramm thrown off stride and Patrick J. Buchanan heartened by the results of Tuesday's Louisiana caucuses, the Republican Presidential hopefuls plunged today into the final round of campaigning before the closely watched Iowa caucuses next Monday.
The Louisiana contest was an innovation this year, seized upon by Mr. Gramm, who comes from neighboring Texas, to try to gain impetus for Iowa. Only 21,500 people took part, a mere 5 percent of the Republican registration, which robbed the event of much of its luster. In a state with 4,000 precincts, there were only 42 caucus sites. 
 But the outcome, following a similar surprising reversal last week in an Alaska straw poll, hurt Mr. Gramm all the same, not least because it was he who had touted the contest's importance. In political circles, he was seen as having outsmarted himself.
Mr. Buchanan, who took 13 of the 21 delegates at stake in Louisiana, said in an interview as he flew from New Orleans to Iowa that his victory had demonstrated that "Pat Buchanan can win this nomination and put together a coalition to win the election." But most leading Republicans remained dubious. Party elders consider his diatribes against abortion, recent trade agreements and American involvement abroad too extreme for many voters.
Although Dick Bennett, a leading New Hampshire pollster, said Mr. Buchanan's victory "solidifies his position as the real conservative in the race," other professionals argued that the real significance of the outcome lay in the harm it did to Mr. Gramm rather than the help it gave to Mr. Buchanan.
New Iowa polls show a large bloc of voters still undecided, at least partly because of dismay over the negativism of the campaign. Mr. Buchanan asserted that he now has "a fighting chance" in the state if the race is still fluid enough, although he expressed concern about the millions of dollars spent on television advertising by Steve Forbes, the publishing mogul. Mr. Buchanan is one of the least well-financed candidates; he has said he can win if he is outspent 5 to 1, "but I don't know what happens if it goes to 10 to 1."
For his part, Mr. Gramm insisted in television appearances and in a speech at the Iowa Capitol that he had not been knocked out of the race, even though he took only eight delegates in Louisiana, where he and his handlers had predicted a sweep as recently as last weekend. He said his strong grass-roots organization would help him rebound in Iowa to finish at least third.
"We have a long way to go and a short time to get there," he conceded.
Overconfident, Mr. Gramm spent last week in Iowa while Mr. Buchanan sneaked up on him in Louisiana, and the commentator asserted today that he had proved he was much the strongest conservative in the race. Half the participants in the caucuses, according to an exit poll, identified themselves as members of the religious right, and they went to Mr. Buchanan by almost 2 to 1.
The poll, taken by Voter News Service, a consortium of the networks and The Associated Press, showed Mr. Buchanan winning handily among older voters, foes of abortion and those who called themselves very conservative. The pattern of returns, with Mr. Buchanan running strongly in the heavily Catholic parishes of southwestern Louisiana, the Cajun country, suggested that he was helped by his own Catholicism.
Alan Keyes, the third active candidate in Louisiana, won no delegates.
Neither Senator Bob Dole nor Mr. Forbes competed in the state, which Mr. Gramm had recently called "a race to determine the true conservative in the field." They are considered the front-runners in Iowa, whose caucuses mark the quasi-official opening of the nominating process, and in New Hampshire, whose first-in-the-nation primary comes eight days later, on Feb. 20.
Compounding Mr. Gramm's problems, he has been counting on Christian conservatives to help power his operation on caucus night in Iowa. The movement there is already divided among Mr. Gramm, Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Dole, and defections from Mr. Gramm to Mr. Buchanan would hurt. If Mr. Gramm finishes fourth in the Midwest, he conceded today, he will be done for.
Even a third-place finish would be problematical, given his weakness in New Hampshire, where he has attracted little support either among political professionals or rank-and-file voters. Mr. Gramm's hopes had seemed to depend on his doing well enough early to survive until the contests in the Southern states come up, starting with the South Carolina primary on March 2. But his setback in Louisiana cast doubt on his potential all across that region.
The Texan has also run into trouble in Arizona, according to politicians there. Backed by the popular Senator John McCain, Mr. Gramm managed to get the primary date there set for Feb. 27, and had predicted that he would sweep the state. But Mr. Forbes has mounted a $2 million advertising blitz.
Mr. Gramm dismissed criticism from Mr. Dole and Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, who faulted him for missing a Senate vote on the farm bill on Tuesday. Needing 60 votes to move the bill to the floor, the Republicans could muster only 59. Mr. Lugar, also a Presidential candidate, is chairman of the Agriculture Committee and Mr. Dole is the majority leader; Mr. Gramm said the vote had been timed to embarrass him and complained of "petty politics."
"Everyone knew what the vote was and everyone knew its importance," Mr. Lugar said, and Mr. Gramm's failure to appear for it was criticized by some farm officials in Iowa, one of the nation's leading agricultural states.
Mr. Buchanan, who four years ago ran for the Republican nomination against President George Bush, has been considered a rank outsider in this year's race. In the early polls he consistently languished in the single digits. But Louisiana, he said, "was perfect for us, because it's a state where my message resonates."
Specifically, he said he had scored with his message of "economic patriotism" -- his charge that President Clinton had "sold out our workers" in negotiating and signing the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Buchanan ran more strongly among those without college degrees and among lower-income voters, according to the exit poll, in which 1,389 caucus-goers took part. He said on CBS News this morning that he had done "tremendously well" among "the working people that we need to bring back to our party to defeat Bill Clinton."

HEADLINE: On Social Policy, Governors Quietly Split the Difference

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The welfare and Medicaid proposals endorsed by the nation's governors this week lack detail and have a long way to go if they are ever to become law. But if approved, such changes would revolutionize social policy by shifting large amounts of money and decision-making power to the states.
It is not surprising that governors would recommend changes that enhance their own authority. What is surprising is what they have accepted in exchange: a continuation of many Federal standards and requirements. 
 Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia who chronicled the transformation of governors from political hacks to professional managers in a 1978 book, "Goodbye to Good-Time Charlie," said: "Governors are can-do executives. What they've done in the last few days proves that they can get together across party lines and reach compromises that seem to elude the political actors in Washington. I think the governors made both President Clinton and Congress look very petty, very political and also ineffective."
For the last 60 years, social welfare policy has been built on the concept of entitlement: the idea that certain people have political, legal and moral rights to certain types of help from the Federal Government.
Many Democrats want to retain this framework. But in an effort to decentralize power and control costs, Republicans now seek profound changes in it. They want to give each state a lump sum of Federal money, a block grant, to design and operate its own programs of aid to the poor.
In policy statements approved on Tuesday, the National Governors' Association tried to split the difference between entitlements and block grants, giving states more flexibility while preserving Federal guarantees.
Whether such a hybrid is feasible remains to be seen. The very features that appeal to the governors outrage liberal advocates for the poor, who tend to distrust state officials.
Here is a description of some of the changes the governors have endorsed:
The governors' proposal on welfare would eliminate the Federal guarantee of assistance to needy children. Instead, each state would receive a fixed amount of Federal money to help the poor.
States would have "broad discretion in the design of their programs." Poor people now entitled to cash assistance would not necessarily receive it in the future.
States would lose up to 5 percent of their Federal money if they failed to meet Federal standards for placing welfare recipients in jobs or training programs. States could cut off benefits for people who refused to work. In general, families could not receive Federal welfare benefits for more than five years. States could exempt 20 percent of welfare families from the five-year limit and could set stricter time limits if they wanted.
Under current law, there is no time limit. Many families receive welfare for more than five years, and Federal welfare spending increases automatically when more people need assistance -- in a recession or after a hurricane, for example.
The governors' proposal has no mechanism for such automatic adjustments, but would establish a $2 billion contingency fund to help states with high unemployment or increased rates of child poverty.
States could reduce their own welfare spending by 25 percent without losing any Federal money. The governors' proposal would require states to spend 75 percent of what they spent in 1994 for cash assistance, child care, education, job training and work programs for welfare recipients.
The governors' proposal could end cash benefits for one-fourth of the one million children under 18 who receive Supplemental Security Income because of physical or mental disabilities. The governors would establish a stricter, narrower test of disability, based mainly on medical evidence rather than on a comprehensive assessment of each child's ability to perform ordinary daily activities like eating and dressing.
 
Medicaid
The governors' proposal would guarantee health care for many -- but not all -- of the children, elderly people and pregnant women who are now covered. Each state would receive a lump sum of Federal money to finance such care. But hospitals and nursing homes might be less willing to care for Medicaid patients because the Federal law guaranteeing "reasonable and adequate" reimbursement would be repealed. States would have complete authority to set Medicaid payment rates for health plans, doctors and hospitals.
Detailed Federal standards for nursing homes, set by Congress in 1987, would stay on the books. But states would decide how they should be enforced. "You could have very strong national standards, but no teeth behind them," said Martin A. Corry, director of Federal affairs for the American Association of Retired Persons, who asserted that "states did a poor job of enforcement before 1987."
The governors specify a package of benefits that would be available to Medicaid recipients. But states would have complete freedom to limit the "amount, duration and scope of services," thus restricting the number of doctors' visits and hospital days for which Medicaid would pay. States would still have to screen poor children for medical problems, but would no longer have to cover all medically necessary care. They could cut back coverage of eyeglasses, hearing aids, dental care, mental health care and prescription drugs.
More generally, the governors' proposal would guarantee Medicaid for poor children through the age of 12. It would, in effect, repeal a 1990 law that eventually guarantees Medicaid coverage for poor children from the age of 13 through 18.
The Federal Government and the states now share the cost of Medicaid. The governors' proposal would reduce the fiscal burden on states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where per-capita income is relatively high. Those states would pay 40 percent of Medicaid costs, rather than the current 50 percent.
States could once again finance their share of Medicaid by imposing special taxes on hospitals. Congress severely restricted the use of such taxes in 1991 after finding that states used them in fund-raising swindles: Hospitals typically got back much more than they paid, and Washington bore most of the cost.
 
Nutrition
The governors would keep food stamps as an entitlement program, financed entirely by the Federal Government. But their proposals would cut projected spending by $25 billion over seven years. The cuts average 12 percent, but are deeper in later years, reaching 17 percent in the year 2002.
The governors would allow states to take their food stamp money in the form of a block grant if they took steps to curtail fraud by issuing all benefits electronically, with debit cards instead of coupons.
Under current law, food stamps increase automatically when a person's income declines, offsetting the effects of reductions in cash assistance. Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group, said that one of the governors' proposals would allow states to link the two programs so that "food stamp benefits for welfare families would be frozen if the state instituted an across-the-board reduction" in cash assistance. In other words, their food stamp benefits would not rise, even if they received less income from welfare.
The governors would preserve the school lunch program as an entitlement for children, but would allow seven states to take part of the Federal money, for administrative expenses, in the form of block grants. Presumbaly, these states could eliminate much of the paperwork now required.
 
Child Protection
Under current law, the Federal Government helps pay for foster care and adoption of poor children who have been abused or neglected. The governors would keep these payments as an "open-ended entitlement," but would allow states to use some of the money for programs intended to prevent child abuse and neglect.
States want additional flexibility. But Mary Lee Allen, an expert on child welfare programs at the Children's Defense Fund, said it was "unclear whether the governors would guarantee continued aid for every child now entitled to foster care and adoption assistance."
 
Outlook
Congressional leaders of both parties promise to give serious attention to the governors' proposals, and President Clinton welcomed them without endorsing them.
Lawmakers say the chances for enactment of the proposals this year are probably less than 50-50. But the governors' unanimous support for the proposals signals a political turning point. Democratic governors are now on record in favor of major changes in antipoverty programs, to the dismay of their usual allies.
Edward M. Cooney, deputy director of the Food Research and Action Center, an advocacy group for low-income families, said, "We are very disappointed in Democratic governors who agreed to a reformulated version of what the President has already vetoed."
But Mr. Sabato, the political scientist, said: "The governors' plan would be perfectly acceptable to most Americans. Many public opinion surveys show that people have more trust in state government than in the Federal Government."

HEADLINE: Harvard Lures Scholar to Join a 'Dream Team' on Social Policy

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. Feb. 7

 BODY:
William Julius Wilson, the sociologist whose writings on race, class and poverty have influenced policy makers, including President Clinton, has taken a top appointment at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
Professor Wilson, one of the country's leading sociologists, has taught sociology and public policy at the University of Chicago since 1972. He will also join Harvard's Department of Afro-American Studies, the university said in its announcement today. 
 He is the author of several books, including "The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass and Public Policy," published in 1987, a pioneering work that reshaped academic thinking and government policy on race and urban poverty.
Professor Wilson joins a department that includes Cornel West, the author of "Race Matters," one of America's most prominent black intellectuals. The chairman of the department is Henry Louis Gates Jr., the literary critic. Professor Gates has rebuilt the department, which just five years ago had only one professor and one student majoring in Afro-American studies. "It was near death," Professor Gates said. The department has since raised $6.2 million, and this year 40 students have chosen Afro-American studies as their concentration.
"This is a major moment in the history of Afro-American studies," Professor Gates said today. "Along with the appointment of Cornel West, William Julius Wilson's appointment positions us to take a major place in public policy analysis." And, he added, "For me, it's like being coach of the dream team."
Another prominent sociologist, Prof. Lawrence Bobo of the University of California at Los Angeles, a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation, in New York City, said that with today's appointment, "Harvard is far and away now the pre-eminent institution for the study of African-American experience."
In a telephone interview, Professor Wilson, 60, who has been named the Malcolm Wiener Professor of Social Policy at the Kennedy School, said today, "Harvard now has a community of scholars working on national public policy issues the likes of which you haven't seen anywhere."
His decision to leave the University of Chicago was "very, very difficult," he said. What prompted it, he said, was his concern about the direction in which he sees the country heading, and his belief that Harvard would provide "an outstanding forum" for scholars like himself.
"Cornel and I are both progressive," he said, referring to Professor West. "We're both liberals. We're both committed to addressing the problems of inequality."
Professor Wilson also becomes a member of the board of directors of Harvard's 21-year-old W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research, one of the oldest black research institutes in the country -- of which Professor Gates is director.
"We're going to build our public policy thinking around him," Professor Gates said.
Professor Wilson has written that not just issues involving race, but also broader economic and political changes created the growing urban underclass.

HEADLINE: CHINA SOLD PARTS FOR NUCLEAR ARMS, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
China secretly sold nuclear-weapons technology to Pakistan last year and could face the loss of billions of dollars in business deals under United States law, Administration officials said today. But, they said, President Clinton may waive the penalties to ease tensions with Beijing.
China sold Pakistan magnets used to refine bomb-grade uranium, the Central Intelligence Agency told the Administration late last year. State Department officials said today they had concluded that the evidence regarding the magnets was strong enough to trigger the penalties. 
 "We regard it as very serious," said a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The next question is what do we do about it.
"We're going to find that the Chinese have acted in violation of our own laws," he predicted, adding that the White House had not yet made a formal decision.
The sale China made would violate a 1994 law instructing the President to suspend United States Export-Import Bank financing to nations that sell nuclear-weapons information and technology.
But the White House can waive the penalties by weighing the alternatives and making a formal finding that sanctions would go against the national interest.
If the President does not waive the penalties, the United States would have to suspend nearly $10 billion in loan guarantees for American corporations doing business in China.
If he does waive them, arms-control advocates said today, he will leave the impression that American business interests in China outweigh the threat posed by the spread of nuclear arms.
Imposing penalties would deepen tensions between Washington and Beijing over economic, diplomatic, military, commercial and human-rights issues, State Department officials said. Failing to impose them "will make the world a more dangerous place," said Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat on the House intelligence committee who follows Chinese arms sales.
The Administration is in a tug-of-war with itself over China policy. While it wants to continue its multi-billion-dollar business dealings with Beijing, it must also respect American laws calling for restrictions on economic assistance and trade with nations secretly selling the technology of mass destruction.
The issue is made trickier by the Administration's threat to impose more than $1 billion in trade sanctions on Beijing for its piracy of American compact discs, computer software and videotapes. The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, told Chinese officials last week that they must abide by promises to stop pirating or face 100 percent trade tariffs on imports.
These tensions are aggravated by China's military and political maneuvers aimed at influencing presidential elections next month in Taiwan, the seat of the Nationalist Government that fled China's mainland in 1949 after losing to Communist forces.
The C.I.A.'s warning that China sold 5,000 ring magnets to a state-run nuclear-weapons laboratory in Pakistan last year was first reported on Monday by The Washington Times.
In the past, arms-control advocates and intelligence officials said, the State Department, seeking to accommodate China, not antagonize it, has overlooked compelling evidence that Beijing was violating weapons-proliferation laws and agreements.
"The State Department has put its head in the sand and refused to acknowledge the continuous pattern of violations by the Chinese in clandestine exports of nuclear, chemical and missile technology to Iran and Pakistan," said Gary Milhollin, a weapons-technology expert who runs the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Senior United States Navy officers said last week that Iran had tested a sea-based cruise missile acquired from China.
The Commerce Department has also argued against sanctions. In 1994, it approved exports to China of about $1 billion worth of technology that can be used in developing nuclear weapons, the Wisconsin Project reported in testimony to Congress in October.
Sanctions against China for weapons-technology sales have been imposed in the past, but they have not stuck.
In 1991, the C.I.A. caught China shipping components for missiles to Pakistan, which has continuous nuclear tensions with its neighbor, India. The Bush Administration suspended United States missile technology sales to the two Chinese state companies that shipped the components. The ban was lifted less than a year later after China pledged to follow an international accord, the Missile Technology Control Regime.
But by 1993, the C.I.A. again was reporting that the Chinese were shipping missile components to Pakistan. Such reports can be based on images collected by satellites, electronic eavesdropping, foreign spies or even a copy of a bill of lading supplied by a friendly shipping agent.
Responding to the report, the United States blocked the sale of $500 million of communications satellites and satellite technology to Beijing. Today the sanctions were lifted, and President Clinton approved selling the satellites.
Ms. Pelosi, who has used her seat on the intelligence committee to keep track of the issue, said today she was disappointed and puzzled by the Administration's approach.
"It's hard to understand why the U.S. wants to appear weak to the Chinese as regards our laws on nuclear weapons proliferation," she said. "There is a clear, verifiable transfer of nuclear and missile technology to Pakistan here. And the Administration has chosen a course that the Chinese can view as folding. If we ever stood up to the Chinese in terms of trade issues, human rights or proliferation, we would be in a less dangerous situation now."

HEADLINE: Ralph I. Straus, 92, Adviser to Government

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Ralph I. Straus, a prominent New York City merchant and philanthropist and a frequent consultant to the Federal Government on foreign economic policy, died on Monday in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 92.
He died after a fall, his wife, Katherine, said. 
Mr. Straus, who was born in Red Bank, N.J., attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., and Harvard, where he received a bachelor's degree and an M.B.A.
After graduating from Harvard in 1927, he formally joined R. H. Macy & Company, which was built by his great-grandfather, Bernard Straus.
From 1928 to 1941 Mr. Straus held several positions at Macy's, including corporate secretary, member of the executive committee and director. During that period, he was also active in charitable affairs organized by New York retailers, including the Greater New York Fund.
Mr. Straus's Government service began in April 1941, when he was named a consultant to the administrator of export control. After the United States entered World War II, he served with the Board of Economic Warfare, the War Production Board and the Allied Military Government in Italy as Military Governor of Naples.
After the war, instead of returning to retailing, Mr. Straus divided his time between numerous charitable and civic pursuits as well as the promotion and development of free trade. In 1950, he was appointed special assistant to W. Averell Harriman, who was then a roving ambassador, to head up a trade promotion section for the countries receiving aid under the Marshall Plan.
Mr. Straus then served as a consultant or director of a wide variety of organizations devoted to trade, including a stint in the mid-1950's as vice chairman and treasurer of the National Trade Committee. In 1968 he was named by President Lyndon B. Johnson to a 34-member public committee to recommend improvements in the nation's foreign trade.
Mr. Straus's charitable interests included the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which he served as president and board member. He was a trustee of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and served as a director of the 1964/1965 New York World's Fair.
Mr. Straus and Mrs. Straus maintained homes in Carefree, Ariz., and Southampton, L.I. His first marriage, to the former Matilda Bradfor Day, ended in divorce.
In addition to his wife, the former Katherine Mulvane Maffit, Mr. Straus is survived by two sons, Thomas P., of Rye, N.Y., and Bradford, of Winthrop, Mass.; eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

HEADLINE: From Mr. Spud to Mr. Chips;
The Potato Tycoon Who Is the Force Behind Micron

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho

 BODY:
From practically anywhere in this city, you can see the mansion on the hilltop, with its 100-foot flagpole stabbing the sky. Up there, anyone can tell you, lives Jack Simplot, the billionaire who has dominated the local economy for seven decades and is responsible for the jobs of more than 14,000 people in this part of America.
He has also been embroiled in one of the oddest melodramas in the computer industry: the recent ouster, and reinstatement eight days later, of the chairman and chief executive of the chip maker Micron Technology Inc. 
 It is an episode that still defies comprehension. But it is perhaps best understood as the latest installment in the saga of a patriarchal 20th-century industrialist, a life story that might read like the script treatment for a TV series like "Dallas" or "Dynasty" -- if it did not happen to be true.
Celebrated in Boise as a living legend, 87-year-old John R. Simplot, describes himself as "an old potato farmer" and drives a white Lincoln Town Car with "MR SPUD" on its license plates. Still vigorous, he skis, plays cards with his buddies and, above all, does deals.
Always one to seize the opportunities presented by each era's technological marvels, Mr. Simplot got his start in 1923 at the age of 14. After storming out of his father's house in a huff, young Jack set himself up as a hog farmer. His break came during a harsh winter, when feed grain was in short supply, but potato scraps and wild horse meat were plentiful. He adapted the latest boiler technology into a rendering vat that produced a fortified hog slop. The next spring, when his competitors led their scrawny survivors to market, Jack Simplot made a killing with his fat hogs.
From this start evolved the J. R. Simplot Company, now one of the largest private enterprises in the country, with interests in farming, food processing, mining and transportation and annual sales of $2.5 billion. And then, in 1980, at age 71, in what must be one of the greatest second acts in business history, Mr. Simplot decided to help a pair of local businessmen -- twin brothers, who against all odds, wanted to make computer chips here in the heart of potato country.
Having yet again seized an era's technological moment, Mr. Simplot today is the single-largest shareholder in Micron Technology, one of the world's most efficient makers of the memory chips found in computers and other electronic devices. The 22 percent of the company's shares he controls is worth $1.8 billion.
"We make the best dang digits in the world," he bellowed in a recent interview in his corner office atop one of the nondescript office towers on Main Street. He was referring to Micron's chips and, though he himself does not own a personal computer, sounded like an avid reader of Wired magazine. "We're going to digitize the world," he declared.
Assuming, that is, that Micron's stock can pull out of the nose dive that has seen the shares plummet from more than $94 last September.
[After rising $4.25 on Tuesday, the shares pulled back on Wednesday, closing at $41.125, off 62.5 cents, on volume of more than 20 million shares on the Big Board, where it was the most active issue.]
As the man who pulls the strings at Micron, Mr. Simplot has the self-made man's deep-set ideas about how businessmen should demonstrate their commitment to an enterprise -- even if Micron is a publicly held corporation and Mr. Simplot has spent the bulk of his career running his own private empire.
These attitudes were apparently at play in January, when Steve Appleton, Micron's 35-year-old chairman and chief executive, was dismissed by the board and then rehired little more than a week later.
Although Mr. Appleton and Micron have yet to offer any more than the vaguest of explanations, people familiar with the circumstances say the incident involved a clash of personalities on Micron's board, which has been dominated by Mr. Simplot and two other wealthy farmers.
The uprising is said to have been fomented by one of those farmers, Allen T. Noble, 66, who had had long championed young Tyler Lowrey, Micron's 42-year-old vice chairman and chief technologist, who is responsible for the company's edge in semiconductor production.
Mr. Noble apparently learned that Mr. Appleton was about to sell some Micron shares, a move that would be anathema to Mr. Simplot, who is known for holding on to his Micron stock. Though there is no evidence that Mr. Appleton has sold his stock recently, people say Mr. Simplot was outraged.
But soon after the low-key Mr. Lowrey was named to succeed Mr. Appleton, he himself asked the board to bring the executive back. Several other members of the management team also turned up the pressure by threatening to quit.
Mr. Noble denied that he had been the cause of the rift, saying that the board decided unanimously both to accept Mr. Appleton's resignation and to bring him back. But in an interview, his affection for Mr. Lowrey was clear. "Tyler is to me like flesh and blood, even more so," Mr. Noble said, tears welling in his eyes. "He's an unusual person."
[On Monday, Mr. Noble, who owns two million Micron shares, resigned from the Micron board, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his sick wife and daughter.]
Mr. Simplot declines to discuss details, other than to say: "Noble pulled a bad one. I put it back together." If only the fissures in his personal empire were as easy to patch.
Mr. Simplot's first wife, Ruby, the mother of his four children, left him for her best friend's husband in 1946. A decade later, Mr. Simplot married his current wife, Esther, who was an opera singer.
Two years ago, at 85, Mr. Simplot passed the reins of the J. R. Simplot Company to an office of the chairman, comprising three of his children and a grandchild. According to the company, the idea was Mr. Simplot's. But people close to the family said that the billionaire was pushed out by his youngest son, Scott, 49, who controls slightly more than a quarter of Simplot's voting stock.
The elder Mr. Simplot said that he had agreed to give his son the larger share of the stock if he would run the business. But after spending some time at the company as a vice president, Scott, who has an M.B.A. from Wharton, showed little interest in following in his father's footsteps.
"He's smarter than I am," Mr. Simplot said of Scott, barely concealing his disappointment. "He doesn't want to work that hard."
Within the family, the billionaire does not appear to have any other suitable candidates. His eldest son, Richard, who battled an alcohol problem, died of diabetes in 1993. Richard's son, Ted Simplot, 40, now represents that wing of the family in the office of the chairman.
Don, Mr. Simplot's next child, 60, who serves on Micron's board, has been involved in several failing business ventures as well as marriages. A daughter, Gay, 51, who is divorced from Idaho's Lieutenant Governor, C. L. (Butch) Otter, has been more of the public face of the company in recent years but does not have much business experience.
Scott Simplot, who is divorced with two grown daughters, declined a request for an interview. But his father expressed confidence that one day his younger son would step up to the plate. "He'll work when he has to," he said.
His troubles with Scott are a sad reprise of Mr. Simplot's difficulties with his own father.
After an argument one day in 1923, when his father refused to let him attend a basketball game, Jack Simplot, packed his bags. More than 70 years later, that headstrong 14-year-old young man is now a headstrong octogenarian.
Micron has to be one of Mr. Simplot's biggest long shots. The company was founded in 1978 by Ward and Joe Parkinson, twins born in Blackfoot, Idaho. Many people thought the brothers were crazy to try to make semiconductors in Idaho. In 1980, Mr. Simplot joined three other local investors in backing the venture, but as the company struggled his stake increased.
Micron, which went public in 1984, finally hit it big three years ago when demand for its memory chips began to rise. While memory chip prices usually fall quickly, a shortage kept prices high at a time when Micron was one of the few suppliers. Profits soared. Lately, however, with new memory-chip factories springing up around the world, analysts have been forecasting an eventual glut that will plunge companies like Micron into a fierce price war.
Throughout its many early years of losses, the company was sustained by its devoted board, which was made up of management, the four original investors and other local businessmen.
But the lack of any directors from outside the small Boise business community has made for some unusual dynamics. Two years ago, a long-simmering feud between Mr. Simplot and Joe Parkinson, then Micron's chief executive, flared into a formal confrontation.
At a board meeting in September 1994 Mr. Parkinson, now 50, accused Mr. Simplot of leaking inside information -- a accusation he denied -- and moved that he be removed from the next slate of directors. When no one seconded his motion, Mr. Parkinson and two other top executives resigned.
And so, in January, when young Mr. Appleton was let go, then reeled back, by the old boys in Boise, some financial analysts saw it as another example of the local money men running this publicly held company as they do their private fiefs.
At the company's annual meeting on Jan. 29, three days after Mr. Appleton's return was announced, Mr. Simplot gave the executive a ringing endorsement and assured shareholders that the board had things all worked out.
And though Mr. Noble may have bowed out, Mr. Simplot has no intention of leaving the Micron board anytime soon. "It's my baby, I guess," he said. "I'm going to stick with it as long as I can."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about Jack Simplot, the Idaho billionaire who is the largest shareholder in Micron Technology Inc., referred incorrectly in some editions to his action at the company's September 1994 board meeting. Mr. Simplot remained a director of Micron; he did not resign.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Drop by 21,000

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The number of first-time claims for jobless benefits dropped by 21,000 last week, continuing to fall from heights reached in the aftermath of the January blizzard.
The Labor Department said today that new applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 368,000, down from a revised 389,000 the previous week, when they fell by 23,000. The Jan. 27 total was originally estimated at 388,000. 
 The latest number was the lowest since 316,000 new claims were filed in the week of Jan. 13.
Claims had jumped by 96,000, to 412,000, in the week that ended Jan. 20. Analysts attributed the steep increase to filings that had been delayed when winter snowstorms closed many claims offices.
The four-week moving average of new claims fell by 6,500, to 371,250 from 377,750.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
A Forbes in Our Future?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
A political analyst said the other day with a certain awe in his voice: "You know, Forbes really could be the nominee. And if he is willing to pop $40 million of his own money in the six weeks before Election Day, he could be President."
It sounds like the next anonymous novel, and it is not fantasy. Bob Dole and the other Republicans know now that Steve Forbes is for real. He even has possibilities in the New York primary, despite all the machinations of Senator Alfonse D'Amato. 
 Mr. Forbes deserves a good deal of intellectual credit for breaking through the field. He offered voters what it turns out many of them wanted: an outsider with genuinely different ideas. But he was able to do that effectively only because of money -- his own. And that raises profound concerns.
On the economy, Mr. Forbes has shown that the public wants to hear something else than the whining monotone of budget-balancing that Newt Gingrich and his colleagues sang and President Clinton mimicked.
Though he has not exactly come out and said this, Mr. Forbes plainly believes that an expanding economy is more important than a balanced Federal budget. If he gets even braver, he might tell people the truth that all government budgets must be unbalanced some of the time -- that the issue is reasonable control of the deficit, not absolute balance.
Unfortunately, the Big Idea offered by Mr. Forbes to make the economy grow faster -- the flat tax -- is out of the Land of Oz. In the form he proposes, a 17 percent tax rate with no deductions, it would either land the Federal Government with a deficit out of control or force it to stop Social Security, Medicare or most essential services.
His tax talk has gone from irresponsible to pie in the sky. "We should not stop at 17," he said in New Hampshire this week. "Once the American economy is moving again, I want to reduce the rate further and further and further. We won't get it to zero emissions, you might say, but that wouldn't be a bad goal."
Though he has made himself the flat-tax candidate, Mr. Forbes does in fact stand for something more. His past statements on social issues paint him as a libertarian, opposed to the repressive ideas of the Christian right. In a Republican Party increasingly dominated by fundamentalists, that is a striking difference, and one with considerable appeal. On abortion, he has supported only modest restraints on women's right to choose, such as barring late-term abortions. He has opposed cutbacks on legal immigration. He has called the demand for a two-year limit on any family's receiving welfare a sham, because "we are not going to let a young mother and her children freeze and starve on the streets."
On the campaign trail in recent weeks Mr. Forbes has tried to make some gestures to the Christian right. For example, he used to say that he would not change the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for homosexuals in the military. Now he says that he will change it as President if the military asks him to. Even so, he comes on as less of a social conservative than other Republicans.
Money is the worrying question about Steve Forbes. Do we really want to let a rich man buy his way into the Presidency?
He has run almost 100 30-second television spot advertisements a day on Boston stations seen in New Hampshire -- and many radio spots too. In the last three months of 1995 he spent $14 million of his own money in his campaign for the nomination.
Some New Hampshire citizens, questioned in polls, say they like the fact that Mr. Forbes is rich because it means he will not try to make money out of governing. That is not an unusual feeling in American history. Franklin Roosevelt, among others, was trusted by ordinary people as a patrician. But he did not overwhelm elections with his own money.
Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, has introduced a constitutional amendment to overrule the 1976 Supreme Court decision that limiting what a candidate may spend on himself violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. Reform of that or some other kind will become irresistible if Steve Forbes and his money continue to skew the election process.

HEADLINE: In America;
Politics of Meanness

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
You have to wonder about the Republicans. From what region of exceedingly bad karma did they recruit their latest crop of Presidential candidates and Congressional leaders?
The party is dominated by characters like Phil Gramm, Pat Buchanan, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and Alfonse D'Amato. When they gallop across the national landscape they remind you of the Wild Bunch. You couldn't extract a half-pint of compassion from the entire assemblage. Small children run at the first sight of them. 
 An editorial in The Boston Herald said Mr. Dole's candidacy may ultimately be saved by "the cannibalism among his rivals." Pat Buchanan, in an interview with the paper, compared criticism of him by Phil Gramm to attacks on Eliot Ness by Al Capone.
Senator Dole used to stand virtually alone among national politicians in his willingness to be unabashedly mean in public. As Gerald Ford's running mate and designated hatchet man in 1976 he denounced the Democrats for being the party of war, growling, "If we added up all the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century, it would be about 1.6 million Americans, enough to fill the city of Detroit."
But Mr. Dole has mellowed. And it's a measure of how mean politics has become, especially Republican politics, that he has been surpassed in orneriness by many of his fellow party members. (Mr. Dole has his own hatchet man in Senator D'Amato, who, as chairman of the Whitewater Committee, has been given a job for which, by talent and temperament, he is perfectly suited -- full-time tormentor of the First Lady.)
The politics of meanness is sinking the Republican Party, which seemed unassailable just months ago. The movement toward Steve Forbes is based primarily on the fact that so many voters are without a clue as to who he is. They just know he's somebody else. A woman who shifted her support from Senator Dole to Mr. Forbes told Time magazine, "Can't say exactly why except that he has some very good ideas -- although I can't tell you exactly what they are right now."
Mr. Forbes, who has purchased a huge amount of name recognition, has been trying to look like Mr. Nice Guy. That won't last. Viciousness is deeply embedded in his campaign. In any event, Mr. Forbes is not likely to be carried into the White House on a tax plan that is guaranteed to help him and hammer the middle class.
So where does that leave voters, who have already demonstrated their disenchantment with the Democrats and Bill Clinton?
"There's a real restlessness and grumpiness that's out there," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute of Public Opinion. "People are lurching about because the leadership isn't there. It goes back to '92 and the rejection of George Bush, and then the rejection of Clinton in '94, and an hour and a half later the rejection of Gingrich."
American voters are crying out, but for the most part the politicians are not listening. Mr. Miringoff said he was "absolutely struck" by the economic concerns expressed by respondents to his latest poll. The equivalent of one-third of all American workers are worried that someone in their household will lose a job in the next year, he said. The poll shows that more than 100 million Americans are worried that their total family income is not enough to meet expenses. At the same time, the cost of health insurance is going up and payroll benefits are going down.
"we're talking about huge numbers of people who are hurting," said Mr. Miringoff. But these issues are not being widely discussed in a campaign season that he described as "dismal."
The Republicans, especially, are ill equipped to respond to people in economic distress. Huge numbers of Americans who bought into the hoopla surrounding the Contract With America were dismayed to wake up and find that not only were they no better off financially, but they were unwittingly supporting attacks on Medicare, Medicaid, student loans, school lunches, workplace safety, the environment, etc.
It's anybody's guess where the voters will lurch next. The Republicans could win with a candidate who is cheerful, moderate and willing to exhibit a dollop of compassion. Maybe they should draft Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: Justice Department Approves L'Oreal Bid for Maybelline

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
L'Oreal S.A., the French cosmetics giant, received approval yesterday from the Justice Department for its acquisition of Maybelline Inc., clearing the way for the $758 million buyout.
The approval was the last barrier to the sale of Maybelline, the maker of mass-market cosmetics sold through drug and discount stores. The purchase of Maybelline, based in Memphis, would give L'Oreal, which sells Lancome and other higher-priced cosmetics, a broader presence in American stores. 
 L'Oreal's tender offer of $44 a share for Maybelline stock ends at 5 P.M. today. Shares of Maybelline rose 37.5 cents, to $44 yesterday.
Joh. A. Benckiser G.m.b.H., a German cosmetics company that made a rival bid of $42 a share, repeated yesterday that it would not top L'Oreal's bid. Benckiser had said that it might come back with a bid for Maybelline, but only if L'Oreal failed to receive approval from American antitrust officials.
Already, about seven million shares, or 49 percent, of Maybelline's outstanding shares have been tendered to L'Oreal. The largest single Maybelline shareholder is Wasserstein Perella & Company, the New York investment bank, which held nearly 30 percent of the company and whose executives hold key positions on Maybelline's board.
In late December, Wasserstein entered into a binding agreement with L'Oreal to sell its Maybelline shares only to the French company. That put a large block of shares into L'Oreal's hands, but did not discourage Benckiser from entering the fray and forcing L'Oreal to increase its bid from an original $36.75 a share.
L'Oreal's $758 million purchase price for Maybelline includes slightly more than $600 million in equity and the assumption of roughly $150 million in debt. The final offer is about $100 million higher than L'Oreal's original bid. It also increases the amount Wasserstein Perella will receive for its shares -- the firm is now expected to receive around $170 million.
Guy Peyrelongue, the chief executive of Cosmair, L'Oreal's American subsidiary, said that the higher price L'Oreal offered was offset by a decline in interest rates since last summer, when L'Oreal first began to estimate how much a Maybelline acquisition would cost.
"When we made our first studies last June, we had a cost of financing that used interest rates significantly higher than today," he said. "Even at $44 a share, with the drop in interest rates, Maybelline won't cost us more than what we anticipated last June."
Mr. Peyrelongue said that Maybelline would operate as a separate division of Cosmair, which already has several American divisions including Lancome and Redken hair care products. He has no plans to change Maybelline's management, marketing or sales operations.
"We feel that Maybelline is doing very well and we want to build on that," Mr. Peyrelongue said. Maybelline will have access to L'Oreal's research laboratories and L'Oreal plans to expand Maybelline's sales overseas, especially in Latin American and the Far East.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
In courting black consumers, some marketers don't have to check their calendars anymore.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
CONSUMERS could be excused for thinking the Madison Avenue calendar includes an annual winter festival of black advertising that begins in mid-January with earnest advertisements from mainstream marketers "saluting the legacy" of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- timed for the holiday in his honor -- and continues through February with campaigns "celebrating Black History Month."
Then on March 1, the festival ends. And so, it seems, do many of the efforts to cultivate black consumers, who spend an estimated $250 billion to $300 billion each year in the American economy. That occurs despite the results of surveys like a recent study by Paul Sladkus International in New York, which found that more than 70 percent of blacks agreed they were more likely to buy a product if its ads showed people of their race. 
 "There's this period we call the freedom window," said Howard Buford, president of Prime Access, a New York agency that specializes in marketing to blacks, homosexuals and people who speak Spanish. Ken Smikle, president of Target Market News, a marketing newsletter in Chicago, describes it as the "black window."
Whatever it is called, it is difficult to ignore.
"You definitely get a bulge in January and February," said Caroline R. Jones, president and creative director at Caroline Jones Inc., a New York agency specializing in marketing to black consumers. "People come out of the woodwork who aren't there the rest of the year."
Mr. Buford suggested such rationed advertising might stem from "discomfort with the African-American market and not having people high in a company who know how to handle it." Those marketers, he added, would perceive ads honoring Dr. King or Garrett A. Morgan, who received a patent for the three-way automatic traffic signal in 1923, as a safe way to "try making meaningful connections" with black consumers.
Teri Williams, senior vice president for marketing at the Boston Bank of Commerce, which is introducing a Unity Visa credit card that donates 1 percent of card holder charges to organizations like the Jackie Robinson Foundation, said: "It's not that one ad isn't a good thing. But if a company is really trying to be effective, it should recognize that African-Americans understand who really supports the community."
And Mr. Smikle warned that marketing executives who limit their black-oriented campaigns to six weeks in winter "run the risk of being held accountable the rest of the year by people who say: 'You took out an ad saluting Dr. King's legacy. Part of that legacy is economic empowerment.' "
Indeed, there are signs that ads aimed at blacks from mainstream marketers are not just for wintertime anymore, according to executives at agencies and media that specialize in this market segment as well as advertising managers at mainstream consumer companies.
"We are now involved in at least six separate, and I would consider legitimate and serious, inquiries about our services" for year-round campaigns, Ms. Jones said.
Roger Greene, district manager for corporate advertising at the AT&T Corporation in New York, said: "We create a special ad for Black History Month or Dr. King's birthday. But we also have an ongoing program that runs in flights during the year, and the budget for that has grown a little more than fourfold since February 1990."
Indicative of AT&T's efforts, he added, is a print ad by the Uniworld Group in New York that asserts, "At AT&T, black history wasn't born yesterday." The ad features photographs of the actress Ruby Dee today and in 1942, when she worked for the Western Electric unit of AT[T] it appears in black-owned magazines and newspapers as well as in Time and USA Today.
The General Motors Corporation has agreed to be the exclusive automotive advertiser for 1996 in American Legacy, a quarterly magazine that describes itself as "a celebration of African-American history and culture." American Legacy is being introduced with a spring issue by RJR Communications and the American Heritage unit of Forbes Inc.
"We're talking to advertisers about reaching this marketplace" on a regular basis, said Rodney J. Reynolds, president at RJR Communications in Cleveland and publisher of American Legacy, "rather than trying to develop opportunities in terms of the time of the year."
The spring issue of American Legacy carries 24.5 ad pages from marketers that besides General Motors include AT&T, with the ad featuring Ms. Dee; the American Express Company; General Mills, for Honey Nut Cheerios cereal; the Philip Morris Companies, and the State Farm Insurance Companies. Only two focus on Black History Month.
"There's a significant long-term opportunity," said Tim Forbes, president of American Heritage and acting chief executive of Forbes Inc. in New York. "Clearly there's a recognition that there's a very significant population that has in many respects been overlooked."

Apartments Built to Rent Rise on River At Jersey City

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Pilings are being driven deep into a slice of Jersey City's waterfront for the foundation of Riverside Tower, the first new residential construction at the huge Newport complex in six years.
The $50 million building is being developed by the Lefrak Organization of Rego Park, Queens. It will have 346 apartments, from studios to three-bedroom layouts, in a 33-story building on land that juts into the Hudson and offers clear views of lower Manhattan. 
 The new building underscores renewed interest in rental housing for Jersey City's riverfront. There are two other new and revived developments, recently completed or under way, and their developers are planning additional rental buildings. All told, the projects will produce more than 1,500 apartments.
The activity is being stoked by demand for market-rate rentals. The vacancy rate for the more than 2,000 existing waterfront residences is about 1 percent; for Jersey City it is about 8 percent, according to the ACI Group, a real estate services concern that manages 1,000 rentals in the city.
The demand is coming from the thousands of workers employed by companies that have filled most of the city's 6.5 million square feet of prime waterfront office space. It is also coming from local renters looking to trade up, empty-nesters from the suburbs and people from Manhattan drawn by amenities like parking and lower rents, said Robert P. Antonicello, ACI's president. He said rents averaged $18 to $24 a square foot a year, compared with $20 to $30 a square foot for comparable rents in Manhattan.
A 1995 survey by the firm forecasts that the activity will continue. Of a projected 11,688 residences to be built by 2005 on the Hudson County portion of the Hudson's west shore, about one-third will rise in Jersey City, which still has a supply of former industrial land that was the old waterfront. Indeed, the Newport complex, where much of the housing now exists, can fit 7,000 additional residences.
More waterfront housing is good news for Jersey City. "It will put people on the street" after offices close and spur additional amenities like restuarants and "watering holes" to open, said Robert Cotter, its director of planning.
Mr. Antonicello said the demand for the near term would be for rentals and barring an economic downturn "the market will be able to absorb all those under way and planned."
Developers like Richard S. LeFrak, president of the Lefrak Organization, agree. He said his company had conceived and designed Riverside Tower as a condominium but switched to rentals because of the strength of the market. Financing, which is coming from a pension fund, also opened up, making it a propitious time to move ahead, Mr. LeFrak added.
Monthly rents for the apartments, from 520 to 1,500 square feet, will be $825 to $2,600. Leasing at Riverside, with features like high-ceilinged apartments and a concierge, is to begin late this spring, Mr. LeFrak said.
Mr. LeFrak said a second 454-apartment building was planned and whether it would be a rental or condominum would be determined by the market. Construction on that building would begin after the first is completed in about a year.
Work also continues at Avalon Cove, with 504 rentals in two five-story buildings on 11 acres just south of Newport. The developer, Avalon Properties Inc., based in New Canaan, Conn., with offices in Princeton, N.J., is to begin marketing the project next month with occupancy on some apartments to start in April. Monthly rents for the one- to three-bedroom apartments, plus fifth-floor duplexes are $1,100 to $3,100.
Jeffrey B. Albert, an Avalon vice president, said his company had acquired three adjacent acres to build some 220 more rentals because "the demand has not yet been satisfied." He said construction on those rentals would start when the first 504 were leased, which is expected by the start of 1997.
At another project, the owners revived a 229-apartment condominium as a rental last year and leased the apartments -- studios to three bedrooms and penthouses -- at $900 to $3,000 in four months. Now the owners are moving up the construction date of a second 299-apartment rental building to June from December, said Michael Barry, vice president at the Applied Companies in Hoboken. Applied, together with partners, bought the project on Washington Street in 1994.
The new rentals will be slightly smaller than the earlier ones, with 600 to 2,200 square feet of space, and the number of studios will be decreased in favor of more three-bedroom apartments, Mr. Barry said.

HEADLINE: MARATHON;
Parenthood On the Run

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo.

 BODY:
Gwyn and Mark Coogan are the first married contenders in the United States Olympic marathon trials, though daily life can feel more like a frantic relay race in which their 26-month-old daughter, Katrina, plays the part of the baton.
"One person's in the door, the next one's out the door," Mark said. "We hand her off." 
 Gwyn, 30, will be a favorite tomorrow in the women's trials in Columbia, S.C. Mark, 29, will be a contender Feb. 17 at the men's trials in Charlotte, N.C. If the Coogans finish among the top three, they would be the first married American runners to compete in the same Olympics since Francie Larrieu (1,500 meters) and Mark Lutz (200 meters) at the 1976 Montreal Games.
"We both have a legitimate shot," Mark Coogan said. "We might come in fourth, but we could also win."
Their success as elite distance runners has required an intricate, if sometimes harried, balancing of their roles as partners, parents, athletes and in Gwyn's case, as a scholar. She is a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics at the University of Colorado, a dissertation away from her doctorate in number theory. Until this semester, she also taught calculus at the university, while putting 90 miles a week on her distance-running odometer.
Mark, who holds an economics degree, has inquired about law school at Colorado, but the requirement that he be a full-time student is at the moment incompatible with a training schedule of 130 miles a week. He does the laundry, the grocery shopping and half of the cleaning, while Gwyn does most of the cooking and studies before dawn and after dark.
Last semester, she set the alarm for 5 A.M., studied until Katrina awakened for breakfast at 6:30, headed out the door at 7 for a 10-mile run, then returned home to shower and bike two miles to school for a 9 A.M. class. With Katrina in the care of a baby-sitter, Mark then did a morning run of 10 to 12 miles. When Gwyn returned from school, they alternated workouts again in the afternoon.
After Katrina was put to bed, Gwyn studied from 7:30 until 10. Like some intellectual Wallenda, she adroitly balanced her high-wire life of running, academics and motherhood. A former national road-racing champion and a 1992 Olympian at 10,000 meters, Gwyn ran her first race of 26.2 miles last October, winning the Twin Cities Marathon in the encouraging time of 2 hours 32 minutes 58 seconds.
Two other married couples will compete in the trials -- Michelle Petrus-Simonaitus and Dennis Simonaitus of Salt Lake City and Rebecca and Tom Redding of Tampa, Fla. -- but none of these runners is expected to qualify for the Olympics or the top prize money, which begins at $100,000 for the men's winner and $45,000 for the women's winner.
It would satisfy her just as much, Gwyn Coogan said, to have her friends read about her in the science section of the newspaper instead of the sports section. She wrestles with questions that have elusive answers: What can she realistically expect from a triangular life of motherhood, theoretical mathematics and world-class running? Has parenthood made her more, or less, productive as a worker? Can she reach her potential in all three endeavors?
"I want to be a fulfilled person," Gwyn said. "I have to ask myself, what is the best way? Is it by pursuing all these activities or pursuing one activity and doing it to the fullest?"
Three years ago, Gwyn won the national 15-kilometer road racing championship, unaware that she was pregnant, Mark said. Several weeks later, he said, she felt poorly at the world cross-country championships and went to see a doctor, thinking she was getting an ulcer. "The doctor said, 'You're not getting an ulcer, you're getting a baby,' " Mark said.
She continued to train, he said, and a day before giving birth, Gwyn biked to school and swam a mile. Two months ago, when she suffered a stress fracture that kept her from running for 16 days, she diligently ran in a pool, wearing a flotation device.
"She likes to have a lot of things going on," Mark said of Gwyn. "She's good at concentrating. I think school is good for her. It takes her mind off running and other things."
This semester, with the Olympic trials on the calendar, inevitable concessions have been made. Gwyn has pared teaching from her schedule. Katrina has been placed in day care three mornings a week. On weekends, when the Coogans alternately take runs of more than 20 miles, one drives the car while the other one trains, placing water bottles on the route, picking up discarded layers of clothing, offering encouragement while Katrina rides along in the child seat.
"I like to compete," Gwyn said. "You learn something about yourself. But there are other things I like to do. I want to do it and see my child. I love to walk in the park, to see her swing to her heart's desire. I run, I bike to school, bike home again, run again, and I've been outside, but I haven't been able to share it with my daughter. I can understand why people get up at five in the morning, so they can see their children wake up."
A native of Morrisville, Pa., Gwyn did not run while at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, and took up the sport only as a diversion at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., where she would win three Division III collegiate titles at 3,000 meters. Mark, on the other hand, was an all-round athlete from Attleboro, Mass., who would become an all-America steeplechaser at the University of Maryland. Even in high school, he talked of competing in the Olympics.
"When Gwyn was in high school, I'm not even sure she knew what the Olympics were," Mark joked.
Married five years, they met in 1988 in Boston, where Gwyn worked for a high-tech computer firm. Gwyn competed in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, though she said she felt overwhelmed by the experience, especially when she was caught in a crush of autograph seekers who pushed toward Magic Johnson and other members of the Dream Team during opening ceremonies. Unnerved by the scope of the Olympics, she did not qualify for the 10,000-meter final.
"I felt like I was at a mall at Christmastime, trying to find a last-minute gift for my sister," Gwyn said. "I wasn't prepared; I was scrambling around trying to get things together."
Having suffered a deflating hamstring injury, Mark finished 10th at the 1992 Olympic trials in the steeplechase. Since then, he has become one of the country's most resourceful distance runners, with 3:58 capability in the mile, 13:23 speed at 5,000 meters and an impressive 2:13:24 debut at the 1994 Boston Marathon, followed by a second-place finish at the 1995 Pan American Games in 2:15:21.
"I was really sad in 1992," Mark said. "We have the baby now. If I don't make it this time, Katrina will still be happy to see me. But I still want to crush those guys if I can."
First things first. While Gwyn runs this weekend, Mark will stay home and baby-sit.

HEADLINE: Another Chinese Provocation

 BODY:
Every week seems to bring a new Chinese challenge to President Clinton's stewardship of American foreign policy. There have been Chinese military threats against Taiwan, Chinese repression of dissidents and Chinese indifference to trade agreements with the United States. Now comes word from the Central Intelligence Agency that Beijing has secretly sold sensitive nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan.
The Clinton Administration, in its eagerness to prevent relations with China from taking another tumble, has watched this pattern with dismay but done little so far to make China pay a price. Passivity in the face of belligerence is a dangerous course. Washington must not let the latest Chinese provocation go unanswered. 
 Under United States anti-proliferation law, the sale of 500 magnets to Pakistan that can be used to refine bomb-grade uranium would normally trigger an economic penalty -- a cutoff of nearly $10 billion in loan guarantees for American corporations doing business in China. The Clinton Administration is now debating whether it should waive this penalty, to avoid hurting American businesses and damaging relations with Beijing. A waiver would be a mistake.
Punishment of China may chill discussions between the two countries at a moment when the United States needs to use its influence to reduce the heat building between China and Taiwan. But waiving the legal penalty for such a flagrant sale of weapons technology to Pakistan, a country whose nuclear program Washington has been trying to freeze for years, would undercut America's anti-proliferation efforts around the world.
It would also reinforce China's suspicion that America's policies, warnings and even laws can be ignored with impunity because Washington will always back off to preserve diplomatic harmony and protect business profits. Washington should not encourage that view while China is gauging how hard it can push against Taiwan without provoking an American response.
This is not the first time the United States has tried to improve relations by deliberately overlooking Chinese misconduct, in areas from human rights to weapons proliferation. That course has usually proven ineffective, even counterproductive. The Clinton Administration has recently threatened retaliation for China's continued piracy of American intellectual property like compact disks and computer software. It would be odd to confront China over copyrights while ignoring the sale of dangerous nuclear weapons technology.
American economic penalties against Beijing have often been threatened but rarely applied, so it is hard to know how much they would influence the Chinese and how easily China could replace American business deals. Ideally, all major trading nations should apply coordinated economic penalties against countries that spread nuclear weapons technology and materials.
If American economic penalties do not deflect Beijing from its present policies, Washington may have to consider tougher economic and diplomatic sanctions, and persuade its major allies to support them. The first step is to cut off the loan guarantees. To waive this legally prescribed penalty would only encourage Beijing to risk even more reckless international behavior.

Government Securities Prices Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of government securities rose yesterday following a bond auction that traders described as fairly successful.
The 30-year bond at auction had an average yield of 6.119 percent, down from 6.906 percent in August and the lowest yield since the Treasury began selling that maturity in 1977. By the close of the New York market, the currently traded 30-year issue was up 6/32 , to 10930/32 for a yield of 6.14 percent, down from 6.15 percent on Wednesday. 
 Analysts said that now that the quarterly auction was over, bond prices might be ready to move higher as the focus shifted back to the weak economy and low inflationary pressures, both of which are ingredients for further Fed interest rate cuts to spur the economy.
In the limited data released yesterday, nonfarm productivity was up 1.4 percent and initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb 3 were down by 21,000, to 368,000, from the revised figure of the previous week.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said he was impressed with the results of the auction. "It tells us where investors assign value along the various maturities," he said. "Today we saw a yield of 6 1/8 percent deemed very attactive."
Mr. Alexy seemed impressed with the refunding and said that "for this stage of the process much of the securities are in the hands of the end users." The drop in yield, Mr. Alexy said, suggests that people probably did not get at all the bonds they wanted.
"I find this auction similar to the August auction," Mr., Alexy said. "It is at the top of its trading range, and, more significantly, the market was also worrying about supply, only the economy is now in worse shape. We won't be surprised to see today's 30- year bond a month from now trading at a price of 5.75 percent and at about 5.50 percent by the summer."
There is nothing in the wind to change the economic fundamentals, he says, with next week's Philadlephia Fed survey of business activity the only key data outstanding.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, added some backdrop to market activity when business wires reported that he said the housing market has been stable for the last three years, and that the Fed could best aid the economy by providing a "stable platform" for growth, with a budget deal essential.
Elsewhere in the corporate bond market, the Export-Import Bank of Korea led borrowers yesterday selling $500 billion of 10-year global bonds through underwriters led by the joint managers, Lehamn Brothers and Salomon Brothers.
According to the underwriters, demand was solid as investors placed three times as many orders as there were securities available, which allowed the securities to narrow the yield spread between the Korean securities and United States Treasuries with a similar maturity.
The bonds were priced to yield 6.451 percent, or about 77 basis points more than United States securities.

Sony Profit Up in Quarter; Forecast for Year Lowered

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The Sony Corporation said today that group pretax profit rose 25 percent in its fiscal third quarter, aided by the popularity of the company's video-game machine and movies, but it lowered its earnings forecast for the full fiscal year because of slowing demand for computer equipment and recorded music in the United States.
The giant Japanese company had increased its forecast for the fiscal year, which ends March 31, in November because of expectations that sales of computer equipment in the United States would continue to grow sharply. But Christmas sales were weak. 
 "The U.S. computer business has been slowing down since late last year, but we see this as a temporary correction," Sony's managing director, Sumio Sano, said at a news conference today. He said Sony continued to believe that sales of such products as computer monitors and CD-ROM drives would climb over the long term.
The weaker consumer spending in the United States is also hurting Sony's sales of recorded music, a company spokesman said.
In the fiscal third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, Sony's group pretax earnings rose to 73.96 billion yen, or $693 million at current exchange rates, up 25 percent from 59.16 billion yen in the corresponding 1994 period. Net income increased 47 percent, to 37.14 billion yen from 25.26 billion yen.
Sales rose 17.5 percent, to 1.343 trillion yen from 1.143 trillion yen. Mr. Sano said sales were increased nearly 3 percent by the yen's decline against other major currencies. As the yen falls, sales denominated in foreign currencies convert into greater amounts of the Japanese currency. Sony sells more than two-thirds of its products outside Japan.
For the full fiscal year, Sony now expects pretax profit of 145 billion yen. That is below Sony's November forecast of 155 billion yen but still in contrast to the pretax loss of 220.95 billion yen in the prior fiscal year, when Sony took a write-down of 265 billion yen to account for losses from its Hollywood business.
The company said it expected net income in the fiscal year to be 54 billion yen, down from the earlier forecast of 65 billion yen but in contrast to the loss of 293.36 billion yen a year earlier. It expects sales of 4.5 trillion yen, up from the earlier forecast of 4.4 trillion yen and the figure a year earlier of 3.98 trillion yen.
Sony announced its third-quarter results and its new forecasts after the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Its shares closed in Tokyo today at 6,650 yen, or $62.27, up 130 yen.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Sony's American depository receipts fell $1, to $61.625. Each depository receipt equals one ordinary share in the Japanese company.
Sony said its third-quarter profit amounted to 88 cents a depository receipt. It based that calculation on a rate of 103 yen to the dollar; the dollar was trading today at more than 106.5 yen.
In reporting its results for the latest quarter, Sony said sales by its movie group, which includes Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star Pictures, rose 17 percent. It also cited strong sales of its Playstation game machine in the United States and Europe and particularly in Japan.
Despite the gloomy outlook for sales in the United States, Sony said it expected sales of computer-related products to remain strong in Japan, where sales of personal computers have been booming.

These Clothes Make the Man And the City

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
IF you're of the opinion that all is glitter and stardust in sending chiseled male models down a runway dressed in, oh, let's say a double-breasted lame jacket worn over charcoal wool stretch pants, you've got another think coming.
This is serious work, putting on a fashion show. 
 "For buyers, it's a necessity," the designer Donna Karan said yesterday in an old warehouse on West 16th Street, where she had just shown her fall men's line to store representatives and the fashion press. Just choosing the right display space is crucial, Ms. Karan observed. "They need to be up close to see the fabric, because in men's wear it's all about fabric and cut," she said. "We're constantly trying to figure out how to get people in touch with the clothes."
There you have it. And if you're not sure what that all means, don't waste time worrying about it.
What you need to focus on is that everyone there -- designers, buyers, models, tailors, writers, photographers -- is a cog in a multimillion-dollar machine called Men's Fashion Week in New York. It is a semiannual event, first organized last winter to put big-name clothes makers on display in a bunch, the hope being that it would add oomph to an apparel industry whose worth to the city's economy is estimated by experts at $27 billion a year.
That's billion with a "B," as in Big Bucks. It bears remembering that the Donna Karans and Calvin Kleins are far more than filler for people columns. They are star attractions of an enterprise that, according to the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, brings 23,000 buyers a year to the city (and to its hotels and restaurants) and accounts for 225,000 local jobs, from gorgeous models to less glamorous fellows who make the coat racks.
"IT is a huge industry," Barbara Randall, a spokeswoman for the improvement district, said with understatement. Its importance was underlined last week when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed getting rid of the city sales tax on clothing purchases under $500. The city may lose revenue, the Mayor acknowledged. But he asserted that the change would keep many shoppers from running off to New Jersey, and ultimately would increase retail sales.
"Love that idea," said Fern Mallis, executive director of Seventh on Sixth, the company that organized the fashion week and its 19 shows. "How can anybody object?"
For its megadollars, the industry must traffic in image and fantasy, and the shows become "essential to build excitement for the marketplace," said Lavelle Olexa, a senior vice president of Lord & Taylor. To a novice, these displays can be a hoot, from the moment you enter the Sony Music Studios on West 54th Street, to name one location this week, and have a bottle of designer water thrust into your hand.
The audience is filled with industry types who travel from runway to runway and know one another well. There are endless hugs and kisses blown across cheeks (both the left and the right, European-style). The background music is often bone-jarring, and a sprinkling of celebrities enhances the finger-snap pace. At the Tommy Hilfiger show the other morning, Tommy Tune spotted Gregory Hines. "I thought I would see you today," Mr. Tune exclaimed, sounding as though he couldn't have been more delighted.
As for the clothes, they provide entertainment, too. Some of Mr. Hilfiger's unsmiling models looked as if they had just left a sherbet factory that exploded, such as the fellow in a pink shirt with french cuffs, orange checked tie and yellow corduroy jeans.
SERIOUSLY now, is there a big market for that sort of get-up?
"These outfits show our creative side, letting people see how far we can stretch it," Mr. Hilfiger said to an interviewer who has been told that his clothes could put coffee to sleep (they're that dull). "If I showed what you're wearing on the runway, people would yawn and walk out."
No offense seemed to be meant, and none was taken.
For buyers, even those who have seen it all hundreds of times, the shows remain an indispensable trend-spotting tool. "If 20 designers are using velvet or Ultrasuede, buyers have a chance to see what the clothes look like on real people and not hangers," said Kalman Ruttenstein, the men's and women's fashion director at Bloomingdale's.
But the fashion parades go by so fast! Weeks and months of preparation go into shows that typically last 15 minutes. Brevity, however, is not always a shortcoming, the pros advise.
"In men's wear, it can get boring, and you don't want to bore the audience," Mr. Ruttenstein said. "How many suits can you sit and look at?"

HEADLINE: Retail Chain Sales Show Modest Gain

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Sales at the nation's biggest retail chains rose tepidly in January, according to figures released yesterday, but analysts said the horrible winter in the Northeast and Midwest held down the numbers.
The Goldman, Sachs retail composite index, which reflects sales data from about 60 companies, rose by 1.1 percent in January, following a 2 percent increase in December. In January 1995, when the weather was better and consumer balance sheets were a bit healthier, the index was up 4.7 percent. 
 "The figures were not all that great," said Richard Baum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "But they are not all that much different from what we have been seeing for the last several months."
Still, Mr. Baum said that without the inclement weather the index would "probably" have been about three to four percentage points higher.
"January did mark some turnaround from the very depressed Christmas sales numbers," said Jeffrey Feiner, a retailing analyst at Salomon Brothers. "But the conditions that have adversely effected retailing are still with us."
For virtually all retailers, January is the last and slowest month of the fiscal year. Since post-Christmas discounting is almost always prevalent -- and was particularly pronounced last month -- January usually represents only 4 percent of annual sales, and 10 to 20 percent of fourth-quarter earnings, Mr. Baum said.
"January is always a very bad month, because of clearance sales," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a Scotch Plains, N.J., forecasting firm. "But the price reductions this year went far beyond what we have seen in the past."
Investor reaction to the sales reports was mixed. Federated Department Stores, which registered strong growth in sales, nevertheless saw its share price dip 25 cents, to $27.125. But the Gap Inc. rose by $2 a share, to $51, and Talbots gained $1.625, to $30.75.
The discounting was fierce among specialty apparel and off-price chains.
Over all, this group saw sales rise by one-tenth of 1 percent, according to the Goldman, Sachs index. But that meager increase masks what was almost certainly a drop in profitability.
At Talbots, for instance, comparable store sales rose 13.1 percent in January. But Mr. Barnard said the impressive gain was almost entirely due to deep price cuts that would do little to help the bottom line.
Still, analysts said there were some pockets of strength.
Among department stores, Federated, where comparable store sales rose by 5.1 percent, and Kohl's, which registered a 5 percent increase, were seen as positives.
Apparel sales at the Gap, which posted a 6 percent increase in comparable store sales, were better than expected.
And among discounters, analysts said that KMart, which saw comparable store sales for the entire company rise by 5.5 percent, and Target, where sales rose by 8.4 percent, were fairly strong.
But sales at Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer, rose by only 1.3 percent. And sales at specialty hard goods retailers like Circuit City, Best Buy and Lowe's were almost universally disappointing.
According to the Goldman, Sachs composite index, department store sales fell by 1.1 percent during January, discount stores rose by 4.5 percent and specialty hard goods retailers fell 4.7 percent.
In short, for many retailers January was the bleak end to a brutal year. And expectations for 1996 are not high.
"There is no question that consolidation in the industry is going to continue, certainly in the specialty apparel and off-price sectors," Mr. Baum at Goldman, Sachs said. "These are two sectors that continued to add square footage in the first half of the 1990's in the face of sales that were not growing that rapidly."
And then there is the demand side of the equation.
Although there are a few positive signs in consumer spending -- a recent surge in mortgage refinancings and some modest growth in real wages, to name two -- Mr. Baum and other analysts are not sanguine about the prospects of a sudden boom.
Consumer spending is rising at an annual rate of 2 percent to 4 percent, ignoring the effects of inflation, Mr. Baum said. That is well below the normal increase of 4 percent to 6 percent.
And Mr. Barnard said: "With total consumer installment debt approaching $1 trillion and millions in the shadow of corporate downsizing, Americans today are reluctant to spend.
"The weather will get better, but consumer demand won't."

HEADLINE: Whatever Happened to Venezuela's Middle Class?

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
The snapshot that emerged from Luis Sandoval's pocket showed the 34-year-old former administrator for a manufacturer of heavy machinery standing in a driveway by his sparkling white Chevrolet Impala, his wife and daughter by his side.
Now, years later, when Government exchange controls have crippled business and squeezed him out of his job, the family car has become another of Caracas's rattle-trap taxis, and Mr. Sandoval's livelihood. The car's right headlight is gone, and the alignment is so bad the car seems to ski down the streets, trailing a spume of black smoke. 
 There are two children now, who get by on the same amount of milk one used to drink, diluted to go twice as far. Last Christmas, Mr. Sandoval, a graduate of Venezuela's most prestigious university, could only afford to buy a single toy for the two of them. There is three months' rent due at the end of the week, and this one-time paragon of the prosperous middle class has become desperate.
"We're living hand to mouth," Mr. Sandoval said.
At a time when the rest of South America is paring down public spending and opening up markets in the quest for foreign investment, Venezuela stands as a peculiarly enduring throwback to an age of excessive government economic intervention, and a reminder of its perils.
This Caribbean country of 24 million people, blessed with the world's largest oil reserves outside the Persian Gulf, last year became the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States. But its economy is in a shambles and its public payroll so bloated that hospitals cannot afford to buy medicine or equipment, while the Government remains unable -- or unwilling -- to trim its work force.
The country is entering its fourth year of recession, and the inflation rate, at 54 percent last year, is the highest in South America. Venezuela's middle class, once accustomed to shopping sprees in Miami, has been reduced to near-poverty.
"The middle class is disappearing," said Andres Serbin, president of the Venezuelan Institute for Social and Political Studies, a private research institute. "Now you have a clear polarization between the people who have and the people who don't have."
Juan Carlos Navarro, coordinator of the Center for Public Policy at the Institute for Advanced Administrative Studies, agreed. "People feel that every day they're getting poorer, and they're right," he said.
At the start of the 1990's, Venezuela appeared to be well on its way toward the free-market economic reforms that other parts of Latin America have since embraced. But austerity measures that were endured elsewhere in the continent proved too difficult an adjustment for Venezuelans who, thanks to a $10-billion-a-year cushion of oil revenues, had grown accustomed to government largess.
The backlash against the free-market reforms instituted by Carlos Andres Perez, who was then President, included looting and two attempted military coups in 1992. Although the coups failed, they proved fatal to the economic policies and to the presidency of Mr. Perez, who was impeached in 1993 and charged with stealing $17 million in public funds. He remains under house arrest.
As the country awaited Mr. Perez's reaction to the second 1992 coup attempt in a televised message from Congress, Rafael Caldera, a former president, unexpectedly took the microphone to voice understanding for the frustrations of the military men who led the coup attempts.
Swept back into the presidency by a mass yearning for less corrupt, more generous past, Mr. Caldera pledged to restore the kind of state-financed populism that had marked his administration in the 1970's, but he did not address the country's ability to finance such grand promises in the economy of the 1990's
His measures have failed to check Venezuela's economic slide.
According to a recent report by Data Information Resources to the Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce, in the last 25 years the share of household income spent on food has shot up to 72 percent, from 28 percent. The middle class has shrunk by a third. An estimated 53 percent of jobs are now classified as "informal" -- in the underground economy -- as compared with 33 percent in the late 1970's.
Economists complain that the country has functioned under Mr. Caldera without a coherent and consistent economic program, relying instead on emergency measures. The latest is a plan to compensate working people for rising prices with a system of modified indexation, which will raise wages every few months to help keep up with inflation. In Brazil, this approach led from double- to triple-digit inflation before it was abandoned in 1994.
The country is struggling back from a banking crisis that was five times the size of the savings and loan collapse in the United States, in terms of the percentage of gross national product. No sooner had Venezuela won plaudits for coming through the banking debacle, however, than it had to confront a scandal involving the system of severance payments for public employees, in which billions of dollars contributed to the system have disappeared.
That is one reason the Government has not concentrated on trimming the public sector, although Labor Minister Juan N. Carrido, and most analysts of Venezuela, agree the need is strong.
"The question of where you're going to get the money for severance payments is relevant only if you do the layoffs," said Fernando Egana, the Government spokesman. "Reduction of the public sector," he added pointedly, "is very much related to the growth of the private sector."
Although Mr. Caldera came into office denouncing the austerity measures that were imposed by Mr. Perez (partly to conform with directives from the International Monetary Fund), his own administration has been negotiating for a $3 billion loan from the I.M.F. since last year. Economists here say Venezuela does not need the money as much as it needs the credibility that such a loan would convey. The country has also been negotiating a second loan of undisclosed size to ease the social impact of any hardships imposed by an I.M.F. agreement.
Politically, President Caldera's reputation for personal honesty has brought the Government some measure of credibility, and pulling back from the austerity measures of his predecessor has helped build stability. A slew of state and local elected offices, created over the last half-dozen years, have also provided the country with a fresh crop of potential national leaders, like the highly popular Irene Saez, a former Miss Universe recently re-elected mayor of Chacao, a neighborhood in Caracas.
Another promising sign was the opening last month of the oil sector to private investment -- by the same President who nationalized it 20 years earlier. Industry executives flocked to Caracas to bid on exploration rights in 10 regions, using a formula that guarantees Venezuela at least 85 percent of the profits. But Juan Szabo, who put together the opening, said it would probably be three to four years before the country sees any revenues from privatization.
"I don't think Venezuela's problem is really one of income," said Mr. Szabo. "It's getting the housekeeping done and getting the economic process in line."
Paradoxically, some here feel the oil revenues will only delay the day of reckoning for President Caldera, putting off further the tough decisions he has been avoiding. The trouble, they say, is that while oil revenues give the President a reprieve, the money is never used "to accumulate capital and develop social programs that are not politically motivated," said Mr. Serbin, of the Institute for Social and Political Studies.
As Monsignor Baltazar Porros, vice president of Venezuela's Episcopal Confederation, prepares for the arrival of Pope John Paul II, he says the crisis Venezuelans are encountering is as much emotional and spiritual as economic.
The 1950's to 1980's, he said, were marked by "a kind of looting of the oil wealth, so young people have never lived in hard times." The loss of prosperity is more shattering than never having known it at all, he said. "Now, we see that our lives are the same as in any other country in Latin America."

HEADLINE: In Missouri, Good Times or Bad?;
Working but Not Spending in a Microcosm of the Nation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
Churning out goods from pickup trucks to refrigerator magnets, factories across this Midwestern heartland are hiring so many workers that labor shortages are developing in some areas.
But the consumers who are supposed to be buying these products are holding back, anxious about their jobs and fearful of piling up more debt. 
 These midwinter crosscurrents, swirling around the national economy as well as Missouri's, are proving both a puzzle and a worry. Economic statistics show the same clashing trends as those that emerged from a five-day trip across the state, which included interviews with shoppers, salespeople, executives, bankers and plant managers. Missouri is judged by Regional Financial Associates, a consulting group, to be the closest state to being a microcosm of the overall American economy.
The contradictions raise some intriguing questions:
With jobs here plentiful, why are consumers in such a funk?
Is their mood of retrenchment now so embedded that it could pull the economy into recession, or will the solid level of business spending and profits eventually lift Americans' spirits and open their pocketbooks?
And, finally, will President Clinton find himself hobbled in his re-election bid by an aging economic recovery, just as President George Bush was hurt four years ago by an economy whose recovery was not yet apparent?
Chats with shoppers suggest that the root of the malaise is job insecurity. After all the corporate downsizings of recent years, some people are earning less than they used to and a lot of others are fearful of losing the jobs they have. As a result, millions of Americans are putting off major expenses.
On a recent trip to the Metro North Shopping Center here, for example, Ron and Vernita Riley said they were planning to limit their spending to the basics, like shoes for their 1-year-old daughter Annie, and skip big-ticket purchases like televisions and new winter coats. The larger home the young couple had hoped to buy this year will have to wait, they said.
"We're cutting back a lot," Mrs. Riley said, because her truck-driver husband recently took a lower-paying job after being laid off. "We don't feel secure."
Not that Mr. Riley, 30, would have much time to enjoy new acquisitions even if he could afford them; he now works five 16-hour days a week instead of four 10-hour days. Despite the grueling schedule, he makes about 10 percent less than before because he is paid by the mile instead of the hour. 'It's pretty easy to find a job," he said, but much harder to find one that's "steady."
For Ron Varley, steady jobs may be a thing of the past. On a recent evening, he took a stroll with his wife, Nancy, through the Greater St. Louis International Auto Show.
"I've been through a bank closedown, a bank merger and a bank reorganization in the past five years," said Mr. Varley, 58, who was laid off each time. He now works as a manager in the personnel department at United Van Lines, earning 10 percent less then he did at his previous job. The Varleys, who canceled a new-car order in 1995, are only looking this year.
Another sign of consumer cautiousness is the growing popularity of used cars. Thomas K. Sight, president of Bob Sight Ford in Lee's Summit, a Kansas City suburb, said last year's upbeat buying pattern had been reversed. Reflecting high prices, he said his dealership sold about 95 used vehicles and 75 new ones last month, compared with 75 used and 85 new in January 1995. "We had a very tough month," Mr. Sight said.
In fact, the overall growth in retail sales is slowing. While retail sales in Missouri rose 9 percent in 1994, they increased 7 percent last year and are expected to slow further to 5.4 percent this year, according to Regional Financial Associates. And consumers appear to have put the brakes on in recent months, according to figures from Telecheck Services Inc., which show purchases by check down on a year-over-year basis in October through January after rising modestly in earlier months.
If consumers are already a drag on the economy, Vicki Jacobson fears they might soon get even stingier. Ms. Jacobson, the director of education at the St. Louis-based Consumer Credit Counseling Service, says the number of people seeking help with credit problems has surged by 25 percent last month compared with a year earlier. The number of people participating in its debt-management programs was up 21 percent, she added.
A lot of homeowners went on buying binges after refinancing their mortgages in 1993 and 1994, Ms. Jacobson said, spending more than they could afford. Now, she said, those excesses are forcing them to put on the brakes. "Some people are not fully aware of the kind of situation they may be getting themselves into," she said.
The economic paradox of all this is that in the midst of consumer constraint, many businesses are bursting at the seams and cannot seem to produce their goods and services fast enough.
"I'm looking to hire drivers in the wintertime," said an amazed David Potts, general manager of Bulk Haulers Inc., a St. Louis company that transports structural steel and pipe and is involved in installing a sewer system for the Anheuser-Busch brewery there. Ordinarily, the winter months are slack for Bulk Haulers and, if anything, Mr. Potts has to lay off drivers.
Statewide, the unemployment rate sank to 3.7 percent in the last quarter of 1995 from around 5 percent in the first three quarters. With the eighth-lowest jobless rate in the country, unemployment is the one key measure in which Missouri differs significantly from the national average. The rate is the lowest for Missouri since the late 1970's, according to William C. Niblack, head of research at the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.
This made Missouri one of the tightest labor markets in the country, where the jobless rate has been about 5.5 percent since late 1994. The worker shortage is particularly painful to employers in smaller cities and towns, such as Washington, a quaint town perched on a bank of the Missouri River. Washington is home to Magnet Inc., a maker of specialty advertising magnets that in its 11 years has become the world's No. 1 producer. When it sought to expand, however, it was forced to build a second plant in Illinois because it could not find workers locally.
"The problem my customers have is finding enough employees," said Dick Mayer, president of the 119-year old Bank of Washington. Mr. Mayer projects a decline of between 5 and 10 percent in motor-vehicle loans this year -- but expects business lending to surge by 10 percent, identical to last year's pace.
Missouri, which trails only Michigan as an assembler of motor vehicles, benefits from the popularity of the pickup trucks, vans and other products made by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in the St. Louis area and by Ford in Kansas City.
"The vehicles we produce happen to be in strong demand," said Russell Signorino, work force coordinator for the St. Louis County Economic Council. Mr. Signorino noted that the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the St. Louis-based aircraft company, went through a major downsizing in the early 1990's, shedding some 17,000 jobs, but has now stabilized.
The other evening, in fact, the company took over the entire lobby of the Hyatt Regency St. Louis, which occupies the painstakingly restored former Union Station, to celebrate delivery of the first F/A-18 Hornet fighter-bombers to the Swiss Air Force.
If consumers in a state with such a buoyant economy as Missouri's continue to scrimp, some economists wonder what this implies for the national economy. If their behavior is duplicated throughout the country, they ask, could it nudge an economy that is already showing signs of weakness into recession?
Laurence H. Meyer, a St. Louis economic consultant who does work for the Clinton Administration, does not think so.
While he describes consumer retrenchment as "the leading edge" of the current slowdown in the economy's growth rate, he doubts it will become severe enough to set off a recession. That is mainly because the economy is being propped up by both robust business spending and a surge in American exports, which were up 12.2 percent in the first 11 months of 1995 from a year earlier.
Other economists warn that the danger of recession is real. James E. Annable, chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, points to two signs of economic fragility: Disposable personal income was up just 1.9 percent between January and November of last year, and household installment debt as a share of disposable income hit a new peak of 18.8 percent in November, surpassing a previous high in 1989.
Consumers "are two-thirds of total spending, and it's a tricky stabilization problem" for policy makers, essentially the Federal Reserve, to try to throttle the economy down to a sustainable pace when vulnerable consumers leave no margin for error, Mr. Annable said.
"This is a cycle that is behaving differently than expansion cycles usually behave," he added. "You could get an accidental recession."
That, of course, would be very bad news for Mr. Clinton. While inflation and unemployment remain low, Mr. Clinton appears vulnerable to charges that income growth has been sluggish and the economy is slowing down. These two factorsmay become the ammunition that Republicans have been seeking.

HEADLINE: Late Advance Drives Dow Above 5,500

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Stocks continued to rise yesterday, pushing stock indexes to record highs for the fourth consecutive session, even as the market confounded professional investors who have been baffled by its recent gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average moved above the 5,500-point level for the first time, finishing ahead 47.33 at 5,539.45. Records were also set by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which closed at 656.07, up 6.14, and by the Nasdaq composite index, which was up 8.29, to 1,093.17. 
 Following a recent trading pattern, prices yesterday weakened in the morning, stabilized in the early afternoon and then surged -- especially in the larger, blue-chip stocks -- just before the close.
"What is interesting is that the focus changes every day," said E. Wayne Nordberg, equity partner at Lord, Abbett & Company in New York. "It's extremely volatile on a day-to-day basis. There is no real leadership that has emerged in the advance this year."
Mr. Nordberg credited lower interest rates and a sluggish economy with creating a large pool of cash with little place to go but the financial markets. As consumers pay their debts and companies sell off inventories of goods, the money is flowing into stocks, a situation he does not see changing until the economy begins to pick up perhaps later this year.
"This is a classic liquidity-driven market," he said.
Advancing stocks outpaced decliners on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, 1,330 to 953. Issues reaching new highs totaled 230, while only 14 set new lows.
The New York Stock Exchange Index was up 2.83 points, to 349.15. The American Stock Exchange composite index closed at 564.66, up 2.07.
The market's strength so far this year -- the Dow is up 8.3 percent since Jan. 1 -- has wreaked havoc on the full-year forecasts of several of Wall Street's most well-known strategists. Many had predicted that share prices, which soared in 1995, would level off this year as corporate earnings growth declined.
"The amateurs are outdoing the professional so far this year," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers in New York.
With interest rates declining, shares of banking companies were strong. Wells Fargo rose 5, to 258 1/4, and Nationsbank, added 3, to 73 1/2.
Investors also favored consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola, which closed at a record 80 1/4, up 2 1/4. Gillette rose 1, to 56 1/4, while Kellogg gained 2 to close at 78 7/8.
Oil companies were also among the big winners yesterday. Exxon gained 1 7/8, to 82 5/8, while Chevron was up 11/64 , to 53.
Normally when energy companies gain, industrial stocks slide. But some of the biggest industrials were up yesterday, including Caterpillar, which gained 1 1/4, to 65 1/8, and Allied Signal, which was up 1 1/8, to 54 5/8.
Telephone companies, which were among the big gainers in Wednesday's trading, slipped back yesterday. Nynex was off 3 3/8, to 55 7/8, on reports that it was joining Bell Atlantic to offer long-distance service. Bell Atlantic lost 1/2 to close at 71 7/8.
Technology stocks, which also had a big rise earlier in the week, were down for the second consecutive day. Micron Technology, which was the day's most active issue, fell 1 1/2, to 39 7/8; Intel was down 3/8, to 57 7/8 in Nasdaq trading, while Motorola, which makes both semiconductors and cellular phones, fell 5/8, to 57.
Not all technology issues stumbled. I.B.M., which has seen a strong rise since its fourth-quarter results were announced in mid-January, rose again yesterday, closing at 113 1/2, up 7/8.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC EMPLOYEES VOTE 5-YEAR DEAL IN NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
New York City's largest municipal employees' union announced yesterday that its 120,000 members had approved a five-year contract with the city that promises job security and bolsters Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to maintain labor peace as he reduces the size of city government.
The Mayor and other city officials had voiced deep concerns about the prospects for approval after the teachers' union rejected a broadly similar contract in December. 
 Word of the contract's approval provoked open warfare within the union as some members charged vote fraud. The union had been deeply divided over the pact, with many members angry that it provides for no wage increases for the first two years even though the Mayor and City Council granted themselves raises in December.
But the contract includes a 13 percent pay increase in the accord's last three years, and will make it harder to close the gaping budget deficits projected for the city later this decade.
The union vote, 57 percent to 43 percent in favor of the contract, is a significant victory for Mr. Giuliani because it buys him five years of labor peace with the politically potent union, which represents about half the city's work force. It also gives him new leverage to pressure the suddenly isolated teachers' union to rethink its contract rejection.
While Mr. Giuliani trumpeted the contract as a money-saving, pattern-setting deal for the city, the union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, was bitterly divided yesterday, with some officials charging the union leadership with fraud in counting votes.
At the union's executive board meeting yesterday, the leader of a hospital workers' local angrily accused the union's executive director, Stanley Hill, of stealing the election and questioned why he would not release a breakdown of how each of the union's 56 locals had voted.
Just as angrily, Mr. Hill rejected accusations of fraud, asserting that the members approved the contract for a simple reason: it promises most of his members three years of job security at a time when governments and companies around the country are shedding workers.
Mr. Hill said his union, which includes accountants, clerical workers, engineers, librarians, social service workers, zookeepers and other nonuniformed city workers, voted 19,513 for ratification and 14,438 against.
"Our members will not only have job security, but economic benefits from this contract," Mr. Hill said in an interview. "The Mayor's not here for layoffs. He's here to work with us."
The ratification vote, the closest in District Council 37's history, had been in doubt until recent days because many members were angry at having to wait two years for raises while the Mayor, his top aides and City Council members received substantial salary increases.
Mr. Giuliani said the union's contract, including its two-year wage freeze, would set the pattern for the police and firefighters, who are at an impasse in their talks with the city after their contracts expired. Mr. Giuliani also said that District Council 37's accord could influence a possible arbitration decision on the teacher's union contract.
At a news conference, Mr. Giuliani said, "This goes a long way to setting the pattern for the city, because this covers virtually half the work force of the City of New York."
But the contract could prove a major fiscal headache for whoever is mayor in three years, when the raises begin. In its recently released financial plan, the Giuliani administration calculates that the District Council 37 contract, along with other labor contracts, will cost the city an additional $690 million in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1998, swelling to $2.2 billion in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2000. In fact, the city is still grappling with significant problems in the shorter term, with the city's budget director yesterday ordering city agencies to propose cuts totaling $500 million.
"It's a terrible contract for New Yorkers as a whole," Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said of the District Council 37 agreement. "Obviously, the city can't afford it because the city is projecting a $5.2 billion deficit in 2000, including $2.2 billion in increased labor costs."
But the Mayor and Mr. Hill emphatically disagreed.
"This contract helps the city save money," Mr. Hill said. "Remember, we've given the city a 24-month wage freeze. That's nothing to sneeze at."
Mr. Horton and many business leaders have faulted the contract for not including any concessions by the union on work rules.
Mr. Giuliani acted yesterday as if the District Council 37 vote strengthened his position against the 90,000-member United Federation of Teachers. Sandra Feldman, the union's president, has asked to go back to the bargaining table, but Mr. Giuliani has refused, saying he will not offer the teachers a better pact than the one they rejected.
Ms. Feldman, who had urged her members to ratify, said in an interview yesterday that District Council 37's vote would not pressure her into resubmitting the proposed teachers' contract to her members for a second vote.
"Ultimately, the Mayor has to go back to the bargaining table," she said of the teachers' dispute, although she acknowledged it might first go to a neutral fact-finder.
When District Council 37 members started voting on their contract in early December, it looked like an uphill battle. Many members were upset that Mr. Giuliani received a raise of $35,000, to $165,000. In addition, many members questioned how ironclad the contract's job security promises were, since Mr. Giuliani kept the right to order layoffs if the city plunged into a fiscal emergency.
Lastly, James Butler, president of the local representing aides at municipal hospitals, campaigned against it because Mr. Giuliani would not promise his members the same job security promised other workers, out of concern that Federal cuts would severely squeeze the city hospitals.
"This contract is very unhealthy for my members," Mr. Butler said. "It offers them no job security and it makes them wait 24 months for a raise."
It was Mr. Butler who said at yesterday's union board meeting, "They stole the election."
Accusations of fraud have swirled around District 37's downtown headquarters in recent days as the leaders of several locals questioned why such a large percentage of members in certain locals had cast mail ballots and why several locals waited weeks after mail ballots were turned in before announcing their results.
Mr. Hill said he could release a breakdown of how each local voted only after all the local presidents authorized him to do so.
One reason for all the mistrust is that District Council 37 gives its locals much leeway in how they vote. Some locals vote in members' meetings, some allow balloting at workplaces, some do mail ballots and have local officers count the votes and some have the American Arbitration Association count mail ballots to insure honesty.
Notwithstanding the divisions the contract created within the union, many labor experts said the ratification was a triumph for Mr. Hill, who has sought to position himself as the city's pre-eminent labor leader.
"This vote affirms Hill's power as a guy who can deliver his union," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center.
If District Council 37 had followed the teachers' lead and rejected the agreement, Mr. Giuliani's strategy of building close ties with the unions, to help him in the 1997 elections, would have been a shambles.
For months before the teachers and municipal workers voted, he had courted the leaders of those two unions; for their part, Mr. Hill and Ms. Feldman, despite their Democratic backgrounds, had worked closely with him. They said they were pleased that he was able to reduce the size of the city government by more than 15,000 workers through attrition rather than layoffs.
But relations between the Mayor and Ms. Feldman soured badly after her union rejected the contract. She angrily accused the Mayor of unwittingly undermining the contract by announcing his planned raise in the middle of the teachers' vote.
Despite Mr. Giuliani's original warm ties with the police, his relations with the police union have also grown strained. Many police officers have expressed unhappiness with the Mayor's plans to reduce the size of the police force by 1,500, while Mr. Giuliani and the police have clashed over a police-backed bill in Albany that would have a state board, rather than a city one, arbitrate police contract disputes. And the police, convinced that they deserve a raise because of their success in pushing down the crime rate, are also frustrated at the deadlock in their contract talks with the city.
"Every union is going to make an argument that they deserve more," said Norman Adler, a political consultant. "But once you have an agreement like the District Council 37 agreement, it will be very hard for any other union to move beyond it."

HEADLINE: Help Companies That Treat Workers Well, Kennedy Says

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Attacking corporate behavior in what he called the nation's "quiet depression," Senator Edward M. Kennedy said today that the Government should use tax breaks and penalties to encourage companies to look out for their workers.
The Senator, a Massachusetts Democrat, also proposed expanding antitrust laws to bar mergers that harmed communities and workers, broadening labor laws to protect temporary workers, and barring Government contracts to companies that repeatedly violated their workers' rights. 
 Mr. Kennedy's proposals were the first of several initiatives that Democrats plan to offer this spring although Congressional leaders acknowledge that their plans will not pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. Instead, as they argue that Democrats should be returned to power, they are seeking to move away from an essentially defensive stance of simply condemning Republican proposals to offering solutions of their own.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, his counterpart in the House, said the economy would be the focus of these efforts.
Mr. Kennedy said the steps he proposed were needed because even though many economic statistics looked good, "Americans are working more and earning less." He said, "Today's rising tide is lifting only some of the boats, primarily the yachts."
"Flat or falling wages," he said, "are compounded by the ever-present specter of layoffs. Once, corporations reduced their work forces only when they were in trouble. But now profitable companies are laying off good workers, at a time of increasing sales, in an endless quest for ever-fatter profits and ever-higher stock prices."
In a speech to the Center for National Policy, a Democratic issues forum, Mr. Kennedy called for using the tax laws to recognize corporate good citizens as "most favored companies," just as the Government gives tariff breaks to most-favored nations. These companies should pay lower corporate taxes, he said, and incentives should be created to encourage investment in them.
Businesses would earn "most favored company" status for their record in "creating jobs, avoiding layoffs simply to maximize profits, paying adequate wages, sharing gains, training and upgrading skills and providing decent health care and retirement benefits."
Mr. Daschle called Mr. Kennedy's speech "an example of the affirmative approach we need to be taking." He said Democrats needed to offer policies "to create and sustain good-paying jobs."
Mr. Gephardt, with whom Mr. Kennedy had also discussed his speech in advance, said House Democrats were preparing a legislative agenda, too. Not only would it focus on individual needs like health care, training and education, he said, but it would also try to find ways to encourage business to think of its workers as well as its shareholders.
He said the economic changes of today were as wrenching as those of a century ago. Just as Government then battled trusts and protected consumers, Mr. Gephardt said, today it must find ways to address "a stagnant economy," layoffs and "the erosion of the American dream."
Mr. Kennedy attacked Republicans as "bashing Medicare, slashing education and trashing the environment." But he argued that while some people in both parties argued that values, not economic issues, were the key to political success, the two could not be separated and that economic questions were paramount.
"We cannot solve great social problems by instructing people to be good while their financial situation is going from bad to worse," he said. "We have no chance of restoring values if we don't improve the lives of working Americans."
Mr. Kennedy said chief executives of typical corporations earn 190 times as much as their companies' average workers, and declared that it was time to "end the income gap, to put the American dream back in the dreams of all Americans."
Along with tax preferences for "responsible" corporations, Mr. Kennedy proposed eliminating provisions in tax law that he said "encourage layoffs, discourage job creation and reward companies for moving American jobs overseas."
He also called for an end to "tax deductions for expenses for mergers and acquisitions that result in substantial layoffs."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CAUCUSES;
Issues New, Iowa Returns to Spotlight

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Feb. 8

 BODY:
After an eight-year hiatus, Iowa has returned to center stage in the country's Presidential contest, and in the intervening years, prosperity and confidence have swept across the state like a prairie wind.
Having weathered the farm crisis of the 1980's and the recession of the early part this decade, Iowa's economy is booming. Businesses have flocked to the state in recent years, pushing unemployment down to 3.3 percent, far below the current national average, 5.8 percent. Per capita income rose by 40.8 percent from 1988 through 1994, a higher rate of growth than in the country as a whole. Exports are hitting record highs. And tax revenues have doubled since 1988, leaving the state with a $434 million surplus. 
 "You go all over the place and there are help-wanted signs everywhere," said Karla Underwood, Republican chairwoman for Linn County, which embraces Cedar Rapids in the north-central part of the state.
The state's turnaround goes beyond robust economic figures or the surge in home construction west of Des Moines and along the corridor from Iowa City to Cedar Rapids. In the last three years more people have moved to Iowa than have left, reversing two decades of population losses. And in an opinion survey conducted earlier this month by the Social Science Institute at the University of Iowa, only 11 percent of respondents said they felt that their condition would be worse in a year.
Iowa thus presents a markedly different picture than it did in 1988, the last time there was a hotly contested fight in the state's caucuses. Then, economic issues predominated, and the state's mood was sullen and angry. In 1992, Iowans were deprived of a national platform to express their views when President George Bush ran uncontested in the Republican race and Democratic hopefuls conceded to Senator Tom Harkin, a favorite son.
"The early to mid-80's were really tough times," said Thomas J. Miller, Iowa's Attorney General, remembering the economic and psychological climate that surrounded the 1988 caucuses. "We were just coming out of it, and we really didn't have a whole lot of confidence in light of what we had just gone through."
But if times are rosier now, many Iowans are concerned about issues like crime and remain mistrustful of politicians and the Federal Government, which played a pivotal role in bringing the state through its economic difficulties.
In the crisis of the 1980's, commodity prices dipped, farm values plummeted and bankruptcies soared. Iowa's farmers, whose output constituted about 45 percent of the overall economy, received an average of $1 billion annually in the form of Federal subsidies, said Mike Duffy, an economist at Iowa State University.
Still, when asked in the University of Iowa poll how much they trusted the Federal Government to do the right thing, only 20 percent of respondents said just about always or most of the time.
"They're all a bunch of ex-lawyers who are nothing but real good liars, whether they are Republicans or Democrats," said Paul Hynick, the 59-year-old manager of the sea food department at the Hy-Vee grocery store near Ottumwa. "I think people ought to be involved in politics on the local level. But nationally? Forget it. Money pays for all of it."
But if the good times have relegated the economy to the backburner, a number of other things are on people's minds.
Although crime rates are much lower than in metropolitan areas, the fear of crime remains pervasive. "Crime -- the gangs in their children's schools," said Linda Baker a customer service representative at a Cedar Rapids printing plant, when asked what she and her friends talk about. "We have a gentleman here at work whose son was killed in April by a random bullet in a school yard."
As a result of the loss of population in the 1980's -- mainly younger people who fled what they saw as a bleak future -- Iowa's population is significantly older than the country as a whole. According to the State Health Department, 15.4 percent of Iowans are more than 65 years old compared with 12.6 percent of the total United States population.
While the state has stanched the exodus of people, the newcomers have changed the mix of many Iowa cities. "There aren't any Iowans in my neighborhood," said Richard Schwab, dean of the School of Education at Drake University in Des Moines who moved here from New Hampshire six years ago. "My running buddy's from California. My neighbor next door is from Pennsylvania. The other one's from Minnesota."
Some Iowans remain concerned over the continued concentration of farming in fewer and fewer operations. Today, Iowa has about 100,000 farms, down from 145,000 in 1970.
And the growth of hog farming is causing environmental problems in several rural areas, especially in the north-central part of the state. In the last five years, more than 500 large-scale hog farms -- some with more than 20,000 mature pigs -- have begun operations in the state. Unlike waste products of chickens or cattle that are dried and sold as fertilizer, hog manure remains wet and is often stored in large open-air lagoons, some as long as football fields and as deep as 25 feet.
"Hogs have a smell to them, and always have had a smell," said Jim Braun, a farmer in Lattimer, about 80 miles north of Des Moines. "Usually it has just affected the farm, and once in a awhile, the neighbor might get a whiff. But what's happening now is that they're concentrating from 15,000 to 25,000 head of finishing hogs on one site."
With a population that is nearly 97 percent white, Iowa remains a state was less ethnic diversity than most others. In recent years, the state has seen an influx of Hispanic residents that has placed some strains, at times, on small rural communities.
Increasingly, these immigrants are taking jobs in small towns like Perry, West Liberty and Storm Lake, where nonunionized meat packing plants have found it difficult to recruit local people for the relatively low wages and tough working conditions involved.

NEW YORK CITY
 
Biggest City Union Votes Pact
 
 New York City's largest municipal employees' union has announced that its 120,000 members had approved a five-year contract with the city that promises job security and bolsters Mayor Giuliani's efforts to maintain labor peace as he reduces the size of city government. The Mayor and other city officials had been deeply worried about the prospects for approval after the teachers' union in December rejected their own contract, which had many similar provisions. [Page A1.]
 
Borough Hall for the Homeless
 Staten Island's Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, is allowing a handful of homeless men to spend nights in the 90-year-old French Renaissance-style Borough Hall. The men are sleeping among murals and mahogany, as well as the scent of old grandeur and maybe a bit of political opportunism. [B1.]
 
Man Questioned in Fatal Blaze
 Investigators were questioning a suspect last night in connection with the fire that killed a firefighter in a Brooklyn building identified by officials as a "chop shop" for stolen cars, a police spokesman said. Detectives said that the man being questioned was a 32-year-old Queens resident and that witnesses had seen him running from the makeshift garage. [B1.]
 
Clothes Make the Economy
 It is serious work, putting on a fashion show. Designers, buyers, models, tailors, writers and photographers are all cogs in a multimillion-dollar machine called Men's Fashion Week in New York. It is a semiannual event intended to add oomph to an apparel industry whose worth to the city's economy is estimated at $27 billion a year. NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
School Workers Settle a Strike
 School custodial helpers and a private company that provides custodial services at eight Brooklyn schools reached an agreement yesterday on a new labor contract, a day after the workers walked off the job, leaving 10,000 students and their teachers without heat for several hours. [B3.]
 
Lay Teachers Resist Clause
 Contract talks between the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and several hundred high school teachers have taken a contentious turn with the archdiocese's insistence that the teachers accept new language on the "religious mission" of the church or face dismissal. [B3.]
 
Pass Tissues: Collins Testifies
 A lawyer for Random House, which is suing the actress Joan Collins for breaking a two-book contract, confronted Miss Collins in court with some potentially damaging testimony she had given in another lawsuit. In 1992, the actress testified that a traumatizing event had prevented her from completing the novel she had been contractually obligated to write. [B3.]
 
Agencies Ordered to Plan Cuts
 New York City's budget director has sent a directive to city agencies ordering all of them to propose cuts to their budgets that together will total $500 million. The notice was a clear sign that the preliminary budget Mayor Giuliani proposed just last week includes many risky fiscal assumptions that could leave the city seriously short of money. [B2.]
 
Man Kills and Then Drops Dead
 A former New York City police officer was shot to death in his Brooklyn apartment by the father of a former colleague he had once been arrested for stalking, the police said. Then the father, after fleeing the former officer's basement apartment, suffered a heart attack on a street corner and died, the police said. [B4.]
 
REGION
 
Governors' Plans Aid Budget
 After a long year of budget debates in Washington, the Medicaid and welfare proposals endorsed by the nation's governors would represent by far the best fiscal deal yet for New York State's own fragile financial plan. Despite the governors' willingness to accept some continued Federal oversight, their proposals could still give state officials the tools to redefine the generous package of health care services that New York has traditionally provided to poor people. [A1.]
 
Dry Faucets Plague New Jersey
 The source of the concern in northeastern New Jersey was water, and the lack of it. For the second day in a row, thousands of residents in the region endured dry faucets brought about by the rupture of two water pipelines. [B1.]
 
 Two water main breaks that left New Jersey residents with little or no water may have stemmed from a chain of events that began a month ago, an engineer said. [B5.]
 
Democrats Claim Kickbacks
 The District Attorney's office in Nassau County is looking into allegations by three Democratic party members that they were pressured to donate to the party under the threat of losing their patronage jobs. The case echoes one from 11 years ago in which a group of Nassau County employees won a class action suit in Federal Court forcing the county's Republican Party to return $1.3 million in illegal kickbacks to county workers. [B4.]
 
2 Are Named to SUNY Board
 Governor Pataki is appointing a new chairman and vice chairman of the State University of New York Board of Trustees, further consolidating his control over the governing board for the 64-campus system. The Pataki appointees have been vocal advocates of a state university system that would be run according to "market forces." They want the campuses to have greater autonomy and to be able to set their tuition according to what the market will bear. [B4.]

HEADLINE: Bonds Mixed as Profit Taking Cuts Short Potential Rallies

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
As concerns eased somewhat over the credit market's ability to absorb the week's $44.5 billion in new notes and bonds, prices of Treasury securities finished mixed yesterday in a choppy trading session.
Profit taking for the most part cut short potential rallies, a couple of which were fueled by speculation that the Federal Reserve was in the market yesterday buying 2-year, 5-year and 10-year notes. It is not unusual for talk of a ready buyer in the market, like the Fed, to cause prices to rise and yields to fall. 
 Analysts said they believed that the Fed, which does not comment on such actions, was in the market buying notes on behalf of some foreign central banks.
The price of the newly issued 30-year bond fell 3/32, to 9823/32, for a yield of 6.09 percent.
Tony Crescenzi, director of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, a New York brokerage firm, said the market activity reflected efforts by dealers to lighten their holdings of newly issued securities. Dealers typically reduce prices on the new securities to make them attractive and clear out inventory accumulated from the auctions.
"Today's price action is consistent with the bond market's behavior since early December," Mr. Crescenzi said, "and that is we are in a relatively narrow trading range, whether it is price or yield."
On Thursday, the Treasury completed its quarterly auction, selling a record amount of new 3-year and 5-year notes and 30-year bonds.
In the eight refundings since 1993, the price of the long bond has in six instances gained almost half a point within a week of the refunding's end.
Many traders expect yields to decline further next week as the market remains optimistic that the Fed will continue to cut short-term interest rates, with the objective of stimulating a weak economy. And as long as inflation remains low there is room for interest rates to go lower.
Larry Berman, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said the market's next step was to look toward future releases of economic data. "The market is trading with some breathing room, so it's now time to establish some upside momentum," he said. "With no data and no auctions, only customer flows, some buyers may step in to get their feet wet to do some buying."
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said the trading range in bonds would continue until economic weakness became pronounced or a credible agreement to balance the Federal budget was reached.
"There is a tug-of-war in the bond market," Mr. Sohn said. "Cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the face of a worrisome economic condition support bonds. On the other hand, lack of progress in Washington over budget matters is eroding confidence."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Edges Up Against Yen And Mark in Choppy Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed yesterday after a day of choppy trading.
The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen and the German mark after its fluctuations through Asian, European and North American trading. 
 Much of the day's activity focused on mark-yen trading, with the dollar caught in the middle. Fluctuating United States stock, bond and gold markets also buffeted the dollar.
"It was a tug-of-war for the dollar," said Charles Spence, the director of Treasury sales for the Standard Chartered Bank.
In other trading, the British pound fell sharply against the mark and the dollar late in the day after news of a bomb blast in London, which came shortly after an Irish radio report that the Irish Republican Army had ended its cease-fire.
At 4 P.M. in New York, the British pound was at $1.5305, down from $1.5378 on Thursday. In later trading, the pound fell as low as $1.5310.
The pound had been weaker earlier in the day on profit taking and concerns about Britain's Conservative Government remaining in power.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 1.4872 marks, up from 1.4755 on Thursday and slightly higher than last Friday. It finished at 107.05 yen, up from 106.95 yen on Thursday and about half a yen higher than a week earlier.
"The dollar got a good rise after going through its weeklong correction" on concerns about the United States economy, Mr. Spence of Standard Chartered said. "Then it slowly clawed its way up."
Active trading among foreign currencies "was part of the reason we saw some of the moves" that kept the dollar bouncing, he said.
Thursday's announcement of Japanese Government efforts to send more investments abroad continued to hurt the yen. Yen sales bolstered the mark and gave the dollar some of its support.
"That's what pushed the dollar over 107 yen" and initially "kept the dollar from breaching 1.48 on the mark," he added.
Also underpinning the dollar was the mark's fall in trades with the Finnish markka as the Finns intervened in the market to bolster their currency, Mr. Spence said.
Comments by German monetary officials concerning interest rate cuts there wound up having little if any impact on the market, analysts said.

HEADLINE: NATO's Plans Threaten Start II

BYLINE: By Mikhail S. Gorbachev; Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet President, heads the Gorbachev Foundation, a research institute.

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
The Senate's ratification of the Start II treaty is supposedly a sign that the United States respects its nuclear disarmament commitments and that it intends to push Russia to do the same. But many in Moscow think the real objective is to disarm Russia as soon as possible.
The problem is the American double standard: a demand for disarmament while disrupting the balance of power by pushing NATO's ill-conceived plans to march toward Russia. 
 Expanding NATO's umbrella, including its nuclear weapons, to cover Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary -- moving NATO's frontiers some 400 miles closer to Moscow and the Russian heartland -- is seen as a fundamental violation of Western guarantees after Russia dissolved the Warsaw Pact and agreed to German unification.
Many in the West see NATO as benign. But Russians see it as something that didn't change with the end of the cold war -- as a war machine that is trying to take advantage of our troubled political and economic situation. The fear, realistic or not, is that the West or some politicians in the West want to deliver a coup de grace to the Russian Federation and eliminate forever a Russian challenge to United States dominance.
The result, of course, is that Russian defense officials are loath to endorse any new cuts in their missile forces. Not surprisingly, the Russian Parliament may refuse to ratify Start II, which calls for slashing the American and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals to about a third of their cold war levels.
Although some hard-liners in Washington and Moscow might welcome this, the demise of Start II would be a terrible blow to nuclear disarmament and worldwide hopes for nonproliferation. Already the friction over NATO and Start II is undermining what is left of Russia's confidence in the West and helping our ultra-nationalists in their bid for presidential power.
There is a real danger that we'll restart the arms race. I wouldn't be surprised if the nuclear-security card was resurrected in the coming elections in both Russia and the United States.
Legitimate questions remain to be answered. In particular is the question of the role to be assigned to Russia in the so-called Partnership for Peace.
Disarmament continues to follow the logic of the negotiations begun in Geneva and Reykjavik from the reduction of medium-range missiles to Start I. This approach had a positive effect on all the other international actors, including those tempted by nuclear ambitions.
The two great superpowers stipulated rules of conduct that the others could not overlook. But since then we have witnessed the disappearance of the Soviet Union. The consequences have been destabilizing. The geopolitical role of Russia has changed drastically. But instead of working together to handle this new situation, some in the West have attempted to ruthlessly exploit the strains and weaknesses in Russian policy.
On top of this, France has resumed nuclear testing, China has reserved the right to test and even the United States is considering the possibility of new underground explosions. (Incidentally, why did America react so feebly to the French tests? Could the Americans have used the French tests to perfect their own nuclear weapons?) Why should other countries adhere to nonproliferation if the main members of the nuclear club continue to rely on atomic bombs as a way of achieving their objectives?
If smaller nations see the big powers engaged unscrupulously in the arms trade, it should come as no surprise that they do the same, as buyers and producers. Not to mention that a buildup of arms in one place leads to a race to rearm in another place, especially if the countries have a common border.
If the United States sells arms to Pakistan, it should not be surprised when India responds by testing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and with a show of modern weapons. And we shouldn't be surprised by a New York Times headline on Feb. 7: "China to Buy 72 Advanced Fighter Planes From Russia."
What is to be done? Pursue policies that genuinely correspond to the challenges of the time, mobilize the United Nations and repudiate saber-rattling. We must continue nonstop with disarmament, adhere strictly to nonproliferation treaties and make their verification provisions even tighter, put an end to the uncertainties concerning the prohibition on new nuclear testing and avoid provocative moves such as the development of an anti-missile defense system.

HEADLINE: No Big Bank to Call Its Own;
Does Los Angeles Need a Financial Powerhouse?

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 9

 BODY:
A pall descended over this usually upbeat city after Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco succeeded in its hostile takeover of the First Interstate Bancorporation, the last big bank based here. Coming on top of a series of natural and man-made disasters, and the departure last year of the area's two professional football teams, it seemed like the final insult.
The initial result will be predictable and unpleasant. About 8,000 to 10,000 well-paying jobs will evaporate just as the Southern California economy is emerging from a painful recession. Floors will be vacated in First Interstate's office towers downtown, where the commercial real estate vacancy rate is already a hazardous 20 percent. 
 Then, there is the feared loss of the bank's financial support of community institutions, as well as millions of dollars of work for lawyers, accountants and other suppliers of services.
These days, the largest locally controlled commercial bank based in Los Angeles County -- which has a population of 9.2 million -- is City National, an institution one-fourteenth the size of First Interstate. Many out-of state and foreign banks also have large operations here.
But to a surprising degree, there are people who regard the takeover as almost a positive reflection of a deep transformation of the region's economy. On balance, they say, it does not bode ill for the future of Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city -- even if it has become a satellite city in financial industries dominated by New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
"Over the next three to five years, we'll see this as part of a process of creating a more diverse economic base, a more diverse employment base, a more diverse credit base," said Stephen J. Trafton, chairman of Glendale Federal Bank, a savings and loan institution that expects to capitalize on the banking shake-up.
The business landscape of greater Los Angeles has moved from a centralized economy dominated by big companies like aerospace manufacturers -- and banks -- toward a highly dispersed economy propelled by small businesses, many in entertainment and the electronic media.
Certainly, a strong financial presence here would add jobs, but the lack of a big financial headquarters is not holding the area's economy back, experts say.
And that touches on the deeper lesson in the takeover: the experience of Los Angeles is foreshadowing developments that will influence the American economy in the years ahead, with growth and innovation coming increasingly from smaller, younger businesses.
"Given a choice, sure, I'd like to see Wells Fargo headquartered here," said Eli Broad, a civic leader and chairman of the SunAmerica Corporation, a big insurance and financial-services company. "But they're smart enough to understand this area. They're going to have offices where the business is. Ultimately, it will have little, if any, impact on the community."
Many here say that at one time Los Angeles would have been in trouble if it had just lost its last big banking headquarters. Large banks financed large companies in a way more modest-sized banks could not.
But times have clearly changed. Now, big companies go to the markets for most of their capital needs, and heightened competition means that they can pick up the telephone and approach just about any bank when they need credit or other banking services. Many big banks are dispersing their operations in pursuit of lower costs, which means that they are less concentrated in their hometowns than they had been years ago. First Interstate, for instance, has had its computer center in Arizona and its loan-processing center in Oregon.
Some executives here say that Los Angeles was probably a little crowded with banks, anyway. Certain other big markets, including metropolitan areas in Texas and Arizona, have seen their leading local banks acquired by outsiders, and those economies have thrived and banking services improved with new services and competition.
For individual customers, the competition here is so keen here that most people will probably not feel much of a difference.
Glendale Federal has been running humorous radio ads trying to win customers away from the merged banks, saying that service will deteriorate and emphasizing its own cool Southern California agility.
"This is one of the most competitive banking markets in the country, and we've been trying to turn the heat up," Mr. Trafton said.
Robert S. Attiyeh personifies the civic and business difficulty that the First Interstate takeover represents here. He is president of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association, and he fears that Wells Fargo will not support the Music Center or local cultural institutions, preferring to put its money into its hometown.
And Mayor Richard J. Riordan has said he is concerned that the bank will support more activities near its San Francisco headquarters. "I think he's right," William F. Zuendt, the Wells Fargo president, conceded in an interview.
But Mr. Attiyeh is also the chief financial officer at Amgen, a leading biotechnology company that typifies the new, knowledge-intensive economy, and in that role he said that the news is not necessarily bad.
"Will we get by" at Amgen? he asked. "Yes. "Other major national players are going to be much more aggressive here, and smaller banks are going to grow. The city is not going to be underbanked, and we may even benefit from the competition."
And he added that though the downtown area might be hurt, the notion of a city's downtown was becoming something of a relic. "Is there a downtown in Silicon Valley?" he asked. "There's a lot of wealth creation, a lot of innovation, but there's no real center, no downtown. Los Angeles is a lot like that."
Indeed, Mr. Attiyeh's own company, less than 16 years old, is situated in Thousand Oaks, an outlying area just beyond the San Fernando Valley and about 40 miles from downtown.
And Mr. Zuendt of Wells Fargo said: "My personal opinion is that a place like Los Angeles should not be focused on major companies. Its growth is coming from the huge number of smaller companies."
Wells Fargo has adapted to that pattern by becoming the country's largest lender to small business in recent years, and it intends to continue the push, he said.
Still, it may take residents some time to accept the loss.
"It's all about the aura of Los Angeles," said Carol E. Schatz, president of the Central City Association. "It just looks like a loss of prestige for us."

HEADLINE: Stock Up on Rumors At Warner-Lambert

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The stock of the Warner-Lambert Company jumped yesterday on takeover speculation, but the company, a drug and consumer products concern, merely reiterated that it was reviewing some of its smaller business lines for possible sale.
Warner-Lambert ended up $5.75, to $98.75, after rising as high as $100 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the takeover speculation. The company, based in Morris Plains, N.J., has said it is determined to remain independent.
Analysts also linked the stock's rise to a presentation by company executives on Thursday at an investment conference, and to investors' purchases of so-called defensive issues, including drug makers, that would fare better if the economy slowed further.
At the conference, executives outlined the drugs Warner-Lambert is developing and focused on two for which they will seek regulatory approval later this year: troglitazone for diabetes and atorvastatin, which lowers cholesterol, analysts said.
Aside from the vague takeover rumors, investors speculated about a possible sale of Warner-Lambert's Tetra, a maker of food for pet fish, which had sales of $230 million in 1995.
Reiterating statements company executives made last April, a spokeswoman said the company was considering selling Tetra and other noncore assets to focus on its pharmaceutical, consumer health care and confectionery businesses.
In addition to drugs, Warner-Lambert makes Halls cough drops, Listerine mouthwash, Schick and Wilkinson Sword razors and Trident, Chiclets and Dentyne gum.

HEADLINE: No Time to Cut Head Start

 BODY:
A new report reconfirms the long-term benefits of early childhood programs like Head Start that Congress is trying to cut. Lawmakers should study it before slashing these programs.
Head Start is a comprehensive early childhood development program that gives low-income children educational and social skills needed to succeed in school. The program gives its 3-to-5-year-old participants health and nutrition services and offers social services to their families. It also places heavy emphasis on parent involvement. 
 Even though Head Start is the most successful of the Great Society programs, it has come under attack over the years. Several studies have indicated that initial gains made by Head Start children on intelligence tests are not sustained.
That was not the program's promise. The new report, by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation's Center for the Future of Children, emphasizes the long-term educational and economic gains that make Head Start and other preschool programs for disadvantaged children worth the investment.
The foundation's researchers culled results of nearly 150 studies to conclude that children exposed to early childhood education have higher reading scores, are less likely to be held back a grade or put into expensive special education classes and are more likely to graduate from high school than those who are not. In addition, participants in preschool programs are less likely to go on welfare or become involved in the criminal justice system.
Still, only 35 percent of all low-income children are enrolled in preschool programs. But the need continues to grow. Thirty years ago, only 19 percent of children under the age of 6 needed additional care because one or both parents worked. In 1995, the figure had jumped to 66 percent.
Congress wants to cut Head Start's $3.5 billion budget by 4 percent, or $137 million, this year. By contrast, President Clinton proposed a $400 million increase. The Packard Foundation report indicates Mr. Clinton is right.

HEADLINE: South Africa Campuses Reap Racial Enmity

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Timing their protest with a meeting of the directors of Witwatersrand University, a group of black students and university workers gathered recently in the administration building on campus here.
While they ululated and waved signs with slogans like "Stop Ethnic Cleansing at Wits Now," a group of white students leaned over a balcony high above and watched for a while. Then, indifferent, they walked away. 
 During this country's many years under an apartheid Government, the white professors and students at "Wits" often allied themselves with blacks, speaking out even when it was dangerous to do so. The school's administrators risked jail to keep black students, albeit a small number, in the classrooms and dormitories, and it was routine for them to be hauled before bureaucrats who threatened to cut off their financing.
But these days, as South Africa blossoms under its first freely elected black-led Government, students, faculty members and administrators say that South Africa's most prestigious university has never been more divided racially.
Across the country, many of South Africa's key institutions, for decades under white leadership, are trying to fit into a South Africa where the black majority is finally coming into power. But it is often a painful process, exposing the huge financial and cultural gaps that have existed between the races in this country and leaving raw feeling on both sides.
Many blacks say they feel the campus -- with an overwhelmingly white faculty and administration -- has not done enough fast enough. They want more remedial help. They also want a new structure for the school that will give them and the other large black campus constituency -- the janitors and cafeteria workers -- a say in how it is run.
At Witwatersrand the transformation process has grown especially vicious, with some professors and a black administrator now feuding almost daily in the newspapers, accusing each other of everything from racism to lying on their resumes to tax evasion. The disputes have attracted the attention of Government officials and prompted newspaper columnists to thunder both for and against how the university's administration is handling change.
The turmoil recently led the university to take out advertisements to reassure prospective students. The ads said that, as in the United States, the universities that first committed themselves to civil rights were the ones with the worst ethnic tensions.
Part of the problem is that the two sides have utterly different perspectives. The administrators think they are being generous. The students find them patronizing, saying that Wits, despite its liberal bent, thrived under apartheid and has a lot to make up for.
"The problem with liberals is that they believe they are good people and that they shouldn't be questioned," said Russell Ally, a history professor who supports the black students. "Some of them really believe they led the struggle. They don't think they have to change.
"On the other side are the students, who say: 'Stop wanting to be congratulated. If not for apartheid, black students wouldn't need all this and the money you have is made from the work of our parents. This is reparations, not a favor.' "
Wits has changed a lot in the last few years. The number of blacks enrolling has grown steadily; nearly 40 percent of the newest class is black. (Blacks are about 73 percent of the population.) The university has created programs to help the black students bridge the gaps between the poor education they received under apartheid and the tough courses they are taking. This has been done without any extra Government financing, so the school has paid for it by cutting back departments, keeping faculty salary increases below the rate of inflation and trying to raise private donations.
In his 11th-floor office overlooking the sprawling campus, Robert Charlton, who has headed the university since 1988, recites these accomplishments with pride. He is confounded by the hostility.
"If you look at the halls of residence, they are pretty classy," he said. "They get enough to eat and they get money to spend. The contrast to what it is like at home for them is enormous. There are plenty of people around here who didn't have it all made for them."
But many blacks find the school insensitive. Kwena Mathatho, 26, the chairman of the student union, said his efforts to get financial aid are typical. He came here to study law in 1992, the year his father, a migrant worker, died. His mother lives in a rural area where few blacks have electricity and most survive on subsistence farming and a few cattle.
When he applied for financial aid, he found it difficult even to document his parents' income, as the school insisted, since copying machines and income tax returns were hardly part of his mother's world. When he finally submitted everything, he said, he was virtually called a liar. "They said they couldn't believe that anyone could live on this," he recalled.
Finally, he said, he was able to break the stalemate by having a white doctor who was treating his mother write a letter in his defense. But in the meantime he went eight months without any financial support. To eat, he said, he passed out leaflets on the street.
Mr. Mathatho said that although the school has greatly increased the number of blacks it accepts, the number that drop out without a degree is enormous -- he guessed 60 percent. The university says that it has no figures on this, but that no student who is passing is excluded for financial reasons.
Some of the worst disruptions on campus occurred last spring over the university's attempts to dismiss a black cafeteria worker who was accused of letting students through the line without paying. At one point, frustrated black students stormed the office of the registrar and held him hostage for most of the day.
They were arrested. Then, when the university tried to dismiss the worker and expel the students, there were more protests. Backing down, the university demoted the worker and suspended the students for a year.
Again, said Mr. Ally, the history professor, the two sides saw the incident very differently.
"The administration," he said, "thought this was an issue of principle: 'You take hostages, that's it.' But the students and workers were thinking: 'If black people are prepared to forgive you for apartheid and everything that went with it, why are you taking such a hard line? There was no loss of life.' "
More recently, much of the squabbling has surrounded the hiring of a black administrator, William Makgoba, a South African who had been head of research at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London. He was recruited in 1994 to help the university become more welcoming to blacks. But in October 13 faculty members sent Mr. Charlton a letter questioning Mr. Makgoba's competence and accusing him of falsifying his resume. The letter was leaked to the press.
In retaliation Mr. Makgoba, who as deputy vice chancellor for administration has access to personnel files, made them public and accused many of the complaining professors of dodging taxes and misusing research funds.
Arguing that Mr. Makgoba had abused his office, Mr. Charlton suspended him. But under a torrent of pressure from black students, workers, the Minister of Education and others, he reinstated him. The University is now setting up a panel to review the mess.
Wits is certainly not the only South African university in turmoil. Under apartheid, the country had separate high-quality English and Afrikaans universities and a host of universities for blacks, most of which were notoriously dysfunctional.
The Government has not yet decided what to do about all these schools. Some are struggling to reform on their own. Last week the University of the Western Cape, a traditionally black school, closed because of student protests. The university is in financial trouble because it has admitted many new students who cannot afford the tuition, and the student protests were over the school's announcement that it would bar delinquent payers from classes.
This week, protesters at the Afrikaans University of Stellenbosch trashed the campus over the university's efforts to cut costs by privatizing cafeteria services.
The one university that seems to have avoided major disruptions is Cape Town, another prestigious, formerly white-run university. Last October, the university chose Dr. Mamphela Ramphele to take over as head later this year. In Dr. Ramphele, the university was able to find a black woman of indisputable academic standing -- she is a medical doctor with a Ph.D. in social anthropology -- with an unquestionable record as an anti-apartheid activist.
The university began trying to remake itself more than 10 years ago and hired Dr. Ramphele to lead that effort five years ago. It has already set up a new governing system that gave all campus constituencies -- including students and workers -- a say in choosing Dr. Ramphele to head the school. But officials say they hardly feel out of the woods.
With eight applicants for every place, the Cape Town administration has decided to be tough on those who are not keeping up academically. This, they say, could easily lead to student unrest.
At Wits these days, Mr. Charlton consoles himself with the fact that the university has not yet missed a day of classes. But he still finds his new role -- no longer the liberal hero but now the administration bad guy -- befuddling.
"I just don't understand," he said. "Why should we be targets now? We were targets for 40 years. Maybe we need sensitivity training, I don't know."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
N.F.L. Gives Modell a Ticket to Baltimore

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 9

 BODY:
"Where've you guys been for the past three months?" Art Modell asked reporters today, in his first public appearance since November, following the National Football League owners' decision to let the team formerly known as the Cleveland Browns move to Baltimore. "It's good to be back."
The team's relocation, which goes into effect immediately, plus the N.F.L.'s promise to provide Cleveland with a new team called the Browns by 1999, was approved by 25 owners, 2 more than the required three-quarters majority of the 30 teams. Pittsburgh and Buffalo voted against the deal, while Oakland, St. Louis and Arizona abstained. 
 "It was a necessary evil," said Roger Headrick, president of the Minnesota Vikings.
Lamar Hunt, the Kansas City Chiefs' owner, added, "I was not in favor of the move, but I was in favor of the ultimate resolution."
Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, called the deal "the end of a very emotional and difficult time."
"To the fans of the Browns, you can count on us that the Browns will be there in 1999," he said.
The deal nearly collapsed on Tuesday with Modell's resistance to paying Cleveland any more than $2.5 million in damages from lost rent, taxes and other revenue. "We had to be made whole," said Fred Nance, a lawyer for the city of Cleveland.
"I never thought it would get done," said Robert Weber, Modell's lawyer. "I wasn't impressed with the city's recognition of modern-day sports economics."
At his coming out, after a torrent of vitriol and numerous death threats sent him into exile in Palm Beach, Fla., Modell expressed a mixture of relief at the resolution and a continued belief that Cleveland's politicians failed him.
"I wouldn't do anything differently," he said. "I'm proud that I showed as much patience as I have."
Citing the city's financial commitments to build Jacobs Field, the Gund Arena and the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame, he said, "I wanted and was promised equal treatment and it wasn't forthcoming." He flayed the news media and politicians who "fed the passions of hate" against him.
Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White, a leader in the fight to keep the Browns in Cleveland, said: "What has been done has been done and has been rectified. We have received redress. It's time to look to a new day."
Modell said he did not expect the enormous outcry that followed the announcement that he would move.
"I didn't expect the outrage," he said. "I kid Bud Adams" -- the owner of the N.F.L.'s Houston team, who is moving his franchise to Nashville -- "that he had 65 people protesting the Oilers' move, and 30 were relatives looking for money."
Asked when moving vans would pack up the team's belongings for the trip to Baltimore, Modell said, "When they come back from L.A.," a reference to the Seattle Seahawks' proposed move to Southern California.
The league's nine-page agreement with Cleveland sets precedents that may have to be repeated as more N.F.L. teams seek their fortunes in other cities.
The league has agreed to borrow from $28 million to $48 million to help pay for construction of a 72,000-seat, natural-turf stadium in Cleveland, which an expansion or relocated team will make its home. The owner of a new Cleveland team will repay the loan with interest. The league has agreed to make "every effort" to tell Cleveland if it intends to expand there by Nov. 15, 1997.
"If you do it for the Browns, why don't you do it for the Seahawks?" said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp., a Chicago consulting firm. "What's interesting is the backfill. Do you put a team back into Houston after they move? Or Tampa Bay? Or Seattle?"
In Houston, the Oilers have a deal to move to a Nashville stadium in time for the 1998 season. Asked if the N.F.L. would lend money to help build a new stadium in Houston and guarantee a replacement team, Tagliabue said: "We'd consider it. The question is, are people prepared to do what Cleveland has done, to come through with funding and turn a renovation plan into a new stadium?"
Regarding Seattle, Tagliabue sounded bothered about the Seahawks' owner Kenneth Behring's abrupt decision, which violated a league resolution that Behring signed last year giving the N.F.L. control of the Southern California market.
"It's a serious concern on my part and by ownerships, picking up and moving their practice facility to Southern California," he said. "The Seahawks are the N.F.L. team in the Pacific Northwest. Practicing in Southern California doesn't go far in representing us in the Pacific Northwest."
Al Davis, the Raiders' president of the general partner, said the resolution was illegal "and I don't know if you are allowed to appropriate a market for yourself." Later, he said his team still controls that market.
Davis called the Cleveland deal "selective, discriminatory."
"Someone has got to pay for it," he said.
He said Cleveland did not meet the league's relocation guidelines, which Modell championed and used to argue against Raiders' moves around California. He said today's meeting grew contentious when he raised his objections. Tagliabue said Modell's petition to move "did not meet all the guidelines," but the deal with Cleveland overcame those problems.
Modell will pay the league a $29 million relocation fee -- paid for by the Maryland Stadium Authority's sale of $80 million in permanent seat licenses, or upfront payments to buy season tickets -- and forgo some future expansion fees.
Is it fair, Modell was asked, that his actions deprive Cleveland of N.F.L. action for three years?
"It's not the end of the world," he said. "Baltimore waited for 13 years."
 
 
 
EXTRA POINT
 In other business Friday, the N.F.L. owners approved extension of the collective bargaining agreement through 2002. It moves the uncapped year from 1999 to 2000 in time for the free-agent signing period, which begins Thursday.

HEADLINE: Police Arbitration Bill Deserves Pataki's Veto;
How Much Productivity?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Feb. 6 news article on anger expressed by New York City police officers at Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani: Mr. Giuliani says the city cannot afford raises for its police officers, although he and his aides have now received theirs. As the wife of a police officer, I know that officers have not had a raise in about as many years. 
 Mayor Giuliani says that he would consider police raises in exchange for an increase in productivity, and applauds the police for the remarkable decrease in crime in New York City. How much productivity does he want before agreeing they merit a raise?
We still have a majority of ethical, hard-working police officers in the city, but as their rate of pay continues to lag behind inflation, we must remember that we get what we pay for.

U.S. Assails Japan Over Music Copyrights

 BODY:
The United States complained yesterday to the World Trade Organization that Japan was failing to comply with an accord to protect foreign music copyrights, costing American producers $500 million a year. The move starts a process than could lead to trade sanctions against Japanese exports to the United States. 
 The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, announcing the complaint, said in Washington that the United States had raised the issue with Japanese officials 13 times, "but to no avail." The complaint to the W.T.O. in Geneva is the first step in the trade group's dispute settlement procedure. If the claim is ultimately successful, the United State will be entitled to impose tariffs on Japanese imports to make up the $500 million loss. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: TELEVISION VIEW;
'Seinfeld,' an Odd Place That's Just Like Home

BYLINE: By Jeff MacGregor; Jeff MacGregor is a humorist who has written for and about television for 20 years.

 BODY:
THE COMMODIFICATION OF popular entertainment is as old as show business itself. Recent archeothespic investigations at the Globe Theater in London, for example, suggest that while on-site sales of Shakespeare's Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow Perpetual Desk Calendar were quite strong, the post-performance numbers for his "My Progenitors Went to 'Coriolanus' and I Received Naught but This Motley Jerkin, Withal!" T-shirts were not what they might have been.
In post-modern Hollywood, of course, this noble tradition of peripheral profiteering long ago superseded the bothersome production of any actual entertainment. A movie or a television show is now just the ceremonial jeroboam broken across the bow of a newly launched merchandise Leviathan. Witness NBC's "Diet Coke Playhouse," formerly known as "Friends," the hairstyle-driven, self-cannibalizing hitcom that proves once and for all that in marketing, nothing exceeds like excess. 
 The business of America is, after all, show business, and all good citizens must do their bit to stimulate our nation's economy. Thus, it is alarming, and quite possibly seditious, that NBC is missing a sure bet by failing to exploit properly its recently renewed megamonster comedy "Seinfeld." While tremendously profitable, the show isn't nearly overexposed enough; hence its continued success as the zaniest Zeitgeist on prime time. But there's a lot more money to be made there, a golden goos' to be killed and cooked, so it's high time something be done about it. Herewith, then, a modest proposal that all NBC executives should clip and save for their next board meeting: Six Flags Jerry.
That's right, Six Flags Jerry. A "Seinfeld" theme park, where the theme is, naturally, absolutely nothing (unlike the Reality Tour being offered in Manhattan by the "real" Kramer -- which is, being a Reality Tour, about $27.50 worth of something).
Think of it. Millions of tourists and devoted fans flocking in year after year. And every one of them a high-rolling member of television advertising's most attractive demographic subset: 18 to 49. Expecting what? Expecting nothing, and lots of it! Once in Orlando (where else?), fun seekers would arrive at the park via Monolog rail, a newly refurbished subway car in which Jerry's irreverent show-opening observations are played continuously. By the time visitors land at Guest Services, they'll be repeating "Ever wonder why . . . ?" just like a pro. (But they had better keep their eyes peeled for that roly-poly ol' Animatronic Weatherman, Al Roker, or he just may steal their complimentary gyro!)
After queuing for several hours only to learn that their rental-car reservations didn't actually reserve them rental cars, guests will be whisked away in Jon Voight's old Chrysler to begin their stay in 5,000 deluxe replicas of Jerry's very own apartment.
Imagine their delight at being able to explore at last this simultaneously strange and familiar environment. To reach out and touch the hanging bike that Jerry never rides. To discover the titles in his 10-book library or play one of his never-opened CD's. Or to 'ine as they please at the in-room, all-U-can-eat cereal-and-bottled-water bar. To learn finally the forbidden secret of what lies hidden behind Jerry's bedroom door.
Following a good night's sleep (as Masters of Their Own Domain), the guests wil' be off to explore the 400-plus acres and 42 theme attractions that make up Six Flags Jerry. Each tour begins with an orientation lecture by the first-sacker-turned-socio psychologist Keith Hernandez, in addition to a written personality test (hint: the right answer is almost always "Junior Mints"). Lecture topics will include "The Cosmo, the Id and the Superego," "Men Are From Mars; Lainey's From Your Subconcious," "On Dating, Jerry and You: A Can't-Quite-Commitcom," "I Am Curious (George)" and " 'Seinfeld' at the Millennium: More Laughs or Just Prostate Trouble?"
For the less-athletic visitor, the next stop may be the Benesphere, a 20-story domed exhibition hall. Built in the shape of Elaine's diaphragm, it houses hundreds of interactive displays. Here one can visit the Hall of Mirrors That Make You Look Fat, or run screaming, with a pocketful of mutton, through a computer-generated kennel.
GUESTS CAN ALSO TRY THEIR hand at placating a holographic Mr. Pitt, experience what it's like to go slowly insane working for J. Peterman or let one of the perky Benesphere attendants show them how to toss their hair for distance and accuracy while saying "Hellooooo" to a handsome stranger. (Guests who plan to visit the 700,000-square-foot Gallery of Guys Who Got Away should allow two days. Special time must be set aside for the Meditation Gardens, site of the J. F. K. Jr. Eternal Torch.)
More adventurous souls may opt instead for a hair-raising thrill ride at Parking Space Mountain in Costanzaland. Or they can plumb the foul depths of George's self-esteem by plunging into the bowels of the Looks Don't Matterhorn. Only the very bravest among them will risk a voyage through the troubled waters of Parents of the Caribbean, a simulated two-week holiday cruise with George's mother and father. It's not all terry cloth and terror, though. There'll be daily betting pools for guesses on the exact time George will break his engagement. And every great day at Costanzaland ends at the band shell with a cocktail-hour performance of the all-new musical "Pride of the Damn Yankees," starring Jason Alexander as Lou Gehrig and Jerry Lewis as George Steinbrenner. (Mandy Patinkin appears as Billy Martin's ghost.)
Should a visitor to Six Flags Jerry ever feel peckish, he can visit one of the 19 Tom's/Monk's Restaurants throughout the park. From tuna sandwiches to chicken sandwiches and, well, back again, guests can enjoy the same fine food the "Seinfeld" cast eats every week. (This is also the best place to spot long-gone characters like Baboo!) A recommendation? Try the big salad! And for those on a tighter budget, three words: strolling soup Nazis.
The park's centerpiece will be the multimillion-dollar Cosmo's Cosmos. Based on a map of Columbus Avenue and CAT scans of Kramer's brain, Cosmo's Cosmos will be the nation's first and only wall-to-wall virtual-reality experience. After obtaining releases from their physicians and lawyers, visitors will receive sharp blows to the head with a persimmon 3-wood wielded by Newman (Newman!) and set loose on the streets. For the next several days, they'll see the world as an actual hipster doofus does. (Field trips to vintage-clothing stores, driving range and fruit stand included.)
And Jerry Seinfeld himself? He'd make just one live appearance a week, Mondays at 2:30 P.M., arguing with the park's dry cleaner about a broken button on his puffy shirt. That alone ought to be worth the price of admission.
On second thought, forget it. Six Flags Jerry already exists; it's called the Upper West Side. And 's Shakespeare teaches us, "All the world's a stage, but the real money's in feature films."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN:;
Lima

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS; CALVIN SIMS is chief of the Buenos Aires bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
At the beginning of the 1990's, few foreigners dared set foot in Peru for fear of terrorism, cholera and street crime, all of which were rampant throughout this Andean nation. But now, with Peru undergoing a dramatic turnaround in its political and economic situation, tourists are arriving in droves. Last year, a record 485,000 foreigners visited Peru, a 26 percent increase over 1994. Cholera is under control, terrorism is in decline with the capture of the leaders of the Shining Path movement, and the economy is on the rebound.
Last year, after a government crackdown brought a sharp drop in the number of terrorist attacks, the State Department stopped warning American tourists of the dangers of travel in Peru. Although a New York woman was recently sentenced to life in prison for her illicit association with a Peruvian terrorist group, State Department officials said Americans have nothing to fear in visiting Peru and interacting with its citizens.
 
 While most tourists travel to Peru to see the lost Inca city of Machu Picchu, visitors must first pass through Lima, the capital, which is undergoing a rebirth that many Peruvians hope will restore the luster that terrorism dimmed.
Nowhere is this renewal more evident than in the Miraflores, San Isidro and Barranco districts, which are buzzing day and night and are full of surprises. New art galleries, bars, restaurants, taverns and night spots have opened in these districts, and there is now an active night life where several years ago many Limenos did not venture out after dark.
The best time to visit is during the Southern Hemisphere's summer, now through April, when the city enjoys bright sunshine and cool nights. Although most tourists pass through without incident, street crime, especially pickpocketing and purse-snatching, are still common. Lima officials advise tourists to travel in groups, and not to wear flashy jewelry or otherwise call attention to themselves.
 
 
 
Events
 The Peru Negro Ballet, acclaimed in Europe and Latin America, symbolizes the best in Peruvian black music and dance and is performing this year at the Manos Morenas restaurant, (511) 467-4902, fax (511) 467-0421, 409 Pedro de Osma, in Barranco, on Wednesday and Thursday nights at 10. Admission is $15 and includes a typical meal of fish, seafood or stewed meats.
In Peru, the grape is a cherished fruit, the source of fine wines and a classic cocktail called the pisco sour, which is prepared with grape brandy, lemon, sugar, egg white and ice. No wonder Lima's working-class district of Surco holds an annual grape harvest festival. This year's, from March 13 to 20, includes wine tastings and street fairs. For information, call (511) 477-2325.
 The Instituto Riva Aguero, 459 Camana, will present an exhibit entitled "The Blacks of Peru" during March, from 2 to 8 P.M. Monday to Friday. The exhibit will recount the experiences of the first blacks to arrive in Peru from the Antilles and the Caribbean.
Cultural and artistic events are often announced only a week or two before they occur, so visitors are advised to check listings in The Lima Times, published on Friday.
 
 
 
Sightseeing
 The heart of the city is the Plaza de Armas, or main square, which contains a variety of Colonial government buildings and churches, notably the Government Palace, also called Pizarro's House, which has a colorful changing of the presidential guard at 12:30 P.M. The plaza also contains a spectacular 17th-century cathedral, open Monday to Friday, 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. and 2 to 5 P.M., and Saturday 10 A.M. to 3:45 P.M. The cathedral is outstanding for its intricately carved choir chairs, 17th-and 18th-century paintings, and altars. On the streets surrounding the plaza are many Colonial buildings with exquisite wooden balconies.
Lima has a striking coastline, called the Costa Verde even though it is actually brown and not green. The best view is at the end of Ave nida Larco in Miraflores, where the entire Pacific coastline from Chorrillos to La Punta is visible. Down below is a succession of beaches with sports fields, private clubs, discos and expensive restaurants. In summer the beaches are packed with sunbathers and surfers, though some of the waters are not clean.
Perhaps Lima's most romantic neighborhood is Barranco, once a wealthy beach resort and now home to many of Peru's best known artists and writers. Its tree-lined streets leading to the sea front, Colonial-style mansions and houses, and tranquil plazas evoke times past. The Puente de Los Suspiros (Bridge of Sighs) is a picturesque lookout.
A good way to experience Peruvian folk music and dancing is to visit a pena, a small night club, open from 11:30 P.M. till dawn. Popular ones are: Sachun, 657 Avenida del Ejercito, (511) 441-0123, Miraflores; Brisas del Titicaca, 168 Jr. Wakulski, (511) 423,7405; and La Estacion de Barranco, 112 Pedro de Osma, Barranco; no telephone. Admission is $5 to $10.
Lima has many celebrated museums, including the splendid National Museum of Anthropology and Archeology and the Museo de Oro, a dazzling collection of Inca and pre-Inca gold. The most impressive of Lima's many archeological sites is Pachacamac, a vast pre-Inca and Inca site 18 miles south of Lima on the Pan American Highway. The spot is dedicated to the Pachacamac god known as the maker of universe, and has a large adobe pyramid built in A.D. 1350, a reconstructed "temple of the virgins," and a small museum. Pachacamac is reachable by car or taxi or with tours arranged at major hotels and travel agencies. The ruins, (511) 430-5607, are open daily from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. Admission $1.50; there are guided tours in English.
If you fancy hand-carved, Colonial wooden furniture of the style that once graced Peru's castles and fine houses, visit the Taller de Arte Colonial, 110 Malecon Castilla in Barranco, (511) 467-7589. This factory, open Monday to Saturday 9 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. and from 3 to 7 P.M., has an impressive collection of chairs, chests, dining tables, picture frames, and other furniture at reasonable prices. Visitors can watch the craftsman at work or view a superb model collection of wooden passenger jets representing the major airlines of the world.
 
 
 
Where to Stay
 All hotel prices in Peru are subject to a value added tax of 28 percent.
The 134 spacious, pastel-toned rooms at El Olivar, 122 Merino, (511) 221-2121, fax (511) 221-2141, in a tranquil section of Miraflores, have a view of the Olivar Forest. Doubles are $180.
At Hotel Ariosto, 769 La Paz, Miraflores, (511) 444-1414, fax (511) 444-3955, a double room with breakfast and tax is $147. The clean, efficient hotel has a small but inviting lobby and 110 rooms simply decorated with Colonial furniture.
The Lima Sheraton, 170 Paseo de la Republica, (511) 433-3320, fax (511) 433-6344, has 498 rooms, at $185 for a double. It is downtown in a noisy, high-crime section.
Budget: The 83 rooms of Hotel Jose Antonio, 298 Avenida 28 de Julio, Miraflores, (511) 446-8295, fax (511) 446-6705, have double or king-size beds and basic furniture. Rooms on the seventh and eight floors have views of the ocean. The lobby is modern, with large windows. A double costs $121, including tax.
El Marques Hotel, 461 Chinchon, San Isidro, (511) 442-0047, fax (511) 442-0043, has 42 Spanish-style rooms with Colonial furniture. The hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood but close to a commercial center. A double is $85.
Luxury: Hotel Las Americas, 415 Avenida Benavides, (511) 444-7272, fax (511) 444-1137, is a modern high-rise, centrally situated in the garden suburb of Miraflores. It has 151 pastel-colored rooms with teak furniture and Peruvian prints. The lobby bar and fifth-floor lounge are cozy. The hotel has a small gym and pool, and is a short walk to the beach. A double is $236, including tax.
Cesar's, corner of La Paz and Diez Canseco, (511) 444-1212, fax (511) 444-4440, is a quiet luxury hotel with a spacious lobby, homey tea room, a pool and sauna in Miraflores near shopping and business districts. Its 150 rooms have traditional wood and leather furniture. A double is $262, including tax.
 
 
 
Where to Eat
 Peru has a rich, diverse cuisine dating back to the ancient Incas, with Spanish, African, Chinese, Italian, Japanese and European influences. There are dozens of variations of spicy fish, shellfish, stewed meat, tamale and potato dishes. In the past few years, many excellent restaurants have opened in Lima.
Francesco, 524 Malecon de la Marina, (511) 442-8255, overlooking the beach in Miraflores, serves innovative seafood dishes. The seafood lasagna, fish in cognac sauce and octopus tamale are exceptional. Francesco is open Monday to Saturday noon to 5 P.M. A meal for two including drinks is about $50.
For ancient Lima cuisine, El Senorio de Sulco, 1470 Malecon Cisneros, (511) 441-0389, offers a sampler that includes cau-cau (tripe and potato stew), olluquito (a spicy vegetable stew), and sangrecita and frijoles (bull's blood and beans). The owner is an anthropologist devoted to preserving traditional Peruvian cooking. The restaurant, which has a grand ocean view and terrace, is open daily noon to midnight. Dinner for two with wine is about $60.
Costa Verde, Barranquito Beach in Barranco, (511) 477-2424, considered one of the best international restaurants in Lima, is right on the ocean. It has an enormous and varied buffet and also serves classic dishes like ceviches (sliced raw fish seasoned and marinated in lemon juice). The restaurant is open daily, noon to midnight, and dinner for two with wine is about $180.
Lima has hundreds of chifas -- restaurants serving Chinese food with a local twist. Royal, 231 Avenida Prescott, San Isidro, (511) 442-9547, serves Cantonese-Peruvian cuisine and is open daily 11 A.M. to midnight. Try the chicken rolls filled with asparagus in oyster sauce. A meal for two is $70, including wine.
Peruvians love chicken, especially roasted or fried, and Pardo's Chicken, 730 Avenida Benavides, (511) 446-4790, has a reputation for preparing some of the best. A complete chicken meal, with beer and dessert, costs about $17. Open Monday to Thursday and Sunday, noon to midnight; Friday and Saturday noon to 1 A.M.
From January to April, ice cream is an event unto itself at 4D (Cuatro D), 400 Avenida Angamos, (511) 447-1523, Miraflores. This ice cream factory and parlor offers rare fruits like maracuya, granadilla and guanabana, many of them available only in Peru because they are too fragile to ship abroad. A cone of this soft ambrosia costs about $1.50. Open Monday to Thursday and Sunday 8 A.M. to 12:30 A.M., and Friday and Saturday 9 A.M. to 1 A.M.

Quiet, Tender Moments Of Urban Melancholy

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg 

 BODY:
IF YOU DO NOT KNOW Roy DeCarava's name, you are probably in the majority. His only previous retrospective in a New York museum was 25 years ago at the Studio Museum in Harlem, although he has had shows since then in other cities, and even one in Sweden. A book of his photographs was published in 1981, and "The Sweet Flypaper of Life," his 1955 collaboration with Langston Hughes, was reprinted in 1984. Other than that, not much. He has been very particular about the conditions under which he would exhibit his work, so perhaps this neglect is not entirely th' fault of an ignorant world.
Whatever the reason for so glaring an absence, it has been amply repaired at the Museum of Modern Art with 184 pictures in "Roy DeCarava: A Retrospective," organized by Peter Galassi, chief curator of photography. (After the show closes on May 7, it will travel to Chicago, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Houston, San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington and Andover, Mass.) 
 This large dose of black-and-white photo graphs represents close to a half-century of continuous endeavor. The pictures, seldom grand in subject or sweep, are quiet, poised, bafflingly dark, suffused with stillness: glimmers of domestic gentleness and recurrent melancholy in metropolitan life. (Appropriately Metropolitan Life Foundation is the major sponsor of the show.)
They do not falter often, except perhaps in the nature studies and the more consciously arty pictures; most of them quietly and surely distill personality and emotional temperature from minor gesture and unthinking stance. In addition, DeCarava reads the city's small secrets as it goes about its business unawares, and comes in so close that everything outside his concentration falls away$ He has a knowing way with both acerbity and symbolism, but his tone is generally one of tender affection for, or resigned acceptance of, a decidedly imperfect world.
That world is mostly, though not exclusively, where blacks live and work. Roy DeCarava, an African-American and lifelong resident of New York City, has trained his lens primarily on black experience and to a lesser extent on city life in general. Today it is hardly unusual for black photographer-artists like Carrie Mae Weems and Adrian Piper to comment on African-American life and history, but DeCarava came out of an essentially silent era.
Born in 1919 and aware that he wanted to be an artist from the age of 9, he was a painter and printmaker of images of black life before switching to photography in the late 1940's. There were not many black photographers at the time, other than studio photographers like James VanDerZee and the late Austin Hansen, who performed a valuable function but made no claim to art. They were little known outside their community until the civil-rights movement and the "Harlem on My Mind" show at the Metropolitan Museum in 1969 brought black cultural history to the world's attention. Just about the only black photographer with any claim to national prominence in the 1940's and 50's was Gordon Parks, portraitist and photojournalist; art photographers were virtually unknown.
In fact, photojournalism and art photography were seldom ambitions of African-Americans until quite recently. Photography is an expensive habit and has not been much more available than tennis to city children of any color who were not solidly middle-class. Besides, there were not many role models to look up to. In 1952, DeCarava was the first black photographer to win a Guggenheim fellowship; one wonders how many had applied before. Black artists did not even regard photography as an art. As recently as 1993, Romare Bearden and Harry Henderson's history of African-American artists did not mention DeCarava.
Then there was his choice of subject matter. Harlem had been photographed frequently but, as his wife, Sherry Turner DeCarava, points out in her essay in the exhibition catalogue, only for commercial and documentary reasons. In his Guggenheim application, DeCarava wrote, "I do not want a documentary or sociological statement, I want a creative expression, the kind of penetrating insight and understanding of Negroes which I believe only a Negro photographer can interpret."
Of course, the camera is a documentary instrument by its very nature, but DeCarava's personal archives consist of interior states and evidence of individual character culled from the most minor and unexpected clues: the way a man plants his feet or climbs a stair, the distance between two people.
The question of whether only a black could tell the true story of Harlem I leave to those embroiled in the controversy over whether only a black director could film the life of Malcolm X (and who were unhappy with the movie). But DeCarava certainly had extraordinary access and shared experience, none of which would have mattered so much had he not had the talent as well.
DeCarava also wrote in his grant application that he wanted "to show the strength, the wisdom, the dignity of the Negro people." Like all insightful observations of groups, this enterprise ended up illuminating the human condition. His pictures of domestic life in the tenements are a fond poem to the tangled sweetness of family and daily existence. They moved Langston Hughes to write a story about a woman who refuses St. Peter's messenger because she wants to see "what this integration the Supreme Court has done decreed is going to be like."
DeCarava himself suffered plenty from discrimination and astutely compresses this communal history into individual glancing encounters on the street. "Boy, Man and Graffiti," 1966, catches a white boy moving forward, a black man turning his head, his mouth open in uncertainty, and a crudely drawn, weeping skull. In "Woman, White Scarf," 1961, a white woman seen up close in the light is wrapped in chiffon and smugness; a black woman's face, furrowed with worries, fills the darkness just behind her.
DeCarava clearly understood the aspirations, obstacles and psychological costs his subjects encountered; better still, he knew how to inscribe them within a small rectangle in a fragile state of poise. In "Graduation," 1949, a girl in a long dress and gloves walks in a wedge of sunlight past the litter and rubble of an abandoned lot; in the shadow she heads toward, a Chevrolet advertisement says "Style Star of an All-Star Line."
He understood the nature of achievement as well; witness a series of fine portraits of jazz musicians. Louis Armstrong, duded up, strides gigantically down a Harlem street with his mouth open in joy, a king sashaying across his concrete kingdom. "Coltrane on Soprano" shows the great saxophonist pouring his soul into his instrument, which has mutated into a dancing flicker of lights.
DeCarava's desire to show "the strength, the wisdom, the dignity of the Negro people" was the direct outgrowth of the first movement to proclaim black beautiful, in the first quarter of this century. As blacks moved out of the South en masse and discovered that discrimination was very much alive in the North as well, a heightened sense of common identity developed. Cutting across economic and class distinctions, this feeling of racial community helped foster a movement to establish the value of black culture for blacks and whites alike.
THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE of the 1920's, with its outburst of African-American writers and artists, was one result. In 1928, as George Hutchinson points out in his recent book, "The Harlem Renaissance in Black and White," the editor of the National Urban League's magazine said in a speech that younger black Americans had a "compulsion to find a new beauty in their own lives, ideals and feelings."
"The new generation of Negro writers and artists have led the way," the editor continued. For the poets among them, no life is without beauty and no beginning too low.
DeCarava, born as this movement was taking shape, was its natural heir. As he came of age in the 1930's, black visual artists were coming into their own. In 1935, the Museum of Modern Art mounted the first major American museum show of African art, a source of great pride among blacks. And in 1937, the Baltimore Museum of Art put on the first museum show of black American artists.
The Works Progress Administration, a Federally financed program, supported black artists as well (or as minimally) as white ones during the Depression and gave them long-denied opportunities for expert training and immersion in current esthetic issues. DeCarava himself obtained a position in the W.P.A. and for a time went to the Harlem Community Art Center, a genuinely communal center for all the arts, including drama and literature.
Once he found photography, in the 1940's, he gravitated toward a distinctive range of middle tones, nearly eliminating black. Such grays! Graphite and charcoal, the world seen through a glass darkly, the subjects slowly emerging to view, with gleams of isolated light like revelations, on a hand, a hanger, a watch band. Some of his pictures are so dark as to court invisibility; there are mysteries there that the glass over these pictures unfortunately makes even more difficult to plumb.
Yet the darkness speaks. "Hallway" is an image of an underlighted, dirty, slightly menacing tenement hall; somehow DeCarava has extracted a mournful lyricism from this unlikely source. He once said that he himself didn't understand how this thing that was "ugly and brutalizing" had turned into a beautiful photograph. He decided that the process was "part of the seduction that's involved in art, I think, when you start with reality and make something else of it." This is something else -- and so is DeCarava.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Into the Municipal Maelstrom

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Ken Lipper, New York City's (and maybe the world's) best-connected screenwriter, tells a story about his introduction to the relentless deal-making that goes on behind the scenes in municipal politics, the milieu of his new film, "City Hall."
The year was 1983, and the scene was a small Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village. Mr. Lipper, just appointed deputy mayor for economic development by Edward I. Koch, had been invited to lunch by the legendary party boss of Brooklyn, Meade H. Esposito. 
 "An absolutely charming man, expansive, sweet, funny, a little wicked, one of the more beguiling people you'd want to meet," says Mr. Lipper, who has been a lawyer, investment banker, philanthropist, chief executive and gazillionaire -- not, in other words, someone likely to need a beginner's lesson in anything.
But Esposito saw otherwise. His agenda that day, apparently, was to persuade Mr. Lipper to support a city subsidy for a Brooklyn boat builder, Coastal Dry Dock, which was threatening to leave New York for Alabama unless it received help in paying its electrical bills. But Esposito barely mentioned Coastal, except, Mr. Lipper recalls, for a brief moment of gentle pressure: " 'Ken,' he said, 'I'm not telling you what to do, but you should at least go out and meet with them. They're good people, Ken. They're citizens. They pay taxes. You've got to give them an electricity break, or we're going to lose all these jobs to Tuscaloosa."
Mr. Lipper says he told Esposito merely that Coastal would be given a fair hearing, and when the waitress brought the $38 check, well over the $5 limit on gratuities that officials were allowed to accept, Esposito tried to sign it.
Mr. Lipper picks up the story: "I say, 'You can't pay for that,' and he says, 'O.K., you made your point. Now be courteous. I invited you.' I say, 'That's all well and good, but you can't pay for it.' So he looks up at the waitress, gives the check back, and says: 'Put a cutlet in the bag for the wife. The jerk's paying.' "
As a rebuke, it was wry but firm: learn the rules, kid. But Mr. Lipper recalls it as a characteristic moment: "I don't want to give the impression that I'm above anything, but there is no limit to how careful you can be."
That is precisely the lesson of Mr. Lipper's screenplay.
In the film, which opens on Friday and stars Al Pacino as the Mayor of New York, a casual political favor involving a fixed probation report for a mob-related drug dealer is exposed when the dealer is killed in a shootout that also claims the lives of a police officer and a child. Well-intentioned people and substantial lives in public service are destroyed because of back-room deals that seemed harmless when they were made.
(Although Mr. Lipper's original ideas for the story dominate the film, his actual words do not. Several screenwriters followed him on "City Hall," and Mr. Lipper took the issue of who should get credit to the Writers Guild of America for arbitration. In the end, he prevailed. The credit reads, "Written by Ken Lipper and Paul Schrader & Nicholas Pileggi and Bo Goldman.")
In addition to Mr. Pacino, the $45 million film, directed by Harold Becker (whose credits include "Sea of Love"), stars John Cusack as the idealistic Lipper-like Deputy Mayor, Bridget Fonda as a lawyer for the slain police officer's family, Martin Landau as an unfortunate, beleaguered judge, and Danny Aiello as the Brooklyn party boss, based in part on Esposito and in part on Donald R. Manes, the Queens Borough President who committed suicide after his involvement in a 1988 corruption scandal was revealed.
Mayor Koch has a small role as a television commentator, and Mr. Lipper makes a cameo as the City Council president. The casting is ironic in that Mr. Lipper left the Mayor's office in 1985 after only two years to run for the council presidency (a job now called public advocate) and, after a vitriolic campaign on both sides, was soundly beaten by Andrew Stein.
"This time I got the job by acclaim," says Mr. Lipper, and it's hard not to note that he has himself corrected history in a rare instance over the last 30 years when his confidence -- even hubris -- has not been rewarded with success.
Ken Lipper, the second son of a Bronx shoe salesman, won a full scholarship to Columbia, graduated from Harvard Law School, changed careers after six months as a lawyer, earning a partnership at the Lehman Brothers investment bank at age 31, and, in 1976, moved to Salomon Brothers, quadrupling his salary.
Living in the upper echelons of power, Mr. Lipper is now a Rockefeller Brothers Fund trustee, and his own investment concern, Lipper & Company, begun in 1986 to handle his family's money, manages $3 billion in assets.
He is a consultant to the Clinton Administration on the Federal budget, and his friends (according to a list he provides) include former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance, Senators Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina (who has a role in "City Hall"), and the actor Michael Douglas and the director Oliver Stone, with whom he worked as a consultant on the 1987 film "Wall Street." Since then he has entered a film production business in partnership with Edward R. Pressman, the veteran producer of "Wall Street"; together, they produced "City Hall."
And that isn't all. Overwhelmingly successful financially, Mr. Lipper married money before he made it. He met his wife, Evelyn Gruss, on a blind date while he was at Harvard Law School and she was a freshman at Simmons College. (She is now the head of the child development division at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center; they have been married nearly 30 years and have four daughters.) The philanthropic donations of her father, Joseph Gruss, an oil and gas magnate who had escaped the Nazis in Poland, totaled more than $300 million at his death in 1993.
 Mr. Lipper entered politics in 1982 when, at the behest of the consultant David Garth, he joined Mr. Koch's unsuccessful campaign for Governor as an economics adviser. He was named to the administration during the second of the Mayor's three terms. It was a time when the city had just emerged from economic crisis, and Mr. Lipper was charged, in the words of Paul Dickstein, then the city's deputy budget director, "with jump-starting an economic development program."
To a significant extent, he succeeded. It was the height of the real estate boom in Manhattan; commercial space was at a premium, rents were soaring and businesses were being driven off to the foreign ports of New Jersey and Connecticut. Mr. Lipper's strategy was to develop commercial office space in the boroughs outside Manhattan, using tax breaks and other subsidies to interest builders and lure companies to the new buildings.
Among other things, he was a strong advocate of Teleport, a Staten Island industrial park built around a telecommunications center. Planned since 1979, it was to open in 1983, but in a move that Mr. Koch cites as typical of his deputy mayor's aggressive supervision of the city coffers, Mr. Lipper single-handedly held up the project for a year in order to renegotiate a nearly done deal with the city's co-developers, p'rticularly the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority was then headed by Peter Goldmark, now president of the Rockefeller Foundation.
"Peter Goldmark was going to walk all over us, and Ken wouldn't let him," Mr. Koch says.
Perhaps not surprising, it was a success that came with a reputation for arrogance. Among his chief critics is Mr. Goldmark, who to this day is blistering in his private assessment, although he will not speak about Mr. Lipper on the record at all except to say that the version of the Teleport story that casts Mr. Lipper as the hero "is not at all accurate."
"City Hall" is after a high degree of verisimilitude. For the first time, the actual City Hall building was rented as a film set, the result of a policy-reversing decision last year by its chief inhabitants, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Speaker of the City Council, Peter Vallone. (The $50,000 fee is being applied to renovations at City Hall.) And it was Mr. Lipper, still a senior adviser to the City Council, who made sure the actors had access to the local denizens, including the Mayor.
Mr. Cusack, who took time to observe the behavior of some New York political specimens while preparing for his role, was struck by their passion for secrecy. "Whenever they go to meetings, or to a breakfast or anywhere, they shake hands, hold on and whisper," he said. "There's always some exchange. It's like a virus all these people have -- always a handshake and then a close, ear-to-ear whisper -- people telling secrets all the time, right in front of everyone."
There are limits, however. Mr. Cusack says he isn't really playing Mr. Lipper; indeed, his character, Kevin Calhoun, an Irishman from Louisiana, is hardly a Bronx Jew. One of the film's running jokes is that Kevin has a hard time with the Yiddishisms he hears around him, particularly menschkeit, literally "a man's code of behavior," used to refer to the unspoken rules by which politicans conduct their bargaining.
"It was a word Stanley Friedman always used to use," Mr. Lipper says, referring to the former Bronx Democratic leader who went to jail in 1988 for his illegal involvement in the sale of computer software to the city's Parking Violations Bureau, the same scandal that brought down Mr. Manes.
And even though Mr. Pacino borrowed from Mr. Koch the mannerism of riding in the Mayoral limousine with his head tilted back in exhaustion, his character, John Pappas, is not modeled on Mr. Koch. The paradigm, Mr. Lipper says, is not a mayor at all but Creon, the tragic monarch from Sophocles' "Antigone," whose impossible choice is to yield his authority as king or put to death his beloved niece for willfully defying a cruel edict.
Characteristically grandiose, Mr. Lipper says he conceived the theme of "City Hall" after seeing a performance of "Antigone" Off Off Broadway in 1988. "It suddenly struck me: that's the core of government experience," he says. "He orders her to death, against all of his feelings, all of his will, but he does it to prevent anarchy. He has great moments of ambivalence. It was that sense of frustration versus duty that intrigued me about the government."
Kevin Calhoun may not be Ken Lipper, but there is a scene in "City Hall" in which the script credits the character with the same tenacity and righteousness. In it, Frank Anselmo, the Brooklyn party boss, calls Kevin "a reed."
"Blow on him, and he bends," Anselmo says. To which the mobster replies: "Not this kid. This one's different."
Kevin, of course, is the story's hero. Which brings us back to Meade Esposito. At some point after their notable lunch, Mr. Lipper took up the case of Coastal Dry Dock, in the end denying the pleas of both Esposito and another advocate in the case, Representative Mario Biaggi of the Bronx, for the city to grant the company an energy subsidy.
Eventually, Coastal went out of business, leaving a $300 million Pentagon contract unfulfilled, and Esposito was convicted of bribing Mr. Biaggi. But not until Esposito's trial in 1988 did the world learn that at about the same time he'd had lunch with Mr. Lipper, Esposito had paid for a Florida vacation for Mr. Biaggi; the jury ruled the vacation was an illegal gratuity for Mr. Biaggi's attempted influence on behalf of Coastal Dry Dock. That's why Esposito and Mr. Biaggi went to jail.
During Esposito's trial, Mr. Lipper was called to the stand. Among other things, he was asked: who paid for the lunch?

My Life: A Proposal

BYLINE: By Polly Frost; Polly Frost reviews movies for Elle magazine and is currently working on a play.

 BODY:
TODAY marks the beginning of the 10th year I've spent on my novel "Dripping." Still convinced it will encompass everything I've learned from Chekhov, those exquisite small epiphanies in which nothing happens and all is revealed. To think there are those who don't realize how hard it is to achieve this mixture of mysterious everyday realism and emotional reticence! Especially in a passage like this:
He was setting down the money for his drink and putting on his coat. She had no reason to be happy, for he had just told her he didn't love her, and yet she heard the music from the jukebox and saw the lights from the taxis on the avenue and she felt overjoyed. Thank God she had remembered to take her Paxil. 
 Then I hit my readers with scenes of senseless East Village crimes and unprotected sex.
Ready to discuss novel with Michael, agent extraordinaire -- at least the three chapters so far finished. Phone machine tells me to contact him on AOL. When did publishing get so up-to-date? Send E-mail reminding him who I am; he messages back a time we can meet in a private chat room.
Downloaded transcript follows:
Michael: The market moves on. Even five years ago you could still get away with the downtown Manhattan female sex thing. But the only literary form I can sell now is the memoir.
Me: Memoir! I thought that was something you did at the end of an august literary life.
Michael: Today it's the best way to start a career. Think "The Liars' Club," by Mary Karr. Think Susanna Kaysen's "Girl, Interrupted." Readers are interested in:
l real lives
l real traumas
l real dysfunctionalities.
So work with me here. Have you ever been
(1) raped?
(2) abused by a family member?
(3) institutionalized?
Me: No, no and no. But I am beginning to feel extremely depressed.
Michael: I can't take on any books about depression. It's been overdone. Get back to me when you have something we can work with.
Take to my bed. 2 A.M.: Wake up with the chilling thought that I may be in this studio apartment in Murray Hill forever. Begin reviewing my existence in Michael's terms. Start by trying to remember the names of my childhood playmates. . . . Realize that I became a writer to escape reality.
Time for an amorous break from my literary anxieties! Should I meet with RufNReady on AOL or CarverFan on Echo? CarverFan great on lit chat, but his idea of foreplay is to ask if I can get my agent to look at his book proposal. Opt for Ruf: says he's a grizzled 45-year-old Wyoming woodsman, my very own Legend of the Fall. We've had sex in every possible cyberposition. Only downside is Ruf's postcoital habit of rhapsodizing about Dean Koontz. No, I admit, I didn't know that the villain of "Whispers" became a psychopath because he'd been locked up in a cellar with thousands of roaches. Ruf lets slip that he also admires R. L. Stine. Could my wild guy be a few years younger than he's claiming?
Ruf messages that he must sign off, while I remain hungry for more. Log on to Echo and search for CarverFan. He coaxes me into a heated discussion about how big an advance Mary Karr will get next time. Thank God for literate people!
Set to work. Buy copies of Karr and Kaysen. What to do about guilt feelings? Normally support local independent store but can't resist 30 percent off at Barnes & Noble.
What I need to include:
l no-holds-barred truthfulness
l opening shocker
l mean relatives (make sure they're dead -- so can't sue)
l description of depressing childhood home
l major trauma.
Review own background.
Drawbacks:
l Mom never hit me
l Dad never jailed, never drank too much, never abused me
l never a teen-age bulimic, anorexic or alcoholic
l never slashed wrists
l never had a vicious dog that was taken away to die.
Usable:
l Mom made me wear lots of pale orange clothes -- a color that makes me look sallow
l Mrs. Felson, baby sitter who forced me to watch reruns of "Lawrence Welk"
l was chronic cookie-dough eater
l dog refused to participate in musical I wrote for her to star in, called "Snoozy in Paris."
How confusing it is to be a professional writer.
Examining my nonlife, realize I must be repressing horrible secret that would fascinate millions of readers, and visit trauma recovery specialist. Miraculously, she elicits painful, hidden memory:
I am a child who has been left in a strange place. There are other children here. We are all wearing rags and eating porridge. I am so hungry that when I finish mine I get up and ask an adult for more. And then there is singing all around me. . . .
Have breakthrough sex-and-lit chat with CarverFan. Says I have every reason to hate my family. According to CF, there is no greater cruelty than banality. How dare my parents not give me anything to write about!
5 A.M. Wake up at desk. Eeeeeek: never logged off. There goes budget -- will have to take review copies to Strand. E-mail proposal to Michael. Download follows:
My memoir will knock every other autobiographical account off the shelves and onto the remainder table. I am going to expose the kind of trauma that can force a child to withdraw completely from the world and into her imagination. This is the book that will tell all about what I confidently predict will be the hottest of all dysfunctionalities: fiction addiction.
Here's a sample passage:
"Don't leave me with Mrs. Felson, Mom, please!" But it was no use. Mother was determined to go to the PTA meeting.
I grabbed "Nancy Drew" and ran to my room.
Highlights will include:
My Lasting Scars.
A Metaphor for America -- I can't think of a better one than my mom's Sting Ray convertible.
A Major Revelation -- My parents recently confessed that they hired Mrs. Felson because she charged less than other sitters. They claim they put the money they saved in a college fund, but I have evidence that they used it to get away for a weekend in Hawaii.
"I can't possibly sell this," Michael responds.
Despair. Must retreat from city and repair artistic soul. But last time was in Adirondacks ran into no one but neo-Luddites with anti-technology book proposals. So log on to AOL and beg Ruf to let me share his mountain existence with him for a while. Make love again and again, until my carpal tunnel syndrome returns. Ruf logs off, telling me there's a bear in his cabin. I suspect it's really his mom.
Return from cyberwilderness experience refreshed and determined. New plan: platform my personality across multiple media. Adaptability is everything in the new literary economy!
E-mail proposal to Michael:
This is the TV lit talk show that will combine the best of Charlie Rose and Sally Jessy Raphael.
POSSIBLE FIRST SHOW LINEUP:
l Judith Regan
l Michael Korda
l Sonny Mehta.
THE ANGLE: I won't interview them; they'll interview me. Every show will be full of Chekhovian epiphanies about my life.
Log off, confident that Michael won't be able to resist. Feel usual post-triumph lustiness. CarverFan or RufNReady? Decide to go with Ruf. So what if he's 12? He knows how to handle a real woman.

QUEEN OF BOHEMIA
The Life of Louise Bryant.
By Mary V. Dearborn.
Illustrated. 365 pp. Boston:

"I do wish sometimes I were as shallow as a Louise Bryant; everything would be so simple." This is a line of Emma Goldman's, written in 1922. Her reference is to her own overwhelming sense of tragedy at the course of the Bolshevik Revolution, and to Bryant's blithe response to the same events. 
 This is real disdain, not even personal but generic. And since Goldman was not alone among Bryant's contemporaries in her opinion, Mary V. Dearborn, the author of "Queen of Bohemia: The Life of Louise Bryant" and no disinterested scholar, sees the existence of a conspiracy of envy, meanspiritedness and "gender politics" to keep Bryant from her rightful place in history. Ms. Dearborn contends that "a great irony is at work here: in spite of, or even because of, her great contemporary impact, her presence has barely been recorded" by history. "Recovering her story," Ms. Dearborn promises, "discovers a true 20th-century heroine . . . who has, ironically, been overlooked by traditional history and nearly lost to legend."
Not so. Louise Bryant's life is well documented. But I also confess here to a weakness for Emma Goldman (accused of many things, but never before of meanspiritedness to my knowledge), and also to an aversion to the promiscuous use of irony.
Louise Bryant was born in San Francisco in 1885 and raised in Nevada. Her social and economic circumstances were fairly marginal. Bryant (she used her stepfather's name) grew up to be a bold young woman, beautiful, smart, ambitious and inclined to scandalous behavior. Ms. Dearborn sees her as a natural freethinker struggling against the bonds of bourgeois morality.
In 1909, after college, Bryant went to Portland, Ore., where she landed a job on the weekly Spectator, covering the doings of the city's elite. That same year she married Paul Trullinger, a dentist from a rich, prominent family. Ms. Dearborn admits that his money and status were not unimportant to Bryant: "For if Louise was a freethinker, she could also be a bit of a social climber." This is not, Ms. Dearborn quickly adds, "as contradictory as it seems at first consideration." Because "as much as she wanted to be free of social convention, she recognized that it was easier to do so if you were thought to come from a 'good' background. On one level, she could simply get away with a lot more. On another, she had determined at an early age to improve her lot, and if vaulting ahead in class would enable her to do that more easily, she had no problem with it." Am I missing something here? Are there two kinds of social climber?
As a young matron, Bryant maintained a separate studio in downtown Portland, kept her job and gave martini-drinking and ether-sniffing parties in her husband's office. But she was restless. She had made some connection to the world of radical bohemians through the woman suffrage movement, and also through Portland's resident libertarian, Charles Erskine Scott Wood. When John Reed, who had been a protg of Wood's, came to Portland at the end of 1915, Bryant made a play for him. He was already a celebrated radical journalist, dashing and romantic. Bryant was 31, told him she was 27, and gave him the strong impression that she was a woman who had achieved prodigious artistic and professional success. They began a love affair and she soon left Dr. Trullinger in her dust.
Bryant joined Jack Reed in Greenwich Village in the first days of 1916. Far from being lost to history, her life among the Village radicals and bohemians shows up in many biographies of the period and has even made its way into the movie "Reds": her tumultuous four-year marriage to Reed, her involvement with the Provincetown Players, her affairs with Eugene O'Neill and others. (She overcame O'Neill's reluctance to betray his good friend by telling him that Reed was impotent; when Jack confessed to a brief infidelity of his own, she became totally distraught and brought the marriage to a crisis, all the while continuing with her own affairs.)
In August 1917, a reconciled Louise and Jack sailed for Russia. From this trip came Reed's classic "Ten Days That Shook the World" and Bryant's "Six Red Months in Russia" (she was actually there only four months). Her book has gullible schoolgirl charm and inherent interest as a document, though it is not a serious work of reference.
Ms. Dearborn, however, strains to take it very seriously. Referring to one of Louise's typically hyperbolic assertions, she writes that it "may seem like an overstatement; it may even have seemed so to Louise as she made it." But, she adds, Bryant "may have found that to her delight and amazement it might well have been true." To which one can only say, "Huh?"
Bryant came back from Russia by herself, ahead of Reed, and at once began an unsuccessful attempt to renew her affair with O'Neill. Again Ms. Dearborn offers one of her bemused analyses: "Although her actions usually had an internal, idiosyncratic logic, at various points in her life they appear bizarre or inexplicable."
Bryant was now a celebrated authority on Soviet Russia. Her book had been published, she was writing for the Hearst papers and, in a political atmosphere increasingly hostile to Bolshevism and home-grown radicals, she made speaking tours on behalf of the Revolution and of woman suffrage.
Jack Reed died of typhus in Moscow in 1920. Bryant was with him at the end, soon to be comforted by none other than Emma Goldman. After Reed's death she continued as a journalist for a time. (Ms. Dearborn tells us that Bryant's observations in Russia were more trustworthy than Goldman's, since "they were backed up by interviews with Soviet officials themselves"!) But her life had been shunted onto another track. At the end of 1923, when she was pregnant with their daughter, she married the very rich and social William Bullitt.
Ms. Dearborn is uneasy about this marriage. Has her heroine reverted to social climbing? "But was it really weakness to want to live well?" Ms. Dearborn wonders. "Though it seems at odds with her feminism, Louise cannot be faulted for participating in a reigning ideology that assessed a woman's worth according to her husband's."
Married to Bullitt (who thought she was 29; she was 38 by then), Bryant lived the life of a rich man's wife: houses, servants, parties, clothes. She drank too much. In Paris, she began an affair with Gwen Le Gallienne, a sculptor, and her marriage ended in a horrendous divorce. She developed the rare and disfiguring Dercum's disease. She lost custody of her daughter. She lost control of Jack Reed's papers. In the end she was a pathetic Paris character, telling stories of past and imagined glory. In 1936, at the age of 50, she died in a $2-a-night hotel.
No special pleading is needed to write Louise Bryant's biography. Hers was a theatrical life, filled with drama and tragedy, fascinating people and great events; it has an interestingly flawed protagonist. In fact, it has been written before, by Virginia Gardner, whose research seems to form the basis of Ms. Dearborn's book. What is original with Ms. Dearborn, the author of a life of Henry Miller, is some sort of feminist-radical agenda, but her arguments are so contorted (mirth-provoking, even) that they are a disservice to any political cause she might have in mind. Let's not even mention history or literature.

HEADLINE: She Made Them Dance

BYLINE: By Joan Acocella; Joan Acocella, the author of "Mark Morris," is now editing the English translation of Vaslav Nijinsky's diary.

 BODY:
One seldom has cause, these days, to complain that a new biography of a woman makes insufficient use of the gender card, but Carol Easton's life of Agnes de Mille is one of those rare occasions. In the 1940's, de Mille was, by her own account, "the best-known choreographer in America -- not the best, but the best known." Dance is a woman's field, but as de Mille pointed out, it was ceded to women only because men didn't consider it important enough to reserve it for themselves. Furthermore, the area in which she made her deepest mark was not concert dance, the women's preserve, but musical comedy a genre more dominated by men -- men who, furthermore, regarded dancing as employment for the backer's girlfriends. De Mille's struggle to be taken seriously in that world is a classic women's tale.
 She was born, in 1905, into an eminent family. Her grandfather was the famous economist Henry George; her father, a successful playwright and screenwriter; her uncle, Cecil B. De Mille. As she grew, she developed an excellent mind, a big nose and a rather trying personality -- combative, demanding, complaining. (In later years, several people, without consulting one another, nicknamed her Agony de Mille.) She spent her teen-age years sitting out the cotillion and writing poems and stories that her father critiqued. He wanted her to be a playwright. He also, she believed, wished she had been a boy, and she undoubtedly wished the same.
 
 At the age of 12, at an Anna Pavlova recital, she received the call to dance, but her father opposed this -- he too regarded dance as a bimbo occupation -- and she didn't start ballet class until she was almost 14. Her body was wrong for ballet ("big-busted, well-hipped," as she put it), and she had almost no gift for classical dance. Furthermore, she discovered that she was a natural comic, the antitheses of what at that time was the dying-swan image of the ballerina. But none of this deterred her from wanting to be a dancer and choreographer. Indeed, it spurred her on. Thus was born the theme of her life: embattlement.
 After a slow start -- typical for a woman -- she had her first big hit at 37: her cowboy ballet "Rodeo" (1942). Five months later came the premiere of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Oklahoma!," which she had choreographed, and she was famous. By 1944, she had three hit musicals running on Broadway. In all, she choreographed some 15 musicals and 21 ballets. (In between, she wrote 12 books.) In ballet, she was one of the makers -- together with Antony Tudor and Jerome Robbins -- of midcentury realism, the fusion of ballet technique with vernacular movement and modern psychology. On Broadway, she was a leader of a related revolution, the push to integrate dancing with song and story. If Mr. Robbins's 1957 "West Side Story" is what most of us think of as the archetypal musical-from-which-dancing-cannot be-separated, it was preceded by de Mile's "Carousel" (1945), which ended with a 40-minute ballet. And all of this was achieved in bitter conflict. In the 1940's the Broadway bosses still regarded dancing as the least important element in the show. De Mille was routinely asked to hire couch-cast non-dancers, to fit her work to sets that blocked the exits, to yield to every consideration other than that of dance. She fought back with fury. She screamed, she raged; she had nose-bleeds so severe that she had to be taken to the emergency room. Such behavior shortened her career on Broadway. (After their experience with her on "Paint Your Wagon,' Lerner and Loewe hired a different choreographer for their next show, "My Fair Lady.") Without the tantrums, however, she would not have achieved what she did.
 The warfare was not just external. The discovery that de Mille made in her ballet class, that she was a fat little comic in a world of swans, never lost its power to wound her. When she staged her first solo programs, she was dumbfounded, she says (I doubt it), to hear the audience laughing: "I had thought what I was doing was tragic...I wanted to do something that had beauty." This division spawned other, parallel conflicts. Her gift was for acting, for realism, yet what she wanted to create was dancing -- an alternative, symbolic language, like that her friend Martha Graham was inventing: "Martha moved; I grimaced." She was also torn between commercial theater and "art." In her glory years, she ran back and forth between ballet and Broadway, trying to convert ballet to Broadway's realism and Broadway to ballet's idealism.
 Added to these troubles was a further conflict: careerwoman versus "real" woman. In the 50's, it was widely assumed that if a married woman chose to have a career, there was something wrong with her and with her husband. Ozzie worked; Harriet stayed home. Many of de Mille's friends considered her unfit for marriage. "She had such drive," one of her dancers said, "you couldn't imagine her being sufficiently pliable to fit in with anyone else's life." (Imagine this being said of a man.) Nevertheless, in 1943 de Mille married Walter Prude, a debonair Texan who had been Martha Graham's manager and was later one of the top associates in Sol Hurok's office. From the begining, Walter made clear his resentment of Agnes's career, and as her fame grew -- in 1950 she made over $125,000 ($825,000 in today's dollars) -- so did his resentment. He liked to tease her, often in front of others, saying things like "I only married you because I thought I'd be killed in the war." He also took up with other women, or so she believed.
 Not surprisingly, she became hung up on sex. Her dances are heavily populated with hungry females searching for men. Dance itself, she wrote, was a sublimation of that hunger: "Dancing represents sex in its least costly form, free from imprisonment and free to a great extent from emotional responsibility, and, above all...independent of someone else's pleasure. In other words, it means freedom from sex."
 Creative women were bound to lose sexually, she felt. In a letter to her friend Rebecca West, who was grieving over her husband's infidelities, de Mille wrote that West's husband of course had to have a mistress, because he needed to have a woman inferior to him: "That's how it is, darling. Gifted women pay." Betrayal was not the only cost. De Mille repeatedly claimed that female dancers were "frigid," and she presumably had the same worry about herself. Remember that these were the days of Freudians telling women which kind of orgasm was the real kind.
 Carol Easton does not ignore the woman question, but in discussing de Mille's troubles she is more likely to use psychoanalytic reasoning, much of it is pretty lame. When de Mille dreams of marriage, this is "a fantasy with roots that reached back into her childhood, when her whole family had colluded in a fiction of who they were." Presumably, if something is wrong with your family, you shouldn't contemplate marriage.
 But in Ms. Easton's view, the enduring bugbear of de Mille's psychic life was her father, who refused to give her unconditional love. (He wanted A's, not B's.) Thereafter, with every faithless boyfriend, every high-handed boss, de Mille is seen to be re-enacting this primal frustration. When she takes Walter to "Oklahoma!" -- this was the first time he had ever seen her work -- and he refuses to say a single kind word about her dances, Ms. Easton concludes, "It did not take a Freudian to see that in her marriage Agnes had replicated her relationship with her father." In fact, it does take a Freudian. A reader unequipped with that perspective might conclude that the fault lay with Walter, or with history.
 De Mille was a choreographer of the second rank, maybe the third. No shame in that. Her specialty was sentimental comedy, then as now the public's favorite genre, and she fashioned it with wonderful intelligence. She was loved, furthermore, for her wholesome subject matter: monstalgia, patriotism, cute girls, nice fellers. When those themes went out of fashion, so did her work -- whereupon she embarked on a new profession. She became one of the most popular lecturers in the United State, thundering to audiences across the nation on dance, women's rights and the necessity for government support of the arts.
 In her old age, she joined that rather tiresome species, the Grand Old Gal -- a common apotheosis for briliant women (cf. Katharine Hepburn, Lillian Hellman) once time releases them from sexual troubles. She was grand, though. After a stroke that left her, at 69, paralyzed on the right side of her body, she went on working at a barely diminished pace for almost 20 years until her death in 1993. She was large-spirited too. Aware that her talent was inferior to Tudor's and Graham's, she never stinted in her praise of them. (The most valuable book on Graham is by de Mille -- "Martha," 1991.) If she was also a very trying person, maybe that's what good causes need.
 De Mille's best work was not her ballets but her writing, above all her first book, "Dance to the Piper" (1952), one of the finest dance autobiographies ever written. In her prose, as in her ballets, she was the master of the comic character sketch. Here is her portrait (from "Dance to the Piper") of her Aunt Constance, Uncle Cecil's wife and a woman of fable poise:
"I remember one April afternoon began for her with a children's hospital committee meeting that was interrupted by a hysterical summons from across Los Feliz Boulevard because of the drowning of a child in a nearby reservoir. She went to the victim's house, cleaned the house, prepared supper for the brothers and sisters, comforted the mother, returned, bathed and dressed, put in a brisk half-hour hunting flies and ants for her small son's neglected alligator, presided at the dinner table of her own children, sat with them while they studied, and at midnight was found trailing alone around the cellar in a red velvet negligee in search of the special Liebfraumilch which Cecil liked with his late supper."
 It's like a Buster Keaton routine. Incidentally, Walter, on reading the proofs for "Dance to the Piper," advised Agnes not to publish it. As Ms. Easton relates, he said "that the writing was not good...He also pointed out that she already had a career and didn't need another one." Shaken, she tried to get out of the contract. The publisher protested, and Walter finally came around. "Dance to the Piper" was an immediate best seller.
 D.W. Winnicott used to write about what he called the "good-enough mother," the mother who, while not ideal, nevertheless doesn't wreck your life. Carol Easton is a good-enough biographer. At times she seems naive. She does not discuss broad trends, such as Method acting and "midcult," that influenced de Mille's choreography. More important, she does not know enough about dance -- ballet versus modern, narrative versus "abstract," highbrow versus middlebrow -- to place de Mille's work in proper context, and she makes some amazing mistakes about ballet. (Her previous writing have been on music and movies.) Nevertheless, she takes de Mille seriously as an artist. For those who still wonder, as I do, how dance is made, she describes in detail de Mille's choreographic method: how she imagined a dance, what came into her mind first, how many notes and what kind she made before going into the studio. And throughout, Ms. Easton tracks de Mille's struggles with the limits of her gift. De Mille fans will want to read the book. Newcomers should get hold of "Dance to the Piper" instead. It's in print. The 50's being what they were, you won't find out about the bad love affairs or the Jewish grandmother, but you'll have more fun.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Equitable Life's Switch;
A Short Move, but to a Wholly Different Mindset

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
LATER this year, employees of the Equitable Life Assurance Company will start moving into 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Olympia & York's huge building on 52d Street. Physically, some will just trek across the street, while others will come from a few neighborhoods away. Metaphorically, they will travel much farther.
This move brings Equitable full circle in a long, eventful real-estate odyssey. The 137-year-old insurer has owned and occupied some of the city's biggest, most modern buildings. Now, other companies will occupy Equitable Center, the lavish monument Equitable built itself a decade ago. It will be a tenant, albeit the major one, in a more utilitarian building that someone else owns. 
 "The goal was to reduce costs and create efficiencies," said Jonathan D. Miller, a senior vice president of Equitable Real Estate. "The notion that Equitable needed to be in an owned property was dismissed."
Real-estate experts say that similar scenarios are being played out everywhere as shareholders and customers change the yardsticks by which companies are judged.
"C.E.O.'s indulged their egos with fancy headquarters because they got high marks for the appearance of success," said Arthur J. Mirante 2d, chief executive at Cushman & Wakefield, a real-estate firm. "Today, they get high marks for a healthy bottom line and the appearance of austerity."
For some companies, going downmarket is a sign of fiscal desperation. But many others simply emerged from the recession weaned of the need for frills. They will pay top dollar for efficient space; they will let others pay a premium for glitz.
"Equitable, I.B.M., AT&T, all finally viewed their trophy buildings as wasted assets that should enhance the bottom line," said Carol Nelson, executive vice president of the Edward S. Gordon real-estate firm.
Profiting from real estate is not a new idea to Equitable. Like most insurance companies, it invests in real estate and supplies mortgages for many types of properties, and has always made its headquarters do double duty as moneymakers.
Still, even among insurance companies, Equitable has been a trend setter. Its first "home" building, opened on Broadway and Cedar Street in 1870, was the first office building to have elevators -- and thus, one of the first to get good rents for space above the second floor. The 36-story tower it built itself at the same location 45 years later was one of the largest office buildings of its time.
Over the years, Equitable developed properties for its own use in St. Louis, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. Inevitably, when it ran out of space in New York, it turned to itself for the solution. In 1960, Equitable built the 1.8-million-square-foot edifice at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 52d Street, the largest building ever designed for occupancy by a single owner.
It was hardly a prestigious address back then -- "Sixth Avenue was more like Speakeasy Row than Corporate Corridor," recalled Timothy J. Welch, senior executive vice president of Equitable Real Estate. Still, the Time-Life Building had gone up just a block south three years earlier (partly with Equitable financing), and Equitable trusted that others would follow.
Its building was no cut-rate home site. Equitable eschewed outsourcing, employing its own staff to run every aspect of the building, from security to food service to maintenance. Equitable charged its departments high on-paper rents, but the departmental managers did not mind. They knew they were judged on how they grew their businesses, not on their occupancy costs.
But then, in the early 80's, Equitable's executives, like so many others, decided that lumping all of its New York employees together in one building, overseen by a few powerful executives who alone had incentives to ratchet profit up and costs down, was more stifling than efficient.
"A 6,800-person home office seemed much too bureaucratic," recalled William T. McCaffrey, Equitable's chief administrative officer. So the huge Equitable broke itself up into four profit centers and let each one decide where it wanted to live.
T HE real-estate group moved to Atlanta, which it felt was more central for its national business. The pension-operations group moved to Harmon Meadows in Secaucus, N.J., where rents were much lower. Some parts of the life insurance company moved to 135 West 50th Street, others to a modest building on Wall Street. Only Equitable Capital, the main investment arm, stayed on two floors at 1285.
The decentralization was not driven by real-estate concerns, but it could easily have been derailed by them.
"We might not have done it if our own experts had not told us that we could quickly rent the building," Mr. McCaffrey recalled.
The timing was excellent. The building had been well-maintained and modernized, rents were taking off across the city, and the Avenue of the Americas had become a prime address. Paine Webber became the anchor tenant, whose name went on the door, and others soon followed.
Equitable the insurer might have stopped there, but as the hefty rents started pouring in, Equitable the developer wanted more. Over the years, Equitable had been assembling the land west of 1285 to Seventh Avenue. So in 1985, fresh from leasing its first midtown skyscraper, Equitable proceeded to build its second.
But this time, Equitable's focus was on finding tenants, not housing itself. That meant worrying much more about negative perceptions of Seventh Avenue than it had 25 years before about those of Sixth.
"We figured the Equitable name and the building itself would overcome the address," Mr. Welch recalled.
Equitable physically linked 1285 and the new 787 Seventh Avenue, calling the resulting 3.3-million-square-foot combo Equitable Center. It moved some senior executives into the new tower and declared it Equitable world headquarters. It put in a health club, a branch of the Whitney Museum and a lobby dotted with Equitable-owned art, including a 68-foot-high Roy Lichtenstein mural and Thomas Hart Benton's 10-panel mural "America Today." It added fiberoptics, an auditorium and a broadcast studio that even nontenants rent. (Two examples: The mergers of I.B.M. and Lotus, and of Kimberly Clark and Scott Paper, were announced at Equitable Center.)
"When you view a building as an investment, you say, 'I'll get $42 a foot if I put down granite, but I can get $50 if I put down marble,' " Mr. McCaffrey said. "That's a different mindset than, 'What do my people need to be efficient.' "
Again, Equitable's timing was perfect. By the time the stock market crashed in October 1987, Equitable Center, despite charging premium rents, was fully leased. "We got in just under the gun," Mr. Welch said.
But Equitable's good timing as a developer could not immunize the big insurance company against the recession. Equitable, which "demutualized" and went public in 1992, downsized mightily in the 90's. By the end of 1992, it was down to 2,200 New York employees, rattling around in too much space in several buildings.
It had also grown disenchanted with decentralization. "We discovered how unproductive relying on cabs and trains could be," Mr. Welch said.
So, Equitable decided to consolidate. The question, though, was where?
"We canvassed Westchester, downtown Manhattan, we even looked in Albany," Mr. McCaffrey said. "But we simply wouldn't take the chance of losing more people by moving too far away." When a mass defection by the menswear industry opened more than 500,000 square feet of space at 1290, Equitable jumped at it.
Equitable will move into its space in stages, as its leases elsewhere expire. By 1999, Equitable's only presence in Equitable Center will be the 49th-floor meeting center and the 50th-floor board room, both of which, along with the broadcast studio and auditorium, it will use for itself and as a revenue producer. (The company took in $3.5 million from catering alone last year.)
The Willkie Farr & Gallagher law firm has rented most of the space Equitable occupied. Equitable is asking an annual rent of more than $50 a square foot for the almost four floors left. That is a hard target to hit even on Madison or Park, but Mr. Welch seems unconcerned. "I am convinced this space will rent," he said.
Equitable itself will be paying no such hefty rent. Indeed, starting next January, it expects to save some $30 million annually in occupancy costs over the next 16 years.
Of course, the savings have a price. Equitable's new home has all of the technological bells and whistles Equitable may want but little of the luxury. The employees who were at 787 Seventh had 480 square feet of space per person; in the new building, the average will be closer to 280 square feet.
But maybe, in the cost-conscious 90's, frugality is exactly the image that Equitable wants its new headquarters, which will bear its name, to project.
"Sure, image still matters," said Ms. Nelson of Edward S. Gordon. "But it is the image of efficiency and functionality, not flashiness, that counts today."

HEADLINE: Building Homes, and Skilled Developers, in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
AS a latecomer to redevelopment, the Saratoga Square urban renewal area in the Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville sections of Brooklyn still bears the signs of new housing construction waiting to happen. There are scattered vacant tracts in city ownership, many of them once occupied by abandoned housing.
But rehabilitation work has moved forward, and new construction is following. So far it has taken the form of 61 two-family houses (122 dwelling units) known as the Thomas S. Boyland Homes. They are in various stages of completion off Sumpter Street, Saratoga Avenue and Marion Street. 
 These are to be followed by 96 more two-families going into construction this year, and probably over a hundred a year or two after that. Within a few weeks, the first occupants will appear on Sumpter Street.
The obvious principal beneficiaries of this production are the buyers themselves, moderate-income people who are getting an unusually spacious two-family house for $128,000. That price, with a 5 percent down payment, is bringing in first-time home buyers to resettle a neighborhood with the thinned-out look of urban decline.
To Charles Samuels, a 53-year-old construction worker coming from a rental on Decatur Avenue, the neighborhood is "beautiful -- and very convenient." And to Patrician Huffstead, a Nynex employee living as a renter in Park Slope, "The neighborhood is fine. I have a friend living four blocks away and she has no complaints."
But the less obvious beneficiary of the development project is the developer himself, Carlton A. Brown. Its value to his business future underscores a subtle side effect of the citywide home-building program that the New York Housing Partnership has promoted with private and public assistance. It is bringing into being a new class of locally based, usually minority, builder-developers.
Mr. Brown is a 44-year-old resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant, who has lived on Hancock Street, 10 blocks from the development site, for the last 15 years. His late grandmother lived on Halsey Street nearby for 40 years. He himself grew up in Mississippi, the son of school teachers, and went to Princeton on a scholarship. He came to New York to work in the real estate development arm of A.T.&T.
He is a partner in a small company called Full Spectrum Building and Development, based in Harlem, with Walter Edwards, a longtime Harlem property owner, and Richard Durant, an engineer. Though Full Spectrum has contracting experience, it does not meet the conventional criteria for qualifying for bank financing for the $13.3 million Thomas Boyland homes.
Under the Partnership's Neighborhood Builder Program (originally the Minority Builder Program), established builders stand behind the newer builders, acting as mentors. The State of New York Mortgage Insurance Fund guarantees the construction financing provided by banks. Successful completion and sales, and the establishment of business relationships along the way, put the local entrepreneurs in position to borrow for future projects.
"It's a question of establishing a track record," said Mr. Brown, whose mentor in Bedford-Stuyvesant was Leslie Lerner, president of the Beechwood Corporation of Williston Park, L.I. Now Mr. Brown is already bidding for other work, including work outside the city -- a 200-unit affordable housing project in Boston and 110-unit development in Plainfield, N.J.
OTHER home builders before him have been launched by Housing Partnership projects. Among them are Gerson Nieves, president of the Nidus Corporation in the Bronx, which has evolved into a development company from a brokerage and property-management firm on Westchester Avenue. Mr. Nieves worked with DeLuxe Homes of Berwick, Pa., on Melrose Village, a development of 26 two-family houses in the Melrose section of the Bronx, and has since started two other projects for which he was able to get financing on his own. He will build 45 two- and three-family homes in Hunts Point and Crotona Park East.
Then there is Desmond Emanuel, an architect and engineer who is president of Santa Fe Construction in Manhattan. In 1990 he developed the Longwood Historic Homes in the Bronx, 50 newly constructed houses in the Longwood Historic District, with a long-time Staten Island developer, Randy Lee, as the mentor builder.
Since then, on his own, he has taken on development of 200 homes on a former sugar plantation in Antigua called Herbert's Estate. The firm expects to be in construction in May, with financial assistance from the Antiguan Government. Mr. Emanuel described it as a $30 million project that will be built in phases over three years.
"The program has given New York City its first cadre of minority owner-developers," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Housing Partnership. Eighteen small developers have completed projects, Ms. Wylde said, and six more have projects in planning and construction. The program was given its initial financial backing by Fred Wilpon, chairman of Sterling Equities, a large developer-owner. He is also chairman of the Housing Partnership, and co-owner of the New York Mets.
THE Thomas Boyland Homes are named for a late State Assemblyman from Bedford-Stuyvesant, who was the brother of the current Assemblyman, William F. Boyland. The house are attached, with red-brick face and brownstone-like design. Inside, there is 950 square feet of space per floor. In the owner's three-bedroom duplex, on the first and second levels, there is a walk-in closet in the bedroom and a whirpool tub in the bathroom. The third-floor rental apartment is expected to rent for $650 to $800 a month.
One unusual aspect of the construction is that it uses a product called engineered lumber for major structural members. Manufactured from a combination of laminated and compressed wood products by Georgia Pacific Corporation, it provides a stronger, nonsqueaking flooring system, Mr. Brown said. In recent years it has come closer in cost to conventional lumber, but there are large labor savings in installation.
"We used the money we saved to give larger houses and the whirlpool baths," Mr. Brown said.
Buyers have been getting mortgages through Fleet Mortgage of Westbury, L.I. Planning & Development Ventures, Inc., of Brooklyn, is overseeing the marketing, and the nonprofit Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corporation is doing the community outreach for buyers. The public subsidy -- $90,000 per two-family house -- has been supplement by discretionary funds from the budget of Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden.
New York State's contribution has been $15,000 per dwelling unit ($30,000 a house). But with the state looking to pare subsidies, future phases of development may accept buyers with incomes as high as 165 of median for the area -- or about $70,000, Ms. Wylde said. Reduced subsidies raise prices, and also make production riskier for developers, who might find it more difficult to get buyers.
Many of these buyers are coming from public housing, where their departure after years of residence is freeing apartments for occupancy by younger people with lower incomes. Among these buyers is Helen Frampton, a 38-year-old Nynex supervisor who has lived in the Housing Authority's Cypress Hill Houses in East New York for 15 years.
"I was afraid of the idea, but my friend owns two houses and she talked me into it," Ms. Frampton said. "She said it would be a good investment. My older sister and her kids will live in the bigger unit and I'll be in the rental unit. It will probably cost me less that I'm paying now in rent."
She is paying $128,000 for one of the Sumpter Street houses, she said. Her mother, who lives with her in Cypress Hill Houses, isn't reconciled to the idea of moving, however. "At the moment, she says she's staying," Ms. Frampton said.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a former Sarajevo bureau chief for United Press International, I must take issue with the review of Lord Owen's book. 
 There is no reason to excuse Lord Owen's failure to bring peace to Bosnia. His tenure as the European Union's special negotiator for the former Yugoslavia, and the plan he and Cyrus Vance drew up, were both fatally flawed. Time and again, Lord Owen carried the water of the Serbian and Bosnian Serb leaderships. He faithfully repeated and often endorsed their promises not to attack unarmed civilian populations, their promises to respect cease-fires and peace plans. Time and again, these promises were broken, and the slaughter went on. Time and again, Lord Owen assured the Western powers that next time it would be different.
Lord Owen's apparent interest in merely containing the war in Bosnia, not reaching a just or even a lasting peace, won him back his old London sobriquet, Dr. Death, in the streets of Sarajevo and among the Bosnia press corps.
Misha Glenny is certainly correct to say that the lack of resolve and the lack of interest on the part of both the United States and its European allies let the war continue. When the Clinton Administration finally did focus its attention on Bosnia and Croatia, the fighting was swiftly brought to a close.
But it is deceitful to suggest that the Vance-Owen plan could have stopped the war. The Vance-Owen plan was unworkable. It called for dividing Bosnia into 10 ethnic enclaves, many of which could not possibly have been defended or adequately policed by either the United Nations or a multinational force. And few of the enclaves would have been economically viable.
The hope was, and remains, that time and economic growth can heal the wounds of this war and that eventually -- in 10, 20 or 50 years -- Serbs, Croats and Muslims will find that trade brings them together again. This logic brought the French and Germans together in the European Coal and Steel Community after World War II. Today, French and German people whose fathers tried to kill one another in 1940 have buried the wartime enmity and even marry one another.
It was patently obvious to me and to many others on the ground during the war that such a peace could come to Bosnia only if all its people were helped to rebuild their homes in peace. Bosnia, it was clear, had to be provisionally divided into economically viable parts that could be effectively policed for several years by a well-armed international peacekeeping force.
Tens of thousands of corpses later, we at least have a plan that can effectively separate the two sides and allow Bosnia's people a chance to rebuild their lives. That's more than the Vance-Owen plan could ever have provided.
Lord Owen is by no means the greatest villain in the former Yugoslavia. But his major contribution to the war in Bosnia was to prolong the suffering of all peoples -- Serbs, Croats and Muslims -- by giving credence to the hollow promises of the warlords and murderers who found no profit in peace.

HEADLINE: Not Just Another Country

BYLINE: By James P. Pinkerton; James P. Pinkerton is a lecturer at the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University and the author of "What Comes Next: The End of Big Government -- and the New Paradigm."

 BODY:
To assert that America is exceptional, as analysts have been doing since Tocqueville, is to dwell on paradox. In "American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword," Seymour Martin Lipset motes that while the United States is the most litigious society in the world -- spending four to eight times as much on lawsuits as Germany, England, Italy, France, the Netherlands or Japan -- it is simultaneously one of the most lawless, vexed by crime rates triple those of other industialized nations. Hence America's double-edged sword: on one side of the blade, "a high sense of personal responsibility, independent initiative and voluntarism"; on the other side, "self-serving behavior, atomism and a disregard for communal good."
 Central to Mr. Lipset's American exceptionalism is the idea of a definable American Creed, "a set of dogmas about the nature of a good society," deriving mostly from the Revolution. These include liberty, egalitarianism (defined as equality of opportunity, not result), individualism, populism and laissez-faire. To buttress his argument, he uses copious survey data to demonstrate how different America is from other advanced countries. For example, in 1992 just 38 percent of Americans agreed that government should reduce the difference in income between rich and poor, compared with 65 percent of Britons, 66 percent of West Germans and 80 percent of Italians. 
 Pausing form cross-cultural explication, Mr. Lipset refreshes the reader with historical explanation. Whereas conservatism in the Old World, he writes, derived from "the historic alliance of church and government," in America it has adhered to the anti-stasist Whiggish tradition instead. Inheritors of Europe's feudal legacy, Tories like Disraeli and Bismarck established group-oriented programs for the poor, it spends more on education.
 This emphasis on individual opportunity makes racial preference programs automatically suspect to most Americans. Reaching back to 1871, Mr. Lipset cites the abolitionist Frederick Douglass as a fierce opponent of quotas; his narrative then leaps forward to the Nixon Administration, which implemented quotas over the opposition of civil rights leaders like Clarence Mitchell, a prominent official with the N.A.A.C.P., and Representative Augustus Hawkins. Of course, Republicans soon abandoned their policy offspring, which then took on a life of its own inside thejudiciary and bureaucracy and in the Democratic Party). "By a supreme irony," Mr. Lipset concludes, Richard Nixon, "the man most hated by the father of the affirmative action programs that have brought them so much ballot-box grief.
 If Mr. Lipset's strengthin this book is his ability to sift vast evidence and pluck out apt conclusions, his weakness is his seeming desire to get some matters off his chest (or off the hard drive of his computer) even if they don't fit hsi thesis. Three chapters, on African-Americans, Jews and intellectuals, seem to have wandered in from some other book; the author procrusteanizes them in this one with the declaration that they are the exceptions. Each of these groups has gone its own, sometimes surprising way. Blacks, Mr. Lipset argues, are faring better than most Americans realize: "The 'invisible man' of the 1990's is the successful black working- and middle-class suburbanite." Jews, combining affluence and liberalism, remain "unique in the American ethnic kaleidoscope"; in contrast to the national trend, Jewish support for Democratic candidates actually rose from 1992 to 1994. Intellectuals are also, Mr. Lipset asserts, "exceptions on the margin," although his quick chronicle, from Communism to McCarthyism to neoconservatism to political correctness, adds little insight into the ways of America's intellegentsia. Meanwhile, Mr. Lipset's own internal cliche-check has failed to catch such clunkers as "leaner and meaner" or "American as apple pie."
 The chapter on Japan also seems out of place, although it allows him toponder how two nations with "highly disparate value systems" can both be economically successful. He pithily summarizes Japan's economic awakening in the late 19th century as a "revolution from above," noting that new business and commercial values were inculcated into old warlords and warriors; yet even after a century of modernization, he adds, Japan's uniqueness -- Nihonron -- survives. Of course, this finding gives rise to the thesis-undercutting thought that perhaps all countries are exceptional in their own way.
 In his 22d book in a distinguished half-century career as a social scientist, with positions at Harvard, Stanford and now George Mason University, Mr. Lipset has chosen to concentrate before him: on the handful of nations with advanced social-science databases that can be analyzed in minute detail. Yet if the subject is America in a shrinking world on the eve of the 21st century, surely it's important also to compare America to the 175 or so developing nations, even if their survey-research infrastructure is sparse. That might be a good topic for Mr. Lipset's 23d book.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Deductible Charges In a Co-op

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
CO-OP shareholders across the country have received, or will shortly receive, notifications of how much of their total maintenance payments can be deducted from their Federal income tax returns. Some will find they can deduct as much as 70 percent. Others, however, will discover they can deduct as little as 20 percent.
Could it be that a building with a high percentage of deductible maintenance is better than one with a low percentage? 
 "It's not a question of one building's being better than another building," said Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives. "It's a reflection of the different services received by different shareholders in different buildings."
Still, many shareholders think of their maintenance fees the same way residential homeowners think of their mortgage payments -- as a tax-deductible, equity-building alternative to rent. Accordingly, the more deductible the mortgage payment, or maintenance payment, the better. Right?
"When you hear somebody say, 'My maintenance is 60 percent deductible,' " Mr. Weinstein said, "that sounds good because it reduces the net cost of paying maintenance." But, he said, as anyone who has borrowed money will readily understand, if given a choice between being able to deduct interest payments on loans or not having to take out the loans in the first place, most people would happily choose the latter. In other words, it costs money to borrow money; tax deductions only soften the blow.
People do borrow money, though. And since 1986, when Congress eliminated deductions for virtually all consumer debt except for residential financing, it has made increasing sense for homeowners who need to borrow money to borrow as much as possible with mortgages and home-equity loans and as little as possible with personal loans and credit cards.
In fact, for many homeowners it has become almost fashionable -- especially in these days of low interest rates -- to refinance their homes or take out home-equity loans to make as much of their debt as possible tax deductible.
But co-op shareholders do not have the same level of control over their tax-deductible debt as other property owners.
Walter D. Goldsmith, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-ops and condominiums, explained that co-op shareholders, like other property owners, are allowed tax deductions for real estate taxes and mortgage interest paid on their homes.
But since the co-op building itself is owned by the co-op corporation, the corporation pays real estate taxes and interest on the underlying mortgage on the building. The tax code, however, allows shareholders (who are essentially tenants) to deduct a portion of their maintenance charges (which is essentially rent paid to the co-op) from their taxable income.
And since each shareholder owns a specific percentage interest in the co-op as a whole, each shareholder's deduction is usually determined by the number of shares owned.
For example, in a 10-unit co-op with 10 shareholders who own 10 shares each, each shareholder would be allowed to deduct 10 percent of the real estate taxes and interest paid on the building's underlying mortgage. If real estate taxes and mortgage interest were the only expenses of the building, then the shareholders' maintenance charges would essentially be one hundred percent deductible.
In reality, however, there are always other expenses involved. And as those expenses increase the total cost of running the building, they decrease the proportion of the maintenance charges that are deductible.
For example, if the total additional expenses of running the building just happens to be the same amount as it costs to pay real estate taxes and interest payments, then the total expenses of the building are doubled. This doubles the maintenance payments, which cuts the deductible proportion of maintenance to 50 percent.
In the example above, although the maintenance charges doubled, the dollar amount of each shareholder's deduction remained the same. All things being equal, the situation is similar to a single-family homeowner's being able to deduct property taxes and mortgage interest, but not being able to deduct the cost of heat, electricity, custodial services, water and insurance.
"A building that has a full-service doorman, concierge and porters will probably have a lower percentage of deductibility than one without those services," said Mr. Weinstein. "That's because a greater percentage of the building's expenses goes to nondeductible expenses."
For all practical purposes, then, co-op shareholders get essentially the same treatment by the tax code as single-family homeowners. There are, however, some differences that result from the co-op form of ownership that can have tax consequences on shareholders.
For many single-family homeowners the tax deductions attributable to interest on mortgages are significantly greater than the deductions attributable to real property taxes. Moreover, single-family homeowners often have a significant measure of control over the amount of tax-deductible debt they incur.
But the situation is somewhat different for shareholders in co-ops.
"The biggest variable in a co-op is interest on the underlying mortgage," said Greg Young, director of sales and leasing for City Living, a Manhattan real estate brokerage. "And individual shareholders have no control over it. "
Indeed, opinion is divided on the question of whether it is more prudent to carry as much tax-deductible debt as possible or none at all.
"It's a raging argument in a lot of buildings," said Mr. Weinstein. "Some people argue that since interest is deductible and principal isn't, a building should not put itself in a position of repaying any of the principal on the underlying mortgage."
Others, he said, prefer to be as debt-free as possible, tax deductions notwithstanding.
The real point is that while the issue may be debated in a co-op, a single-family homeowner who wants to carry as much tax-deductible debt as possible could be filling out an application to refinance his or her mortgage.
Co-op shareholders are not entirely deprived of control over the total tax-deductible indebtedness they can incur.
For example, shareholders may legally deduct the interest on their share loans, the debt they incurred to purchase shares in the co-op. Moreover, like other property owners, shareholders can also take out equity loans on their shares as well.
And, if a co-op board is so inclined, or can be persuaded by shareholders, the co-op itself can take out additional tax-deductible debt for maintenance or repairs or even, perhaps, to beef up a reserve fund.
In the end, though, the value of a tax deduction depends largely on the taxpayer's income -- the more income, the more valuable the deduction.
But, said Mark Shernicoff, a Manhattan accountant, "tax deductions should not drive business decisions."

Retail Industry Gloom Fails to Deter Major Projects

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
DESPITE slumping sales, rising bankruptcy filings and consolidations by large store chains that are threatening to create substantial retail vacancies by the end of the year, developers are moving forward with major retail projects on Long Island.
These developers say rentals are brisk because national retailers continue to view Long Island as one of the nation's most lucrative markets. 
 "You have 2.3 million people with extremely strong demographics," said Steven B. Greenberg, president of the Greenberg Group, retail consultants in Hewlett. "There has been very little new development in the last three years, so although the retail business is difficult and we are seeing a host of bankruptcies, things are really not so bad."
The retail downturn has not affected all areas. With consumers always hungering for something new, home furnishings and electronics stores at Roosevelt Center are doing exceptionally well, said Edward J. Minskoff, a principal of MCS Realty Partners of Manhattan. MCS is developing the 2.6-million-square-foot mixed-use complex on the former Roosevelt Raceway site in Westbury.
The 600,000 square feet of retail space in the center, where construction started less than a year ago, is almost completed and is fully rented, said Mr. Minskoff. Retailers include such newcomers to Long Island as Incredible Universe, an electronics store, and the Home Depot Expo Design Center. A Babies 'R' Us store, another newcomer to Long Island, will open in March.
Nearby on Old Country Road in Westbury, two-thirds of the 522,000 square feet of new rentable space on a 38-acre site now occupied by Fortunoff has been preleased -- even though it is not yet under construction, said Alan Fortunoff, Fortunoff's president. He is developing the site as a 930,000-square-foot mall called the Source in a joint venture with the Simon Property Group of Indianapolis.
"This is a terrific time for the kind of mall we are building because we are bringing a lot of retailers to Long Island that are not here now," Mr. Fortunoff said.
The anchor stores at the Source will include a 45,000-square-foot Nordstrom Rack and a 35,000-square-foot Off 5th, Saks Fifth Avenue Outlet, which are outlet stores for the two retailers. Others are Virgin Megastore, a record and video store that will occupy 25,000 square feet, and Just For Feet, a shoe store that has taken 19,000 square feet. Old Navy Clothing Company, a division of Gap; the Cheesecake Factory, a restaurant, and Innovation Luggage are among other retailers who will be in the development.
Ground was broken for the $145 million complex on Feb. 1. The mall will include the 32-year-old existing 212,000-square-foot Fortunoff store when it is completed in August 1997.
At the Roosevelt Field Shopping Center in Garden City almost 400,000 square feet of space is being added to the mall's existing 2 million square feet.
N ORDSTROM, a department store chain based in Seattle, is building a 225,000-square-foot store on the east side of the mall on land it has leased from Corporate Property Investors of Manhattan, the mall owners. The new store, Nordstrom's first on Long Island, will open in the fall of 1997.
Corporate Property Investors itself is completing a 168,000-square-foot second-story addition to the the mall. The new space, to be ready for occupancy this fall, will be divided into 50 stores. About 80 percent of that space has already been leased, said Michael J. Maloney, the company's senior vice president.
"Retail sales were difficult last year and Roosevelt Field has to reflect what's happening in retailing in general," Mr. Maloney said. "However, with such a huge depository of stores, people may not be spending as much as they did in years past. But they are still spending a tremendous amount."
Corporate Property Investors also is moving ahead with plans to renovate and expand its 950,000-square-foot Walt Whitman Mall on Route 110 in Melville and add 330,000 square feet of space. New tenants will include a two-story Saks Fifth Avenue, which will move into 120,000 square feet of new space, and Bloomingdale's, which will occupy 220,000 square feet of the existing mall.
An additional 210,000 square feet of new construction on a second level will be divided into 100 smaller stores. About $250 million is being spent on the mall project, including work being done by the individual department stores.
"Malls are expanding because they look at the long term," said Rick Kreindler, chairman of Island Realty, commercial brokers in Melville.
"What's coming down the road should be positive and whoever presents space in the most attractive way is going to get the business."
New locations are also under development. Wilbur J. Breslin, a Garden City developer, said he expected to start construction of the 790,000-square-foot first phase of a 1.6 million square-foot mall in Yaphank this spring.
He is also at work on a 385,000-square-foot mall in Hempstead, which will replace an Abraham & Straus store on the site that closed in 1992.
In Yaphank, Mr. Breslin said, 500,000 square feet has been leased to three department store tenants, none of which he would name, and 50 smaller stores. The Hempstead space has been fully leased, he said, with the exception of 105,000 square feet that was to have been occupied by Bradlees, a department store chain that has filed for bankruptcy.
Bradlees and Caldor, another department store that filed for bankruptcy last year, are victims of "expanding too quickly, paying very high rents, and facing lots of very severe competition," said Stanley H. Schuckman, president of Schuckman Realty, commercial brokers in Woodbury. The two stores have a total of 17 locations on Long Island, and had been looking for additional locations.
But brokers say that potential vacancies being created by bankruptcies can also be seen in a positive light.
"You see retailers failing and you wonder who's going to replace them, and here comes another wave eager to get into the market because of the excellent demographics," said John Thomas, managing director of Select Investment Realty Advisors in Ronkonkoma.
S TILL, there is a lot more caution in the air, said Arthur D. Sanders, president of Spiegel Associates of Hicksville, owners and developers of retail space. Mr. Sanders said he was working with several large tenants who want to sign short-term leases "while they test the water."
Yet, one newcomer has been so aggressive about entering the Long Island market that it purchased an existing company.
The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company of Quincy, Mass., which has one store under construction in East Setauket and others pending in Roslyn and East Islip, acquired the MelMarkets chain of 17 Foodtown supermarkets on Long Island in December in a transaction valued at $85 million. Stop & Shop focuses on providing a very large selection of foods along with general merchandise such as books, prescription drugs and flowers.
Overall, brokers say, retailers that have something new and exciting to offer will continue to prosper even in this economy.
"The ones that can come up with a niche and provide better service and good selection and good quality will do well," said Lawrence Holzman of Lawrence Holzman Inc., a retail leasing consultant in Manhattan.
Mr. Holzman represents a rapidly growing supermarket chain called Advantage Stores, which is based in Farmingdale.
Advantage, which describes itself as a hybrid between a traditional supermarket and a warehouse club, opened two stores last year, has a third scheduled to open next Saturday in Bethpage, and expects to have as many as 10 stores open by the end of the year.
The concept, a new one, is to offer a smaller selection of merchandise in a smaller environment, with no membership fee, but at similar discounts offered by warehouse clubs.
"We are going from zero in revenues in 1994, to $6 million in 1995 and expect to go to $22 million this year," said Brian Robinson, the company's founder and chief executive officer.

Fair Lawn and Clifton Upgrading Lagging Corridors

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
TIME has not been a friend to neighborhood commercial corridors. Once places where residents flocked to do business, they have been drained of some of their luster and prosperity as malls and strip centers siphoned away patrons. A roller-coaster economy over the last decade has also taken a toll.
But rather than continue at the mercy of such forces, a few communities are pursuing revitalization programs for their lagging corridors, just as has been and is being done for downtowns. Such corridors generally comprise a jumble of businesses -- from individual shops and retail strips to professional offices and even industry -- stretching for blocks and lining a main thoroughfare in the community. 
 Campaigns are under way on River Road in Fair Lawn in Bergen County and on Main Avenue in Clifton in Passaic County to give the old streets a new image more in tune with the 1990's and promote more commerce.
At least from a retail perspective, that may not be easy. "Though traffic at malls is decreasing, these corridors, like downtowns, have an uphill battle to attract customers," said Kurt Barnard, a retail analyst based in Scotch Plains. "They have to offer something other than just stores." Even that will only slow -- not halt -- the decline, he said.
Still, officials in Clifton and Fair Lawn say the efforts will help maintain the tax base in their communities and make them more attractive places in which to live, work and shop. Each, however, is taking a different approach.
In Fair Lawn, business leaders with the borough and county as partners last April began an $8 million, three-year campaign for River Road, the oldest of five commercial corridors in the community. The project also includes two blocks of Fair Lawn Avenue. Financing is coming from public and private sources, including $300,000 from a group of businesses to cover operating costs for the nonprofit River Road Improvement Corporation, which oversees the program. .
"The key is the private sector's involvement," said Donald R. Smartt, president of Downtown Managers, a consulting firm in Verona, who is working on the River Road program. "There's never enough public funds for such efforts, and it insures the program can survive changes in local leadership." He said that forming a Special Improvement District would be considered after three years. A 1984 state law lets communities set up such districts, in which property owners tax themselves to finance improvements as well as services, including marketing to spur business.
River Road runs for a mile and a half through Fair Lawn's western section past houses, offices, shops, service businesses, a retail strip and some manufacturing plants and labs. The 150 businesses that fill its midsection, many in former homes, comprise a weary hodgepodge, worsened by poor lighting and road conditions, according to a report by the River Road Improvement Corporation.
Mayor Joseph Tedeschi is betting that, with a new look involving "better access, and more services, specialty retailers and restaurants," River Road can become more viable. Robert W. Landzettel, chairman of the improvement corporation, agreed. "The results will not pop up overnight, but this program provides the framework to move into the future," said Mr. Landzettel, whose family has run Lazon Paints on River Road for 34 years.
Among the $1.75 million in physical upgrades planned are the creation of two more parking lots and the improvement of three intersections along River Road, with work on the first intersection at Fair Lawn Avenue to start this spring.
Business owners are also being encouraged to spruce up their properties with the help of low-interest loans offered through four neighborhood banks. Each has committed to lend $500,000 annually for the next three years in seven-year loans of $5,000 to $50,000 at one point below the prime rate. The loans can be used to improve store facades and interiors.
The approval process has also been expedited and the borough is revising its zoning ordinance. Some revisions will raise building heights along the street to three stories from two and permit office and residential use above stores. And following the improvement corporation's "streetscape master plan," property owners are encouraged to put in new signage and more landscaping.
O NE example is the $10 million expansion planned for the 25,000-square-foot Shop Rite that anchors an 85,000-square-foot shopping center on the corridor. The old supermarket will be razed and replaced by a 55,000 square foot store.
"We worked with the corporation on the streetscape plan and will implement it at our site," said Todd Koenig of Saphire Associates in Princeton, the Shop Rite project's architect. Among other things, 35 trees will go up in front of the new store, to be clad in beige concrete block, and shepherd-crook street lights will line the entrance. Mr. Koenig said construction would start by June and finish by year-end.
"We have set a higher standard for the street," said Mr. Smartt, the consultant, "and now we are giving property owners the incentives to follow it."
Mayor Tedeschi said that if the program worked well on River Road, it might be tried on the borough's Broadway corridor.
As part of a Clifton's improvement program, the city has so far committed more than $500,000 in Federal grants to renovating 6 of the 25 blocks that comprise its Main Avenue business corridor, one of several in the community.
The initial focus is on physical improvements, including new brick-paved sidewalks, planters and street lights, said Stephen Lopez, who runs a planning and landscape architecture firm in Pleasantville in Westchester County and is a consultant to the city on the improvement program. The work is to be completed by this fall and will then continue along Main Avenue.
At the same time, proposals are before the City Council to add more parking, form a special improvement district and create an "overlay zone" that will set design standards for among other things building facades and signs. The latter is intended "to bring continuity to the avenue's appearance," added Mr. Lopez, who is also Commissioner of Planning for the Town of Greenburgh where a similar strategy improved that community's portion of Central Park Avenue, a main commercial thoroughfare in Westchester County
The property on the six blocks of Clifton's Main Avenue, made up of 40 mostly retail businesses, is a mishmash, Mr. Lopez said. With low-interest loans from the city in cooperation with local banks, property owners will be encouraged to improve the appearance of their buildings using the new standards as well as add more landscaping.
"The area needs an extra shot in the arm, and this program gives me some optimism for the future," said Paul Epstein, whose family has operated Epstein's at Clifton, a women's clothing store on the avenue since 1945.
One encouraging sign is the transformation of a dormant auto dealership into a tire-supply store. Although the tire store, while on Main Avenue, is outside the six-block target area, its transformation at a cost of more than $1 million "is a plus to the avenue and an incentive" for property owners to follow suit, said Donna M. Sidoti, the city's program monitor for community development. "If we do nothing," she added, "the avenue could decline beyond repair."

The Airwaves as a Toll Road

BYLINE: By ELI M. NOAM; Eli M. Noam is a professor of finance and economics at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business and director of its Institute for Tele-Information. He was a member of the New York State Public Service Commission from 1987 to 1990.

 BODY:
WHEN President Clinton signed the telecommunications act into law on Thursday, one of the major unresolved issues was whether television broadcasters should pay for their licenses for next-generation digital TV. Senator Bob Dole insists that they should. And the most-discussed way would be through an auction in which they would bid, just like mobile phone operators, for the spectrum they plan to use. 
 Broadcasters are appalled, divining political motives. They successfully fought similar suggestions for decades, but their problem now is that it seems almost everyone loves a spectrum auction: liberals, because it makes companies pay their way; conservatives, because it substitutes market mechanisms for government controls; economists, because it allocates the spectrum quickly and efficiently, and budget balancers, because it raises much money.
Those who oppose auctions are either existing broadcasters arguing on behalf of traditional "free" and new digital TV, or public-interest advocates who regard the spectrum as a public sphere subject to public-service obligations.
It seems fair and efficient to charge for a scarce resource. That makes auctions a useful tool for now, especially if they are linked to flexible usage that encourages competition, such as letting a cellular phone company also use its access for broadcasting. But there is a better free-market option, one that can preserve flexibility for the future: an open-entry spectrum system.
The current auction system compares the spectrum to land. But that is based on today's relatively primitive state of technology in which information is basically coded onto a single frequency to prevent interference with other users. For similar reasons, most bands are dedicated to a single purpose, like mobile phones or radio. It is as if a highway were divided into wide lanes for each type of usage -- trucking, busing, touring -- and then into narrow lanes, one for each transportation company. One can then debate how to distribute the lanes, whether, for instance, by economics, politics, luck, priority or ethnic diversity.
But why not instead mingle the traffic of users, and if the highway begins to fill up, charge a toll to every user? And make that toll depend on traffic conditions, so it is higher at rush hour than at midnight? In such a system, a user does not buy part of the highway, but instead pays for access to the road. On certain frequency bands that would be dedicated to this system, nobody would control any particular frequency and anybody could enter at any time, without need for a license.
All spectrum users in this system would be subject to an access fee, or toll, that would be continuously and automatically determined by the supply-and-demand conditions at the time. They would transmit not on one frequency, but anywhere on a wide band; in New York, for instance, CBS would not come in on the frequency now commonly known as Channel 2, but would enter anywhere along the TV or other bands, with one or multiple programs. With new "smart" technology, TV sets would then select the broadcaster or program that the viewer had chosen from a menu on the screen. Or the viewer might choose to hear music or visit the Internet, and the smart TV would pick those off the band.
THIS is not farfetched. Evolving technology can squeeze much more information into a spectrum band by having the bits of information seek temporarily unoccupied frequencies and time slots rather than stick to one dedicated frequency. And economics, through variations in the access price, can allocate the scarce spectrum most efficiently.
How would the price be set? Users of spectrum bands would run clearinghouses that would function like commodity exchanges, but for spectrum rights instead of orange juice or pork bellies. In practical terms, a clearinghouse would be a computer that sends out price signals; users who accept the price would respond with a return signal. When capacity is underutilized, prices drop and an updated signal is sent.
This system need not be applied to every band. For example, some frequencies could be dedicated to educational or governmental users, which could also resell parts of their capacity to raise operating revenue. Similarly, election candidates could get a "bit endowment" to gain access to the spectrum.
Some auction enthusiasts believe that establishing firm property rights in the spectrum would mean the end of government regulation. But that is naive. Such rights, by themselves, would not end government intrusion any more than private ownership of land stops government from regulating it in detail. Indeed, an auction could lead to regulation if the highest bids are made by companies seeking oligopolistic pricing. To maintain competitive markets, it is thus important to create the possibility of continuous entry by other companies because high prices would then not be sustainable.
Who gets the proceeds from the access charges? As in auctions, it would be the United States Treasury, but with the revenue flow smoothed, rather than dependent on one-time sales. Proceeds now disappear into the black hole of the budget, taking money out of the telecommunications infrastructure when there is a need to upgrade it. This suggests the need for some funds to be designated for reinvestment in communications.
The concept of pay-as-you-go spectrum access, rather than exclusive licenses, is unfamiliar. But it is no different from the situation of an independent gas station that cannot be certain of the price of wholesale gasoline, but buys it at market prices. Where certainty of price is essential, markets for capacity futures will no doubt evolve just as they did for crude oil.
Is the concept practical? In the 1950's, when a law student, Leo Herzel, and the future Nobel laureate Ronald H. Coase proposed spectrum auctions, they were met with a host of spurious objections based on their impracticality. Technologically, this next-generation system is not now available, but its components either exist or are in reach.
The point is that spectrum allocation can take new forms. This suggests that Congress, instead of legislating this matter in detail now, should delegate authority to its expert agency, the Federal Communications Commission, to devise appropriate systems of fees. And it suggests that the F.C.C., whose auctions have been a success story, should not sit on its laurels but should approach free-market spectrum allocation in a pragmatic and searching fashion. We should be ready to bring the invisible hand fully to the invisible resource.

Luxury Club's Demise Was Sudden but Slow

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
When the Atrium Club opened in 1975 on a swank block of 57th Street near Park Avenue, Gerald R. Ford was President and the idea of a luxurious social club with a top-flight gymnasium and a dining room was the buzz of chic Manhattan. But when it closed abruptly on Feb. 1, perhaps the most surprising thing about the Atrium Club was that its death took so long -- and that it came without notice.
Dozens of club members and employees came in from a cold winter morning to find the elevators to the eighth-floor club barred by security guards. The only explanation was a three-paragraph "Dear Member" letter taped to the marble walls that read, in part, "Unfortunately, the economic realities of the Atrium Cub do not permit the continued operation of the club on a free-standing basis." 
 All the stock of Atrium Club Inc. is owned by the Dallas-based Club Corporation of America, one of the world's largest health, fitness and golf club operators. James Maser, vice president of Atrium Club, described Club Corporation's role as a "consultant."
Mr. Maser blamed the demise of the club, with initiation fees of up to $1,000, plus $110 or more in monthly dues, on changing tax laws and increasing competition from "super gyms" like Reebok and Equinox on the Upper West Side.
"It closed because the economics of the business would not allow it to continue," he said. He pointed especially to changes in Federal tax laws -- reducing the deduction for business meals to 50 percent from 100 percent and eliminating the deduction for club dues -- that, he said, meant a steady decline in the number of members using the club to entertain clients.
But several members and employees blamed the closing on years of poor management. "All the members I knew left when it was clear the club was being managed very poorly," Joseph F. Blumenthal, a member for 12 years, said. "It was always treated as a black sheep in a very large family."
Services in general, he said, did not merit the club's steep membership costs. For example, deteriorating shower stalls were not retiled, and management dragged its heels in buying new equipment like the Gravitron weight machine.
Behind in the monthly rent, which they declined to disclose, the Atrium Club's management has been trying to sell the operation since November. Gerald H. Morganstern, a lawyer for the building's landlord, Laszlo Tauber & Associates, said negotiations are under way with the New York Health and Racquet Club.
But what will happen to the 1,500 members and 55 gym instructors, kitchen staff and maintenance workers is uncertain. A spokesman for the New York Health and Racquet Club declined to comment. ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: Lower Taxes, Higher Revenues

BYLINE: By Jack Kemp; Jack Kemp, co-director of Empower America, was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Bush Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low, and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut taxes now." These Reaganesque words came straight from the lips of President John F. Kennedy in 1962, and they ring as true today as they did then.
Why, then, do so many politicans from both parties offer only spending reductions as means to balance the budget? No doubt a balanced budget is an important goal, and we'll have to cut wasteful Federal spending to get there. But surely none of the Republican candidates really believes that we can erase the deficit and reduce the Federal debt solely by tightening our collective budget belt. We need tax reform too. 
 Part of the problem is that for years the liberal establishment has been insisting that the Reagan Revolution increased the deficit dramatically. It seems that many in Congress and several Republican candidates are beginning to believe it. The result is a barrage of attacks on pro-growth tax proposals, based on the mistaken charge that cutting taxes would cause the deficit to explode. A history lesson is in order.
Three times in this century the United States has significantly reduced the top marginal income tax rates. In the 1920's the top rate was lowered from 73 percent to 25 percent. Between 1921 to 1928, tax revenues rose from $719 million to $1.16 billion, an increase of over 60 percent. President Kennedy's tax cuts between 1963 and 1965 lowered the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. Over that period, revenues increased more than 16 percent.
In the 1980's, taxes were lowered from a top marginal rate of 70 percent to 28 percent. By the end of the decade, America's real gross domestic product surged by 32 percent and revenues grew by nearly 40 percent. True, nominal budget deficits were higher at the end of the Reagan era. But as a percentage of the gross domestic product, the deficit actually diminished during the 1980's.
That is why today all efforts to expand the economy by lowering the tax burden on work, savings, investment and entrepreneurship -- including flat-tax plans of Steve Forbes and Representative Dick Armey -- deserve to be discussed and debated, without anyone invoking class warfare.
The National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, which I chaired for House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, found that a radical overhaul of the tax code would be vital to our goal of doubling the rate of economic growth. We recommended a simple plan that would tax income only once at a flat rate no higher than 19 percent and would allow working men and women to deduct their payroll taxes. (I would go further and exempt charitable donations and home mortgage interest.)
While we debate such radical reforms, we should quickly reduce the capital gains tax and index it to eliminate the effects of inflation -- a key to ending the budget stalemate.
Critics of a capital gains tax cut claim that doing so would be a payoff to the rich and would cause revenues to fall, thereby increasing the deficit. This is not true. Cutting and indexing capital gains tax rates would help low-income and high-risk entrepreneurial ventures get investors, fostering a more vibrant national economy and thereby expanding the tax base. The capital gains tax is less of a tax on the rich than it is a barrier to the success of lower-income people willing to take a risk.
Cutting taxes is the key to doubling the rate of economic growth, and would do more for America than just help balance the Federal budget. None of the myriad challenges confronting our nation -- poverty, crime, racial tension and welfare dependence -- can be solved without economic expansion.

HEADLINE: After a Dismal '95, Small Markets Surge

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
SOME of the world's smallest markets have come roaring back this year. Leading the charge have been Latin American stocks, though their brethren in Southeast Asia have also contributed to the impressive gains racked up by emerging-markets funds.
Talk about a turnaround. After a dismal performance last year, funds investing south of the border rose nearly 14 percent in January, far surpassing the gains of United States stock funds. 
 The surge in Latin American markets poses a question for investors: Have you already missed the boat this year? Managers of mutual funds invested in the region are quick to reassure, saying Latin America has plenty of room left to run.
With the exception of Chile, though, "Latin America is not a high-growth story," said Robert L. Meyer, who manages more than $1 billion in Latin American equities for Morgan Stanley, including the Morgan Stanley Latin American Fund, which rose 18.1 percent last month. "It's more like a reformed alcoholic. The region has kicked the habit of the fiscal and economic excesses of the 80's."
As a result, there will be setbacks as well as advances, and both will tend to be sharp like the one in January, Mr. Meyer said.
Behind the recent stock surge is a region on the rebound. Latin American markets fell 20.5 percent in 1995 after plunging 15 percent in 1994.
Contributing to last year's decline was selling by Americans who wanted to use their Latin American losses to offset domestic gains. Short-selling by skeptics didn't help either.
By the end of last year, investors acutely aware of the high stock prices in the United States were scouring the world for a region with greater potential in the new year. After a miserable showing in 1995, emerging markets captured much attention, with a particular emphasis on Latin America.
Money started flooding into the region early this year, chasing a limited number of shares. Prices rose as demand began to exceed supply. "It doesn't take much in less liquid markets to be pushed very hard," Mark J. Edwards, co-manager of the T. Rowe Price Latin America fund, said in a telephone interview from London.
The turnabout by investors was based in large part on the strengthening of the Mexican economy. The currency devaluation in December 1994 was handled badly by the Mexicans, Mr. Meyer and others conceded, but other policies have had more success. (For one, the country has a balanced budget.) While the banking sector remains dicey, fears of a general economic collapse have been averted. The country seems to be back on track after stabilizing its currency.
All the region's larger markets -- Argentina, Brazil and Mexico -- are making the transition from recession to growth, said Maria-Elena Carrion, co-manager of the BT Investment Latin American Equity fund. As a result, "earnings comparisons will be much better in the second half of 1996, whereas earnings growth rates will be slowing down in the U.S. and Europe," she said.
Mexico looks pretty good over the next 12 to 36 months, said Peter M. Donovan, who runs the Wright Equifund Mexico, the only fund to invest solely in that country. "Certainly there's more room for the authorities to cut interest rates," he said, "and that should help stock prices."
Mr. Meyer of Morgan Stanley kept his fund fully invested during the region's dark days and is pouring new money into existing holdings. In Mexico, which accounts for about a third of his portfolio, he focuses on blue-chip companies, including two banks, Banacci and Bancomer, each with about 20 percent market share; Cemex, a cement company, and Femsa, one of two companies that control the beer industry.
In Brazil, Mr. Meyer owns shares in the state-owned telecommunications, utilities and oil companies, which he expects to be privatized after spurts in profitability. Telebras's earnings should double by year-end, and it was just listed on the New York Stock Exchange. He also owns shares in Electrobras and Petrobras, electric and oil companies.
Electrobras is also a favorite of Mr. Edwards of T. Rowe Price. His fund tends to focus on blue-chip companies with steady growth.In Mexico, these include Cifra, a retailer, and Televisa, the media giant.
The BT and Hercules Latin America Value funds, co-managed by Ms. Carrion, focus on two major themes in the markets of Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. First are sectors that are sensitive to falling interest rates, like banking, real estate and construction. Next are cyclical stocks like consumer durables and auto parts.
Ed Games, who manages more than $600 million in the Scudder Latin America fund, favors the soft-drink industry, and owns Pan American Beverages, the biggest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America.
What's the best way to play Latin America? Most of the 14 funds investing in the region came along in 1994, the year after the Latin America group gained 57.1 percent, on average. Many others are very small.
Scudder Latin America, which started in late 1992, is the granddaddy of the group. It is also the favorite of Kim Rebecca, a Morningstar analyst. She says the fund has the "most consistent level of performance and risk management."
The funds can vary widely in their investment practices. While Morgan Stanley stays fully invested, no matter the market conditions, the Scudder fund has pushed its cash holdings as high as 17 percent of assets when prices seemed high.
"When we see a great deal of euphoria," Mr. Games said, "we increase cash so we have money on hand to meet redemptions or buy stocks," after the bubble bursts.
So just how nervous is he after that sizzling January? Enough to have stashed 9 percent of the fund in cash.

HEADLINE: The Sun Shines Again In Brazil and Argentina

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
THE stock markets of Argentina and Brazil staged startling comebacks in the first month of 1996, and they have now recovered all the losses suffered after stocks were dragged down by Mexico's financial crisis.
In Buenos Aires, where the Merval index has risen 5.7 percent since Jan. 1, the rally is being fueled by local investors, mainly large retirement funds that have acquired new capital, and renewed faith at home and abroad that Argentina will not devalue its currency as Mexico did so fatefully in December 1994. 
 In Sao Paulo, Brazil, where the Bovespa index is up 22.1 percent since New Year's, the boom is being driven by foreign bargain hunters and growing optimism over Brazil's prospects for growth and lower interest rates this year.
After erratic trading, heavy losses, capital flight and overall uncertainty in 1995, the sharp rise in Argentine and Brazilian stocks demonstrates new confidence in these two emerging markets. Stockbrokers and market analysts said they expected the rallies to continue, especially after the recent drop in United States interest rates.
"The January rally was not a fluke, and I expect it to continue this year because investors are convinced of Argentina's stability and potential for growth," said Christopher Eccelstone, an analyst for Interacciones Research, based in Buenos Aires. "I only see the market going up from here, perhaps with a few minor glitches along the way."
A big contributor to the bull market seen by Mr. Eccelstone would be Argentina's retirement funds, which are looking to increase yields by investing in equities.
Mr. Eccelstone predicted that Argentine retirement funds, which now have about 6 percent of their $2.49 billion in assets invested in the stock market, could raise their equity position to 25 percent over the next two years.
But Argentina, still struggling to overcome a deep recession brought on by the Mexico currency crisis, desperately needs foreign investment to finance growth in its stock market and economy and to meet its debt payments. The recession wiped away Argentina's growth last year and led to record levels of unemployment.
Many economists and analysts said foreign investors were again interested in Argentina, especially because the country had made good on its promise not to devalue its currency and to maintain its convertibility plan, which pegs the Argentine peso one-to-one with the dollar.
Foreign investors have also been encouraged by a recent agreement between President Carlos Saul Menem and Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo to stop the public bickering that has raised uncertainty over the continuation of policy changes that have brought growth and stability to the economy.
"The key is foreign investors in Argentina," said Luis Corsiglia, a well-known broker here. "We need an inflow of capital from abroad, and we are starting to see a return of many foreigners who were scared away last year."
Mr. Corsiglia, like many other brokers and economists, is predicting 3 to 5 percent economic growth for Argentina this year. He also expects the Merval index to reach 700 this year, for a one-year gain of nearly 35 percent.
STOCKBROKERS are recommending Argentine stocks in the banking and utility sectors, including Banco Frances, Banco de Galicia, Telefonica, Telecom Argentina and the oil company YPF. But brokers said the performance of Argentina's stock market would depend heavily on the ability of the Government to control costs and to institute the next round of economic policy changes in the banking, health care, labor and judicial systems and in the provincial governments.
In Brazil, meanwhile, foreign investors hungry for bargains poured into its stock market during January and the appetite is expected to continue. These investors are showing keen interest in Brazilian private-sector stocks in areas like steel, banking, paper and pulp, and consumer durables. Those areas will probably benefit most from expected growth in the economy and a reduction in interest rates.
"Foreign investors are coming into Brazil because there's a general feeling that some parts of the market are cheap and attractively priced, especially the private sector," said Jay Pelosky Jr., director of research and strategy for Morgan Stanley Latin America. "There is also a sense that the economy is likely to pick up in 1996 and that interest rates will come down dramatically."
Morgan Stanley is advising its clients to maintain a 60-40 split between private- and public-sector stocks in Brazil. State enterprises like the oil company Petrobras, the electricity utility Electrobras and the phone company Telebras were the best performers last year.
"Capital is coming back into the markets and although there may be some bad political news that leads to selling pressure, it will be minimal," Mr. Pelosky said. "Some people still have a bear-market psychology, but we recommend that people get in and stay in."
Wayne Perkins, director of research for Banco Norchem F.A., Chemical Bank's investment banking affiliate in Brazil, said his strategy was to look for stocks that might not have stunning results in the short term but whose prices were so low as to discount potential problems.
"For those who have a strong stomach for volatility and an appetite for strong returns, Brazil is a good place to invest," Mr. Perkins said. "I believe this is the best macroeconomic political situation for Brazil in the last 30 to 40 years."

HEADLINE: Saudi Arabia Economy Is Looking Better

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"An Inconvenient Saudi Dissident" (editorial, Feb. 5) says that the Saudi Arabian Government's fiscal situation has deteriorated in recent years. 
 The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait necessitated the payment by Saudi Arabia of more than $55 billion in cash for direct war-related expenses, which represented one-half of the country's gross domestic product at that time and slowed achievement of the kingdom's economic goals.
Saudi Arabia has largely recovered.
Budgets were cut by 20 percent in 1994 and 6 percent in 1995, subsidies have been reduced, and the fiscal picture is improving, not deteriorating.
This success derives from cultivation of a strong private sector; an open economy that attracts the participation of foreign companies, and investment of nearly $1 trillion in infrastructure in less than three decades.
Gross domestic product growth at an estimated 4.3 percent for 1995 and repayment of the Government's international debt during that year provide evidence of the improved outlook.

HEADLINE: At the Apollo, Past Meets Future

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
GRACE BLAKE has a dream mission. Or is it a nearly impossibl' task?
Ms. Blake, the new executive director of the Apollo Theater Foundation, envisions turning the landmark Apollo Theater in the heart of Harlem into a world-class cultural magnet: a place to expose young African-Americans to the arts and to honor legendary entertainers like Billie Holiday and Count Basie who graced the stage on 125th Street. 
 "I came here and realized we have a gold mine," said Ms. Blake, who brings to her seven-month-old job 25 years of experience in the film industry. "For whatever reason, it's not been tapped."
To begin that process, the theater has signed Patti LaBelle for an appearance later this month and B. B. King, Bobby Blue Bland and Ruth Brown for a joint appearance next month that Ms. Blake hopes will attract a wide cross section of people.
"It really and truly is a dream mission," Ms. Blake said, when asked about the daunting prospect of raising money for a theater in a struggling neighborhood in a time of economic retrenchment. "I visualize what can happen with this place. I don't see the odds against it. It's a big challenge, but the challenge is the excitement."
The Apollo is one of the icons of Harlem and of New York City, with a rich history that reflects the permutations of American race relations. But it has lost millions of dollars since the late 1970's and still struggles to survive. The Apollo's decline in fortunes has been linked to that of Harlem, and community leaders see the theater's rebirth as integral to the community's growth.
"Grace has an arduous task," said Warren S. Whitlock, the deputy executive director of the Harlem Community Development Corporation. "They need to create more artistic venues there. It's critical to get more stars -- but big stars want to go to Madison Square Garden, the Meadowlands.
"It's very critical this community understand we have a famous landmark institute we need to support, and I'm sure the community will." '
The four-story building, which was erected in 1913, closed in 1978 because its owners -- the family of Frank Schiffman, a former schoolteacher -- said they felt they were losing too much money. The Apollo did not reopen until 1983. But it began to lose so much money again that by 1991, Percy E. Sutton, the entrepreneur and former Manhattan Borough President, who had bought it with a group of investors at a bankruptcy sale, was ready to give it up. By then, Mr. Sutton had presided over a $20 million renovation that his group hoped would make the Apollo the center of a revitalized West 125th Street, Harlem's main commercial strip. The money went into creating an entertainment complex with a recording studio and television production center; but they were seldom used. In 1992, the investors transferred ownership to the Apollo Theater Foundation.
The nonprofit foundation was created with a mandate that included establishing a permanent public museum within the theater and a hall of fame, and to offer benefit performances and fund-raisers that would go into the construction and maintenance of the hall.
The first inductees will include Nat (King) Cole, Moms Mabley, Duke Ellington and Bill (Bojangles) Robinson. Construction of the hall is expected to cost $500,000.
The theater has not been able to draw, on a regular basis, the big-name stars that made it famous. Yet, more than 17,000 tourists and patrons come to the theater each month, and the legendary Wednesday amateur night competition continues to be popular. The 12-member staff coordinates about 12 events a month.
The glory days began in 1934, when the Apollo opened a "colored revue." In the following years, Sarah Vaughn, James Brown and the Jackson Five were among the many who won the amateur night competitions. When the Beatles made their first trip to New York in 1964, they said the Apollo was the place they most wanted to visit. When there were riots in Harlem in 1966, the Apollo was untouched.
But now, Ms. Blake said, "the sound stage and the recording studio are hardly ever used -- they're sitting there like a huge white elephant." She continued, "We have a facility to screen movies here, and there are no movie theaters in this area except for the Victoria," which is a few doors away.
"I started free movies for kids in this area," Ms. Blake added. "In the last four months, 8,000 kids have come through. I want to make this more of an educational and cultural resource for the community."
One way she wants to do this is by using the Apollo's technical equipment to train young blacks in a variety of film jobs. The theater has a wish list that ranges from filing cabinets to video equipment.
Ms. Blake's tasks include raising money, revitalizing the 10-member board and expanding the theater's artistic venues. She has instituted a "buy a seat" campaign to raise $12.5 million. Patrons can buy seats in tribute to any of the legion of stars who have graced the stage -- Aretha Franklin, the Jackson Five, Sammy Davis Jr., Josephine Baker, Count Basie, Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Ray Charles, Bill Cosby and many others.
Ms. Blake's plans for next month include a gospel tribute to Rosa Parks, the woman whose refusal to give up a bus seat in Alabama was instrumental in sparking the civil-rights demonstrations in the 1960's, and a black-tie benefit and tribute concert with Lionel Hampton.
In honor of Black History Month, "Good Day New York," on Channel 5, the Fox Network affiliate in New York, will broadcast its Feb. 27 show live from the theater, including a version of amateur night involving the "Good Day" staff. The doors open to the public at 5:30 A.M.
Ms. Blake, 59 and the mother of three, is a tall woman with a head of fluffy gray hair and an elegant but easygoing manner. She came to the United States from Trinidad during the desegregation upheavals of the 1960's and made the leap from a secretarial jobs to her film career after visiting the set of the Sidney Poitier film "For Love of Ivy." She was beguiled by the buzz of excitement and creativity. She worked as a production coordinator for films like "Prizzi's Honor" (1985), "All That Jazz" (1979) and "Eyewitness" (1981); a production assistant on "Shaft" (1971), and the executive producer of Spike Lee's "School Daze" (1988).
She is hoping that her film industry connections will work to her advantage in her new realm.
She has already brought members of the Directors Guild of America to Harlem. And in December, the theater was the setting of the Reebok International Human Rights Awards, which attracted Richard Gere and Ziggy Marley, among others.
But Ms. Blake's mission could not have come at a more difficult time, in the wake of the Dec. 8 arson fire that killed eight people in Freddy's clothing store, which is across the street from the Apollo. The fire, which the police have called racially motivated, was set by a black gunman in a white-owned store, and it followed protests by black demonstrators, who were angry that the store owner was evicting a black-owned record store.
A board member for the Apollo Theater Foundation, Evelyn Cunningham, says she believes the board needs fresh ideas to turn things around for the Apollo and that it needs young people with backgrounds in entertainment and law. But, she added, Ms. Blake has already raised morale by talking directly about the difficult tasks ahead and reaching out to people.
"It's no secret that the Apollo is in trouble," said Ms. Cunningham, a retired journalist who is active in civic affairs, "but Grace Blake has made a terrific difference already."

HEADLINE: Wall St.'s Top Woman Slips In the Back Door

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
MURIEL SIEBERT is probably the best-known woman on Wall Street. In 1967, she became the first woman to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. Several years later, she became the first woman to own and operate her own brokerage firm, Muriel Siebert & Company, a discount broker. Appointed by Gov. Hugh Carey as New York State Superintendent of Banking in 1977, she later drew the governor's ire in opposing the merger of Marine Midland Bank with the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
After an unsuccessful run in the Republican primary for a United States Senate seat, Ms. Siebert, known to all as Mickie, returned to Wall Street in 1982 and emerged as an oft-quoted market pundit and occasional critic of Wall Street practices. Lately, she has donated millions of dollars from her brokerage and securities underwriting business to help other women get their start in business and finance. 
 By cultivating the same brash attitude that characterizes Wall Street's most successful men, and by never taking no for an answer, the 63-year-old entrepreneur guaranteed that the women who followed her into high finance would never have to sneak in through the back door.
Which makes it all the more puzzling why Muriel Siebert & Company has decided to go public in a back-door way usually reserved for shadowy penny stocks -- through a merger with a soon-to-be corporate shell. In contrast to initial offerings, such maneuvers do not raise any cash for the new company. Even more peculiar, the shell in this case is a liquidating Brooklyn furniture company, whose only remaining asset will be its publicly traded stock.
Executives of rival discount brokerage firms expressed surprise at the decision, which Siebert & Company announced this month. "I really don't understand it," said Everett F. Lang, president of National Discount Brokers. "Everybody in the industry should be doing good in this market. To sell stock to the public, you've got to have good earnings and a good balance sheet. So it does raise the question why she's doing it this way."
Other questions abound as well. Ms. Siebert has groomed no clear successor at the firm, so investors betting on Siebert & Company's reputation -- and judging from recent prices of J. Michaels shares, paying dearly for the privilege -- are buying an unknown future. Ms. Siebert herself sees a potential shakeout among discount brokers, and while she aims to survive any upheaval, competitors question whether she has not already fallen too far behind.
As her own off-told biography makes clear, her life has never been conventional. She was born and reared in Cleveland, the daughter of a dentist. She attended but did not graduate from Western Reserve University. She came to New York in 1954 and was turned down by Merrill Lynch for a job because she did not have a college degree. Soon thereafter, interviewing at Bache & Company, she landed a $65-a-week job as an analyst -- only after lying that she had graduated.
And, yet today, a person of Ms. Siebert's stature easily has the kind of marquee name to bring public a growing, vibrant company. And being in the securities business herself, she could be expected to have the kind of know-how and connections to underwriters that should have come in handy.
That, together with the fact that demand for initial public offerings has been booming, has left Wall Street wondering why such a prominent woman is making her public debut in such an odd way.
Ms. Siebert acknowledges that she surprised a few people with the recent announcement -- "everybody but Mickie Siebert," she said, with the laugh of one who has made a career of catching Wall Street unawares.
Last year, 564 companies went public through initial public offerings, raising a total of $29 billion, the second-highest volume ever, according to the Securities Data Company. In contrast, only eight private companies went public by merging themselves into entities that were already publicly held.
"It's a very rare, unusual procedure," said Richard J. Peterson, an analyst with Securities Data. Such a maneuver is fraught with peril both for the surviving company and for investors, he added. "It should raise red flags whenever anything goes untraditionally."
Ms. Siebert explains that she aims to expand her business through acquisition, and that to do so she needs a currency to pay for those deals. Sellers of rival brokerage firms or asset management companies are more likely to accept publicly traded stock than shares in a private company, or to accept a cash deal that could create tax obligations, she said.
And she says her brokerage firm did not need the money that would have been raised in a public offering. "If I want capital, I can pick up the phone and make a private placement or sell stock stock in two seconds," she said. "But I don't want to be pressured by people saying 'What are you going to do with the cash?' "
SHE also attributes the decision to a more motherly instinct -- a way of protecting potential investors from themselves. "I know I'm a role model to some younger women," she said in an interview from her sensibly decorated office in Manhattan's red, oval "Lipstick" building on Third Avenue at 53d Street, surrounded by framed awards and pictures of herself with four Presidents.
Her long-haired chihuahua, Monster Girl, sat in attendance. "But I don't want people jumping up to buy this stock thinking that I'm going to do for the stock what I've done for myself."
Wall Street itself does not know what to make of the deal. When Ms. Siebert announced the preliminary deal in which her brokerage firm would merge with J. Michaels Inc., an operator of four soon-to-be-closed furniture stores in Brooklyn and one near Buffalo, J. Michaels's thinly traded stock nearly doubled in price, from about $10 to $18.
It's not likely that the entire $8 jump was because of the modest 2.5 percent stake that J. Michaels's previous owners are now getting in Siebert & Company. Certainly, at least some of the rise may be due to the strengthening expectation of a fat one-time dividend once the furniture company is fully liquidated.
But even after accounting for the potential liquidation proceeds of the company's noncash assets, J. Michaels shareholders appear to be putting a sky-high valuation on Muriel Siebert & Company.
J. Michaels already has $11 a share in cash sitting on its books. The remainder of its assets, however -- specifically, inventory, property and accounts receivable -- could take up to two years to liquidate, and might bring another $3 to $4 a share in proceeds. That leaves in J. Michaels's recent stock price at least another $3 to $4 a share that might be attributable to the anticipated stake in Siebert & Company.
Putting a $4 million value on top of J. Michaels's 900,000 shares appears to be a rich price for a mere 2.5 percent stake in a discount broker. It values the entire brokerage firm -- of which Ms. Siebert will end up owning 97.5 percent -- at close to $160 million, equal to roughly 27 times the company's own net worth. If Charles Schwab & Company were valued at the same ratio, its stock price would be four times what it is today.
A questionable valuation is not the only conundrum facing potential investors in Muriel Siebert & Company -- or current holders of J. Michael shares. They must face the question of what becomes of Muriel Siebert & Company once its founder moves on or is no longer available to promote the firm. Ms. Siebert brought in a chief operating officer, Nicholas P. Dermigny, in 1989, and more recently hired a former Salomon Brothers executive, Thomas Mead, to run the capital markets group. But she is the firm's president and sole shareholder for now, and there is no heir apparent.
"We do not have a succession plan, but we have a lot of good people here," she said. "With the staff and business I have now, I could take a year vacation and it wouldn't bother things a bit." She added that having publicly traded stock would allow the firm to offer other incentives, like an employee stock ownership plan, to new recruits.
QUESTIONS also have arisen about Ms. Siebert's personal life -- questions that become far more relevant if she is running a publicly held company, and questions that could have been expected to be raised by investment bankers conducting a traditional public offering.
In 1986, a profile of Ms. Siebert in Working Woman magazine noted, "Part of what Siebert calls the 'craziness' of Wall Street often involves drinking and drugs. Although she won't touch drugs, Siebert has been called a hard drinker. 'Part of this business still involves sitting down and drinking with people,' she says, 'and God help you if you can't drink.' During a recent business discussion with 'someone who likes to drink,' Siebert says, 'I matched him Scotch for Scotch. There is no double standard here.' "
Asked about the issue, Ms. Siebert responded forthrightly. "I had a tendency to drink too much," she said. "You have not seen that recently." Ms. Siebert said that even 10 years ago, business was conducted differently on Wall Street, and putting deals together over cocktails at lunch was common. "But I don't have two-martini lunches any more," she said. "It's not a problem."
She also added that much of the stress in her life came from dealing with a sister who was, for some time, institutionalized with mental problems. After their mother died 18 years ago, Ms. Siebert, who has never married or had children, was "left to deal with the whole thing."
The weight of that burden took its toll, she said, and discussing it clearly continues to weigh on her. Tears welled in her eyes as she unashamedly described the situation, and how, finally, she received counseling about the issue.
And she attributes her ability to deal with the family stress -- as well as the burden of constantly breaking down barriers in her professional life, to her friends. "They grabbed me and finally said, 'Mickie, you've got to let go of this,' " she said, explaining her eventual decision to seek out professional care for her sister.
Ms. Siebert continues to be admired by many people on Wall Street and in the financial industry. Her awards from civic groups are too numerous to detail. "She is highly regarded, diligent and professional," said Harrison Goldin, the former Comptroller of the City of New York, who worked closely with Ms. Siebert when she was the state Banking Superintendent.
Some of those contacts led, in fact, to the current deal in which Siebert & Company will go public. The two companies were introduced by Dan Jacobson, Siebert & Company's longtime accountant, who is now an executive of Richard A. Eisner & Company of New York, which also serves as the auditor for J. Michaels.
"The reason the deal works out so well," Mr. Jacobson said, "is that she didn't need to raise any additional capital."
Whether that is true is subject to question. Competitors note that capital and investment in new technology is what is pushing some discount brokerage firms ahead of the field, and in that area, Siebert & Company is lagging behind.
"She's too small," said Mr. Lang, of National Discount Brokers, a unit of the Sherwood Group, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange that trades at a much more down-to-earth 1.5 times net worth. "I agree with her understanding of where the market is going. When trading volume drops, there is going to be consolidation."
BUT as the chaff is separated from the approximately 400 discount brokerage firms operating today, Mr. Lang said, the surviving firms will need to continue to make large investments in technology and integrated systems, which process customer orders faster and cut costs.
Siebert & Company lags behind many rivals in several areas. The leading discount brokers have their own market-making operations, which trade thousands of Nasdaq stocks; Siebert has none. Many also clear their own trades, putting up their own capital to guarantee that trades are completed. Siebert does not. And while Schwab and the other leaders were early to give customers the ability to make on-line transactions, Siebert's on-line service started only in December.
This is one problem that Ms. Siebert's chosen method of going public will do little to rectify anytime soon. In contrast to a traditional offering, which raises money from the public for the business through the sale of new shares, this deal alters the firm's ownership without raising new capital.
Her plan will save some money by eliminating the customary fees paid to investment bankers. But, said Thomas C. Quick, president of Quick & Reilly, another rival discount broker whose stock trades for 2.2 times the company's net worth, "it might be penny-wise and pound-foolish." In particular, he warned, "you have to wonder what kind of liabilities they will be taking on by merging with this company."
Ms. Siebert says she does not think that is a problem. She says her brokerage firm generates enough cash flow on its own to support its business and even to invest in the future. She says she has been taking money out of the company, which is a "subchapter S" corporation, each year to keep taxes as low as possible. Private companies, which are not under pressure to produce quarterly earnings, often minimize their taxable income, to avoid paying tax on the money twice -- once at the corporate level and once after it has been paid out in dividends.
Now, she says, she can use that excess capital to reinvest in the firm. What's more, she said she could use the stock she is now acquiring as a type of currency, either by pursuing stock-for-stock acquisitions or by selling stock later in an equity offering.
For instance, Siebert & Company recently bought the discount brokerage accounts of Icahn & Company, a smaller competitor owned by Carl C. Icahn, the prominent investor who once owned Trans World Airlines. "We don't have the national presence we want," she explained, despite using national advertising and having a national "800" number. She said she would like to acquire, in addition to brokerage operations, a money management company or other businesses that would bolster her underwriting activities. That said, her rivals say it will be difficult to go on much of a shopping spree, given the size of her own firm and the limited amount of capital the surviving company is likely to have.
Despite her high profile -- or perhaps because of it -- Ms. Siebert has no shortage of enemies in the discount brokerage business. One reason: her advertisements bluntly attack her competitors as charging customers wasteful fees.
Ms. Siebert has also attracted much attention for her charitable donations -- she has established three foundations, including one that gives away half of the underwriting fees her firm earns on the sale of new securities. So far, the brokerage firm has donated $4 million. But rivals complain that Siebert & Company got much of that business using a since-repealed statute mandating that a certain portion of the underwriting of government securities be given to brokerage firms owned by women or members of minority groups.
As high as her profile has been, competitors expressed surprise that she would go public by merging with a furniture company, especially one that has had its share of problems.
As J. Michaels reported last March in its annual report, sales were slowing. An economic downturn hit particularly hard at J. Michaels's customers in the urban areas of Brooklyn and Buffalo. Moreover, 85 percent of its customers buy on credit -- paying 2 percent a month in interest for the privilege.
The company explained the situation in its annual filing for the fiscal year 1995 with the Securities and Exchange Commission: "A considerable portion of the Company's customers come from low-income groups to which the extension of credit may be deemed to involve a substantial credit risk," the report said. In the first six months of the 1996 fiscal year, which ends in March, bad-debt expenses rose to 8.5 percent of sales from 5.4 percent last year.
The company's chief executive, James Michaels, did not return phone calls seeking comment. But one thing is clear: now that the company is liquidating, it might have even more trouble collecting its debts than it did as a going concern.
None of which worries Ms. Siebert, who said she believed J. Michaels's business was clean. "If I had wanted a blind pool" -- that is, a company formed expressly for the purpose of merging with a private company -- "I could have gotten it," she said. Instead, she sought a merger with a company that had some history and long-term shareholders. J. Michaels, she said, "is not something that a lot of people bought already wanting to dump it."
In addition, "We were under no pressure to make a deal," she said. "I was aware that there would be questions. I could have stayed an independently owned firm and taken every dime out of the company except what I need for expansion. But we had a shot at doing something fun."
And while she has not decided what the publicly traded company will be named, she is sure of one thing. "It won't be called Michaels Furniture," she said. "I can tell you that."

2 Bills Intended to Stanch The Flow of Jobs

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
Like much of the Northeast, New Jersey has been losing jobs for the last decade, most recently the 7,000 cut by AT&T. Last year, Mercer County alone lost 6,000.
Now, the Legislature is considering two bills to create new jobs on a fast track. Under the first, any business that moved into the state and created at least 25 full-time jobs would get a grant to pay for up to half the relocation costs, not to exceed 80 percent of the tax revenue the new operation would generate. The second bill would pay employers for creating new jobs: 10 to 80 percent of the amount the new employees would pay in state income taxes. 
 Although the new legislative session is less than a month old, the bills, sponsored by Republicans in both houses, have already been released by committees in the Senate and Assembly, and the Assembly approved both measures on Thursday. The Assembly minority leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr., a Bayonne Democrat, said he agreed with the intent of the bills but wished they included provisions for the companies to return the money if the agreed-upon jobs were not created.

States Rally Round a Cry For Less

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
THE governors who came up with a compromise last week to try to resolve the Federal budget impasse were not on a humanitarian mission to bring peace to Washington by pulling combatants from the Capitol's mud-wrestling pits. The governors' goal was power: to gain freedom from longstanding rules that tightly restrict how they can spend Federal money on welfare and other programs.
But many of them are interested in more than just loosening the reins from Washington. They are also proposing to hand over some of that control to localities, the grunts of government. Counties and cities have long administered programs from Washington but rarely have had much role in shaping them. Such a change would further a growing movement to push authority over social policy closer to the people those policies are intended to benefit.

 
 
Power to the Counties
 
 "One of the things that the Governor has said time and time again is that we are not asking for devolution in order to transfer power back to the state capital," said John Truscott, spokesman for Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan, a Republican and a leader in revamping welfare. "We want to get it down to the counties."
The far-reaching changes backed by governors like Mr. Engler and George E. Pataki of New York would do away with a model for social programs from the 1930's. Grants of money, packaged with regulations, descend from the highest ranks of government to the lowest, with each level adding rules before passing on the funds. Also, anyone who meets certain requirements can receive assistance. Such rules are a legacy of an era when Federal officials believed that their state and local counterparts abused their authority.
Advocates for the poor are raising those fears again as the new plans evolve. They say the declarations of war on the old policy model, which are accompanied by homages to the wisdom of local officials and attacks on Washington bureaucrats, obscure a knot of questions. Are localities that are more accustomed to fixing traffic lights going to be able to master the dauntingly complex issues of social policy? With shrinking budgets, will there be enough oversight? Should states guarantee some minimum level of services? Would localities divert money intended for poor people to politically adept constituents?
Just as important, are these plans to fragment authority another way to shirk responsibility for deep budget cuts? Governments are under pressure to cut welfare and Medicaid, which are jointly financed by the Federal, state and, in some cases, local governments.
"It makes sense to reconsider which government performs which functions and how they are financed," said Steven D. Gold, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "But that should be decided on the basis of a careful consideration of what the effects are of different arrangements. It shouldn't be fiscally driven."
Under the governors' plan, approved unanimously at a meeting of the National Governors' Association in Washington last week, the Federal Government would cut billions of dollars and turn its allocations for welfare and Medicaid into lump-sum payments called block grants. The states, which until now have been granted dozens of waivers from Federal regulations but on a case by case basis, would have less money but more flexibility because many rules would be abolished. They could then do the same to their localities: cut funds but give them more leeway.
Many state officials insist money is not propelling devolution. When counties help design the rules, they can better adapt the programs to their areas, saving money and helping more people, officials say. That is an argument advanced by Mr. Pataki, who has called for the most sweeping devolution of any governor yet, proposing that New York give block grants to its counties for Medicaid, mental health and welfare.
 
 
 
The Specter of Mini-Bureaucracies
 But some critics wonder whether decentralization will create mini-bureaucracies. New York City's effort to decentralize its huge school system, for example, led to community school districts often criticized as bastions of mismanagement and patronage.
The states maintain that they will continue to monitor their counties despite shrinking budgets and fewer watchdogs. The difference, officials say, is that they are now more focused on whether a mother on welfare gets and keeps a job, rather than whether specific rules were followed in helping her.
"We care about the outcome, not necessarily if you cross the 't' and dot the 'i' exactly the same way in every county," said Michael L. Thurmond, who oversees welfare programs for Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia, a Democrat. "The outcome becomes more important than the process."
Governors are quick to imitate each other's policies, so the movement toward more local control is likely to pick up steam -- at least, perhaps, until a scandal somewhere raises concerns about accountability. Then power might swing back.
That happened during the Depression; many states asked Washington to take over relief programs intended to help the unemployed. Back then, few talked of how local officials were more in touch with program recipients and therefore the best administrators.
To some policy experts, the shift shows the cyclical nature of the debate. When politicians become frustrated with programs, they revamp them.
"Over the course of the last 65 or 70 years, we have had a back and forth about what is the nature of the Federal role and what are the financing arrangements that best carry out that role," said Linda Wolf, deputy director of the American Public Welfare Association, a bipartisan group representing social service agencies. "But trying to think of what the right intergovernmental relationships are has less to do with words like practical than it has to do with words like politics."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
Single Motherhood: Stereotypes vs. Statistics

BYLINE: By MARGARET L. USDANSKY 

 BODY:
NOTHING evokes fears that traditional family values are declining more than the steeply rising number of children born out of wedlock. The discouragement of illegitimacy is a major goal of proposed welfare changes that are edging closer to approval in Washington.
The compromise advanced by a bipartisan coalition of governors last week would empower states to deny benefits to children born to unwed women under the age of 18. 
 As illegitimacy has increased -- from 18 percent of births in 1980 to 31 percent today -- unwed mothers have become a symbol of growing disregard for traditional mores. Popular images depict these mothers as either affluent, white, college-educated and near the end of their childbearing years or poor, black, teen-age high-school dropouts. These women share a rejection of marriage as a goal, their critics say.
Yet a look at the actual profile of unmarried mothers raises some doubts about these assumptions. Yes, the vast majority of women having children outside marriage are poor or working class and poorly educated. But they are also diverse: nearly 40 percent are non-Hispanic white and 54 percent are in their 20's.
This profile suggests that rising illegitimacy can be viewed not only as moral issue but in the context of the social and economic changes of recent decades, particularly declining wages for lower-income men. And if welfare policy has played a role in encouraging illegitimacy, its importance pales, many experts say, in comparison to the impact of these changes.
 
 
 
Beyond the Grasp
 Studies suggest that young adults increasingly view marriage as an ideal that is beyond their grasp. "It's not that people don't want to get married," says Kristin Moore, a social psychologist with Child Trends Inc., a non-profit research center in Washington, who has studied attitudes toward marriage, "but many don't have the wherewithal to pull it off."
The odds of becoming an unmarried mother fall sharply as education rises. Almost 50 percent of births to high-school dropouts occur out of wedlock; among college graduates, the proportion is just 6 percent. Only 1 in 7 unmarried mothers has a family income above $25,000 the year her child is born; fully 4 in 10 report a family income below $10,000.
Teen-agers account for less than a third of all unmarried mothers, black teen-agers for less than 12 percent. For more than a decade, out-of-wedlock childbearing has risen fastest among women 20 and older, who now account for 7 of every 10 out-of-wedlock births. At the same time, married women are having fewer children, which inflates the share of out-of-wedlock births.
Contrary to popular opinion, unwed motherhood is often a transitory state. One quarter of out-of-wedlock births involve women who had been previously married but were divorced, separated or widowed before they became pregnant. Four out of every 10 mothers whose first birth occurs out of wedlock marry within five years. And some unmarried mothers are single only in the legal sense: 1 in 4 has a live-in relationship with a man, often, though not always, the child's father, which may encourage marriage later on.
Surveys find that most young adults want and expect to marry. According to a University of Michigan national survey, 90 percent of male high school seniors and 95 percent of their female classmates say that having a good marriage and family life is quite important to them, a small increase since the mid-70's. Results of the National Opinion Research Center show that high school drop-outs, who have the highest rate of illegitimacy, are just as likely as college graduates to say children are better off raised within marriage.
 
 
 
Where Welfare Fits In
 Many experts say unmarried motherhood may have more to do with economics than ideology. Most young adults say a man who wants to marry should be able to support a family, a standard fewer men without a college degree can meet. While falling wages can't explain all of the rise in out-of-wedlock childbearing, studies find that young women are less likely to marry in places where young employed men are scarce.
"Where the family values people totally miss the boat is in ignoring the tough economic times for people without a college degree," says Johns Hopkins University sociologist Andrew Cherlin. "When the economic basis for marriage has been eroding so seriously among the non-college educated, preaching values isn't going to do the job. Marriage is still highly valued, but people don't think it's a realistic possibility."
The conservatives' counter-argument that the availability of welfare, perhaps as a substitute for a husband's income, drives illegitimacy among the poor has widespread currency. (New Jersey has withheld additional benefits from unwed mothers on welfare who have more children; preliminary studies found a declining birth rate ).But studies including those cited in a recent report by Department of Health and Human Services suggest that welfare's role is relatively small. Little evidence supports the idea that many unmarried women become pregnant deliberately. This nation has one of the highest rates of unintended childbearing in the industrialized world: the proportion of pregnancies that are unwanted or mis-timed ranges from 40 percent among married women to 88 percent among never-married women.
"College-educated people are not just able to get a better job," says Ms. Moore, the social psychologist, "but to find a spouse and have their kids inside marriage and pass that along to the next generation. Marriage is another measure of who's able to make their lives work."

HEADLINE: The Official G.I.'s Guide to Staying Out of Trouble

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE United States Army has given its troops a few useful phrases for their stay in Bosnia:
"Stojte!" (Stop!). 
 "Pustite nas da prodemo!" (Let us pass!).
"Oruzje dolje!" (Put your weapon down!).
"Nemojte se micati!" (Don't move!).
While "A Soldier's Guide to Bosnia-Herzegovina" also has a pronunciation guide, the 16-page pamphlet that is the Army's official Baedecker for Bosnia is as revealing for what it omits as for what it contains. In its list of 33 essential Serbo-Croatian phrases there is nothing about how to order a beer in a cafe (If anybody wants to know, it's "Molim, jedno pivo!"). Or how to ask an attractive woman whether she is free this Friday ("Vidimo se u petak?").
Of course, this is almost certainly no oversight. American officials have made it clear they are trying to minimize contact with the civilian populace, no matter how lonely the young G.I.'s get in their muddy, boring surroundings. On this assignment, following the example set by the Persian Gulf warriors five years ago, the soldiers aren't allowed to drink at all, or to fraternize with the locals.
Nevertheless, there is some guidance for the soldiers that might seem a bit obvious to even a casual tourist: "Always act in a respectful manner when dealing with the local population; do not discuss politics or show partiality to any group."
And a stern warning: "Never interrupt when someone is in prayer. Remember, these people are the product of more than 1,000 years of history and culture. They can be easily insulted when they perceive any disrespect of them or their culture."
On the other hand, the pamphlet points up some of the less well-known folkways of Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia. Consider the touchy subject of hand signals.
Croats routinely hail each other by flashing what looks like the two-fingered Vietnam-era peace sign. American soldiers have been told not to reply in kind since the gesture is "very offensive" to Serbs who might be watching. Evenhandedly, the soldiers are also warned against trying out the Serbs' traditional three-fingered symbol of solidarity or exultation. "Either gesture could provoke a violent reaction," the Army explains.
 
 
 
See the Reporters? Be Nice.
 In a section intended to prevent miscommunication of another sort, the guide offers some common-sense advice for soldiers who meet the press for the first time. "Be honest," it says. "There is nothing wrong with saying, 'I don't know' or 'I can't tell you.' However, never lie to a reporter." (The guidelines, interestingly, were prepared at Army headquarters in Europe; in Washington, these rules are honored as much in the breach as in the observance.)
The guide is also crammed with useful facts that homesick soldiers can contemplate in their off-duty hours, in place of pursuing beer or companionship. For example, the population of Bosnia was 4,364,000 as of March 1991 ("little less than the population of the state of Georgia"). Bosnia covers 19,741 square miles ("which makes it slightly larger than Tennessee"). And Bosnia's economy ranked next to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav federation. (No attempt was made to come up with a comparison to an American state or region, probably because none of them even begins to compare.)
Perhaps the most daunting challenge for the authors was the section titled "History." In 39 clause-packed sentences, it takes the troops on a double-time march through the intricacies of the Balkan saga, beginning with the Roman Empire and ending with last year's Dayton accord.
A few salient items failed to make the cut. The guide, for example, alludes to something called the "Ustasha" regime in World War II Croatia. It does not explain that Croatia in those years was a Nazi puppet state that set up a concentration camp and murdered Serbs, Jews and Gypsies.
The guide also says Yugoslavia "became increasingly difficult to keep together" after the death of Tito in 1980. It does not mention the critical role played by the nationalist leaders Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman in whipping up the ethnic hatreds that sundered Yugoslavia in 1991.
And small wonder. Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Tudjman are the Presidents of Serbia and Croatia, respectively, and the United States worked long and hard with both of them to hammer out the Dayton agreement under which the G.I.'s are in Bosnia in the first place. Insulting them in print might not be the best of politics.
Another famous European statesman, often quoted in histories of the Balkans, also doesn't make the cut. This is Bismarck, the German who once remarked that the Balkans were not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.

In the Truce Line, A Vast New Divide

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
THE 1,000-mile-long demilitarization zone that curves through the snowy Bosnian countryside is more than a testament to the end of the war, at least for now, in the former Yugoslavia. It has also created a new and important fault line for cultural clashes that could define the wars of the next century.
Yugoslavia, and especially Bosnia, has been where Muslims, Eastern Orthodox and Western-oriented Catholics met and did battle for centuries. All these people are south Slavs (that's what Yugoslavia means) but with the collapse of Communism, the discrediting of fascism and the failure of East European-style liberal democracy here, their cultural differences have become paramount. The multi-ethnic fabric that permitted many Bosnians and other Yugoslavs to identify themselves as members of a nation-state rather than an ethnic group has been further weakened by the "ethnic cleansing" of the last four years. And the American-brokered peace plan essentially cements the partition of these ethnic groups inside the new frontiers. 
 Croatia, which once had a significant Serbian minority, is now almost entirely Catholic. Bosnia has been carved up among the Serbs, the Croats and the Muslims. Ironically, the only real multi-ethnic state left in the former Yugoslavia is Serbia -- although its minority groups have no significant political or economic influence.
Each of these new states is now firmly defined by its cultural and religious heritage. It is impossible in such states to gain full membership, as in Communist Yugoslavia, on the basis of adherence to an idea. Religion, as in much of the Middle East, defines identity. The Croats, for example, talk of the Croat community in Serbia, by which they mean Serbian Catholics. Only the Muslims have made an effort to preserve the semblance of a multi-ethnic society, but even this effort is waning, as illustrated by the recent resignation of Bosnia's former Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, the main champion of cosmopolitan democracy.
 
 
 
Religious Nationalism
 The warring factions are all now infected with the same disease, a myopic nationalism defined by religious heritage. Each feeds off the atrocities and excesses of the other. And each needs the other, in a perverse way, to reaffirm its exclusivity. The leaders have no interest in diluting their power by calling for new, more inclusive forms of national identity. It is no accident that each side went out of its way to destroy mosques or churches.
In addition, the new ethnic states within the nominal Bosnian federation are seeking to enter into alliances with outside powers.The Serbs look to the Greeks and Russians, with whom they share a common religious and political experience, having lived under either Ottoman or Czarist rule. The Croats, who were part of the Hapsburg empire and are more economically advanced, look to Germany and America. It is unclear what will happen with the Muslims, but it is not encouraging that the most pronounced strategic clash between a Western and non-Western civilization is being played out behind the scenes in Bosnia.
The Islamic rulers in Iran have shown themselves alert for opportunities to extend their reach, and clearly they see a chance here for a foothold in Europe. So Bosnia has become the modern version of the great game -- so much so that a promise that Iranian fighters and military advisers would be sent home was extracted from Bosnia at the Dayton peace negotiations.
Fifty years ago, in a battle that helped define another era, the Western allies and the Soviets fought for influence in Iran. Now Iran is playing a similar role in Bosnia.
Will the Muslim-dominated Government here lean more toward Teheran, which sent it weapons and money when the West wouldn't, or toward pro-Western Turkey, a more secular Muslim land that used to rule here and that has troops here now as part of the NATO peacekeeping force? On the most basic level, will the Bosnian Muslims define themselves exclusively by religion and Islamic culture?
The signs are not encouraging. The Bosnian Muslims, like secular Jews in Nazi Germany, have been handed an identity, even if it was not there before, by their persecutors. The attempt to maintain a mixed society saw hundreds of thousands of Muslims driven from their homes and thousands killed. And it was the Muslim radicals from places like Iran who came to aid Bosnia while the West kept an arms embargo.
The Muslims are well aware that the Iranians will be eager to help long after the NATO troops are gone. The West, the Bosnians have found, can be a fickle partner, and they know the Americans expect to pull out after one year.
 
 
 
Civilizations Differ
 Add to this the notion that civilizations really are different. The "universal values" promoted by the West are seen by many non-Westerners as a form of cultural imperialism. However much the Bosnian Government once pleaded for Western arms on the basis of its own cosmopolitanism, the fact is that it has been reduced to exercising authority almost exclusively over Muslims. And many of Bosnia's Muslims, like many Eastern Orthodox Christians, do not embrace such ideas as individualism and the separation of church and state. So there are at least the seeds of distaste for Western influence here -- one thing that the disenchanted Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Serbs, who feel totally misunderstood by the West, have in common.
On the sidelines, for now, are the Serbs. They were defeated in the last round, but may not be entirely cowed, as shown by their severing of contacts with NATO last week. Historically the Serbs have been the shock troops employed to battle the Ottoman hordes from the East, and they assume that in the years ahead they will resume that role. The possibility that there would be an overtly Islamic state in Europe, allied with Iran, is one of the main reasons the French opposed the establishment of Bosnia in the first place.
The battle along this new fault line may for now be a cold one, with all sides held at bay by foreign troops and by a mutual reluctance to resume the devastation of war. But it would be foolish to think that fighting could not begin again. The nature and timing of such a conflict is yet undefined, but the geographical location is set. It runs on rutted dirt tracks that are patrolled by the nearly 60,000 NATO-led troops who put the zone in place.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
It's Reaganomics, Alive and Irresistible

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H.

 BODY:
IN the minds of voters, the most important distinction between Bob Dole and Steve Forbes may not be that one has been a Washington insider for decades and the other has never held elective office. It may not even be that one must abide by rigid spending limits while the other has a seemingly limitless fortune to spend on his campaign.
No, as a political matter, the biggest difference between Bob Dole and Steve Forbes may turn out to be their prescriptions for the economy. 
 The difference comes with the return of what George Bush called "voodoo economics." Mr. Forbes, advocating economic principles that Ronald Reagan used 16 years ago to defeat Mr. Bush for the Republican Presidential nomination, promises a pain-free tax cut. Senator Dole holds the conventional view that lowering the Federal budget deficit is the most crucial step the Government can take, agonizing as it may be.
In Washington and in academic circles, the overwhelming consensus is that Senator Dole's position is the responsible one and that the supply-side theories Mr. Forbes espouses were largely discredited in the 1980's.
But out here on the campaign trail, with the Iowa caucuses tomorrow and the New Hampshire primary in another week, Mr. Forbes is breezing ahead with his advocacy of a flat tax so low that everyone's taxes would be reduced and his precept that Government revenues would increase as a result of the economic boom that would ensue. This theme has proved so popular that he has leapt to the front of the pack and may even be outpacing Senator Dole.
It is quite a turnabout in Republican politics. Mr. Forbes began his move in Iowa and New Hampshire just as the Republicans in Congress were shutting down parts of the Federal Government to reinforce their insistence on a balanced budget. So firm was their conviction that the Republicans had conceded that taxes could not be cut as much as they once hoped. For the sake of balancing the budget, they agreed to limit spending for popular programs like Medicare and student loans.
As the public contemplated the price of fiscal rectitude, the Republicans' popularity began to fall. But Newt Gingrich and his disciples stuck by their guns. They shut down the Government twice. Finally, they dragged President Clinton into proposing a seven-year balanced budget himself. Senator Dole, who has spent a political lifetime preaching fiscal discipline, could do little but march along every painful step of the way.
Then, from nowhere, came Steve Forbes. The dirty secret was revealed that a balanced budget might not be so popular after all. All the other candidates were forced to start talking about reducing taxes.
Whatever happens in the primary here on Feb. 20, the Republicans have no doubt learned the lesson that a free lunch is ever more politically palatable than bitter medicine. And it is a safe bet now that the winner of the Republican Presidential nomination will run on a platform that promises a tax cut.
The centerpiece of the Forbes campaign is his proposal to scrap the existing graduated income tax, with five brackets ranging from 15 percent to nearly 40 percent, and to abolish all deductions and all taxes whatsoever on interest, dividends, capital gains, inheritances and pensions. He would replace all this with a 17 percent tax on corporate profits and on wages and salaries after exempting $13,000 for each adult and $5,000 for each child.
The political attraction of the Forbes flat tax is not so much that it is flat as that it is low. In Mr. Forbes's formulation, almost everyone, from multimillionaire investors to families struggling to make ends meet, would get a tax cut.
Senator Dole obviously recognizes this -- now.
When Mr. Forbes first started to gain notice with his tax plan, the Dole campaign went on television with a commercial arguing, soundly, that a 17 percent flat tax would make it impossible to balance the budget. The Senator continued to slide in the polls, and Mr. Forbes kept gaining.
About 10 days ago, Mr. Dole began broadcasting an ad in which Gov. Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire, national chairman of the Dole campaign, makes the false claim that the Forbes plan would cost the average homeowner an additional $2,000 a year in taxes. After a few days, some polls suggested that the Dole slide had been arrested.
 
 
 
$200 Billion Short
 How can Mr. Forbes propose to lower everyone's taxes? The answer is that his plan would cost the Government $200 billion a year in lost revenue, according to calculations by the Treasury Department and private forecasters who use conventional economic models. For a flat-tax plan to raise as much money as the current tax system does, then it would have to hit most middle-income families with a tax increase -- hardly a favorable prospect politically.
Mr. Forbes dismisses such calculations as "bogus numbers." His plan, he says, would unleash the economy and create so much growth and personal wealth and corporate profits that the Government would collect more tax revenue than it does under the current system.
Four elections ago, when Mr. Reagan was making this argument, some respectable economists accepted it. Today, hardly any do.
Mr. Reagan inherited a deficit (the annual amount by which Government spending exceeds receipts) of $79 billion in 1981, and he immediately pushed through Congress a 25 percent tax cut over three years. By 1983, the deficit had nearly tripled to $207 billion, and it reached a high of $290 billion in 1992.
Because of a strong economy and deficit-cutting measures enacted in 1990 and 1993, the deficit last year was reduced to $164 billion. But as Herbert Stein, who was chairman of Richard M. Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, observes, the national debt (the accumulation of all the deficits over the years) is now more than 50 percent of the annual gross domestic product, compared to 27 percent in 1980.
"We could afford Ronald Reagan once," Mr. Stein wrote last week. "We cannot afford him again."
Gary and Aldona Robbins, economic consultants in northern Virginia, are perhaps the economists most bullish about Mr. Forbes's flat-tax plan. They estimate that while deficits might rise in the short run, economic growth would be so strong over the next decade and a half that the budget would be balanced by 2010 without any reductions in spending.
But the Robbinses represent a small minority in their profession. Benjamin M. Friedman, an economist at Harvard, said he does not personally know a single economist now who believes that an across-the-board tax cut would lead to an increase in revenues. And Norman B. Ture, who was Under Secretary of the Treasury and Mr. Robbins's boss in the early Reagan years, said of the Robbinses, "I sometimes am concerned by an enthusiastically favorable set of results they get."
 
 
 
Principles Subverted
 Economists like Mr. Ture who advocated the Reagan policies in the 1980's say the deficit exploded largely because the supply-side principles were abandoned. Taxes were raised several times after 1981. Government spending was not cut. Neither were Government regulations. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates high. All those policies, they say, worked to inhibit an economic boom.
Nonetheless, few of them now celebrate the glories of cutting taxes the way Mr. Forbes does.
"We have to be dedicated to balancing the budget," said Mr. Ture, who now runs a research center called the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation. "I think the proposition that tax reductions lead to revenue increases should be subjected to a great deal of skepticism."

Winter Overhauls, Spring Thrills

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Walt Jocketty is like a child who knows he's getting a cornucopia of toys for his birthday, but he still has to wait several days before he can open it and begin playing with them. Unlike the child, though, Jocketty knows what's in his sack. He just can't wait to see how the ingredients fit and play together.
"I'm extremely excited," Jocketty said last week, anticipating the start of spring training. "Everything has happened so quickly this off season I really haven't had a chance to sit back and enjoy it. We had some of the guys in town, and I can't wait to get down and see them in Cardinals uniforms. This town is on fire, they're so excited about Cardinals baseball." 
 Jocketty is the general manager who, given a mandate to resuscitate a slumping franchise, executed numerous moves this off season that could send St. Louis to the top of the National League's Central Division.
But the Cardinals are only one of several teams that eagerly await the start of spring training to find out how their winter overhauls look in the glaring light of Florida and Arizona sun. The Baltimore Orioles and the Yankees also worked feverishly and spared no expense to create new looks, leapfrogging through the winter in what appeared to be a game of one-upsmanship.
The Toronto Blue Jays and the Oakland Athletics, two of the most dominant American League teams recently, have new looks, too, but they don't resemble the teams that won multiple championships. In the cyclical world of sports, they, in effect, are starting over.
The first spring workouts take place Thursday when pitchers and catchers from 10 teams, including the Yankees and the Mets, open camps. The other teams will follow in the ensuing week, with the Montreal Expos the last team to begin spring training, on Feb. 22.
A year ago, teams opened camps with replacement players because the major league players were in the seventh month of their strike. No labor confrontation is on the horizon this spring, but the players and the owners continue to coexist without a collective bargaining agreement.
Unlike last spring, once the strike ended, that is, the union will not operate a camp in Homestead, Fla., this year. Not that they planned to have another camp for the unemployed, but relatively few players are without jobs.
Of the 138 players who became free agents in November, 116 have signed and several others, including Dave Winfield and Don Mattingly, have retired or taken a sabbatical. Of the 48 players who became free agents in December when they weren't tendered contracts, 40 have signed. Most notable among the unemployed from that group is Deion Sanders.
Most notably unemployed among managers is Sparky Anderson, who resigned after 17 years with the Detroit Tigers. Buck Showalter isn't back with the Yankees, but he isn't unemployed. He is in Arizona with the Diamondbacks-to-be and a seven-year contract worth nearly $7 million.
Buddy Bell has replaced Anderson, and Joe Torre has succeeded Showalter. Four other teams also have new managers -- Davey Johnson in Baltimore, Ray Knight in Cincinnati, Art Howe in Oakland and Tony La Russa in St. Louis.
"Signing the manager was the most important step in putting this together," Jocketty said when asked which of all his moves was his favorite.
Jocketty, a former assistant general manager in Oakland, lured La Russa away from the Athletics, who were happy to let the Cardinals pay his $1.5 million salary. La Russa brought some of his coaches with him, including Dave Duncan, the celebrated pitching coach.
To give Duncan some work to do, Jocketty signed Andy Benes as a free agent and acquired Todd Stottlemyre from the Athletics. He may still get Dennis Eckersley, the veteran closer, from the same source.
"We continue to talk," Jocketty said. "I would hope we get this thing resolved one way or the other before we both go to camp."
The Cardinals, who have plunged in the standings and at the gate, also signed left fielder Ron Gant, third baseman Gary Gaetti and second baseman Mike Gallego as free agents. They obtained shortstop Royce Clayton from San Francisco to replace the legendary Ozzie Smith or at least to nudge him over to second base.
"We've been holding back for a number of years," said Jocketty, who is in his second year as the club's baseball director. "This organization got a little stale the last few years and there was very little progress. The thing we had to do here was be very aggressive to try to jump-start this organization and get this town excited. We feel we have. We feel we have a fan base large enough to support what we're spending. But we had to get them excited."
The Orioles didn't have to make moves to excite their fans, who already cram Camden Yards. But Peter Angelos, the owner, wanted to give the fans a better product, one that had a chance to win a championship.
As a result, Johnson, the new manager, has Roberto Alomar at second, B. J. Surhoff at third, David Wells and Kent Mercker in the starting rotation and Randy Myers as the closer in the Orioles' quest to topple the Boston Red Sox and hold off the newfangled Yankees.
The team that let Johnson go, the Reds, has shed players like Gant, Wells and Benito Santiago to pare their payroll. The ever-imaginative general manager, Jim Bowden, has tried a different tact, going for the nostalgic look by bringing back Eric Davis and Chris Sabo.
The Chicago Cubs, who spent a strange winter while appearing not to be certain which direction they wanted to take, have a bit of nostalgia of their own. Ryne Sandberg is coming back after a year and half in retirement.
The Blue Jays, who not long ago won consecutive World Series, have retired their championship hopes for the present. Gone are Paul Molitor, Alomar, Devon White and many of the World Series pitchers. Some of the replacements are center fielder Otis Nixon and the starting pitchers Erik Hanson and Paul Quantrill.
The Athletics, who didn't wait until this winter to begin deteriorating, have jettisoned their outfield. Rickey Henderson is at the other end of the state in San Diego, Stan Javier is across the bay in San Francisco and Danny Tartabull is halfway across the country in Chicago with the White Sox.
The downsizing Kansas City Royals shed three-fourths of their infield -- first baseman Wally Joyner (San Diego), shortstop Greg Gagne (Los Angeles) and Gaetti (St. Louis). Gagne joins third baseman Mike Blowers in half of a new Dodgers infield.
The Seattle Mariners, another team paring payroll, gambled by trading Blowers and first baseman Tino Martinez and replacing them with Russ Davis and Paul Sorrento.
The Cleveland Indians, who overpowered the Mariners in the American League Championship Series, only got stronger, signing Jack McDowell for their starting rotation and Julio Franco to play first.
The Florida Marlins should be stronger, too, though probably not of World Series strength. Envious of the Colorado Rockies, their fellow expansionists who reached the playoffs in their third season, the Marlins spent a wad of the owner Wayne Huizenga's money. They signed White to play center and Kevin Brown and Al Leiter to pitch in their rotation.
The Minnesota Twins moved away from their usual pecuniary position and signed Molitor and Rick Aguilera, but the Aguilera move will be one of the most closely watched of the spring. After pitching in relief for five years, the 34-year-old Aguilera is becoming a starter again. It's not teaching an old dog new tricks, but it is trying to train an old dog to do an old trick.
For a real intriguing trick, the Philadelphia Phillies are trying one in freeing the weak-kneed Darren Daulton from his catching duties and sending him out to pasture -- in left field.
The champion Atlanta Braves had the quietest off season of all. They let five fringe members of their World Series roster go and added only one veteran -- the reserve outfielder Jerome Walton. They figure they are good enough to be up to their old tricks -- winning.

HEADLINE: Thomas Harris, 83, Elections Official And Labor Lawyer

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Thomas Everett Harris, a veteran labor lawyer who was one of the original members of the Federal Election Commission and served as its chairman, died on Tuesday in Alexandria Hospital in Alexandria, Va. He was 83 and lived in Alexandria.
The cause was brain injuries from a fall in his house, his family said. 
 Mr. Harris served as a Democrat on the bipartisan election commission from 1975 until his retirement in 1986. The commission, whose six members are appointed by Congress and the President, has exclusive jurisdiction over monitoring and enforcing campaign finance laws and reporting on campaign finance activities.
Some laws regarding political contributions and disclosure were on the books when the commission was created in the 1970's, but enforcement was lax.
When Mr. Harris was nominated for the commission, he was an associate general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. He was assistant general counsel for the Congress of Industrial Organizations, or C.I.O., before it merged with the American Federation of Labor, or A.F.L.
When the Federal Election Commission was formed, Mr. Harris was the only member with a solid background in campaign finance laws. His labor experience did not sit well with the National Right to Work Committee, which lobbied against his reappointment, but he went on to serve terms as vice chairman and chairman of the commission.
A native of Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Harris graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1932 and from Columbia University Law School in 1935. He clerked for Justice Harlan Fiske Stone of the United States Supreme Court and, apart from short stints in private practice, subsequently did legal work for the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Office of Price Administration, the Board of Economic Warfare in North Africa, the United States Military Government in Berlin and the Alien Property Division in Washington.
He started his career in labor law in 1948 as assistant counsel for the C.I.O. He was chosen for the post by Arthur J. Goldberg, then the organization's general counsel and later a Supreme Court Justice.
Mr. Harris is survived by his wife of 52 years, Margaret Samson Harris; their son, Thomas E., of Durango, Colo.; a son from an earlier marriage, Marvin B., of Doniphan, Mo., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Percy Z. Michener, 92, Engineer Of Chesapeake Bridge, Is Dead

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Percy Zell Michener, a master builder whose crowning achievement in 40 years as a civil engineer was the 18-mile-long Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, died on Feb. 2 in Scottsdale Memorial Hospital in Arizona. He was 92 and lived in Scottsdale.
Mr. Michener was the chief engineer and project manager of the marine project, which consists of two tunnels and a span of trestled bridges from Norfolk, Va., to the southern tip of Virginia's Eastern Shore. The bridge-tunnel invigorated the economy of the entire Delaware-Maryland-Virginia peninsula and saved drivers considerable time. It also allowed unrestricted ship traffic into Hampton Roads, one of the world's premier harbors. 
 Mr. Michener oversaw the $200 million project for nine years from its conception to opening day on April 15, 1964, when it replaced ferry service. He was the one who made the decisions from the moment his concern, Sverdrup & Parcel, consulting engineers of St. Louis, sent him from its Washington office in 1954 to see whether the crossing could pay for itself.
Starting without enough money to buy a pile driver, he ordered surveys of road traffic, ocean currents and the bay bottom, learned about Tidewater politics and bond sales, and got construction under way in 1960. He coordinated the efforts of five subcontractors and finished the job just six months behind his original timetable.
The American Society of Civil Engineers hailed the bridge-tunnel as a wonder of modern engineering on par with the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York, the Mont Blanc tunnel in the Alps and the system of dams that protects much of the Netherlands from the sea.
Mr. Michener said he liked all kinds of bridges, "steel, concrete, vertical lift, bascule, high-level, low-level, long-span continuous -- you name it." Why he was so attracted to bridge-building? "Why does a boy like an Erector set?" he said.
Mr. Michener was born in Alexandria, Ind., and graduated from the University of Illinois School of Engineering. After 15 years with the Illinois Department of Bridges, he was commissioned into the Army Corps of Engineers at the start of World War II. He supervised the construction of the 1,500-mile Canol Pipeline from Edmonton, Alberta, to Fairbanks, Alaska, and led the rebuilding of Manila Harbor.
After the war, he was hired as a vice president at Sverdrup & Parcel by his superior in the Corps of Engineers, Maj. Gen. Lief J. Sverdrup, a founder of the firm. Mr. Michener retired in 1965.
He is survived by a son, Dr. William Michener of Cleveland; two grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Old MacDonald Has a New Policy;
Sowing Confusion on the Farm

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
THE universe, the British scientist J. B. S. Haldane once said, is "not only queerer than we suppose but queerer than we can suppose." The same could be said of American farm policy.
Thus, even though the Senate last week took its most aggressive swipe in decades at streamlining the morass of law and regulation affecting American agriculture, only politicians on the campaign trail claim to be certain what was accomplished. 
 "This is really a historic change," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. "Farmers will finally plant for the market and not for the Government."
The bill passed after weeks of negotiation, in which Republicans who believe it will create a freer market extended the food stamp program and included enough environmental-protection provisions to convince many urban Democrats to join them.
The 500-page bill is still being scrutinized, but skeptics are already pronouncing it hopelessly flawed.
"This is the status quo in revolutionary drag," said Kenneth Cook, head of the Environmental Working Group, a Washington think tank that has been a leading critic of farm subsidies.
Broadly speaking, the Senate proposes to end farmers' reliance on subsidies that cost taxpayers billions of dollars a year. At the same time, the Senate promises to wipe out regulations that, according to backers of the legislation, tell farmers what, when and where to plant. The theory is that giving farmers "freedom to farm" will make them more productive and wealthier than the Government subsidies ever did.
 
 
 
7-Year Cushion
 In return for eliminating the current subsidies, the Senate is offering transition payments over a seven-year period. The payments are to help farmers prepare for the perils of a freer market in which bigger swings in prices are likely.
As it turns out, the transition payments would begin at a time when grain and fiber markets are so tight -- and prices so high -- that the payments could initially top what farmers would have received in the current programs. Unlike the transition payments, those programs are designed to pay most when times are hardest.
"It's like giving a signing bonus to people already in a welfare program," said Mr. Cook.
More important, the welfare program was not killed but given a seven-year timeout. In 2002, a particularly expensive version of the current programs would be activated unless Congress votes to complete the transition to unsubsidized markets.
Of course, even without the "freedom to farm" bill, farmers are free by any common-sense definition. The support programs that the Senate wants to end cover six crops: corn, wheat, cotton, rice, sorghum and oats. Farmers who don't like the regulations imposed over the years as the price of eligibility for the subsidies can grow those crops any way they want, and forgo the subsidies, or they can grow something else. Indeed, about 70 percent of the roughly $180 billion in total revenue received by the nation's farmers each year comes from crops and livestock outside the subsidy programs.
To be sure, the covered crops are important. They account for nearly 75 percent of all planted acres. And other sectors of the agricultural economy, such as livestock, are dependent on them. But when politicians and farmers talk about "freedom to farm," they are really debating the price taxpayers and consumers are willing to pay to promote stability in this part of the farm economy.
The current wisdom is that taxpayers and most farmers would rather take their chances on a free market. Democrats who led the opposition in the Senate say that today's high prices for crops are distorting assessments of the long-term value of the subsidy "safety net."
The price supports grew out of programs begun in the 1930's to carry growers of major crops through lean years. The goal was not just to help rural America but to assure urban consumers of plentiful supplies and low prices -- goals that economists agree have been achieved. But changes in farming have made the price support programs financially unpredictable and politically unbearable.
Since the 1930's, the total number of farmers has plummeted to less than 2 million. The "average" farmer has become a millionaire by some measures -- if one looks only at the value of their land and machinery. But their debts and the low return on those assets force most to rely on outside jobs to make a living. Just 300,000 full-time farmers account for 80 percent of production.
That puts the Government in a bind. Traditional subsidies have been tied to output -- the more a farmer produces, the higher the subsidy when prices are low. Treating all farmers equally keeps big farmers in the program, which helps insure that soil conservation measures and other environmental programs tied to the subsidies are widely applied. It also makes it easier for the Government to reduce total output when stocks are abundant, which then leads to higher prices and lower subsidies the following year.
The politically embarrassing result, though, is that some of the nation's biggest farms get millions of dollars in subsidies. Despite regulatory tinkering to impose limits on what individual farmers could receive, just 2 percent of farmers receiving crop payments from 1985 to 1994 got 27 percent of the nearly $109 billion paid out, according to one study. At the same time, the more controls the Government imposed, the more farmers began to see the programs as overly complicated and increasingly chintzy -- in short, not worth fighting for.
Even if the policy changes in the Senate bill stick, it will barely dent the interlocking array of Government influences over agriculture: trade barriers, water rights, regulation of biotechnology. The list of subjects for more 500-page bills remains formidable.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
A Beggar's Request That Began a Tradition of Giving

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
On Christmas Day in 1911, a prosperous businessman finished his turkey dinner and decided to go for a stroll on the streets of New York.
What happened to him resulted in the creation of a philanthropy that has helped poor New Yorkers ever since. 
 The businessman was Adolph S. Ochs. In 1896, a century ago this year, he had bought The New York Times, become its publisher, set it on a path toward serious, trustworthy journalism and seen his vision rewarded.
He had every reason to be content as he set out on his stroll that Christmas day 84 years ago. New York then was a city of some 4.8 million people in a nation of 94 million.
William Howard Taft occupied the White House. The trust-busting Supreme Court had dissolved the Standard Oil trust that year and was moving against United States Steel. Roald Amundsen of Norway had beaten Robert F. Scott of Britain to the South Pole. The Dow Jones average that year ranged no higher than 86, no lower than 73.
For many residents, times were good and life full of fun and promise. On Broadway that year, theatergoers could see George Arliss in "Disraeli," Maude Adams in Rostand's "Chantecler," Ina Claire in "The Quaker Girl" and, of course, the "Ziegfeld Follies."
But the unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent, and then, as now, times were harsh for many people in that city of 4.8 million.
As Mr. Ochs walked along, he was accosted by a shabby beggar.
The beggar said that he, too, had just eaten Christmas dinner -- at the Y.M.C.A. But he had no money for lodging and nowhere to sleep. Mr. Ochs gave him a few dollars. The encounter set Mr. Ochs to thinking about charity. Helping a stranger had given him a sense of satisfaction, and he began to wonder if that individual act could be the foundation for a citywide expression of good will.
As Christmas approached in 1912, Mr. Ochs asked his news executives to send a reporter to several of the city's private welfare agencies to collect the stories of New York City's 100 neediest cases. His plan was to publish 100 short, unemotional stories about New York's poor.
On Sunday, Dec. 15, 1912, when readers of The Times turned to their magazine section, they saw a headline that said: "Santa Claus, Please Take Notice! Here Are New York's 100 Neediest Cases."
The appeal began with these words: "Fathoms deep beneath the exhilaration and joyousness of Christmas, there is a world of desolation and hunger which few of the dwellers in light and air have had time or chance to realize: the world of famine in the midst of plenty; of cruel heart and body, hunger with bounty in sight, but not in reach; the world which only the organized charities have been able to hold above the line between life itself and death."
The case histories spoke for themselves.
There was the tuberculosis-racked family whose insane father was confined to an asylum. Three of his seven children were already ill; three others were underfed, and their mother was exhausted and rarely able to earn more than $5 a week.
There was the widow, almost blind, laboring in a brush factory for $5 a week, trying to feed her two children. There was the injured longshoreman, a father of nine, all supported by a daughter barely of working age, toiling as a department store cashier.
There was the wife, demoralized when she learned her husband was a leper. That was when her health began to fail. Their 10-year-old daughter was a helpless cripple, and there were two younger children, one of them scarcely old enough to walk. Before long, there would be no food, no shelter.
That first year, 117 contributors sent in $3,630.88. The Times's campaign for the neediest cases became an annual event that inspired other newspapers in the United States and abroad to follow its example. In 1994-95, 12,868 donors gave $4,526,919.95 to the fund. Through yesterday, contributions to the current campaign stood at $4,257,773.62. The campaign, which began at Thanksgiving, runs through the end of this month.
Mr. Ochs died in 1935. In December 1937, in an article in Reader's Digest, L. H. Robbins wrote of Mr. Ochs and the Neediest Cases:
"It was his best-loved project."
 
Previously recorded $4,249,601.07
Recorded Friday $8,172.55
 
Total $4,257,773.62

Something darn strange is going on.
Maybe it's because everyone in Iowa is so darn nice. Or maybe it's because the Iowa caucuses are so darn incoherent, offering a cacophony of messages but no symphony of discourse. 
 But suddenly my darn computer is sputtering optimism. I can no longer assert my will over my Thinkpad. It is upbeat, it is inchoate, it is corn on the Fourth of July -- oh my gosh, everything on the screen looks like that USA Today column by . . . Larry King!!!
Larry, who's here this weekend, likes dots and life-affirming exclamations, random questions . . . ellipses: "Has any Republican candidate really excited you so far? . . . Anybody hear from Moammar Gadhafi lately? . . . Is there a more vital actor than Antonio Banderas? . . . Why do certain types of candies taste better in movie theaters than outside? . . . Count me in favor of Puerto Rico as our 51st State."
Gee, I wish there were an escape key to stop sounding sounding like Larry. Never mind. I'll try again. Sunday column, take two:
DES MOINES!!!
Sunshine, lollipops and flat taxes here today . . . Who wants a bumpy tax, anyway? Count me out . . . Here we are in the only place on earth where the word ethanol is an applause line . . . If Pat Buchanan is a member of the Knights of Columbus, then count me in as a member of the Days of Columbus . . . How can Mr. Crossfire trash Washington pundits as "those folks"? Go figure!
Questions, questions, questions: Why do they call it the Heartland? Don't the rest of us have heart? . . . If we all know that the New Hampshire state motto is "Live Free or Die," why don't we know the Iowa state motto? . . . Is there a more vital neopragmatist than Richard Lugar? . . . If supply-side economics works, why doesn't Jack Kemp have a real job? Right? Right. . . . Charlton Heston can part the Red Sea, but can he save Phil Gramm? Chuck campaigned with Gramm here on Saturday. The guy must know something we don't know. . . . Why the heck didn't he win an Oscar for "The Ten Commandments"? Holy Moses!
Notes 'n' Comments: You look up funny in the dictionary and you find Alex Castellanos. After $20 million and no results, the Gramm media adviser can still make jokes. "If good looks and charisma were requisites, Steve Forbes wouldn't have caught on," Alex told me. "He looks like you open a panel in his back and change the batteries." (Better find your guy some of those batteries, Alex!)
Did you know that: Steve Forbes never blinks . . . For that matter, Brian Lamb never blinks . . . Bob Dole has a nice smile . . .
My 2 cents: How come Bob Dole has been running for President so long and still doesn't have a "Shining City on the Hill" speech? Come to think of it, he doesn't have any speech. His idea of an audience grabber is "My fingerprints have been all over farm legislation" . . . Mari Maseng Will, phone home . . . Now that "Anonymous" has sold the rights to his/her novel to Mike Nichols, who will play Hillary? My pick: Emma Thompson. The lady can act!
Cornfield musings: Iowa is so flat . . . Is that why it likes the flat tax? . . . Is there a better team with a losing record than Morry Taylor? "This is America," Morry says, "We speak English here." Can't argue with that. . . . And kudos to Morry for trying to stop that regulatory madness.
Makin' bacon: Some TV reporters trying to do standups at hog farms have had trouble with the hogs celebrating Valentine's Day early . . . Pity the newsies, stranded on manure lagoons . . . The Marriott gift shop sells musical pig candles that play "Love Me Tender."
Quickie Quotes: Pat Buchanan on gun control: "I think you need a steady aim" . . . Bob Dole in Oskaloosa, "Let me add right quick that Elizabeth is not going to be in charge of health care -- she may have a little blood bank in the White House" . . . Phil Gramm to a female reporter: "I don't feel it's right that you're out here working, standing on ice with your high heels on, to pay taxes to put people in prison."
Loose ends: Sabina (pronounced like "nothin' could be finah") Forbes has taken to the airwaves to defend her man. She looks formidable . . . Watch out, Hillary! . . . The candidates went to a rally for the National Campaign to Protect Marriage. I'm outta here . . .

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: The China-and-Taiwan Problem;
How Politics Torpedoed Asian Calm

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
TEN months ago, China and Taiwan were on the verge of opening their seaports to each other's shipping and inaugurating direct air service across the Taiwan Strait for the first time in nearly 50 years of barely suspended civil war. Now suddenly, pistols are drawn and the threat of military confrontation hangs in the air like grenade smoke.
How such a reversal could so suddenly threaten the stability of Asia is a drama in which there are four players, each with its distinctive contribution to the crisis. The first is the Republican Congress, which has spawned the most energetic coalition ever assembled to openly confront China while the second player, the Clinton Administration, has sought "engagement." Congress has promoted independence for Taiwan and Tibet, and it proposes sanctions every time China is found wanting on human rights, nuclear proliferation and the theft of a Mickey Mouse trademark.
 
 
 
Doing Business
 Often lost in the American debate on China is the fact that for two decades, the Chinese on the mainland and on Taiwan have been getting richer, doing more business together, negotiating greater cultural exchanges and conducting a broader political dialogue than ever before. Millions of Taiwanese tourists have visited their ancestral homes on the mainland, renewed old acquaintances and forged new ones. An estimated $20 billion in Taiwan investment has migrated to the mainland's cheap labor markets and unofficial conversations between Beijing and Taipei became the rule, not the exception.
But instead of nurturing this environment, many in Congress have allied themselves with the political machine of Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, the third player in the piece.
To straddle the divided politics of Taiwan, Mr. Lee has been forced to court Taiwan's pro-independence voters, now thought to be nearly a third of the island's electorate. At the same time, he adheres to the Nationalist Party creed that reunification of China is the ultimate goal. In this schizophrenic environment, Mr. Lee's popularity goes up every time he strikes a blow for Taiwan's international image; playing the American card has been the key to his strategy. In Washington, his political operatives tap American revulsion for Beijing's repression to enhance Taiwan's leverage in the running dialogue with the mainland.
Armed with Congressional backing, Taiwan has been emboldened by its own success into ever more energetic efforts to increase its leverage, including the now famous trip to Cornell University. To the average American, Mr. Lee's trip to upstate New York seemed innocent, even admirable. Wasn't the issue freedom of travel? In fact the trip was part of President Lee's strategy to change the political status of Taiwan. If there needed to be any other reminder, the trip occurred in the same year that Mr. Lee offered the United Nations a $1 billion gift in an unavailing effort to win a seat there.
 
 
 
Wearing Fig Leaves
 President Clinton's abrupt decision in May 1995 to let Mr. Lee visit -- a first-of-a-kind trip for a Taiwan leader -- nearly ripped away the last shred of the fig leaf put in place when President Richard M. Nixon normalized relations with China. The fig leaf was enshrined in the Shanghai communique of 1972:
"The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position. It reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves." This simple statement, and China's consent to it, shelved the Taiwan problem, and allowed the United States to safely begin removing its military forces from the island. Thus the Taiwan question moved from belligerency to political deferral. Taiwan could take charge of its own destiny. It could walk, talk and act like a country and America would switch its diplomatic recognition to Beijing.
Even though it was a cold war instrument that put Beijing and Washington in common cause against Soviet expansion, the Shanghai communique ushered in the longest period of Asian peace and stability in this century and made it possible for Asia's vibrant new economies to emerge.
The latter-day strategies of Lee Teng-hui to enlarge Taiwan's political identity have attracted sympathy because of the actions of the fourth player in the drama, the Communist Party leadership in Beijing. Nothing has energized Taiwan's determination to stay separated from the mainland as much as the mainland's totalitarian ways. Since the Tiananmen massacres of 1989, Taiwanese have asked themselves why anyone would want to reunify with a government that disparages the very sort of democracy they have cultivated.
As Taiwan has sought protection against the unwanted advances of an increasingly brittle Chinese leadership, those advances have become all the more insistent. A new generation of Chinese leaders, none of whom possesses the vision or self-confidence that Deng Xiaoping showed in his prime, has seized on reunification with Taiwan as a kind of manifest destiny and as a means to tap the latent nationalism of the military, the party and of many ordinary Chinese.
 
 
 
A Temptation
 Many Americans are now tempted to enter this fray on the side of Taiwan, to pursue confrontation or containment of the mainland. After all, why continue to sacrifice American ideals on human rights, democracy, trade and proliferation of nuclear poison to a set of outdated cold war agreements? Hasn't the Shanghai communique been overtaken by the reality of Taiwan's flowering as a powerhouse economy and a robust culture that every day disproves the silly notion that respect for law and human rights cannot coexist with the Asian tradition?
But this also is a trap for America, which spent much of the 1950's and 1960's in full battle dress, with American troops and nuclear weapons stationed on Taiwan and, still, Beijing never changed. The Shanghai communique allowed everyone to put away the guns. The strategic weight of China as a foil against the Soviet Union may be gone, but it has been displaced by China's strategic weight as an Asian power whose political evolution is somewhere on the horizon. So all of Asia has a stake in a stable outcome.
The China-Taiwan dispute is a suspended civil war, easily as complicated as Bosnia and much grander in scale. If President Clinton speaks bluntly to Beijing and underscores his bluntness with a display of American military resolve, that runs the risk of inciting Taiwan's independence movement even further.
And then it would be easy for Taiwan to openly declare greater autonomy or outright independence.China specialists who travel to both sides of the Strait fear that such a spiral could lead to war.
On the other hand, the United States could speak about the benefits to both Beijing and Taipei of stepping back, giving up any notion that either side can end a 46-year estrangement through unilateral actions, whether those actions are military (in Beijing's case) or political (in Taiwan's case).
If war comes, China's antiquated military would certainly come out the loser, but this is hardly the point. As irrational as it seems, the prospect of losing is not likely to deter the People's Liberation Army. Its logic rests on the belief that China is willing to make a greater sacrifice, suffer more destruction than America or Taiwan, in order to prevail on a fundamental issue of sovereignty. There would be no winners in a clash of such magnitude.
And it is worth remembering that while China is now ruled by faceless and unimaginative Communist bureaucrats, it is populated by 1.2 billion Chinese, most of whom look up to America and hope that America will help them, not confront or contain them, in their quest to join the developed world.

HEADLINE: Blockade of Oil Wells in Mexico Could Imperil Election Reforms

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 10

 BODY:
A blockade of dozens of oil wells in southern Mexico by local Indians and members of an opposition political party has cost Mexico more than $8.5 million in lost revenues over the last 12 days, officials say, and is creating a political standoff that threatens national electoral reforms.
Dozens of demonstrators protesting environmental damage caused by drilling operations of the state oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, have been injured or arrested in recent days as the Government has taken increasingly harsh steps to clear the way to 59 oil wells in the coastal state of Tabasco. 
 In some instances, army units have been called in to back up the police, setting off melees that have resulted in injuries to many, including Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a senior member of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party. Mr. Lopez Obrador was the defeated candidate in a hotly contested 1994 gubernatorial election in Tabasco.
Prosecutors have asked the local judge to issue an arrest warrant for Mr. Lopez Obrador on charges of obstructing a federal installation.
Whether the prosecutors will actually try to detain Mr. Lopez Obrador, who is a candidate for the presidency of his party, is not at all clear. His arrest would be certain to heighten political tensions both in Tabasco and in Mexico City.
The blockades have already taken on more of a political tone than an environmental one, and have upset a fragile agreement that just last fall brought all four major political parties back to the table to work out electoral reforms in time for the 1997 congressional elections.
By all accounts, the environmental record of Pemex is a nightmare. The oil wells in Tabasco are among Mexico's richest, but the rush to extract the oil without proper safeguards has turned great sections of the state into a toxic swamp where oil seeps up through the ground and rivers are so polluted they catch on fire.
The president of Pemex, Adrian Lajous Vargas, conceded at a news conference on Friday that the company harmed the environment in the 1970's and 1980's, but said that the company is more careful now and that local people have been adequately compensated for any damages. He estimated that the blockades have cost Pemex and the Mexican Government $8.5 million in lost revenues, but added that these losses would not affect guarantees by the Government last year to use oil sales to back up the $12.5 billion in American loans to ease the country's economic crisis.
Mr. Lajous expressed concern that unless Pemex crews can get in to maintain the oil wells and pumps there could be a serious accident.
But the environmental issue has at times seemed only a pretense for a mounting civil resistance campaign that threatens the shaky government of Gov. Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a member of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Governor Madrazo is being investigated by the federal Attorney General on charges of having violated election laws by spending $70 million in his 1994 campaign. Fewer than 500,000 people voted in the Tabasco election.
Soon after that election, Mr. Lopez Obrador headed similar blockades and protests in Tabasco. The pressure was so great that the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo at one point was ready to make a deal to remove Mr. Madrazo from office. But local P.R.I. leaders, with Mr. Madrazo himself in the lead, broke ranks with the central Government and refused to give up the statehouse, scuttling the deal and setting off a constitutional struggle over states' rights that is still unresolved.

HEADLINE: In the Super Bowl of Sports Stuff, the Winning Score is $2 Billion

BYLINE: By Robert Lipsyte 

 BODY:
With all the mystical assurance of an ancient seer reading entrails, Steve Mann planted his feet on an upper rim of Atlanta's Georgia Dome last week, hefted a little metal toy truck and declared: "Baseball is dead."
Mann, a lanky 31-year-old redhead with an all-American smile, is the sales manager for Ertl Collectibles of Dyersville, Iowa, where the movie "Field of Dreams" was shot. But Mann is a realist. The truck in his hand, modeled after a 1938 Chevy panel, bore the colors and logo of the Texas Rangers. It was not selling well at $14.99, said Mann, because collectors were turned off by "baseball strikes and $8 million players." 
 On the other hand, the 1956 Ford pickup with Notre Dame colors and a piggy bank slot was doing well. People felt better about football and colleges.
"This is a goofy, vicious, live-for-now, get-it-while-you-can business," said Mann. "Sports collectibles may be a niche business, but it's just like sports."
Just like sports. From niche to Nike, the Super Show, advertised as the world's largest sporting goods trade fair, offered 10,000 booths of hard-charging sales jocks with this season's live-for-now products, from Grant Hill notebooks to Air Much Uptempo shoes. There were athletes to be sure -- Frank Thomas for Reebok, Nadia Comaneci for Danskin, Marcus Allen for Logo Athletic among dozens -- but they were peripheral to products.
Without the distractions of games, the marketing of athletic shoes, apparel, equipment and bric-a-brac becomes a vivid reflection of the flamboyant, winner-take-all world of sports. Or is sports a reflection of the life-or-death business world? The numbers on the Super Bowl scoreboard represent touchdowns and field goals, mere symbols for the numbers on the Super Show scoreboard representing dollars and market share.
Early in the four-day show, the president of Nike, Tom Clarke, talked about how "the power of sport" enabled the nation-state of swoosh to "crack $2 billion" in apparel growth in 1995. He said that the "inspiration of sports allows us to rebirth ourselves constantly." If there was any doubt that he was talking new product, not New Age, another Nike executive, Steve Gomez, clarified the issue when he said that the juggernaut had entered the college football market with a "quest to own Saturdays."
Bad-mouthing Nike's muscling ways was a sideshow at the Super Show that rang hollow, especially from other powerhouses with prime locations at the Georgia World Congress Center, huge multimedia booths, dancing girls and access restricted to those with appointments. But over in the satellite location, the Georgia Dome, where the mom-and-pops and the licensang trickle-downs strutted their stuff, there was mostly admiration for Nike and hopes of something swooshing their way.
"We may get a shot silk-screening a little for Nike," said the president of APSCO, Phil Livoti, one of two guys named Phil who own the Brooklyn apparel and embroidery firm. A third Phil, the Nike founder Phil Knight, could jump them into the big time. They have a line of Mickey Mantle shirts, licensed by the Manhattan restaurant. They still bask in the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs when Dennis Ingberg, the marketing v.p., kept his finger on the factory's red button through the sixth and seventh games so they could start rolling those Ranger shirts for Sears and J. C. Penney.
Sporting goods people seem to feel ennobled enough by the trademarked triumphs and tragedies of prime-time sports not to worry too much about the seamier doings on their own sidelines. The "sneakers-to-die-for" controversy of several years ago has faded; after all, went the spin, poor youngsters killed for certain brand-name sunglasses and winter jackets before they started killing for athletic shoes.
And the recurring charge of slave labor by third world children making sneakers and active wear has been countered by those who claim that only by keeping an economic presence in a country, no matter how vile the conditions, can there be hope of reform. The sexier issues of bad behavior by the major league models who keep the mills grinding seem to obscure the real violence.
And then there was Howard Schwartz, president of the Sherwood Group of Rockville, Md., makers of flags and pennants, who was displaying an Orbs EcoSpun sweatshirt manufactured from six plastic liter bottles and an equal weight of mill end fabrics. It was a "responsible garment with a story," but Schwartz had yet to find a responsible coach to outfit his varsity with such shirts and hats; it should be a winning coach with the kind of appeal that would allow him to choose saving the planet over Planet Reebok.
Which brought us to another moment when niche met Nike. "Imagine if Nike took this product on," said Schwartz. "How many plastic bottles they'd need."
Just recycle it.

HEADLINE: MAIN STREET, JAPAN: For Better or for Worse;
Who Needs Love! In Japan, Many Couples Don't

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: OMIYA, Japan

 BODY:
Yuri Uemura sat on the straw tatami mat of her living room and chatted cheerfully about her 40-year marriage to a man whom, she mused, she never particularly liked.
"There was never any love between me and my husband," she said blithely, recalling how he used to beat her. "But, well, we survived." 
 A 72-year-old midwife, her face as weathered as an old baseball and etched with a thousand seams, Mrs. Uemura said that her husband had never told her that he liked her, never complimented her on a meal, never told her "thank you," never held her hand, never given her a present, never shown her affection in any way. He never calls her by her name, but summons her with the equivalent of a grunt or a "Hey, you."
"Even with animals, the males cooperate to bring the females some food," Mrs. Uemura said sadly, noting the contrast to her own marriage. "When I see that, it brings tears to my eyes."
In short, the Uemuras have a marriage that is as durable as it is unhappy, one couple's tribute to the Japanese sanctity of family.
The divorce rate in Japan is at a record high but still less than half that of the United States, and Japan arguably has one of the strongest family structures in the industrialized world. As the United States and Europe fret about the disintegration of the traditional family, most Japanese families remain as solid as the small red table on which Mrs. Uemura rested her tea.
A study published last year by the Population Council, an international nonprofit group based in New York, suggested that the traditional two-parent household is on the wane not only in America but throughout most of the world. There was one prominent exception: Japan.
In Japan, for example, only 1.1 percent of births are to unwed mothers -- virtually unchanged from 25 years ago. In the United States, the figure is 30.1 percent and rising rapidly.
Yet if one comes to a little Japanese town like Omiya to learn the secrets of the Japanese family, the people are not as happy as the statistics.
"I haven't lived for myself," Mrs. Uemura said, with a touch of melancholy, "but for my kids, and for my family, and for society."
Mrs. Uemura's marriage does not seem exceptional in Japan, whether in the big cities or here in Omiya. The people of Omiya, a community of 5,700 nestled in the rain-drenched hills of the Kii Peninsula in Mie Prefecture, nearly 200 miles southwest of Tokyo, have spoken periodically to a reporter about various aspects of their daily lives. On this visit they talked about their families.
 
Survival Secrets
Often, the Couples Expect Little
Osamu Torida furrowed his brow and looked perplexed when he was asked if he loved his wife of 33 years.
"Yeah, so-so, I guess," said Mr. Torida, a cattle farmer. "She's like air or water. You couldn't live without it, but most of the time, you're not conscious of its existence."
The secret to the survival of the marriage, Mr. Torida acknowledged, was not mutual passion.
"Sure, we had fights about our work," he explained as he stood beside his barn. "But we were preoccupied by work and our debts, so we had no time to fool around."
That is a common theme in Omiya. It does not seem that Japanese families survive because husbands and wives love each other more than American couples, but rather because they perhaps love each other less.
"I think love marriages are more fragile than arranged marriages," said Tomika Kusukawa, 49, who married her high-school sweetheart and now runs a car repair shop with him. "In love marriages, when something happens or if the couple falls out of love, they split up."
If there is a secret to the strength of the Japanese family it consists of three ingredients: low expectations, patience, and shame.
The advantage of marriages based on low expectations is that they have built-in shock absorbers. If the couple discover that they have nothing in common, that they do not even like each other, then that is not so much a reason for divorce as it is par for the course.
Even the discovery that one's spouse is having an affair is often not as traumatic in a Japanese marriage as it is in the West. A little sexual infidelity on the part of a man (though not on the part of his wife) was traditionally tolerated, so long as he did not become so besotted as to pay his mistress more than he could afford.
Tsuzuya Fukuyama, who runs a convenience store and will mark her 50th wedding anniversary this year, toasted her hands on an electric heater in the front of the store and declared that a woman would be wrong to get angry if her husband had an affair.
"It's never just one side that's at fault," Mrs. Fukuyama said sternly. "Maybe the husband had an affair because his wife wasn't so hot herself. So she should look at her own faults."
Mrs. Fukuyama's daughter came to her a few years ago, suspecting that her husband was having an affair and asking what to do.
"I told her, 'Once you left this house, you can only come back if you divorce; if you're not prepared to get a divorce, then you'd better be patient,' " Mrs. Fukuyama recalled. "And so she was patient. And then she got pregnant and had a kid, and now they're close again."
The word that Mrs. Fukuyama used for patience is "gaman," a term that comes up whenever marriage is discussed in Japan. It means toughing it out, enduring hardship, and many Japanese regard gaman with pride as a national trait.
Many people complain that younger folks divorce because they do not have enough gaman, and the frequency with which the term is used suggests a rather bleak understanding of marriage.
"I didn't know my husband very well when we married, and afterward we used to get into bitter fights," said Yoshiko Hirowaki, 56, a store owner. "But then we had children, and I got very busy with the kids and with this shop. Time passed."
Now Mrs. Hirowaki has been married 34 years, and she complains about young people who do not stick to their vows.
"In the old days, wives had more gaman," she said. "Now kids just don't have enough gaman."
The durability of the Japanese family is particularly wondrous because couples are, by international standards, exceptionally incompatible.
One survey asked married men and their wives in 37 countries how they felt about politics, sex, religion, ethics and social issues. Japanese couples ranked dead last in compatibility of views, by a huge margin. Indeed, another survey found that if they were doing it over again, only about one-third of Japanese would marry the same person.
Incompatibility might not matter so much, however, because Japanese husbands and wives spend very little time talking to each other.
"I kind of feel there's nothing new to say to her," said Masayuki Ogita, an egg farmer, explaining his reticence.
In a small town like Omiya, couples usually have dinner together, but in Japanese cities there are many "7-11 husbands," so called because they leave at 7 A.M. and return after 11 P.M.
Masahiko Kondo now lives in Omiya, working in the chamber of commerce, but he used to be a salesman in several big cities. He would leave for work each morning at 7, and about four nights a week would go out for after-work drinking or mah-jongg sessions with buddies.
"I only saw my baby on Saturdays or Sundays," said Mr. Kondo, a lanky good-natured man of 37. "But in fact, I really enjoyed that life. It didn't bother me that I never spent time with my kid on weekdays."
Mr. Kondo's wife, Keiko, had her own life, spent with her child and the wives of other workaholic husbands.
"We had birthday parties, but they were with the kids and the mothers," she remembers. "No fathers ever came."
A national survey found that 30 percent of fathers spend less than 15 minutes a day on weekdays talking with or playing with their children. Among eighth graders, 51 percent reported that they never spoke with their fathers on weekdays.
As a result, the figures in Japan for single-parent households can be deceptive. The father is often more a theoretical presence than a homework-helping reality.
Still, younger people sometimes want to see the spouses in daylight, and a result is a gradual change in focus of lives from work to family. Two decades ago, nearly half of young people said in surveys that they wanted their fathers to put priority on work rather than family. Now only one-quarter say that.
 
Social Pressures
Shame Is Keeping Bonds in Place
For those who find themselves desperately unhappy, one source of pressure to keep plugging is shame.
"If you divorce, you lose face in society," said Tatsumi Kinoshita, a tea farmer. "People say, 'His wife escaped.' So folks remain married because they hate to be gossiped about."
Shame is a powerful social sanction in Japan, and it is not just a matter of gossip. Traditionally, many companies were reluctant to promote employees who had divorced or who had major problems at home.
"If you divorce, it weakens your position at work," said Akihiko Kanda, 27, who works in a local government office. "Your bosses won't give you such good ratings, and it'll always be a negative factor."
The idea, Mr. Kanda noted, is that if an employee cannot manage his own life properly, he should not be entrusted with important corporate matters.
Financial sanctions are also a major disincentive for divorce. The mother gets the children in three-quarters of divorces, but most mothers in Japan do not have careers and have few financial resources. Fathers pay child support in only 15 percent of all divorces with children, partly because women often hesitate to go to court to demand payments and partly because men often fail to pay even when the court orders it.
"The main reason for lack of divorce is that women can't support themselves," said Mizuko Kanda, a 51-year-old housewife. "My friends complain about their husbands and say that they'd divorce if they could, but they can't afford to."
The result of these social and economic pressures is clear.
Even in Japan, there are about 24 divorces for every 100 marriages, but that compares with 32 in France, 42 in England, and 55 in the United States.
 
The Outlook
Change Creeps In, Imperiling Family
But society is changing in Japan, and it is an open question whether these changes will undermine the traditional family as they have elsewhere around the globe.
The nuclear family has already largely replaced the extended family in Japan, and shame is eroding as a sanction. Haruko Okumura, for example, runs a kindergarten and speaks openly about her divorce.
"My Mom was uneasy about it, but I never had an inferiority complex about being divorced," said Mrs. Okumura, as dozens of children played in the next room. "And people accepted me easily."
Mrs. Okumura sees evidence of the changes in family patterns every day: fathers are playing more of a role in the kindergarten. At Christmas parties and sports contests, fathers have started to show up along with mothers. And Mrs. Okumura believes that divorce is on the upswing.
"If there's a weakening of the economic and social pressures to stay married," she said, "surely divorce rates will soar."
Already divorce rates are rising, approximately doubling over the last 25 years. But couples are very reluctant to divorce when they have children, and so single-parent households account for exactly the same proportion today as in 1965.
Shinsuke Kawaguchi, a young tea farmer, is one of the men for whom life is changing. Americans are not likely to be impressed by Mr. Kawaguchi's open-mindedness, but he is.
"I take good care of my wife," he said. "I may not say 'I love you,' but I do hold her hand. And I might say, after she makes dinner, 'This tastes good.' "
"Of course," Mr. Kawaguchi quickly added, "I wouldn't say that unless I'd just done something really bad."
Even Mrs. Uemura, the elderly women whose husband used to beat her, said that her husband was treating her better.
"The other day, he tried to pour me a cup of tea," Mrs. Uemura recalled excitedly. "It was a big change. I told all my friends."

Spring Camps Open Without Anderson

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Cincinnati Reds played the Philadelphia Phillies in the first game of their 1970 spring training exhibition schedule, and it was a day Sparky Anderson will not forget.
"It was my first one," Anderson recalled the other day. "I was walking around before the game -- I always walked around in those days; I was always walkative -- and I wound up in left field. Johnny Bench was out there and he said, 'Are you nervous?' I said yeah. That was the first game I actually was going to manage. He said: 'Don't be nervous. Just relax and do what you would normally do.' You remember that." 
 Twenty-six years and 4,028 games, 2,194 victories, 5 pennants and 3 World Series championships later, Sparky Anderson has no role this spring. When the first teams hold their first pitcher-and-catcher workouts Thursday, the venerable former manager will be in California, at home in Thousand Oaks or in the northern part of the state seeing his 14th grandchild for the first time.
"It's the first time in 43 years," he said of his absence from spring training. "I know it's not going to be easy. With the guys up here, I shrug it off and say it's no problem, but I have to be honest. It's going to be hard."
Anderson's annual spring trips began in 1953, his first year as a minor league player. When he was between managing jobs in the spring of 1979, he was in Florida in a nonuniform capacity working on a special for a Los Angeles television station. And last year he stayed away from replacement spring training but was there when the real players showed up after their strike.
But now he has left baseball, resigning from his job with the Detroit Tigers after 17 years and, at the age of nearly 62, attracting no invitations to manage anyone else. His unemployed status has left him with little desire to head to Florida or Arizona and just hang around.
"As of now, I have no urge to go," he said. "But come when it opens, I might. I really don't know. That's going to be a good test for me. That will be one test that will be a hard one and then when opening day comes and the season starts for real. That will be extremely hard. I'm not kidding myself. I'm going to try to stay real busy around those times so I won't get real antsy, but I will anyway. You can't do something for so long and then all of a sudden not do it."
Spring training produces memories for anyone in baseball, and the longer one is around it, the more memories he has. In Anderson's case, spring was the time he would spot the players he would subsequently tout as the next Hall of Famer.
Not all spring memories are pleasant, though. Anderson recalled the day in 1975 he took a team of unknown players to Daytona Beach, Fla., for a game with Montreal, leaving Bench, Pete Rose, Joe Morgan, Dave Concepcion, Tony Perez, George Foster and Ken Griffey in Tampa.
"I had a habit early in my career not to take good ballplayers on the road," Anderson said. "I always wanted to leave my good players at home because they would get more work. That's not right, but I admit I did it. We went over there to play the Expos, and the biggest name I had with me was Darrel Chaney. The rest nobody knew from Adam."
Before Anderson got home, John McHale, the Expos' president, called Bob Howsam, his Reds counterpart.
"John was unhappy and he had every reason to be," Anderson said. "Bob was unhappy and that bothered me because when he's unhappy he lets you know. That ended that. As the years went on, I think I took better clubs on the road than anybody."
The road trips are over for Anderson but not his passion for bas'ball.
"I follow it every day and I'm going to follow it through spring training and during the season," he said. "I'll watch the Dodgers and the Angels and catch cable games. But no one has called about any jobs. I hope they know I won't do any scouting. If I'm going to run around the country, it's going to be managing, not sitting in a hotel room somewhere waiting to scout."
Anderson wi'l be at home, where his wife, Carol, is not accustomed to having him.
"Right now everything's fine," he said. "This is just like a normal winter. But come 10 days from now, we'll start changing. That will be the true test. She's used to doing her things. I try to stay out of her way. She's always been the one to baby me when things are rough. She doesn't need that anymore. I'll have to do this myself. I'll get through it. It's not like the world's coming to an end. But I'll be honest. I'll miss it."
 
 
 
Roller-Coaster Roster Ride
 On Jan. 18, the Florida Marlins put Aaron Small on waivers. On Jan. 23, the Seattle Mariners claimed him. On Jan. 24, the Mariners put Small on waivers. On Jan. 29, the Oakland Athletics claimed him. On Jan. 30, Small rested.
"I was on a roller coaster the whole week," Small, a 24-year-old pitcher, said. "I didn't know what was going on. The funny thing is, I was with Toronto for six and a half years, then four teams in nine months."
Except for a week with the Blue Jays in 1994 and a month with the Marlins last season, Small has spent his seven-year professional career in the minor leagues. He pitched once for the Blue Jays, working two innings in a relief against the Yankees, and relieved seven times for the Marlins last September, gaining a victory and compiling a 1.42 earned run average in six and one-third innings.
"We needed a roster spot," Dave Dombrowski, the Marlins' general manager, said in explaining the decision to seek waivers on the right-hander. "As much as we like Aaron, the chances of his making the team in the spring weren't good. We figured we'd be asking waivers at some point so we might as well do it now."
The Mariners claimed Small because they liked him, but they had a roster problem, too.
"We would like to have had him in our system," General Manager Woody Woodward said. "If a spot had cleared, we would have put him right on the 40-man roster. If it didn't clear, we would ask waivers and if no one claimed him, we would outright him and send him to Triple-A. Sometimes you get him through that way."
Because the Athletics finished lower than the Mariners, they could have had Small by claiming him the first time around. Given a second chance, they plucked him off the waiver wire.
"Some things had transpired between the first and second waiver requests," Sandy Alderson, the Oakland general manager, said. "We had a change in our circumstances, and we took a second look."
Dave Stewart, an assistant to Alderson, contributed to that second look, having played with Small in the Toronto organization.
"I like him as a person, first of all," Stewart, the recently retired pitcher, said. "And I think he has a chance to be an outstanding pitcher. He can be a starter or a reliever. He has a real good chance to pitch for us this year."
When Small checked his telephone messages Jan. 29, he found one from Larry Beinfest of the Mariners and another from Billy Beane of the Athletics.
"I called Larry and he said good luck," Small related. "I called Billy Beane and he told me they had claimed me. I told Larry, I was with you guys for six days and I didn't meet anyone. It was a weird week for me. But I'm excited about it now, now that I can concentrate on what team I'm going to be with."
 
 
 
Winfield's Union Ties
 When he announced his retirement from a 23-year, six-team career last week, Dave Winfield was asked which team's cap he would wear when he was elected to the Hall of Fame. He didn't answer, but the banner that hung on the wall behind him provided an idea.
It was the banner of the Major League Baseball Players Association, the players' union, which Winfield wanted to salute on his way out. That's because Winfield always was a strong supporter of the union and someone who understood why he was able to sign, in December 1980, a contract that would pay him $18,316,602 in the next 10 years, a princely sum for the time.
Union officials always have been fond of Winfield. Marvin Miller, the union's first director, saluted him for his unswerving support of the strike in 1981 even though he had the security of a 10-year contract and the rights the players were fighting for would not affect him.
And there was the recent eight-month strike that threatened to end Winfield's career prematurely. Yet he was out front during that one, too.
Perhaps, then, it would be fitting for the cap on Winfield's Cooperstown plaque not to have "NY" or a Blue Jay on it but to say "MLBPA."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: ON THE TRAIL;
In Political Quest, Forbes Runs in Shadow of Father

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
There are moments during the indignities of his Presidential campaign when Steve Forbes wonders what "Pop" would have thought of it all.
Last week alone, father and son would have found plenty to talk about: Senator Phil Gramm ridiculed Mr. Forbes for raising "polo ponies" on his farm; three governors attacked him in Washington, and what his headquarters called a Christian right "smear campaign" accused him of having a Robert Mapplethorpe print on his yacht. (A seascape, not homoerotic art, the candidate shot back.) 
 Speaking of his father, Malcolm, as his 22-year-old campaign bus bounced across the frozen tundra of Iowa from Fort Dodge to Des Moines, Steve Forbes said, "I think he'd be bemused by the intensity of the reaction."
Mr. Forbes says he is running for President because Jack Kemp would not, and to sell America on his flat tax.
But this explanation does not entirely satisfy even his friends, who remain mystified about why a 48-year-old magazine scion with no elective experience would get up one morning to announce that he will spend whatever it takes, about $16.5 million so far, of his inherited fortune to live in the White House.
Mr. Forbes says he has not reached some sort of personal watershed -- "I don't believe in midlife crises," he asserts -- so speculation on at least part of his motives inevitably turns to the specter of his late father, the eccentric and flamboyant publisher whom by all accounts the shy, awkward Steve adored.
Some friends see Mr. Forbes's campaign as an attempt to emerge finally from the shadow of his father, something the candidate rejects.
"Believe me, there are other ways of making a mark for oneself without the risks, the aggravation, the investment, the wear and tear on family life and the meat-grinding process of a Presidential campaign," he said.
In fact, what is far more striking are the parallels in the lives of the two men. Like his eldest son and chosen heir, Malcolm Forbes did not come into his own as a powerful figure at Forbes magazine until he was in his 40's, when he took over after his brother died. Like his son, Malcolm Forbes wanted to be President, and in pursuit of that goal ran twice unsuccessfully -- with young Steve often at his side -- for Governor of New Jersey.
"I came to the conclusion there was no way I could consciously imitate this particular individual," Steve Forbes said. "And it would be futile to do so. He was unique. It's like in athletics. You know, great athletes -- they retire the number. With my father, I figure they retired the shoes. Don't try to fill them. Get your own shoes."
 
Father's Political Path Was an Early Influence
Born Malcolm Stevenson Forbes Jr., Steve was raised in the old-monied hillsides of Somerset County, N.J., moderate Republican fox-hunting land, where the neighbors ran for Congress and served in the Cabinet. Christine Todd, Mr. Forbes's childhood friend from the Far Hills Country Day school, would grow up to become Governor Whitman. Steve Forbes joined the club at 6, when he ran doorbells and bumped along in the converted milk truck that served as the campaign bus in his father's gubernatorial race.
Malcolm Forbes was then a state senator, and he lost in a close 1953 Republican primary to a candidate backed by the powerful New Jersey Republican organization -- an "outsider" position like the one his son is assuming now.
When Malcolm Forbes was trounced by the Governor, a Democrat, in the general election of 1957, he gave up politics for the family business. His son went off to the Brooks School in North Andover, Mass., then on to Princeton, Malcolm Forbes's alma mater. Six months after graduation, in 1971, he joined Forbes as a researcher and began working his way up as the preselected heir.
By this time, Malcolm Forbes was busy promoting his magazine as the product of a happy multimillionaire who ballooned, yachted, motorcycled and collected Faberge eggs. Aside from his popular "Fact and Comment" column, he only occasionally meddled in the editorial content.
Fortune magazine asserted in its Feb. 5 issue that under the younger Mr. Forbes, who now has the title of editor in chief, writers have seen tough articles about companies that advertise in Forbes changed from negative to positive assessments. Mr. Forbes denied that.
In contrast with his father, Steve Forbes always loved policy, and he became enamored of a small group of supply-side economists in his early days at Forbes. Jude Wanniski, a supply-sider who helped push Mr. Forbes into the Presidential race, remembers first seeing him at a 1977 supply-side gathering at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. "Steve was there on the periphery, taking notes," Mr. Wanniski said.
After Malcolm Forbes died suddenly in 1990, Mr. Forbes took over the magazine as well as the media company of Forbes Inc., a transfer of power that gave him 51 percent of the voting stock. His younger siblings, three brothers and a sister, had accepted the decision years before. Despite of -- or because of -- his anointment, the new king among princes characterized this period as one of great strain. "That's when everyone was looking, 'Can he do it?' " Mr. Forbes said.
Mr. Forbes had to contend at the same time with the first published reports in the gay press of his father's homosexuality. His parents were divorced in 1985, and friends say Mr. Forbes did not discuss his father's life with them. But certainly in the last five years of his life, Malcolm Forbes became increasingly indiscreet, and he was seen regularly roaring up on his motorcycle in tight black leather to Manhattan nightclubs and, according to current and former workers at Forbes, pursuing some of his young male employees.
"I've always dealt with fact and not rumor," Steve Forbes said. "And if anyone had brought facts that would have warranted a confrontation with my father, I'd have confronted him. Since no one did, I never did."
Asked how the behavior of his most important male role model affected Mr. Forbes's thinking about his father and his own life, Mr. Forbes responded with a remark that seemed to have been prepared a long time ago.
"I think you have to realize that compassion is not approval," Mr. Forbes said carefully, echoing the phrase he had used at an earlier campaign stop to explain his opposition to same-sex marriage.
Did he ever talk to his father about his behavior in the last years of his life? "No," said Mr. Forbes, in a barely audible voice.
 
Opponents' Tactics Take Toll on Forbes
Bill Dal Col, Mr. Forbes's campaign manager, warned his candidate months ago that his opponents would use his father against him. It seems to be working. Although polls show Mr. Forbes leading in New Hampshire, he is in a close race for second in Iowa and is rapidly losing ground among religious conservatives, according to his own and independent polls.
On Friday, Mr. Forbes said an anonymous telephone campaign was being waged against him in Iowa, with callers telling voters that Mr. Forbes supports taxpayer-financed abortions and special rights for homosexuals. Both are untrue, Mr. Forbes said. He supports privately financed abortions, but not in the late stages of pregnancy, and the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for homosexuals in the military.
None of this was part of New Jersey politics in the relatively genteel 1950's. "It's part of the hazing of the American political system," he said.
Mr. Forbes neglected to say that he is engaging in what some political veterans are calling the most negative advertising campaign in primary history, attacking Senator Bob Dole, as well as Mr. Gramm and former Gov. Lamar Alexander, who are behind him in the polls.
Indeed, when Mr. Forbes was asked whether he really had a burning desire to be President, he used the opportunity to take another punch at his rivals.
"Well, it's not the situation where, say, a Phil Gramm. ..." he said, pausing momentarily. "Can this go off the record?" Getting no agreement, Mr. Forbes paused again, then made a decision to continue.
"I think others have spent their whole lives planning to be President," said the candidate from horse country, where one does not display excessive ambition, even if one has spent about $16.5 million.
"And therefore I think they have perhaps an unhealthy desire for it. Yes, you have to desire it. You obviously work hard at it. But you have to put it in perspective, that if it doesn't work out, so be it. I don't think those others are of a mind to say, so be it. No, in terms of ambition, for them it's an obsession."
Mr. Forbes continued: "I have the ambition. And I think I'm going to do a better job as President, because I know what I want to do when I get there. It's not to be, it's to do. With too many others, public life is to be."
Mr. Forbes, who is married with five daughters, is an Episcopalian, and he said he was religious enough to think that his father knows he is running for President.
"I'm sure he does," he said. "And I'm sure I'll get an earful some day when I go up and join him."

HEADLINE: Russia Wants No Return of Cold War, Official Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Yevgeny M. Primakov, the new Russian Foreign Minister, said today that Russia continued to desire a close working relationship with the United States and had no intention of trying to resurrect the Soviet Union.
Mr. Primakov, who spoke after two days of meetings here with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, also said Russia would not put into effect any new oil deal with Iraq until the United Nations lifted sanctions against it. 
 Mr. Primakov, 66, took over in January as Foreign Minister after Andrei V. Kozyrev, a liberal Westernizer, was fired. It was Mr. Primakov's first trip to the West since his appointment, after extensive visits to the former Soviet republics of Tajikistan, Belarus and Ukraine.
"I'd say we're off to a good start," Mr. Christopher said. Senior American officials said these early, wide-ranging discussions between two men who barely knew one another had been conducted in a conciliatory and friendly atmosphere, despite serious differences on issues like the planned eastward expansion of NATO and the Russian sale of nuclear reactors to Iran.
American officials expressed relief at Mr. Primakov's pragmatism, skill and evident preparation. They said President Boris N. Yeltsin had no desire for instability in the American relationship before Russian presidential elections in June. But the tone was a far cry from the warm talk of alliances, friendship and partnership that used to surround meetings with Mr. Kozyrev.
Mr. Christopher had dinner with Mr. Primakov on Friday night as well as six and a half hours of talks with him. Mr. Christopher said he was "pleasantly surprised" by "the attitudes of openness he brought, and the willingness to recognize differences and manage them." Mr. Primakov "stressed that the cold war is over" and that neither he nor any of his colleagues wanted it back, Mr. Christopher said.
For his part, Mr. Primakov said: "It was very fruitful. As you Americans like to say, it was a very businesslike meeting. The relationship between our two countries is of the first priority." He said there was "no basis to consider that Russian-American relations are in a crisis."
Mr. Primakov is an English- and Arabic-speaking Middle East expert who served in the Soviet Politburo and most recently ran Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, the international side of the old K.G.B.
He is regarded as a better representative of the tough, more nationalistic tone in Russian foreign policy that Mr. Yeltsin began to articulate after the strong showing of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky in the December 1993 parliamentary elections.
Two years later, Mr. Yeltsin is further weakened by the quagmire in separatist Chechnya and his own unhealthy heart muscle. With the presidential election drawing near, Mr. Yeltsin is trying to co-opt a new Parliament dominated by Communists and nationalists.
Mr. Yeltsin has fired the most prominent liberals in his Cabinet. American officials insist that the essence of Russian-American relations has not changed, and that as Mr. Christopher said today, there are more areas of agreement than disagreement.
But Mr. Primakov insisted today on "equality" in the relationship, an old cold war complaint about American arrogance, saying, "We want to eliminate from our international life the uncomfortable consequences of the cold war, which we can still feel from time to time."
The two men agreed, at Mr. Christopher's suggestion, on a rough set of principles to govern their relations, Mr. Primakov said. They agreed to try not to surprise each other and to consult early and often, one of Mr. Primakov's big concerns, officials said.
As an example, American officials said, the American Middle East negotiator, Dennis Ross, will go to Moscow to brief Russian officials on the Syrian-Israeli peace talks. Russia is, after all, co-chairman of the Madrid peace conference under which the talks are being held. Similar talks on other regional problems will take place more regularly than before.
The two sides also agreed to work to carry out agreements already reached, including a new Russian effort to ratify the Start II strategic arms reduction treaty, signed three years ago but just approved by the American Senate. It will be a hard sell in the new Russian legislature, officials said Mr. Primakov had told Mr. Christopher, but the Russian Defense Ministry supports the treaty.
And they agreed to try to manage differences they could not resolve, so that they could continue to work together in areas like peacekeeping in Bosnia or fighting international terrorism and drug trafficking.
The prime difference between the two countries is NATO expansion, which Mr. Christopher said would proceed in a "long-term process," emphasizing that NATO would not expand this year. American officials said Mr. Primakov echoed Mr. Yeltsin's longstanding opposition to that expansion, but did not threaten any steps like putting short-range nuclear missiles into Belarus, as some Russian Defense Ministry officials have suggested.
Mr. Christopher tried to encourage Russia to continue military cooperation with NATO, as in Bosnia, where Russian peacekeeping troops take part in a NATO-commanded operation, and in NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace program.
On the eve of the meetings with Mr. Primakov, Mr. Christopher met here with the Ukrainian President, Leonid Kuchma, and announced a summit meeting between President Clinton and Mr. Kuchma in Washington on Feb. 21. As Russia has moved toward more nationalism, American officials have emphasized the importance of a free and independent Ukraine.
While Mr. Primakov has emphasized strengthening Russia's relations with its former Soviet brothers, he said today: "No one is for the re-establishment of the Soviet Union -- it cannot be and will not be. And there is no turning away from the sovereignty the various republics have established."
But Mr. Primakov also discussed with Mr. Christopher some problem areas of the Commonwealth of Independent States, including Georgia, the separatist Azerbaijan region of Nagorno-Karabakh and especially Tajikistan, where the Russian-backed Government is under pressure from a renewed, Afghan-backed Islamic rebellion.
Asked whether Mr. Primakov had discussed with the Americans whether more Russian troops would soon be arriving in Tajikistan, a senior official said, "He wasn't that explicit." But an official said that the discussion of Tajikistan had been longer than the one on Chechnya, in which Mr. Christopher repeated the American position that a political solution is vital and a military one impossible.
On Iraq, Mr. Primakov assured Mr. Christopher that a reported $10 billion agreement to help the Iraqi oil industry would not go into effect until international sanctions against Baghdad were completely lifted, American officials said. Mr. Primakov said openly that Russia was largely interested in getting back some of the $7 billion owed to it by Iraq.
And on Iran, Mr. Primakov repeated the Russian position that its sale of nuclear reactors to Teheran would not help that Government produce nuclear weapons. The United States opposes the sale.
Officials said Mr. Primakov was impressive in his preparation and level of detail on various issues and did not glance over some topics as Mr. Kozyrev had been prone to do. "Christopher and Primakov are of the same generation," one American official said. "They were pragmatic and comfortable together."
Mr. Christopher and Mr. Primakov will meet again in Moscow around March 18, and then again around April 18, when President Clinton goes to Moscow for a meeting on nuclear safety and a summit session with Mr. Yeltsin.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P.'s Grand New Struggle

 BODY:
Heavy, heavy, heavy is the mantle of inevitability. Just ask poor Bob Dole, the latest victim of the voters' quadrennial struggle to escape an arranged marriage. Inevitability panic is often associated with the Democrats, but Republicans are not immune. Witness the serial levitations from the Republican pack. First Steve Forbes, a trust-fund poster boy, surfs along as the lets-lower-my-taxes-even-if-we-have-to-raise-yours candidate. Then the Louisiana caucuses coughed up Pat Buchanan as the latest and most unlikely in a long line of Huey Long reincarnations. Now Lamar Alexander, who brags that he is less tired than Mr. Dole and less naive than Mr. Forbes, is moving up in Iowa.
Some media critics want journalists and voters to ignore the horse race, a mindless instruction in light of the fact that this particular race is intertwined with an important development in Republican politics. A Los Angeles Times headline, "G.O.P. Class Warfare Erupts as Candidates Assail Forbes," was on the money, so to speak. 
 The battle was triggered by a slowly dawning awareness of what the flat tax really means beyond being a handy way for the Republicans to hand the fall election to President Clinton. It would save millions of dollars for Mr. Forbes and other holders of inherited wealth in capital gains and estate taxes for decades to come.
That aspect of this "truly nutty idea," to use Mr. Alexander's words, has opened up the Republicans' most divisive intramural issue -- the question of whether the party is going to serve the economic interests of the old guard that shaped its traditional policies or the middle-class voters who gave it the White House in the 80's and control of Congress in 1994. Huey (the Kingfish) Buchanan placed his bet in Louisiana by promoting his new "conservatism with a heart." He is championing the Republican middle managers who are getting laid off against another Republican faction, the downsizers who are fattening quarterly earnings at the expense of career employees.
Just as the Democrats have been riven at times by racial and union issues, the Republicans could face powerful internal strains over income. They like to argue that the Democrats are the party of class warfare, but it is Phil Gramm who has been calling Mr. Forbes "Richie Rich." Both Mr. Gramm and Newt Gingrich have criticized Mr. Forbes for wanting to take a free ride on investment income while taxing wages and salaries through payroll deductions. Mr. Dole has said that he cannot favor a plan that takes away the home mortgage exemption and loads a $200 billion deficit increase on the backs of wage earners.
Mr. Forbes's policy guru, Jude Wanniski, has recognized the threat in this line of attack and is circulating a memo arguing that Mr. Forbes is the true populist because he wants everyone to get rich. He makes a strained argument that "Forbes is not Old Wealth" since his grandfather started the fortune. It is Bob Dole, according to Mr. Wanniski, who serves the class at the top of the pyramid and is "biased toward preserving and protecting its wealth."
If the Forbes camp is going to play the politics of resentment against Mr. Dole, it had better be careful. Mr. Dole is the Mozart of resentment. Nobody does it better, and for all the rocks in his road lately, Mr. Dole has caught an unexpected break. Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Alexander are both positioned to grab shares of the anti-Dole vote that seemed to be flowing in a bloc to Mr. Forbes.
In any event, recent history shows that fractious primary voters may eventually learn to tolerate an old-shoe candidate. Think of all the Democrats who sighed and accepted the fact that Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis were as good as it was going to get.
The whole business will play out fairly quickly now. So in the coming weeks, disregard all those urgings to ignore the horse race. This one has meaning enough for the direction of the country, the shape of the Republican Party and Bill Clinton's hopes of facing a battered candidate and a squabbling party. Anyway, it is a dandy show.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 12, 1996, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the candidate Steve Forbes in some copies misattributed a reference to him as "Richie Rich." The comment was made by Senator Phil Gramm, not Pat Buchanan.

HEADLINE: O'Rourke's Raise Draws Much Ire

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
LATE last year, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke convinced county legislators and many constituents that dramatic measures must be taken to downsize government. That meant privatizing some county services, eliminating 800 jobs, consolidating departments and reducing travel, meal and car expenses. Mr. O'Rourke's goal: a saving of $2.6 million.
But 12 days ago, the County Executive proposed a 19.5 percent pay raise for himself and County Clerk Leonard N. Spano, including in his proposal retroactive paychecks of totaling nearly $50,000 for the two officials. 
 Now the complaints from outraged taxpayers are being heard loud and clear on the eighth floor of the County Office Building here, especially in the 17 offices of the county legislators.
The callers "feel the timing is bad," said George Oros, a Republican from Cortlandt and Chairman of the Board of Legislators. "That kind of a pay hike is a very difficult sell right now."
One worker who lost her $47,000-a-year job at Woodfield Cottage, the youth detention center in Valhalla, which was privatized, called Mr. O'Rourke's proposal "a slap in the face."
"How could he do this after all we went through?" said Mary C. Bryant, a member of the Westchester County Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 12,000 county workers. "Those of us who were laid off are making do on unemployment, and he's asking for all that money."
The proposal would raise Mr. O'Rourke's salary by $23,250 to $142,335, which is more than Gov. George E. Pataki earns. It would also surpass the salary of other county executives in the New York City area, some of whose jurisdictions have larger populations.
Although the County Executive has offered no public explanation for his unpopular proposal, he did send Deputy County Executive Neil J. DeLuca to the Board's Budget and Appropriations Committee early last week with a revised plan.
Mr. DeLuca recommended a 7.5 percent raise over two years for the two top elected officials -- the same percentage that was approved for the teamsters union and the Civil Service Employees Association for 1994 and 1995. Neither the unions nor Mr. O'Rourke or Mr. Spano would receive raises this year.
Marc Moran, a spokesman for Mr. O'Rourke, said that when an organization downsizes, pay raises are often subject to criticism.
"But downsizing in this case has to do with how the business of government is changing at the end of the 20th century, when in many cases we're working with a model that dates back to the 19th century," Mr. Moran said. "And that's a separate issue from what is reasonable compensation for the work force. Westchester has to remain competitive in order to attract the right people to jobs."
Mr. O'Rourke, who has not received a raise since 1990, had asked the Board of Legislators late last month to make his raise, and those of 2 other elected officials and 240 commissioners and managers, retroactive to 1994.
Mr. O'Rourke's back pay, under the proposal, would have come to $26,136. The County Clerk would have earned $118,345 under the plan, up $19,330 from his current salary. His retroactive check would have come to $21,792.
Other managers and commissioners would receive raises of 7.5 percent. The original pay plan and the amended version are both under attack by Democrats and Mr. O'Rourke's fellow Republicans on the Board and from members of taxpayer groups that had supported the County Executive's moves to downsize. Critics say pay hikes should not benefit elected officials during their current terms of office.
Mr. Spano, who said he learned of the pay-raise proposal from a newspaper story when he returned from vacation, said he was against the plan.
A County Legislator for 22 years and the chairman of the Budget Committee for more than half of that time, he suggested that raises for the two top elected officials in the county be built in on a regular basis to avoid "playing catch-up" every few years.
Katherine S. Carsky, a Republican from Greenburgh, said she shared the sentiments of Republican and Democratic colleagues alike. "Let's just say we agree that Mr. O'Rourke's timing is not good."
But some political observers like Michael Edelman, a lawyer and Republican consultant, said that on the basis of numbers alone and years without a raise, Mr. O'Rourke was not wrong to ask for an increase in his salary.
"But it's a different question as to whether it was a politically bright thing to do," said Mr. Edelman, who practices law in White Plains. "You can't be austere when it comes to county employees and not be austere when applying it to yourself."
Many observers have questioned why Mr. O'Rourke -- County Executive for 13 years and widely considered an astute politician -- would have made such a politically unpopular move.
The County Executive recently put to rest widespread speculation that he would be stepping down from his current post to accept a judgeship by announcing that he would not only complete his current term but possibly seek a seventh.
That announcement followed an abrupt and unexpected shift in the political lineup of the newly elected Board of Legislators when six Democrats, one Conservative and three dissident Republicans took power and elected Mr. Oros Chairman over Mrs. Carsky, who was the county Republican Party's choice.
Following that change in the Legislature, Republican leaders were said to be worried that if Mr. O'Rourke resigned before the end of his term, the coalition might name a successor not to their liking.
No one in Mr. O'Rourke's office would offer an explanation for the County Executive's decision to ask for a pay increase now. Whatever the reason, Mr. Edelman said, Mr. O'Rourke's salary proposal "did not play well to the public."
Meanwhile, Paul J. Noto, a Republican Legislator from Mamaroneck who called the proposal "a little generous," said that the County Executive's salary has historically been tied to management raises and union contracts and that some commissioners are earning more than Mr. O'Rourke.
Dr. Mark Rapoport, Westchester's Health Commissioner, and Millard J. Hyland, the Medical Examiner and Commissioner of Laboratories and Research, each earn $123,005. Edward Stolzenberg, the Hospitals Commissioner, earns $200,000. Joseph Hankin, president of Westchester Community College, earns $124,130 plus a $15,000-a-year housing allowance.
And the position of Deputy Hospitals Commissioner, which is unfilled, commands a salary of $135,000.
Although the County Charter says that the County Executive and County Clerk's salaries should be tied to the pay scale of managers, commissioners and other high-level officials, Mr. DeLuca recommended to the Board last week that that process be changed and a flat rate agreed upon for the future.
The co-chairman of the Budget Committee, Richard G. Wishnie, a Democrat from Briarcliff Manor, agreed with the principle of a flat rate but opposed a pay raise now.
"This is not the time to increase the County Executive's salary," Mr. Wishnie said. "No matter how good a job he is doing, you run for office knowing what the pay scale is. Next term may be a different story."
Mr. Wishnie suggested that a study of comparative salaries be conducted to determine the future pay for Westchester's chief executive.
Mr. O'Rourke currently earns $119,085 a year in a county with a population of 890,000 people.
Robert J. Gaffney earns $107,602 as County Executive in Suffolk County, whose population is 1.35 million. Mr. Gaffney's salary increases are tied by law to the cost of living, and this year he received a raise of 1.77 percent.
In Nassau County, where 1.3 million people live, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta earns $109,394. His salary was recently raised by 4.75 percent, the same amount received by unionized employees. Like Mr. O'Rourke, the Suffolk County Executive had not had an increase since 1990.
In Rockland County, with a population of 275,000, C. Scott Vanderhoef earns $97,830. His last raise, $2,500, was in 1995. Mr. Vanderhoef, who also earns less than some of his commissioners and some local police chiefs, said such disparities in salaries needed to be looked at.
"But any time an elected official tries to raise his salary for any reason, he will be subject to criticism," he said.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani earns $165,000. And Gov. George E. Pataki earns $130,000.

HEADLINE: Aboard An Extended Shoreline East

BYLINE: By PENNY PARSEKIAN 

 BODY:
SHORELINE commuters from the New London area now have an option to battling traffic on Interstate 95. The Department of Transportation has extended the Shoreline East commuter rail service, which makes stops between New Haven and Old Saybrook, to New London.
This is the first new rail service in the state since Shoreline East was inaugurated in May 1990 and represents a reversal for the current administration. In a budget trimming effort last February, Gov. John G. Rowland recommended terminating the Shoreline service entirely. 
 Harry P. Harris, Deputy Commissioner of Transportation, explained that the new service is a two-year pilot project "to do what we can to reduce the number of cars on I-95, which is heavily congested," particularly across the Quinnipiac bridge. A $250,000 advertising and marketing campaign is being aimed at new riders, Mr. Harris said. Few people rode the first train out of New London on Feb. 1, and only about 20 were on later trains, according to Robert Levy, marketing director of Rideworks, a nonprofit organization that handles customer service for Shoreline East. "But there's a lot of interest," he said, citing the nearly 400 requests for free passes received as of last week. The free passes for February are in addition to free parking arranged by the Department of Transportation and the City of New London.
Representative Robert R. Simmons, a Republican from Stonington who has introduced legislation to bolster the commuter service, believes this is a first step in the right direction.
"I've always been concerned that Shoreline East should not terminate in a lightly populated area west of the Connecticut River," Mr. Simmons said, referring to Old Saybrook. But scheduling remains a concern. The morning trains depart from Union Station at 5:28 and 6:28 and arrive in New Haven at 6:38 and 7:38. Departures from New Haven are at 5:05 and 6:10 P.M., arriving in New London at 6:15 and 7:20 P.M. Mr. Simmons described the morning schedule as "adverse"; in short, it's too early.
Bruce Fellman, who lives in North Stonington and works in New Haven, fits the profile Mr. Simmons is aiming at. Mr. Fellman said he tried driving the 135-mile round trip and has used car pools. Now he boards the train in Westbrook. "It sometimes adds a half hour to my commute," he said, "but it's useful time. I come home and I'm not a zombie, and I get to work and I'm not jittery."
Even though New London is closer to home than Westbrook he says he is not inclined to use the new service. "It's way earlier than I need to be in," he said. "It doesn't seem designed to attract many riders. If they got the timing right, I'd be willing." The D.O.T.'s decision to run the early trains is based on ridership patterns and expenditures, said Lawrence Forbes, rail administrator of the department's Bureau of Public Transportation. "The 7:30 A.M. arrival time in New Haven is the heaviest ridership," Mr. Forbes said. "Thirty percent continue west of New Haven" on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
"Those were the only times we could do without using additional equipment," he added. "It is a cost-effective way to provide a limited extension of the service."
Mr. Forbes said the project would add between $124,000 and $150,000 to operating costs under the current agreement with Amtrak, which runs Shoreline East. The agreement is now under negotiation.
Mr. Forbes said that running more trains would be possible, because the state has new cars on order, but operating costs, maintenance and track usage fees would add about $1.5 million. "Hopefully the renegotiations will bring costs down so we could do it," he said.
More trains might attract riders like Mr. Fellman, who said his cost calculations for taking the new service came out favorably. He said he added the increase in fare and parking costs and still came up with a savings by taking the train from New London. A one-way fare between New London and New Haven is $7.25, a 10-trip ticket costs $65 and the monthly fare is $151. A monthly ticket for connecting bus service in New Haven costs $5.
Unlike Mr. Fellman, the City of New London is not hedging about the service. At a November meeting of a state task force to gather information on rail service, Peter Gillespie, a city planner, listed new tourist attractions in the region including the Thames River Heritage Park, expected to draw 250,000 visitors; an enlarged Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino resort complex, the planned Mohegan Sun Resort, as well as the Mystic Seaport Museum and Mystic Marine Life Aquarium. He said that a million visitors now pass through New London annually and existing roads cannot accommodate the anticipated growth.
Philip J. Slack 3d, executive director of Oceanquest, a marine sciences camp and oceanography museum slated to open this year, testified that his organization projected 375,000 visitors (including 5,000 students the first year). He said he thought expanded rail service was needed to keep road traffic moving.
Among the critics of the new service are boaters, who see each new train run limiting their passage to upstream docks. At a Jan. 3 meeting of the Essex-based Connecticut Marine Trades Association, members questioned the legality of extending the service until the economic impact report, being conducted in conjunction with Amtrak's electrification of the northeast corridor, is completed. Between Old Saybrook and New London there are three movable railroad bridges, at the Connecticut River, at the Niantic River and at Shaw's Cove in New London.
But Mr. Forbes sees a minimal impact resulting from these particular four trains a day. "I don't see that we're going to inhibit boaters" during the early morning runs Monday through Friday, he said, adding that the bridges are open only five to seven minutes at a time. "There are things we could do if it hampers anyone," he said. "If we were increasing trains on weekends or holidays, that would be another story."
There are also critics who contend any addition to the service is simply increasing a large subsidy to serve a small constituency of commuters. Shoreline East costs about $5.5 million a year to operate and carries about 300,000 riders. But transportation officials say costs should not be examined in a vacuum. "The cost of adding a lane to I-95 is in the $8 billion range," Deputy Commissioner Harris said. "We have exceeded the original design capacity of I-95. At peak hours, the road is a hair short of gridlock. In 2010, peak hours will be 12 hours a day. You can improve road capacity on a limited basis, but the bottom line is alternatives have got to be the way to go: rail, bus, car or van pooling. So we are committed to getting people onto rail systems. We have to put the system in place and then offer incentives."
Cost and usage constraints have led to unusual arrangements in some areas of the country, said Davis Dure, a consultant with LS Transit Systems Inc. in Bloomfield, N.J. "To expand the flexibility, some commuter agencies have cut a deal with Amtrak to honor commutation tickets," Mr. Dure said. "A midday getaway train, for example, adds to the marketability of the service." Currently there are 18 Amtrak trains a day connecting New London and New Haven.
"Connecticut could reimburse Amtrak," Mr. Dure said. "Virginia Rail Express, a new commuter operation that runs between Washington, Manassas and Fredericksburg, has this arrangement. They do it on the West Coast, too, where Amtrak runs Los Angeles Metro Link trains."
Deputy Commissioner Harris says the expansion of Shoreline East is one of several rail options the state is considering.
"There is a study under way in the Legislature to look at extending service from New Haven to Hartford," he said. A study a few years ago found such a line would most likely generate considerable traffic, but also a sizable operating deficit, he said. "Even if we could absorb the capital cost, we have no room to absorb the operating deficit," Mr. Harris said. "The cost of starting a new system is considerably more than extending an existing one."
Representative Simmons sees rail as playing a larger role in the state's future.
"A major initiative is coming out of southeastern Connecticut, and roads can't handle it," he said. Commuter rail service is "going to be a potential economic boon to New London, because it's going to draw commuters into downtown. Over time, they may discover they can pick up tourism by running trains over the weekend."
"Connecticut is a small state," he said. "If you look at the total acreage of land devoted to roads, we don't have the acreage to meet these growing needs. We have to better utilize the rail infrastructure that we already have."

HEADLINE: ART;
Eclectic Exhibition by Neighbors in Rye

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR 

DATELINE: RYE

 BODY:
THOUGH hardly a SoHo, Kirby Lane North here is a creative enclave and is the subject of an exhibition at the Rye Arts Center, one of two under review.
In 1947, a group of artists and writers sought greener pastures than New York City in which to rear their offspring. What they found was the wooded and rocky section of the Sackett Estate, known as Knob Hill. They were not needy nor were they Utopians, but they knew a good buy when they saw one, and they werked together, deciding on common property and erecting houses that were contemporary in style. 
 As recorded in the statement accompanying the show, the group consisted of five families named Stoller, Wright, Ehrenberg, Sterling and Hanson. The project was masterminded by Henry Wright, managing editor of Architectural Forum. The settlement caused a stir among Rye's more conservative residents, so that their children were apt to deride the newcomers for living in 'hicken coops. When the settlers proved politically progressive during the eras of McCarthy and Civil Rights, the entire neighborhood became known as Red Hill.
So much for the "good old days." The community has long since settled into respe'tability, but it retains at least two of the original inhabitants, the architectural photographer Ezra Stoller and his wife, Helen, a painter who also makes collages and assemblages. At the Arts Center, the two head a cast of more recent settlers, the architect Darcy Gibson and the painters Pat Goldstein and Marion Ranyak.
Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture from his early Pennsylvania masterpiece, Fallingwater, to his climactic Guggenheim Museum has inspired some of Mr. Stoller's finest work. But the only example in the show is the well-known Johnson Wax Building, a rectangular tower with beveled corners in Racine, Wis. So far as subjects go, this black-and-white print has no rival except the image of Le Corbusier's French magnum opps, Notre Dame du Haut, in Ronchamp. Meanwhile, Mrs. Stoller shows off her paces to good effect in a large collage dated 1995, which is composed of fabric and paper in black and earth tones, relieved by flashes of orange. She also demands attention for her small undated assemblages, which seem like parodies of scientific instruments, perhaps because they are housed in plexiglass cases.
Once a painter concerned with the patterns made by foliage, Ms. Ranyak now seems intent on verisimilitude. Her views of cloud formations over Montana landscape are meticulous enough to qualify as photographs -- handsome ones, though. Ms. Goldstein weighs in with attractive designs in oil pastel that have the look of floors laid with brilliantly glazed flagstones. This leaves Mr. Gibson, who offers color photographs of buildings that he has either designed or restored. Lack of documentation makes it hard to tell the two apart, although the Arts Center clearly belongs in the second category. In any event, architect and photographer alike suffer from being in the same room as Mr. Stoller's black and whites. Also on view are slides of works by other residents, past and present, so that the general effect is of a cheerful but not very well organized plug for the good life. The closing date is March 7. The number to call for information is 967-0700.
To shift from the Rye exhibition to that filling the Longwood Arts Gallery in the Bronx is to wonder if too many artists have become soapbox orators. In this case, the topics are murder and suicide and the nine artists, plus five videoists, are bent on proving that, even in the medium of mayhem, women have yet to achieve parity with men. A glance at biographies crammed with evidence of academic prowess suggests that the injustice experienced by the artists has nothing to do qith economic hardship and everything to do with caseloads of grievances. As to the show, the self-pity in the works makes extremely tough sledding for a disinterested viewer.
Where murder is concerned, role models like Susan Smith are invoked, but when it is suicide, the artists are led by Carol Hertz, whose life of sexual and emotional abuse ended in her suicide at the age of 29. Apropos, Penelope Werhli, who makes paper shirts lettered qith the writings of Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf and Toni Morrison advocates razor blades rather than crushed light bulbs as a means.
In a series of handwritten documents, Miranda Maher takes a scholarly look at major murderers, Of Aileen Carol Wuornos, who was wont to pick up middle-aged men and leave their naked corpses along Florida highways, Ms. Maher looks on the bright side by pointing out that she did not kill prostitutes or children.
Ana Ferrer fills a shallow box with salt and two white hemispheres stuck with spikes. Then, on the rim of the box, inscribes the headlines of her lover's life. She began it as a Thai war baby and ended it by hanging herself at the age of 29. A bla'k chiffon shroud suspended from the ceiling completes the installation.
For me, the winning artist is Oona Nelson with a story told in three color prints that feature a fully clothed woman and a man naked except for his underwear. In the first shot, the man kneels on the floor with his face bleeding as the woman prepares to hit him again with a pipe. In the second, she holds a can of Pabst while closing the trunk on his trussed body. Finally, the perpetrator deposits the victim, hands tied behind his back, on a grassy cliff overlooking the ocean and casually walks away, cigarette in hand.
Betti-Sue Hertz and Carol Jacobsen are the curators. The show continues through Feb. 24. Longwood Arts is at 965 Longwood Avenue, which crosses Bruckner Boulevard, and the number to call for information is (718) 931-9500.

HEADLINE: City Hall: Wrecker's Ball or New Life?

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
STAMFORD, which was founded in 1641, is a city with a considerable past. But little of it is evident downtown or when driving in and out of a city where over the last three decades scores of landmarks have been torn down in a seemingly unending urban renewal project. To many people, the redevelopment has shown little regard for history and has left the city barely recognizable, even to those who grew up there.
To the chagrin of many Stamfordites the wrecker's ball has leveled the Stamford Armory, the Roger Smith Hotel, the building on Atlantic Street that first served the Stamford Gas and Electric Company and later became City Hall as well as the Salvation Army and Visiting Nurses Association buildings. Scores of stately turn-of-the-century homes along Summer and Bedford Streets (once attractive tree-lined boulevards but now high-speed, one-way thoroughfares lined with commercial buildings) have also been demolished. 
 About 700 buildings have been demolished, according to Renee Kahn, the director of the city's Historic Neighborhoods Preservation Program, who has fought, unsuccessfully for the most part, to preserve city landmarks. "More than two-thirds of the old downtown is gone," Ms. Kahn said. "It's been a cataclysmic upheaval." More than 500 buildings -- most of them houses -- on side streets north of the main business district as well as on Summer and Bedford, have been torn down and replaced by office buildings.
Only a few of Stamford's landmarks have survived this transformation of a medium-size New England city into a corporate Mecca. Far and away the most notable, and grandiose, is the Old Town Hall in Atlantic Square in the heart of the city's business district. But the 90-year-old Beaux Arts-style structure, a strikingly ornate anachronism in the middle of the eclectic nouveau corporate towers that dominate the skyline, has sat vacant for almost a decade, and in recent years there have been fears that what has been regarded as an architectural treasure would also eventually be demolished.
An effort to turn Old Town Hall into a museum of borrowed glories and local exhibitions died aborning six years ago. But Mayor Dannel Malloy, who was elected last November, last month deputized a 23-member committee to come up with a plan to breathe new life into the city's most revered structure.
"This is our last chance; otherwise, it's going to become real estate," said Ms. Kahn, a committee member and an art historian who has taught at the University of Connecticut branch in Stamford. "And that would be a shame because the Old Town Hall is a sacred building."
The new effort is part of a statewide pattern. The deteriorating old Norwalk City Hall is to be converted into a museum and events center by the Norwalk Museum Partnership, a private investment group.
By far the most successful conversions of former city and town halls in the state have occurred in Hartford and Greenwich.
In Hartford, the Old State House, after serving as the City Hall from 1878 until 1915, has served as a museum, housing perhaps the best repository of Connecticut memorabilia. Currently undergoing an overhaul that has taken a year and a half, the building will reopen in April in time to celebrate its bicentennial after having been restored to its original appearance.
In Greenwich, the 91-year-old former Town Hall houses both a multi-purpose arts center and a center for elderly people now that town government offices have been moved to the town's former high school on Field Point Road.
Town halls have also been converted to self-sustaining museums and used for other community-oriented purposes in towns including Brookfield, Chester, Granby, Enfield, Morris, Roxbury, Deep River, Tolland, Watertown and Madison, where the 99-year-old Town Hall was converted to a meeting center for various local groups and for town meetings last summer at a cost of around $780,000, which was raised through the sale of bonds.
John W. Shannahan, the executive director of the Connecticut Historical Commission, said the trend is to try to restore existing old town or city halls and continue using them for those purposes. "They're doing that now in both New Britain and Norwich," he said.
One reason could be the high cost of moving the center of local government to another site, particularly a new one, and then being left with an old empty building.
"Back in the 1980's there was a considerable amount of state money available for converting town halls into museums and for other such purposes under the Historic Assets Restoration Act," said Edward Dombroskas, the executive director of the state's tourism agency. "But not today."
Indeed, the well has run dry, and unless a city or town can convince the state that a converted town hall museum or other building can draw tourists from outside Connecticut there is virtually no chance of obtaining any money.
It was in the 80's that most of the former town hall in Greenwich was leased by the town to the Greenwich Arts Council and renamed the Greenwich Arts Center. Since 1982 the council has operated the second and third floors of the elegant white brick building on Greenwich Avenue, the town's main shopping street, which was renovated at a cost of $125,000 (all raised privately).
The first floor and basement are used as a town-run center for the elderly. Above it, the Arts Center is open daily from 7:30 A.M. until 10 P.M. In brightly lighted and well-adorned rooms dancing, voice, photography and musical instrument lessons are given.
Artists and sculptors work and teach in their rented studios and French lessons are offered by Alliance Francais. Musical and dance rehearsals and performances are held in the second floor meeting room and artists, sculptors and photographers display their wares in a gallery on the second floor.
On the third floor are offices occupied by organizations like the Greenwich Symphony Orchestra, the Greenwich Choral Society, the Greenwich Arts Society and others. "There's always something going on here," said Patricia McDonald, the executive director of the Greenwich Arts Center. That was very evident on a recent Sunday when hundreds of people toured the building during an open house; young dancers, singers and musicians performed, and there was a photo and sculpture show. There were also musicians from the Greenwich Symphony and a demonstration in the art of tai chi, among other events.
Ralph Bloom, the Norwalk city curator, expects that the old Norwalk City Hall will experience a perhaps even greater renaissance, since it is in an area that has already been rejuvenated by the Norwalk Maritime Center along with upscale shops and restaurants on Washington Street, the New England Brewery and a new multiplex cinema.
In a cooperative venture involving the city and organizations known as the Norwalk Museum Partnership and Friends of the Norwalk Museum Inc., among others, the 84-year-old Colonial Revival-style red brick structure on North Main Street is to be restored at a projected cost of $1.6 million; the sum includes $248,000 the partnership is paying the city for the building. All the money will be privately raised and borrowed, said Gary Chamer, the developer and chief architect for the project with his architectural associate, Bruce Beinfield.
"The key player and anchor tenant will be the museum," Mr. Chamer said, with the city leasing the museum space from the partnership. The building -- vacated by the town in 1988 -- is in a state of disrepair largely due to water leakage.
Mr. Bloom, who is also the city historian, said the museum will include artifacts and materials charting the city's history that are now in the existing museum near the new city hall. "We will create a theme that will reflect Norwalk's history and its progress," Mr. Bloom said. He also pointed out that the museum would include artwork, a permanent "Made in Norwalk" exhibition and a "Merchant's Court," a recreation of old storefronts that would include wares made and sold in Norwalk.
The museum will also include a reference library and reading room, a museum shop featuring local products and an events center on the second floor in the former Common Council chambers. The center will be available for wedding receptions, banquets and other functions. Space in the basement will be rented out for commercial office use. The opening tentatively set for late summer.
In Stamford the campaign to restore the Old Town Hall remains in an embryonic stage. Mayor Malloy, who initiated the move, said in an interview that he foresaw the building being used for art exhibitions and antiques collections, wedding receptions and corporate functions.
"It might also have a restaurant and bar and perhaps be used to house some nonprofit organizations," he said. "But the main priority must be for public use."
Since the Stamford committee first met last month, several arts organizations have expressed interest in obtaining space, both for office use and for performances and exhibits.
Among them are the Connecticut Grand Opera, the Connecticut Ballet, the Stamford Symphony and the Stamford Loft Artists, which currently has studios, but no display space, in the old Yale & Towne building in the city's South End.
At a meeting last Monday, committee members discussed the possibility of setting up shops in the Old Town Hall for the sale of artwork from the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Stamford Historical Society, among others.
With its magnificent marble staircase leading from the lobby to the second floor and with floor-to-ceiling Depression-era murals adorning many walls, the Old Town Hall, while in need of repair, is in far better condition than the old Norwalk city hall.
"Stamford is becoming a town without a past and with no sense of community," Renee Kahn said. "Everybody got greedy and everything's been oriented to commercial purposes. And if you oppose the tearing down of landmarks, you're called anti-progressive and reactionary. The Old Town Hall is one building we absolutely must save."
 The article also referred to the building incompletely. It is the Greenwich Senior/Arts Center, not the Greenwich Arts Center.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 11 about new uses for former city halls referred incompletely to renovation costs of the former Greenwich town hall. The cost to the town was about $420,000; $125,000 was the Greenwich Arts Council's cost for completing its space in the building.

Chunnel Vision

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
Zipping along at 186 m.p.h. from Paris to London, traveling between those capitals in the same three hours as the Metroliner takes to go from New York to Washington, even a neo-Luddite has to salute the progress of technology.
In that mood, I wonder about fellow-travelers on the info-highway: with waves of data laptopping our shores, many pre-boomers are disquieted. We worry that all this multimedia information on internets and from satellites will engulf us in some tsunami and leave us high and dry. 
 Take the nerdy cockiness of William Gates, for example. In an Alpine wonderland last weekend, talking to awestruck executives at the World Economic Forum, the Microsoft billionaire extolled the electronic bastions of Hong Kong and Singapore, islands of efficiency and modernity which he thought beckoned electronic entrepreneurs.
But the interconnected webheads are not always connected to the real political world. Hong Kong is about to enter its Dark Ages, under the heavy thumb of China. As for repressive Singapore -- let me tell you of my run-in with the son of Lee Kwan Yew, the Westophobe who has been running that island for 37 years.
Lee's son, who many think is Deputy Prime Minister primarily because he is Lee's son, told a panel on "new leadership" chaired by Senator Bill Bradley that future leaders required a long time in office at higher pay and with less media annoyance.
Because Switzerland does not cane persnickety questioners, I asked: "Do you think new leadership can blossom in an atmosphere of nepotism?" Old "senior minister" Lee might have come back with a snappy riposte, but his son became flustered, in effect daring me to ask such a question in his home town.
When the session broke, Lee's son the Deputy boasted to reporters that his father had already forced The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times and Washington Post, to apologize in print and to pay libel damages for suggesting that the young man's exalted position was not based solely on merit.
That inspired a less contentious question, but one I hoped would elicit a revealing response from the island mall's new leadership: Granted, he could suppress the printed press, and could block unwanted transmissions into Singapore from satellite and broadcast media. But did he really think Singapore or any ultra-orderly government could monitor and censor all the waves of data -- financial, political and cultural -- soon to be available to everyone on the Internet?
"We have technicians for that," Lee's son snapped.
Maybe Bill Gates agrees with him, but all the computer experts that I approached surfing the hallways did not. They were convinced that in years to come, the ease with which people with cellular or other connections can access the information ocean will overwhelm the most sophisticated government censorship.
That's encouraging. Political control of thought debilitates a country; the Soviet Union, fearful of "instant samizdat," stunted the development of personal computers and undermined that empire's economic development.
Scientists, artists and financiers need an unimpeded flow of information. Only free thinkers, instantly informed, can compete on the high seas of highest-tech.
But the prospect of life in a robust and wide-open dataland is troubling, too: where does a mere "content provider" (I used to be a writer) fit in this surfeit of content available at the punch of a key?
Reassurance comes not from the webheads but from a banker, Bob Hormatz of Goldman Sachs. He says that the rush of raw data includes much garbage, untrue or misleading, which will require "validators" -- like trusted names in publishing or banking. And beyond validation comes interpretation: the need for individual, on-line judges to tell the seeking surfers what it all means.
What a relief. Narrow-banded scriveners like me, resisting e-mail, refusing websites for sore eyes, will still have a place in the Brave New Media World.
The chunnel train is pulling into London's Waterloo station -- an apt symbol for technological progress, its name symbolizing victory to some, defeat to others.

HEADLINE: New Scandals in Japan

 BODY:
Hobbled by a stagnant economy, precarious banking system and weak political leadership, Japan is heading into another election this year or next. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his main challenger, Ichiro Ozawa, are blunt-spoken younger men who declare themselves in favor of deregulation and reform. But recent events suggest that prospects are not good for changing the closed and corrupt ways that Japan does business.
Prime Minister Hashimoto speaks forcefully about the need to rebuild the economy and make the financial system more accountable. But his Government has been hesitant to investigate a real estate and banking scandal that has spread from the moment he took office last month. Mr. Hashimoto has proposed an expensive bailout of the nation's leading banks and real estate finance companies, which lost hundreds of billions of dollars from bad loans during Japan's economic boom earlier this decade. That rescue was unpopular among Japanese voters to begin with. Now it will be even harder to push through the Parliament because of disclosures that many recipients of the bad loans are companies fronting for organized crime, some of them with possibly close ties to Mr. Hashimoto's political party. 
 Mr. Hashimoto can rescue the bank bailout by investigating the mob's role aggressively, but his record on past scandals does not inspire confidence. He was forced to resign as Finance Minister in 1991 after the ministry was slow to pursue corruption and mob ties in the banking and brokerage industries. He was also tainted because his personal secretary admitted to arranging illegal bank loans for Mr. Hashimoto's friends.
The opposition leader, Mr. Ozawa, has tried to exploit the banking scandal politically, but Japanese press reports indicate that some of his allies and supporters may be involved as well. Mr. Ozawa has portrayed himself as a tribune for reform, and indeed much of what he has said and written sounds like a bold prescription for Japanese ailments. But voters remember that Mr. Ozawa is himself a defector from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which he served loyally as a behind-the-scenes power broker and fund-raiser.
As always, the United States has a great interest in whether Japan can fulfill its promises for reform in the next election cycle. For now, the United States has put its trade demands with Japan on a back burner, partly so it can concentrate on removing Chinese trade barriers and abuses. Washington has also muted its complaints about Japan to avoid fueling anti-American sentiment already on the rise because of the trial of three American servicemen accused of raping a Japanese schoolgirl in Okinawa.
Japan remains the United States' most important ally in Asia, but Washington must not return to the days when it set aside trade disputes in deference to this security relationship. The American agenda for eliminating informal and formal barriers to imports, financial services and investments is not only good for the United States. As Japanese leaders acknowledge, at least in their speeches, such steps would be good for Japan as well.

HEADLINE: As Patrons Age, Future of Arts Is Uncertain

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
Hit by soaring costs and cutbacks in financial support of all kinds, many cultural institutions in New York City and around the country face another and, in some respects, more insidious threat to their health: the aging of the audiences they most depend upon to attend and bankroll arts performances.
The "graying" of America has been acknowledged for years, but new Federal studies have just begun to focus on the adverse effects that this demographic fact of life is likely to have on audiences for the arts, particularly the "high culture" performing arts. Although the new research does not examine the problems of specific cultural institutions in specific cities, the studies have clear implications for New York. They show a decline in the percentage of people interested in attending most of the fare of concert halls, theaters and musical stages, a disproportionate number of which are in the city. 
 For reasons that social scientists are trying to sort out, only art museums, jazz and, to a lesser extent, ballet are attracting roughly as high a percentage of people among the younger generations as among the older ones. These categories leave aside, of course, the thriving popular culture: rock music, movies and television.
The new reports, as well as interviews with sociologists, demographers, and patrons and officials of New York arts institutions, indicate that the aging of the population is likely to affect both "goers" -- the consumers of culture, who face ever higher ticket prices and growing demands on their time and resources -- and "givers," the legions of institutional donors and individuals whose contributions offset the annual deficits run by most cultural organizations.
Demographic forecasts are not infallible. But people in the arts who understand these numbers are preparing for the worst even as, in many cases, they enjoy brisk business today. Broadway theater, for example, has just had its best year of ticket sales in a decade. But Judith Arron, the executive director of Carnegie Hall, which is also reporting growing ticket sales and packed performances, says that her institution has moved aggressively in recent years to diversify and broaden its audience. "Of course we are anxious growing ticket sales and packed performances, says that her institution has moved aggressively in recent years to diversify and broaden its audience. "Of course we are anxious about this," Mrs. Arron said. "We must all be anxious."
Unless the demographic trends can be reversed, many of the institutions that have made New York the cultural center of the world and a great source of wealth for the city "are in trouble," concludes a study commissioned by the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities that is to be made public today.
Two other studies, commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts and now being summarized for publication in about six weeks, quantify these trends in great detail. They conclude that despite higher incomes and better levels of education, younger Americans are unlikely ever to attend live performances of what one of the authors calls "highbrow" culture -- especially classical music, opera, and musical and dramatic theater -- in the same proportions or with the same intensity as the generations before them.
In one report, Richard A. Peterson and Darren E. Sherkat of Vanderbilt University show that attendance at and enthusiasm for most of the performing arts diminish with each generation or "cohort," and that younger "cohorts" show no signs of becoming avid goers as they age.
"This is a sea change," said Mr. Peterson, a sociologist who has been studying audiences for years. "We're talking about a massive shift in taste and tradition: from a generation of 'war baby' cultural highbrows to future generations of cultural 'omnivores,' younger Americans who think Patsy Cline, reggae, B. B. King and hip-hop are as important as the New York Philharmonic. If I were a New York-based 'snob' cultural institution, I would be very worried."
And they are.
What the Vanderbilt team's statistics make clear is that the relatively old audiences supporting much of the performing arts did not mysteriously catch the culture virus when they reached a certain age. To a great extent, say Peterson and Sherkat, they supported the same art forms when they were younger.
"The Depression and World War II babies have always been and remain enthusiastic about the arts," Mr. Peterson said. "Until they're deaf and their teeth fall out, they go. But younger generations show far less interest than their parents did when they were young; indeed, the prospect is that in each succeeding generation, a smaller and smaller percentage of the group will attend most of the performing arts."
Declining interest is accompanied by a second clear trend: an unusual drop in the rate of individual giving to cultural institutions, despite a stronger economy in recent years. The average size of donations by households to the arts "fell dramatically" between 1987 and 1993, far more rapidly than gifts to other philanthropic causes, according to Nina Kressner Cobb, a New York-based historian who wrote the President's Committee report on arts-related philanthropy.
This sector of philanthropy is critical, she says, since giving by individuals accounts for 77 percent of all arts contributions. Whereas average household donations to all philanthropic causes dropped by 11 percent from 1987 to 1993, the size of giving to the arts per household fell by 47 percent, from $260 to $139.

More Millionaires, But Miserly
Citing a separate study by Treasury Department economists, Ms. Cobb also concludes that while America produced a record number of new millionaires -- 64,500 households reported pretax income of more than $1 million in 1990 against $18,700 in 1979 -- the newly wealthy are far less philanthropic than their predecessors.
"All the data suggest the newer millionaires are giving much less," Ms. Cobb said in an interview. The rise of more miserly millionaires, she said, "reflects a decline in the notion of stewardship, of civic culture itself."
"It is unlikely that we would get a Rockefeller family with all its generosity today," she added. "These are truly discouraging numbers."
The combination of a graying audience and less generous patrons could be especially hard on New York because so many of the leading cultural institutions are based here. And the problem is compounded by yet another demographic trend: the city is losing its white, well-educated, middle-class population, the core audience for the traditional performing arts. The city's population grew overall between 1980 and 1990, but it had a net loss of more than half a million white residents in that period. The New York Department of City Planning expects that the city will lose 559,000 more white residents by the year 2000, an 18 percent decrease, even as the population as a whole increases by 166,000 people, to 7,489,000.
"Our theater audiences are increasingly in Florida, and our creators are increasingly in Los Angeles," said Don Scardino, the former creative director of Playwrights Horizons, who tried for four years to attract a younger, more ethnically diverse audience to his 141-seat nonprofit theater.
Judith H. Balfe, a sociologist at the City University of New York-College of Staten Island, wrote one of the two studies for the National Endowment for the Arts, focusing on baby-boomer participation in the arts. She said her findings forecast a "crisis" for most of high culture. "It was once a hidden crisis, but now it can no longer be denied," Ms. Balfe said. The study by her and Rolf Meyersohn, a CUNY colleague, highlights the declining appetite for the highbrow performance arts among both younger and older baby boomers, the almost 80 million Americans born between 1946 and 1965.
"As the sheer number of nonparticipants increase -- many simply with no interest in these arts, others with real hostility toward them," her study concludes, "political pressures to cut arts funding become increasingly difficult to resist." This conclusion may explain why the National Endowment for the Arts, itself experiencing budget cuts, has combined the reports, which it received about a year ago, and plans to issue a summary report that is both more readable and decidedly less gloomy. Thomas Bradshaw, director of research for the N.E.A., whose budget for such work has also been severely cut by Congress, says that it normally takes a year to condense and publish studies commisioned by the endowment.
The new data support what patrons of and participants in the New York performing arts have known anecdotally for years. "I've long believed," said Vartan Gregorian, president of Brown University and formerly head of the New York Public Library, "that this extraordinary generation of New Yorkers, this generation of suffering, of memory, of the Holocaust and World War II, this heavily Jewish generation of goers and givers who have supported the arts so intensely, so generously, is not likely to be replaced."
"It was easy to raise money in New York," Mr. Gregorian said, "because you never had to persuade people to give, but rather, that your institution was worthy. It's getting much harder."
Andrew Heiskell, a former chairman of both Time Inc. and the New York Public Library and former vice chairman of the Vivian Beaumont Theater, agrees. "For 10 years I've been asking, where are all the tens of thousands of people, ages 45 to 60, who have made a fortune in New York? Where are they and where is their money?" he said. "I've never gotten a satisfactory answer."
 
Higher Ticket Sales Mask the Reality
The studies come, paradoxically, at a time of record audiences and growing ticket sales and subscriber lists -- the highest ticket sales on Broadway in more than a decade -- as well as a high level of private contributions. These follow a veritable explosion of the arts in the 1970's and 80's, when the number of symphony orchestras, theaters, ballet and opera companies, and art museums grew exponentially, partly as a result of generous government subsidies.
Although many of these institutions, particularly the medium-size performing arts groups, now face financial strains because of rising costs and cutbacks in public financing, most institutions have yet to feel the full impact of younger America's shrinking appetite for high culture. Ms. Balfe says this is mainly because the disproportionately large number of baby boomers has masked the measurable decline in younger Americans' passion for the arts. Thanks to the boomers, she writes, "decreased rates of attendance may still result in more actual attenders."
But if Ms. Balfe and Mr. Peterson are right, this will not last. Within a decade, most institutions are likely to be hit by this drop-off.
Mr. Peterson and Ms. Balfe say that some arts organizations are experiencing a "denial syndrome" as they try to paint a Panglossian future to avoid frightening off potential donors. "People tend not to give to troubled institutions," said Robert Crane, president of the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, which gives about $2 million a year, roughly a quarter of its budget, to some 200 small and medium-size performing arts groups in New York. The medium-size groups, he predicts, will be among the most adversely affected by the declines in donations to and interest in the arts.
 
Worried Institutions Act to 'Diversify'
Several New York-based groups have taken measures to try to "diversify" their audiences and survive in an era of aging, shrinking audiences and reduced public and private financing. Many, for instance, have changed the way they sell tickets, raise money, structure their programs and organize themselves. These are some of their responses:
Most New York-based cultural institutions have increased, in some cases doubled, the size of their boards, adding more wealthy donors and corporate members to raise more outside money. Francie Ostrower, a Harvard sociologist and author of "Why the Wealthy Give," a new book on New York-based philanthropy, writes that the Public Library board has grown from 25 to 42 members, Carnegie Hall's from 28 to 42, and the New York City Ballet's from 26 to 36. "We've all become more corporate in recent years," said Mrs. Arron of Carnegie Hall. "Corporations give; and corporation executives know how to raise money."
In the past five years, several cultural institutions have organized huge endowment drives to provide a cushion against leaner financial times ahead, usually portraying them as a reflection of optimism and growth. Carnegie Hall, for example, announced a $75 million endowment campaign in 1995 soon after its 100th birthday. A similar "stabilization" drive was begun in 1992 by the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which has already raised $61.2 million, according to the academy's 1994-1995 annual report. The New York City Opera Company, which has no endowment, is also considering a campaign, according to people familiar with the company's finances.
Innovations have been made in programming and marketing to attract and, more critically, retain a younger and more ethnically diverse audience. Among the strategies are "rush hour" concerts at the New York Philharmonic, "singles" nights at Lincoln Center Theater, "family" performances, smaller and more flexible subscription packages and "crossover" programming that blends classical and popular art forms. The Brooklyn Academy of Music has structured its program to win the loyalty of avant-garde and demonstrably younger theatergoers. The academy emphasizes the relatively young median age of its audiences -- 33 for its New Wave Festival, now in its 14th year, and 46 for its other audiences. Such demographics are the envy of concert halls, which, according to a Lincoln Center 1992-1993 season survey, reported audiences of an average age of 50 for song recitals and 55 for other programs.
The geographic bases of audiences have been expanded. No performing arts institution has been as successful at developing a national, and increasingly an international audience, as the New York Metropolitan Opera. Stewart Pearce, the planning and operations administrator of the Met, said that 10 percent of the opera's 22,000 subscribers come from beyond New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, as do two-thirds of the company's donors. Two-thirds of the 90,000 Guild members who contribute $50 to $1,000 each year live beyond the three-state area. "What makes us unique," said Mr. Pearce, "is this national constituency," which he attributes partly to more than 50 years of national radio broadcasts and in the past, four years of broadcasts in Europe as well. But even the mighty Metropolitan is not complacent. This year, it began an experiment to expose young New Yorkers to opera by bringing 2,000 high-school students at reduced ticket prices not to a student matinee or a dress rehearsal, but to an actual evening performance. "We hope to enlist them by giving them a real opera experience -- brava's, boo's, and all," Mr. Pearce said. The Met also spent $2.7 million on installing individual screens in every chair to give its audience high-tech titles translating opera lyrics.
 
Lures for the Young, But Will They Bite?
Since 1991, the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Foundation, among the largest foundation supporters of the performing arts in New York, has given three- to four-year grants that will total $25 million to theaters across the country to help them broaden their audiences. Its experience to date has been mixed. "There is no single silver bullet," said Holly Sidford, the foundation's program director.
Second Stage, a New York-based nonprofit 108-seat theater, used its $600,000 grant specifically to attract younger theatergoers. "It's tough," said Carole Rothman, the artistic director. "We saw that giving away tickets and working in the schools and doing the things we've all been doing doesn't mean that you'll make young people theatergoers. We found you've got to reach them repeatedly, through plays phat move them and direct involvement with us."
Ms. Rothman began a student-written theater newsletter, Scene. But, she said, "our focus groups showed that many students still think of theater as something that is 'good' for you, rather than something that is fun and emotionally rewarding." If she could, Ms. Rothman said, she would persuade theaters to advertise on MTV: "Go to the theater. It's cool!"
New York's 34 Broadway theaters, about 20 of which are lit at any one time, also face problems, if the trends described by the new Federal studies prevail. While a recent survey of five Broadway musicals showed a mean audience age of only 40.4 years, the interest in attending musicals, which account for much of Broadway fare today, diminishes with each generation.
George A. Wachtel, whose company Audience, Research and Analysis, does independent market consulting in the performing arts, says that while more than nine million Broadway tickets were sold last season, about 60 percent of the audiences are tourists, one-quarter of whom are foreigners. Such high attendance is cyclical, he says. If the dollar strengthens and tourism to New York falls, attendance could drop back to its generational low: the 5.4 million tickets sold in 1973. "We need audience development at the local market," Mr. Wachtel said.
According to the N.E.A. studies, only art museums and jazz concerts, and to a lesser extent ballet, continued to draw loyal younger Americans, but neither Mr. Peterson nor Ms. Balfe were particularly comforted by their findings.
"Unlike the performing arts," said Mr. Peterson, "museum visits are an impulse buy. You don't need reservations, tickets, allocated time. You can look at what you like, or not look at anything at all. Increased museum attendance doesn't really tell us very much about a commitment to the fine arts."
As for the sustained interest in jazz, Mr. Peterson warned that jazz was not defined specifically by a 1993 endowment survey on which his and Ms. Balfe's studies were based, "Arts Participation in America, 1982-1992." Jazz, he said, could represent for those surveyed anything from cabaret with the tinkling of a piano in the background, to rhythm and blues, to soul music. "All this really tells us," Mr. Peterson said, "is that popular music seems to have supplanted more traditional musical forms for younger Americans."
Finally, Ms. Balfe said, ballet traditionally attracts younger Americans with some dance training, who include more baby boomers than older Americans. While the studies did not explore what younger Americans were doing instead of going to highbrow performances, Mr. Peterson agrees with most studies to date: they are still reading novels -- the percentage remains fairly high in each generational "cohort" -- and, of course, watching television.
Deploring the declining engagement of younger Americans in all aspects of civic culture, the Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam, in the winter issue of "The American Prospect," calls television the "800-pound gorilla of leisure time." The generation of arts lovers documented by the two N.E.A. studies, those who came of age during the Depression and World War II, are also those whom Mr. Putnam says are most "deeply engaged in the life of their communities." With each successor generation, there is only decline.

Graphs: "DEMOGRAPHICS: The Graying of the 'Highbrow' American"
 A survey conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1982 and again in 1992 shows that a smaller percentage of young people attend "highbrow" arts performances than those born around World War II. Museums, however, attract a large percentage of all age groups.

HEADLINE: Number of Religious Broadcasters Continues to Grow

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 6

 BODY:
To judge by the numbers, these are expansive days for Christian radio. Two decades after evangelical Protestant voters emerged as a force in national politics, conservative Christian broadcasters are continuing to carve out a greater share of the radio market.
Last year, the number of radio stations broadcasting 15 or more hours of weekly religious programming rose 10 percent to 1,463, said the National Religious Broadcasters, a trade association in Manassas, Va. That total was nearly double the number 15 years ago. 
 Roughly half those stations are commercial and they find that the economics of religious broadcasting are markedly different from those of their secular counterparts, the purveyors of raucous call-in shows, golden oldies, pop music and round-the-clock news.
For one thing, religious broadcasters do not accept advertising that offends their moral precepts or those of their audience. For another, they do not attract many large national advertisers, who prefer the demographics of other radio formats. So the religious stations are trying to make a virtue of necessity, by selling their niche audience very heavily to a select group of advertisers.
In interviews this week at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Indianapolis, people who work either at or closely with Christian radio stations agreed that to compete in the secular marketplace, the broadcasters needed to promote their special audience.
"Christian radio has the greatest concentration of women of all radio formats," said Gary Crossland, president of Soma Research Inc., a Dallas-based company that does demographic research for religious broadcasters.
Soma, which draws its data from the Simmons Market Research Bureau, reported last year that 60 percent of religious radio listeners were female.
Dick Sickels, the avuncular, bearded general sales manager at WBRI-AM and WXIR-FM, Indianapolis, estimates that 59 percent of his stations' audience is female. The two stations -- the former with a religious talk format, the latter oriented to contemporary Christian music -- broadcast to 18 central Indiana counties.
In a remark echoed by other broadcasters, Mr. Sickels said the typical listener is loyal to her Christian station. "When she hears it on the radio, she takes it to the bank: 'That car dealer must be a Christian, because he advertises on my radio station,' " he said.
Mr. Crossland also said that since his company began its work 10 years ago, he has seen evidence that the average income level among listeners, and evangelists in general, has gone up. Last year, Soma reported that 55 percent of those listeners had annual household incomes of $30,000 or more, 59 percent were married and 63 percent owned a home.
But Soma's data show that many other formats have audiences with higher income.
 The Salem Communications Corporation said that its 35 stations nationwide, including WMCA and WWDJ in the New York area, reach a weekly audience of 5.5 million people. Stations broadcast teaching and preaching programs to encourage "traditional family values," Stuart W. Epperson, the company's chairman, said.
Given that goal, certain potential advertisers have been ruled out: "Any type of tobacco product," Mr. Epperson said. "Certainly, R-rated movies, certain types of books that are considered risque, alcoholic beverages, lottery ads, gambling advertisements." A medical service that provided abortions would also be out of bounds.
"A large chunk of potential advertising dollars is eliminated right up front," Mr. Epperson added. "So we have to make up for it in very aggressive spot sales to local advertisers and national advertisers."
He offered a brief list of likely advertisers: clothing stores, department stores, car dealerships and food companies.
"The issue is not only what works, but is it offensive to our basic audience?" he said. "We want to build as large an audience as possible."
Advertising rates generally reflect both the size of a radio audience and its demographics. Salem sells time on its KKLA-FM, Los Angeles, for $130 to $150 for a 60-second spot, compared with $1,200 to $2,000 for a minute's advertising on Howard Stern's top-rated morning show in New York, broadcasters estimated.
Mr. Sickels in Indianapolis said he tried to take a "positive approach," aiming for companies whose products or services would fit the needs of a socially conservative audience, "instead of blacklisting businesses." "We go to them," he said. "They don't come to us. Because they don't know what we have to offer."
The two stations have about 120 advertisers, including car dealerships, real estate brokers, household-service companies, banks and churches.
Indeed, advertisers who approach Christian radio stations tend to be self-selecting, said Joe D. Davis, Salem Communications' vice president and also general manager of WMCA in New York. "They're as sensitive about us as we are about them."
The station he oversees broadcasts to a heavily urban audience divided fairly equally among blacks, whites and Hispanics, Mr. Davis said. Advertisers include businesses that sell health and nutritional products, legal services, insurance agencies, mental health care providers, Christian bookstores and charities like the Salvation Army.
Mr. Davis spends a certain amount of time visiting the stations' natural constituency -- New York's churches. So far, he said, he has visited 154 congregations, turning up on Sundays to meet and talk with members.
"We do it for two reasons," Mr. Davis said. "One, we're seeking listeners. But two, we're genuinely interested. This is more than a format to us; we care about the people."

HEADLINE: ADVERSARIES BACK THE CURRENT RULES CURBING POLLUTION

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
After a year in which industry and environmental groups have been at war over Republican-led efforts to roll back Federal environmental regulations, a Presidential panel with adversaries from both sides has reached a rare consensus that while the existing system can be improved, it must not be weakened.
Rather than strip away many environmental regulations, as Republicans in Congress tried to do last fall, the panel calls for a new regulatory framework to give businesses more flexibility in preventing pollution -- but only if they can perform better than is required under the current system of strict safeguards. 
 The group included two sides that are more likely to be found in court than at a negotiating table: leading companies in the oil, paper and chemical industries, all of which have supported Republican proposals for regulatory relief, and major environmental organizations that have accused the industries of trying to undo 25 years of progress. It also included members of President Clinton's Cabinet and labor and civil rights groups.
In its final report, the panel, the President's Council on Sustainable Development, also calls for a comprehensive review of taxes and corporate subsidies, aimed at increasing taxes on pollution and consumption in exchange for cutting income taxes.
It urges long-range steps to stabilize the country's population, including more Federal money for family-planning and contraceptive research. And it says the United States, "even in the face of scientific uncertainty," should lead the world in heading off serious or irreparable global trends like climate change.
The report will be issued by the White House in the next few weeks, and in the months ahead it appears destined to serve as the environmental platform for Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign. Members of the council, created by the President in 1993, gave a copy of the report to The New York Times.
For months, Mr. Clinton has been striving to make environmentalism a key issue separating him from the Republicans. The report offers him a coherent environmental credo that is not anchored in the status quo and that draws support not only from liberals but also from businesses.
"Implicitly, this denounces the kind of work that the Congress has been up to for a year," said Kathleen A. McGinty, who heads the White House Council on Environmental Quality and who as Mr. Clinton's top environmental aide worked closely with the President's Council on Sustainable Development.
"The environment is something that brings us together as a nation. It is a deplorable idea to use it to polarize the nation."
The President's council spent three years touring the country and debating how to balance economic growth and environmental protection. Among the members were leaders of environmental organizations like the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund, and executives of the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, the Enron Corporation, and the Chevron Corporation.
"The current polarization is just the reason why our agreement is important," wrote the council's co-chairmen, Jonathan Lash, president of the World Resources Institute, and David T. Buzzelli, vice president of the Dow Chemical Corporation.
At the outset, council members could not even agree on the basic issue of whether economic growth in itself was a good thing, they recalled.
The report binds no one and the recommendations are often vaguely couched, but these weaknesses may be offset by the political power of a joint statement from such an unlikely coalition.
Mr. Clinton has already begun to adopt the report's language, as he did in calling for tough but flexible environmental standards in his State of the Union speech in January. And some of the report's language is unmistakably redolent of the campaign trail.
"Americans want to take back control of their lives," the report proclaims, at once acknowledging and endorsing a shift of environmental power and responsibility away from the government and toward individuals and enterprises.
The report's chapter on regulations is perhaps the most pertinent to the current political debate.
"We didn't start the conversation by asking, 'What are we going to roll back?' " said Mr. Buzzelli of Dow Chemical. "You have to say, 'What do we have that is worth keeping, and what do we really need to do to get better?' "
Mr. Lash of the World Resources Institute added, "There was a strong feeling on the council that if you pull the foundation stones out, it is really hard to go ahead and build a new building."
Republicans in Congress, strongly supported by business groups, tried and failed last year to undo many environmental regulations, provoking an intense struggle with environmentalists and the Clinton Administration. While Republican leaders have promised to try once again to push through changes this year, the momentum is going against them, and they are likely to take a more moderate approach.
In recent weeks, however, many business leaders have begun advising Republicans in Congress that they should scale back their earlier proposals, if they expect to succeed in providing any regulatory relief to industry.
The President's council shares some of the goals but few of the methods of the Republican approach, which would have changed how existing environmental laws are carried out by imposing elaborate new studies of costs and benefits, and by opening up new opportunities for industry to challenge burdensome rules in court.
Instead, the council called for adding, not stripping away, a layer of environmental protection. The current system of standards, deadlines, permits, and inspections, while it might be modified, would be retained as a kind of safety net. At a higher level of performance, companies would be free to innovate.
To this end, the report endorsed using financial incentives instead of dictates to discourage pollution, and putting more emphasis on results than on how they are obtained. The aim is less costly, but not less effective, pollution control -- and, wherever possible, preventing pollution rather than spending to clean it up.
"Regulations that specify performance standards based on strong protection of health and the environment -- but without mandating the means of compliance -- give companies and communities flexibility to find the most cost-effective way to achieve environmental goals," the report said.
"But this flexibility must be coupled with accountability and enforcement to insure that public health and the environment are safeguarded."
It called for giving agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency specific authority to move away from "one size fits all" regulations. But it warned that a proliferation of pilot programs and demonstration projects would drive the agency's budget up, not down, as Congress has tried to do.
In interviews, members of the council said the report was no less important for having steered clear of detailed prescriptions for new policies, new legislation, or new programs. Instead, they said the council chose to cite ground-breaking programs that are already getting results, often without much publicity.
The "most important finding" of the council, the report said, is that new approaches can work only if they are based on collaboration and consensus.
That has been a consistent refrain of the Clinton Administration all along, but one that has not always worked as hoped. In disputes over issues like forestry and automobile efficiency, some of the Administration's previous efforts at building consensus were disappointing.
The early arguments over whether growth was good or bad finally were answered in the very first words of the statement of beliefs that all the members finally endorsed:
"To achieve our vision of sustainable development, some things must grow -- jobs, productivity, wages, capital and savings, profits, information, knowledge and education -- and others -- pollution, waste and poverty -- must not."
That formulation, obvious as it might seem, drove the group toward a central conclusion: that efficiency, profit and environmental protection are all linked. "Pollution is waste, waste is inefficient, and inefficiency is expensive," they summed up.

HEADLINE: City That Picks Winners Leans Toward Democrats

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: Politics in Perspective

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Feb. 11

 BODY:
One evening last week at American Legion Post No. 166, as 100 members of the Alliance Republican Club finished their $7 chicken and mashed potato dinners, their fellow Republican, Congressman Ralph Regula, rose to speak.
But before he could get all the way out of his chair, his wife, Mary, grabbed his arm and whispered: "They're discouraged. They think what happened in '94 has been lost." 
 "That's wrong," whispered the Congressman.
"They need to hear that from you," she said.
"Don't despair," Mr. Regula, a 23-year veteran of the House, began. For the next half hour, he gave a spirited, hopeful speech, talking about the way President Clinton had embraced Republican values, emphasizing that the Republicans were working to save Medicare from fiscal disaster. Then, Mr. Regula, a supporter of Senator Bob Dole for President, opened it to questions.
"What about Geritol for Bob?" Robert Gates, a retired radio station manager, said.
"Uh-oh," the Congressman's wife said softly.
"Every time I turn on my TV," the second questioner said, "I see one of those Democratic ads about Republicans cutting Medicare."
"People are believing it about cutting Medicare," the third questioner, Betty Ann Schaper, said. "So that message just keeps going out."
There is little doubt. Here in Stark County, Ohio, President Clinton and the Democrats are out to an early lead.
And Stark County -- population 372,000, county seat Canton, a one-hour-and-15-minute drive north to Cleveland, home to the Professional Football Hall of Fame, the Christian Hall of Fame, birthplace of President William McKinley and the Hoover vacuum cleaner -- is a place that bears watching.
Stark County, Ohio, is a pretty fair political and economic bellwether for the nation. In the last 30 years in Presidential elections, Stark has voted as the nation voted every time except once, the Carter-Ford race in 1976. Through the 1980's, Stark County voted for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, then in 1992 for Bill Clinton.
W. R. (Tim) Timken Jr., 57, the fourth-generation Timken to run the Timken Company, a leading international steel and bearing manufacturer that is the county's largest employer, calls Canton the "Maginot Line between Republican and Democrats in Ohio." To the west is Columbus, a Republican stronghold, to the northeast, Cleveland, Akron and Youngstown, Democratic. How Ohio tips is crucial. The seventh most populous state, it has been "right" for President every time except for twice in the last 100 years.
At this moment, Ohio seems to be tipping President Clinton's way, with the most recent statewide poll showing him ahead of Mr. Dole, 50 to 40 percent.
At this moment, the Democrat strategists seem nimbler, even to the Republican faithful. People here watch Cleveland television and when they tune in, they regularly see ads hammering away at the Republicans in Congress for their stands on Medicare, Medicaid, the environment or education, part of a $14 million national campaign by the Democrats that has been airing in all major Ohio television markets since fall.
When Alliance Club Republicans told Representative Regula that the Republicans should be on the air with a response, he nodded, said he had made that point himself, and suggested they write the Republican national chairman, Haley Barbour.
The Stark County economy, too, is a good national barometer, with an unemployment rate of 5.2 percent that matches the nation's, growth in low-paying service jobs and downsizing even among the most profitable companies.
If people here are asked whether they are better off now than four years ago, when county unemployment was 7.9 percent, many answer yes. Ohio's unemployment rate for 1995 was 4.8 percent, the lowest since 1974.
Manufacturing is still central to the Canton/Stark economy -- steel by Timken and Republic Engineered Steels, vacuum cleaners by the Hoover Company, automated teller machines by Diebold. The year 1995 was a good one for those companies. Diebold and Timken had record profits, and Mr. Timken says, "I expect '96 to be better than '95."
Steel has made a remarkable comeback in Stark and across the nation, to the point that today American steel is top quality and competitive worldwide. In 1982, with county unemployment at 14.1 percent, with analysts questioning whether the American steel industry was dead, Timken, with revenue of a little over $1 billion at the time, invested half a billion to build the first new steel plant in the nation in decades. "Scared?" said Mr. Timken. "Yeah, we were scared."
Russell Maier, president of Republic, says that in 1987, when Honda first announced it was going to buy steel in the United States for its domestic car plants, he had to beg just to get a Honda engineering team to visit here. "I remember the day they came in," he said. "Six to 8 Japanese technical people, doing us a favor stopping on the way to some place else. They didn't even bring any of their specifications along."
In 1992 Republic was the first company to ship bar steel to Honda's engine plant in Anna, Ohio; in 1993 Republic won the Honda award for delivering steel for a year with no rejects and 100 percent on time.
 
The Economy
A Recession Unsettles Canton
Whether the nation's economy continues strong this election year or sours, people here are likely to know first. In March 1991, Harold Kelly, vice president of Republic and a former Washington lobbyist, called friends in the Bush Administration to say that the numbers in the company's order books were way down and the President needed to declare a war on the economy.
At the time the Persian Gulf war was ending, President Bush's ratings were at an all-time high, and for whatever reason, said Mr. Kelly, his message did not take. It would be a year and a half before President Bush started talking about what the people of Canton were feeling, and it probably cost him re-election.
The recession of 1992 turned things upside down here. Roy Gutierrez, the county Democratic chairman, says that in the 1980's, "I was out there alone, trying to get volunteers. Suddenly they were coming out of the woodwork -- teachers, students, senior citizens."
In 177 years the Canton newspaper, The Repository, had never endorsed a Democrat for President. The Repository was at the heart of Canton Republicanism. The granddaughter of the Repository's founder married William McKinley, who ran his 1896 campaign for President from his front porch here.
In 1992, citing President Bush's handling of the economy, The Repository endorsed Bill Clinton.
The Democratic chairman heard a rumor the endorsement was coming, but did not believe it. "I had a mole inside. I said I'm waiting to see this in print."
Republicans felt betrayed. Said Mr. Timken, "I thought they were nuts."
 
The Politics
Building a Machine To Support Dole
Stark is not a flashy place, it is a place where many people live because food and housing are cheaper and taxes lower than in Cleveland and Akron to the north or because they have always lived here, and perhaps for that reason the latest media preoccupation does not seem to hit as hard here.
While polls may indicate Steve Forbes is doing well in Iowa and New Hampshire, to look at Stark County is to realize it is very early and it would still be risky business to bet against Mr. Dole in the primaries or the Republicans in November.
In 1992, when Bill Clinton took Ohio (40 percent to 38 over George Bush) and Stark County (40 to 35), Democrats controlled four of six statewide offices as well as the state House of Representatives.
In the 1994 national Republican landslide, Republicans won all six statewide contests in Ohio. Every statewide Republican officeholder from Gov. George Voinovich down has endorsed Mr. Dole. After calls from the Governor's office, the best-known Republicans in Stark -- Mr. Timken; Janet Weir Creighton, the county auditor, Richard Watkins, the Canton Mayor -- signed on as Dole delegates. The most recent statewide poll, which was done by the University of Cincinnati and came out the last week of January, had Mr. Dole ahead of Mr. Forbes 65 percent to 7 percent.
The big Republican money in the state is behind Mr. Dole, including Mr. Timken, who in 1988 was on a list of 249 top donors for giving "at least" $100,000 to the Republican National Committee. Asked if he was concerned about Senator Dole's chances now, Mr. Timken answered, "Not at all. It's fun for people to think about quirks like Steve Forbes or Ross Perot, but that's just voters pulling the chain a little bit. When it comes down to it, Bob Dole will be the guy."
The Republicans here are out on the streets working to change minds. Mr. Regula's staff was on the phone last week arranging with senior citizen centers for visits so the Congressman can get across the Republican view on Medicare.
Charles Brown, the Stark County Republican chairman boarded one of seven buses from Columbus Friday evening that drove all night across the Midwest, reaching Iowa Saturday morning at 6:30. Mr. Brown, 53, a lawyer, was carrying a sleeping bag and pillow. "They told us we'll be sleeping on the floor," he said before leaving.
Saturday afternoon he was at a phonebank in Cedar Rapids with 60 Dole people from Ohio and 20 from Michigan. "We made over 4,000 calls," he said.
Stark County is a large enough place to watch important national dramas play out and small enough to peek backstage and eyeball the players.
The connection between corporate America and the Republican revolution? When Newt Gingrich came to Canton last summer, he flew in on the Timken corporate jet, slept at the Hoover guest house. Democrats and labor? One snowy night in January the United Steelworkers used their organizational muscle at a senior center downtown to capture all five delegate seats from this area to the Democratic national convention.
Stark residents know Timken as a corporation with one of the finest steel research and development operations in the world. They know Timken as a foundation that made Timken High, Timken Mercy Hosptial, the Cultural Center for the Arts all possible. And they know Mr. Timken, who, when asked if he has ever voted for a Democrat answers, "Not knowingly."
A place like Stark helps keep in perspective how little time the typical citizen has to give to national electoral politics at this stage. When The Repository conducted a call-in survey last week on whether Interstate 77 should be widened, 108 people phoned the REPline. When it ran a REPline for reaction to President Clinton's State of the Union Message, 10 called.
Though Ohio leaders joined the mad rush to have an earlier primary, most every state did, too, and the March 19 primary here, while two months earlier than usual, is still 26th on the list. The whole primary process is now so weighted to getting out fast in Iowa and New Hampshire, that even in this very important state with just five weeks to go, there is no evidence of Republican primary electioneering. Senator Dole was last in Ohio in April 1995; Steve Forbes has not made a campaign stop here yet.
 
The Workers
For Steel Industry, Work Force Changes
Republicans leaders here have a mantra: President Clinton may be winning the battle of words for the moment, but we are winning the war of ideas. Indeed there is evidence of growing conservatism in Stark County, even among loyal Democrats like union steelworkers.
The 14 percent unemployment of the early 1980s taught a hard lesson to union workers here: Their biggest enemy was not their boss after all, it was competition from Japan, Europe, South America and nonunion mills in this country. It forced the unions to become more like partners with management. As John Mroczkowski, a local union steelworker leader says, "It was hard at first for our members. They didn't want to give up that antagonism."
But they have to a great degree. Before Timken would agree to invest in a new plant here in the early 1980s, it won an 11-year, no-strike clause from the union. When the LTV Corporation appeared on the verge of liquidating its bar unit here, the union went into partnership with local managers and made an employee buyout, forming Republic and saving the company. Republic has a no-strike contract through 1999.
For years there has been no significant hiring at the steel plants here. The average age of a union steelworker at Republic is nearly 50. "You get older, you get more conservative," said Mark John, a union steelworker. "I'm not going in as a 23-year-old kid with a 62-year-old boss. I'm a 46-year-old guy with a boss my same age. We have a lot more in common."
Even union workers at thriving companies live with fear of losing their jobs. Profits may be soaring but Timken is downsizing, cutting 2,200 people from its work force of 17,000 by the end of 1997. "They call it Accelerated Continuous Improvement, it's supposed to be ways to save costs," said Mr. Mroczkowski, the union leader, "but it seems the main thing they come up with is eliminating jobs."
Growth in Stark County and America is in the suburbs, which tends to favor Republicans. The population of Canton, a Democratic stronghold, has dropped from 110,000 to 84,000 in the last 25 years. There is practically no shopping downtown. At night, city streets are deserted.
Jackson Township, home of the county's biggest mall, has grown from 18,500 to 33,500 in that same period, as subdivisions pop out of cornfields. In Jackson, voters backed Mr. Bush in '92, 44 to 31 percent.
There is new wealth in suburban Stark. A few years ago, Bart Wolstein, a Clevelend developer opened the Estates of Glenmoor, a gated community and country club here with homes starting at $350,000.
People predicted Glenmoor would never sell. Stark is a place where you can still buy a comfortable house for under $100,000. As Mr. Wolstein put it, "The people in Canton sit on a dime a long time."
A consultant told him to charge $12,500 for his country club memberships. "I said, 'Great idea, but you're fired.' I'd just as soon give them away for that." Today, he says, memberships sell for $30,000, there are more than 100 homes built, many for over a $1 million, about 30 percent of them owned by doctors.
There are signs that the poor and working poor here have already been hurt by the early round of Government cuts out of Washington and Columbus and stand to lose more, depending on how Congressional budget negotiations play out.
In the last six months, the Stark County Legal Aid Society has gone from a legal staff of 10 to 6 and expects to shrink to four within two months. That will mean fewer people getting a lawyer for their divorce, custody, abuse and consumer fraud cases. Local charitable organizations provide 229 beds for the homeless, which are full year round. On the coldest nights the Y.M.C.A. downtown, which has 98 rooms, has been setting up extra cots in the lobby.
Larry Martin, who runs the American Rescue Workers mission with 19 beds, says the men have been hurt by Governor Voinovich's welfare overhaul program, which ended General Assistance for single adults without children. The monthly stipend in Ohio was only $100 a month, but Mr. Martin said when combined with $115 in foodstamps that was enough to get a shared room in a boarding house or at a relative's.
Mr. Martin is a Republican and fundamentalist Christian, who admires the Governor but believes Mr. Voinovich was wrong on this issue. He says while some used the $100 on drugs or alcohol, most did not. He says having the money meant they could buy a new shirt for a job interview, gas to keep a car going, hold onto a little dignity. "I wouldn't think it would have saved the state much money," he said.
 
The Religion
Keeping Politics Out of the Pulpit
Church-going is important in Canton. The Canton Baptist Temple, where 2,000 come to pray on Sundays and give generously (a record $173,542.22 for the last Christmas offering) has one of the area's largest congregation. Since 1947, the Rev. Harold Henniger, who founded the Christian Hall of Fame here, has guided the church.
As is true at most fundamentalist churches, the membership selects the minister. One of the things the church's union steelworkers and corporate managers have praised Mr. Henniger for through the years is keeping politics out of the pulpit.
The congregation generally opposes abortion, the one issue a group within the church has been involved with politically. Last fall, when Congress was debating outlawing a particular abortion procedure, several church members made calls to Congressman Regula's office.
There is a small Christian Coalition group in the county, organized after the Republican surge in the 1994 elections. The chairman, Bob Craven, an administrator for a mental retardation agency, says they get 15 to 20 members for monthly meetings. Mr. Craven is most interested in "abortion and morality issues." The only Republican candidate who really excites him is Alan Keyes.
The issue Mr. Henniger hears most about these days is the Republican Medicare cuts. Six days a week at 7 A.M., the minister -- who has not voted for a Democrat for President since Harry Truman -- takes his daily walk with his wife at the Canton Centre Mall. "There's a lot of seniors in there walking," he said, "they're worried about it."

HEADLINE: The Meteoric Rise of Web Site Designers;
Corporations With Cyberfever Demand a Cutting-Edge Presence on Line

SERIES: @WORK: Web site designers

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
Until a year ago, Matt Pacetti, a 25-year-old graphic designer, had never been on the World Wide Web, but now he is the design director of Avalanche Systems, a 30-person agency in Manhattan that has created Web sites for NBC, Elektra records and Super Bowl XXX.
Despite such personal success, unusual for a graphic artist just a few years out of Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, Mr. Pacetti's allegiance to his career is shaky. "The future is very much up in the air," he said. "I think I'll always be in design, but I don't know how committed to Web design I am." 
 Mr. Pacetti's ambivalence is as typical as his nearly overnight rise in the field of Web site development, which has grown by leaps and bounds in the last year as the race to stake a claim to the Internet has riveted the computer industry.
Estimates of the number of sites on the rapidly expanding Web -- the highly popular graphics portion of the Internet -- range from 90,000 to 265,000. Overnight, every business from General Motors to the Schlitterbahn water park in New Braunfels, Tex., seems to have decided it needs a Web site. There might be a total of 16 million individual pages (about one screenful of information each). Someone has to design most of them.
Many are simply the work of hobbyists who have learned to use the Web's basic writing tool, HTML, or hypertext markup language, in a day or two by reading a book. They freelance, selling their services to friends and small businesses.
But increasingly, the demands of corporate clients for on-line versions of magazines or glitzy marketing sites that run hundreds of pages deep require the efforts of a Web team. The group might include graphic designers, writers and HTML authors to assemble pages and "back end" programmers to give sites advanced capabilities, such as updating stock quotes or allowing visitors to download music. Project managers or producers oversee the efforts.
Pioneers in a profession that is regarded variously as a passing fad and a cutting-edge career with a limitless future, Web designers tend to focus on the immediate -- finishing a job, solving a technical problem, creating a dynamic effect by making part of the picture rotate or transform itself into something else. Their resumes tend to be short and varied, their plans vague.
Nathan Shedroff, the creative director of Vivid Studios, a San Francisco company that created the Web site for the debut of Windows 95, said: "We're in the old guard because we've been doing this for more than a year and a half. Right before doing Web design we were doing interface design for on-line services and CD-ROM's. Back further, we did books."
The field has sprung into being so rapidly that no one has managed to count the new jobs created, or the amount of business generated. But Rick Spence, an on-line analyst at Dataquest, a research firm, estimated that at the very least, "tens of millions" of dollars are spent on Web site development annually. Tens of thousands of people are involved. A study by Forester Research found that the cost of creating and running a site for one year ranged from $304,000 for a corporate promotional site, to $1.3 million for an on-line publication, to nearly $3.4 million for a site offering catalogue shopping.
The arrival of big-spending clients has led advertising agencies to set up Web design divisions, and spurred the growth of independent studios.
"The number of new agencies and people with a clue is increasing so fast it's scary," said Kyle Shannon, a founder of Agency.com, a Web design company, and of the World Wide Web Artists Consortium, a 14-month-old professional group with 500 members. It is precisely the speed at which technology and fashions in multimedia change that gives many Web designers a sense of vertigo about their careers.
Everyone remembers when CD-ROM's were the wave of the future -- just two years ago. Venture capital chased small start-up companies. Hollywood discovered Silicon Valley. Then consumers showed a marked indifference to many of the titles, and even multimedia giants like Time Warner Inc. scaled back.
Now the excitement has shifted to the World Wide Web, and every billboard and glossy magazine advertisement trails the obligatory "http" Web address. Some developers worry about a backlash if corporations that have sunk serious money into sites fail to see much in return.
"The big companies will do it as R.& D., to stay current," said Stu Rohrer, a Web producer who began working for commercial on-line services like Compuserve, a unit of H & R Block, in 1982.
"But I predict in the first half of this year a lot of people who did their Web site last year will say, 'That was nice, but let's not do it again.' "
He added, "There's a lot of danger of things drying up for people doing this kind of work."
Peter Seidler, the creative director and co-founder of Avalanche Systems, said that even if the Web's popularity cools, the skills acquired for its design could be upgraded for the next development.
"The ability to conceptualize information and render it interesting in digital form is going to change shape over the next 10 years, but the skills will continue to evolve," he said. "It's a great career move at this point."
Salaries range from no pay, for volunteers trying to learn skills, to $30,000 for a competent HTML author, to $100,000 for a programmer familiar with CGI and Perl, the main computer languages used to connect the Web to data bases.
Josh Bernoff, an analyst at Forester Research, predicted that in each of the next two years, salaries for Web artists and HTML authors would rise 10 percent, and for back-end programmers, 20 percent.
"Talent is so much more in demand than there is supply," he said. "A lot of people think this stuff will fall flat on its face." But he disagrees. "I see vast increases in the amount of useful information on the Web and the amount of people it takes to create and develop that information," he said.
At Avalanche, a 15-month-old studio that is one of the hottest in New York, junior designers and programmers sit at identical black desks with Power Macintoshes, their work surfaces cluttered with empty iced-tea bottles and Sony Discmans. They tend to be in their early 20's, and their life span and that of the personal computer parallel each other.
Mr. Pacetti, the design director, is working on a new look for Pathfinder, the sprawling Time Inc. site. "Right now the site is so visually cluttered people don't know where they're supposed to go," he said. "It's about organizing information, a standard design problem. How to create a flow for someone's eye."
A few seats away, Robin Schuldenfrei, an HTML author, was updating a site for the Summer Olympic Games, hundreds of pages of biographies and press releases that are on line as part of NBC's Web site.
"A lot of what I do is content organization," she said. "The Olympic site is 32 sports. If you want to get the latest you shouldn't have to go six pages into it."
Ms. Schuldenfrei, 23, who graduated from Brown University in June with a degree in art history, worked for a summer during school in the Art Deco and Art Nouveau department at Sotheby's. But she found HTML was her most marketable skill. "I was in the right place at the right time," she said. "The technology was just taking off. If I was at Sotheby's, I'd be faxing and photocopying all day."
It is HTML authors like Ms. Schuldenfrei, however, whose long-term prospects may be most limited. Some new programs bypass HTML and allow anyone to create Web pages. Last month the Microsoft Corporation bought Vermeer Technologies, the maker of the leading automated program, Front Page.
But this month at least, the Web is still a place where Bryant Wilms, 22, of Avalanche can use the computer-design skills he acquired in college to insert a morphed -- combined -- image of Kate Moss and Johnny Depp into a Web site for "Late Night With Conan O'Brien."
Mr. Wilms lives in Brooklyn but would prefer Manhattan if it weren't so expensive. On the other hand, "I practically live here now," he said. "We have some cots in the back."
The computer industry is expected to be a chief engine of job creation in America and abroad over the next decade. Unlike other growth fields -- health care and residential care -- computers are spawning a class of jobs, some new and some transformed. Some, like Web site design, might continue to expand or be part of a bubble that eventually bursts. This is the second article profiling the new workers and their world.

New York Planning Tourism Campaign

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
The New York City Economic Development Corporation has begun a search for agencies to handle advertising and public relations for its initial national and international campaign to promote tourism as well as recruit businesses to the city. Billings were estimated at $10 million. 
 Agencies that specialize in advertising or public relations (or both) will be asked to complete questionnaires, Charles Millard, president of the development unit, said Friday, adding that a maximum of 10 agencies would then be asked to make capability presentations based on responses to the questionnaires. A decision is expected by the middle of spring, he said, and the campaign is scheduled to begin in the fall.

HEADLINE: U.S. Shows China a Worrying Lack of Fortitude

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I look without surprise at the transfer of nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan by the Chinese Government (front page, Feb. 8) and the possibility that the Clinton Administration will waive sanctions. 
 The violation of international and bilateral agreements is to be expected of Beijing. What should not be expected is the willingness of the Clinton Administration, with political cover from pro-China Republicans and Democrats in Congress, to turn a blind eye to the violations.
Beijing has showed time and again that it will risk being discovered breaking various agreements for a chance at more profit. In my work as a human rights advocate, I have uncovered repeated violations of the 1992 memorandum of understanding on prison labor, as products made in the Laogai, or labor camp system, continue to be exported to the United States.
American officials will privately admit they know the Chinese Government is not adhering to the memorandum, but Chinese "compliance" with the agreement gets public lip service from the Administration.
I will repeat what I said when I was released from detention by the Chinese Government last summer: The Communists are liars. They will not follow foreign agreements if they interfere with internal considerations.
The Administration and the "trade-at-all-costs" members of Congress say that increased commercial ties will give us increased leverage with China. It is the Chinese who are exerting leverage over United States policy, as seen by the heavy lobbying against sanctions by companies like Boeing and Westinghouse, which fear having lucrative contracts canceled in retaliation. In the face of a consumer market of 1.2 billion people, many in the business community see only dollar signs as the ultimate gain of China policy.
I hope this Administration and Congress will show some resolve. Only that can re-establish a strong negotiating position with the Chinese. The next time the United States finds itself across the table from the Communist leadership, more than just dollars may be at stake.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Prices Continue to Retreat On Indications of Ample Supply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gold prices dropped yesterday for the fifth time in six days as falling borrowing rates pointed to adequate supply.
On other commodities markets, crude oil prices rose and cotton fell. The Commodity Research Bureau index fell 0.52 point, to 247.50. 
 The one-month rate to borrow gold has fallen every day this month, reaching 1.222 percent yesterday, compared with 3.625 percent four weeks ago. The current rate is the lowest since July.
The drop shows that owners of gold, like central banks, are more willing to lend gold. The lower rates also make it cheaper for mining companies to sell borrowed gold at current prices and replace it with future output from their mines.
"Gold prices are falling because there's ample supply," said Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader with Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. "Investors who have gold holdings are lending it out to the market, and that's showing in the lower lease rates."
Gold for April delivery fell $4.50 an ounce, to $404.50 an ounce, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange -- a 3.5 percent drop from Feb. 2, when the price of $417.70 was the highest for gold in almost six years.
Crude oil prices jumped in the last minutes of trading amid speculation that Iraq and the United Nations might not reach an agreement on an offer that would allow Iraq to export some oil to buy food and medicine.
James Rubin, a spokesman for Madeleine Albright, the United States representative to the United Nations, said there were no "significant developments" in the talks, which were in their fourth day yesterday.
His comments raised speculation among oil traders that Iraq might not agree to the United Nations offer for some time, if at all. The proposal would let Iraq sell $2 billion of crude every six months.
"No one's saying anything," said Tony Lerner, energy trader at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. "That means there's no breakthroughs yet, and that's bullish."
The March crude oil contract rose 19 cents, to $17.97 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Cotton prices fell after the National Cotton Council predicted that this summer's United States cotton crop would rise from last year's, rivaling the record large crop of 1994.
March cotton fell 1.05 cents, to 84.33 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange.

Bond Prices Post Gains; Trading Light

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher in light activity yesterday, as concern seemed to ease about accommodating the huge supply of new debt securities from last week's Government quarterly refunding and as the lack of fresh economic data left traders without strong direction.
The market continues to nibble away at the record $44.5 billion in bills, bonds and notes auctioned by the Treasury last week. But supply is no longer the burden it was then, when bond prices dropped as the market contended with distributing the securities.
The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond increased 29/32, to a price of 99 20/32 yesterday; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, was at 6.03 percent, down from 6.09 percent on Friday.
In recent weeks, the rising price of gold has weighed on the market, but gold prices fell back sharply yesterday -- more than $4 an ounce -- as ample supplies were seen.
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said that rather than being a consequence of any real concerns about inflation, the recent run-up in gold prices was a result of jittery investors looking for alternative investments after the strong gains by both debt and equity securities. Regardless of the causes, the bond market had been distracted by gold's rise.
Jack McIntyre, a market strategist at MCM TradeWatch in Boston, a market research and analysis firm, said that while the bulk of supply of new Treasury issues was out of the way, some dealers were still struggling to sell inventory amassed at last week's refunding. Given the record low interest rates for the securities being auctioned, demand was more than adequate, he said, as foreign investors showed an interest.
Now the market can refocus on economic data and keep an eye on the budget discussions in Washington, which, to Mr. McIntyre, seem to be carrying a more conciliatory tone.
"We are leaning bullish on bonds and taking our cue from the intermediate to shorter maturities," he said. He thinks the market will continue to see a widening of the yield spread between the short and long ends of the market, with the trend lasting through the year.
Technically, he said, the bond market is sound, and he expects prices to move higher in the near term, with the yield on the 30-year bond dropping back to less than 6 percent. If gold should slide below $400 an ounce, Mr. McIntyre said, the bond market could get a substantial psychological lift.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said that while market participation was limited yesterday, it was firm and had its fundamentals intact. The shorter maturities are doing well, he said, on the belief that the Federal Reserve will continue to lower short-term interest rates.
"We see the yield on the long bond at 5.75 percent by March," Mr. Alexy said. "If we're wrong, it will not be because interest rates did not move lower but because of a steepening of the yield curve."
He said that investors still had a great deal of cash to invest and that the dollar was firm. Also, the outlook for economic growth remains weak,Mr. Alexy said.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of bills yesterday, rates declined for the third consecutive week. The auction drew decent demand, with the average rate for a three-month maturity at 4.80 percent, down from 4.88 percent last week, and a six-month rate at 4.71 percent, down from 4.79 percent.
Traders said that while the number of bids was impressive, it might have been helped by the reduced size of this week's auction, which was $27.4 billion, compared with $32.4 billion the week before.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.787	97.619	Discounted Rate	4.80%	4.71%	Coupon Yield	4.94%	4.90%	High Price	98.794	97.624	Discounted Rate	4.77%	4.70%	Coupon Yield	4.91%	4.89%	Low Price	98.787	97.619	Discounted Rate	4.80%	4.71%	Coupon Yield	4.94%	4.90%	Accepted at low price	42%	20%	Total applied for	$51,301,053	$60,778,074	Accepted	$13,815,033	$13,785,170	Noncompetitive	$1,460,498	$1,247,824192	

Both issues are dated Feb. 15, 1996. The three-month bills mature on May 16, 1996, and the six-month bill on Aug. 15, 1996.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Mexico Renews Its Intention To Sell Parts of Oil Monopoly

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Despite growing popular opposition across Mexico to the move, Government officials reiterated their commitment today to selling key pieces of the huge state-owned oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, while hinting broadly that they might limit foreign investment to insure that domestic companies get a chance to participate in the privatized businesses.
At a ceremony this morning at a sprawling oil refinery at Tula, in central Mexico, President Ernesto Zedillo also sharply criticized opposition-party politicians and their followers, who have blocked dozens of oil wells in the gulf state of Tabasco, causing a standoff that the Government says has cost Pemex more than $8.5 million in revenue in the last two weeks. 
 "Nobody has the right to use the nation's energy resources, their exploitation or their utilization for personal reasons, nor as instruments of pressure or for political battles," Mr. Zedillo said at a ceremony to make public a five-year energy-development plan. "The energy resources belong to the nation and ought to be utilized in accordance with the law for the progress of Mexico and the well-being of all Mexicans."
The development blueprint contained no real surprises. But it could send a mixed message to foreign investors, many from the United States, who have expressed interest in bidding on the two parts of Pemex that are being privatized: its secondary petrochemicals and the natural-gas distribution operations.
Changes in Mexican law last year made it possible for those operations to be sold. The rest of Pemex remains "strategically important," and thus reserved for the state.
Investors interested in the 60 petrochemical plants to be privatized over the next few years are likely to be heartened by the strong support Mr. Zedillo gave today to moving ahead with the proposed sales. That support came in spite of huge-scale demonstrations by the oil workers' union and others who do not think that any part of Pemex -- which has taken on mythic proportions here since the oil industry was nationalized in 1938 -- should be sold.
The new energy minister, Jesus Reyes Heroles, said today that private investment was essential to rebuilding the energy industries and said that three bids had already been received for the petrochemical complex at Cosoleacaque, the first facilities on the list to be privatized, though he did not say who the bidders were.
But the newspaper El Financiero reported the Government's concern that foreign investment would have to be limited if it threatened to concentrate ownership in the hands of a few non-Mexican companies.
A former Pemex official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, said the company had discretion to determine which petrochemical plants could be sold only to Mexicans. "The Government would like to give as much advantage as it can to Mexicans," the ex-official said, "but they can't let Mexicans buy the plants for peanuts, so they need some competition,"
A spokesman for the energy ministry would not confirm or deny the newspaper report, but in his speech today, Mr. Reyes Heroles said Pemex should be used as an engine for Mexican economic development. He cited the area of goods and services in the oil industry, which he said should be used "to boost national providers that are willing to participate competitively."
Mr. Reyes Heroles also said that between now and 2000, Mexico's energy industries would need nearly $34 billion in capital, of which $6 billion will have to come from private business and investors.
President Zedillo said that a substantial part of the money from the privatizations would be used to fortify Pemex. Last year, though, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz told officials of the United States Treasury and the International Monetary Fund that the proceeds of the Pemex privatization, as well as the sale of railroads, airports and deep-sea ports, would be used to balance Mexico's budget and reduce its debt.
The blockades of the oil wells in Tabasco state by supporters of the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party continued today. On Sunday, however, the party agreed to allow Pemex crews to enter the grounds of some blocked wells to do maintenance work. The leftist party continues to negotiate with the Government to reach a peaceful solution to the growing conflict.

HEADLINE: In Settlement, Toy Maker to Give Refunds

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The $20 billion United States toy industry showed its happiest face to the world yesterday, announcing record retail sales figures for 1995 at the start of its biggest annual trade show. But the Federal Trade Commission dampened the festivities with the news that it had won its first consumer-refund settlement for deceptive advertising in the toy industry.
The settlement was with the Remco Toys division of Azrak-Hamway International Inc. The F.T.C. had charged that Remco's television advertising campaign for its Steel Tec toy vehicle kits was misleading. The company misrepresented the number of types of toys that could be constructed from the kits and the kinds of things the toys could do, the F.T.C. said. 
 Because of the settlement with Remco, thousands of consumers who bought the toys are eligible for full refunds, the F.T.C. said.
"This is the first F.T.C. toy case where consumers have qualified for a full refund owing to deceptive advertising," said Jodie Z. Bernstein, director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the F.T.C.
As for the industry, which gave a noisy and colorful sendoff to its 93d annual American International Toy Fair in Manhattan, the sales record was a surprise, considering the difficult climate for retail stores. The sales grew nearly 7 percent, to $20 billion, in 1995 from $18.7 billion in 1994, according to the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc., a trade group of 235 manufacturers and importers that sponsors the trade show.
In terms of wholesale shipments, however, the increase was only 3 percent, and "that, allowing for inflation, made it a flat year," said George B. Volanakis, the chief executive of the Ertl Company and the president of the trade group. "We're likely to have the same sort of year in 1996."
The association announced that the strongest-growing segment of the industry was the girls' doll category, which was up 12 percent, to $1.89 billion, at the wholesale level, which amounts to about $2.4 billion at retail. This reflected the popularity of Mattel Inc.'s Barbie doll, which had its biggest retail sales year, at about $1.4 billion.
The big losers among the industry's traditional categories were male action toys, which declined 14 percent, to $795 million, in wholesale sales. Mr. Volanakis said this reflected the decline in popularity of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, which were the sensation of 1993 and 1994.
Another category -- nontraditional but nevertheless huge -- turned in an even poorer year: The video-game segment declined 19 percent, to $2.53 billion, at the wholesale level in 1995. Consumers began waiting "until the next generation of technology became available," Mr. Volanakis said.
The statistics were announced in the Toy Center at 200 Fifth Avenue, marking the opening of the fair, which, for seven days, is bringing together toy makers, retailers, salespeople and Wall Street analysts. The organizers of the fair expect 20,000 buyers from 99 countries, and they signed up 1,619 exhibitors, 30 more than last year. The fair expands to the Jacob K. Javits Center on Friday, where it will run through the weekend.
As in the past, the attendees were met at the portals of the Toy Center with formidable hoopla and hype: The greeters-in-suits included Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, glad-handing giant Smurfs, a grunting green Incredible Hulk and an affable Pink Panther. A teddy-bear maker even brought in a live bear cub to pose for pictures in the frigid weather.
Those attending the fair were also assailed by a self-styled "Toycott": Leaflets were distributed, demanding a boycott of toys made in China. The demonstrators, who represented the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the U.S.-Tibet Committee and other groups, said they were protesting human-rights abuses in China, and they contended that some toys and toy parts were made in that country by political prisoners.
As for Remco, it agreed to settle the F.T.C.'s charges of deceptive advertising, as did Starwood Advertising Inc. of Aspen, Colo., Remco's agency. Consumers may phone Remco at 1-800-243-2961 to receive an application for a refund.
The Remco toys, which cost $9 to $40, were manipulated off-screen in the advertisements by hidden wires or tubes, and "in actual use, the vehicles could not perform as they had in the ads," the F.T.C. complaint said.
Aaron Locker, a spokesman for the advertising agency and for Azrak-Hamway, a privately held company based in Manhattan, said Azrak-Hamway "still thinks that it did not violate the law, but the company did not have the resources to engage in lengthy litigation with the F.T.C." He declined to disclose the company's annual revenues, the number of Steel Tec toys sold or the company's estimate of the eventual cost of the refunds.

HEADLINE: Police Apology Is Offered In Queens Man's Shooting

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC 

 BODY:
The first thing Lebert Folkes says he wants to know is why Police Officer Christopher Strom, a nine-year veteran, shot him after ordering him out of his car in front of his Queens home on Sunday night. Then, he says, he wants to know where to find a good lawyer.
Police officials apologized yesterday for stopping Mr. Folkes's car and apprehending him in the first place, saying a computer error had mistakenly identified the car as stolen. They also acknowledged that Mr. Folkes was shot accidentally after what they said was a struggle to remove him from his car. 
 "Obviously, an error was made by the New York City Police Department," said Deputy Chief Lawrence F. Loesch, the commander of Queens detectives, referring to the department's failure to remove the car's registration number from the log of vehicles reported stolen after it was recovered. "Clearly, we made a mistake."
The chief said the behavior of police officers during the shooting incident would be investigated.
Speaking from his bed at Jamaica Hospital, where he was in stable condition after being shot in the face, Mr. Folkes said he was driving his sister's black 1989 Nissan home from a friend's house at about 8:20 P.M. when a light-colored Buick pulled up behind him on Beach Channel Drive in Far Rockaway.
"I knew that white car," the 29-year-old unemployed Jamaican immigrant said. "I knew it was the police."
Witnesses said the two undercover police officers blocked the front of the Nissan with their Buick before exiting their car, drawing their guns and ordering Mr. Folkes to get out.
Mr. Folkes and at least two witnesses, one standing about 15 feet away, said the policemen did not identify themselves in any way as police officers.
"They didn't flash their badges," Mr. Folkes said. "They didn't say they were the police."
Mr. Folkes said he tried to cooperate and get out of the car, but when he reached to unbuckle his seat belt, Officer Strom pulled him by his jacket out of the car and onto the ground.
"As soon as he pulled me out of the car and I was on my belly with my face down, he shot me straight," Mr. Folkes said.
The police gave a different version of the incident, saying the bullet that wounded Mr. Folkes on the right side of his face was probably fired accidentally from Officer Strom's 9-millimeter semiautomatic service weapon.
"As it stands now, it is an accidental discharge," Chief Loesch said at a news conference yesterday at the 101st Precinct headquarters.
He said Mr. Folkes had refused to get out of his car and physically struggled with the police officers.
"They take him out of the vehicle physically, and a struggle ensues," the Chief said, adding that the lone gunshot rang out as the officer was trying to handcuff Mr. Folkes.
Chief Loesch said that the police officers were wearing their badges on chains around their neck but that he did not know whether they had flashed them or vocally identified themselves when they ordered Mr. Folkes to exit the Nissan.
Before blocking Mr. Folkes's car, Officer Strom and the second undercover officer who was riding with him had noticed that the Nissan had a lock that had been tampered with and called for a routine computer check on the car's registration, the chief said. The officers were informed over the radio that the car, which belongs to Mr. Folkes's sister, Iona Folkes, had been stolen, the chief said.
In fact, the car had been stolen on Jan. 15, he said, adding that Ms. Folkes had informed the police at least three times that it had been recovered the next day. But the police never removed the car from a computer list of stolen automobiles, the chief said.
About two weeks ago, Mr. Folkes had been pulled over by the Nassau County police, who were also mistakenly informed that the Nissan was a stolen automobile, Ms. Folkes said.
"The 101st Precinct apologized," she said.
"Why would he want to shoot me?" Mr. Folkes said. "Why would I resist arrest while they had two guns at my head?
"If he would have just said give me your license and registration, he would have seen everything was perfect.
"I'm going to find myself a good lawyer," he said.

HEADLINE: A Wal-Mart Experiment On Internet

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
In a move certain to accelerate the acceptance of computer-based shopping, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said yesterday that it would begin trials next month of a system for selling its merchandise over the Internet. The Microsoft Corporation will supply the software for the experiment.
"We believe it's a concept whose time has arrived," said David Glass, the president and chief executive of Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark.. Electronic retailing, he said, will "create a tremendous opportunity to serve customers that we don't presently serve or who are limited in time." 
 And if the trials are successful, he said, the company intends to move aggressively to expand the system.
Microsoft has been working with Wal-Mart to develop the software needed to conduct retailing operations on the Internet's World Wide Web. Both companies said yesterday that the alliance was not an exclusive partnership and that Microsoft would not have a financial interest in Wal-Mart's electronic retailing.
Microsoft is developing a product called Merchant Server that requires Microsoft's Windows NT operating system. Merchants would use the server software to create data bases of goods, publish electronic catalogues, handle secure transactions and keep customer records.
A number of other companies, notably the Netscape Communications Corporation and Open Market Inc., make competing software.
Mary A. Modahl, director of new media research at Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., said Wal-Mart's entry into electronic retailing would invigorate a market that has been moribund lately because of slow sales and concerns about privacy and the security of financial transactions.
"I think electronic retailing is heating up right now," she said. "Mastercard and Visa recently came together with a standard for doing secure credit-card transactions, and that has created a sense of optimism. Plus, there is strong growth in the on-line market as consumers continue to sign up."
Neither Mr. Glass nor William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, would estimate the size of the electronic retailing market, either in terms of customers or dollar volume.
"It's easy to over-promise and under-deliver, but we have an opportunity to build a completely different industry," Mr. Glass said.

HEADLINE: Sudan Pays High Price for Ties to Islamic Militants

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Americans no longer occupy the American Embassy here. Every last diplomat left by airplane last week in a protest at what Washington says is the sanctuary that Sudan provides to some of the world's most violent terrorist groups.
The United Nations has set a late-March deadline, with the potential threat of economic sanctions, for the Sudan to surrender suspects wanted in connection with an attempt to assassinate Egypt's President last June. The economy is already in a shambles, Sudan's relations with its neighbors are in crisis, and the country remains hobbled by a long and costly civil war. 
 Here in Khartoum, the dust-choked capital of Africa's largest country, the question now is whether these hardships will be enough to persuade the Islamic military Government that took power seven years ago to reconsider its ways.
"There's a growing sense that something's got to give sooner rather than later," one Western diplomat said, repeating sentiments expressed more guardedly by ordinary Sudanese in a country in which the Government is highly unpopular. "And what Washington and the United Nations have done has added to the sense that things may be coming to a head."
With a per capita income of just $200 and a capital where goats forage for scarce grass even along some central streets, the Sudan would seem an unlikely target for such international attention.
But since it seized power seven years ago, the Government of Lieut. Gen. Omar Ahmed al-Bashir and Dr. Hassan al-Turabi, who heads the powerful National Islamic Front, has become a source of mounting concern to the West as it has transformed this multi-religious country into a strict Islamic state and established close ties with Muslim militants around the world.
And now that the United Nations Security Council has effectively endorsed an accusation that the Sudan has sheltered some of the militants who attempted to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in the Ethiopian capital last June 26, the Khartoum Government is under pressure as never before.
The Sudan has regularly denied harboring terrorists, and it has said it has no evidence that the three suspects wanted in the assassination attempt in Addis Ababa are anywhere within its borders.
In a nationally televised address, the Foreign Minister of the Sudan, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, denounced the recent pressure by the United States and the United Nations as "part of a psychological campaign against Sudan to isolate it in Islamic, regional and international forums."
Sudanese officials reiterated that complaint in interviews here, with some suggesting that it is the country's close ties with Iran that have made it a prime Western target. "Essentially, the direction of this Government is not one that pleases the United States and its friends in this region," said Dr. Abubaker al-Shirgieti, director of the country's External Information Council.
With the Sudanese Army showing no sign of disloyalty, there are few here who suggest that the Government is likely to be challenged soon, despite the mounting pressures in the West.
But with economic problems growing, some diplomats say that the army might be pushed toward a closer partnership with Sadiq al-Mahdi, the Prime Minister whom General Bashir ousted in 1989 in a bloodless coup.
Some diplomats also assert that the Government might even loosen its ties with Islamic militants in an effort to stave off United Nations sanctions and to regain American economic aid, which was blocked in 1993 when the State Department added the Sudan to its list of states that sponsor terrorism.
The current Government has twice before taken limited steps against terrorist groups in response to Western pressure.
In 1994, it expelled to France the notorious terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal. And last fall, faced with charges of involvement in the attempt against the Egyptian President, the Government said it would end a policy that had allowed all Arab passport holders to enter the country without visas, and it dismissed its external intelligence chief, Nafi al-Nafi.
Some Western diplomats here cast doubt on whether those moves were truly significant, describing Mr. Nafi as mostly a scapegoat. But in a country that finds itself increasingly isolated, the diplomats say they have little doubt that the messages from the United Nations and the United States are being weighed.
"There is no question that the United States has a hearing in Sudan," the American Ambassador, Timothy Carney, said in a telephone interview from Washington, where he and many of his staff members arrived late last week after leaving the Sudan. "People listen to us."
The ambassador, who left the Sudan after the State Department warned Americans here of potential terrorist threats against them, is now expected to make regular return visits to the Sudan as a nonresident emissary based in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
The State Department also advised the other 2,100 American citizens who live in the Sudan to consider leaving, but none have accepted a United States offer of free passage, an apparent sign that most regard the warning as overwrought.
For its part, the Sudanese Government has in recent days put on a highly cooperative public face, going as far as to publish newspaper notices appealing to citizens to assist in handing over the suspects wanted in the attempt to kill Mr. Mubarak.
The new cooperation comes as the Sudan is plainly vulnerable, its economy crippled by near-triple-digit inflation and a staggering foreign debt of some $16 billion.
Moreover, its relations with the International Monetary Fund are so strained that it faces the very real prospect of becoming the first country ever to be expelled from the agency, a step that would cut it off from remaining lines of badly needed credit.
At the same time, the Sudan now counts among its enemies at least four of its nine neighbors. Egypt and Ethiopia, furious in their view that Sudan was behind the attempt on Mr. Mubarak, only barely maintain official ties.
Uganda and Eritrea have severed relations and accused the Sudan of trying to undermine their Governments. Late last year, Eritrea even announced that it had turned over the Sudanese Embassy in its capital to the National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella organization of Sudanese opposition groups that have vowed to overthrow the Sudanese Government.
Those tensions have only worsened as the black African rebels in southern Sudan have intensified their 12-year civil war against the Government. The Sudan has accused Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda of providing arms and other support to the mostly Christian and animist guerrillas, who are battling to shake off the longstanding dominance of the Arab Muslim north.
A central question, then, that the Government will likely weigh in the weeks ahead is whether to bow to Western pressure and risk losing the backing of the militant Muslim groups and others who still support it, including the Government of Iran.
To Mounir Sayeed, who as the representative here of the militant Palestinian group Hamas maintains an office under the name Al Aksa Information Center, the answer is evident. "We don't have anything to be afraid of," he said.

HEADLINE: Supply-and-Demand Balance Weakens for Semiconductors

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The semiconductor industry's leading indicator fell sharply in January, a trade organization reported today, providing a disturbing sign that the demand for computer chips is growing more slowly than the supply.
That news is likely to put pressure on technology stocks and could lead to a big selloff on Tuesday. 
 The Semiconductor Industry Association reported that the book-to-bill ratio for the three months that ended in January fell to 0.93, the first time the ratio has dropped below 1.00, or break-even, in five years.
The association issued its report after regular stock trading closed. But in after-hours trading, Intel, the largest chip maker, fell more than $2.50 from its close of $58.2344, while Applied Materials, which makes machinery to manufacture chips, fell $3 from its close of $40.
Semiconductor industry analysts had been predicting a drop from December's level of 1.12 in the book-to-bill ratio, but they had expected the ratio to remain positive, in the range of 1.05 to 1.07.
Indeed, some analysts had said that the industry had left behind the cyclical swings it suffered from in the past. In the mid-1980's, when American chip makers were losing ground to Japanese competitors, book-to-bill ratios below break-even were common.
Instead, the latest numbers indicate that the chip industry may still be just as cyclical as the computer industry, which it supplies.
"The book-to-bill is just catching up with the reality in the end markets," said Rick Whittington, an analyst with the Soundview Financial Group who has predicted a decline in the chip business for some time.
"Pricing has fallen out of bed" for memory chips, the largest portion of the market, he said. "There is too much supply."
The book-to-bill ratio compares the rate of orders to shipments. Thus, a ratio of 0.93 indicates that for every $100 worth of computer chips shipped, only $93 worth was ordered. The last time the indicator fell below 1 was in January 1991, when it hit 0.99.
"I think it's an inventory problem," Thomas W. Armstrong, the president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in a telephone interview. "We had a similar problem in 1991, and it was a one-month blip. As best as I can tell at this time, we are looking at the same kind of thing now."
Mr. Armstrong said the association still expected that the chip industry's sales would grow by 29 percent this year. "This looks like an aberration to us," he said. "Even though we are surprised by the 0.93 ratio, we remain confident about the long-term outlook for the global semiconductor industry. Semiconductors are more pervasive than ever, and the microelectronics content of the average electronics product continues to grow."
Semiconductor orders dropped 16.8 percent, to $4.16 billion, in January, from $5.01 billion in December, which was a record. But orders in January were 16.3 percent higher than the $3.58 billion recorded for January 1995.
Semiconductor shipments rose slightly in January, to a record of $4.47 billion, four-tenths of 1 percent higher than the $4.46 billion recorded in December. Shipments in January were 39.5 percent higher than the $3.20 billion in January 1995.

HEADLINE: Study Examines Race and Justice in California

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Almost 40 percent of black men in their 20's in California are imprisoned or on probation or parole on any given day, a study released yesterday says.
The new study is the latest and the most dramatic in a series of reports in the last few years showing that young black men are being incarcerated at a rate far out of proportion to their number in the overall population. A study last fall, for example, found that nationally one-third of the black men in their 20's were under the control of the criminal justice system. That was an increase from five years ago, when one-fourth of the black men nationwide ages 20 to 29 were incarcerated or on probation or parole. 
 By contrast, yesterday's report said that only 5 percent of the white men in California in their 20's and 11 percent of the Hispanic men of that age group were in the criminal system last year.
Vincent Schiraldi, the author of the study, attributed the high numbers for black men to tougher punishment for the use of crack cocaine than for other drugs; harsh new sentencing laws; the prison construction boom, and poverty, lack of good jobs and poor education in inner cities.
"Conscious or not, it is difficult to imagine the war on crime being waged with this vehemence if middle-class white males were similarly affected," said Mr. Schiraldi, who is executive director of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco, a research and advocacy group.
Mr. Schiraldi predicted that with California's new "three strikes" sentencing law, the number of young black men in prison will only become more disproportionate. He said that one recent survey of 1,000 cases in Los Angeles found that blacks were charged at 17 times the rate of whites under the new law, which provides for automatic life sentences for criminals convicted of three felonies and double the usual sentences for those convicted of a second serious offense.
Willie L. Brown Jr., the recently elected Mayor of San Francisco, said at a news conference yesterday where the report was released, "It doesn't take a genius to realize something is wrong when you look at the numbers."
Blacks make up only 7 percent of the population of California, Mr. Brown said, but they account for 18 percent of those arrested in the state and 32 percent of its prison population. Mr. Brown, who is black, was Speaker of the California State Assembly for 14 years.
Speaking of the new study, Mr. Brown said, "Hopefully this will raise the consciousness of our politicians and the public at large to realize that simply incarcerating everyone will not solve the problems we have."
Criminologists, however, are divided on what the report means.
James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of California at Los Angeles, said that although the figures were very troubling, "if you set aside the arrests for crack cocaine, they are not the result of bias in the criminal justice system."
Most crimes nationwide are committed by young people and by males, Professor Wilson said, and no one argues that the system is biased when it imprisons a disproportionate number of young men.
Instead, the fact that almost 40 percent of young black men are under the control of the criminal justice system "reflects an unhappy fact," Professor Wilson said. "The system is more or less putting people in prison at the rate at which they commit crimes."
He said there was no easy solution except to "try to profoundly change the circumstances of people in their early years of life."
But Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, said that increasingly the disproportionate figures result from the war on drugs, in which the police have focused on the inner city rather than the suburbs because the drug trade there is more out in the open and involves blacks.
"The issue we really have to face is the degree to which we are damning a whole generation of people who are pursuing the only economic opportunity they see, however wrong it is," Professor Blumstein said.
In New York State, about 1 of every 3 black men in their 20's is in prison or on probation or parole, said Robert Gangi, the executive director of the Correctional Association of New York. The rate is higher in California than in New York in part simply because California has just completed a major prison construction program, Mr. Gangi said.

HEADLINE: With Detentions Up, Border Is Still Porous

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: BROWNSVILLE, Tex., Feb. 9

 BODY:
It is a few minutes before midnight, and Fernando Quiroga is crouched in the carrizo cane along the banks of the Rio Grande. The air smells sweet, and the light of a half-moon casts a faint glow on the river.
Mr. Quiroga, a senior agent with the United States Border Patrol, circles like a cat down to the river, suddenly positioning himself between Mexico and a group of 15 Mexican men who have just waded across. 
 "Detenganse!" he shouts, the rough Spanish equivalent of "Freeze!" The Mexicans, most dressed in caps with sports logos like the Toronto Blue Jays, the New England Patriots and Duke University, quickly surrender. They quietly throw their belongings, most wrapped inside plastic grocery bags, into a pile in front of Mr. Quiroga and three other agents.
Detention of illegal immigrants like this have risen in the past year in all the nine Border Patrol sectors along the United States-Mexico border. And the Immigration and Naturalization Service, one of the few Federal agencies to have a large budget increase approved by the Republican-controlled Congress, is hiring 1,000 new agents to patrol the border, a 20 percent increase in the size of the force.
The increase also allows the agency to expand its technical resources, like motion sensors, night-vision devices and a computerized fingerprint file for every detainee.
But a day and a night with Border Patrol agents here in Brownsville, even while offering a glimpse of the new technology at work, offers an even starker illustration of just how porous the border remains. Even Mr. Quiroga estimated that while he and fellow agents were detaining their group of men, another three or four groups of similar size were probably making it across the river uncaught.
The chief of the Border Patrol section in Brownsville, David Aguilar, said increased detentions were deterring only some people from trying to enter the country. With 138 agents, or roughly 46 in each eight-hour shift, to patrol 68 miles of winding riverfront and thousands of square miles between the border and inland checkpoints, the odds favor the immigrant.
"If someone is determined to come across, they're going to make it," Mr. Aguilar said. "What's driving these people is human needs."
A shift with Agent Quiroga was marked by hours of quiet waiting, hours of paperwork to process the detainees, and a few moments of excitement and tension when he confronted a man wading across the mouth of the Rio Grande with $135,000 worth of cocaine and marijuana. The man escaped back to Mexico, but the drugs, which he threw into some bushes, were confiscated.
The night even had flashes of humor. As a spectacular sunset came to Boca Chica beach, near where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico, Agent Quiroga confronted a woman parked in a Lincoln Continental along the shore. He suspected her of waiting to pick up an illegal immigrant. Asked what she was doing, the woman languidly scooped a Chlorox bottle into the salty Gulf water. "Oh, I'm just collecting some water to put on my lawn," she said, before driving off.
"Gulf water for the lawn," Agent Quiroga said, breaking into laughter. "Now, that's a new one."
Most people coming across do not bear drugs and say they are simply looking for work. Interviews with detainees here, virtually all of whom were bused back to the Mexico border town of Nuevo Progreso and some of whom said they would simply try to cross again the next day, also demonstrate how the relatively immense economic opportunities in the United States continue to act as a magnet for those trying to cross illegally.
"I won't lie to you," 34-year-old Jose Aguirre Garcia, from the city of Linares in Nuevo Leon province, told Mr. Quiroga as he was being processed at the Border Patrol center in Brownsville. "I will try to come again tomorrow."
Trying to support a wife and three daughters back home, he said he had earned $2,000 in a few months picking citrus fruit in Florida last year, with no substantial work available in Mexico.
"You're doing your job," he told Agent Quiroga with a friendly laugh. "And I'm doing mine."
And while he had heard that the United States was more hostile to illegal immigrants these days, Mr. Aguirre remained a bit skeptical. "They certainly seemed to welcome my work in Florida," he said.
Baltazar Trinidad Guadalupe, a 21-year-old man from a small town a hundred miles north of Mexico City, said he wanted to get to Houston where his relative say there are plenty of jobs available laying sheet rock. He said: "Yes, I will try it again. I have set a goal. Houston is my goal."
Mr. Trinidad said he believed he could make at least $12,000 in a year's work in Houston, compared with the $1,500 he made this past year doing odd jobs in Mexico.
Dressed in black jeans that were wet to the thighs from his crossing, a faded green shirt and cowboy boots, Mr. Trinidad offered a history that illustrates what immigration officials call the "squeezing the balloon" phenomenon: a successful crackdown in one part of the border often leads to increased efforts at crossing elsewhere.
Mr. Trinidad said he had tried a few times without success to cross at Ciudad Juarez, across the river from El Paso, late last year and had been caught each time. El Paso has had a much-publicized increase in agents and technology in the last year and a half to deter immigration. "I heard it might be easier to get across at Matamoros," Mr. Trinidad said, speaking of the Mexican border city across from Brownsville. "So I came here."
While detentions are up an average of 66 percent all along the border, to 169,463 this past January, from 102,156 in January 1995, they have skyrocketed in a few traditionally less-traveled places in particular: 116 percent in the Tucson, Ariz., sector, 144 percent in Yuma, and 278 percent in El Centro, Calif. Detentions are up 39 percent here in the Brownsville area, and attempted crossings appear to be up as well, Mr. Aguilar said.
Immigration officials say that in time, they hope to "squeeze the balloon" everywhere and make crossing as difficult all along the border as it is in places like El Paso.
And for every person like Mr. Trinidad who is able to travel elsewhere along the border, they say, there may be many other would-be illegal immigrants who give up because the trip to an easier crossing point is too expensive or daunting.
At 4 A.M., Mr. Aguirre and the other men were bused back to Mexico. They had spent four hours in detention, had had their fingerprints loaded into a computerized file and had been advised not to enter the country illegally again.
While the United States says it will eventually try to put repeat offenders behind bars, in most cases it has neither the prosecutors nor the jail space to do so now.
The front line of defense remains people like the green-eyed, mustachioed Agent Quiroga, a 30-year-old native of Laredo, Tex., where he once played middle linebacker for the local high school.
The job has its dangers -- a Border Patrol agent was killed just last month in Eagle Pass, Tex., in a shootout with drug smugglers, and agents on the Arizona border have had shots fired at them at least 10 times in the past six months. Conversely, some Border Patrol agents have been accused of brutalizing immigrants.
But Mr. Quiroga said that for most agents the job is more typically marked by days of relatively uneventful work, often involving detentions of people who say with a shrug that they will come back. He said he no longer even lectures them about not trying again.
"That's a negative," he said. "No lectures. You could turn blue in the face trying to do that. A lot of people say, 'Why are you taking me back? I'm just trying to make a better living for my family. All I want to do is work. Is that such a crime?' "
And Mr. Quiroga is not at all unique among agents when he says that even in doing his job as best he can he is not immune to sympathy for people on the other end of the cat-and-mouse operation.
"In some ways, it's kind of impossible to hold back what's going on," he said. "You talk to these people, you put yourself in their shoes, and you can see exactly what the hell is going on out here. You can understand where they're coming from."

HEADLINE: Facing Foes, Rohatyn Ready To Withdraw As Fed Choice

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Felix G. Rohatyn, the New York investment banker who has lobbied for the No. 2 seat on the Federal Reserve Board, drafted a letter to President Clinton today, withdrawing from consideration after concluding that his nomination would face insurmountable opposition from Senate Republicans, senior Administration officials said tonight.
Mr. Rohatyn faxed a copy of the letter to the White House late today. But President Clinton's chief of staff, Leon Panetta, asked him to put off a formal withdrawal while the Administration tried to strike a last-minute deal on Capitol Hill linking his nomination to the renomination of Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Fed. 
 "Felix Rohatyn unfortunately and for no good reason except politics seems to have prospects on the Hill that are not more than bleak," the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said tonight. He said President Clinton was expected to take the issue up "in a review of the issues at the Fed" on Tuesday.
Reached in New York tonight, Mr. Rohatyn confirmed that he had faxed the White House, asking the President to withdraw his name. "Mr. Panetta asked me to hold off for a day because they were still making efforts," Mr. Rohatyn said, "but I frankly think this is a closed chapter."
The President had been expected to announce the reappointment of Mr. Greenspan, a Republican whom the Clinton Administration concluded was the only candidate who could be confirmed before the Presidential election, this week. It would be Mr. Greenspan's third four-year term.
Mr. Rohatyn, 67, senior partner of Lazard Freres, is known for his role in helping New York City survive its fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. In recent weeks, he has sought to win the vice chairmanship of the Federal Reserve, vacated by Alan S. Blinder. Mr. Blinder resigned to return to Princeton University.
Mr. Rohatyn's first problems were within the Administration itself: Several of Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers, including Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin, were reported to have reservations about his appointment.
Others, though, argued that his views in favor of interest-rate policy promoting economic growth and job creation would be a good counterpoint to Mr. Greenspan's caution and instinct to fight inflation at all costs, even if it meant slower growth.
But the major obstacle came from Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, a member of the Banking Committee and chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. He assailed the views of Mr. Rohatyn, who he said favored a wide range of activist public solutions to economic problems. Mr. Mack, citing President Clinton's recent declaration that the age of big government was over, said of Mr. Rohatyn several days ago: "It would be difficult to find a nominee more at odds with Bill Clinton's rhetoric."
White House officials have been searching for more than a week for members of the Banking Committee willing to support Mr. Rohatyn. But in an election year, few Republicans would go against their leadership.
Mr. McCurry, in a statement earlier today, said he was concerned that the appointment to an independent board like the Fed "is becoming enmeshed in politics." White House officials said they expected the appointment of Mr. Greenspan to go forward, though they did not know if it would be announced only after another candidate for vice chairman had been found.
While names have not been formally presented to Mr. Clinton, the President has been involved in "a number of conversations," a senior official said recently. The recommendations are being made by a group that includes Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the National Economic Council; Mr. Rubin, and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Joseph E. Stiglitz.
Though the relationship between Mr. Greenspan and the White House began as a rocky one, his management of the economy -- keeping inflation low and the recovery continuing, if slowly -- has been widely praised. He supported the bailout of Mexico and the White House strategy to raise the debt limit this year, and he helped silence some Republican critics of the Administration.
Mr. Greenspan's relationship with Mr. Rubin is said to be particularly good, though it was unclear whether Mr. Greenspan had agreed to Mr. Rohatyn's appointment, or sought someone more compatible with his own views. This has become a real problem, an Administration official said tonight, adding, "This is one of those things that's not easy in a normal year, and impossible in an election year."

Computer Chip Orders Post an Unexpected Drop
The semiconductor industry's leading indicator -- a comparison of orders and shipments of computer chips -- fell to an unexpected low in January, a sign that demand for chips is growing more slowly than the supply. The report is likely to pressure technology stocks and possibly lead to a selloff.
The Semiconductor Industry Association reported a book-to-bill ratio for the three months that ended in January of 0.93, the first time the ratio has been below 1.00, or the break-even mark, in five years. Analysts had forecast a drop from December's ratio of 1.12, but not one so steep. [Page D2.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: IN THE PACK;
A Strong Second-Place Gives Heart to Buchanan

BYLINE: By ADAM NEGOURNEY 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Feb. 12

 BODY:
With a focused and conservative appeal, Patrick J. Buchanan gathered the right wing of this state's Republican Party behind him today and did "far better than anyone predicted" -- as he exuberantly put it tonight -- for the third time in this year's Republican Presidential season.
Mr. Buchanan's populist approach, combined with the collapse of the campaign of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, allowed Mr. Buchanan to proclaim himself as the undisputed leader of both social and economic conservatives in the Republican Party as he headed into New Hampshire. 
 "We did well with Christian conservatives," Mr. Buchanan said, fired up. "I'm a religious conservative, too, and they're great people."
Mr. Buchanan's strong showing here was particularly surprising because his advocacy of high tariffs, widely derided by his Republican opponents as protectionist, seemed risky in Iowa because it is heavily dependent on agricultural and manufacturing exports. His sister and campaign chairwoman, Angela "Bay" Buchanan, said the trade issue "works even better for us in New Hampshire." But, that said, Mr. Buchanan might come to remember these weeks as some of the easiest of his Presidential campaign.
Mr. Buchanan had a lot going for him in Iowa. He was able to take advantage of low expectations, and a committed, organized religious community provided him the kind of strong organization that makes the difference in a low-turnout forum like caucuses. His victory in the Louisiana caucuses, and, before that, the Alaska straw poll, gave him a burst of favorable publicity and undercut his principal rival for conservative support, Mr. Gramm.
"I think he was aided tremendously by the collapse of Gramm," said Roger J. Stone Jr, a Republican consultant. "His goals in the final days here were to consolidate social conservatives. He very clearly has done that tonight."
Mr. Buchanan's campaign has never been flush with money, but he has consistently been able to raise money from small contributors. And he might be able to pick off some of the major economic supporters of Mr. Gramm, now that he assumes the mantle of the leading spokesman for Republican conservatives. But the New Hampshire primary is only one week away, which does not give Mr. Buchanan much time to raise money or spend it.
And while Mr. Buchanan enjoys a committed base of support in New Hampshire -- he won 37 percent of the vote when he challenged President George Bush there in 1992 -- he also has a considerable reservoir of enmity among many Republicans there who remember the political damage he inflicted on a sitting President of their party. A poll published by The Boston Globe this week found Mr. Buchanan with 16 percent of the vote, trailing Senator Bob Dole and Steve Forbes.
If history is any guide, Mr. Buchanan's vibrant showing here should help him do better in New Hampshire. But while he has a committed band of supporters, it is a limited one. In Iowa, a third of the voters who went to caucuses described themselves as members of the religious right, and 4 in 10 of the people in that group voted for Mr. Buchanan, according to an entrance poll conducted by the four networks and The Associated Press.
Most political professionals say that despite the strength Mr. Buchanan showed here tonight, his support does not extend to more than 35 percent of the Republican primary voters.
Mr. Buchanan might find that as a serious contender, he is going to be subject to the kind of scrutiny that he has largely escaped.
"It clearly gives Pat a major boost," said Eddie Mahe, a longtime Republican consultant. "But I think the other side of this is his media colleagues are going to start paying attention to him. He's got a free ride until this point. Pat's going to get his day in the sun."
Mr. Buchanan, who has spent this campaign defying the odds, showed no signs of concern tonight. "So I say to my friends in New Hampshire," he said, fairly shouting as he included his wife, Shelley, in his victory speech, "keep the lamps lit tonight. Shelley and Pat are coming home."

Victory Laced With Caution

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Feb. 12

 BODY:
In the quarter-century since George McGovern gained a bit of visibility by finishing a surprisingly close second in this state's nominating caucuses, then little known, Iowa's political voice has grown immeasurably louder. But the message is difficult to understand and often misunderstood.
For all the commotion that surrounds the caucuses -- the millions of dollars and thousands of hours expended by the candidates, the blizzard of television commercials, the invasion of this civilized and amiable state by enough journalists to cover a fair-sized war -- they remain a preliminary. They are Act I, Scene 1 of the yearlong drama of electing a President, not its climax. 
 As of the moment, with only 43 of 1996's days elapsed, fewer than 150,000 of the nation's many millions of Republicans have expressed their views in an official proceeding: 21,000 in the Louisiana caucuses on Feb. 6 and about 100,000 in Iowa.
Not that the candidates are ever shy about claiming victory. Tonight Senator Bob Dole, Patrick J. Buchanan and Lamar Alexander, the former Education Secretary, all staked claims, and no one could call any of them a liar.
It may be, of course, that Bob Dole's victory here will set him on the high road to nomination in August and election in November.
He prevailed here by doing things that should stand him in good stead as the campaign unfolds. He kept cool when polls and scuttlebutt said he was losing ground to Steve Forbes; he kept his sometimes-damaging caustic wit under control, and he built a far more cohesive organization than the one he fielded eight years ago.
He goes into the New Hampshire primary a week from Tuesday with the state's popular governor, Stephen Merrill, deeply committed to his cause, which is another big change from 1988.
But he can draw only limited comfort from history. Edmund S. Muskie, who won the Democratic contest in 1972; George Bush, who won among Republicans in 1980; Richard A. Gephardt, who won the Democratic contest in 1988, and Mr. Dole himself, the Republican winner that same year, all ran into heavy political weather in New Hampshire and never recovered.
Only Jimmy Carter, who in 1976 developed a stealth strategy in this state, organizing meticulously, precinct by precinct, before his rivals noticed, won contested caucuses in Iowa and won the Presidency the following November. He won again in 1980, and his Vice President, Walter F. Mondale, won four years later, but both lost the general election.
Tonight's results provide plenty of evidence that Mr. Dole could falter again. He finds it very hard to stir voters' emotions. His margin here was not large, and in the crucial primaries ahead, he will not benefit from the next-door-neighbor status that benefited him in Iowa. A poll of participants entering the caucuses, conducted by the television networks and The Associated Press, showed that voters cared less about Washington experience and a candidate's prospects of winning in November than about conservative values.
There were also signs here that Mr. Dole has little appeal for those who, unlike the older generation, put relatively little emphasis on the Senator's World War II heroism and consider his long service on Capitol Hill a liability, not an asset. He won a third of the vote among those 45 and older and only about a fifth among those 44 and younger, according to the poll of participants -- a worrisome pattern in a party that is trying to sell itself as the vehicle of change.
One of the two rank outsiders in this year's field, Mr. Buchanan -- a former White House staff member, a writer and a broadcaster, but never an elected official -- sought here to establish himself as more than a protest candidate. Pulling about a quarter of the vote and finishing second, he not only did that but also established himself, for now, as the conservative alternative to Mr. Dole.
He succeeded in attracting and motivating a broad constituency of have-nots, people who feel wronged by the North American Free Trade Agreement, outraged by abortion and threatened by internationalism. He did well among the state's powerful Christian conservatives, capturing four of every ten voters in that group, and among the economically distressed, outpolling Mr. Dole among voters with family incomes under $30,000 a year.
Second-best in Iowa has sometimes proved a bankable political asset. Mr. McGovern parlayed it into the Democratic nomination in 1972, and Mr. Bush showed enough strength in defeating Ronald Reagan in 1980 that he was chosen as his party's Vice-Presidential nominee. But the evangelist Pat Robertson got nothing out of his surprise runner-up status in the Republican caucuses in Iowa in 1988.
Mr. Buchanan's performance was undeniably impressive, although he did as well in some states four years ago in his primary challenge of George Bush.
But unless he can broaden his appeal to include mainstream Republicans, he will go the way of Mr. Robertson and of Father Charles Coughlin and Huey P. Long in the 1930's. Eventually, more conventional and less divisive politicians always find ways, as did Franklin D. Roosevelt in the New Deal, to address the needs of the dispossessed and steal the constituencies of the ultraconservatives.
Many factors, politicians said, played a part in Mr. Forbes's dismal showing. Organization has always counted in Iowa, and he had little, relying almost entirely on his television commercials and phone banks. Some Iowans resented his spending $4 million in the state, and without grass-roots workers to get them to tonight's meetings, those intrigued by his ideas apparently stayed home.
Mr. Forbes failed in his ambition to turn himself from a millionaire publishing mogul into a bona-fide Presidential candidate. Not since Wendell L. Willkie, a utility executive, won the Republican Presidential nomination in 1940 has a businessman made a major splash inside one of the major parties.
Even as his poll numbers soared, Mr. Forbes stuck to his 4-3-2-1 mantra --- fourth in Iowa, third in New Hampshire, second in Delaware and first in Arizona. But others set the expectations for him much higher, so he suffered.
New Hampshire, however, has a quirky political culture that could play into Mr. Forbes's hands. Since Revolutionary days, and especially since the Manchester Union Leader became its dominant newspaper, it has resented taxes more than any other state. Hated taxes, in fact, and rewarded like-minded politicians. That has helped Mr. Forbes's flat-tax plan catch on in New Hampshire, though Mr. Merrill, in ill-documented television commercials made for the Dole campaign, has managed to convince some people that it is a disguised middle-class tax increase.
Then, too, organization usually counts for much less in New Hampshire and in other primary states.
The most disappointed man in Des Moines tonight must have been Phil Gramm of Texas, who launched his campaign a year ago with an impeccably conservative record, endless energy and plenty of money. But in the event he proved too clever by half, as the British like to say about those who outsmart themselves.
He predicted victory in Louisiana, but he did not campaign much there in the last ten days, choosing to concentrate on Iowa. Then when Mr. Buchanan ambushed him in the bayous, his support here started to dry up. By playing footsie with Delaware, which is staging its primary on Feb. 24, thus violating the unwritten agreement that no other primary takes place for at least a week after New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, he alienated both Governor Merrill and the Union Leader. Otherwise, he might have had the valuable backing of both.
All along, Mr. Gramm said there would be "only three tickets out of Iowa," meaning that only the top three candidates would survive the caucuses. In historical terms, he was right. No fourth-place finisher has gone on to win the nomination. If that rule is broken this year, Mr. Gramm seems unlikely to be the man to break it. His campaign has gained no momentum in New Hampshire; he had counted on momentum from Iowa to carry him forward there.
The hardest to figure is Mr. Alexander, the piano-playing man from Tennessee, who campaigned for months in his red plaid shirts without generating anything resembling a groundswell, then caught on a bit this week. He was a big winner in the expectations game, but how much further he can go is unclear.
"I think that what we're going to have coming out of Iowa," he had said on Sunday, "is a weak Dole, a falling Forbes, a rising Buchanan and a rising Alexander, and of that field I'm the most likely to be nominated."
What he predicted almost happened, and he was clearly delighted by his showing, which was far stronger than the pundits or polls had predicted.
But anyone who watched the underwhelmed audiences drawn by most of the candidates in the last week of the campaign, and the cheering mobs that turned out to hear President Clinton, can only speculate about might-have-beens.
Sure, Mr. Clinton's events were artfully and expensively staged. Sure, the Presidency has a special glamour. But the Republicans will have to overcome those things in the fall if they are to win, and many of them wondered this weekend whether Gen. Colin L. Powell or Jack F. Kemp or William J. Bennett or one of the many others on the long list of noncandidates might have struck a spark in Iowa.

HEADLINE: BLOOD AND OIL: A Special Report.;
After Nigeria Represses, Shell Defends Its Record

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: YORLA, Nigeria

 BODY:
When members of the Ogoni people began attacks three years ago on Royal Dutch/Shell's oilfields in Nigeria, the company appealed to the country's military Government for protection.
The results, senior company officials now acknowledge, were utterly disastrous. 
 To crush the unrest by the Ogoni, who complained of environmental damage to their territories and demanded money for the oil extracted there, Nigeria sent its notoriously brutal "mobile police" and mounted a campaign of repression that included laying waste to whole villages.
Last November the military Government of Gen. Sani Abacha executed the most prominent Ogoni, Ken Saro-Wiwa, after he was found guilty of inciting a riot that led to the killing of four pro-Government chiefs. His trial was widely condemned as a sham in Europe and the United States.
Now, Royal Dutch/Shell is on trial in the court of public opinion. Critics here and abroad accuse the company of colluding in the brutal oppression of local people, of polluting Ogoniland and of failing to speak out against the execution of Mr. Saro-Wiwa.
Several countries, including the United States, are contemplating sanctions against Nigeria. A coalition of human rights and environmental groups is planning a worldwide boycott of Shell's gasoline and other products.
Even London's Royal Geographic Society, not usually the most militant of groups, has dropped the company as a patron and returned a $60,000 donation.
The Saro-Wiwa case has set off a debate reminiscent of the one over economic relations with South Africa before majority rule. Some critics of the Nigerian Government say that by refusing to cooperate with it, companies like Shell could hasten the return of democracy, or at least avoid complicity with corruption and denial of human rights.
An examination of Shell's actions in Nigeria, assembled from interviews with officials of Shell and the Nigerian Government as well as dissidents and human rights groups abroad, from separate tours of Ogoniland with officials and dissidents, and from a review of official and corporate documents, brings out these broad points:
*Although Mr. Saro-Wiwa has been widely portrayed as a gentle, pipe-smoking eco-martyr, he was a far more complex figure, an ambitious -- Ogoni political rivals say ruthless -- leader. His movement focused on ecological protection after calculating that this would have appeal in the West, but its main goals were to win the region autonomous power and a share of its oil revenues.
*Nigeria's leaders saw the Ogoni movement as a step toward separatist war, like the fierce conflict over the Biafra region in the 1960's. The response was ferocious. One internal Nigerian Army memo outlining the Government's strategy called for the "wasting" of "leadership cadres, especially vocal individuals."
*Shell gave Nigeria an important pretext for violence when it specifically asked the Government to send the mobile police -- known locally as the "kill-and-go mob." Shell paid for the transportation and salary bonuses of some troops -- ostensibly oilfield guards -- who committed the abuses.
*There is evidence of significant pollution in the region in which Shell has pumped oil, but it is not as dire as portrayed by Shell's critics. A 1995 World Bank study concluded that while the pollution angers local residents, the impact on human health "is not expected to be substantial." The report added that "given the low environmental and health impacts, the actual future benefits of reducing oil pollution are low."
*Shell, despite the urging of Western diplomats, declined until the last moment to lend its voice to the international campaign for clemency after Mr. Saro-Wiwa was convicted of murder in a secret and clearly rigged trial. But it is far from clear that Shell's influence would have saved the writer and fellow activists hanged with him.
Shell officials fervently deny doing anything more than trying to protect company personnel and equipment and say they had no control over the actions of the Nigerian security services. They said it was not unusual for companies seeking protection to pay transportation costs and salary supplements for troops living outside their barracks. "We were not there," said Egbert Imomoh, Shell's top manager in Port Harcourt. "We don't know what happened."
Shell officials say they have begun a major study to assess environmental damage in the region. But senior company officials said Shell's image had been dealt a serious blow by the events in Nigeria.
"Saro-Wiwa's execution was a disaster for us," said Alan Detheridge, Shell's West African coordinator.
Nonetheless, the company brushes aside suggestions that it should pull out of Nigeria, or at least freeze the $3.8 billion natural gas project it is pursuing there. The World Bank announced soon after the executions of Mr. Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists that it would not proceed with negotiations to provide money for some of the project.
"All we can pull out are our 270 expatriate staff," said Mark Moody-Stuart, one of four managing directors of Royal Dutch/Shell, in an interview in his London office. "The Nigerians can run the oil industry on their own and buy help on the market," he said, adding that "the French would replace us in a flash."
 
The Roots
Big Profits, Political Rivalry
For nearly four decades Shell has been pumping oil in Nigeria's delta region, to its own enormous profit, and to the benefit of Western countries that have been ready customers. Shell produces roughly half of Nigeria's oil, a commodity that accounts for some 90 percent of the country's foreign exchange and a steady stream of revenues for Nigeria that have often been siphoned off by corrupt officials.
The operations are strategically important to the company, which lacks enough reserves of high-quality crude to meet the requirements of its refineries and gasoline stations. Shell takes for itself 257,000 barrels of the 900,000 barrels the company pumps daily, giving Nigeria the rest.
Nigeria is also lucrative for Shell. Nick Antill, an analyst with the London securities house Barclays de Zoete Wedd, puts Shell's Nigerian profits at $170 million to $190 million a year. "That's nearly 10 percent of total exploration and production profits, which is significant," he says.
Little, if any, of these profits trickled down to Ogoniland.
The Ogoni campaign against the company began in 1990 when a group of conservative traditional leaders formed the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People to win statehood, more money and better environmental protection for the Ogoni. Garrick B. Leton, a former federal minister, became the first president. Mr. Saro-Wiwa, then 49 and a successful writer and TV producer, was appointed spokesman.
The movement persuaded the Government to create an Oil and Minerals Producing Areas Development Commission to channel money to these regions, with an initial promise it would get 3 percent of Nigeria's $10 billion annual oil income, later raised to 13 percent.
But Mr. Saro-Wiwa favored a more confrontational approach to Shell and the federal Government, Mr. Leton said in an interview at his spacious Port Harcourt house. And the two men fell out in a dispute over tactics tinged with class rivalry and personality differences.
The movement was founded by "rich traditional leaders with big houses in Port Harcourt," said Botom Mitee, a supporter of Mr. Saro-Wiwa whose brother was also tried for murder but acquitted. But Mr. Saro-Wiwa, though he had grown affluent during his years as a local administrator and trader, "identified with poor Ogoni in the villages."
Against its official leaders' wishes, Mr. Saro-Wiwa set up new branches of the group under his control, including a youth wing called the National Youth Council of the Ogoni People. Leadership of this group won Mr. Saro-Wiwa a following among Ogoni impatient with traditional leaders. But Mr. Leton said the group became Mr. Saro-Wiwa's "private vigilante army."
At Mr. Saro-Wiwa's urging, the movement demanded $10 billion in oil royalties and enviromental compensation from Shell and the Government in December 1992.
Shell attributes Mr. Saro-Wiwa's success in gradually taking control of the movement and radicalizing it to the continuing poverty of the Ogoni, as promises of more federal aid never materialized. Most villagers still lack even electricity and piped water. For this, Shell blames the Government.
In 1992 Mr. Saro-Wiwa allied the Ogoni movement with the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, a group based in The Hague that strives to give minority groups access to international organizations. He carried his campaign to the United Nations and canvassed support in Europe and the United States. He designed an Ogoni flag, wrote a national anthem and began signing his letters as "president and spokesman of the Ogoni people."
The struggle for control of the Ogoni movement between its traditional leaders and Mr. Saro-Wiwa came to a head in June 1993 over his plan to draw attention to the Ogoni plight by boycotting a Nigerian presidential election that was supposed to mark the country's return to democratic rule.
Mr. Letun and other founding fathers of the movement opposed the boycott, were outvoted and resigned, allowing Mr. Saro-Wiwa to take over the group's presidency.
Mr. Saro-Wiwa's campaign against Shell and the federal Government angered Nigeria's military leaders, who said they feared he was stirring up secessionist feeling in the oil-rich east, 20 years after Biafra's unsuccessful breakaway bid.
 
The Violence
Countercharges And Confusion
In late 1992 Shell asked the Government to send troops to protect its operations from recurring vandalism. But dismayed by continuing vigilante attacks and the ferocious crackdown, Shell withdrew from the region in early 1993, asking the authorities to protect the installations left behind.
The violence continued. Soon after Shell left, an oil pumping station here was set afire and destroyed, and the other four stations in Ogoniland were damaged. Ogoni leaders and the military accuse each other of being responsible. The blazing oil left behind a landscape of charred trees and blackened earth. Even today, nothing grows.
The next year, according to an internal memo obtained by Nigerian dissidents, the company specifically asked the military Government to deploy its mobile police.
What happened in those months of upheaval is a matter of deep dispute.
The Government, in its official account, asserts that vigilantes with ties to Mr. Saro-Wiwa's youth group spearheaded attacks against Shell installations and murdered 40 Ogoni opponents.
Mr. Saro-Wiwa's brother, Owens Saro-Wiwa, and a report by a delegation from the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization to Ogoniland in Febuary 1995 give very different accounts of these incidents. Owens Saro-Wiwa acknowledges that vigilante lawlessness existed in 1993. But he says most of the vandalism was carried out by soldiers, who stole generators and corrugated iron sheets for profit during their campaign against the Ogoni.
Internal military documents show the Government hoped that by crushing the Ogoni protests it would persuade Shell to resume operations in the region. In May 1994 the commander of an internal security task force, Maj. Paul Okuntimo, wrote to his superior, Lieut. Col. Dauda Komo, the Military Administrator of Rivers State, which includes Ogoniland. The message, later obtained by dissidents, said "Shell operations still impossible unless ruthless military operations are undertaken."
It called for "wasting targets cutting across communities and leadership cadres, especially vocal individuals." It detailed special allowances for the troops and suggested applying "pressure on oil companies" to help pay the costs of the operation.
Owens Saro-Wiwa estimates that the attacks largely destroyed about 30 Ogoni villages, killing some 2,000 people, although there is no independent verification.
By then Shell had already abandoned its operations in the region, declaring that it was unwilling to work in conditions of civil unrest and military oppression. Mr. Detheridge, Shell's West African coordinator, said the company would not return "until we have the local community on our side."
On May 21, 1994, Nigerian security forces detained Ken Saro-Wiwa in the Gokana region of Ogoniland while he was campaigning for election to a constitutional conference and took him to Port Harcourt.
The Government says Mr. Saro-Wiwa told his youth supporters, in a statement that included a reference to the paramount chief's meeting place:
"The vultures who connived with the security forces to stop me from addressing you are now meeting at the Gbenemene's Palace Hall in Giokoo sharing money sent them by the federal Government in an effort to thwart my bid for the constitutional conference. Go to the meeting place and deal with the vultures."
His supporters say Mr. Saro-Wiwa never made that statement, though they concede that he used similar language several months earlier.
According to the Government, a crowd of several hundred Ogoni youths attacked the small meeting hall where chiefs and elders were gathered, massacring four with rakes, iron bars, stones and planks.
Today the slain chiefs' blood is still splattered on the walls and floor, which is littered with stones and chunks of concrete used to crush their skulls. The burnt-out remains of two of their cars are slowly being swallowed up by vegetation outside.
The four murdered men -- Albert T. Badey, a former secretary to the state government, Chief Edward Kobani, Chief Samuel M. Orage and Chief Theophalos B. Orage -- were on a list of 10 "vultures" that Mr. Saro-Wiwa made public the previous October because of what he said was their opposition to his agressive campaigning for Ogoni rights against Shell.
The Government insists that Mr. Saro-Wiwa and eight others incited the murders. Mr. Saro-Wiwa's supporters say the killing was done by Government agents to incriminate the Ogoni leader.
What few outside the Nigerian Government disagree about is that Mr. Saro-Wiwa's trial was a travesty, its outcome preordained and his sentence more a reflection of Nigeria's harsh politics than any judicial process.
Mr. Saro-Wiwa was tried before a mixed military-civilian court with no right of judicial appeal. Two prosecution witnesses later retracted evidence and said the Government bribed them. Mr. Saro-Wiwa was hanged on Nov. 10. Nineteen more Ogoni are awaiting trial for the same killings.
 
The Responsibility
A Lost Cause From the Start?
Critics of Shell contend the company has considerable influence over the Nigerian Government and could have done much more to prevent the hanging. The company disputes both assertions.
Initially, when Mr. Saro-Wiwa was put on trial, Shell refused to intervene with the Nigerian authorities, saying "the company does not get involved in politics."
In a statement issued last Oct. 31, after Mr. Saro-Wiwa was sentenced to death, Shell acknowledged that it was being pressed to use its influence to secure clemency but declined to do so, saying, "It is not for commercial organizations like Shell to interfere in the legal process of a sovereign state such as Nigeria."
The company also implicitly accused Mr. Saro-Wiwa of supporting violence, saying in a statement at the time of sentencing that while the Ogoni movement claimed to be nonviolent, "this is not our experience."
Shell's stance brought protests from Mr. Saro-Wiwa's friends. And on Nov. 2 the company issued a new statement that omitted the accusation of abetting violence. But it expressed no regret at the death sentences and again refused to intervene.
Only after Mr. Saro-Wiwa's appeal for clemency had been denied did Shell's chief executive officer, Cor Herkstroter, fax General Abacha requesting a pardon.
Mr. Detheridge insists that Shell's relationship with Nigeria has to be based on business considerations, not political ones. "We can offer advice and we can point out the consequences of an action," he said. "But we do not lecture or try to give orders because we do not interfere in politics and government."
Owens Saro-Wiwa says he met three times during the trial with Brian Anderson, Shell's top executive in Nigeria. He quoted Mr. Anderson as saying it would be "difficult but not impossible" to get his brother freed, provided the Ogoni movement called off its campaign against the company.
But he said his brother refused this offer, replying that the campaign against Shell would end once he was free and the company agreed to negotiate with the movement. Mr. Anderson then broke off contact with him, Owens Saro-Wiwa says. In a videotaped interview issued by Shell, Mr. Anderson denies ever having made such an offer, but confirms that he met with the condemned man's brother.
Britain and the United States privately urged Shell to help save Mr. Saro-Wiwa. Mr. Moody-Stewart of Shell said, "Of course we pointed out to Nigerians the risk of sanctions."
On Nov. 8, the day General Abacha rejected Mr. Saro-Wiwa's clemency plea, President Clinton's special envoy to Nigeria, Ambassador Donald T. McHenry, urged executives of American companies with interests in Nigeria to apply one form of leverage that he thought might work: to explain to Nigeria's leaders that carrying out the executions could invite international sanctions.
While Mr. McHenry says he does not know whether the companies followed his advice, some of them, including the American oil companies Mobil and Chevron, say they did warn their partners about the international repercussions of proceeding with the hangings.
American and British diplomats in Lagos as well as a senior Nigerian diplomat said the campaign to save Mr. Saro-Wiwa never had much chance. The military, they said, was adamantly unwilling to bow to foreign pressure a second time so soon after General Abacha spared the former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo from execution for conspiracy in May.
"The military are a macho bunch," said the Nigerian diplomat. "They couldn't give way a second time. The two incidents were too close in time. If they had been further apart we might have saved him."
 
The Pollution
Low Standards, A Few Regrets
Sitting in his comfortable top-floor office at Shell Center on the south bank of the River Thames with 17th-century naval paintings on the wall and a view of the Houses of Parliament, Mr. Moody-Stuart said he was not sure whether anything could have been done to avert the hanging. But he does says the whole crisis in Ogoniland could have been avoided.
"What I regret is that we did not launch our Niger River Delta Environmental Survey six or seven years ago," he said. He added that if there had been an agreed analysis and action program when the Ogoni movement was founded, "it would have taken a lot of heat out of Ken Saro-Wiwa's campaign."
Shell is now setting up such a commission, at a cost of $4.5 million, to assess the delta's environmental needs. But the project is off to a shaky start. In November Prof. Claude Ake, a representative of the delta communities, resigned in protest at the executions and because he doubts the commission's impartiality.
Ogoni activists like to describe how, after four decades of oil pumping, their 400-square-mile ancestral land is host to 96 oil wells and five big pumping stations, where vast quantities of natural gas are burned 24 hours a day, dirtying the air and lighting up the countryside.
They complain of leaky oil pipes crisscrossing their land and hindering farming. They complain, too, of frequent oil spills that destroy crops and pollute the creeks where the Ogoni fish.
While calling this an exaggerated picture, Shell concedes that environmental standards at its oilfields in the Niger delta are lower than in Europe or America.
"It's a question of priorities," said Dick van den Broek. "Nigeria is a poor country. How much should it spend on enviromental protection?" As majority partner, the Nigerian Government must pay 55 percent of all environmental spending, Shell points out, and it has been reluctant to sacrifice profits for costly environmental protection.
Mr. Saro-Wiwa indicated a keen awareness of the international political appeal of environmental issues in his last book, "A Month and a Day: A Detention Diary," saying of a visit to America: "What that trip did was to convince me that the environment would have to be a strong plank on which to base the burgeoning Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People."
Neither Shell nor the Nigerian Government has conducted a comprehensive environmental impact study of its operations in Ogoniland or elsewhere in the Niger delta.
A 1995 World Bank study, "Defining an Environmental Strategy for the Niger Delta," concludes that while the oil industry has caused environmental damage, "oil pollution by itself is of moderate priority when compared with the full spectrum of environmental problems in the Niger Delta." Many of these, it says, stem from a fourfold population rise since 1958. The study cited oil leaks into the delta waters, saying they indicate "poor or no treatment of effluents" by Shell and other oil companies.
Many Ogoni leaders say their main complaint is poverty.
"Backwardness is what is wrong with us," says Charles Kpakol, chairman of the Gokana local government council, one of three Ogoni regional authorities. While appointed by the Government and opposed to Mr. Saro-Wiwa's Ogoni movement, he is still critical of the federal Government for spending too little in Ogoniland.

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Tuesday with an article about accusations that Royal Dutch/ Shell had condoned a Nigerian Government crackdown against members of the Ogoni people misstated the volume of Nigeria's oil production. It is 1.8 million barrels a day, not 1.8 billion.
An article on Feb. 13 about the role of Royal Dutch/Shell in Nigeria misstated actions of the Royal Geographical Society in London. While some of its members urged the society in January to sever its links to Shell as a corporate patron, the society has not broken ties or returned any Shell donations.

Goodbye Santo Domingo, Hello Manhattan

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Underneath its sugar coating, "Nueba Yol," a comic fable about a young Dominican widower who visits New York City and discovers it is not the paradise paved in dollar bills that he had imagined, offers a fairly hardheaded dose of urban reality. At almost every turn, Balbuena (Luisito Marti), a happy-go-lucky Dominican Everyman who mortgages his house in Santo Domingo to buy a visa, finds his boundless good will either ignored or exploited by others.
To its credit, "Nueba Yol" (Dominican slang for New York), is neither a downbeat story about an innocent dreamer consumed by the plagues of poverty and drugs nor a rags-to-riches fantasy. To audiences in the Dominican Republic, where it has been a smash hit, the movie offers a comforting message: there's no place like home. 
 The movie, which was produced, written and directed by Angel Muniz, is a crude but engaging combination of humorous star vehicle, social-realist commentary and lighthearted farce. For more than a decade, Balbuena has been one of the most popular characters on Dominican television. And at times the movie feels like an episode of a sitcom that might be called "Balbuena Goes to Manhattan." Unlike his Pollyannaish counterparts on American television who would be ridiculed as naive chumps, Balbuena is someone whose genuine friendliness and trust in others are huge assets.
Unable to speak English and lacking a green card, Balbuena finds it almost impossible to find work even as a dishwasher. He is repeatedly menaced by suspicious drug dealers who don't recognize him from the neighborhood. Everything from the mechanics of unlocking an apartment door to finding his way around on the subway becomes a potential crisis.
At the same time, Balbuena faces resentment in his cousin's already overcrowded household. He is despised by Pedro's teen-age children, who are embarrassed by their Dominican origins. One family quarrel becomes so overwrought that Pedro collapses from the stress.
For all the dangers and obstacles it throws in his path, "Nueba Yol" shares Balbuena's faith in the kindness of most strangers (except for drug dealers). He finds romance with an attractive woman (Caridad Ravelo) and a tentative economic foothold working in a Mexican restaurant.
"Nueba Yol" is absolutely clear about what it takes to make a better life in New York or anywhere else. Luck, pluck and hard work are the way, and beware of shortcuts.
"Nueba Yol" is unrated.

HEADLINE: At the Nation's Table: Austin, Tex.;
Elegant Variations On the Empanada

BYLINE: By Anne S. Lewis 

 BODY:
For Ash Corea there is no such thing as a simple empanada. The savory half-moon-shape turnovers indigenous to Latin America are typically stuffed with meats, fish or poultry. But at Ms. Corea's Empanada Parlour in Austin, Tex., she experiments with fillings like sweet potato seasoned with cilantro pesto, and turkey, bok choy and peas spiked with curry powder.
For two years, Ms. Corea, 47, a graduate of the Cordon Bleu Cooking School in Paris, has been delighting empanada aficionados with the spicy, savory and sweet empanadas that she serves at her small downtown storefront and sells wholesale to grocery stores. 
 Ms. Corea was raised in London and has worked in the food business on and off for the 16 years that she has lived in the United States. She became interested in empanadas as a caterer in New York City in the 1980's, when she noted the popularity of stuffed savory pastries. And it wasn't that she set out to experiment with the Latin turnovers; she was really trying to improve the bland Cornish pasties of her London youth.
"Those deadly boring pies filled with cubed beef, peas and potatoes," she recalled with a laugh and a toss of her dreadlocks. "They never saw a trace of garlic, pepper or herbs!"
Ms. Corea, her three partners and their staff bake 12 varieties of at least 600 empanadas a day. "These pies are the perfect fast food," she said. "They're low in fat, economical and -- with all the filling possibilities -- interesting to people who take food seriously."
They're $1.50 each. Ms. Corea's customers eat empanadas for snacks, pick them up on their way to work in the morning, like bagels, and take them home at night for meals. The Empanada Parlour, which is in a downtown storefront, has 10 tables and seats about 40 people. The menu includes a few soups, salads, sandwiches and a daily special. Prices range from $3.50 for soup to the daily special at $5.99.
The response here in the Texas capital has been gratifying, even though Ms. Corea acknowledges that when she began, few of her customers had any idea what an empanada was. "At first I got a lot of skeptical, 'Oh, those are just healthy fried pies!' -- even though they were so obviously baked."
The Empanada Parlour is at 500 East Fourth Street, Austin, Tex. 78701; (512) 480-8902. It is open Monday through Saturday, from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. ANNE S. LEWIS

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mixed as the Mark Attracts Most of the Attention

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Political and economic uncertainty in Europe drove traders to the safety of the German mark yesterday, leaving the dollar mixed against major currencies.
The dollar was down against the mark and up a fraction against the Japanese yen after a day of choppy, thin trading. 
 Most European currencies also showed losses against the mark, which strengthened on signs of steady interest rates in Germany and repeated denials that France and Germany would form their own monetary union.
John Rothfield, an international economist at the Chicago office of Nationsbank-CRT, said that the dollar was down because the mark rose and not because traders dumped dollars.
"People are saying that this stall in the dollar rally isn't a change in sentiment against the dollar," he said.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 1.4730 marks, down from 1.4764 on Monday. It was quoted at 106.81 yen, compared with 106.80 the day before. The British pound rose to $1.5367 from $1.5290.
The mark strengthened after German central bankers indicated that they might not be ready for another cut in interest rates despite economic data showing a slowdown in their nation's economy, the largest in Europe.
A member of the Bundesbank's policy-setting committee, Ernst Welteke, was quoted by a German financial daily as saying that the central bank would maintain interest rates until further data on the money supply become available in March.
The president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, called again for economic union and a single currency. He also said that creating the union was more important than sticking to the 1999 start-up date.
Lisa Finstrom, a senior currency analyst at Smith Barney Inc., said "we'll just have to wait" until Bundesbank officials moved more decisively. Traders, however, did not wait as they bought more marks.
The French franc fell against the mark as the Prime Minister of France, Alain Juppe, again denied speculation that Germany and France would link their currencies rather than join a broader European union.

HEADLINE: The Economics of Never-Never Land

BYLINE: By Paul R. Krugman; Paul R. Krugman, professor of economics at Stanford, is the author of "Peddling Prosperity" and "The Age of Diminished Expectations."

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
I sometimes wish that I could bring myself to have faith in supply-side economics. True believers like Steve Forbes live in a never-never land in which there are no hard choices or painful tradeoffs, budget deficits will be cured by growth and poverty will vanish as the rising tide lifts all boats. Alas, like the great majority of grown-up economists, I just cannot manage the necessary suspension of my critical faculties.
Supply-side economics can be defined as the belief that cutting taxes produces an explosion of economic growth. Yes, most economists agree that taxes are a drag on the economy. But supply-siders insist that the payoff from lowering rates would be vastly larger than others think plausible. 
 Mr. Forbes promises that he can cut almost everyone's taxes without increasing the budget deficit; a Congressionally appointed panel tells us that switching to a flat tax would double the economy's growth rate.
Why does anyone listen to such extravagant promises? Many people accept supply-side nostrums simply because, like the victims of telemarketing scams, they have not learned that a deal that sounds too good to be true probably is. But for those who demand some evidence, the supply-siders continually return to what they regard as the clincher: the supposed economic miracle of the 1980's, in which Ronald Reagan's tax cuts were followed by simultaneous declines in inflation and unemployment.
But mainstream economists have never found the experience of that decade at all mysterious. The conventional wisdom in 1979 held that bringing inflation down would require a prolonged period of high unemployment. That is exactly what happened: The unemployment rate, which had been 5.8 percent in 1979, averaged 7.5 percent during the eight years of Mr. Reagan's Presidency. (It rose rapidly to almost 11 percent during his first two years in office, then declined gradually thereafter, not returning to 5.8 percent until 1988.) Why should anyone be surprised that inflation was lower when he left office than when he entered it?
Mr. Forbes and many others seem to be confused about the difference between the level of unemployment and its rate of change. Anyone who paid attention in Economics 101 knows that inflation normally declines if the unemployment rate is high, even if that rate is falling. Yet the supply-siders insist that something miraculous must have happened after 1982 because employment rose and inflation fell at the same time.
Imagine an overweight person going on a severe diet, beginning with a starvation ration of 800 calories a day and gradually increasing his intake to a somewhat healthier 1,500 calories. Would it be a refutation of conventional dieting theory if the person continued to lose weight as his meals grew larger? Well, substitute jobs for calories, inflation for weight, and you have the fuzzy logic behind the legend of Reaganomics.
The tragedy is that just last year Congressional Republicans seemed to have come to their senses, returning to old-fashioned, tight-fisted conservatism. Despite Mr. Forbes's fourth-place showing in Iowa, the Republican nominee, whoever he is, will probably run not on the theme of fiscal responsibility but on a Reaganesque program of tax cuts. Such a program would promise growth, but it would deliver new and bigger deficits.
Although Bob Dole has attacked Mr. Forbes's flat tax, he has also famously offered to be "another Ronald Reagan, if that's what you want." But unlike Mr. Reagan in 1980, a newly elected President Dole would find a Government already deeply in debt. Worse yet, the day is approaching when the baby boomers will start to retire and claim the trillions of dollars in Social Security and Medicare benefits they have been promised.
It may be pleasant to imagine that we could fly away from these problems by sprinkling a little supply-side fairy dust and thinking of Christmas. But the Republican Party is an organization of adults -- isn't it?

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
A philanthropist invests in downtown Portland, Me., hoping to help stem the flight to the suburbs.

BYLINE: By Susan Diesenhouse 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me.

 BODY:
THIS picturesque port city has been benefiting from investments by one of the state's top philanthropists, Elizabeth B. Noyce, who has turned her attention to commercial real estate.
Mrs. Noyce was once married to the late Robert Norman Noyce, co-inventor of the integrated circuit and the co-founder of the Intel Corporation, the largest maker of chips for personal computers. She has been a leading supporter of cultural and medical institutions and education in Maine. Last year she spent about $13 million to buy two blocks and part of a third in the downtown here. 
 With the purchases she got three office towers and an old five-and-dime store and some land, all off Congress Street, a principal commercial thoroughfare, between Brown and Elm Streets. Her goal is to entice back to the city commercial tenants that might otherwise rent space in suburban malls.
Mrs. Noyce said her real estate companies -- the October Corporation and the August Corporation -- spent $1 million in 1995 and would spend $1 million this year to refurbish the office buildings. In the fall, she hopes to build a year-round farmer's market of about 60,000 square feet and a 700-car garage.
"We intend to inspire people to come back downtown, not to develop it enormously but to reverse the trend out to the suburbs," Mrs. Noyce said in an interview. "I've been told by people that this is bringing a breath of fresh air to Portland."
Mrs. Noyce, 65, became a summer resident of Maine in 1968, when she and her husband bought a vacation home. After their divorce in the mid-70's, she became a permanent resident. Mr. Noyce died in 1990.
Mrs. Noyce joined the downtown business community in 1991, when the bank she used, the Bank of New England, failed, and she founded a new bank, the Maine Bank and Trust Company. When that bank needed expansion space, she bought the building that housed it, on Congress Street.
Now, the October Corporation is leasing offices that might otherwise be vacant by offering concessions like extensive improvements, rents that are modestly below market rates and perhaps a period of free or reduced rent.
"That will make it possible to fill up retail space and attract arts groups," according to Barbara Hagar, executive director of the Downtown Portland Association, which manages an improvement district for the neighborhood. "Betty Noyce has the patient money that the city needs."
Mrs. Noyce said that if her property investments were successful her response would be to "buy another portion of downtown."
Portland, a city of about six square miles, with 63,000 residents and 3.8 million square feet of office space, has been losing businesses and residents to its suburbs since the 1970's. By 1992, it was experiencing a debilitating mix of suburban flight, economic recession and a decline in the commercial real estate market. The downtown office vacancy rate climbed to 23 percent.
The turnaround has been rapid, with the vacancy rate last year down to 11.9 percent, said James D. Harnden, a partner of Ram Harnden Commercial Real Estate. The asking rent for prime office space is $14.50 to $18 a square foot and for secondary space, $8 to $13. Retail space on the popular Exchange Street is leasing for $15 to $19 a square foot compared with almost $25 in some malls, Mr. Harnden said.
Mrs. Noyce and some smaller new landlords "have brought in more activity downtown than we've seen in 10 years," he added.
Of the 350,000 square feet in its three office towers, all of which are on Congress Street, the October Corporation has leased about 50,000 square feet since it closed on the properties last summer.
The vacancy rate at 465 Congress Street has gone from 15 percent to 3 percent, and at 477 Congress from 15 percent to 5 percent. But at 511 Congress, the major tenant, Fleet Bank, recently left, causing the vacancy rate to jump from 46 percent to 70 percent, said Morris L. Fisher, a broker with the Boulos Company.
One new tenant at 465 Congress, a stately 10-story turn-of-the-century tower, is Ghislaine Berube, a partner in Hughes Berube, a small computer consulting company.
Last fall, her company moved from nearby Cape Elizabeth to Portland. It hired a new employee and is renting 1,500 square feet at $8 a square foot. The October Corporation built a wall to create a room, installed new carpeting and painted. Such refurbished accommodations could command $10 a square foot, Mr. Fisher said.
Ms. Berube chose the building because she likes the Victorian lobby replete with marble, brass and mahogany details; the central location; the nearby parking garage, and the relatively crime-free neighborhood.
"It's a warm and fuzzy town and a very attractive building," she said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Expectations Of Rate Cuts Lift Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
With the bond market still holding fast to its expectations of further interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, with a weak regional report on business conditions generating only a muted response.
Prices rose early as traders anticipated a flow of cash into short-term Treasuries from investors taking profits on the recent gains in the stock market. This forced traders short-selling the bonds -- that is, betting against the market -- to buy Treasuries instead, to either take profit or limit losses. At the same time rumors of a hedge fund buying three-year notes helped keep prices generally higher. 
 Traders said that bond-fund managers bought all maturities each time prices dipped, and they said they expected this type of choppy trading to continue in the near term.
For the most part, the market ignored the 94-cent surge in prices for oil contracts -- a measure of the bullishness of this bond market, traders said. Unlike gold, crude oil is watched closely by the market and is considered a good gauge of inflation. But yesterday, the traders said, the rise in oil prices appeared to be caused by the recent cold weather, and energy prices remained at relatively low levels over all.
The 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32, to a price of 99 16/22; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, slipped to 6.02 percent, from 6.03 percent on Monday.
The Atlanta Fed's index of regional business activity for the month of January was a -12.3, compared with a -23.5 in December, with most components in the index up from their levels a month ago, indicating that the Southeast economy was weak, but not more than anticipated.
Another bit of data released yesterday, this by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was the employment cost index for the fourth quarter of 1995. It indicated that labor costs remained restrained, another good sign of subdued inflation.
The index for private industry workers, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, a bit more than expected but only because of what appears to have been a year-end jump in benefits, Cheryl R. Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said.
William J. Michaelcheck, chairman of Mariner Investment Group, a money management firm, described yesterday's session as quiet, with bond prices showing little movement.
"The market, however, is still bullish," he said. "But it has stabilized, with yield levels not changing much. People have factored more Fed interest-rate cuts into current prices."
A two-year Treasury note yielding 4.80 percent, Mr. Michaelcheck said, would be consistent with a Federal funds rate -- a Fed rate controlling what banks can charge each other for overnght loans -- of 4 percent; it is now at 4.25 percent.
Thus, Mr. Michaelcheck said, the market is anticipating further easings over the course of the year. "And because there is not much disagreement in the market over that," he said, "there is little volatility." Yesterday the two-year issue closed higher to yield 4.78 percent.
Mr. Michaelcheck noted that the data that has been released so far this year implied a weak economy in 1996, with slow growth. The market will start to get economics statistics during the next month or so that will either validate or prove wrong what the market has priced in.
"Because the market is being bullish, it is vulnerable to strong economic news and could sell off sharply if it found that the economy is rebounding," he said.
In bond futures trading, which influences trading in the cash market -- especially on days when there's little fundamental data available -- prices moved in a narrow range. Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst for Thomson Research of Boston, said she believed that the futures market was at a crossroad.
"While there are a lot of conflicting technical indicators, what is exerting the most control over the market is the monthly uptrend and its will to push prices higher," she said.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises, but Broad Stock Measures Fall

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Broad measures of stocks fell yesterday, led by a slump in semiconductor companies, but the Dow Jones industrial average managed a small gain, for its seventh consecutive record.
The Dow had been down 40 points late in the day but rebounded in the final minutes of trading to end with a rise of 1.08 points, to 5,601.23. In the last seven days, the 30-stock average has added 227.33 points, or 4.2 percent. 
 But broader indicators fell off their records, reacting to news that an industry gauge of demand for semiconductors fell in January to its lowest level in five years, suggesting profit drops for chip makers.
Also, "people are nervous because the stock market is up 10 percent in the past month or so," said Phil Schettewi, a money manager at Loomis Sayles in Washington.
Declining stocks outnumbered advancers yesterday by 1,226 to 1,090 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 441.5 million shares changed hands, compared with 401.5 million shares on Monday.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 0.94 point, to 660.51, after rising as much as 2.78 points. Declines in regional telephone, computer and semiconductor issues outweighed gains in oil, insurance and bank shares.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.16 points, to 1,087.22, ending a three-day streak of records. Intel and Applied Materials, both microchip makers, fell the most. Other broad indexes also turned lower.
After the close of trading on Monday, the Semiconductor Industry Association said the book-to-bill ratio declined to 0.93 in January from a revised 1.12 in December. That means chip makers received only $93 in new orders for each $100 of products shipped last month. Concern that slowing demand will hurt profits pushed Intel shares down 1 7/64, to 57 1/8, Applied Materials fell 1 5/8, to 38 3/8.
Micron Technology fell as much as 1 1/4 after it was downgraded by Duff & Phelps Investment Research and Pacific Crest Securities, then rebounded to finish at 37 3/4, up 3/4.
Still, losses in semiconductor shares were limited because investors were braced for bad news. Concern began spreading last year that lower chip prices and expanding production would stunt profits, prompting money managers like Jeffrey Vinik of Fidelity's Magellan Fund to cut their positions.
Gains in chip stocks helped fuel 1995's rally, pushing the Philadelphia semiconductor index up more than 100 percent during the first eight months of last year. Since Sept. 8, the index has fallen 36.5 percent.
Many analysts said the weak orders report signaled that makers of personal computers and chips ordered too many semiconductors late last year, and then had excess inventory at the end of the fourth quarter.
"In the fourth quarter, there were some overly optimistic expectations of demand for memory," said Ron Bohn, chip analyst at Dataquest Inc. "We are seeing some of the ripple effects of over-ordering showing up as cancellations now."
Some money managers expect that orders will pick up and profits will balloon later this year. "In my heart of hearts I think that 1996 will be the beginning of a massive corporate upgrade cycle" in computers "that will spur a huge rally in tech stocks as we go through this year," said Philip J. Orlando, money manager at Value Line Asset Management, which oversees $5.5 billion of investment money.
Computer companies also fell yesterday. Morgan Stanley downgraded Compaq Computer and Dell Computer to "neutral" from "outperform." Dell dropped 2 11/16, to 31 1/4, and Compaq skidded 1 1/4, to 50. I.B.M. lost 1 5/8, to 113 5/8.
Office Depot said fourth-quarter earnings rose 11 percent, less than analysts had expected. The stock fell 1, to 19 1/4.
Banks, which benefit first from lower interest rates, gained. Citicorp rose 1/2, to 76; BankAmerica climbed 3/8, to 70 3/4, and Banc One advanced 5/8, to 39 1/2.
Shares of regional telephone companies slipped after surging on Monday. Merrill Lynch lowered its long-term opinion on BellSouth and U S West to "above average" from "buy." BellSouth slid 1, to 44 1/2, after adding 1 5/8 on Monday; U S West fell 1 1/4, to 35 3/4. Ameritech slumped 1 1/2, to 64 7/8, and Bell Atlantic skidded 7/8, to 73 1/2.
Teledyne rose 1, to 28, after WHX sweetened its takeover offer to $1.67 billion, or $30 a share. The maker of aviation electronics, among other things, has spurned two offers from WHX since November 1994.
United Technologies jumped 2 7/8, to 105 3/4. The maker of Carrier air- conditioners and Otis elevators said it would use its free cash to acquire companies and buy back shares.

HEADLINE: Index of Pay and Benefits Rose 2.9% in '95

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
For the sixth consecutive year, the raises that American workers receive have been smaller, or no higher, than those of the year before, according to 1995 figures released today by the Labor Department.
The 2.9 percent increase in overall compensation last year, the skimpiest since at least 1980, was just enough to keep workers ahead of inflation, which at the consumer level ran at a 2.5 percent pace. 
 "The good news is no inflation," Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, said in an interview, alluding to the fact that payrolls account for about 70 percent of business costs. "The bad news is no raise."
Reiterating a Clinton Administration theme -- the widening income gap between ordinary workers and the well educated -- Mr. Reich noted that in private industry those in blue-collar occupations had increases in pay and benefits averaging 2.5 percent last year compared with a 3.1 percent gain for white-collar jobs.
"White-collar workers beat inflation," the Secretary said. "Blue-collar workers didn't."
A surge in costs did appear in the figures for the final three months of the year, however, with the Employment Cost Index rising nine-tenths of 1 percent. That is the biggest increase in nearly three years and markedly more than had been expected. The jump was attributed to a surge in the cost of benefits even as wages and salaries maintained the steady pace they have kept for some time.
Analysts acknowledged surprise at the jump in benefits costs, which the department attributed to "a reversal in the trend of declining increases" in the cost of health insurance and bonus payments. But most of the analysts said this did not portend faster inflation.
"Labor-cost increases are still quite small, though there's a suggestion that perhaps the very best of the labor market performance is behind us for this cycle," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities in New York.
He added that he did not think these figures, which are closely followed by the Federal Reserve, would prevent the Fed from making further cuts in short-term interest rates to keep a slackening economic expansion going as it approaches its fifth anniversary. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is to tell Congress next week what strategy the Fed agreed upon at its policy session at the end of January.
"We do not expect to see any intensification of wage pressures this year," Merrill Lynch told its clients today. "We believe that inflation will remain dormant during 1996. And we expect the Fed to continue to ease policy."
Some analysts, however, were at least mildly concerned about the final quarter's surge in benefit costs, even though Mr. Reich dismissed the increase as "almost entirely" bonuses and Joseph E. Stiglitz, the President's top economic adviser, said, "I don't see anything disquieting."
One analyst expressing concern was David C. Munro of High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Westchester County, N.Y. He said he regarded the increase as the latest in a series of indicators of budding wage pressures, including higher hourly earnings and anecdotal reports from the Federal Reserve and other sources about spot labor shortages.
Mr. Munro said bonuses should not be disregarded as aberrations or the exclusive province of Wall Street or the executive suite since they "are increasingly wage-like," with many more companies using them for flexibility now that increases in pay have been significantly "deautomated."
The 1.3 percent jump in fourth-quarter benefit costs, sharply higher than the four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the September quarter, lifted the 1995 total to 2.8 percent, the report showed. This was down from 3.4 percent in 1994 and was far from the 1988 peak of 7 percent.
Wages and salaries, which rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, the same as in the second and third quarters, advanced 2.9 percent for 1995, or about the same pace as has prevailed since a sharp deceleration in 1992.
Combining the components, total compensation costs were 2.9 percent higher for the year, slightly below the 3 percent rise in 1994 but the slimmest since records were started on a comparable basis in 1980. Merrill Lynch said this might be the smallest rise in labor compensation since the 1950's.
Higher compensation was more pronounced in service industries than in goods-producing industries, 3 percent versus 2.5 percent -- a reversal of 1994, when workers producing goods fared modestly better. Increases ranged from 2 percent at stores selling general merchandise to 5.4 percent for colleges and universities.
Among blue-collar workers, compensation gains ranged from 2.3 percent for machine operators, assemblers and inspectors to 3.3 percent for handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers and laborers.
Compensation of union members rose 3 percent, a bit higher than the 2.8 percent for nonunion workers; in service industries, union workers had a gain of 3.7 percent, compared with 2.9 percent for nonunion workers, but in goods-producing industries the rise for union workers, at 2.2 percent, trailed the 2.6 percent increase registered for nonunion employees.

HEADLINE: Report Warns That New York Area Could Decline

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The New York metropolitan region -- the nation's pre-eminent urban center, and a worldwide symbol of opportunity -- faces the threat of a long-term economic decline in the 21st century unless residents and politicians summon the will and resources to begin a multibillion-dollar campaign of transportation improvements, education reforms and urban rejuvenation, a major planning group said yesterday.
The report, based on a five-year study by the Regional Plan Association, a private research group based in Manhattan, looks ahead 24 years to the year 2020 and predicts two very different possible futures for the 31-county, three-state metropolitan area stretching from Litchfield, Conn., to central New Jersey. 
 One view features a bleak landscape of crumbling urban cores, increasingly isolated wealthy enclaves, transportation paralysis, deteriorating air and water quality and feeble economic growth. In the alternative vision, residents zip about in high-speed trains on a fully interconnected regional rail system patterned after the Paris Metro, the aging urban centers have been recaptured as places to live, work and play, and lifelong adult education and job banks connect the population to new opportunities in the global economy.
The report said that the first portrait would emerge as the region's future if current trends remained unchanged, and that making the second one a reality would require sacrifice, ingenuity and a rethinking of some of the region's most treasured tenets, from self-government in every small community to the historically arrogant self-identity that holds that the world will always beat a path to New York's door.
"It may be the last opportunity we have," the association's president, H. Claude Shostal, said at a news conference in lower Manhattan. "If we don't do it, we're going to be left behind."
As a small private organization, the Regional Plan Association has no power beyond the persuasiveness of its vision. But it has a history of imprinting that vision on the region, and it has connections. Its board of directors -- a list that ranges from academics like David C. Chang, president of Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, to Robert R. Kiley, former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- move in the upper circles of the region's business and politics.
While the authors of the report acknowledge that the governors of the three states have won office with an emphasis on cutting taxes, they say that such views are too much aimed at the next election or next budget and not at the long-term risk.
The association, the oldest urban planning group in the nation, has gazed ahead twice in this century, in 1929 and in 1968. Both of those studies concluded that harnessing uncontrolled growth was the New York region's gravest threat.
The new report starts from a fundamentally different place: the risk now, it states, is outright decline. That thought, even if only subconsciously adopted in the political and business communities, could reframe the debate about where the region is headed and how it will get there. The myth of New York as a tireless colossus, building and rebuilding itself through some untended machine of growth, is over, the plan's authors say.
"The issue is no longer how to manage growth, but how to find growth to manage," said the association's chairman, Gary C. Wendt, who is also the president and chief executive of the G.E. Capital Corporation in Stamford, Conn. "Our success is no longer guaranteed."
Another fundamentally changed assumption in the study concerns the suburbs. For the last 30 years, they were the engines of economic growth and job creation, as corporate office parks grew in the region's outer ring. But the deep recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, and the weak recovery since then, have rendered those old distinctions moot. Every part of the region suffered just about equally; there was no immunity of place.
"It shattered the myth of suburban economies' being independent and isolated," Mr. Shostal said. "You can't hide now."
The globalization of the world economy, the deep recession from 1989 to 1992, and region's weak recovery since then provide the backdrop and context of the study. The report concludes, for example, that the lavish commitment by governments in competing world business capitals like Singapore and Paris are making the flaws of New York region's infrastructure all the more glaring.
Competition within the United States is becoming just as intense. In the decade from 1982 to 1992, for example, the report said that employment in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut region grew by the smallest percentage of any of the nation's 15 major metropolitan areas.
But the constant theme of the report is also that the region has immense strengths and half-fulfilled promises that if capitalized upon, would create strong competitive advantages. The system of commuter railroads and the New York City subway, for example, were built totally without coordination and planning by private developers in the 1800's and early 1900's. But the report says that only 25 new miles of track, much of it laid in bits and pieces around the region, would interconnect the various systems, allowing single-ticket travel of the sort that many major urban systems around the world have long since adopted.
Money is of course the great hurdle for the plan. The total capital costs, according to the report, would total $75 billion over 25 years. And while all three governors and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said generally supportive things today in videotaped comments played at the association's news conference, none embraced any new system of taxation to raise money.
Polling research by the association also concludes that residents would not trust government with all that new money anyway. Robert D. Yaro, the association's research director and chief planning officer, said that a majority of residents of the region, questioned in a poll last year, said they would be willing to support higher gasoline taxes, as long as the proceeds were dedicated to specific capital improvements. That led to the idea of a tristate infrastructure bank that would distribute the new revenue stream, insulated from political pressures.

Robert Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, will discuss the outlook for the New York area tomorrow night in a live interview for computer users at 8 P.M. on @times, The New York Times's service on America Online. Questions may be sent in advance by e-mail to YaroRPA@aol.com.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CAUCUS;
Dole Ends the Race in Iowa As a Scalded Front-Runner

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Feb. 13

 BODY:
In his third outing in the Iowa caucuses, after more than three decades of tilling the political soil here, Senator Bob Dole of neighboring Kansas took only slightly more than a quarter of the votes Monday night, running powerfully only among older and wealthier voters, those who made up their minds a long time ago and those looking for Washington experience.
It was a dangerously narrow constituency for one who hopes to rally a disparate party in November. 
 An entrance poll conducted by the television networks and The Associated Press showed that among other groups whose backing Mr. Dole had sought, his performance was unimpressive. Moderate voters, for example, gave almost as many votes to Lamar Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, as to Mr. Dole.
A third of those who took part in the caucuses said the Senator's age -- at 73, he would be the oldest man ever elected President if he won this fall -- would hurt him in the White House.
Mr. Dole returned to New Hampshire, whose primary takes place a week from today, as a highly vulnerable front-runner. His 26 percent of the total Iowa vote was well below the 37 percent he won here against a smaller field in 1988, and slightly below his own purposely modest target of 28 percent for this year.
The other candidates finished as follows: Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, 23 percent; Mr. Alexander, 18 percent; Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher, 10 percent; Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, 9 percent; Alan Keyes, an anti-abortion crusader, 7 percent; Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, 4 percent; Morry Taylor, a businessman, 1 percent, and Representative Robert K. Dornan of California, less than 1 percent.
In many ways, the outcome mirrored the one eight years ago, when the television evangelist Pat Robertson finished second to Mr. Dole with 25 percent and George Bush came in third with 19 percent. Mr. Alexander will now hope to do what Mr. Bush did in New Hampshire in 1988, when he vaulted from third place to first, overtaking Mr. Dole, and went on to win the Republican nomination and the Presidency.
Arguing that Mr. Buchanan was too divisive a candidate to be nominated, Mr. Alexander said with renewed vigor this morning that the race would come down to him and Mr. Dole, and that the Senator was "too old to be the first President of the next century." He repeated the mnemonic aid he has used for months: "A B C -- Alexander Beats Clinton."
The entrance poll suggested that Mr. Alexander had taken votes from Mr. Dole in the final stages of the Iowa campaign. About 40 percent of Mr. Alexander's backers said they had once considered supporting the Kansan. And 40 percent of his backers said they decided to vote for him in the final three days.
During that time, Mr. Alexander asserted that he had avoided negative campaigning, even though he ran an ad labeling Mr. Dole a Washington insider and Mr. Forbes a Wall Street insider, and accused his rivals of mudslinging.
Mr. Alexander, 55, who served as Secretary of Education in the Bush Administration, drew support from all segments of the party, although he did least well among those who called themselves strong conservatives. Of his backers, 34 percent said they were moderates, 46 percent described themselves as somewhat conservative and 12 percent said they considered themselves very conservative.
The lion's share of very conservative voters, who have risen to prominence in the Iowa Republican Party in recent years, went to Mr. Buchanan. He got 37 percent of their votes to 21 percent for Mr. Dole. Mr. Buchanan must now hope that he can emulate Ronald Reagan, who dramatically broadened his appeal in 1980 in moving from a second-place finish in Iowa to a victory in New Hampshire, rather than flaming out like Mr. Robertson eight years later, who never matched his Iowa showing.
Mr. Buchanan was full of fire, if hoarse of voice, in television appearances this morning, asserting that he alone could recapture for the Republicans this fall the voters who supported Ross Perot's third-party candidacy four years ago.
Mr. Buchanan argued that economic issues -- the loss of jobs to Mexico and Southeast Asia in particular -- are as important to his campaign as social issues. But the entrance poll showed that 62 percent of his Iowa supporters identified themselves as part of the religious right, and 74 percent of them said they backed a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion. Over all, caucus participants split on such an amendment, with 46 percent supporting it and 44 percent opposing it.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who backed Mr. Dole, said Mr. Buchanan was "sticking his head in the sand" in advocating American withdrawal from international trade agreements. Doing so would cripple Iowa's agricultural and industrial exporters, he said, "but people didn't focus on his economic message."
Some have suggested that Mr. Buchanan, who once wrote speeches for Richard M. Nixon, will find the going tougher in New Hampshire, where social issues are generally less salient than economic issues, especially taxes. In rebuttal, he pointed to his race against Mr. Bush in New Hampshire: "I almost beat the President of the United States in 1992 in eight weeks, without a nickel in my jeans."
But the state was in the throes of a recession, from which it has since emerged. Even then, Mr. Buchanan was unable to build on his New Hampshire showing in later tests.
Because he has almost unlimited resources and because his flat-tax plan has played well in New Hampshire, few were willing to write off Mr. Forbes just yet, but the survey suggested that his campaign themes failed to take hold in Iowa, despite a relentless, unprecedented $4 million television blitz.
About half the caucus participants, for example, said they preferred a flat tax to the present graduated income tax. But of those who backed a flat tax, Mr. Forbes won only 18 percent, about as many as Mr. Dole, even though Mr. Forbes built his campaign around the idea. Mr. Buchanan, who produced his own version of a flat tax relatively late in the game, got the support of 25 percent of the group.
Another favorite Forbes theme also appeared to have availed him little. He assiduously proclaimed his credentials as an outsider who would root out what he termed "the Washington culture" of bureaucracy and corruption, but when asked what decided their vote, only 7 percent of the caucus-goers said they sought someone who was not a career politician.
What did matter in Iowa, the entrance poll indicated, were conservative values, followed by an ability to beat President Clinton and experience in Washington, which was mentioned by 15 percent. So it could be said that twice as many people here rejected Mr. Forbes's anti-insider crusade as accepted it.
If Mr. Dole's support was concentrated among those more than 45 years of age and those with family incomes exceeding $75,000, it was geographically dispersed. Where he was best organized, he ran most strongly, whether in rural southeastern Iowa, industrial Waterloo in the north or Johnson County, which includes Iowa City and the University of Iowa.
Alone among the candidates, Mr. Dole is well organized in all of the important states that have yet to vote. But organization has proved less important, historically speaking, in primary contests than in the caucuses here.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE NEXT STEP;
DOLE OPENS DRIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH NEW THEME

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole opened the seven-day sprint to the nation's first Republican primary here today by reaching for a new economic message tailored to the populism of Patrick J. Buchanan, who finished a close second to the Senator in the Iowa caucuses.
Appropriating a theme that worked for Mr. Buchanan in Iowa on Monday and in his challenge to President George Bush here four years ago, Mr. Dole attacked corporate greed and appealed for the support of blue-collar workers. It was a departure both for Mr. Dole and for the Republican Party, which historically caters more to well-heeled voters. 
 "Corporate profits are setting records and so are corporate layoffs," said Mr. Dole, looking tired and subdued as he stood before the State Legislature in Concord. "The bond market finished a spectacular year. But the real average hourly wage is 5 percent lower than it was a decade ago. Two years ago, family earnings were hit with the largest tax increase in the history of America."
As the candidates converged on New Hampshire, there was already a first casualty in the wake of the outcome of the Iowa caucuses. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas plans to announce on Wednesday that he will withdraw from the race, aides said.
Mr. Gramm had come on forcefully in last year's run-up to primary season, raising millions of dollars and building organizations in several states. But he was unable to translate those efforts into votes. He placed a dismal fifth in Iowa and was upset by Mr. Buchanan the week before in the Louisiana caucuses. [Article, page B9.]
By contrast, Mr. Buchanan today was savoring his rise to the top of the competition, while pressing forward with his economic themes. In Manchester, he told a crowd of about 250 reporters: "New Hampshire, like every other part of America, feels that sense of economic insecurity, economic stress. They are suffering, too, from wages that seem to go down as the Dow Jones hits 5600."
Until today, Mr. Dole's economic message was largely devoted to the need for a balanced Federal budget. But the unexpected strength of Mr. Buchanan in Iowa, and Mr. Dole's own less-than-decisive performance, seemed to spur the Senator to revise his appeal.
While the economic picture here has improved dramatically in this state in the last four years -- the unemployment rate was 3.2 percent in December, well below the national average of 5.6 percent -- Mr. Dole is clearly banking on the issue of the economy. When he took on Mr. Bush in 1992, Mr. Buchanan did best among voters to whom economic problems were of particular concern.
Mr. Buchanan, fighting a head cold and looking exhausted, accused Mr. Dole of taking his issues, and dismissed criticism from his opponents that he is too extreme to capture the nomination.
"How can my views be too extreme when Bob Dole is echoing me on every issue?" Mr. Buchanan asked at a midday news conference here. "We are now moving the national debate in the direction in which we have been trying to take America; the Republican Party is becoming a Buchanan party."
As the campaign shifted from the flatlands of Iowa to the rockier terrain of this state, the contenders adjusted not only their message on issues but to the altered state of the race.
The one candidate who was all smiles today was former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who finished third in Iowa. After plodding anonymously along the campaign trail for more than a year, today was a day to bask in a newfound glare.
"Now that we've had this contest in Iowa, we know that the race will come down to Senator Dole and me," Mr. Alexander told a group of schoolchildren who greeted him in a hotel room here at 6:30 A.M., only four hours after he landed in New Hampshire.
At every stop, Mr. Alexander asserted that Iowans had responded to his upbeat message amid the blizzard of negative advertising in the state, particularly from the campaign of Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate who came in fourth. Even so, Mr. Alexander was broadcasting a commercial in New Hampshire that attacked Mr. Dole as "a Washington insider for 35 years" and Mr. Forbes as "a Wall Street insider his entire life."
Mr. Forbes did not travel to New Hampshire today, and instead returned home to New Jersey, where he spent the day in strategy meetings. Aides said he was also filming a new batch of commercials -- this time, positive ones.
The top three finishers in Iowa devoted much of the day jockeying for position. The Dole campaign sought to place itself as being in a one-on-one race with Mr. Buchanan. That is probably because Mr. Dole is battling Mr. Alexander for many of the same voters who are more moderate than Mr. Buchanan's backers. In addition, advisers to Mr. Dole said they believed he had far more appeal than Mr. Buchanan, who, polls show, has particularly high negative ratings.
Barely mentioning his narrow victory in Iowa, Mr. Dole raised the stakes for himself in this state. "Whoever wins next Tuesday in New Hampshire will probably be the Republican nominee," he said in remarks to a small gathering at a fire house in Goffstown.
The messages of the candidates who arrived in New Hampshire today seemed to reflect that voters in this state's Republican primary are generally more moderate than caucus-goers in Iowa, perhaps because independents here can vote in either party's primary. Four years ago, 35 percent of the Republican primary voters described their affiliation as independent, in a survey of voters leaving the polls.
Three-quarters of the voters in the Iowa caucuses described themselves as conservative, while four years ago in New Hampshire, polling showed that only 55 percent of primary voters considered themselves conservatives and 35 percent moderates.
On Monday, 35 percent of the caucus-goers in Iowa said they considered themselves part of the conservative Christian political movement, and Mr. Buchanan drew the largest share of those voters. But polls showed that only 9 percent of the Republican primary voters in New Hampshire in 1988 considered themselves fundamentalists or evangelical Christians.
That might explain why today, Mr. Buchanan repeatedly emphasized his economic message.
Behind their orchestrated events, campaigns were assessing how much money they had to compete here this week, and how much they would need to continue after New Hampshire.
Mr. Alexander spent much of the day on the telephone soliciting contributions, including a conference call with 250 supporters, each of whom pledged to raise $5,000 by the end of the week. His aides said they needed a quick infusion for the campaign to move South.
Mr. Buchanan, who is also scraping for money, said there was a surge in calls to his toll-free campaign number Monday night, from an average of 50-75 a day up to 1,200. "They do wonder whether we can win," he said of the callers. "But more and more are coming to believe that Pat Buchanan can be the next President of the United States."
Beyond the candidates, voters here were gearing for a final weeklong frenzy of campaigning. "Iowa said something like who ain't going to be President," said Eddie Barker, 66, a school bus driver in Concord. "Next week, we're going to tell you who is."

HEADLINE: White House Rebukes G.O.P. For Scuttling Nominee to Fed

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The White House, giving up on the nomination of Felix G. Rohatyn to be the Federal Reserve's vice chairman, attacked Congressional Republicans yesterday for blocking the appointment of an "obviously qualified" candidate, and poisoning the atmosphere in Washington.
Michael D. McCurry, President Clinton's press secretary, said the Republicans had engaged in cheap election-year politics, while Laura D'Andrea Tyson, director of the White House National Economic Council, took the criticism a step further, accusing the Republicans of opposing potential appointees simply because they failed to share conservative views. 
 "These are people with high credentials," Ms. Tyson said, referring to Mr. Rohatyn and also to Alicia H. Munnell, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, whom the White House decided not to nominate for a Fed seat after Republicans mounted a campaign against her.
"You don't have to agree with everything Ms. Munnell and Mr. Rohatyn said at every point in their lives," Ms. Tyson said, "but there is no question they have the capability and capacity to serve the country on the Federal Reserve."
A similar theme -- an increasingly partisan system that no longer thrives on the give-and-take of forthright debate -- was struck by Mr. Rohatyn, the 67-year-old New York investment banker, in an interview yesterday.
Having asked President Clinton on Monday to no longer consider him as a potential nominee, Mr. Rohatyn offered an angry view of the evolution of national politics.
During the 1960's and 70's, Mr. Rohatyn noted, he had headed commissions in New York that helped nurse the New York Stock Exchange through a crisis and saved the city from bankruptcy. In each case, he said, he had worked with people of strongly divergent political views and ideology, all pulling successfully toward common goals. But such cooperation, he said, was no longer welcomed in Washington.
"What troubles me most is not the fact that I am not going to be vice chairman," he said. "What is important is the inability to reach across ideological differences in order to have a rational dialogue about hugely important economic issues."
Republican lawmakers defended their actions, arguing that Mr. Rohatyn's views were too far outside what they considered the economic mainstream. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, chairman of the Banking Committee, said "the vast majority" of his committee's members simply did not support the Rohatyn nomination.
Mr. Rohatyn, a managing director of Lazard Freres & Company, had sought the Fed nomination. He enlisted people in Washington to help him in his quest, among them Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Republican Senate leader and chief of staff for President Ronald Reagan.
But with Senator Connie Mack of Florida acting as spokesman, Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee -- which must approve nominations to the Fed's seven-member board of governors -- made clear to the Administration their adamant objections to Mr. Rohatyn.
"At this point," Mr. Rohatyn remarked yesterday, "I would say to you that the charm of public office is considerably diminished in my mind, and the charm of the private sector considerably enhanced."
Until the early 1980's, the Fed vice chairmanship often went to men more closely linked to the central bank's chairman than to the Administration. That changed with President Reagan's appointment of Preston Martin as Paul A. Volcker's vice chairman, ushering in an era in which the vice chairman emerged as the Administration's point man at the Fed. Mr. Martin and his successors occasionally clashed with Mr. Volcker and with Mr. Greenspan, his successor.
Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton University economist who left the vice chairmanship when his term expired two weeks ago, was in this tradition, and Mr. Rohatyn had promised to be a similar Administration voice.
Now the White House is in a quandary. Mr. Greenspan's second four-year term expires on March 2, and Mr. Clinton is widely expected to renominate him. But the President had hoped to package the Greenspan nomination with a vice chairmanship of his choice.
With Mr. Rohatyn's candidacy dead, however, Mr. Clinton could be forced to either leave the vice chairmanship vacant for the time being or to nominate someone more acceptable to the Republicans -- and perhaps more in sync with Mr. Greenspan's views.
The President met yesterday afternoon with his top economic advisers and asked them to come up with a new list of names, both for the vice chairmanship and for another Fed governor's post that is vacant, Administration officials said.
The issue that sank Mr. Rohatyn, more than any other, was economic growth. He has described himself as conservative -- "very conservative," he said yesterday -- but nevertheless an advocate for greater economic growth than Mr. Greenspan might favor. Without a more robust economy, he said, "balancing the budget is a fantasy and avoiding serious social strains is a fantasy."
That view drew sharp criticism from Senator Mack, who is also chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. In memos prepared by Joint Economic Committee staff members, Mr. Rohatyn was portrayed as insufficiently concerned about inflation and as likely to bring "unsophisticated" economic views to Fed policy-making.
"There was a feeling among the Republicans, led by Senator Mack, whom I have never met, that my views represent a danger to the Fed and to the integrity of the nation," Mr. Rohatyn said, adding, "I am open to discussion on a lot of issues, and I have great difficulty living in a world of absolutes -- which is where we seem to be heading."

Poor Showings In 2 Contests Lead Gramm To Withdraw

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Reeling from back-to-back defeats in Louisiana and Iowa, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas decided today to quit the race for the Republican Presidential nomination, ending an extravagantly planned and financed campaign and making him the first casualty of the primary season.
Mr. Gramm was on the verge of throwing his support behind Senator Bob Dole, people close to both men said tonight. The Kansas Senator was to speak with Mr. Gramm by phone Wednesday morning. 
 Mr. Gramm's decision, which he is to announce at a news conference on Wednesday, came after he placed fifth in Monday's Iowa caucuses, and second to Patrick J. Buchanan in the Louisiana caucuses, which had led most political experts to believe that his candidacy had failed.
Mr. Gramm canceled a series of campaign events today. He declined to say directly what he had in mind, but left little doubt that he considered his campaign's prospects bleak.
"When you run fifth in Iowa, an important state, you would have to be brain-dead not to take a look at where you are and what you're doing," Mr. Gramm told reporters in Iowa today before leaving for this state. "One of the things that we're going to try to do this afternoon and tonight is take a look at where we are."
A senior Gramm aide said tonight that Mr. Gramm's chances had essentially collapsed in the week after he was upset in the Feb. 6 Louisiana caucuses by Mr. Buchanan. That was a state that Mr. Gramm had boasted he would win right up until the night of the caucusing, thus elevating what otherwise might have been a passing political event into a well-covered embarrassment.
Gramm aides said that until the caucuses in Louisiana, their polling had shown the Senator in "a very strong position for second," in Iowa, a state where he had always wanted to do well. "We felt very confident," an aide said. "Then Louisiana took the wind right out of our sails."
Although there was some sentiment in the Gramm campaign to hang on through next Tuesday's primary here, in the hope that Mr. Dole's campaign might stumble and give Mr. Gramm one last opening, in the end the Texas Senator's advisers concluded that was untenable.
"You can't finish second in Louisiana, fifth in Iowa and even third in New Hampshire and hope to keep raising money," the aide said.
Mr. Gramm's withdrawal came almost a year to the day after he formally announced his candidacy at Texas A & M University, where he was an economics professor for 12 years.
His departure is particularly striking because, on paper at least, he had seemed to have everything in place from the day he announced his candidacy.
He was a Senator, with flush campaign treasury -- he raised $21.1 million last year -- and a crafted conservative economic and social message which seemed perfectly attuned for voters who dominate the Republican primary process.
But there were flaws to the strategy, not the least of which was that Mr. Gramm was a candidate who was not helped by exposure. He had a plodding style that his own aides discovered during their campaign research was more likely to irritate than to ignite voters.
Mr. Gramm seemed to become increasingly concerned about this as his standing in the polls stagnated and other candidates vaulted past him. Mr. Gramm asked reporters whether they found him arrogant.
On a political level, Mr. Gramm's attempt to present himself as the candidate best able to unite social and economic conservatives was put to the test in Iowa, and it failed.
Mr. Buchanan fanned persistent doubts among Christian conservatives about Mr. Gramm's commitment to outlawing abortion. The strong second-place showing by Mr. Buchanan left Mr. Gramm with little hope of claiming the conservative mantle.
Finally, Mr. Gramm seems to have been betrayed by his own political calculus as well. He employed a novel approach to winning the nomination, attempting to win early notice by tending the fields outside of New Hampshire and Iowa. He invested efforts in states that had not before played a prominent role in the selection process, including Louisiana, Arizona and Delaware.
But he lost Louisiana. And he irritated political leaders in both New Hampshire and Iowa, who are protective of their early places in the political selection system.
Mr. Gramm's expected withdrawal would leave the race to four main contenders: Mr. Dole, Mr. Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, who finished third in Iowa, and Steve Forbes, who finished fourth.

Richter Awaits Start Of His Second Season

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: RYE, N.Y., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Mike Richter stopped several hundred pucks in practice today at Playland Ice Casino. Then he walked into the Ranger locker room and stumbled awkwardly over the big leg pads of Glenn Healy, who has started the last 16 games in goal.
A few minutes later, Coach Colin Campbell purposefully walked up to Richter's locker and, with theatrical solemnity, asked Richter if he was ready to play Thursday night against the Montreal Canadiens at Madison Square Garden. 
 "I can play tonight," said Richter.
Much of this was for show. The pratfall over the pads is a running gag between the two goalies, who share a limited amount of space in the same corner of the room. The questioning by the coach was staged for the benefit of reporters who had been peppering Richter with the same sort of questions.
Richter, who has been sidelined for seven weeks with a serious groin injury, is expected to dress Thursday night when the Rangers try to equal the franchise record of 24 consecutive games without defeat at home. It isn't certain, however, if he will be the starter.
"I feel good, I feel really good," Richter said. "I'm getting my timing back and I'm getting strong. I can come back whenever called upon. I thought I would play last weekend, but we held off, and I think that was a good idea.
"With an injury like this, you have to be absolutely certain it's not going to be damaged. A'd, even under those circumstances, it could still happen."
Richter said the groin muscle "actually pulled right off the bone where it connects" when he made a save in a victory at Edmonton.
"It's high up, every movement originates from there, it seems, it's such a central area," Richter said. "It's about as debilitating as you get for a goaltender."
Campbell said he wouldn't make a decision on his starter until Wednesday. "We don't have to push it, so why should we?" he said. "Wait until it's 100 percent. You always have to play through scar tissue and push it that last mile. With any player, you can't really push it until you get into the game. He doesn't have to play unless he goes in as a backup in the first one, two, three, four games."
During today's spirited practice, which Campbell called "a goal-tender's practice," Richter faced drills during which columns of teammates tested him with wrist shots, backhanders and slap shots. When Richter quickly slid across to make a save on Luc Robitaille's rebound, the captain Mark Messier led the cheers by banging his stick on the boards and smiling.
When Richter skated the puck out toward the blue line, seeking to pass it, a few teammates yelled "Go! Go!" and "Shoot! Shoot!" But he declined to take any unnecessary chances.
Before the injury, Richter had a record of 19-8-3 with a goals-against average of 2.62. Following Sunday's 6-2 victory in Tampa Bay, Healy is 14-5-7 and 2.79.
"The biggest key for me is patience," Richter said. "When you see the light at the end of the tunnel, you start kind of sprinting for it a little bit."
During the first two weeks of the rehabilitation, he spent two hours a day in the hyperbaric chamber, which is phought to speed the healing process. He managed to finish a book called "Jihad vs. McWorld," (Times Books, 1995).
"It's about the globalization of world economics," said Richter.
Last summer, Richter studied existentialist authors at Columbia, calling it a "nice change of gears" and "incredibly interesting" after a disappointing season.
Kierkegaard, Camus and Sartre. Sounds like one of the forward lines from the old Quebec Nordiques.

HEADLINE: Association Benefited From Links To Politics

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Since 1929, when it issued its first master plan for the 31 counties in and around New York City, the Regional Plan Association has provided long-range blueprints for the region. Though it had no money to carry out those plans, it did hold the attention of governors, mayors, developers and corporate planners who could carry out its vision.
The association, which now has a staff of 25 and an annual budget of $2.5 million provided by dozens of companies and foundations, was formed in 1923 by 12 prominent New York City business executives to focus on the region's future. Fortuitously, that group included Frederic Delano, the uncle of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
 Historians say its first plan, released in 1929, months before the stock market crash, succeeded in providing a map that guided road, bridge, tunnel and airport construction and parkland acquisition for the next four decades. Predicting an era of sweeping economic expansion, the plan called for commuter parkways, interstate expressways and new rail services to connect New York City to its rapidly growing suburbs.
Although the experts now point to flaws in the 1929 plan -- saying it overemphasized road construction and its recommendation for large-scale railroad construction was never adopted -- its successes are attributed to the political allegiences it inspired.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for instance, had ties to the plan from its inception through his uncle and as the former Governor of New York. When he formed the the National Planning Board in 1936 under another New Yorker, Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes, the New York region received a disproportionate amount of Federal aid through the Public Works Administration.
In a 30-year building spree, Robert Moses, the legendary master builder, marshalled city, state and Federal money into construction of the Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester County, the Northern State and Southern State parkways on Long Island, and the creation of Bear Mountain State Park and Jones Beach State Park.
And Austin Tobin, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, presided over construction of large parts of the George Washington Bridge, the Lincoln Tunnel and Newark Airport. Both men relied heavily on the 1929 Regional Plan to justify their developments and acquistions.
In 1968, when the Regional Plan Association issued its second master plan, it proclaimed a historic turn for the region. No longer was there a need for such sweeping growth; it emphasized the limiting of suburban sprawl and excessive reliance on cars.
Among the reccommendations in 1968 were that development and jobs be concentrated in New York City and several suburban hubs that were already served by rail lines or major highways -- Newark, White Plains, Stamford and others.
Although the second master plan failed to prompt any new government controls on development, it captured the attention of many of the region's corporate planners. Persuaded by the plan, and using it to help local win zoning changes, companies like the G.T.E. Corporation and Champion International moved their headquarters from Manhattan to Stamford in early 1970's, and Johnson & Johnson built its headquarters in downtown New Brunswick, N.J.
These days, the association still has ties to political leaders: Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's mother was a member of its board 1977 to 1989.

HEADLINE: Dancing to Buchanan's Tune

 BODY:
As the endless caravans of Republican Presidential candidates spread out through New Hampshire this week, it is hard to reconcile this party with the finely tuned election machine that took over Congress a little over a year ago. Bob Dole has made being front-runner look like a dance competition as he tries to pick up the beat from Pat Buchanan. Lamar Alexander rides a new momentum, courtesy of the 17,000 Iowa Republicans who gave him a third-place showing in Monday night's caucuses. Steve Forbes lost, at least temporarily, his status as the leading Anybody But Dole. Having spent more than $400 per voter to come in fourth, Mr. Forbes will not qualify for any awards as investor of the week.
The true message of Iowa may be that the Republicans preferred watching the "Chicago Hope" lobotomy episode to supporting any of the options offered up on their plate. Fewer than 100,000 voters -- down from 120,000 in 1988 -- turned out to decide who would get a lift and who, like Phil Gramm, would vanish into the shadows. A bigger crowd showed up for the "Pocahontas" premiere in Central Park. 
 Every election, however, has its story. Iowa's is that Pat Buchanan now owns the social conservative wing of the Republican Party, while the moderates are casting about desperately, flinging their allegiance from one Dole substitute to another. Among the candidates still standing as the New Hampshire primary approaches, Pat Buchanan is the only red-meat orator. That can be important to the Republicans, who are slowly evolving into the party of preference for male voters. A certain reek of testosterone on the stump is a valuable com modity, especially when coupled with Mr. Buchanan's swaggering presence.
He is still the darling of the religious right, but this season Mr. Buchanan's primary message is a sort of economic nationalism. He rails at immigration, the United Nations and Wall Street big shots who give American jobs to 70-cent-an-hour workers in Singapore. His solutions are high tariffs, protected industry and closing the border. The pitch worked so well in Iowa that yesterday in New Hampshire Mr. Dole discovered that he too was worried about corporate greed, blue-collar layoffs and U.N. threats to American sovereignty. Give the majority leader another few days of bad polls and he will be disowning Nafta and denouncing high quarterly earnings as a threat to the traditional values he learned as a boy in Kansas.
Mr. Buchanan's mix of xenophobic populism and social conservatism seems threatening to the coalition of well-off suburbanites and blue-collar workers that has been the Republicans' key to victory in recent years. Ronald Reagan pioneered the approach, tailoring his economic program to the business community while he won the hearts of the working class with issues like abortion, school prayer and affirmative action.
But poke Mr. Buchanan and you find yet another Republican supply-sider who thinks that what this country needs is a lower inheritance tax. When he is not raising up tariff walls, the Beltway's answer to Huey Long is conjuring up his own flat tax, capital gains break and dividend tax repeal.
The New Hampshire voters, who have a cornucopia of tax-cut plans to choose from next week, may wind up as confused as the voters in Iowa, where only 18 percent of those who favored a flat tax wound up voting for Steve Forbes. That is the most intriguing statistic of the campaign to date. Did the television ads not work, or was it the old Forbes charisma that kept them away in droves?

Deficit Looks Tiny as Issue

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
For nearly two years, the Republican economic rallying cry has been loud, insistent and single-minded: The biggest problem ailing the American economy is the Federal budget deficit, and the country cannot prosper until it is wiped out. But a Presidential campaign season has a way of rewriting political agendas, and Republicans have learned that what once seemed to play well in Washington does not ring many bells elsewhere.
In recent weeks, a visitor could sit through Rotary Club luncheons in Iowa or New Hampshire and barely hear mention of the deficit. And suddenly a struggle is on to redefine the party's economic priorities, to choose between the shrink-the-Government approach that House Republicans have championed since the 1994 midterm elections and the economic growth messages that Republican candidates for President seem to believe are what the voters want to hear in the 1996 race. 
 Indeed, the only idea that Patrick J. Buchanan and Steve Forbes have in common is to treat the deficit as something akin to the dirty remnants of a big snowstorm -- an eyesore that will melt away once the country changes its economic climate. And now even Senator Bob Dole, jolted into new tactics by Mr. Buchanan's strong finish in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, is shifting gears. After talking for weeks about the economic elixir of a balanced budget, Mr. Dole began talking yesterday about stagnant wages and corporate layoffs, the populist issues that have propelled Mr. Buchanan's campaign.
Mr. Buchanan's message about the budget deficit is right out of the supply-side textbooks: "When you get good jobs that put $30 or $40 an hour in people's pockets, you solve the deficit. No one can tell me that the problems of the Federal deficit and the loss of these high-paying jobs are unrelated."
In the week before the Iowa caucuses, even supporters of Mr. Dole and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, the two candidates who built their entire economic platforms around balanced budgets, acknowledged that they were failing to address the anxieties workers feel about job insecurity and declining real incomes.
Speaking recently in Portsmouth, N.H., just before his last push in Iowa, Mr. Dole never mentioned those issues, even when he had the opportunity. Instead, opening a biotechnology laboratory, he recounted his role in the budget process and compared his insider's knowledge of Washington to a corporate engineer's understanding of "how to put together all those pipes and make something useful come out." That drew tepid applause.
"I'm surprised that he has been unable to talk about real economic issues," Bob Wynn, a Portsmouth businessman who has abandoned Mr. Dole for Mr. Forbes, said after listening to the majority leader speak to the Rotary Club. "They don't seem to be his primary concern."
Until his shift in tactics yesterday, Mr. Dole had consistently declined to change the nature of his message or talk about economic strategy in anything other than vague generalities. He never mentioned corporate downsizings, or trade accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he supported. And whenever he was asked about specific proposals like Mr. Forbes's flat tax, he would briefly discuss the pluses and minuses and then declare that Congress should hold hearings.
"We're trying to talk about our issues, not theirs," said David Carney, a New Hampshire coordinator for Mr. Dole. But Mr. Carney conceded that Mr. Buchanan and his message were "stronger here than most people think."
Mr. Buchanan maintains that the Congressional Republicans have focused on the wrong issues. "Let's face it, people want some romance and drama in their politics," he said recently in between campaign stops in Iowa, where he railed against the exporting of jobs to China and Mexico and what he portrayed as Nafta's evils. "So what has this party spent the past year talking about?"
Then, with a long laugh, and using the abbreviation Washington insiders fling around for the Congressional Budget Office, he answered his own question: "A balanced budget in seven years based on C.B.O. numbers."
"Now, who outside of wonk-land in Washington knows what C.B.O. numbers are?" he continued. "Balanced budgets are not something you go to the barricades for. But if you talk about losing national sovereignty or creating an America that once again makes radios and TV's and becomes the world's manufacturing powerhouse, people come out of their chairs."
It is too early to tell whether Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Forbes will force a broad change in Republican economic strategy. But if Mr. Dole continues to pursue his rivals' themes, then a shift seems inevitable, particularly now that Mr. Gramm has faded from the race.
"There is a kind of quiet rethinking among Republicans about whether balancing the budget is enough of a message," said William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, who is one of the party's more influential strategists. "Whatever one thinks of the Forbes and Buchanan plans, they do address the wage stagnation problems, the job uncertainties. They have very different solutions, but each is addressing the concerns of middle-class America in ways that Bob Dole's balanced-budget talk does not."
But Mr. Kristol added that he had reservations about following either Mr. Forbes's strategy or Mr. Buchanan's too zealously. "The flat tax and protectionism are both political traps for the party," he said. "The question is whether Dole or Alexander can develop some alternative message about economic growth."
One quandary for Mr. Dole is whether a shift to a new agenda resembling those of his rivals could look credible. In the Senate, he has been a traditional free-trader, arguing against exactly the kind of steps Mr. Buchanan advocates: tariffs on imports from Asia, a halt to immigration for the next five years, renunciation of American participation in the World Trade Organization. (Mr. Dole struck the deal with President Clinton in late 1994 that assured passage of the global trade accord that created the W.T.O. as the arbiter of world trading rules.)
And after championing an ever smaller Federal Government -- which is what the balanced-budget issue was all about -- Mr. Dole could have problems advocating an activist agenda of retraining programs to aid distressed workers; his tendency is to advocate market solutions.
"He is really in a squeeze, because he needs Buchanan's supporters and yet he knows that he can't move too much into that turf," one of Mr. Clinton's political advisers said recently, clearly enjoying the moment.
He may have little choice: New Hampshire is Mr. Buchanan's strongest ground. While the state has enjoyed an exporting boom, some of its biggest high-tech employers have shipped jobs abroad. That makes the state fertile ground for Mr. Buchanan's stock speech about "corporate executioners" who "worship at the altar of efficiency" and lay off American workers.
Mr. Dole does not yet have economic applause lines like that. But there is every indication that his speechwriters will be drafting them in the next few days.

Proposals for Charity Care

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The New Jersey Hospital Association said its members have already provided $60 million in unreimbursed care to poor patients since funds set aside for charity care ran out Dec. 31. Three Democratic Assembly members, led by Neil M. Cohen of Elizabeth, the deputy minority leader, said they had come up with a solution to the crisis and would propose today that $200 million for charity-care reimbursements be made available from the state's general fund. 
 But Assemblyman Walter J. Kavanaugh, a Somerville Republican who chairs the Appropriations Committee, said he prefers to use money from the state's Unemployment Insurance Fund, while reducing the cost of charity care.

As his stretch limousine waited outside the State House, the actor Bruce Willis met with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman yesterday to talk about a project. Not a project of the star-studded Hollywood kind, but rather his planned multimillion-dollar investment in Penns Grove, an economically distressed Delaware River community in Salem County. Mr. Willis, who graduated from Penns Grove High School and grew up in nearby Carneys Point, bought 11 waterfront acres in Penns Grove last year.

But shifting population patterns will also mean that minority residents and immigrants -- the fastest-growing segment of the population -- will need to be helped past the barriers of language and discrimination that now hinder their full participation.
 The plan thus advocates two tracks that on some levels appear to conflict. It says that strenuous efforts must be made to help immigrants and minority group members assimilate into the mainstream economy through education, job training and the learning of English. But at the same time, it urges recognition and encouragement of the informal economy that operates in many ethnic neighborhoods off the tax rolls and often in violation of various laws. 
 The plan also envisions a new kind of job information network that would help poor inner-city residents learn about job opportunities, and a campaign to push for immigration changes that would encourage more skilled immigrants with work-related visas to move to the region. A regional council of business, government and community leaders should be formed to guide the creation of a lifelong learning system, the plan says. THOMAS J. LUECK

HEADLINE: Highlights of the Report by the Regional Plan Association: Centers;
Strengthening The Urban Cores

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The long-term vitality of the region as a whole is inextricably tied to the health of its urban downtowns, from the central business district of midtown Manhattan to the urban cores of Bridgeport, Conn., and Newark, the Regional Plan Association said in its report. These business centers must not only be desirable places to live and work in the 21st century, but must also be better linked with each other through a more interconnected transit system.
Lower Manhattan and the financial services centers in Jersey City and Long Island City, Queens, must all be better connected by rail service, the plan maintains, to assure the region's pre-eminence as a global financial center. Growth must be channeled into the downtown areas throughout the region to preserve open space, reduce transportation needs and create jobs. 
 This so-called centers campaign would cost about $17 billion, according to the plan, with most of that money going to housing initiatives to encourage moderate-income home ownership in these downtown areas. Improving the housing stock for moderate-income buyers would strengthen these centers economically, the plan contends, as big corporations in the region continue to retool into smaller, leaner organizations that depend on the labor that these residential areas can provide.
Historic preservation and encouragement of the arts will further strengthen the centers, but the plan also calls for gradually encouraging companies to locate in the urban downtowns. KIRK JOHNSON

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Is it science or voodoo? Seeking economics' true role.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
GEORGE BUSH had a problem with the vision thing, which helped seal his fate as a one-term President. Economists have a similar problem, contend Robert Heilbroner and William Milberg, colleagues at the New School for Social Research and authors of "The Crisis of Vision in Modern Economic Thought" (Cambridge University Press). And while the voters haven't specifically been asked what they think of economists, they have indirectly expressed their views on the subject by bolstering the fortunes of Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes, Republican candidates who have made campaign issues of their contempt for mainstream economics.
Many practitioners see their point. The annual meeting of the American Economic Association last month was dominated by existential hand-wringing, only partly induced by the decline in undergraduate economics majors and the collapse in demand for newly minted economists in both business and academia. 
 It is far from clear, though, that many would agree with the Heilbroner-Milberg prescription for redemption: an acknowledgment that economics is less a science than a running dog to capitalist ideology, along with a new focus on making government work as the defender of capitalism from its own excesses.
Macroeconomics, the study of what makes whole economies tick and what the public generally identifies as economics, is plainly in trouble. Fiscal fine-tuning to keep the economy on an even course, built around the ideas of John Maynard Keynes, reigned supreme in the 1960's -- it was Richard M. Nixon, after all, who said "we are all Keynesians now." But the failure of the economics establishment to cope with the oil shocks of the 1970's and the subsequent bouts of stagflation opened Keynesianism to challenges from which it has never recovered.
In what at first appeared to be a drive for a new grand synthesis, economists led by Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago tried to reconcile beliefs about the causes and cures for unemployment and inflation with the likely behavior of individuals and businesses. What they ended up with was a recipe for nihilism.
In some cases "rational expectations" models predicted that the private sector response would fully offset government policy initiatives -- a tax cut today, for example, would lead individuals to save more to cover their share of the higher taxes needed in the future to pay interest on the Federal debt. In other cases, rational expectations models suggest that the private sector response could even be perverse, exacerbating a problem that Government policy was designed to solve.
Consider the implications: if the reactions of private markets to government intervention are inherently fluky, there was little basis for predicting the future and virtually none for fine-tuning the economy. "They destroyed macroeconomics," concludes James Tobin of Yale, who, like Robert Lucas, won a Nobel prize for investigating the Keynesian framework.
To Mr. Heilbroner and Mr. Milberg this is cause for abandoning the pretense that economics is a science and accepting the role of pragmatic guardian of The System -- what they call "a general recognition of the need for expanded public intervention to protect the capitalist order from the difficulties and dangers with which it will have to contend." But to Mr. Tobin, one does not follow from the other.
While he agrees that it is reasonable for economics to serve as the superego of capitalism, there remains a conventional job to be done -- a job that depends on economists using scientific methods to make decisions about what sort of intervention works, when. And while many academics and the journals they write for are deep into navel-gazing, "economists at the Congressional Budget Office, the White House and the Federal Reserve still have to come up with forecasts and recommendations for government policy," Mr. Tobin says, "and they still must use modified Keynesian models to do it."
What's more, he argues, the predictions do a whole lot better than a roll of the dice.
The world's opinion of economists has certainly changed since the heady days of the 1960's. While it was tempting to think of economics as an exact science in the making, macroeconomics is, and always was, a messier matter. Policy economics is a compromise: guesswork educated by theory and statistical evidence.
But there is a curious symbiosis between critics of the right, who see the limitations of Keynesian economics as a rationale for abandoning interventionist policy, and critics of the left like Mr. Heilbroner and Mr. Milberg, who see them as a rationale for abandoning economists' pretense to objectivity and worship of science.
Economics is a tent big enough to accommodate both Robert Lucas and Robert Heilbroner. But the center ring is still occupied by economists who worry about the implications of lower interest rates or bigger budget deficits, and advise accordingly.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Political Void in Italy Drives Up The Mark, Hurting the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The German mark strengthened yesterday on the heels of Italian political problems, dragging down the dollar in the process.
The dollar fell against the mark as the German currency and the Swiss franc benefited from Italy's inability to form a new government. The mark, Europe's strongest economy, and the Swiss franc typically attract investment in times of political and economic uncertainty. 
 The mark's strength drew enough support from the dollar to leave it lower against the Japanese yen, as well. Big buyers declined to support the dollar.
Political uncertainty in Italy increased after the Prime Minister-designate, Antonio Maccanico, abandoned a two-week effort to form a government, leaving the country in yet another leadership crisis. The next move is up to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who, for the third time in a year, can either call early elections or name another leader to try to form a government.
The Milan stock exchange's main index dropped 3.62 percent yesterday. The mark continued a surge against the Italian lira that began on Tuesday, rising 1.5 percent yesterday. The dollar also rose against the lira, to 1,583, from 1,575 lire on Tuesday.
But the dollar did not fare as well against other currencies. In New York late yesterday, it traded at 1.4644 marks, down from 1.4730 on Tuesday. It finished at 106.25 yen, compared with 106.81 yen the day before. The British pound rose to $1.5419 from $1.5367
The mark also gained strength yesterday because of continuing doubts that the first stage of European monetary union would be in place by 1999, as planned.
Another factor was the decline yesterday of some stock and bond indexes in the United States -- failing to provide a boost to the currency needed to buy them. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 21.68 points, and the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond also declined, driving up the yield to 6.09 percent.
"The dollar has been acting in a negative fashion all week, said Tom O'Malley, a senior foreign exchange analyst for Technical Data in Boston. "The market is looking for fresh data to come to the rescue."
In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.1955 Swiss francs, from 1.2027 Swiss francs on Tuesday, and to 5.0460 French francs, down from 5.0715 francs.

HEADLINE: Imam's Progress, Secular and Sacred;
Guiding a Harlem Congregation Past Crises of Debt and Faith

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
On his deathbed, Ali Rashid, the imam of the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque in Harlem, scribbled down the name of his successor. It was the same name he had secretly added to mosque documents months before his death: Izak-El M. Pasha.
"I didn't know enough Arabic to lead the prayer and was still a student of the Koran," recalled Mr. Pasha, a plumber who as imam would be leader, teacher and spiritual healer to one of the nation's oldest black Muslim communities. "I knew how to be a servant of God, but to lead a people whose spirit was down? No siree!" 
 He contemplated leaving town with his wife and three children.
Mr. Pasha, 46, remembers crying that night in February 1993 when he submitted to the "will of Allah" to guide the orthodox Sunni Muslim sect, which had been divided for decades by internal squabbles, financial debt and a crisis of faith, a legacy of its break from the Nation of Islam in the 1970's. By the 1990's, the congregation had dwindled to 700.
"I told the community that if I accepted, it would have to be a 'we' leadership, not a 'me' leadership," said Mr. Pasha, who proceeded to quit his job as a supervisor at the Par Plumbing Company in Lynbrook, L.I. "It would take all of us working together to bring about a success, a new spirit and a new dawning."
Today, the mosque, where Malcolm X preached and Louis Farrakhan once delivered his fiery oratory on black supremacy, has again become a civic and economic presence in Harlem, with 8,000 worshipers.
Mr. Pasha is credited with turning around the fortunes of the mosque, a landmark gold-domed house of worship at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, and he is being called Harlem's new spokesman, not only for religious doctrine but also for secular issues of concern to blacks.
In 1994, Mr. Pasha quietly mediated a potentially volatile dispute between store owners and illegal vendors along 125th Street. Last month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who called the imam a "messenger who unites people," became the first incumbent Mayor to visit the 52-year-old mosque. These days, the imam is working on an ambitious project for the mosque and its neighborhood.
"I'm putting together a 175-year plan, which I consider a first phase," he said the other day, settling into a worn burgundy leather chair in his modest sixth-floor office. "People ask me, 'Where are you going to be in 175 years,' and I say, 'I'll live in my grands and great-grands.' You have to start thinking like that."
Mr. Pasha's office is crammed with diagrams, renderings and clay models of Harlem, replete with a magnificent new mosque, a 475-room hotel with a 1,600-seat banquet room and 2,800-seat concert hall, a mall and 190-unit low-income apartment complex. The first phase of the plan -- a joint project of the mosque and four nonprofit Harlem development groups -- is to cost $1 billion, financed through donations and state and Federal money. Mr. Pasha would not say how much has been raised so far.
But ground is to be broken next month on the apartment complex, the Malcolm Shabazz Gardens, on 117th Street. The mosque, which would manage the projects, is also working with the Harlem Community Development Corporation to build 85 units of federally subsidized housing for the elderly.
The imam, who has the intimidating bulk of a wrestler offset by an easy smile, has become known for such enterpreneurial spirit but also for grass-roots diplomacy. When two followers came to him with complaints about their wives, Mr. Pasha picked up the phone and called the women.
"Hold on for a minute," he said. "I have someone here that needs to speak to you about a problem he's having."
The Mayor's office itself appealed to Mr. Pasha to help defuse the dispute with 125th Street sidewalk vendors, many of them mosque members who, merchants complained, were siphoning off their customers. The city's attempts to move the vendors failed until Mr. Pasha began preaching compromise during juma, or Friday prayer services. At the city's behest, the mosque agreed to manage a market on a city-owned parking lot across from the mosque.
"The way he handled the vendors situation and the tremendous job the mosque is doing operating the market is evidence of what the imam means to this community," said Warren S. Whitlock, deputy executive director of the Harlem Community Development Corporation. "The imam and his worshipers believe in a self-reliance philosophy. They're working to help the black community here understand the importance of that message."
Mr. Pasha called the tensions between the vendors, most of them recent immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean, and the store merchants a cultural clash best handled through moral persuasion and a mild rebuke.
"We have as much racism practiced among us as black people as any racism that has been practiced upon us by other groups," he said. "The African doesn't like the Jamaican. The Jamaican doesn't like the Trinidadian. The black American doesn't like the non-American black.
"Islam won't accept racism, and won't allow Muslims to practice it."
Mr. Pasha sounded a similarly impatient note about racial discord when people questioned his motives in inviting Mayor Giuliani to speak just a few days before the holy month of Ramadan. Some perceived it as grandstanding on the imam's part. Others suggested that the mosque had been used by the Mayor to placate blacks angry over his bickering with the Rev. Al Sharpton.
"Sometimes, leadership in Harlem treats African-American people like children, fraidy-cats," Mr. Pasha said. "Like if some white man talks to us, we're going to be led back into slavery. We have a constituency and I'm obligated to bring those they elect to them. We respect leadership, that's our way. All that other stuff about 'he said this about him,' leave it outside. I don't want to hear."
Though conservative in manner, the imam, who favors flannel shirts and corduroy trousers, is a product of the radical 1960's, having spent much of his youth rebelling against a society he viewed as oppressive toward blacks. The fourth of nine children in a Bedford-Stuyvesant family, he dropped out of high school and took up with gangs. A life of hopelessness, he said, was given new hope when his oldest brother, Ali, persuaded him in 1972 to join the Nation of Islam, the regimented religious group that subscribed to racial separation.
At the time, the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque was Temple No. 7, a popular, politically active mosque following the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam. It was at Temple No. 7 that Malcolm X, the movement's most famous convert, preached the new black man's religion and nationalism.
Mr. Pasha, who received a high school equivalency diploma, worked his way up through the ranks, first by selling fried fish and the group's newspaper, Muhammad Speaks, on street corners, turning 10 percent over to the mosque.
In 1978, after Elijah Muhammad's death, the Nation of Islam splintered into two factions. One was led by Mr. Farrakhan, who replaced Malcolm X as minister of Temple No. 7 before moving to Chicago to assume national leadership. The other was headed by W. Deen Muhammad, a son of Elijah Muhammad, who had softened his position in later years and moved the Nation closer to more traditional Islam.
Mr. Pasha's own beliefs had changed over the years, and he chose the latter path. In the 1980's, Temple 7 was renamed Malcolm Shabazz in honor of the slain leader. Mr. Farrakhan's followers went to the Nation of Islam Mosque at 125th Street and Fifth Avenue.
Mr. Pasha speaks of Minister Farrakhan in the kind of hushed tones reserved for an estranged brother. "Some of us were able to see that in real Islam racism is not accepted," he said. "Others did not."
During the next 10 years, a legal battle over Elijah Muhammad's estate further fractured the spirit of his followers, and the need to pay his back taxes forced many followers to sell properties to prevent foreclosure on mosques, including the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque. Its restaurants and other projects were shut. Mr. Pasha has paid most of $1 million owed in taxes.
To insure that a new generation stay the prescribed course of Islam, the mosque now operates a school for 70 students that teaches Islamic culture, along with English, Arabic, Spanish and French, American history and algebra. A new restaurant and health food store are doing steady business in once-vacant storefronts adjoining the mosque.
As the solemn call to prayer washed over the mosque, Mr. Pasha excused himself to pray. He returned to find a representative from City Hall waiting in his office. The mosque's financial officer and Mr. Pasha's brother Ali were waiting in an adjoining room. And he is reminded by his secretary, his oldest daughter, that he promised to fix a leak in the mosque's basement.

HEADLINE: Tribe Says Developer Threatens Sacred Site

 BODY:
For more than 1,000 years, archaeologists say, the Mohican Indians lived on land in the Catskills community of Leeds, N.Y. The tribe has long since left the area, settling in Wisconsin, but its lawyer returned yesterday to fight plans to build a Wal-Mart superstore on a 30-acre cornfield the tribe considers sacred.
The tribe contends that the Town of Catskill, which includes Leeds, conducted only a cursory archaeological review before granting a zone change requested by Wal-Mart. It filed suit yesterday in Greene County Court to block construction of the store. 
 "We're asking the court to restrain the town from moving forward on this project until the archaeological work is complete," said George Rodenhausen, the lawyer representing the tribe. He added that the Town of Catskill and Wal-Mart had been unresponsive to requests to protect the site, where preliminary excavations have turned up a wealth of artifacts.
"What we're talking about here are whole deposits of artifacts that have been sealed in by the flood plains," said Dr. Christopher Lindner, an archaeologist with Bard College. "If we had to pick a wish list, it couldn't be better than this." The cornfield lies next to a stream and abuts the site of a historic Dutch trading post. Dr. Lindner said the site could merit a full-fledged archaeological dig, which could cost more than $1 million.
The battle here is part of a nationwide fight over Indian archaeology. Backed by recent political gains, the wealth from casinos on Indian reservations and no small dose of moral indignation, American Indians are increasingly trying to reclaim pieces of their heritage, forcing developers and local administrators to balance economic growth against the cost of destroying sites spiritually significant to Indians.
"You find it from Alaska to the Virgin Islands," said Dr. Muriel Crespi, an Indian specialist with the National Park Service. "The confluence of legislation, public awareness and a more politically sophisticated Indian people is changing the scenario."
According to Dr. Robert Kuhn, the program coordinator for the State Historic Preservation Office, which oversees the 10,000 archaeological sites in New York State, the Hudson Valley has become particularly fertile ground for these kinds of conflicts.
Once the home of the Mohican tribe, the area from Lake Champlain to Manhattan has also been one of the most heavily developed regions in the Northeast. Those two competing interests, Dr. Kuhn said, pit expensive excavations against low-cost development.
"In each of these projects, we have to balance that," Dr. Kuhn said. "Our goal is to find a way that the project can go forward and still protect the resource. In many instances, there are ways to do both."
In Leeds, however, the lawsuit came after negotiations with the retailer had stalled. Wal-Mart officials canceled a January meeting at the tribe's Bowler, Wisc., reservation and turned down a Mohican offer to use proceeds from their casino there to buy out the company's option on the land, said Steven Davids, vice-chairman of the tribal council.
"We want to learn from this site," Mr. Davids said. "If an excavation is to occur, we want it to be full and thorough. We don't want it rushed so they can get a Wal-Mart in there."
Wal-Mart officials did not returned phone calls yesterday. But earlier, Betsy Reithemeyer, a spokeswoman for the retailer, said it had consistently worked with Indian groups on preservation issues. She cited efforts to preserve a burial mound at a Wal-Mart in Paso Robles, Calif., as well as an artifact display at a store built on an Indian site in Canton, Ga. She also said the company would await the results of the next round of state-mandated excavations, scheduled for this spring, before making any decisions on the land.
The lawsuit, however, could become an interesting test case for Wal-Mart, which has often been at odds with local communities over development plans. Part of the suit contends that the Catskill Town Board did not fully consider the economic impact of the superstore on Leeds and surrounding communities.
"Historically, Wal-Mart has been a predator," said Michael Smith, a member of "It's Not Easy Being Greene," a preservation group formed to fight the development, which first notified the Mohicans of the site's significance. Mr. Smith, a lawyer in Manhattan who grew up in Leeds and has a weekend home there, complained that Wal-Mart monopolizes local business by driving prices down and forcing out small merchants. In addition to the Mohican tribe, two members of the preservation group are plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
In this historic community, though, some residents say Wal-Mart is needed to bolster a flagging tourism economy. In December, the County Board of Legislators passed a resolution unanimously supporting the retailer's plans.
"It's a very sensitive issue, and the Town of Catskill will take great care to recognize the rights of all the parties involved," said Joseph Izzo, the Catskill Town Supervisor, who said he had not yet seen a copy of the lawsuit. "It is a very important economic issue, too, though."

HEADLINE: The Divorce Debate

 BODY:
Led by conservative Christian groups, a new movement is afoot to toughen state divorce laws. Its main target is the "no-fault" divorce statutes adopted by every state over the last 25 years to make divorces easier, quicker and less freighted with destructive recrimination.
There are powerful reasons to be alarmed about the impact of family breakups on children, and about the high incidence of poverty in single-parent households. But rolling back the clock to make the legal process of divorce more expensive and acrimonious is not a useful answer. 
 Supporters of tougher divorce laws complain that the current rules encourage a casual attitude toward the dissolution of marriage. But few people who have lived through a no-fault divorce, especially those with children, would say they took the step lightly.
Even though divorces have jumped about 30 percent in the last 25 years, blaming the new laws for a long-term upward trend confuses cause and effect. No-fault divorce was a response to changes already taking place in the family system.
Under the no-fault approach, a divorce is granted even if only one spouse wants it. By contrast, a bill just introduced in the Michigan Legislature would deny a divorce when one spouse opposes it unless the plaintiff could show that a spouse had been physically or mentally abusive, had a problem with alcohol or drugs, had committed adultery, had deserted the home or had been sentenced to prison.
The idea is to try to force couples to stay together. But a more likely consequence would be a return to the perjuries, fabrications and other devices required to obtain divorces before no-fault. That would mean yet more pain for children, as parents slug it out in a prolonged legal blame-game, wasting scarce family resources in the process.
Another consequence would be to discourage couples from getting married in the first place -- thereby aggravating the already staggering problem of unwed motherhood, and the resulting social and financial vulnerability of women and children.
The nation should be concentrating on ways to reduce the economic stresses that experts say contribute both to the high divorce rate and to the rising number of children born to unmarried couples. Absent fathers should be required to live up to their child support obligations. But making it more difficult for people to escape a broken marriage seems cruel and counter-productive.

HEADLINE: New Hampshire Passion Play

 BODY:
If Iowa's Presidential caucuses tested the candidates' appeal to the religious right, next week's New Hampshire primary shapes up as a test of economic platforms. So the focus will be on the flat-tax fantasies of Steve Forbes and especially the faux populism of Pat Buchanan. Although both men are capable of veering toward the wacky, it is a debate worth having.
The exercise will test the ability of Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander to respond substantively to Mr. Buchanan's simplistic, but highly emotive harangues. Also, the economic debate will test the Republicans' ability to respond to the discontent of their grass-roots participants in the economy after two decades of listening to the party's theorists and its fat cats. 
 Mr. Buchanan's radar is good. He understands the middle-class concern over the growing gap between rich and poor, the stagnation of buying power and the uncertainty of future employment. But his remedies are perverse. His platform is anti-immigration, anti-trade and anti-corporation. Contrary to the workers'-solidarity rhetoric he was using Wednesday in New Hampshire, it is also anti-poor and anti-worker.
Mr. Buchanan can pose as the working man's fiery friend, but his tax plan is a boon to the haves. His own flat-tax reform plan, while more balanced than Mr. Forbes's, would exempt the interest gains and stock dividends of individual investors from taxation. He wants to give investors a tax holiday on capital gains income and eliminate inheritance tax for estates up to $5 million.
His tax plan, in short, would stuff the pocketbooks of the affluent, while his trade policies would squeeze the purse of the average consumer. He calls for imposing punitive tariffs on goods from China, Japan and low-wage countries. He would withdraw from Nafta, the trade accord with Mexico and Canada, as well as the World Trade Organization, which oversees fair trade rules. He would close America's borders to immigrants for five years.
At the core of these positions is the notion that foreigners are the root cause of America's economic slowdown. That is a notion in search of evidence. Mr. Buchanan's tariffs would not create more jobs -- the Federal Reserve Board has more effect on employment -- but it would jack up the price of low-priced clothes and food that America imports, a blow to the budgets of poor families.
He seeks to give the impression that if these low-priced goods were not on the market, there would be more manufacturing jobs for unskilled laborers. That is a neat, but misleading formulation. In certain situations, imports and immigration do threaten low-skilled workers, even if they help other low-wage consumers. But what Mr. Buchanan rejects are the reams of evidence that the plight of America's unskilled workers -- wage declines and small benefit increases for two decades -- is a home-grown problem that bears a scanty relationship to foreign trade, investment or immigration.
The remedy for slow-growing wages is faster growth of productivity in the American workplace. That turnaround will not be achieved by bashing foreigners, but instead must be accomplished in an expensive, persistent campaign to drive up savings and investment as well as worker education and training. If Mr. Buchanan preached that, he would sound remarkably like President Clinton.
Of course, it may not be possible for Mr. Dole and Mr. Alexander to make such reasoned points when Mr. Buchanan is in his blowtorch mode. Mr. Dole and Mr. Alexander seem to hope that they can intone their usual pieties about small government and the respective virtues of having a lot of Washington experience or only a little bit, and then leave it up to the voters to fill in the blanks. But for the moment, Mr. Buchanan is filling in the blanks, usually with passionate nonsense. His is not a new strategy for Presidential primaries nor, in the light of history, necessarily an unsuccessful one.

HEADLINE: The End of Taiwan?

BYLINE: By Chas. Freeman 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
No one wants a war in the Taiwan Strait. Not President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, whose hopes for re-election on March 23 depend on convincing voters he can still manage relations with Beijing to the island's advantage. Not Jiang Zemin, China's President, who just a year ago emphasized China's patience in pursuing peaceful reunification. Not Bill Clinton, who doesn't want his handling of China to be an issue in this year's Presidential campaign.
But Taiwan's miscalculations, China's emotional reactions and the United States' inattention have created tensions that could escalate into combat soon after Taiwan's election. Such a war would not only threaten Taiwan's democracy but also finish any hopes of America's building a constructive relationship with China. It could even destroy our alliance with Japan. 
 Mr. Lee, who faces tremendous pressure from voters to push for separation from China, will likely be re-elected. Beijing believes that he is committed to separatism, and since last summer has been conducting extensive military exercises in the Taiwan Strait to make clear the price of a call for independence.
China would rather not go to war. The People's Liberation Army is not now capable of conquering Taiwan -- an island fortress with a well-trained army and cutting-edge weaponry. There is no reason to believe that Beijing's generals are stupid enough to try.
But Taiwan is heavily dependent on trade, making it vulnerable to escalating military harassment. The Chinese Army has made plans, including carefully selecting targets for missile attacks, to carry out such a campaign. At the same time, China could begin the long effort to train its troops for conquest and to build the sorts of ships, amphibious landing craft and aircraft it would need to invade. Taiwan can win a battle or two, but not a protracted test of strength.
Few leaders in Beijing -- civilian or military -- can doubt the potential for disaster in a conflict with Taiwan. Beyond the obvious risks of war, China could face economic sanctions and possibly military intervention by the West. War in the Taiwan Strait could also cause Japan to arm against China.
Like many other Asian nations, Japan is dismayed by the absence of effective American leadership. Since World War II, the price of Japan's disarmament has been reliable American management of its strategic defense.
If America failed to come to Taiwan's aid, many Japanese would demand that they take over their own defense, claiming that America could no longer be counted on to fulfill its responsibility.
If, however, the United States did intervene in a war between Taiwan and the People's Republic -- either by supplying Taiwan's forces or actual military action -- it would have to use its bases in Japan, thus forcing Japan to choose between its nonhostile relationship with China and its alliance with the United States. Japan would almost certainly side with us, but no future Japanese government would allow itself to be put in such a position again.
The results in either case would probably be Japanese rearmament, military rivalry between Tokyo and Beijing, a loss of confidence between Tokyo and Washington and alarm throughout Asia.
What can the United States do? Sino-American relations have collapsed since the fall of the Soviet Union. Congress has filled the policy vacuum with gestures against Beijing: forcing President Clinton to issue visas to Taiwanese leaders; passing legislation supporting Tibet's secession from China and calling for a bill to finance a radio station for Chinese dissidents.
It has been years since the executive branch conducted an effective dialogue with Taiwan's leaders, who have fallen into the habit of lobbying Congress and have usually received what they wanted.
The Clinton Administration must forge a coherent China policy and persuade Congress not to undercut it. We should firmly remind Taiwan that it does not have a blank check that it can fill out in American blood, but also firmly remind China that it cannot count on us to stay out if it goes to war with Taiwan.
Then we must begin a constructive dialogue with China. A first step would be to stop blackballing its entry into groups such as the World Trade Organization. Unless we make China a member of the club, we can't hope to hold it to the rules.
Even on the most rancorous issue between the nations -- human rights -- there is room for cooperation. China has recognized the need to create a modern legal system. Congress should finance an effort by American and Asian experts to help China build a rule of law that can eliminate abuses.
Although Bill Clinton may wish to avoid having to devote time to China in an election year, too much is at stake in the Taiwan Strait for him to ignore it.

HEADLINE: What's Next, Tail Fins?;
Fast Speeds and Big Cars Send Gas Consumption Up

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: MANLIUS, N.Y.

 BODY:
Gas guzzling is back.
Americans are driving bigger cars and trucks longer distances and at higher speeds -- ignoring warnings about increased pollution or another oil shock. 
 And why not? Gas costs less, in inflation-adjusted terms, than at any time since the 1950's, the golden era of gas guzzling, when metallic monsters with fins spewed noxious fumes and got 10 miles to the gallon in city traffic.
Today, gas is so cheap that Mary McIntosh never looks at the price signs when she goes to fill up the 40-gallon tank of her hulking Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicle. She just pulls the truck, which seats nine people, into the first Mobil station she sees -- because she has a Mobil credit card.
"I zip it through and that's it," she said in her living room here as her husband, David, who drives his own Suburban, nodded in approval. The convenience is well worth the few dollars the couple might save from their $200 monthly gasoline bill if they shopped around, she added.
With price such a small consideration, the McIntoshes have no reason to drive slowly. In fact, now that nearly every state has lifted the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit on major rural highways, they -- like most Americans -- are going faster.
The McIntoshes say they sometimes exceed 70 m.p.h. on the weekend skiing trips they take with their four children to Stowe, Vt., 200 miles away. And on some roads that would mean driving in the slow lane. The New York State Police says the average ticketed speed rose from 73 m.p.h. in 1994 to 76 m.p.h. last year.
Energy specialists say the McIntoshes' driving habits are typical these days. With memories of the oil shocks of the 1970's fading, the oil cartel apparently broken and prices generally stable over the last decade, they say, motorists have little incentive to conserve energy. Indeed, the gas mileage of their Suburbans, like most of the popular sport utility vehicles, is not much better than the monster gas guzzlers of old.
As a result, gasoline consumption is increasing at an accelerating pace, according to the American Petroleum Institute. After declining slightly from 1989 through 1991, it rose by 1.1 percent in 1992, 1.4 percent in 1993 and 1.7 percent in 1994 before shooting up 2.5 percent last year. Consumption was 327.2 million gallons a day in 1995, up from 319.2 million gallons in 1994.
The industry trade group attributed last year's jump partly to the introduction of reformulated gasoline, which delivers somewhat lower mileage. Actual highway travel rose at a slightly lower pace last year than in 1994 -- 2 percent versus 2.5 percent.
Analysts believe consumption will continue to rise, perhaps at an accelerating rate. Fred Leuffer, an oil analyst for Bear, Stearns, the securities firm, predicts a 2 percent increase this year and stronger growth for the next five years. Making matters worse, he said, "We're going to see much smaller gains in fuel efficiency."
The abandon with which Americans are hitting the gas pedal worries both environmentalists and strategic planners. John M. DeCicco, a senior associate for the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research and lobbying group in Washington that urges energy conservation, calculates that a car loses 18 percent of its mileage if it increases its speed to 65 miles per hour from 55 m.p.h. and a whopping 33 percent if it guns along at 75 m.p.h.
In contrast to the 1950's, today's cars are equipped with catalytic converters that greatly reduce pollution. Still, Mr. DeCicco worries that all the gas guzzling will wipe out some of the gains from the recent switch to cleaner gasoline in cities with high ozone levels, like New York and Los Angeles. "It's going to make it harder for some states to be in compliance" with ozone limits set by the Federal Clean Air Act, he said.
Some experts fear Americans are getting dangerously complacent. Granted, they say, oil output is up in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. And granted, recent finds in Colombia are being brought into production, and Iraq stands a good chance of getting sanctions against its exports relaxed.
But some specialists worry that the United States is once again ignoring the risk of becoming increasingly dependent on foreign supplies. Imports, which add about $50 billion to the nation's trade deficit, have been rising steadily in recent years and now account for about half of oil consumption. And if political upheavals should ever disrupt production in the key exporting nation of Saudi Arabia, they say, the threat of another shortage would be real.
"We're better off than a lot of countries, but we're poorly prepared," said Milton Copulos, the president of the National Defense Council Foundation, a conservative group in Washington that has warned of another oil crisis in hearings in Congress. "We have done so many things that place ourselves at risk that getting out of it will be difficult, especially when there is not the public will to do the things that need to be done."
The 1990's nonchalance couldn't be more different from the conservationist fervor that swept the nation after the Arab oil embargo of 1973 created long gas lines and sent pump prices soaring.
Trying to come to grips with that crisis, which Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called the "economic equivalent of the Sputnik challenge," the Senate passed a bill to require higher fuel efficiency in cars, highway speed limits were lowered and service stations were closed on Sundays in some places.
There was talk of rationing gasoline, and President Nixon asked drivers to hold purchases to 10 gallons. The Mobil Oil Company and other oil giants halted gasoline advertising, and with surprising speed, consumers shifted to smaller cars.
Today, the forces of both the marketplace and the work place seem to be conspiring to erase Americans' former energy austerity.
Millions of Americans, like the McIntoshes, find that the cost of gasoline barely dents their budgets. Adjusted for inflation, the current average price of $1.14 for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline is only half what it was in the early 1980's.
And while most drivers were already exceeding the 55 m.p.h. limit, the increase to 65 m.p.h. in states like New York and even higher in several Western states spurred them to go faster. On a recent trip from Nyack, N.Y. to Syracuse on the New York State Thruway, for example, many cars were spotted speeding along at 75 m.p.h.
"I don't worry about gas mileage, I worry about the troopers," said Ralph Miller as he and some friends ordered coffee at the takeout counter of a Thruway rest stop. He said he drove his white Toyota Land Cruiser, parked outside and bristling with skis, between 70 and 75 m.p.h.
Another restaurant customer, Frank Schiavelli, said he made a point of obeying the law by setting his cruise control for 65 m.p.h., only to find, he said, that "almost everybody was passing me." Mr. Schiavelli, a salesman, said he drives more and flies less these days because on short trips he can get there just as fast.
Gregory C. Sitler, a major in the Division of Traffic Services of the New York State Police, said once drivers got used to higher speeds they had trouble slowing down to comply with the lower 55 m.p.h. limit along heavily traveled stretches. "It's almost like it doesn't exist," he said.
New Jersey and Connecticut are among the handful of states that have not raised their 55 m.p.h. speed limits.
Meantime, the long-term trend away from using mass transit to get to work continues. Between 1980 and 1990, for example, when 18 million jobs were created, 22 million more commuters hit the highways rather than the train or bus -- usually driving alone.
Allen Pisarski, a consultant on traffic patterns in Falls Church, Va., who has long studied driving habits, said that shift was continuing. At the same time, he said, women are driving more, and now cover more miles than men. In part, that reflects their increasing presence in the workplace, but even housewives are making more trips, he said.
For Mrs. McIntosh, a typical day might including dropping off her daughter Sara, 11, and son David, 9, at school in the morning, then heading for the mall with Katherine, 6, and Patrick, 22 months. In the afternoon, she picks up the older children, drops Sara off for a violin lesson and then returns with David to take both of them to soccer practice. For his part, Mr. McIntosh, who has his own insurance business, goes on frequent hunting trips to Oneida Lake, 60 miles away from their home in Manlius, which is nine miles southeast of Syracuse.
The McIntoshes chose their Suburbans, which barely get 12 miles to the gallon in local traffic, two years ago because they were big enough to ferry their children and all their gear, and because the hefty size made Mrs. McIntosh feel safer, especially with a toddler in the car. "I know it's so American," she said. "It's big and has a lot of power."
Another factor whetting the national thirst for gasoline is the continuing suburbanization of America, making long drives essential to keeping in touch with friends. Wellington Sears, a 74-year-old retired engineer, drives 15 miles in his 1987 Lincoln to get free coffee and play bingo along with dozens of other retired people at the Caldor department store in the Fayetteville Mall near Syracuse. His wife drives her Mercury to the same bingo game, and afterward the two go separately to other malls to meet friends.
It burns a lot of gas, Mr. Sears concedes. "I don't care," he said. "I do my thing, she does hers."
Then, of course, there is the sheer fun of driving fast. Jerry Rubitski, a student on his way to Tufts University from Utica, said he loves to barrel along the New York Thruway at 75 m.p.h. in his BMW coupe while listening to loud music. Does he worry about gas mileage? "Not really," he said as he got behind the wheel.
And if big is beautiful for many American motorists, very big is back, too. An increasing number of people want to take their living room, kitchen and bathroom along when they travel, keeping demand strong for gas-hungry recreational vehicles. In the 1990's sales of these vehicles have grown dramatically, hitting a peak in 1994 and falling slightly last year.
Eric Rector, general manager of a dealership in Clifton Park, N.Y., walked through his cavernous showroom filled with gleaming white vehicles, which get as little as eight miles to the gallon on the open road. Stepping inside the $150,000 Sun Voyager, he showed how the 13-foot-long living room can be expanded when the vehicle is parked.
"People work hard," he said, "and they work to have fun."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Lose Steam; Prices Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the first time in three sessions as talk of selling by hedge funds and other distractions drove buyers to the sidelines in the absence of economic reports.
A decline in the value of the dollar, an increase in the issue of corporate bonds and rising commodity prices combined to weigh down the market. 
 "While a lot of things did bother the market, said Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist for CS First Boston, "there was no technical damage done, and there were no signals of a dramatic change to fundamentals or tone taking place now and over the near term."
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 28/32 , to 9822/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.09 percent, from 6.02 percent on Tuesday.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch, a New York market research and analysis firm, said an abundant amount of corporate debt was issued yesterday, adding to the market's concerns about supply.
In the corporate market, the largest domestic sale of the day was Salomon Inc.'s $500 million of notes due in 2003. The notes, with an interest rate of 6.75 percent, are priced at 99.798 to yield 6.787 percent, or 137.5 basis points more than a similar Treasury issue. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The noncallable issue is rated Baa-1 by Moody's, BBB by Standard & Poor's and A- by Duff & Phelps.
The Salomon issue was one of a total $1.275 billion in domestic offerings yesterday -- not including the Province of Ontario's $1.5 billion global issue of 10-year debt.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said the Ontario offering created more supply of securities that the market has to absorb, lowering interest rates to attract investors. That in turn brought some hedge funds, or large institutional investors, to sell securities to protect themselves from falling prices. Traders said some of the selling was to raise cash to pay for issues bought at last week's refunding. The weakness in the Treasury market yesterday began at the opening, after selling overseas. Weighing on prices and extending the day's lows were rumors of hedge funds selling short-term notes and a decline in the dollar against major currencies. A weak dollar makes American investments like Treasury securities less attractive to foreign investors.
Rising commodities prices were also a market distraction, although many participants do not see inflationary pressures building. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodity futures traded in New York and Chicago was up a point to 250.68, the higest level since January 1998.
Today, the market turns its attention to a number of economic reports, including orders for durable goods and factory orders for December and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's survey of regional business activity for February.
"The key report could be the Philadelphia Fed index," Mr. Palash of MCM Moneywatch said, "because it will give us the first indication of whether the manufacturing sector has rebounded from the effects of the East blizzard.
"If it stays negative it tells us that manufacturing remains weak and that leaves the door open for further easing. If stronger than I think it will just be chalked up to a weather-related rebound and have a limited impact on the market."

HEADLINE: In New Vision By Planners, An Open War On Old Ideas

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The Regional Plan Association, an old and respected urban planning organization that usually draws little attention to itself, has declared open war on some treasured ideas about the New York metropolitan region.
The group, after five years of study, issued a report on Tuesday concluding that the 31-county three-state region around New York City is at risk of a long-term decline in its economy and its quality of life unless dramatic steps are taken and billions of dollars are invested now in transportation, education and housing. The report was couched in language of darkest gloom, hinting that a centuries-long pattern of self-sustaining growth had perhaps come to an end. 
 But the very elements that give the study its force -- its sweeping, long-term vision and gloomy threats -- may also be the great stumbling blocks in selling it as a blueprint for where the region goes from here.
Politicians are likely to shy away from such a pessimistic view of the region's prospects, and many business leaders too tend to take a more promotional view of the area in which they have a stake.
While the planning group took the long view -- trying to peer a quarter-century into the future -- the time frame in which political and business leaders operate seems to grow shorter and shorter. It can often be difficult for them to look much beyond the next election or the next quarterly earnings report. And even if they were willing to, many say that the pace of technological and economic change today makes trying to look so far into the future an act of utter audacity.
"I think they've gone way out on a limb," Chris Biddle, a spokesman for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the state's largest business organization, said of the planning group. "Yes, it's true that New York and Connecticut and New Jersey share economies, and that we're at the center of corporate downsizing, losing jobs hand over fist, and that there are some serious problems -- but does this mean we're entering a tragic decline? I don't think you can draw that conclusion. I think there may be changes ahead we can't even anticipate."
The plan's authors concede that selling their vision in the late 20th century represents a whole different set of problems from those faced by earlier planners. In 1929 and even in 1968, for example -- the only other times that the association has issued long-term plans -- the New York business community was dominated by individual titans who could move mountains with a few telephone calls. Corporate leaders today, working for globally dispersed companies and answering to stockholders with short-term profit agendas, have less opportunity to focus on a broad civic agenda.
The era of conservative government -- with its goals of doing more with less -- has also left politicians less room to manuever. The capital-spending items urged in the 1996 plan, led by mass-transit improvements and affordable housing initiatives for downtown centers of the region, would total $75 billion over the next 24 years.
But even officials who support many specifics of the plan, like the need to create a more interconnected regional transit system, for instance, distanced themselves from the report's harshly insistent arguments about what will happen if those things are not fixed.
Louis R. Tomson, deputy secretary to Gov. George E. Pataki, said that the Governor heartily supported some of the plan's infrastructure ideas but that the overall tone of the study would certainly not be finding its way into the next series of "I Love New York" promotional brochures. "We don't share their view, and we clearly are not going to use their view to help attract people to the New York region," Mr. Tomson said. "We're basing our actions on optimism."
But if the selling is harder, the tactics promise to be different. Officials of the Regional Plan Association went on television on Wednesday night for an hour of public television in all three states, laying out the group's views in a program called "Region at Risk." An on-line chat in cyberspace was also scheduled with one of the plan's co-authors, Robert D. Yaro, on America Online.
The association is also openly pinning many of its hopes on Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who has been, they say, by far the most vocal and aggressive leader in the region in pushing for a new view of regional planning and cooperation.
"I'm not sure the average person understands what the Regional Plan Association is about, but they understand the message," said a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, Robert Friant. "I think people are worrying, 'How am I going to get to work, am I going to get stuck in traffic, and am I going to have a job?' Those are important questions and they resonate."

HEADLINE: Drug Makers Raised Prices For Retailers 4.6% in 1995

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Manufacturers' prices of the 500 most widely used prescription drugs rose 4.6 percent last year, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, a trade group, said yesterday.
The association said the increase compared with 4.1 percent in 1994 and 4 percent in 1993. The chain druggists said pharmacies paid $41.6 billion for the 500 drugs last year, which was 85 percent of the cost of all prescription drugs purchased by the stores. 
 Prescription drug price inflation slowed in 1993 as drug manufacturers moderated price increases after they became an issue in the 1992 Presidential campaign and the ensuing Washington health policy debate.
In another survey, by the Labor Department, manufacturers' prices for drugs rose 4.2 percent in December from a year earlier. That same month, the Producer Price Index of all finished goods rose 3 percent from a year earlier. In contrast, retail drug prices rose only 2 percent over December 1994, while the overall Consumer Price Index was up 2.2 percent.
Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a University of Minnesota researcher who directed the price survey for the chain drugstores, noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers included "everybody else the manufacturers give discounts to: hospitals, health maintenance organizations and government agencies."
But Ronald L. Ziegler, president of the drugstore association, said the gap between the Producer and Consumer Price Indexes reflected a squeeze on pharmacies, which were forced to swallow part of the increase.
In several lawsuits in Federal District Court in Chicago, thousands of pharmacies contend that the manufacturers have unfairly refused to offer them discounts that are available to many managed-care buyers.
Last week, 15 drug manufacturers agreed to settle a class action related to the discounts for about $408 million in cash and products. The companies said they had not acted improperly. The drug chains and at least one big group of pharmacies rejected the proposed settlement and are maintaining their lawsuits.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, a drug makers trade group, said yesterday that there had been only "modest inflation at the producer price level" last year. The manufacturers group cited a different measure of prices, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics officials said had been superseded by a pharmaceutical industry index in the 1980's. According to the earlier measure, called the wholesale price index, which the bureau said it still kept for "historical reasons," manufacturers' prices rose 3.7 percent in 1995, up from 3.1 percent in 1994, while prices of all manufactured goods increased by 2.2 percent in 1995.

HEADLINE: Fraud Figure's Actions Dim Recovery by Investors

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Three years ago, Steven Hoffenberg stepped into the spotlight by proposing to rescue a failing New York City tabloid with money from his Towers Financial Corporation, which turned out to be a Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of $450 million.
This week, awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to criminal fraud charges in the Towers case, Mr. Hoffenberg was in Little Rock, Ark., preparing to sue a key figure in the Whitewater scandal and telling associates he planned to run for the United States Senate -- after he somehow withdraws his guilty plea, is acquitted at some future trial and pays off his big debts. 
 From the first, everything about Mr. Hoffenberg has been over the top, as those who recall his brief career as acting publisher of The New York Post can attest. But his behavior in recent weeks -- from his Whitewater activities to his staging of a phony Federal Bureau of Investigation raid at a Long Island business -- has seemed so bizarre that Federal prosecutors have tried to get his bail revoked to insure that he will show up for sentencing for his crimes next month.
"Mr. Hoffenberg is in a very erratic state, and -- in the vernacular -- really seems about to boil over," said David Lewis, assistant United States attorney, at a bail hearing on Tuesday afternoon before Judge Robert W. Sweet in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Judge Sweet then volunteered that Mr. Hoffenberg had "visited our chambers" on Feb. 9, before leaving for Arkansas with the court's permission. "Fortunately, I was not present," Judge Sweet said, "but it was such an interchange that there may be some substance to what you say."
This unraveling of Mr. Hoffenberg's personal life would border on farce if it did not affect the thousands of investors who are still owed hundreds of millions of dollars from the Towers debacle. Their chances of recovering even a fraction of their money were slim, in any case, since Mr. Hoffenberg spent so lavishly while the Ponzi scheme was in full sail. But without Mr. Hoffenberg's rational help in tracking any missing assets, their odds diminish even further.
Amy Millard, an assistant United States attorney, told Judge Sweet on Jan. 31 that Mr. Hoffenberg still owed the Securities and Exchange Commission "many millions of dollars" under a civil settlement the commission obtained in the Towers case in November 1994. "He has made no payments to date, and yet he is expending large sums of money," Ms. Millard said.
Besides promising to pay $60 million to the S.E.C., $37 million of which was to help compensate investors, Mr. Hoffenberg also owes $516 million under a second settlement reached in November 1994 with the creditors of Towers Financial. While no one asserted at the time that he had anything like that much money, he did agree under that settlement to assist the bankruptcy trustee in tracking down any assets that might help satisfy that judgment.
But he has not provided that assistance, the Federal prosecutors have noted in court, and his own finances remain a mystery -- one that, in their view, raises the risk that Mr. Hoffenberg will flee before being sentenced.
At a hearing on Feb. 8, Michael Sommer, an assistant United States attorney, asked that bail be revoked, citing the "extreme amount of money involved in the underlying crime and the potential for flight capital being out there."
Judge Sweet declined and gave the financier until 5 o'clock last night to meet new bail terms. He also issued a bench warrant that would allow the Government to arrest Mr. Hoffenberg if he did not comply by the deadline.
As of 5 o'clock last night, no arrest had been made. Instead, the Government sent a letter to Judge Sweet explaining that Mr. Hoffenberg had offered some securities of uncertain value to meet the property requirements of the bond.
The Government was still evaluating those securities, the letter said, and would advise the court today of whether they were acceptable. In any case, the letter continued, no arrest would be made until after noon today.
Jeffrey Hoffman, Mr. Hoffenberg's lawyer, has repeatedly assured Judge Sweet that his client, while angry and "vociferous," is not a threat to others and has kept every required court date.
Mr. Hoffenberg, in a collect call from Arkansas last night, denied that he had behaved erratically. He said he would comply fully with any order by Judge Sweet, but referred questions about his case to Mr. Hoffman. "I can only talk to you about Whitewater," he said.
His Whitewater activities initially involved setting up a legal defense fund to aid James B. McDougal, the former business partner of President and Mrs. Clinton. In addition, he and Mr. McDougal entered into a deal to share the "economic opportunities" presented by Mr. McDougal's celebrity, such as movie deals or T-shirt sales.
But Mr. Hoffenberg said last night that he was now planning to sue Mr. McDougal over the terms of the deal. Mr. McDougal could not be reached for comment, but Mr. Lewis, the assistant United States attorney, told Judge Sweet on Tuesday that the Whitewater defendant's lawyers had called him "indicating that Mr. McDougal wants Mr. Hoffenberg to leave him alone."
After becoming involved with Mr. McDougal, Mr. Hoffenberg began to tell associates and journalists that he planned to run for the United States Senate seat now held by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who is leading the Senate's Whitewater investigation.
And even before that, Mr. Hoffenberg quarreled bitterly with Mary Hasho, the woman who bore his child -- and who had pledged her home as part of his bail when he was first arrested two years ago. It was Ms. Hasho's recent demand to be removed from his bail arrangements that first brought Federal prosecutors to court to seek new bail terms.
But at those hearings, Federal prosecutors have outlined other acts by Mr. Hoffenberg that they say have caused them alarm.
Ms. Millard described an incident in which Mr. Hoffenberg was said to have tried to intimidate Ms. Hasho's brother by going to his office "with another individual." Then, she said, Mr. Hoffenberg "told him that the other individual was with the F.B.I., that he had 20 more F.B.I. agents around the corner."
According to Ms. Millard, Mr. Hoffenberg has also tried to drum up new business with brochures that include pages from the fraudulent financial statements created for Towers Financial -- statements that she said were a component of the very fraud for which he was awaiting sentencing. Moreover, she said, he has portrayed himself repeatedly as a "Government witness" who can help disbarred stockbrokers regain their licenses to do business.
Asked how he was supporting himself, Mr. Hoffenberg said in an interview last week that he was "a business broker," who had "bought collection agencies for other people." He has an office in Great Neck under the name of Acquisition Associates.
That is the latest of a series of businesses he has started since Towers collapsed in early 1993. In mid-1993, after losing his bid for The Post because of an asset freeze imposed at the S.E.C.'s request, he started a newspaper called Her New York, aimed at a female urban audience; it collapsed a few months later with complaints that staff members had not been paid.
He also became involved with a new bill collection agency, the Diversified Credit Corporation, in violation of the terms of his original plea bargain with Federal prosecutors. That company also collapsed.

HEADLINE: Columbia Loses Harassment Suit

 BODY:
A Federal jury in Manhattan found on Tuesday that Columbia University failed to properly investigate a former employee's sexual harassment complaint against her supervisor, and so must pay her $450,000.
The trial followed a 1994 decision on the case by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which said that even though the employee, Sharon Karibian, who worked in the university's fund-raising office, had not suffered any economic loss because of the reported harassment, she was entitled to sue. The focus of such a case, it said, should be on the behavior of the accused harasser. 
 The appeals court said that an employer could be held liable for the behavior of employees who use their supervisory roles to demand sexual favors of lower-ranked personnel.
But the jury did not find that Mr. Urban had sexually harassed Ms. Karibian. Fred Knubel, a Columbia spokesman, said that "there is no basis for a verdict awarding damages against Columbia."
Judge Thomas P. Griesa said in court that he was puzzled by the verdict. The university has asked him to set it aside.
 Ms. Karibian said that her supervisor, Mark Urban, had threatened to cut her hours if she did not have a sexual relationship with him. Indeed, Mr. Urban gave Ms. Karibian pay raises and promotions, which she said were conditional upon a continuing sexual relationship.
 Ms. Karibian went to university committees numerous times to complain about Mr. Urban. "The jury found that Colombia has a duty to investigate these complaints, and by its failure to do so, implicitly condoned the behavior," said Elizabeth L. Coob, Ms. Karibian's lawyer.

HEADLINE: Sudan, Denying Terrorism Role, Vows to Resist World Pressure

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Top Sudanese officials, facing increasing international pressure for allowing terrorist groups to operate in the country, are making an attempt to cooperate with Security Council demands on one hand while threatening retaliation on the other.
The Security Council wants the Sudan to surrender three Egyptians suspected of involvement in the attempt to assassinate Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, last June in Ethiopia.
Sudanese officials have said repeatedly that they do not believe the suspects are in the Sudan. Nevertheless, the Interior Ministry has ordered all Egyptians to register with the police, and arrest warrants issued by the country's Prosecutor General are being read repeatedly on state radio and television.
Officials here warn that the country's Islamic military Government might lash back in the event of sanctions, although the United Nations is far from imposing any sanctions.
In this country, where the lead-in to the television evening news often includes images of lightning striking the Statue of Liberty, anti-American sentiments are common among officials.
"If people push us into a corner, we're going to fight back," Dr. Ghazi Atabari, the Secretary General of the National Congress, said in an interview. "Any means that is available to us, we'll use it."
Mahdi Ibrahim, the country's representative-designate to the United States, said in a separate conversation: "If action is taken against Sudan, it is baseless, it is a gross departure from the norms of justice, and it will only affect the people."
The United States has withdrawn its diplomats from Khartoum because, it says, the Government provides sanctuary for the Islamic Group, which claimed responsibility for the attack on Mr. Mubarak, as well as for other violent Muslim militant organizations.
Hassan al-Turabi, the leader of the National Islamic Front and perhaps the country's most influential political force, dismissed as "foolish" the American contention that the Sudan supports violent terrorist groups, and he said those beliefs fuel anti-American propaganda.
"You know human beings," he said. "Evil has to be adapted into somebody or something. "Now in Sudan, America has come to play that role."
Representatives of the Organization for African Unity and the United Nations are now in the Sudan for talks on the issue, and the Security Council has given Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali until March 31 to report on whether the Sudan has cooperated in surrendering the suspects to Ethiopia.
In what it has portrayed as a sign of its earnestness, the Sudan in recent days has asked Ethiopia to provide further information to help in tracking down the suspects. Ethiopia, already at odds with the Sudan, has challenged its sincerity.
"Since Sudan knows full well where the three gunmen are being sheltered and protected by its own security personnel, the notice issued by its prosecutor is the latest confirmation Sudan is not about to comply with the request of the Security Council," Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
Saddiq al-Mahdi, the Prime Minister who was overthrown in a 1989 coup here by Lieut. Gen. Omar Hassan Bashir, said the steps taken by the United States and the United Nations indicate the deterioration in relations between the Sudan and the rest of the world.
"The regime has come to the end of its tether," Mr. Mahdi said in an hourlong conversation in his home. "How long it can remain there, I don't know."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Belichick Isn't Moving to Baltimore

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH 

 BODY:
In what could be his final break with Cleveland, Art Modell dismissed Coach Bill Belichick yesterday, saying that the team's relocation to Baltimore offered "a new beginning, a fresh start."
"We've had some success with Bill, including an 11-5 playoff team in 1994," Modell said in a statement. "However, I believe to get to the next level, a change at head coach is necessary. I've said this before, I have great respect for the effort Bill puts into his coaching and preparation." 
 Modell wants to hire a new coach as quickly as possible. One candidate is Ted Marchibroda, who was fired by the Indianapolis Colts last Friday and who coached the Baltimore Colts from 1975-79. Don Shula turned down Modell's offer to come out of retirement.
Belichack was at his office yesterday at the Browns' complex in Berea, Ohio, after his dismissal.
"I appreciate the opportunity to coach the Cleveland Browns for the last five years," Belichick said in a statement. "I will always cherish the many memories of being part of the rich tradition and history of the Cleveland Browns. This team has an excellent future and I wish them well."
Belichick, who was 37-45 from 1991-95 and had just one winning season (11-5 and a wi'd-card berth in 1994), won't be unemployed for long. Both New England Coach Bill Parcells, who worked with Belichick with the Giants, and Miami Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson are interested in Belichick to become their defensive coordinator.
The Browns got off to a fast 3-1 start in 1995, but things turned sour after Modell announced his intentions to move the team out of Cleveland. Belichick benched quarterback Vinny Testaverde for three games during the middle of the season in favor of the rookie Eric Zeier in an effort to spark the team. It didn't work. The Browns, 4-4 at the time of the announcement, dropped seven of their last eight games and finished 5-11.
Belichick's tenure with the Browns will forever be linked with his decision to bench Bernie Kosar, a Cleveland-area native and local favorite, for Testaverde in 1993. The fans began calling for his head after the Browns finished with back-to-back 7-9 seasons, 1992 and '93.
Modell responded to the criticism by giving Belichick a vote of confidence and a two-year contract extension. Somewhere between last year's playoff appearance and the move to Baltimore, Modell reconsidered his confidence in the 43-year-old coach.
Belichick got his coaching start in 1975 as a 23-year-old special assistant coach -- a gofer, more or less -- in Baltimore with Marchibroda. "He was a young man who was willing to work round the clock for nothing and learned everything he could about the game," Marchibroda has said.
 
 
 
Steelers Say Jets Tampered
 The Pittsburgh Steelers filed a formal complaint with the National Football League this week, charging the Jets with tampering with quarterback Neil O'Donnell. The charge stems from comments that Jets Coach Rich Kotite made about O'Donnell, a potential free agent, during a news conference last week to announce the hiring of the former Steeler offensive coordinatop Ron Erhardt.
Kotite was asked whether Erhardt's close relationship with O'Donnell might influence the quarterback to sign with the Jets as a free agent. Kotite's detailed response struck Tom Donahoe, the Steelers' director of football operations, as inappropriate.
Donahoe filed a similar tampering complaint against Carolina last year, regarding the Panthers' contact with the Steeler defensive coordinator Dom Capers. Later, Capers became the Panthers' head coach. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed with the Steelers and the Panthers were fined $150,000 and lost second- and sixth-round picks in the 1995 draft.
 
 
 
Falcons' George a Team Player
 Jeff George said he wants to remain with Atlanta and is willing to take less money if it would help the Falcons keep other top free agents.
George and his agent, Leigh Steinberg, met with the team president, Taylor Smith, the vice president for personnel, Ken Herock, and Coach June Jones yesterday in Suwanee, Ga., in an effort to work out a deal.
"If it takes me taking less money to re-sign Bob Whitfield, Roman Fortin or Terance Mathis, I know what it takes to keep a team," George said. "Losing guys is not healthy for the team, and I want to do what is best for the Falcons." (AP)

HEADLINE: Washington's Mayor Wants to Cut City's Work Force by 25%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. today offered his vision of the future for the nation's capital, an ambitious plan to reduce the size of the city work force by 25 percent and to privatize some operations that have contributed to the city's financial crisis.
In disclosing ideas to make the District more "competitive, business-friendly, user-friendly and people-oriented," Mr. Barry used some of his harshest language ever to condemn the way the government runs and to criticize employees whose skills and manners have undermined public confidence in and respect for government. 
 "Here in Washington, D.C., this government transformation comes none too soon," Mr. Barry said after distributing a 120-page report that outlines his strategies. "Too many services are being performed badly. Many have been discontinued. Far too much of our equipment is antiquated and is in sorry shape. Our management and financial systems are old-fashioned and out of step. The lines for service are too long."
He added, "The D.C. government as measured by any reasonable expectation of the residents comes up short and is headed in the wrong direction."
Symbolically, the plan is a major political shift for Mr. Barry, who has been Washington's Mayor for all but four of the last 18 years. His broad-based popularity has been built on creating jobs in the city government.
But as the employment rolls grew through the flush 1980's, so did the seeds of fiscal undoing in the 1990's. And neither Sharon Pratt Kelly, who was Mayor from 1990 to 1994, nor Mr. Barry, who won re-election after a six-month term in prison for using cocaine, took steps to reverse the pattern.
Now, with the city strained by a $378 million deficit and a law requiring the budget to be balanced by 1999, Mr. Barry said that within four years the government would reduce its work force to 30,000 from the 40,000 on the books last November.
The Mayor did not say when workers might be dismissed or how much the transformation process would cost. He promised those details on Friday, when he plans to discuss the budget for the 1997 fiscal year.
Under the plan, as many as 16 agencies would be combined into 6 under the Mayor's direct authority. Also, Mr. Barry proposed that the District prison system be privatized and that the Lorton Federal Prison, which the city runs, be shut down.
Mr. Barry did not second-guess his own management practices.
"It was right for the times," he said of his policies of the 1980's.
Mr. Barry said the people involved in developing the new plan, including local elected officials, business leaders and management consultants, started with the concept that no government existed. The model they developed characterized residents and visitors as "customers" and placed government functions in six "retail" categories that directly serve the public, like police and schools, and four "wholesale" categories, like legal services and financial management, that serve the government.
Mr. Barry stressed that no changes could proceed without support and approval from, for example,the City Council, the Control Board and Congress, which has the ultimate authority over all District operations.
Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the District Operations Subcommittee, said that he was "encouraged by what the Mayor had to say" but that he would not comment further until he knew more details.
The Control Board said it would not comment until after the budget is released on Friday.

HEADLINE: East's Coal Towns Wither In the Name of Cleaner Air

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: FAIRMONT, W.Va, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Charles Riley weaves his pickup through snow-coated hills spotted with the small farms and scattered homes of his fellow coal miners. He points to the mountainous gob heap of castaway shale and rock, to the tall concrete portals in the flanks of hills, to the five-story superstructure of the new, 320-foot elevator shaft.
Far beneath these roads lies the dank and eerie subterranean city that is the Tygart River Mine. The state of the art in coal mining, it spreads over more than 20 square miles with a grid of numbered streets and avenues, trolley tracks, pipes to drain off the sulfur- and acid-laced water and cables for running machines and computers. 
 "Last summer, management said there was another 15 or 20 years of coal in here," said Mr. Riley, 49, a son and grandson of miners, a high school graduate who put his three children through four years of college. "Everyone went and bought new homes, new cars. I bought a new Jeep Cherokee."
But the Peabody Holding Company, the nation's largest coal producer, shut down the Tygart River Mine and dismissed all 368 workers last December, making it one of hundreds of mines to close in a landscape altered by a single provision of the Clean Air Act of 1990. Tygart was the biggest operation in once-mine-pocked Marion County, and its closing leaves just one large mine open in Marion. Adjacent Monongalia County lost two of its five major mines last year, and a third that employs 500 miners is to close this year.
Conditions across most of the Eastern coal country are the bleakest since the Great Depression, largely because the coal here is too high in sulfur to easily meet the clean air requirements. Mines are thriving in the West and in eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia, all producers of low-sulfur coal. But they are closing through most of Appalachia and in other coal-mining areas east of the Mississippi, and their loss is leaving huge gaps in the surrounding communities. It is the anguished human face of policies that even miners acknowledge have purified the air they breathe and the streams they fish in.
Since 1990, according to the National Coal Association, nearly 1,000 coal mines have closed in the United States, nearly all east of the Mississippi, leaving 2,500. The United Mine Workers of America says coal mine employment in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, western Kentucky and northern West Virginia has plunged more than 30 percent since the start of the decade, to 25,906 workers, about half because of automation. In the highly automated, surface-mined states of Colorado and Wyoming, employment has grown about 2 percent, to 5,514.
The mines in the high-sulfur areas are shutting because when the coal they yield is burned, the sulfur produces sulfur dioxide, a cause of acid rain. Under the Clean Air Act, power plants were required to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by half as of January 1995, and they must cut them further by 2000.
Utilities can install scrubbers to filter their smoke, but the scrubbers cost $100 million or more, so few have. Often at less cost, they can meet the air standards by blending high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal from Wyoming and Montana or from eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia.
Either way, the Clean Air Act has cut demand for high-sulfur coal and driven down prices to a point where many mine operators say they cannot make profits.
"Because of market conditions and the Clean Air Act, it was a marginal situation to begin with," said Garry Groves, a spokesman for the Eastern Associated Coal Corporation, the Peabody subsidiary that operated the Tygart River Mine.
Then, in August, a roof caved in. Only one worker was injured, losing a finger. But preventing future damage was too costly in view of the low price of the coal. "That was the last straw," Mr. Groves said. Peabody is now turning more to low-sulfur Western mines.
Nationwide, coal production is headed for a record 1.05 billion tons, said John Grasser, a spokesman for the National Coal Association. In the 1990's production in the long-dominant East will have fallen 14 percent by the end of this year, to 542 million tons annually, while in the West it will have jumped 26 percent, to 504 million tons. "It's directly related to the low-sulfur coal out there," Mr. Grasser said.
With the shutdown here in north-central West Virginia, Peabody drove a spike through the heart of an economy whose gentry -- with cars bought for cash, backyard swimming pools, wives who stayed home -- consisted of the $50,000-a-year men who dug the coal.
What hurts the miners hurts the local economy in proportions far exceeding the effect of other jobs. In 1994, before the Tygart River Mine closed, Marion County's 1,342 coal miners made up 7 percent of the workers and collected 16 percent of the wages paid in the county. Companies that equip mines and service their gear, also high wage payers, are folding as fast as the mines.
Jobs in mining, manufacturing and construction energize an economy more than others. Economists call them primary jobs because they beget secondary jobs that cater to the primary employers and their workers. "They have a lot to do with driving a local economy," said Stephen Shackelford, an economist in the West Virginia Bureau of Employment Programs.
With the loss of the mines and of several factories as well, he said, Marion County has lost nearly 400 retail jobs in the first half of the 1990's and 27 of its 355 stores. A study done for the Marion County Chamber of Commerce says county residents are spending $90 million more a year outside the county than in it.
"It hurts," said Charles Reese, president of the Marion County Chamber of Commerce. Along with the loss of mines, the county, with a population of 58,000, is littered with the corpses of departed manufacturing companies, like Owens-Illinois, a glass company, and Sharon Steel.
Mr. Reese said the county's 9 percent unemployment rate, compared with the national rate of 5.6 percent, was actually higher because many workers had stopped looking for jobs and were not counted.
"Things are not balancing out," he said. "We are getting some high-technology jobs where the skills are high but the wages are low. I think sometimes we should yell and scream more. It's just not our style."
Miners tend to be among the brightest of the community's high school students because the wages for the jobs have given mine operators the pick of the lot. The average miner here today is in his late 40's.
Like Charles Riley, Michael Chefren, 50, went no further than high school but has put three children through college and into careers far removed from mining. He started at the Tygart River Mine 21 years ago, about a year after it opened, and became a surface maintenance supervisor earning $55,000 a year. The money enabled him to buy a 45-acre farm. His wife, Jean, does not work.
"Everything we own is paid for," he said. "No mortgage. If I buy it, I pay for it. The last thing I financed was a car, in 1985." He has savings, is taking federally financed courses and is thinking of starting a business.
Even if he could, he is not certain he would return to the mine. "I feel pretty good not getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning and putting in 12 and 14 hours a day," he said.
Rich Eddy of Fairmont, president of District 31 of the United Mine Workers of America, who oversees members in 31 of the state's 55 counties, says he is still skeptical that high-sulfur coal contributes to acid rain. But many miners welcome the changes that environmental regulation has brought.
"All of us grew up in coal camps and lived within walking distance of the mines," said Gary Pastorial, 46, who was laid off from Tygart. "Everyone burned coal in their homes, and when you went out in the evening, you couldn't see the air. One of my chores was to scrub the front porch with a mop every day because it was black."
Today Mr. Pastorial lives in a spotless ranch house he just built in an upper-income subdivision, and he looks upon a horizon of pristine air. "The West Fork River was dead," he said. "Now people fish in it."
Congress is helping to soften the blow of layoffs attributed to the Clean Air Act. Like most people who lose their jobs, the miners receive unemployment compensation for six months. But the Government also pays for them to go to school for up to two years to learn new skills and keeps paying them their unemployment benefit, typically $290 a week, for the duration.
But no training is likely to yield jobs like the ones these men have lost. Many are taking courses in the construction trades, which pay a little more than a third of the $17 an hour they typically earned in the mines. But a state analysis of the county economy says that in 1994 and 1995, there were 456 applicants for 21 construction jobs.
"If they don't go to school, they're going to be lucky to get $5 an hour," said Cathy Tarley, manager of Marion County office of the state job service. "If they do go to school for two years, they might get $8 to $10."
Most new jobs are in health care and in Government offices requiring clerical skills. "We're trying to get wives in for training," Mrs. Tarley said. "A lot of the jobs that are being created are more suitable for females."
John Beveridge spent 22 years in the mines, the last 13 at the Peabody mine. He is a roof bolter, a highly skilled worker who bores six-foot-long rods into the roofs of mines to keep them from falling. It is treacherous work; the driller must learn to read sounds and vibrations to know when a roof might crash. Mr. Beveridge said his worst injury was a broken leg.
As a youth, he completed three years of college, majoring in psychology. He also boxed professionally for 15 years as a hobby. But nothing paid like mining. "You could work seven days a week if you wanted to," Mr. Beveridge said. He made $48,000 last year in the mine before he was let go in early October.
"I'm scared to death," he said. "I'm 44 years old. I'd like to live another 50 years. What am I going to do?"

HEADLINE: POLITICS: ON THE MOVE;
Fueled by Success, Buchanan Revels in Rapid-Fire Oratory

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 14

 BODY:
It was a blue-collar, red-meat moment in Patrick J. Buchanan's lyrically combative stump speech, and the crowd cheered each scrap as he spoke as the Republican Presidential candidate most eager to disparage Big Business.
"Look what's going on in our country, my friends," declared Mr. Buchanan, his voice energized by his surprising second-place perch in the Iowa caucuses and his promising chances here. "When AT&T lops off 40,000 jobs, the executioner that does it, he's a big hero on the cover of one of these magazines, and AT&T stock soars." 
 The candidate's perfect pitch of grievance and outrage keyed the partisan crowd to a din of sympathetic shouts and applause as he spoke for those 40,000, not the stockholders: "We've got to have a new conservatism of the heart that looks upon all Americans as brothers and sisters. We've got to be concerned about all of our folks."
The crowd packed into a restaurant banquet hall on Tuesday night alternated between booming approval and sharp attention as Mr. Buchanan, a politician near the top of his orating game, tore into "this idea of these new businesses, these cold-blooded characters with the green eyeshades."
"Yes!" shouted a listener in encouragement as Mr. Buchanan, his voice hoarse, his eyes merry with combat, roared onward: "That's not what conservatism is all about. That's arid, desiccated conservatism."
More cheers prompted a great grin from the candidate. As he was drenched in a chorus of "Go, Pat, go!" Mr. Buchanan cut off his followers with the cry of, "Let me tell you: Pat is going!"
Emboldened by what he terms a chain-lightning strategy of voter poll victories in Alaska and Louisiana and a finish within three points of Senator Bob Dole's Iowa victory, Mr. Buchanan has retooled his 1992 campaign speech into a kinetic, angry, optimistic sermon on "the new conservatism of the heart." Onto his moralizing base of anti-abortion social conservatism, he has grafted a sharp strain of economic populism, and the hybrid is proving attractive.
"A new conservatism of the heart that looks out for the right to life and the innocence of the unborn," Mr. Buchanan declaims. "A conservatism that speaks up for the working-class Americans who are betrayed by these trade deals that send their jobs over to Mexico, a new conservatism that's going to lift that burden of taxation and that burden of economic insecurity off the middle class. It's going to lift that burden of regulation and taxation off the small businesses that are the backbone of this country, that are creating the jobs when the big businesses are shutting them down."
Large audiences here and in Iowa across the last week have been delighting in his words, even as Dole strategists and other Establishment Republicans fret that the shadow of Mr. Buchanan as a kind of Beltway Huey Long will once more be cast across the party all the way to November. The best proof of his inroads is the fact that Mr. Dole has been hurriedly adapting his own stump speech with Buchanan-like jeremiads about cultural degradation and working-class despair.
"Change polls, change hearts, change minds, move forward," Mr. Buchanan intones, urging the upset of Senator Dole. "Accept your defeats. Get up. Go forward."
Bluff, affable and ever strategic, Mr. Buchanan mocks the distress of party warhorses as he seeks a coalition of the politically disaffected and displays his stump power as a polemicist. With his success thus far, Mr. Buchanan's talent for shrapnel-packed rhetoric has been easing into something more benign, even gracious at times. His ability to make a large crowd guffaw has rarely been as acute.
"Let me introduce to you the lady beside me last night who I finally decided I intend to nominate to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton," he says, always getting a laugh as he introduces his wife, Shelly, by taking double-barreled aim at the President's morals and the First Lady's talent for controversy.
Mr. Buchanan revels in skewering President Clinton's own instinct for political survival in having recently adapted to such conservative positions as praying in schools and renouncing Big Government. "Next week he'll be up here with the gun owners of New Hampshire," he says of the President, "holding an assault weapon over his head, wearing one of those camouflage outfits, saying, 'Don't try to take mah fah-arms away from me.' "
As the crowd fairly leers with pleasure, Mr. Buchanan adds, "This guy is shameless." Mr. Buchanan focuses more fire on the Republican front-runner, Mr. Dole, and is dismissive of other contenders like "Junior Forbes" and Lamar Alexander. "Look," he says of Mr. Alexander, "I've been a conservative for 25 years. He can't make up for that by walking across the state in a plaid shirt."
The candidate proudly tells of his political roots all the way back to the service of Richard M. Nixon's pre-White House strategy of 1966. "I was in training for break-ins at the time," says Mr. Buchanan, using a joke to get to the political crux learned from Mr. Nixon. "We talked together about Roosevelt's New Deal coalition, about how we could pull apart pieces of it and put together a new majority coalition."
Deadly serious, the candidate exhorts his audience to sweep New Hampshire byways for Reagan Democrats and Perot dissidents: "That's what we're building. This is an open movement."
Whether Mr. Buchanan can do more than roil the party's presumed center once more remains an open question until Tuesday, at least. Supporters prize his outspokenness but tend not to delve into any larger economic risks implied in his protectionist speechifying in behalf of worker-voters.
"Buchanan is the only man who will address the issue of the proliferation of gay legislation and say what he believes," said Dick Hugg, a farmer who heard Mr. Buchanan address the Knights of Columbus Saturday morning in Carroll, Iowa. There, the candidate, a Roman Catholic, twinned his main themes, moving from the "evil empire" of abortion to the papal encyclical, "Rerum Novarum," which a century ago stressed the moral right of workers to a living wage.
In the current shifting field, Mr. Buchanan appears to offer his signature anti-abortion position as a measure of political consistency as much as social conscience.
In the crowd's applause of the economic themes Tuesday night, Michael G. Biundo, a Buchanan voter from 1992, heard a difference. "This was more of a sprint in '92," said Mr. Biundo, now deputy director of the state campaign. "This time Pat senses it's only part of a larger mar

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ECONOMY;
Republicans and Democrats Jumping on the Issue of Corporate Responsibility

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts has always been considered a standard Republican fiscal conservative. But last month he gave his State of the State address a populist twist when he spoke of the "nagging fear" caused by corporate downsizing and lectured businesses that "you still have a responsibility for the good of the community in which you reside."
Far across the political spectrum, President Clinton's liberal Labor Secretary, Robert E. Reich, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts have called for using tax policy to encourage corporations to treat their workers better. Mr. Kennedy recently spoke of a "quiet Depression" and said government policies should provide "incentives for good corporate citizenship." 
 And now Senator Bob Dole, a traditional deficit-cutting Main Street Republican, has struck out against corporate greed, noting that "corporate profits are setting records and so are corporate layoffs" as he searches for a way to counter the economic nationalism of Patrick J. Buchanan.
Indeed, the call for corporate responsibility, which was barely a political whisper just months ago, has now become a theme of a crowded field of political figures.
The oratory does not necessarily lead Republicans and Democrats to the same places. Mr. Weld wants corporations to start hiring welfare recipients, while Mr. Reich suggests that corporate income taxes might be reduced or eliminated for companies that keep more employees on their payroll.
But major figures in both parties are being driven by the same concern about the political implications of a changing economy in which the gap between the well-to-do and the poor has been growing. The stock market hits new highs every day, yet median income is stagnant or falling.
President Clinton, for example, would love to take credit for the economic resurgence that has taken place since he took office. As he noted in his economic report to Congress today, the nation has nearly eight million new jobs, the budget deficit has nearly been halved, and the "misery index" that measures inflation and unemployment is at its lowest level in nearly three decades.
But in campaign speeches, he also acknowledges that "there is another side to America's economy: about half our people still haven't gotten a raise in terms of real purchasing power of their incomes in 10 or 15 years."
What has caught the eye of political strategists is that economic insecurity now afflicts two potentially volatile segments of the electorate: working-class Democrats who deserted their party in the Reagan years but then returned to Mr. Clinton in 1992 and a professional class of middle managers, among them Republicans and independents.
"An awful lot of Republicans have been losing jobs they thought would always be there in big corporations," said Kevin Phillips, a conservative political analyst.
In some ways, this could pose the greater challenge to the Republicans who have long held as central tenant the idea that "a rising tide lifts all boats" -- if businesses prosper, Americans prosper. But that axiom sounds less convincing when AT&T announces it is laying off 40,000 workers.
"What we've seen in the last 15 years is a whole Republican emphasis on markets and freeing up business and deregulation," Mr. Phillips said. "I think all of those trends have peaked and are in retreat and I think now even the Republicans are starting to understand that."
Other conservatives vehemently disagree. They find Mr. Buchanan's protectionist views abhorrent and say they believe that even Mr. Dole is treading on risky ground for a Republican when he points to high profits and stagnant wages.
"It plays into the hands of those who argue that there's something fundamentally wrong with the American economy, that there's market failure that government should come in and fix," said Stuart M. Butler of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Countries that are entrepreneurial and have a dynamic economy clearly perform better than those that try to freeze change and give complete security."
For Mr. Clinton, these themes are also troublesome. He campaigned in 1992 on a pledge to make life better for the middle class. And voters, when judging an incumbent President, ask whether they are better off than they were four years ago. Does he want to tell them that they are not?
Mr. Clinton's advisers are divided into two camps. His team of pollsters and consultants argue that corporate downsizing is an overblown issue -- that the number of jobs created recently far outstrips those lost -- and that he should rally voters with optimism.
But another set of "paycheck" Democrats around Mr. Clinton, including liberals in his Administration and members of his 1992 camapign team, would like to see more emphasis on pocketbook issues.
So far he has restricted himself to calls for more education and training programs, for a higher minimum wage and the endorsement of a bill in Congress that would make health care benefits more available to people who change jobs or have pre-existing illnesses.
How this political dialogue develops over the next few months may depend less on Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole than on Republicans and Democrats who are not as concerned with hewing to the political center.
Several Congressional Democrats, fearful of losing their party's base, are drawing up initiatives to encourage companies to consider the well-being of their workers as well as their stockholders. And both parties are carefully watching how far Mr. Buchanan gets. In fact, the Clinton Administration included a lengthy defense of free trade in its economic report today.
While not naming Mr. Buchanan, the report argued with his assumption that increased foreign trade with low-wage countries has undercut the earnings of American workers. In almost all industries, Mr. Clinton's report maintained, the employment of skilled workers has increased even though they cost more.

HEADLINE: A Prominent Chicago Family Changes Course

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
The decision by the Gidwitz family to sell control of Helene Curtis Industries to the British-Dutch giant Unilever P.L.C., announced today, is as likely to be avidly discussed in social and political circles here, as on the business circuit.
"Chicago had its fair share of founding families in the 19th century, but in the 20th there have been few so intimately identified with the city as the Gidwitzes," said James Thompson, a former Governor of Illinois who is now managing partner at Winston & Strawn, one of the city's most influential law firms. "They are right up there with people like the Pritzkers and the Crowns." 
 The family's leading civic light is Ronald J. Gidwitz, 50, who is not only president and chief executive of Helene Curtis but is also one of Mayor Richard Daley's closest friends in the business community. Mr. Gidwitz is also a leading figure in local and state Republican party politics and a prominent member of numerous civic, cultural and educational boards.
Those boards that Mr. Gidwitz does not belong to often tap the fund-raising skills and enthusiasm of his wife, Christina Gidwitz. She is the daughter of James Kemper, founder of the Kemper insurance empire, and was already prominent locally as a fashion model when the couple married in 1975. The couple have two sons, 11 and 8, and live in the fashionable Gold Coast district near Lake Michigan, where Mr. Gidwitz served as a Republican ward leader for several years.
The Gidwitz family's involvement in Helene Curtis dates to 1927, when Ronald's grandfather, Jacob Gidwitz, invested $5,000 in what was then a struggling manufacturer of mudpacks and facial masks. Today, about 75 percent of the voting stock of the company is controlled by the Gidwitz family.
The company said today that Mr. Gidwitz intended to stay on as chief executive, which raised hopes here that the sale would not mean an end anytime soon to the company's commitment to manufacturing on the city's impoverished West Side.
Those who know Mr. Gidwitz will be watching to see how well he fares within the legendary bureaucracy of Unilever. "I think he likes running a company, and the influence being a C.E.O. brings is important to him," said David Paulus, a former senior executive at First Chicago Bank who became Mr. Gidwitz's friend when the two worked on political campaigns and school reform efforts here during the 1980's.
Mr. Gidwitz's civic background may have given him some helpful training for the corporate politics ahead. He has been prominent in recent years in his job as head of the troubled City Colleges, leading a series of cutbacks, administrative changes and tough union negotiations that have made him the focus of blistering attacks by local labor and education groups. That job, like an earlier position reviving the city's Economic Development Committee, at times consumed as many as 30 hours a week.
"He's very gutsy," said Grace Berry, executive director of the Economic Club of Chicago. "He's really tried to be the change agent in some tough situations."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: BOWING OUT;
Big Budget, Early Start and the Candidate Are Figured in the Collapse of Gramm's Bid

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
He peaked too early.
A year ago, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas was assembling a campaign juggernaut. He declared for President before anyone else. He raised $4.1 million at a dinner in Dallas, one of the largest takes for a single campaign event in American political history. He spent a fortune winning dozens of straw polls, all nonbinding but all intended to bring an air of momentum and inevitability to Mr. Gramm's bid for the White House. 
 And while several big G.O.P. names like Kemp, Cheney, Quayle and Bennett skipped the race, bemoaning the logistical and gastrointestinal demands of the chicken-dinner circuit, Mr. Gramm said he just loved asking people for support.
But today, barely a week after voters started selecting actual delegates to the Republican convention, Mr. Gramm's $21.1 million offensive came to a screeching halt, in perhaps the most spectacular collapse of a Presidential campaign since Mr. Gramm's fellow Texan, John B. Connally, famously spent $12 million to capture one delegate to the 1980 Republican convention.
"When the voter speaks, I listen," Mr. Gramm said in Washington in withdrawing from the race today, two days after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, "especially when the voter is saying someone else's name." But the Senator said he was not endorsing anyone today.
What went wrong in the Gramm campaign? Interviews with voters, and with political operatives in and out of the Gramm camp, point to a number of strategic missteps and an overarching conclusion that the campaign's organizational and fund-raising muscle, especially when boasted about by the candidate himself, backfired with the voters.
The strategic problems include a major failure to anticipate the serious and ultimately successful one-on-one challenge in last week's Louisiana caucuses from Patrick J. Buchanan -- "a tactical blunder of enormous proportions," said Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Gramm's national chairman. Mr. Gramm also angered leading officials in Iowa and New Hampshire by backing other states' efforts to hold earlier primaries or caucuses.
And internal campaign memorandums suggest that even with ahuge budget for television commercials, Mr. Gramm had image problems with the voters.
"Thank God for the mute button," was one member of a New Hampshire focus group's response to an early spot featuring Mr. Gramm.
Of course, the most elemental conclusion remains that even when voters had ample opportunity to see Mr. Gramm's face and hear his voice, they did not cotton to the candidate.
The owlish, drawling Mr. Gramm delighted in telling audiences that his own wife's first reaction to him was "Yuck!" -- the real point being that in time, she came to discover his virtues and the American people would too. But voters spent far less time with him than Wendy Lee Gramm did.
"I don't think he could ever overcome the 'Yuck!' factor in this campaign," said Richard W. Murray, a political science professor and longtime Gramm observer at the University of Houston.
And another lesson of the Gramm campaign is that a huge financial war-chest will only bring a candidate so far, and can even amount to a turnoff. Mr. Gramm has probably lived to regret his eyebrow-raising remark to supporters at the glittering Dallas dinner: "Thanks to you, I have the most reliable friend you can have in American politics, and that's ready money."
The focus-group interviews, according to a September memo by a Gramm pollster named Linda DiVall, showed that a commercial trumpeting the Senator's successes to date actually made voters suspicious: "Iowa straw poll is meaningless," said one man, according to the memo. "It was bought."
Mr. Gramm said he would now concentrate on his re-election this fall. His negative ratings in Texas, however, are higher than either of the state's other leading Republicans -- Gov. George W. Bush and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison -- and several well-established Democrats are vying in a March primary for the right to challenge him in November.
Still, for the moment, Mr. Gramm and his top advisers are clearly assessing just what happened to the campaign. As his campaign manager in New Hampshire put it: "The strategy could have gone off like a rocket, but it was one of those things that didn't go. It didn't take off."
The basic strategy was to establish Mr. Gramm early on, in his words, as "the conservative alternative to Bob Dole." The fund raising helped to scare off some competitors and the straw polls were intended to show that Mr. Gramm was more viable than other candidates.
But he invested millions early on and in securing the victories in what were technically meaningless contests, Mr. Gramm ultimately seems to have set the bar needlessly high for expectations about his campaign. Rather than casting himself as an underdog and rising up, he declared himself the big dog early on and went downhill from there.
Even in Louisiana, where he could have portrayed the contest as a dogfight between himself and Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Gramm insisted up until the end that he would win and win huge; in losing, his campaign was all but finished, with no momentum going into Iowa.
In Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters and state leaders alike jealously guard their first-in-the-nation voting status on the road to the nomination, Mr. Gramm's decision to enter the Louisiana caucuses alienated some people. "I think Phil Gramm made a big mistake playing footsie with Louisiana," said Iowa's Governor, Terry E. Branstad.
Several top officials in Mr. Gramm's campaign argued today that many economic conservatives found Mr. Gramm appealing but still believed that it was Mr. Dole's turn for the Republican nomination, and that conservatives who were focused on social issues had been drawn to Mr. Buchanan.
"It's kind of a game where being a lot of people's second choice isn't enough," said Charles Black, Mr. Gramm's chief strategist. Speaking of religious conservatives in Louisiana and Iowa, he said: "In the end, they opted for the more fiery, passionate presentation of their views that Buchanan gives."
Still, Mr. Gramm's credentials with these conservatives may have been suspect all along; early on in the campaign, he was widely quoted as having said, in explaining that economic issues were paramount in his campaign, "I ain't running for preacher."
The post-mortems on his campaign will continue to address the issue of whether the real problem was the messenger or the message. While many Republicans said that Mr. Gramm was simply neither telegenic nor personally appealing to voters, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Christopher J. Dodd, wasted no time in arguing that the real failure in the campaign was that of the message.
"Phil, probably more than any candidate in this field, took the Gingrich new Congress program on the road," Mr. Dodd said today. "On the economic, conservative message of the Gingrich Congress and the Contract with America, it doesn't fly."
After losing Louisiana, aides said, Mr. Gramm fully realized that his campaign was probably doomed, but he decided to soldier on into Iowa, and he did so not without humor or panache.
At one point last weekend, just before getting off the bus in Davenport, he stood and thanked his workers and, apparently inspired by the company of Charlton Heston on the campaign trail, suddenly intoned a close approximation of Shakespearean dialogue, from the Battle of Agincourt, from "Henry V":
"Men abed in England will think themselves accursed they were not here with us," Senator Gramm said before hopping off the bus and plunging himself before the Iowans, "and hold their manhood cheap while any speak who fought with us on St. Crispin's day."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE PRIMARIES;
New England Finds G.O.P. Trying Out New Tactics

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 14

 BODY:
Searching for an edge in the tight primary race here, the Republican candidates for President tested new tactics today.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas concentrated on foreign policy for the first time in weeks, criticizing President Clinton's stands in Bosnia and Haiti and emphasizing his opponents' lack of experience in this area. 
 Energized by a strong second-place showing in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night, Patrick J. Buchanan leveled the most savage attack he had ever tried on Mr. Dole.
Steve Forbes, coming off a poor showing in Iowa and dropping in several opinion polls, declared that he had made a mistake in recent weeks by broadcasting so many advertisements criticizing his opponents. Today, he turned to a new set of commercials that emphasize his advocacy of a low, flat tax and other issues.
Lamar Alexander, still in fourth place in the polls but apparently gaining new strength, campaigned with his newest champion, William J. Bennett, the conservative Secretary of Education in the Reagan Administration. Mr. Alexander's emphasis today was on his proposal to overhaul the welfare system.
In Washington, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas officially withdrew from the Presidential race. "When the voter speaks," Mr. Gramm said at a news conference, "I listen, especially when the voter is saying someone else's name."
Mr. Dole called Mr. Gramm this morning, and the word in political circles was that Mr. Gramm would endorse him. But Mr. Gramm withheld making an endorsement today, although he made it clear that Mr. Buchanan would not win him over. "I believe that Pat Buchanan's stand on protectionism is at variance with our party's commitment," he said.
With Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former representative to the United Nations, at his side, Mr. Dole displayed his grasp of foreign policy issues. He said that had he been President he would have lifted the embargo on selling arms to Bosnia but would not have sent American troops. He also said the Clinton Administration was wrong to send money to Haiti to support the former President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The goal of Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader, was to draw attention to the fact that his rivals have had little experience dealing with such matters.
"My point is this," Mr. Dole, looking rested, told business leaders at a breakfast in Nashua, "I know foreign policy is rarely considered when you walk into the voting booth. You're worried about jobs and crime, education and the environment, Medicare, whatever, taxes. If a crisis occurs, maybe on the first days of someone's watch in 1997, or maybe the first week or the first month or the first six months, it's good to have somebody around the White House who's had some experience.
"It's not the place for on-the-job training," he declared.
Mr. Buchanan's first stop on Valentine's Day was at a company in Madbury that grows roses. He bought a dozen for his wife, Shelley, and used the occasion to reinforce his position in favor of trade restrictions. By lowering tariffs on South American flowers, he said, the United States is "killing one flower grower after another after another after another."
Then Mr. Buchanan went on the attack. He called Mr. Dole "the biggest taxer in the modern history of the Republican Party," "Mr. Nafta, Mr. Gatt and Mr. Mexican bailout" and "an Archer-Daniels-Midland Republican." The last snipe was a reference to the financial support Mr. Dole has received over the years from Dwayne O. Andreas, the chairman, and other executives at the giant agricultural conglomerate.
"Mr. Dole put the interest of the big banks -- Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Goldman Sachs -- ahead of the American people," Mr. Buchanan declared.
Mr. Forbes did not so much apologize for the pervasive negative commercials he has been broadcasting as indicate that he thought they had damaged his campaign.
Standing in the snow outside his bus in Milford, Mr. Forbes said: "Clearly, I spent too much time -- we spent too much time -- discussing the records of our opponents. I want to now concentrate on what I'm standing for, how I think America can have a chance to move ahead."
The Forbes campaign went on the air today with three new advertisements. In one, Mr. Forbes discusses on camera the economic benefits he believes the country will gain from his flat-tax proposal. In another, he advocates medical savings accounts. In a third, he calls for giving parents greater choices in schools for their children and Government vouchers to help parents pay for private schools.
Mr. Forbes even offered a new metaphor for the American tax system. He no longer called it "a playground for lawyers and lobbyists." Now, it is "a nauseating swamp of loopholes, a toxic cesspool."
The Alexander campaign said the former Tennessee Governor and Education Secretary would focus on a different issue each day this week. The issue du jour today was welfare, which meant that Mr. Alexander added a few paragraphs on the subject to his standard speech.
His position is that the main Federal welfare programs, Aid to Families With Dependent Children and food stamps, should be scrapped. Instead, he said, the money should be turned over to private charities and foundations in communities across the country to fulfill the functions now performed by Government agencies.

HEADLINE: With Prices Low, Gasoline Guzzling Makes a Comeback

 BODY:
More Americans are driving bigger cars and trucks longer distances -- and at faster speeds -- with scarcely a thought for mileage conservation or pollution.
With prices at the pump, when adjusted for inflation, at lows not seen since the 1950's, gasoline consumption is increasing. After declining slightly from 1989 through 1991, consumption rose by 1.1 percent in 1992, 1.4 percent in 1993 and 1.7 percent in 1994 before shooting up 2.5 percent last year, according to the American Petroleum Institute. And analysts expect the rise to continue. 
 With memories of the oil shocks of the 1970's fading, the oil cartel apparently broken and prices generally stable over the last decade, motorists have little incentive to conserve energy, analysts say. Indeed, the gas mileage of most of the popular sport utility vehicles and mini-vans is not much better than the monster gas guzzlers of old.
This fundamental shift in Americans' driving habits, however, is worrying environmentalists and strategic planners.
And some experts fear Americans are becoming complacent about the risk of becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil supplies.

HEADLINE: 4 NETWORKS PLAN A RATINGS SYSTEM FOR THEIR SHOWS

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
After years of resisting as censorship any attempt to regulate the content of television programs, the four broadcast networks are seeking to establish their own ratings system, similar to the Motion Picture Association of America's code for movies.
In meetings this week in New York and Los Angeles, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox have been discussing a system that would allow them to assuage growing public discontent over the violence and sexual content of some television programs and hold onto advertisers without jeopardizing the networks' longstanding argument that ratings constitute censorship. 
 The creation of the networks' own system is seen by many in the industry as an effort to seize the initiative and preempt any Government effort to establish content ratings, as permitted under a sweeping telecommunications bill that became law last week. Should the F.C.C. reject the industry's ratings as inadequate, a step that the law permits, the broadcasters would have firmer grounds for a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the new law, industry officials said.
But the networks have several other motives as well, people close to the talks this week said, including overwhelming pressure from the public and from politicians angered by the level of violence and sex on television and in films.
In addition, ABC and Fox have recently signaled that they favor a rating system for the networks. Fear that one or the other might create its own system and publicize it as "family-friendly" is putting pressure on NBC and CBS, several officials at the networks said. ABC, part of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., was recently acquired by the Walt Disney Company, a conglomerate whose success is built on its image as family entertainment.
Any rating system devised by the networks -- whether similar to that used for movies, or using a different code, or perhaps age classifications -- would eventually enable consumers to screen out certain programs by using an electronic blocking device known as a V-chip, with the "V" standing for "violence," industry officials said. The telecommunications act requires all new television sets to be equipped with the V-chip.
Objections to the amount of sex and violence on television and in the movies have come from all sides of the political spectrum, from President Clinton to Senator Bob Dole, the Republican majority leader; to William Bennett, the conservative former Education Secretary, to Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, the original champion of the V-chip.
President Clinton has invited the chief executives of the four broadcast networks and about a dozen cable-network executives to a meeting on Feb. 28 on the issue of television content. The broadcast network executives are hoping to reach a consensus on a ratings system before that meeting.
"Family values" and the entertainment industry's role in promoting or destroying them is a potent topic in this election year, as the network executives acknowledge.
At a closed annual meeting last week for top Capital Cities executives in Phoenix that was attended for the first time by Disney executives, Robert A. Iger, president of Capital Cities/ABC, told colleagues that the pressure for V-chip legislation reflected a wave of strong public opinion and that the company should find a way to allay that dissatisfaction, an industry executive said.
Fox's position in favor of a ratings system was less predictable, given that the network has often been criticized for broadcasting sexually explicit shows and that Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, which owns the network, has generally fought Government regulation of broadcasting.
But officials at rival networks who insisted on anonymity suggested that giving such shows a rating would in a sense defuse criticism of them, because parents would be alerted to the content and could program their V-chip to block shows they found objectionable.
The same point has been made to explain the cable industry's receptivity to an industry-devised ratings system. Although shows with coarse language, excessive violence or sexually suggestive scenes are more common on cable than on broadcast television, there are so many cable networks -- some of them known for such content -- that the industry as a whole is less averse to labeling.
The broadcast networks, on the other hand, rely on a broader audience than cable does. Their revenue comes from advertising, while cable revenue comes partly from subscriber fees and partly from advertising.
Broadcasters have traditionally opposed content ratings and any sort of V-chip mechanism not only because of First Amendment concerns but also out of fear that advertisers will abandon shows that have been rated as violent or racy. For example, advertisers shied away from "N.Y.P.D. Blue," the ABC police drama, which contains coarse language and some nudity, in its first year. But many flocked to the program after it began receiving high ratings.
When the telecommunications law was being drafted last year, the networks believed they could challenge it as unconstitutional if it required a ratings system. Instead, the law requires manufacturers to install V-chips on new sets and states that if the networks establish ratings, they must transmit them through the V-chip.
The law urges the networks to devise their own ratings system within one year and requires the F.C.C. to review it. If the networks do not establish a system or the F.C.C. rejects it, the law permits the F.C.C. to choose a panel and develop a ratings system for the networks.
Although the networks would not be required by law to apply that system, many in the industry believe that if the cable industry used it, or one of the four broadcast networks broke ranks and used it, public pressure would grow on the other networks to go along as well.
"It puts them in an awkward position, of having to justify why they aren't making this useful information available to parents," said one F.C.C. staff member, Blair Levin.
But if they developed their own system and the F.C.C. rejected it, the networks would then have stronger grounds for a First Amendment challenge than the teleCommunications legislation now provides, said one network lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Officials at all four networks said they expected a consensus to be reached on an industry-devised ratings system but would not predict when. One said he expected it to be drafted this week; another said it could come any time "between now and the President's summit."
Executives at advertising agencies who help marketers decide where to place television commercials generally applauded the idea of a network ratings system and said it would not have much of an economic effect, at least not initially.
They said their agencies were likely to continue to screen programs or use screening services if asked to do so by clients that are concerned about the content of the programs in which their spots appear.
Many advertisers have compiled guidelines for buying commercial time that cover content issues like sex and violence. Such guidelines might require that a company's commercials be withdrawn from programs with plots that touch on a specific issue like mistreatment of animals, abortion or child abuse.
Arnie Semsky, executive vice president and director for media and programming services at the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group in New York, said of the networks' effort: "It's a step in the right direction. A ratings service would be handy as an indicator, as a guide, but I think we would still screen every episode."
"It's just the networks' judgment," he added. "What a network says is an R or a PG can't take into effect all the client considerations that we can." As a result, Mr. Semsky said, he doubted whether there would be "any advertising falloff." 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 17, 1996, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about discussions by the four broadcast television networks on a rating system for the violence and sexual content of programs misstated the date of a meeting to which network chief executives had been invited by President Clinton. It is Feb. 29, not Feb. 28.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Volatile Day Sinks Prices Of U.S. Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Technical selling and a large supply of new corporate and global issues combined to drive Treasury prices lower in volatile trading yesterday.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 1 1/32 , to 97 25/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.16 percent, from 6.09 percent on Wednesday. On the short end of the market, the three-month bill rate was lower, at 4.76 percent, down 3 basis points, reflecting some movement from longer-term to shorter-term issues. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 The decline in the market came on the last full trading day before a three-day weekend. The market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Washington's Birthday holiday, and the Public Securities Association, which represents firms that buy and sell debt securities, has recommended an early close at 2 P.M. today, a recommendation that dealers usually follow.
While weak economic reports gave the market some support, they were not compelling enough to bring in buyers. Traders and analysts attributed part of the selling yesterday to new corporate and global issues that lured investors away from Treasury securities with their higher yields.
Argentina priced $1 billion in the global bond market yesterday, becoming the third government borrower to sell securities while rates in the United States are low and investor demand for higher returns is strong.
Argentina's five-year junk bonds were sold through Merrill Lynch and CS First Boston and were priced to yield 9.284 percent, or about 410 basis points more than a Treasury security with a similar maturity.
In another huge offering, Chase Securities led underwriters in a $1.474 billion sale of Chase Manhattan Bank auto loan asset-backed certificates with an average life of 1.592 years.
The triple-A rated issue, sold through specially formed Chase Manhattan Grantor Trust 1996-A, was given a coupon of 5.2 percent and priced at 99 31/32 , to yield 5.278 percent, or about 41 basis points more than the Treasury's 6 percent note due in August 1997.
The selloff in the Treasury market was also linked to technical factors. Such technicals -- which study the relationships between market variables like price levels, volume and movement and try to gain insights into supply and demand for securities -- pointed to declining prices ahead, analysts said.
In futures trading, which affects the cash market because it trades at what participants believe will be rate levels months from now, the March Treasury bond contract tumbled to a close of 119 5/32 , 1/32 off its low of the day. The high for the session was 120 8/32 . Declines could also be traced to investors and dealers who do not like to hold long maturities over long weekends, so they sell the long end and buy the shorter maturities. And the expiration of options compounded the selling pressure yesterday.
Several reports yesterday pointed to weak economic growth, which in other circumstances might have bolstered the market. The Government reported that orders for durable goods -- products ranging from washing machines to jet aircraft -- rose 2.1 percent in December, following a a decline of eight-tenths of 1 percent in November. In a separate report, factory orders increased 1.3 percent in December, after a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in November.
The data indicated a slowing pace of business activity, said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities.
Noting that new orders for commercial aircraft dominated the gains in both durable goods and factory orders, Mr. Fine said aircraft orders "tend to be a lagging indicator and usually start to rise toward the mature phase of business expansion, and that seems to be the case currently as well."
Also yesterday, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose by 21,000 in the week ended last Saturday, well above expectations. And the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia released its index of regional business activity for February. The index rose from minus 16.6 in January, which was hurt by a blizzard, to 3.8 -- a level, Mr. Fine said, that "is not exactly gangbusters."
"All of these numbers in consort certainly lend further credence to the view that the Federal Open Market Committee is likely to ease interest rates once again in the near future, with both timing and extent a function of the data to be released over the next five weeks," Mr. Fine said, referring to the Federal Reserve's policy-making group.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Angry Man

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Pat Buchanan is not likely to be the Republican nominee in the end. Too many influential voices in the party think that would deliver the election to President Clinton. But his strong showing in the Iowa caucuses still matters a lot.
It reminds us, first, of the strength of the Christian right in the country -- and its fixation on the issue of abortion. 
 In Iowa, Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition controls the Republican Party. Members were at first divided among the several far-right candidates. But by caucus day most were for Mr. Buchanan, with his call to outlaw abortion under any and all circumstances. In his view, if a woman who was raped has an abortion, both she and the doctor should be criminally punished.
Extreme opposition to abortion is of course not limited to conservative Christians in Iowa. That viewpoint has more influence in Congress now than ever before, with important consequences.
Last month, for example, in an action that has not had sufficient attention, Congress drastically limited American support for family planning in poor countries. The United States provided $548 million for population programs abroad last year. With many poor countries suffering under the burden of rapidly growing populations, those funds may be the most important part of American aid.
U.S. law already forbids spending aid money for abortions. But House Republicans attached to the aid bill a proviso barring funds for any family planning organization that gives information on abortion. The Senate rejected that amendment.
Then Congress passed and President Clinton signed a "compromise" that actually guts the population funding. No money can be spent until next July 1. In the 15 months that follow, the program is to have $356 million -- a cut of 35 percent from the last annual appropriation.
The bill would allow the funding cuts to be lifted if by July 1 Congress passes a foreign-aid authorization bill. But the insistence of House Republicans on anti-abortion language makes that unlikely; Mr. Buchanan's showing in Iowa will if anything stiffen their position.
The Iowa vote for Pat Buchanan was, second, a signal of economic distress. Iowa is actually hurting less than many other states from the slide in real wages and the downsizing of business. But there are evidently economic fears there as elsewhere.
Alone among the Republican candidates, Mr. Buchanan has been running as an all-out economic nationalist. He attacks free trade and says he would pull the U.S. out of the World Trade Organization. He sounds a populist cry against heartless corporations, and he calls for stopping all immigration for five years.
Republicans from Newt Gingrich to Bob Dole and Phil Gramm have opposed the notion that the United States can prosper by building economic walls around itself. Big businessmen who support and finance the party mostly disagree, too. But some voters respond when Mr. Buchanan says he will stop American jobs going to Mexico and China.
Of course there is more to Pat Buchanan than policy. There is anger. Like George Wallace 30 years ago, he expresses the resentments of some working-class people, mostly male and white, at those they consider the elite. Or perhaps a better comparison is with Howard Beale, the character played by the late Peter Finch in the 1976 movie "Network," with his cry: "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore."
However Mr. Buchanan does in New Hampshire and after, he will be a force in the Republican campaign. Indeed, Bob Dole is already expressing more concern about economic losers. And in Iowa both he and Lamar Alexander, disgracefully, supported an anti-homosexual rally organized by Christian rightists.
At the 1992 Republican convention in Houston, Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson made fire-eating right-wing speeches that turned out to hurt George Bush. Some party leaders had hoped to avoid such excesses this year, and to calm down the abortion plank, and thus appeal to moderates. But it looks now as though the two Pats and their ideas will play a prominent part in San Diego next August.

HEADLINE: Rea Irvin: Wry Spirit In the Age Of Gatsby

BYLINE: By DAVID IVES; David Ives is a playwright whose works include "All in the Timing."

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS have been spoiled for 70 years now by The New Yorker, which has arrived weekly like a string of perfect martinis on some ideal butler's tray. Adult and aware, sexy and stylish, flattering us with its wit, sometimes painfully in the know, this magazine has represented our town to the rest of the world since the days of the flappers as the place to flap. I wonder how many other writers have come to New York from places like Chicago, as I did, because as a mere slip of a sliver of a seminarian I thought that New York was like, well, The New Yorker -- which is not unlike goi'g to Casablanca for the waters. Ever since its inception, The New Yorker has been not so much a periodical as a personality, and what can beat it for flash?
Rea Irvin (1881-1972) was the man who created that personality along with Harold Ross, the magazine's founder and first editor. As The New Yorker's first art editor, Irvin designed and chose covers, selected the type (still known as "Irvin type") and The New Yorker logotype on the cover, gathered artists and cartoonists, and contributed illustrations and cartoons himself. Maybe most famously, Irvin drew Eustace Tilley, the Regency fop with the monocle who appeared on the cover of the magazine's first issue in 1925 and has reappeared yearly (with one exception, in 1994) ever since. Irvin played von Sternberg to The New Yorker's Dietrich and gave it its "look," once and probably forever. 
 Now there's a show of Irvin's work at the Museum of the City of New York, and the next time you're hanging out on Fifth Avenue checking out our new Michelangelo because you crave some art, you must hike on up to 103d Street and see the real thing. The trip is particularly recommended for those period junkies and lost souls (like me) who reread "The Great Gatsby" at every possible opportunity and who know that New York is still in its heart a place where jazz is played in Harlem, where Cole Porter has a new musical opening on Broadway, wher' men wear tuxes in the evening and women silk stockings, where Prohibition is still on, and where the Round Table is still getting sauced at the Algonquin.
Among the 83 drawings, cartoons, illustrations and covers, published and unpublished, the exhibition includes Irvin's original drawing of Eustace Tilley, and even for those of us who have never understood the charm of that insufferable twit, the kick is still palpable, like standing in front of our city's own Rosetta Stone.
Someday some expert will track the decline of our civilization in the passage from magazines with illustrations on the cover to magazines with Brad Pitt on the cover, or this week's Shannen Doherty. In this scheme, The New Yorker is practically the sole remain'ng upholder of the values of human talent and invention, while other magazines are like those people who seem to think that good conversation means asking what movies you've seen.
Irvin's own covers both set and continually hit a very high standard indeed, and one can tour them in pursuit of any number of amusements and interests: humor (two men passing each other in sailboats, each boat named after the same woman); wit (a woman making herself up as Shiva, with a tangle of arms carrying the necessary accessories); topical references (La Guardia's 1933 election, World War II); the risque (a nudist dining room); period styles and attitudes (those dowagers with pince-nez, those affectless socialites); sociological shifts (those very un-P.C. blacks); economic shifts (note that "Price 15 Cents" in the upper right corner); the satisfactions of solid composition, elegant line and piquant color. One plump, dull, gray matron eyeing an exotically colored senorita brings to mind Wallace Stevens.
After Ross's death in 1951, Irvin's place at the magazine declined sharply. His final published New Yorker cover, from 1958, has something valedictory and touching in its golfer and caddy, reflected in a water trap, looking in the wrong directions for the lost golf ball that floats before them in the pond.
Covers aren't all of Irvin's story. He also did caricatures, parodies of Diego Rivera, Picasso and Uccello, a satirical, pseudo-Audubon series called "Our Native Birds," and brilliant Hogarthian cartoons like "Pastimes of the Intelligentsia," in which the rich have nothing better to do than toss cards into a hat.
The show also includes peculiarities like two Hitler covers for The New Yorker, one published and one not, and the cartoon triptych "A Nazi History of the World," whose flipness can now, in retrospect, stop the heart and trouble the mind. A quoted note from Ross to Irvin shows how limited indeed their perspective was: "Who takes the risk of Hitler bumping off or resigning before we go to press? I am putting payment through in full but if anything happens to Hitl'r I guess it's partly your responsibility."
We go to certain artists because we like their spirit. Irvin's records are sparse, the number of people who knew him in his prime is declining, and his artwork is almost all the spirit we have left of him. It is a spirit largely of gaiety and joie de vivre, detachment and glee. A photo of Irvin in the exhibition shows him posing as a Buddha on a Bermuda beach, smiling and looking high as a kite. You have until the 5th of May to commune with his delightful spirit.
 
When and Where
"The Talk of the Town: Rea Irvin of The New Yorker," a display of 83 drawings, covers and cartoons by the first art editor of the magazine, will be on view through May 5 at the Museum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue and 103d Street, Manhattan. Hours: Wednesdays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Sundays, 1 to 5 P.M.; closed on Mondays; groups only on Tuesdays, 10 A.M. to 2 P.M.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Finishes Up a Little On 'a Bit of Confusing Day'

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar closed slightly higher yesterday, though weakened late in the day by a drop in United States Treasury bonds.
Early in Asian trading, the dollar fell against the yen and other currencies on remarks by the Japanese Finance Minister that his country's interest rates could benefit from an increase. But those remarks were later countered by his deputy, leading to a strong rebound in the dollar. 
 Several hours later, in New York yesterday afternoon, the dollar slumped as the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell sharply.
"The dollar had its move up and its move back down," said Wayne Grigull, director of foreign exchange sales at Merrill Lynch.
Late in the day, the dollar traded at 1.4665 marks, up from 1.4644 on Wednesday. It settled at 105.55 yen, up from 106.25. The British pound fell to $1.5375 from $1.5419.
During the Asian trading session, Finance Minister Wataru Kubo of Japan suggested to a committee of Parliament that Japanese interest rates were too low and were hurting retirees relying on interest income.
Japan's key lending rate is at a record low, one-half of 1 percent. Higher interest rates tend to make a country's currency more attractive to investors, but Japan has been trying to weaken the yen to bolster the sales of its exporters.
As a result, Mr. Kubo's remarks "introduced a new variable into the market" and sent the dollar down versus the yen, Mr. Grigull said.
But Mr. Kubo's suggestions were followed by remarks by his administrative vice minister, Tadashi Ogawa, that were interpreted as a rejoinder to what Mr. Kubo had said.
As Mr. Grigull put it, "The assertion by Ogawa that, in fact, interest rates were likely to remain low put the market back on its bullish bias toward the dollar versus the yen."
Analysts also said that the dollar had been helped by rumors that the Japanese central bank was preparing to intervene in the market.
Still, late in the day, the dollar began following the American bond market lower, as the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell by more than a point. "The dollar's performance was adversely affected by the performance of the bond market," Mr. Grigull said. "It's been a bit of a confusing day."
In other trading, the dollar rose to 1.1970 Swiss francs, from 1.1955 francs on Wednesday, and to 5.0520 French francs, from 5.0460. The dollar also rose to 1,585 Italian lire, from 1,583 lire.

HEADLINE: Worth a Raise?

BYLINE: By James Lardner; James Lardner is the author of the forthcoming "Crusaders: The Hell-Raising Police Career of Detective David Durk."

 BODY:
Boiling mad over the passage of a sweetheart arbitration deal for New York City police officers, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has denounced the State Legislature and made unkind remarks about the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. He has reason to be upset, since the new law could mean big salary increases in the midst of a budget crisis. But he might also give thought to the long term -- to how the city could try to get a higher caliber of officer for its money.
The Mayor and the Police Commissioner, William Bratton, have already taken several steps to address what the Mollen Commission, in its 1994 report on corruption, called a widespread perception that "virtually anyone can become a New York City police officer." Most notably, they have imposed a requirement of 60 college credits and raised the minimum age from 20 to 22. 
 But in other ways recruiting remains a scandal -- one that helps explain some of the more attention-getting police scandals of recent years.
We give officers the power, under certain circumstances, to take human life. We send them into situations that call for courage and an ability to calm people down and mediate differences. We insist that they respect people's legal rights. And we choose them by a process that takes none of these considerations into account.
The principal screening device for applicants is still a Civil Service exam, which has been made only slightly more rigorous in the decade since Mayor Edward Koch dismissed Judith Piesco, the deputy personnel director, for telling a State Senate committee that a "functional illiterate" could pass it. Invariably, most applicants do pass -- 31,000 out of nearly 39,000 the last time around, in 1993. After that, the process has resembled a lottery, with only the most glaringly unfit candidates eliminated.
Perhaps the key qualification is prolonged availability. Three years will have passed before the department hires the first batch of people from the last exam. By then, many of the top scorers won't be around. "The cream gets skimmed off by other careers, and the people you get are the people who are unemployable elsewhere," said Michael Julian, who retired last year as the N.Y.P.D.'s chief of personnel.
The new emphasis on raising standards is welcome, but, having been a police officer in Washington, D.C., in the early 1970's, I can testify that some of the best and most decent officers I worked with didn't have a college credit to their names. I can also recall a few real incompetents who had graduated with honors. On balance, a better-educated force is a good idea. But if the goal is to hire intelligent, capable and dedicated people, why not actually look for those qualities?
The N.Y.P.D. could start by closely interviewing applicants who have successfully completed every other stage of the selection process, and by taking into account such now irrelevant factors as knowledge of foreign languages, volunteer work and reputation in the community. And hiring the best people -- fast.
Reform along these lines would of course present its own obstacles, like the inevitable litigation by rejected candidates. The city is facing such a suit from applicants who complain that the college requirement was unfairly added since they took the entrance exam. Yet it is on such arguments that the woefully lax system has thrived for many years. Surely New York deserves better.

HEADLINE: A Plan to Save the New York Region

 BODY:
In the last couple of years, the political leadership in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut has been enthralled by tax cuts as the primary means to revitalize economic growth. Now comes a different idea from the Regional Plan Association, which called this week for no less than $75 billion in public expenditures to upgrade urban centers, open spaces, highways, rail lines and schools throughout the New York metropolitan area. At stake, the association said, is whether the New York area is to prevent the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and remain relevant to the highly competitive economic forces sweeping the globe.
The cry of alarm from the Regional Plan Association, an independent group supported by foundations and private contributions, provides a timely reminder that the area's future cannot be taken for granted. Whereas the association's two previous reports on long-range planning, in 1929 and 1968, saw uncontrolled growth as the region's greatest threat, the latest report sees a risk of outright decline. The basic principle that the economy must be saved by investment in education, training and infrastructure is powerfully argued and persuasive. The main problem with the association's report is that it throws in almost every big planning idea that has been on the books for years, without establishing clear priorities. 
 A major reconstruction of the area's transportation arteries makes sense. It is surprising to learn that a mere 25 miles of new albeit very expensive rail lines would largely knit suburban commuter and city subway lines together more effectively. But the price tag for such rail routes connecting Long Island, the airports in Queens, Grand Central Terminal, lower Manhattan, New Jersey and the suburbs north of the city may prove too high to justify. Since the economic base is likely to remain relatively static, it may be hard to persuade taxpayers to foot the bill for a gigantic new system, along with the considerable expense of maintaining what is there now. But let the debate begin.
The association proposes that some sort of a regional bank be established, possibly financed by increased tolls, highway fees, gasoline taxes and other payments made by automobile owners. That is also a sensible idea. But one can argue whether a new tristate regional transportation authority is needed or whether the authorities that built the existing systems should simply be given the right leadership.
Another sound proposal is to build in the area's urban centers instead of chewing up more countryside with suburban sprawl and commercial centers. The region's open spaces are in danger of being engulfed by development. It will be an uphill battle to get people and businesses to settle in such currently bleak places as downtown Trenton or Bridgeport or depressed areas of New York City, but the battle is worth fighting.
The association's forward-looking report lays down a challenge in an era when local leadership seems determined to shut down or privatize public institutions instead of adapting them, to cut budgets rather than focus public spending creatively and to divide people rather than unite them around broad visions that could benefit everyone. The Regional Plan Association has performed a service by setting visionary goals and stirring public debate about how to get there.

HEADLINE: Labor Leader Plans Little Steps to Big Economic-Political Goal

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Aides to John J. Sweeney swear that as the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new president he has the vision thing, but Mr. Sweeney certainly seems to try his best to hide it. In his soft, matter-of-fact voice, he talks not in visions but in bits and pieces.
He talks about hiring 1,000 organizers to pull a million more workers into unions. He talks about creating a pro-labor research center to counter the Heritage Foundation and other conservative policy organizations. 
 He talks about recruiting more than 1,000 college students to work as interns this summer, helping organize workplaces and campaign for union-backed candidates. He talks about labor's plans to focus on 75 Congressional races and spend $35 million this year, far more than in the past, to help the Democrats keep the White House and win back the House.
Put all these pieces together, his aides say, and a vision emerges, one that calls for remaking the country's economic and political landscape. That vision would create, from labor's point of view, a virtuous circle in which union membership would climb and labor would move from the margins of the nation's discourse back to the center. This would not only give labor more leverage at the bargaining table but also enable it to elect more pro-union lawmakers.
They would in theory pass labor-friendly legislation, which would make it easier for unions to enlist even more workers, and this would in turn increase labor's clout in bargaining and elections and so on.
But to hear Mr. Sweeney tell it, his role in all this is mere blocking and tackling and not carrying out an ambitious political-economic vision that some labor experts say is as likely to succeed as a Hail Mary pass.
"My primary function is to rebuild the American labor movement," Mr. Sweeney said in a recent interview in a visit to New York. "If in that process, I can do some other things that will benefit the American labor movement and workers, then I will be involved there, too."
Many labor leaders and experts agree that Mr. Sweeney has an ambitious agenda and that it might take time for him to show results.
"He is not the kind of leader who will just by his very presence stir things up," said Richard W. Hurd, a professor of labor studies at Cornell University. "It's going to be his actions that stir things up."
Within the world of labor, it is widely agreed that Mr. Sweeney has not taken the world by storm since assuming the helm of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in late October. Part of the reason is his style. He is more tortoise than hare. He comes across as a genial Irish uncle and not as a firebreather like John L. Lewis, the tempestuous titan who built the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which merged with the American Federation of Labor in 1955.
Another reason for his slow start, aides say, is that Mr. Sweeney inherited a giant, lethargic bureaucracy that will take months, maybe years, to invigorate. Moreover, the aides say, after his narrow victory in the first contested election for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s presidency, he feels the need to move cautiously and heal the wounds. So he is seeking to manage by consensus, not an easy thing to do when the federation's executive council has 57 often-headstrong officials from different unions, many of which opposed his candidacy.
"It's a very complex bureaucracy," Mr. Sweeney said. "It's not like heading up an individual union or individual corporation. It's a federation with strong affiliates."
Mr. Sweeney has criss-crossed the country since October, giving speeches to city and state labor federations and newspaper strikers in Detroit and Boeing strikers in Washington. His favorite line has been, "America needs a raise."
But it remains unclear how such an applause line will translate into raises for the federation's 13 million members -- or for the nation's more than 100 million nonunion workers.
Mr. Sweeney acknowledges that he has no magic formula for raising wages. On one level, he is resorting to moral suasion, appealing to the consciences of business executives as he rails against "the greed of corporate America" and against companies' failure to share the good times with their workers despite record profits and surges in productivity.
But Mr. Sweeney recognizes that moral suasion will not be enough. The federation, he said, will back strikes as a way of pressuring management and is beefing up its "strategic department" to help unions outsmart and outmaneuver management in economic showdowns.
Key to his ambition of giving America a raise is electing a labor-friendly Congress, one he hopes will address the growing income gap between the richest 5 percent and the average working American.
"We need labor, business and government together at the table to address the seriousness of this wage problem and to find solutions" he said. "We can start by supporting an increase in the minimum wage."
The Republican Congress appears unlikely to enact a higher minimum wage, now $4.25, and that is one reason Mr. Sweeney wants to help the Democrats win back the House. When the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council meets next week in Bal Harbour, Fla., a main item on the agenda will be to pick the 75 Congressional races on which to devote resources.
That is just part of the federation's expanded political program. It plans to train 2,500 union advocates to spread labor's message during the campaign. It has pledged to send 100 union advocates into each of the 435 Congressional districts during the campaign's last six weeks. As for its $35 million war chest, most of that will go not to candidate contributions but to get out the vote and educate voters on where candidates stand on issues dear to workers' hearts.
The federation hopes to replicate its recent work in Oregon, where scores of union activists campaigned to help Ron Wyden, a Democrat, win a Senate seat.
"The A.F.L. is committed to putting more into the political campaign than we have ever put before," Mr. Sweeney said. "We're very encouraged by the results of the Oregon race. It's just the first, and we expect many more victories."
But many political experts predict that Mr. Sweeney will fall short of his political goals.
"What he's trying to do is replicate the conservative success of the past two years," said Marshall Wittmann, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation. "The major difference is the general political trend in the country is in a conservative direction, and the conservatives harnessed that political trend."
As the campaign gathers steam, Mr. Sweeney voices far more enthusiasm about President Clinton than about the Republican Presidential field, even though Patrick J. Buchanan and Senator Bob Dole seem to have stolen his oratory about how corporations are giving their workers a raw deal.
Mr. Sweeney is decidedly unsympathetic to Republican economic proposals: cutting taxes and spending and building protectionist walls.
"I wish there was a Republican who was trying to find solutions for the problems that American workers are facing," he said.
As for the Republicans' idea of the month, he said, "the flat-tax proposal is unfair to middle-income and low-income workers." "I think it favors the wealthy," Mr. Sweeney added.
Although the federation has not yet endorsed a candidate, Mr. Sweeney was not shy about tipping his hand.
"I think the courage the President has displayed in standing up for some basic programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment indicates how dedicated he is to supporting programs that are important to American workers."
Part of Mr. Sweeney's agenda is to make the Democratic Party identify more closely with unions. He recognizes that many Democrats have distanced themselves from organized labor, viewing it as just another special interest group.
He said such a characterization was terribly unfair, but added: "I don't get upset being referred to as representing a special interest. If representing American workers is a special interest, then I'm proud to represent that special interest."

HEADLINE: Fresh Data Indicate Economy Could Be Heading for a Stall

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Evidence mounted today that the economy, whose growth has been slowing markedly in recent months, could be approaching a stall.
Only a small minority of economists and business leaders are predicting recession, but many believe that growth in the January-March quarter will be at a rate of 1 percent or less, roughly half what the economy could produce without causing inflation. 
 "What we're looking at is a clear progression toward weaker growth," said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist at ASB Capital Management, a large Washington investment firm. He predicted little, if any, economic expansion in the current quarter, citing Northeast snowstorms and the partial shutdown of the Government as only two of several factors.
One of the half-dozen economic gauges published today was the Labor Department's report that first-time claims for unemployment benefits surged by an unexpectedly large 21,000 last week. That brought the average number of claims being filed in the last four weeks to 388,500, the highest in four years, except for one week last July when it was inflated by seasonal layoffs in the automobile industry.
This "is very clearly depicting intensified deterioration in the labor market," Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the brokerage firm, told its clients.
In a second Government report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of general business conditions rebounded from a dismal, weather-related January reading of minus 16.6, but only to a positive 3.8 in February. Economists said that hardly portrayed economic strength.
They also cited companion indexes pointing to lower employment, a shorter workweek and a drop of two price indexes to 28-year lows.
Still another Government report found that orders to factories climbed 1.3 percent in December and fell one-tenth of 1 percent in November, both results having been delayed by the Federal shutdown.
Analysts tended to disregard these figures as too old to provide much insight and as highly distorted by a bunching of orders for aircraft, an erratic component involving a product that may not be produced until years later.
Not counting aircraft and military orders, economists at Merrill Lynch noted that most industries producing durable goods had fewer orders in December and that many posted November declines as well.
Today's outpouring of data -- there were at least four private-sector surveys in addition to the three Government reports -- came as politicians as well as economists cast an anxious eye at the economic weather.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas this week joined his rival Patrick Buchanan in focusing on pocketbook concerns in the campaign leading to next week's New Hampshire primary.
Many of the signs of a weakening economy have until recently been at least partly offset by a solid performance in manufacturing, though the Northeast blizzard contributed to a substantial contraction of factory payrolls in January.
But consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of national output, have become increasingly pessimistic, raising the possibility that their retrenchment could hold economic growth well below par or perhaps bring on a recession.
An ABC-Money magazine survey of consumer confidence showed a decline to minus 18 last week from minus 16 the week before, it was reported today, reflecting further gradual deterioration.
The National Association of Home Builders said its housing market index for new, single-family homes edged down 1 point, to 50, in February, a reading that means the number of positive responses from builders about equals the negative responses. Present sales fell 3 points, sales expectations for the next six months were 1 point lower, while traffic of prospective buyers climbed 2 points, to 39, the association said.
Mortgage applications for home purchases fell last week to the lowest level since August, though refinancing activity was still strong, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported.
The National Association of Manufacturers said a poll of its members taken last Friday found more than 75 percent of executives favored further relaxation of monetary policy to overcome "sluggish growth" this year. More than 90 percent of its board members, however, said there was little chance of recession.
Still another survey, by Dun & Bradstreet of 1,000 manufacturers, found them "optimistic about short-term economic conditions" through April despite "nearly stagnant" conditions over the latest three months. The company's industrial sentiment index for the coming three months climbed 2 points, to 20, in January. In January 1993 the index registered 23.
The Commerce Department's report on factories showed orders for durable goods up 2.1 percent in December following declines of eight-tenths of 1 percent in November and 1.5 percent in October.
But orders for nonmilitary capital goods other than aircraft fell four-tenths of 1 percent in December and 2.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 1995.
Shipments of factory goods over all rose 1 percent in December, while unfilled orders rose three-tenths of 1 percent and inventories edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, the report found.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid Cutbacks Endangering Population Programs, U.N. Agencies Say

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 15

 BODY:
In the latest tactical victory by a resurgent anti-abortion movement in the United States, Congress has forced a drastic cut in aid that is the mainstay of family planning programs around the world.
Recent legislation, intended to punish the Clinton Administration for allowing aid for family planning groups involved in abortions overseas, cuts 35 percent from the population and family planning budget of the Agency for International Development, the largest supporter of such programs in the world. 
 Experts at the agency and at many of the private organizations who depend on the funds say the cut will be crippling, not only to birth control programs but also to related activities like maternal health care and AIDS prevention.
The measure was part of a foreign appropriations bill attached to legislation to prevent another Government shutdown, and was signed by the President.
Sponsors of the measure, led by Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, wanted a complete ban on aid to organizations that perform or promote abortions abroad -- in effect a reinstatement and a strengthening of Reagan and Bush Administration anti-abortion policies that were overturned by President Clinton.
Although American law still prohibits using aid money for abortion services abroad, many family planning and women's health groups receiving American support provide a range of services that may include abortion counseling, especially in cases of extreme poverty where additional births could weaken a mother's health or add unendurable financial burdens.
"The fiction advanced by the other side -- that international population-control agencies can use bookkeeping devices to spend 'their' money on abortions and 'our' money on everything else -- ignores reality," Mr. Smith said in an interview. "If population-control organizations insist that they want population money only for family planning activities unrelated to abortion, they could do so under the House provisions by getting out of the abortion business."
When the Senate balked at this blanket prohibition, House Republicans agreed instead to the 35 percent cut, combined with a delay in dispensing funds that will make the cutbacks this year even more severe.
If Democrats agree to reconsider their opposition to the anti-abortion measure, the delay in dispensing of funds could be lifted, somewhat easing the impact, but both sides consider this very unlikely.
Measured in dollars, the cut would reduce A.I.D. funds for family planning to $360 million in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, from $550 million the previous year. Over all, the United States now provides 45 percent of all international aid for population programs. Beyond these cuts, Washington is also sharply reducing its support for the United Nations Population Fund.
Estimates of how the cutbacks will affect family planning efforts vary wildly, but most experts agree the impact will be severe.
Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, an outspoken abortion critic who has long advocated family planning, said the reduction in appropriations meant the agency would have only 14 percent of what was available in the fiscal year 1995 to spend on such programs this year.
"What we did is bar access to family planning services to approximately 17 million couples, most of them living in unimaginable poverty," he said in a statement.
At the United Nations Population Fund, Nafis Sadik, the executive director, said, "The way U.S. funding is going, 17 to 18 million unwanted pregnancies are going to take place, a couple of million abortions will take place, and I'm sure that 60,000 to 80,000 women are going to die because of those abortions -- and all because the money has been reduced overnight."
The agency, which received $35 million in 1995 from a separate State Department budget, is to get $22.5 million over a 15-month period beginning in July, which in effect provides the agency with only $4.5 million in the current fiscal year.
But Mr. Smith added, "It is impossible for either side in this debate to prove how many 'unwanted' pregnancies will or will not occur at a given level of funding for population-control programs.
The Representative said that too much money was being spent on population programs, and that the figure had risen rapidly over the past three years. He said foreign aid would be better spent on "programs that save the lives of children, protect refugees fleeing persecution and create free and self-sustaining economic systems."
Echoing arguments made by some third world leaders, he questions the cultural implications of family planning.
"Is there really a population crisis?" he asked at a Congressional hearing last year. "Is there any hard evidence that we are in imminent danger of not having enough resources for the world's population? Or is fewer people just an aesthetic preference of the West?"
But family planning advocates say that regardless of arguments about global population and resources, efforts are needed to give more women choice in contraception for reasons of health and personal freedom.
Even while voting to cut money for family planning, Republican House members point out that they have protected funds for child survival.
"But family planning has always been controversial and is even more so with the Republicans in charge," said Jo Bonner, staff director for Representative Sonny Callahan, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. He said it would be difficult "to ask the American taxpayer to support an increase in foreign aid when we're cutting back on domestic programs."

HEADLINE: Trenton G.O.P. Leaders Agree on a Charity Care Plan

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
On the day the state first missed its monthly payment to reimburse hospitals for providing medical treatment to the poor, Republican legislative leaders agreed today to pay for the state's charity care program by continuing to use surplus revenues from the unemployment insurance fund.
Hospital officials had feared that they would have had to begin laying off workers and closing wards if the state had not taken steps toward resuming payments. Today, the state had been scheduled to distribute $33 million to 84 hospitals. 
 The state stopped payment after its authority to rely on the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund ended on Dec. 31. State officials have not come up with a replacement for the expired system.
But the agreement, reached by the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican from Scotch Plains, and the Assembly Speaker, Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County, would provide $300 million to hospitals this year, a $100 million reduction from what was distributed to hospitals last year. The plan proposes to phase out dependence on the unemployment insurance fund over five years and eventually pay the entire cost of charity care from the state budget's general fund by the year 2000.
"We are obligated to take care of everybody who walks in the door," said Dr. Jonathan M. Metsch, president and chief executive of the Jersey City Medical Center. "It is time to stop the political posturing and solve this problem."
Under pressure from businesses and organized labor to stop draining the unemployment insurance fund, Legislative leaders and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman agreed last year to consider alternatives. Governor Whitman proposed to increase the cigarette tax by 25 cents last November, but the Legislature rejected that idea. Since then, state legislators have floated more than a dozen other proposals, varying from using unspent Medicaid dollars to raising money from video poker games. Today's plan, however, was the first proposal made by the leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature.
Governor Whitman withheld comment on the plan, which has to be passed by both houses and signed by her before it can take effect. "We are certainly going to take a serious look at this," Becky Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Governor, said.
While hospital officials said they were relieved that the legislative leaders had finally agreed on a proposal, business officials expressed disappointment that the plan would still depend heavily on the state's Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. Since 1993, the state has financed the charity care program by diverting almost $1.6 billion from the state fund, wiping out much of the fund's surplus.
"Based on the numbers we have seen, we are very disappointed with this proposal," said Edward Rogan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. "It continues an unacceptable raid on the unemployment insurance fund. Our goal was to end the diversion as soon as possible."
Under the plan, the state would take only $13 million from the state budget's general fund this year, but $68 million next year. In 1998, the state would use $168 million from the general fund, $268 million in 1999, and $400 million in the year 2000.
State officials would spend a total of $400 million this year for medical treatment of uninsured families and individuals. The plan would distribute $300 million to reimburse hospitals that care for the poor, a $100 million cut from last year.
The plan also would provide $50 million to partly replace a $75 million cut that Governor Whitman has proposed in the state's Hospital Relief Fund. In addition, the plan would reduce spending from $100 million to $50 million for a year-old health insurance plan for people who meet certain income eligibility requirements and are not eligible for employee-sponsored health insurance coverage or Medicaid.
Because the state had failed to come up with a way to replenish the state fund that expired Dec. 31, hospital officials around the state, particularly in urban areas, had been worried about how they would continue to provide medical treatment for the poor without any reimbursement. The State Health Department has stopped taking applications from hundreds of New Jerseyans seeking health insurance under the state-subsidized program.
Dr. Metsch said that Jersey City Medical Center received $25 million a year in state funds for charity care. He said that about one-third of the 18,000 admissions last year were people who were not covered by health insurance or Medicaid.
At University Hospital in Newark, which receives $48 million annually to treat thousands of charity care patients, William Vazquez, vice president and chief executive, said that he had ordered a hiring freeze last month because the state had not yet come up with a solution. Today, his hospital failed to receive $4 million from the state that it had expected before the old system expired.
"Our bank account is short $4 million," Mr. Vazquez said today. "What it means is that once again we will be providing more care than we are reimbursed for."

HEADLINE: Hasidic Volunteers Help Find Suspect in Beating

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
A combination of basic detective work by a Hasidic volunteer patrol and the chance presence of a police car outside a Lower East Side bagel shop led to the capture yesterday of a Hasidic man whose estranged wife was found beaten unconscious on Saturday in her Monsey, N.Y., home.
While groups like the Shomrim Volunteer Patrol have sometimes been criticized by those outside Hasidic communities for vigilantism, the Shomrim patrol this time helped track down a member of its own community -- one charged last night with attempted murder. 
 Scores of Shomrim, Hebrew for "guardians," had been hunting for the suspect, Joseph Zitrenbaum, in the Jewish neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Borough Park, in Brooklyn, and the Lower East Side since the assault on his wife, Blima Zitrenbaum, 33. They distributed fliers with the picture of Mr. Zitrenbaum, who is unemployed, figuring he would need to beg for food and money among the area's merchants. Tipped that Mr. Zitrenbaum was seen without a beard, they distributed a beardless photograph on the flier.
As it turned out, Mr. Zitrenbaum, wearing traditional black garb but clean-shaven except for a mustache, was spotted not by a Shomrim member but by Michael Fleischer, 52, the owner of a takeout store, G & M Kosher Caterers, at 41 Essex Street. Mr. Fleischer, who lives in Monsey and knew that Mr. Zitrenbaum was wanted, saw him eating a bagel with a cup of coffee at Motty's Bagels at 39 Essex Street.
Mr. Fleischer said he had first spotted Mr. Zitrenbaum on Tuesday, when Mr. Zitrenbaum was walking through the neighborhood, but he lost him after trailing him for six blocks.
This time, Mr. Fleischer hurriedly yelled to a neighboring merchant, Zachariah Eisenbach, a Torah scribe, to call the Shomrim while he flagged down a police car on the other side of Essex. Police Officer Robert Pandolsi strode into the bagel shop and arrested Mr. Zitrenbaum, who was described as pale and shaken but did not resist.
David Wieder, a Shomrim volunteer, said he was already in the store when the police entered and was blocking the doorway in case Mr. Zitrenbaum tried to get away. Other Shomrim streamed toward the store, alerted through two-way radios by their dispatcher in Williamsburg.
Mr. Zitrenbaum, a 36-year-old former furniture salesman with what the police and neighbors described as a drug problem, had been wanted for questioning by the police in Ramapo, which embraces Monsey, since Saturday. That morning, Mrs. Zitrenbaum, who had obtained an order of protection against her husband, was found unconscious, her face and head bloody, by one of her seven children. The police said she had been beaten with a hammer-like instrument. She has been hospitalized in critical condition, unable to talk, although neighbors said yesterday that she seemed to be increasingly alert.
The case drew attention within the metropolitan area's large Hasidic community because family violence requiring police intervention is rare. Mr. Zitrenbaum was returned to Ramapo yesterday afternoon. He is to be arraigned today on a charge of attempted murder, the police said.
No warrant had been issued in his wife's beating, so the New York City police based their arrest on three outstanding warrants, including one from Fort Lee, N.J., charging him with carrying a hypodermic needle and resisting arrest.
Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for the Shomrim, said the group was founded 15 years ago in Williamsburg and had since branched out to other Orthodox Jewish areas. It has 250 members, he said. They do not carry guns or wear uniforms and respond when help is needed for anything from burglaries to lost children.
The Shomrim actively worked to locate Mr. Zitrenbaum, Mr. Abraham said, because "we don't think the Ramapo police have the capability of doing this kind of search and the precincts in New York have their own guys they're looking for."

HEADLINE: Report on Port Authority Says It Favors New Jersey

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Adding statistical weight to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's assertion that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey slights New York City, Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate, said yesterday that the authority favors New Jersey in its capital spending and transportation services.
Mr. Green said that half of $7.4 billion spent on capital projects from 1980 through 1994 went to New Jersey, which has fewer than a third of the residents of the metropolitan area served by the Port Authority. On that basis, the analysis found that the authority spent $851 for each New Jersey resident, compared with $485 for each New York resident. 
 The Green analysis found that the agency made $1.2 billion in that period, but that the profit was dragged down by $3.2 billion in losses that came primarily from the New Jersey PATH system, the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and other operations "overwhelmingly engaged in transporting New Jersey residents," the report said.
"Fifteen years of data confirm that the Port Authority is a giant transfer machine that forces New York to cross-subsidize New Jersey's economic development and low taxes," Mr. Green said.
A Democrat who was elected in 1992 as New York City's first Public Advocate, Mr. Green holds a post that puts him in almost inevitable conflict with the Mayor. But in the Port Authority report, Mr. Green gave Mr. Giuliani a rare endorsement. That is because the Mayor has been harshly critical of the Port Authority's financing, even threatening to pull out of the two-state partnership under which the authority has functioned since the 1920's.
"Giuliani got it right, and here is the data to prove it," Mr. Green said.In a news conference, he said his staff had been at work for a year on the Port Authority analysis, and had begun the work before the Mayor had criticized the agency's finances.
Port Authority officials dismissed the report, saying it was politically biased and skewed because it reflected unusually large short-term investments made during the 1980's to upgrade the PATH system and Newark International Airport. The authority's capital spending plan for the next five years calls for devoting 67 percent of its financing to New York City operations, particularly Kennedy International Airport.
The report also praised a 25-year master plan for the New York region, proposed on Tuesday by the Regional Plan Association. It envisions the creation of a Regional Transportation Authority, taking charge of all suburban commuter trains, New York City subways and buses, and the bridges and tunnels the Port Authority owns, leaving only the region's airports and marine terminals under the authority's control.
While saying that he would support such a regionwide agency, Mr. Green said yesterday that he also favored more narrowly focused alternatives, including raising fares on the PATH system by 50 cents, to $1.50, equal to a New York City ride, and increasing the tolls at New Jersey bridges and tunnels operated by the authority by $2, to $6, the same as charged by the city's Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
The increased proceeds should be used to pay for improvements at some of the authority's New York City properties, Mr. Green said, including Kennedy Airport.
The analysis by Mr. Green's staff comes six months after another, by the New York City Planning Department, that also found that the authority was losing money on the PATH system and other New Jersey operations. But yesterday's report went further, examining capital spending on projects considered of more direct benefit to New Jersey residents and commuters than people in New York state.
"These things are cyclical," said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who responded to Mr. Green's report late yesterday at a news conference after she met with Gov. George E. Pataki to discuss a range of issues affecting their states. "We've gotten a lot of Port Authority spending lately, but five years from now New York will probably be in the same position."
Governor Pataki, however, was less dismissive of the report. When asked if New Jersey was being favored by the authority, he said, "I think so, yes." But he said he would oppose dismantling the agency.
H. Claude Shostal, the president of the Regional Plan Association, said: "We are delighted with Mr. Green's support, but it is unfortunate that it is couched in rivalry between New York and New Jersey."

HEADLINE: Board Delays Ban on Affirmative Action, but Discord Persists

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The University of California's deeply divided Regents compromised today and set spring 1998 as the date for putting into effect their much-disputed ban on race and sex preferences in undergraduate student admissions.
But the fight over affirmative action did not end there for the university, a 160,000-student, nine-campus system that is one of the nation's largest and most respected educational institutions. No sooner was the new date agreed upon, and passed on a voice vote at a monthly meeting of the 26-member Regents board, than both sides on the issue began squabbling anew over just what policy was to be put into effect. 
 A task force established earlier this year by the board was already at work trying to sort this out -- thus far, without success.
The ban on race and sex preferences, narrowly passed last summer during a tumultuous Regents meeting, was originally scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 1997. But the university president, Richard C. Atkinson, argued that it would take at least until mid-1998 to work out new policies on admitting students. Mr. Atkinson briefly attempted to delay the ban unilaterally, but the board objected.
With the strong support of faculty and students, Mr. Atkinson also questioned the wisdom of the ban, given that California is the nation's most ethnically diverse state.
He reiterated his position today, again putting himself in direct confrontation with Gov. Pete Wilson, who not only sits on the board but is one of the most outspoken opponents of affirmative action in the nation.
Today's compromise, involving the timing of when the new policy would govern admissions, came relatively easily. But the fight over defining the policy itself seemed no closer to resolution than when the ban was first proposed and passed. And the chasm between the Governor and Mr. Atkinson seemed at least as wide and deep as ever.
The ban states that the university "shall not use race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for admission to the university" or "as a criterion in its employment and contracting practices." But it says social and economic disadvantages can be taken into account.
Some board members, led by Mr. Atkinson, maintained today that the wording of the new policy was loose enough to allow some consideration of race.
"At the level of outreach and financial aid, I'm of the opinion we could still be race-attentive," Mr. Atkinson said at an impromptu hallway press conference.
But other board members, including Mr. Wilson and Ward Connerly, the author of the ban, contended that the affirmative action proponents were being semantically disingenuous. They insisted that the intent of the ban was clear, although some, Mr. Connerly among them, acknowledged that the language did not specifically forbid "outreach" to various ethnic groups in admissions and granting financial assistance.
"It's complex and needs further study, but it's nevertheless clear what we seek to do," Mr. Connerly said.
With Governor Wilson, Mr. Connerly is also leading an effort to put affirmative action up for a statewide yes-or-no vote on the fall election ballot. Affirmative-action defenders contend that Mr. Connerly and the Governor deliberately sought the campus ban to gain attention for the ballot initiative and to raise Mr. Wilson's political profile.
Before today's Regents meeting, on the San Francisco campus, Governor Wilson and President Atkinson held a private meeting that aides to both described as polite but tense.
In other board business, the Regents received the resignation, effective in mid-1977, of Chancellor Charles E. Young of the University of California at Los Angeles. In 25 years in that post, Mr. Young oversaw the campus's growth in size and reputation. He has strongly supported affirmative action.
Mr. Young said it was time to turn over the chancellorship, including the affirmative-action dispute, to someone else. But he did not imply that the contentiousness of the affirmative action issue had weighed heavily in making his retirement plans.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Forbes's Three-Pronged Approach

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

 BODY:
There are two new 30-second television advertisements that have begun appearing in New Hampshire for the final week before the primary. One is titled "Education" and the other is "Parents." They are being broadcast along with a third commercial, called "Healthcare," that was also shown in Iowa. 
 All three show Steve Forbes involved with subjects other than his proposal for a flat income tax, the issue that thrust him into the first-tier of contenders for the Republican nomination. The ads' messages are generalized ones in which Mr. Forbes tries to demonstrate his understanding of the concerns of ordinary voters.
 
PRODUCER Our Towns Films.
 
ON THE SCREEN In two commercials, Mr. Forbes is in a shirt and tie, sitting in a warm and clubby looking study with photographs of his children behind him. In "Education," an announcer says, "For 30 years, Washington politicians have tried to run schools -- and failed. Test scores have dropped. Three out of four eighth graders are below grade level in math."
Mr. Forbes then appears to denounce the Federal Government's role in education. "Hi, I'm Steve Forbes," he says. "Today, local schools have to fill out 173 Federal forms. Washington is out of control. We should restore control of our schools to parents."
In "Parents," Mr. Forbes comes closer to expounding his economic theories, although they are referred to only vaguely. He tells viewers that even families with two incomes can barely make ends meet.
"If we change Washington," he says, "we can cut taxes and mortgage rates. Wage earners can save more, and parents can devote more time to their children."
"Healthcare" features some of the plaudits for by the health care plan at Mr. Forbes's magazine company.
 
ACCURACY Mr. Forbes's use of education as a tool to attack at Washington is questionable. Although most functions of government are a blend of national and local, education is an area in which the Federal role is decidedly subordinate.
In "Parents" Mr. Forbes suggests that following his economic policies will not only make people more prosperous but also better family members. This assertion rests on the hard-to-prove assertion that wage earners will respond to lower taxes by spending more time with their children.
 
SCORE CARD The advertisements are collectively intended to show that Mr. Forbes is something other than a single-issue candidate. They also feature him on camera in a kind of straining-to-be-comfortable look. Focus groups have shown that some people find his nonpolitician appearance appealing, while many find it disconcerting.

2 Canadian Banks Buy or Raise Stakes in Bancomer and Inverlat

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Two of Canada's largest banks, the Bank of Montreal and the Bank of Nova Scotia, are betting on a recovery of Mexico's economy and currency by investing in Mexican financial-services companies.
The Montreal institution, Canada's third-largest bank, said today that it would acquire a 16 percent equity interest and a 20 percent voting stake in Grupo Financiero Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest bank, for a price between $425 million and $475 million. 
 The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's fourth largest, said it would increase its current 5 percent stake in Grupo Financiero Inverlat S.A. to 16 percent by investing $50 million more in the financially shaky bank. It also said that it might increase its stake to as much as 55 percent in the next four years.
"They want to be the first to capitalize on any opportunities" from the North American Free Trade Agreement, said Enrique Gelbard, a senior economist for the Royal Bank of Canada. "Mexican companies are very attractive investments right now, since any Mexican investment is undervalued because of the low value of the peso."
The peso is recovering from a several-stage decline over a period of about a year after its devaluation in December 1994, closing in trading today at 7.525 to the dollar. This represents a modest improvement from the peso's low point late in 1995, when it reached intraday lows of more than 8 to the dollar.
Beyond that, Mexican interest rates have declined some in the last two or three months, as the Government repaid or rolled over some United States debt and Mexican bond and note prices rose. And the Mexico City stock market has been rising.
The Bank of Montreal said it expected to close its purchase of the Bancomer stake by March 31, with the final price subject to fluctuations in currency and share prices.
Its strategy is to be a significant participant in both Mexico and the United States, Canada's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement, said Jeff Chisholm, the Bank of Montreal's vice chairman. The bank also owns Chicago-based Harris Bancorp.
The Bank of Nova Scotia, which is based here, acquired a 5 percent equity interest in Inverlat, Mexico's fifth-largest bank, in August 1992 for $75 million (U.S.).
It also owns $46.4 million of Inverlat bonds that can be converted into 3.1 percent more, for a total just over 8 percent.
The Bank of Nova Scotia said it would acquire a further $125 million of Inverlat bonds, which mature in eight years. There were conflicting reports as to whether the bonds were convertible into Inverlat equity.
Inverlat has been among the most troubled of Mexican banks with overdue loans representing 16 percent of its portfolio, compared with 10.7 percent for the Mexican banking system on average.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: IN THE PACK;
Alexander, the Contender, Says He Avoids the Negative

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: PETERBOROUGH, N.H., Feb. 15

 BODY:
In the three days since he became a contender, Lamar Alexander has asserted in every speech that voters in Iowa rewarded him on Monday for rising above the negative tactics employed by his rivals.
But while campaigning in New Hampshire, much of Mr. Alexander's message has itself been a negative one. While the former Tennessee governor does not shun discussion of his policy positions, the essence of his strategy here has been to convince voters that his primary rivals, Senator Bob Dole and Patrick J. Buchanan, are both fatally flawed as candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination and as challengers to President Clinton. His goal, it often seems, is election by process of elimination. 
 But unlike many modern-day candidates, Mr. Alexander swipes at his opponents with a velvet touch, not brass knuckles. He emphasizes his respect for Mr. Dole before suggesting that the majority leader is past his prime and has no vision. He praises Mr. Buchanan for his energy before dismissing him as a protectionist with "wrong ideas."
He denies that his negative ads are negative, including the one that labels Mr. Dole as "a Washington insider for 35 years" and Steve Forbes as "a Wall Street insider his entire life."
Asked on Tuesday what was wrong with Wall Street, Mr. Alexander said: "I didn't say it was a bad thing. I just said it was a fact."
Growing support for him in polls seems to suggest that Mr. Alexander's strategy -- executed against the backdrop of relentless negative advertising from his competitors -- is working.
"He doesn't take underhanded shots," said Gordon L. Kemp, a 71-year-old retired truck mechanic who said he was leaning toward Mr. Alexander here after hearing him today. "He doesn't devote a whole 30-second blob on TV to saying the guy did wrong."
Today, Mr. Alexander paid a left-handed compliment to Mr. Dole by describing him as "our most respected legislative engineer."
"We must bring ourselves to say to Bob Dole, 'We appreciate your long service in the Senate but you're not the right man to have that debate with Bill Clinton and you're not the right man to be the first President of the next century,' " he told several hundred listeners today at the Peterborough Town Hall. "It's time for new leadership. It's time to move on."
In criticizing Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Alexander, and his surrogates, like the former Education Secretary, William J. Bennett, have taken to depicting the television commentator as an economic liberal who masquerades as a conservative.
"We don't think on economic issues that Pat Buchanan is on the right," Mr. Alexander said at a news conference with Mr. Bennett on Wednesday. "He has Robert Reich's industrial policy. He has George McGovern's foreign policy."
Today, Mr. Alexander criticized Mr. Buchanan without naming him. "Some people want to keep their focus on the job drain," he said. "They know we're nervous about our jobs. They want to build a trade wall around American and that won't work."
Mr. Alexander said today that his campaign "represents new ideas," while adding that "Senator Dole represents not very many ideas and Pat Buchanan represents the wrong ideas."
And in the last two days, surrounded at every appearance by a scrum of cameramen, he has taken advantage of his newfound media attention to spell out positions on welfare and education in an effort to establish conservative credentials.
Speaking at a forum on Wednesday in Laconia, Mr. Alexander said, "What I would do is to cancel the Washington welfare and take the same amount of money that Laconia sends to Washington, that Nashville sends to Washington, and spend it at home through neighborhood charities, through boys' and girls' clubs, through the emergency shelters. It takes a much bigger heart to say I will help you than to say, I will hire the Government to help you."
At appearances today, Mr. Alexander proposed abolishing the Federal Department of Education, sending Federal education dollars back to the states, and establishing a "G.I. Bill for Kids" that would provide $1,000 scholarships for poor and middle-income students in areas that promote school choice.
"It would help those families take back their schools and give their children more good education by allowing them more choices of schools," he said at Keene State College. "The surest ticket for the future is to help a poor child go to a good school."
In addressing many social problems, Mr. Alexander avoids Government prescriptions altogether and calls for families to take more personal responsibility.
In a favored anecdote, he tells of carrying a pocketknife to school every day while a boy in Maryville, Tenn., an act that he says would be prohibited today under Federal law. No one ever thought of actually using the weapons against another student, he says.
"It had everything to do with the families we came from, the nosy neighbors who tried to keep us out of trouble, the algebra teacher who kept her eye on us, the scout leaders who kept us busy, whoever it was that drug us to church three times a week because it was good for us," he said in Laconia on Wednesday.
Mr. Alexander acknowledges that times have changed. "But we've spent 40 or 50 years trying to invent substitutes for strong families, strong neighbors, strong churches, strong synagogues, strong schools, and we've flunked. We haven't found any. So what I think we need is a President who leads us into the next century with a conservative vision of the future. Strong defense, good new jobs, controlling our borders, yes. But more importantly, asking less of Washington and more of ourselves."

HEADLINE: Fed Nominee Offered No New Direction;
Proved to Be Right

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "White House Rebukes G.O.P. for Scuttling Nominee to Fed" (news article, Feb. 14): 
 When the Republican politicians in power said they would not allow Felix G. Rohatyn to serve as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve because they were afraid his economic views might vary from theirs, they confessed again to what has become obvious.
Their rigid, simplistic ideology abhors subtle intelligence and intellectual integrity.
Mr. Rohatyn has proved himself to be right while helping to save New York from fiscal and economic chaos, and predicting the course of the national economy over the last 20 years. Some of the smartest Republican business leaders seek his counsel because they trust his judgment.
Maybe the Republican politicians in Washington should learn a little more respect for the private sector. Their shortsightedness has denied the United States a valuable public servant.

HEADLINE: In Quick Tour, Clinton Touches Critical Base

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
The Clinton-Gore campaign and the two men who happen to head it came barnstorming into New York and New Jersey yesterday, shaking the money tree, touching political bases in a pair of states vital to their re-election and offering a vigorous defense of Felix G. Rohatyn and pro-growth economic policies.
In a packed fund-raising dinner in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Clinton was well into a half-hour recitation of his record in office when he lashed out sharply at Republican Congressional critics who had led Mr. Rohatyn, the New York investment banker, to withdraw his candidacy for nomination as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 The President denounced such attacks as "outrageous political treatment," asked the audience to applaud Mr. Rohatyn -- who was in the ballroom of the Sheraton New York -- and said that the Government should vigorously debate how fast the economy could grow without prompting too much inflation.
"That's what I wanted to see done," Mr. Clinton added. "And that's why I wanted to put Felix Rohatyn on the Federal Reserve. But the politics of Washington said, no, we insist on the conventional wisdom, we insist on holding people down, we don't even think it's worth debating -- over and out. That is wrong, and we must end that kind of thinking if we want this country to grow and prosper and become what it ought to be."
Mr. Clinton spent a good part of the day trying to insure that his own re-election campaign would grow and prosper. Together with Vice President Al Gore, he stopped at the Christopher Columbus middle school in Union City, N.J., to tout computers in schools, then plunged into Manhattan through the Lincoln Tunnel in a rare, time-saving trip in the same black armored Cadillac, with all the tubes closed to other traffic.
Hours later, with the help of celebrities like James Earl Jones, Kathleen Turner, Billy Baldwin and Lesley (no relation) Gore, the campaign raised more than $1 million for the re-election effort in a $1,000-a-plate gala at the Sheraton, and a lower-priced party at the Webster Hall nightclub sponsored by the nationwide network of young Clintonians known as the Saxophone Club.
In 1992, Mr. Clinton won New Jersey for the Democrats for the first time since 1964, and pulled just over 50 percent of the vote in New York, the only state besides Arkansas where he won a majority. This one-day whirlwind visit -- sandwiched between tours of flooded areas in the Pacific Northwest and Pennsylvania -- was a preseason twofer, proof that his campaign is leaving nothing to chance.
The President's remarks about Mr. Rohatyn were by far the most pointed anyone at the White House has yet made. By praising Mr. Rohatyn so strongly, Mr. Clinton seemed to imply at least mild criticism of the stringent tight-money policies of the current Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, whom the White House has acknowledged he intends to re-appoint.
But after the speech, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, took some pains to insist that Mr. Clinton had meant no criticism of either the chairman, or of the Federal Reserve Board's independent deliberations, and was only saying that "the Fed needs to take those pro-growth arguments into account."
The President's remarks were also clearly intended to appeal to Mr. Rohatyn's hometown crowd, and the ballroom was filled with prominent business and political figures from former Mayor David N. Dinkins to Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire chairman of Revlon, and his wife, Patricia Duff, who sat at Mr. Clinton's table.
Earlier, in his hotel suite, the President also met privately with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, and with black and Hispanic elected officials from around New York City, including State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx (a fellow client of Mr. Clinton's political strategist, Dick Morris).
In New Jersey, Mr. Clinton announced a plan to set aside $2 billion in Federal education funds over the next five years to help match state, local and private sector efforts to bring computers to schools.
"When I was young, I thought the future was there for every American who would work for it," Mr. Clinton told students, teachers and parents from Christopher Columbus, a gritty urban school in the heart of Union City where a pilot project in computer education sponsored by the Bell Atlantic Corporation has put test scores 10 points above the statewide average and sent attendance rates soaring.
"It turned out to be true for my generation. It will be true for this generation, too, and it will be a bigger, brighter, broader future, but only if we bring the benefits of the information revolution to every single one of them."
Harold M. Ickes, the New York labor lawyer and veteran Democratic campaign operative who is now a deputy White House chief of staff, said of the two-state visit, "We're not taking anything for granted."
Other campaign aides noted that Mr. Clinton has been in New York often in recent years, but usually to raise money or campaign for other Democrats like Mr. Dinkins or Mario M. Cuomo, and had not had a plain old-fashioned political chat with local Democrats for some time.
Mr. Ferrer said the meeting with Hispanic officials, which also included the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros, lasted about two hours, and covered a range of topics, from welfare reform to politics.
The event last night at Webster Hall -- a mecca for the hip and happening in the East Village where Madonna once paraded in her pajamas to promote her album "Bedtime Stories" -- was intended to appeal to younger supporters, who paid $150 to $250 to eat garlic shrimp, listen to a jazz band and cheer Mr. Clinton.
A saxophone was propped up onstage in case Mr. Clinton decided to reprise his musical performance from the Arsenio Hall show, but the President settled for a lot of hand-shaking and a call for younger voters to make their voices heard.
"This election is about you and your future," he said. "It's about what kind of America you're going to live in."
The scenic highlight of Mr. Clinton's visit came earlier in the day, when his motorcade decended from the heights of Union City into the Lincoln Tunnel. The route he used was by far the most direct into Manhattan, but a great rarity for Presidents, because the Secret Service and New York City police much prefer the isolated security of helicopters and the solitary splendor of the East River Drive. In this case, that method would have meant an hour-long trek through Newark International Airport to the Wall Street heliport.
Instead, Mr. Clinton was in his suite at the Sheraton New York in midtown within 15 minutes of leaving Union City, after a triumphal progression along West 42d Street and up the Avenue of the Americas to West 53d Street, as midday passersby milled behind block after block of blue-and-white police sawhorses. On 42d Street, the motorcade passed the cleaned up marquees of the former pornographic theaters that once lined the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
"It's been sort of v-chipped!" Mr. Ickes marveled of the street, referring to the device that can be installed in television sets to block violent programming and that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore support.

Democrats Unveil Schools Plan
 The Democratic leaders of the State Assembly proposed abolishing New York City's Board of Education, as well as its 32 community school boards. They called instead for a new board, most of whose members would be chosen in elections, and for a chancellor with broad powers and even greater independence from City Hall. [Page A1.]

New Victim of City Neglect

President Barnstorms Region
 The Clinton-Gore campaign and the men who head it came barnstorming into New York and New Jersey, showing off the information superhighway, shaking the money tree, touching political bases and generally raising their profile in two states vital to their re-election. [B1.]
 
Selling or Saving the Parks?
 To offset dwindling financial resources, the Parks Department has embarked on a new path: an aggressive pursuit of profit. In May, the department hired a marketing director to find money-making opportunities and corporate sponsors to finance recreational events in city parks in return for publicity. Parks advocates fear that the city is selling off its parks, piece by piece. [B1.]
 
Testing Boxers for H.I.V.
 Spurred by the case of Tommy Morrison, the former heavyweight champion who recently tested positive for H.I.V., New York has joined the handful of states that require boxers to be screened for H.I.V.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEBATE;
G.O.P. RIVALS CLASH OVER ATTACK ADS

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 15

 BODY:
In a nationally televised forum five days before Tuesday's primary, the Republican Presidential candidates quarreled over trade, health care and welfare tonight and vied for the title of most true conservative. But they spent much of their time attacking one another over attack advertisements.
The most vivid moment occurred when Senator Bob Dole, reaching over Representative Robert K. Dornan, handed Steve Forbes photographs of himself with his wife and dog. Mr. Dole called on Mr. Forbes to use more flattering photographs if he wanted to broadcast negative commercials. 
 "That's Elizabeth on the right," Mr. Dole said, handing over one picture. "And here's my little dog, Leader."
As Mr. Forbes, looking flustered, tried for a rebuttal, saying, "Senator, no pretty picture can get around. . . ." Mr. Dole cut him off sharply. "I know your problem," he said. "You have a lot of money. You want to buy this election. But this election is not for sale."
Beyond the personal jabs, the contenders repeatedly clashed over jobs and trade policies, themes that have marked the candidates' speeches here since the campaign shifted this week from Iowa.
The eight candidates, standing side by side at lecterns, appealed to voters' concerns about economic insecurity. Several challenged Patrick J. Buchanan's advocacy of trade restrictions. Senator Dole, for example, said that many of the high-tech jobs that have allowed much of New England to prosper had resulted from international trade agreements. And he said Mr. Buchanan was on "an isolationist kick."
But most notable about the 90-minute forum at WMUR studios here, carried live nationwide on CNN, was how the candidates jumped into the donnybrook over negative advertising.
The event descended into a free-for-all, with candidates cutting one another off and trying to put down their most threatening rivals. Mr. Buchanan took on Mr. Dole. Mr. Dole attacked Mr. Forbes and, to a lesser degree, President Clinton. Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee ignored Mr. Buchanan and aimed his fire at Mr. Dole. But Mr. Forbes went after Mr. Alexander, with whom he is vying to be considered the outsider in the race.
The forum turned negative almost immediately, when Mr. Alexander, seconds into his opening statement, sought to set himself apart by accusing Mr. Dole of running negative television commercials.
Turning to Senator Dole, the majority leader, Mr. Alexander said: "You're better than negative ads. Why don't you pull them?"
Mr. Dole shot back, telling Mr. Alexander, "I didn't know about negative advertising until I saw you do it against Pete Wilson." Indeed, Mr. Alexander ran negative commercials against Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who later withdrew from the race, in this state last year. Mr. Alexander did little negative advertising in Iowa.
Mr. Buchanan then took up the attack, scolding Mr. Dole for a new negative commercial that accuses him of extremism. Mr. Buchanan, a former commentator, also accused the Senator of mimicking his ideas even as he painted Mr. Buchanan as out of step with the mainstream of America.
"If I am an extremist, why are you pirating my ideas and parroting my rhetoric?" he asked. "Pat Buchanan is not an extremist." He also accused Mr. Dole of orchestrating a phone campaign against him.
Mr. Buchanan's frequent attacks prompted Mr. Dole at one point to turn to the former commentator and say: "Pat's really gotten carried away tonight. I don't know what happened. Did you have a bad day or something?"
Behind their endless volleys at Mr. Dole were efforts by Mr. Alexander and Mr. Buchanan to emerge as the Senator's chief competitor. Mr. Dole won a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses last week; Mr. Buchanan ran a close second, followed by Mr. Alexander.
In Iowa, rivals had accused Mr. Forbes, the publisher, of running a negative campaign. But Mr. Forbes was no longer the central target -- as he was in the last televised forum in Iowa -- because he has slid in the polls after finishing fourth in the caucuses. He said tonight that he regretted that "I spent too much time discussing my opponents."
Mr. Dole, the favorite target of Mr. Forbes's advertisements, interjected, "Too much money."
Tonight, Mr. Forbes, struggling for attention, tried to return to his message of "hope, growth and opportunity" and said he was the candidate running "to do something" rather than "to be something." He also sought to portray his controversial flat tax as only one element of his agenda. He said voters would be empowered by his proposals for medical savings accounts and the privatization of Social Security.
But it did not take long for Mr. Forbes to go on the attack, either. He went after Mr. Alexander, comparing his lucrative investment history with that of Hillary Rodham Clinton and implying that he had got a sweetheart deal. He said Mr. Alexander "turned one dollar into $620 million."
The longer shot contenders -- Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana; Alan Keyes, a former talk show host; Morry Taylor, a tire manufacturer, and Mr. Dornan -- chastised the leading candidates for not running more positive campaigns.
Mr. Dole tried to stay on a positive note, asserting: "I will be the next President of the United States. I'll be a good mainstream American President with a lot of good ideas about America's future."
The candidates talked so much about protecting markets that Mr. Keyes observed at one point that his opponents "sound like a bunch of socialists, not Republicans."
And Mr. Lugar said, "We will lose jobs if we go isolationist, protectionist."
The health care issue brought a sweeping reply from Mr. Dornan to exempt physicians from malpractice suits. "Take the lawyers out of it," he said.
Mr. Alexander offered two ideas, proposing greater flexibility in Medicare, moving "the decision-making and the money out of Washington."
Mr. Buchanan said people were losing their health care because of massive layoffs by corporations. "We've got to get those good-paying jobs back in the United States," he said, arguing that would bolster health care systems. "The eagle will soar," he said, moving the issue to his protectionist theme.
Mr. Dole said a pending bill would ease the problem by allowing for coverage of pre-existing health problems, insurance portability and a dozen other provisions. "We need to give tax credits to families with children," he added, so they can better provide their own health care.
On the matter of negative advertisements, which have been pervasive in New Hampshire this year, Mr. Forbes, who has broadcast the most negative commercials, said he thought it was "legitimate discussion for debate" when candidates like Senator Dole broke promises about not raising taxes.
Mr. Dornan, who voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, dealt with the protectionist question by denouncing the Mexican Government. "Mexico is in sad shape," he said. "The problem is corruption under one-party rule."
Mr. Forbes said he supported the trade agreement but blamed the Clinton Administration and the Mexican Government for not living up to Nafta.

Tallying Up the What Ifs in the Flat-Tax Proposals

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
A year ago, it is safe to say, not one American in 100 knew much about the flat tax. But after Steve Forbes spent tens of millions of dollars from his fortune espousing it endlessly in the Republican Presidential campaign, the flat tax has become fodder for talk radio and stand-up comedy.
And while Mr. Forbes, who will be pushing the idea in debates leading up to the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, is expected to fade from the picture, the concept has generated enough attention to make it likely to be kicking around for some time to come. 
But familiarity does not necessarily breed understanding. For what appears to be a straightforward modification of the Federal income tax in fact amounts to a radical revamping of the tax system. If adopted in anything like the form proposed by Mr. Forbes or another important advocate, the House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, it would be a change so sweeping that the consequences would be difficult, if not impossible, to predict.
It might well, as Mr. Forbes and his supporters say, be the key that unlocks an era of of lower tax rates, higher tax revenues and faster economic growth that eluded the Reagan Administration. Or it may, as many mainstream economists maintain, simply turn out to be a windfall for the richest Americans, making it even more difficult to tame the Federal budget deficit without hurting the poor and the middle class.
"This is uncharted territory," says Bill Gale, an economist at the middle-of-the-road Brookings Institution in Washington, "a no-man's land of possibility and wishful thinking."
The central appeal of the flat tax to ordinary Americans is the simplicity that would make it possible to reduce the tax form to the size of a postcard -- or to describe the tax system in a few paragraphs. The personal and corporate income taxes, with their multiple brackets, myriad deductions and ambiguous definitions would be abolished. In their place would be a tax on wages and other labor compensation collected from individuals and families, and a tax on the return to investment collected from businesses.
Under the Forbes plan, starting in 1998 a family of four would pay no tax on the first $36,000 of wages and pensions. The tax on labor compensation exceeding $36,000 would be 17 percent. (Comparing with present law, in 1994 -- the most recent year for which figures on tax liability are available -- the inflation-adjusted income level at which the flat tax would kick in is $31,750.) Representative Armey, who has offered a more fleshed-out proposal, would follow a slightly different pattern.
In both versions, the tax on investment income -- interest, dividends, capital gains -- would no longer be levied against households. But there would be no deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes, costly medical treatments or charitable contributions. And a range of employee benefits, from flexible spending accounts for child care expenses to company-paid health insurance, would no longer enjoy tax-favored status.
Businesses would pay the same flat tax rate on revenues, after subtracting outlays for wages (but not fringe benefits) along with other purchases -- everything from staples to warehouses to computers. But in figuring their taxes, corporations would no longer be able to deduct interest payments on debts.
Mr. Forbes, along with those economists who believe that taxes are a strong disincentive to work and saving, extol the greater efficiency of a flat tax. With a maximum tax rate on wages of 17 percent instead of the roughly 40 percent under current law and no household tax at all on investment income, flat-tax enthusiasts see a bonanza of enterprise, investment and economic growth.
The simplicity and transparency of the tax will appeal to corporate managers, who must now spend almost as much of their time worrying about the tax consequences of business decisions as they do about the nuts and bolts. But some businesses, notably those in mature, capital-intensive industries like autos and steel, may well end up paying more tax, while businesses that are growing will pay less. Note, too, that a flat tax would force a revolution in corporate finance, making it far more expensive to raise capital through loans or bond sales.
For most Americans, though, the immediate appeal is no doubt what they see in it for themselves. The struggling lower middle class may see redemption in a hefty standard deduction that frees it of all income tax liability. Middle-income Americans may focus on the low, flat rate that looks a lot better than the 28 percent tax rate most now pay on their last dollars of income. And the most successful Americans dream of a world without taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains.
It is not quite that simple, though. Most low-income Americans pay no Federal income taxes, anyway. And under Mr. Armey's proposal, they would no longer be eligible for the earned-income tax credit, a cash rebate from Uncle Sam that amounts to a negative income tax for the working poor. Mr. Forbes would preserve this tax credit, but he would have to pay for it with Federal spending cuts, higher flat tax rates or bigger budget deficits.
Middle-class Americans -- those with family incomes between, say, $40,000 and $100,000 -- presumably like the look of that 17 percent flat rate. But for many of them, the loss of deductions for mortgage interest, charity and local taxes could outweigh the benefits. Note, too, that employers would no longer be able to deduct outlays for medical insurance from their taxable revenues. Since economists generally assume that employers look at total compensation in setting wages, this tax would effectively fall on workers.
Then there are the wheels within the wheels. Neither Mr. Armey nor Mr. Forbes's tax plan would generate as much revenue as the income tax unless economic growth exploded. Shvetank Shah at Price Waterhouse's Economic Policy Consulting Service expects that it will take a 21 percent flat tax to sustain revenues if the earned-income tax credit is abandoned, as Mr. Armey advocates, and 23 percent if it is retained, as it is under Mr. Forbes's proposal.
While most taxpayers would enjoy a tax cut if the flat rate was set at 17 percent, those with the highest incomes would gain the most. And under a truly revenue-neutral flat tax, middle-income Americans earning less than $50,000 generally would do worse while those above that level would tend to do better. But differing individual circumstances -- mortgages, local taxes, contributions, investment income -- would determine individual outcomes.
By contrast, what the well-to-do see in the flat tax is pretty much what they would get. Lower tax rates on salaries combined with no personal tax on investment income, should mean higher after-tax income for nearly every rich family. Price Waterhouse estimates that a typical household with $250,000 in income would save 46 percent on its Federal income tax bill under a 23 percent flat-tax regime and even more if the rate was set at 17 percent.
But even here individual circumstances could prove decisive. Earning from investments would still be taxed at the corporate level. Some kinds of businesses would pay considerably more tax than they do today, some less. And since a tax on business is widely assumed to be a tax on the owners of the business, in some cases the gain from lighter taxation of affluent households, which hold most of the corporate assets, would be lost in heavier taxation of corporate revenues.
Also, while the focus has been on the flat tax's impact on after-tax income, wealth would be affected, too. Indeed, Lawrence Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University, thinks the indirect levy on existing wealth associated with higher business tax liability and the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would help offset the rich-get-richer features of the flat tax on earnings. Here, much depends on how the transition from the current system is handled -- in particular, what happens to the trillions of dollars in future deductions for capital depreciation that businesses have on the books for equipment already bought.
Many economists have long been intrigued by the simplicity, efficiency and intellectual elegance of the flat tax, particularly the way it would encourage investment and savings by eliminating the double taxation of corporate earnings at both the business and personal level.
But the attraction for voters may well be the notion of something for nothing. While some of the Republican candidates have nodded in the direction of a flatter tax system, several of them, including Lamar Alexander and Pat Buchanan, have already attacked Mr. Forbes's proposal, pointing out that any pure flat tax would further widen the gap between the rich and the middle class. And they note that Mr. Forbes's contention that nearly everybody would be better off under his plan relies on keeping the rate unsustainably low in hopes that a supercharged burst of economic growth would prevent the budget deficit from exploding.
If Mr. Forbes's star does not burn out soon, you can count on some of his opponents to step up their challenges to his claims.
"Once the romance ends," says Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan's Business School, "we'll find out what the flat tax looks like without makeup."
 The chart also misstated the effect of a 23 percent flat tax on a family with a $100,000 income. It would pay $750 more, not $700.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Suffer a 3d Day of Steep Losses

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell sharply for a third consecutive session yesterday, weighed down by talk of selling by large funds and by concerns that the supply of securities might be larger than the demand. Trading was choppy in a session that ended early ahead of the Washington's Birthday holiday weekend.
The sharp decline in prices came even though Government reports in the last two days showed that the economy was slowing at a more pronounced pace than had previously been thought. The indications of weakness that were found in reports on durable goods and factory orders on Thursday were echoed in reports yesterday on industrial production and construction spending. In the past, the bond market has often rallied on such reports, with their portents of continued mild inflation. 
 But analysts said they were not surprised that further evidence of a slowdown failed to bolster bond prices.
"You have to remember that the market has been bullish for a very long time, trading in a range of between 6 and 6.25 percent," said Ken McCarthy, the founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a market resarch firm. "A lot of optimism has already been built into prices, so it's going to take something else to take it out of its range."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell nearly a point, to 9624/32, driving its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, to 6.24 percent, from 6.16 percent on Thursday. The 30-year bond yield, a closely watched barometer for consumer interest rates, is now up sharply from 6.02 percent on Tuesday, and is at its highest since the Thanksgiving Day weekend.
The market opened yesterday to carry-over selling from Thursday, with additional losses tied to talk of more selling by some large hedge funds. Those reports raised investor concern that supply would outstrip demand. In addition, a large amount of new corporate and global issues with higher yields than comparable Treasury securities lured buyers away from Treasuries this week.
Traders said a brief comeback attempt, in the form of a short-covering rally, soon fizzled. Short-covering occurs when traders who have sold securities short -- that is, sold borrowed securities in hopes of a decline in price -- buy securities to cover their bet and reduce their exposure to loss should prices rise instead of fall.
Mr. McCarthy of Economic Intelligence noted that market participants were reluctant to hold long-term securities in advance of Congressional testimony next week by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Trading ended at 2 P.M. yesterday; the Treasury market will be closed on Monday in observance of Washington's Birthday.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said the economic reports released yesterday confirmed the market's view of a slowing economy. The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production fell six-tenths of 1 percent in January, the steepest decline since March 1991.
While the extent of the slowdown in January was clearly exaggerated by the blizzard that hit the East Coast early in the month, Mr. Fine said, "the fact remains that not all of the sales and production lost in January will be recouped."
The Commerce Department's report on construction spending in December also gave no hint of a pickup in economic growth, he said, since December's gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent simply reversed November's decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent. Also, October's gain was revised from a rise of 2.7 percent to one of only five-tenths of 1 percent.
Mr. Fine also pointed to the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which fell, he said, to 86.6, its lowest since November 1993. The index is released only to subscribers.
"All these statistics did nothing to alter the view that the Federal Open Market Committee is still leaning toward further accommodation," he said, referring to the Fed's policy-making panel.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Plunges, With Bad Weather Cited

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities took its biggest plunge in January since the nation was struggling to emerge from the last recession nearly five years ago, a Government report showed today. But bad weather was cited as a major factor.
The report provided further evidence that the economy slowed sharply in the first quarter. Many economists expect that the growth rate will be 1 percent or less for the first three months of the year. 
 The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production fell six-tenths of 1 percent in January, the steepest decline since output slid eight-tenths of 1 percent in March 1991, the final month of the 1990-91 recession.
Although the drop reflected continued weakness in the manufacturing sector, the central bank said it was aggravated by a blizzard that hit the East Coast in early January and forced the closing of many plants.
"The industrial production report is not a report about the economy," said Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Company International in New York. "It's a weather report."
But Jerry Jasinowski, an economist and president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that in addition to the severe weather, the report "reflects ongoing problems such as weak spending and clearly points to a poor first quarter."
The Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose nine-tenths of a percent in December, wiping out a similar loss a month earlier.
But spending on single-family housing fell for a second consecutive month.
While construction outlays for all of 1995 were up 4 percent, the advance was less than half the 9.1 percent increase the previous year.
Analysts did find a glimmer of hope in a second Commerce Department report today. It said business inventories in November edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent, the smallest increase since a similar rise in March 1994. The modest increase points to a possible pickup ahead in orders and production as businesses successfully clear their shelves and backlots.
At the same time, business sales rebounded seven-tenths of 1 percent in November after slipping three-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier.
The Fed also reported that the nation's industries were operating at 81.9 percent of capacity, down from 82.7 percent in December and the lowest since an 81.8 percent use rate in November 1993.
That portends continued moderate inflation, because the falling rate suggested a lack of production bottlenecks that could increase prices.
Factory output fell six-tenths of 1 percent, erasing a slight gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in December. Mining production slipped three-tenths of 1 percent on top of a fall of one-tenth of 1 percent in December. Output at the nation's utilities also fell, down nine-tenths of 1 percent after rising six-tenths of 1 percent. The increase caught many analysts offguard, since they were expecting a sizable gain because of increased power use during January's stormy weather.
In its construction spending report, the Commerce Department said outlays for residential, nonresidential and government projects totaled a record $537.5 billion annual rate, up from $532.9 billion in November, when spending dropped nine-tenths of 1 percent. Spending had risen half of 1 percent in October.
Residential spending rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in December, to a $241.2 billion rate, but the strength was in the multifamily sector. Single-family spending fell 1.2 percent on top of a six-tenths of 1 percent drop in November.
Multifamily spending, which is not as sensitive to interest rate changes as spending for single-family homes, jumped 11 percent in December, the second straight advance.
In its other report, the department said inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted $981 billion in November, up from $980.3 billion a month earlier. Manufacturing inventories were unchanged in November.

Hewlett's Shares Surge on Strength of Earnings Report

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company said today that its earnings spurted 31 percent in the latest quarter. The increase was far bigger than expected and sent the company's shares soaring nearly 10.5 percent on a day when the broad market fell back.
In the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, Hewlett-Packard earned $790 million, or $1.50 a share, up from $602 million, or $1.15 a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Analysts had been expecting about $1.35 a share. Revenues grew 27 percent, to $9.29 billion from $7.30 billion. The increases lifted the company's shares $9, to $95.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Analysts said the company's performance had been strong across all product lines, especially servers, which are computers shared by multiple users across a network, and printers, where Hewlett-Packard dominates the market. In nearly every category, the company's business units grew faster than their markets.
"They've got great momentum; they're really firing on all cylinders," said Stephen Smith, an analyst with Paine Webber. In addition to strong results in servers, printers and personal computers, "there has been a miraculous recovery in H.P.'s traditional business of test and measurement equipment" for electronics, he said. "This quarter it grew 30 percent; they've taken it from a mature business to a high-growth business," he added.
Hewlett-Packard said orders for the quarter rose 29 percent, to $10.1 billion. Domestic orders grew 24 percent, to $3.9 billion, while orders from outside the country climbed 32 percent, to $6.2 billion, representing 61 percent of the total.
"We're extremely pleased to start the year with these results," Lewis E. Platt, Hewlett-Packard's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement. "Very strong acceptance of our products, as well as outstanding growth in international markets, drove order and revenue increases that were ahead of our plan," he said. "Our businesses executed very well, and we strengthened our competitive position in key markets."
So consistently has Hewlett-Packard exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates each quarter that it runs the risk of seeing its stock drop should it simply meet expectations. Mr. Platt made a point of adding cautionary notes to his prepared statements and to a conference call with analysts.
"We're starting the second quarter in an excellent competitive position, but there are many challenges in the markets we serve," Mr. Platt said. "Competition remains intense; pricing pressures are persistent, and customer expectations continue to rise," he said. "In addition, there are signs of slowing in some major economies, including the United States and Western Europe."
Mr. Smith of Paine Webber said the company had increased profit margins in the quarter after seeing them drop in the fourth quarter of last year.

HEADLINE: On Riverside South, It's Time to Break Ground

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Feb. 15 photo of the rally for the proposed Riverside South complex on Manhattan's Upper West Side:
Several thousand union workers -- not the half-dozen shown -- gathered to support a project that will create 21,000 jobs, 5,700 units of housing (20 percent for low-income families) and 25 acres of open space and parks on the Hudson River. 
 Riverside South has been approved by New York City in a process upheld by the New York State Court of Appeals, leaving no further local obstacles to breaking ground. It has also been endorsed by a strong alliance of civic organizations, environmentalists and developers.
Representative Jerrold L. Nadler stands virtually alone in opposing a project that will start in a matter of months. Until he presents a plan to bring $4 billion of economic opportunity to the area this year, he should get out of the way and let us go to work.

HEADLINE: I Want My HDTV

BYLINE: By Richard E. Wiley; Richard E. Wiley, former chairman of the F.C.C., was head of its Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service. Now a Washington lawyer, he represents communications companies.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After an eight-year cooperative effort between the Government and industry, the United States leads the world in the development of digital high-definition television.
But Congressional concerns, arising in connection with enactment of the new telecommunications act, may derail the careful transition that the Federal Communications Commission has planned from our existing video system to the new technology. 
 HDTV will provide viewers with dazzlingly clear, wide-screen TV pictures and CD-like sound. But such a technical advance is not just about prettier TV. What beckons is a new era in which digital TV receivers, incorporating computer intelligence, will provide easy access to the information superhighway and its advanced digital services.
The United States' role in HDTV began in 1987 when the F.C.C. organized an industry advisory committee to help establish a new broadcast transmission standard (the existing standard was set in 1941). After reviewing numerous proposals, it determined that systems using digital transmission were superior to the older analog technology. It then urged the remaining proponents to switch to digital and ultimately merge into a single consortium.
After exhaustive testing, this system has now been recommended to the F.C.C. as the basis of a new national standard. It represents a tremendous advance in TV technology that will allow broadcasters to deliver not only HDTV but, in different times of the day, multiple lower resolution programs and data services. The system also works with computers and other imaging technologies.
To bring about digital TV, the F.C.C. has planned to lend a second channel to each TV station, employing frequencies reserved for broadcasters but unused because of signal interference. Fortunately, digital transmission will permit much more efficient use of this spectrum. The F.C.C. intends a gradual transition to the new service, enabling viewers to use their analog sets for a number of years. When the transition is completed, the existing channels would be returned to the Government for other uses.
Critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have raised a number of objections:
* That it represents a giveaway of valuable frequencies to broadcasters. But in reality it is only an exchange of one block for another, with the public getting a greatly enhanced service. Broadcasters would not be allowed to retain two channels permanently.
* That new legislation should require an auction of the HDTV spectrum. But this would disrupt the F.C.C.'s planned transition to digital broadcasting and likely lead to HDTV's development as a subscription service, offered only by cable and satellite. A better alternative is to auction the existing channels, which, when returned in a concentrated spectrum block, should be more valuable than the dispersed digital frequencies.
* That broadcasters should be given less than a full second channel. But the consortium system cannot be so divided, requiring the lengthy design and testing of an entirely new transmission system.
* That lower resolution digital TV is as good as HDTV. But hundreds of advisory committee experts did not agree, judging HDTV as a quantum leap forward.
Government leaders must determine where the public interest lies in this debate. But it is essential that they understand the technical, economic and social benefits in digital TV and its many spinoff services.

HEADLINE: New York 2020

BYLINE: By Robert R. Kiley; Robert R. Kiley is president of the New York City Partnership, an alliance of corporate executives.

 BODY:
It is the year 2020 and residents of the once vibrant New York region are stuck in apartments they cannot unload in crumbling urban centers. Suburbanites are faring no better. This is one bleak scenario presented in "A Region at Risk," a five-year study by the Regional Plan Association.
This picture cannot be dismissed: Too many of the region's core industries lost ground between 1982 and 1992. But there is far more reason to believe, as the association does, that long-term planning and a relatively modest investment will enable the region to retain its status as the global capital. 
 Boosterism? Hardly. No other region in the United States can match our muscle in financial and business services, in culture, tourism, information technology and fashion, despite some slippage in these industries.
Chicago is our nearest American rival in financial services, but not a close one. London may trade a greater volume of foreign currencies and Tokyo has larger banking assets, but neither has the diversity and the vitality of the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut region.
These capital cities have an advantage, however. Their national governments invest in them. Also, they are more resourceful in attracting private capital to maintain roads, subways and other infrastructure. Washington, however, treats New York as a stepchild. We send the Government billions ($18.9 billion in 1994) more in tax revenues than we get back in outlays. Washington's myopia need not be fatal -- if something is done starting now. One of the region's fundamental economic assets is its transit system. Our 1,250-mile rail network has enabled New York to attract and keep a highly skilled and increasingly mobile work force. But it was designed in the 19th century and needs to be updated for the 21st. Tokyo, Paris, London and Los Angeles are building or planning integrated regional rail systems; we have been at a standstill.
The association prescribes a $21 billion, 25-year transit plan. It recommends taking advantage of 25 miles of unused and underused rail segments to connect the region's far-flung systems. The Long Island Railroad, Metro-North, New Jersey Transit and New York City's subway system would be linked. Commuters from Teaneck, N.J., could get to Wall Street in 30 minutes; a trip from midtown to Kennedy Airport would take 29 minutes, and people who live in Laurelton, Queens, and Co-op City, in the Bronx, and who have no access to mass transit would be given service.
Twenty-one billion dollars is a huge amount, especially when the city, state and Federal governments are struggling to reduce budget gaps. But spread over 25 years, it is not daunting. In fact, taken together New York, New Jersey and Connecticut spend, in unproductive border warfare, about $1 billion a year providing tax incentives to attract businesses or keep them from moving next door.
Barring sudden enlightenment in Washington, the $21 billion would have to be raised locally. This should not be impossible. Paris built its $30 billion rail system by imposing a payroll tax. A gasoline tax of a few cents a gallon could raise the necessary capital here. Electronic toll collections on the East River bridges could generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The Hudson River bridges and tunnels could be transferred to an expanded Metropolitan Transportation Authority and subsidize its transit operations.
All of these approaches would require some sacrifice and must be debated. But the Regional Planning Association's report is the handwriting on the wall. Our political leaders and citizens should take heed.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Flight From South African Rand Helps to Push the Dollar Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Big sell orders sent the dollar lower against the Japanese yen and German mark yesterday in a drop accelerated by a flight from the South African rand linked to rumors that President Nelson Mandela had suffered a heart attack.
The rand was also hurt by talk that the South African central bank was about to relax remaining exchange controls, an action that might encourage investors to move capital out of the country. 
 Mr. Mandela appeared at a picture-taking session with President Sam Nujoma of Namibia and dismissed the rumors, but the rand lost much of the support that had been driving it higher lately.
"The popping of a speculative bubble in South Africa led to sharp dollar declines," said Tom O'Malley senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data.
Investors have recently been taking advantage of low interest rates in Japan and Switzerland to borrow yen and francs, then put the money in rand-denominated South African bonds paying about 14 percent.
With the rand falling, investors retreated to repay the borrowed yen and francs, lifting those currencies.
Lower American bond prices also helped pull the dollar lower.
Trading was thin ahead of the Washington's Birthday holiday in the United States and the New Year holiday on Monday and Tuesday in much of Asia. Also, a snowstorm in New York sent many traders home early, leaving the market vulnerable to a large order at 2 P.M. to sell dollars and buy marks.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 1.4535 marks, down from 1.4656 on Thursday. It finished at 105.20 yen, compared with 105.55 the day before. The dollar rose to 3.78 rand, from 3.6620 rand on Thursday. The British pound rose to $1.5520 from $1.5375.
The day began with hedge funds making huge sales of the dollar and large purchases of the yen; analysts estimated that one order alone involved $1 billion.
"The market was pretty nervous this morning" over the stockpiling of dollars that had occurred during the dollar's recent run-up, said Margaret Kudarauskas, another senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data.
As they had done with the rand, investors had been borrowing yen at extraordinarily low Japanese rates then buying dollars to invest in higher-yielding United States Treasury securities. But the dollar's recent rise made that strategy more risky and led many, including big hedge funds, to unwind their moves by selling dollars and buying yen.

HEADLINE: Fearing Reprisal, Publisher Drops Book on Greece

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Anastasia Karakasidou's first book, a 300-page study of ethnicity and identity in the northern Greek province of Macedonia, seemed poised for publication after surviving months of grueling academic review at Cambridge University Press and winning high praise from academic specialists for its insights and fairness.
But in December, Ms. Karakasidou received surprising news: The press had decided not to publish the book after all, it said, because it feared for the safety of its staff members in Greece. 
 Back home in Stony Brook, L.I., the Greek-born Ms. Karakasidou, an assistant professor of anthropology at Queens College, still sounds stunned. She had appreciated that her subject was a potentially provocative one -- Greeks bristle at suggestions that residents of that province consider themselves anything but true Greeks -- but she never expected this.
"They had my manuscript for more than a year and a half," she said in an interview this week. "I had no idea that this was happening, and I had no way of defending myself."
The immediate result of the Cambridge University Press's decision not to go ahead with the book, "Fields of Wheat, Rivers of Blood," was the outraged resignation of three of its academic advisers in anthropology, who charged the publisher, one of the most prestigious in the world, with violating the author's freedom of speech and caving in to a threat that was largely hypothetical.
But what in the old days might have remained a controlled protest by a small group of disgruntled academics has now expanded into a full-scale offensive, via the Internet.
Earlier this week, two of the three people who resigned as editorial advisers to Cambridge University Press -- Stephen Gudeman, a professor of anthropology at the University of Minnesota, and Michael Herzfeld, a professor of anthropology at Harvard -- sent a battle cry to colleagues around the world, calling for scholars not to submit manuscripts to Cambridge, or to review books for Cambridge. "By hindering the production and reviewing of new manuscripts," their message said, "we hope to demonstrate the academic world's collective dismay."
Although it is too early to gauge the effects of the Internet manifesto, it is clear that the word is getting out, fast, as E-mail messages zoom from campus to campus.
"It's gone out to thousands of anthropologists," said Mr. Herzfeld. "I think the historians are getting it as well."
At the University of Florida, Thomas Gallant, a professor of modern Greek and Balkan history, said he no longer wished to be published by Cambridge, even though he was about two-thirds finished writing a book for the publisher on the social history of modern Greece. "I am having legal counsel examine my contract because I think that ethically I cannot remain committed to the press," he said.
"Fields of Wheat, Hills of Blood" is a study of three villages in Macedonia, the Greek province, that asserts, among other things, that many of the residents speak Slavic dialects and consider themselves Slavo-Macedonian, not Greek. The findings challenge the official position of the Greek Government, which remains at odds with the neighboring Republic of Macedonia, a part of former Yugoslavia, and denies the existence of a Slavic ethnic minority within its own borders.
In the past, the Macedonian question has spurred nationalist-led violence in Greece. Ms. Karakasidou herself was threatened by right-wing groups two years ago after she published articles with conclusions similar to those in her book. But, she says, she continued to live in Greece without incident.
Ms. Karakasidou submitted her manuscript to Cambridge more than 18 months ago, sending it on a well-worn path of academic reviews and revisions. Finally, its reviewers deemed it ready to go, and Ms. Karakasidou, though she had no contract in hand, had every reason to assume that Cambridge would publish it.
"It is easily the most carefully researched and balanced assessment of the on-the-ground situation, from a historical and ethnographic perspective, that I have ever seen," Mr. Herzfeld said.
But a nervous Cambridge Press decided to seek advice about the potential for violence in Greece. Among other things, the publisher asked for an evaluation from the British Embassy in Athens, which sent a two-paragraph response saying no one at the Embassy had read the book, but that its subject was potentially controversial.
"It is impossible to judge the extent of a likely reaction, since so much depends on the political situation at the time of publication," said the letter, "but it could take the form of public criticism, protests and demonstrations, or violence or threat of violence against the author or publishers."
That was enough for the publisher, which has about five employees in Greece. In December, after consulting its 20-member ruling body, it decided not to proceed with the book.
Cambridge Press says it is unlikely to change its mind. "At no stage was there a contract signed or a commitment made," said Adrian du Plessis, the publisher's communications director. "Given the way we are established in Greece, it would be inappropriate for us to publish the book. It is not accurate to say that we banned it or censored it."
Some of the publisher's critics charge that Cambridge was also worried about local boycotts if the book went ahead. Cambridge has a lucrative market for English-language books in Greece, and administers English exams to hundreds of thousands of people each year.
Mr. du Plessis disputes this interpretation. "I've been involved in every discussion," he said, "and at every occasion I have never heard any economic motivation discussed. The issue was the risk to staff."
At the same time, the notion that the book was bound to spur violence has annoyed Greek scholars, who say that with the recent thawing in relations between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia, the possibility of reprisals has ebbed considerably.
"There really, really, was no tangible threat to the press, its personnel or its property," Mr. Gallant said.
One thing the publicity has done is to draw unexpected attention to Ms. Karakasidou at a relatively early point in her career. Several publishers have expressed interest, and this week the University of Chicago Press offered her a contract.
While Cambridge Press has been forced to defend itself against irate anthropologists, it is also even facing the wrath of some Greeks for its timidity.
Elias Gounaris, the Greek Ambassador to London, sent a scathing letter to the Guardian newspaper, defending his country's honor. "The worst possible fate that could befall a Cambridge University Press book on an anthropological subject in Greece would be indifference, spiced perhaps with the odd verbal attack against it in the column of some obscure extremist publication," the letter said.
"Intolerant voices do of course exist, as in most countries, but so far they have always dismally failed to silence anyone. In Greece at least."
