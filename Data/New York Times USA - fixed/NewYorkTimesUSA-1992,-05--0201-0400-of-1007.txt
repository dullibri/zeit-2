No There There

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
On a campaign trip to a South Carolina college campus 12 years ago, George Bush told his audience, "I'll be glad to reply to or dodge your questions, depending on what I think will help our election most."
At the time it was a throwaway line. In retrospect it sounds like something that should have been needlepointed on a pillow. Maybe that's unnecessary; the do-what-sells gene in George Bush's character seems so overdeveloped as to be ineradicable. 
 Last week, watching the President on the first day after the Rodney King verdict was like watching a man in sweatsocks negotiate a freshly waxed floor. Slip, slip, slide. Slip, slip, slide. He went from saying the jury system had worked to expressing shock at the verdict. You could picture him studying the polls and modifying the stance.
He finally gave a neat little speech, a generic speech with no real sense of what the most powerful leader in our nation was thinking and feeling at one of the most powerful moments in recent history. Instead of reaching deep inside himself for some anecdote about his own feelings on racism, he had a generic tale of black samaritans superimposed on a law and order riff. He announced a Federal investigation. He called up the Guard. He committed money.
That is government.
The difference between government and leadership is that leadership has a soul.
Supporters of Gov. Bill Clinton have asked over and over when those of us who crank out copy are going to bring character questions to bear upon George Bush. And by that they seem to mean questions about the President's personal life or about his son's business dealings.
But the truth is there is an enormous character issue here. The problem is that it is not true/false or multiple choice. It is an essay question.
What does Mr. Bush stand for?
His old friend C. Fred Chambers, an oil company executive, once said, "George understands that you have to do politically prudent things to get in a position to do what you want." Problem is, Mr. Bush has been in position for three years and we still don't know what he wants to do other than be politically prudent for seven more months so he can win re-election. It is the opposite of the emperor's new clothes. There are clothes, all right, depending on the prevailing winds, but nothing inside the empty suit.
Mr. Bush couldn't bring his great personal passions and ruling principles about race to bear on this crisis because he has none. Early this year The New York Review of Books ran a history of Mr. Bush's stands on civil rights issues that is a kind of road map of political expediency, from leading a campus drive at Yale for the United Negro College Fund in 1948, to campaigning for the Senate in Texas in 1964 by opposing the Civil Rights Act, to embracing a 1970 plan that advocated goals and timetables for hiring and promoting minorities, what the President today denigrates as quotas.
In fact he has done this on many of the great issues of our time. From the day in 1980 when the New York State Right to Life Party said that his presence on the ticket ruled out an endorsement for Ronald Reagan, to his position today as an anti-abortion ally -- but not a champion, never a champion, champion is risky, champion is out there -- Mr. Bush has slid from one politically convenient abortion stance to another.
My most enduring memories of the first Bush Administration will be of a man needing principle and having only polls. He waffled on raising taxes. He went from being part of an Administration that had propped up Saddam Hussein to dubbing Saddam a Hitler figure. He seemed at first flummoxed by how to react to the Soviet coup and then half-hearted in his support for economic aid, as though even the traditional Red Menace philosophy was too rich for his blood.
Trollope, who created fictional politicians the mirror image of real ones, wrote in his autobiography that a successful politician "must be able to confine himself and conform himself, to be satisfied with doing a little bit of a little thing at a time. . . . If he have grand ideas, he must keep them to himself, unless by chance he can work his way up to the top of the tree." But by that time a fellow may have gotten out of the habits of grand ideas and nonconformity. There is a character issue for Mr. Bush in this campaign. The clothes have no emperor. There is no there there.

Treasury Auction Well Received

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The first leg of the Treasury's $36 billion quarterly refunding auctions went well yesterday, as a $15 billion offering of new three-year notes was met with good demand.
The securities were sold at an average yield of 5.96 percent, up from an average yield of 5.54 percent at the last three-year note sale on Feb. 11. 
 The success of the debt sale, as well as fresh signs of economic weakness, helped to lift prices of outstanding Treasury securities, and interest rates fell slightly.
But traders said the firmer tone said little about today's 10-year note auction and the sale of 29 1/2-year bonds tomorrow. With important employment statistics not scheduled to be released until Friday, the outlook for these auctions is much more problematic, they said.
"The three-year was the easy one," one government bond trader noted. "The 10-year and the bond auction are entirely different stories, because there is a general nervousness in the market about the direction of long-term rates."
Prices were basically flat after results of the three-year auction were announced, but improved later on after auto makers reported mediocre car sales for the final 10 days of April and a closely watched survey of department and chain stores showed that retail sales fell in April.
At 6.1 million units, auto sales were a bit better than the anemic 5.5 million sold in mid-April. But for the entire month a meager 6.0 million vehicles were sold, a slight decline from March.
"The fascinating thing to me is that the auto companies are sounding much more optimistic than the selling rates suggest they should," said Ram Bhagavatula, chief financial economist at Citicorp Global Finance.
The survey of retailers was conducted by Johnson Redbook, and showed that the pace of sales growth slowed to 6.4 percent in April from 7.8 percent in March.
Analysts have been saying that consumers were unlikely to sustain the spending pace recorded in the first two months of the year. But yesterday they cautioned that the magnitude of any decline in April would be distorted by unseasonably cold weather that enveloped much of the country, as well as the earthquakes and riots that shook California.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 1/32 , up 7/32 , to yield 7.99 percent, compared with 8.01 percent late Monday.
Among outstanding note issues, the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 15/32 late yesterday, up 5/32 , to yield 6.76 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/32 , up 1/32 , to yield 5.25 percent.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the 10-year notes to be auctioned today were offered at a price to yield 7.49 percent.
Short-term Treasury bills edged lower.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.60 percent late yesterday, down 3 basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 3.75 percent.
Activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by a two-part, $430 million offering of high-yield securities for the MGM Grand Hotel Finance Corporation.
The first part consists of $200 million worth of seven-year first-mortgage notes. The 11.75 percent notes, which are noncallable for five years, were priced at $100, or par.
 
10-Year First-Mortgage Notes
 The remaining $230 million of securities were sold as 10-year first-mortgage notes. Noncallable for five years, the 12 percent notes were priced at $100.
Bear, Stearns & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting.
The securities are rated B-1 by Moody's Investors Service and B+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Southtrust Corporation, a bank holding company, offered $100 million worth of 12-year subordinated notes through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 8 5/8 percent notes were priced at $99.446, to yield 8.70 percent, 1.15 percentage points over the prevailing when-issued yield on the 10-year Treasury notes to be auctioned today.
The noncallable securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Denver City and County priced $315 million worth of airport system revenue bonds in a negotiated offering led by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
Yields on serial bonds offered range from 6.90 percent in 2000 to 7.20 percent in 2003.
The maximum yield on term bonds is 7.66 percent on securities maturing in 2025. Those bonds are callable in five years at a price of 102.
Interest on the securities sold is subject to Federal alternative minimum tax provisions.
Moody's has affixed a conditional rating of Baa-1 to the bonds. Standard & Poor's has a BBB rating on the securities.
Corporate bond traders said that prices of most investment-grade issues rose by about 1/8 point. Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt securities said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by a similar amount.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Accused Looters Are Varied As Greatly as Things Stolen

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 6

 BODY:
In hectic round-the-clock proceedings, thousands of men and women who were in the mobs that ravaged Los Angeles have crowded courthouses here, facing arraignments on charges of looting, arson, assault and curfew violations.
Some have long criminal records; some, in the parlance of their lawyers, are "virgins," never having broken the law before. All of them -- a fisherman, a sales clerk, a graphic designer, a homeless man -- are accused of discovering within themselves an impulse to anarchy when the city came apart.
 
Beginning With Anger
 That impulse took many forms, from angry gang members intent on settling scores to poor immigrant families unable to resist the lure of what one police officer called "the basic luxuries that we all take for granted." 
 In the tenements of South-Central Los Angeles, the looting began with a convulsion of anger at the acquittal last Wednesday of four white police officers in the beating of a black motorist, Rodney G. King. Today, the area's housing projects were sullen and tense, as word spread that stolen items were for sale even as the police were raiding houses to find the goods.
"A lot of people feel it's reparations; it's what already belongs to us," said Will M., a former gang member who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used. Regarding the destruction of many local businesses, he said, "A lot of people feel that in order to come together, we have to sacrifice the neighborhood."
Some critics said the authorities were themselves stretching the law by picking and choosing the people they arrested for curfew violations and by extending the deadline to arraign people already in custody. Tuesday night, Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law an emergency measure giving the courts seven days, rather than the usual two, to arraign those arrested in the riots.
Weary members of the district attorney's office said this evening that they had no idea of the number of cases processed today. By the close of business on Tuesday about 2,000 arrraignments had been completed, a spokesman for the district attorney's office said.
One police warehouse holding stolen goods seemed a veritable Smithsonian Institution of the modern American home, with a jumble of hardware, hoses, kitchen appliances, television sets, athletic shoes, diapers, dining room sets, panty hose, toys, auto supplies, rental videos, beer and popcorn.
In one crowded apartment building 75 percent of the tenants were found to possess looted goods and were swapping among themselves, trading television sets for toaster ovens, said Lieut. Rick Morton of the Los Angeles Police Department.
For the most part, he said, people stood by silently as the police removed the booty from their homes, speaking up to object only when officers reached for items that had belonged to them before the riots.
Their contrition -- or acquiescence, at least -- was in sharp contrast to the festival of greed that filled television screens last week as outnumbered police officers stood by while people loaded bags and shopping carts and station wagons.
Chaytor D. Mason, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, said that with the police scarcely in sight, the looters were able to indulge their inclinations, which are usually held in check. Only the fear of being caught has stopped them in the past, he said.
"The attitude here is: 'Here's my chance. There's no cops around,' " he said. "And the mob psychology of it is that people in anonymity in mobs will do things they would not ordinarily do because they think they can get away with it."
His observation echoed a common theme during the King trial, where defense lawyers argued that the police formed a fragile boundary between "society and chaos."
Though figures giving a racial breakdown of those arrested were not available yet, it was evident that most of those being arraigned over the past few days were poor people belonging to minority groups. Of the 1,628 people arrested by sheriff's deputies on various riot charges, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, 810 were black, 728 were Hispanic, 72 were white and 18 were listed as being of other races.
But Will M., the former gang member, said stereotypes could be wrong.
"You have to look at the people who didn't do it, like me," he said. "I could tell you about all the temptation that I felt. I could tell you about how many times I went to the door and had the temptation to go out. But I had to be a role model for my little brother."
In interviews at housing projects in Watts, where few businesses have returned since the riots and burning of 1965, it became clear that the most disadvantaged citizens of the city had once again failed to benefit from an economic windfall, though an illegal one.
Charles H. Drew, who runs an alcoholism program in the South-Central area said: "The very people who suffer the worst and get the least from society were the ones who got the least from the looting. If you live in the projects and you didn't have a car, you couldn't go across town and loot. And in their neighborhoods there's so little in the stores that after 10 people have been in there, there's nothing left to take."
Catalina Grier, 17 years old, struck a pose and showed off a tiny tube of lip gloss and a pocket-sized pack of Kleenex as part of her treasure. "I got on my new hair bands, my new house shoes and my new socks," she said.
Judge H. Dixon, owner of Watts Florist, said people were trundling shopping carts past his tiny shop all day Thursday, tossing him packets of salt pork and other souvenirs and calling out, "Ain't you going out with the boys and get something?"
Today, he said, the items were for sale: "Hey, Slim, you need an automatic car alarm? Hey, Slim, you need dog food?"
But for many young men here in the projects, anger rather than avarice seemed to be the motivation.
On Wednesday afternoon, as the verdicts in the beating of Mr. King were announced, said a young man who would identify himself only by his street nickname, J. B., "I was watching TV, and they were saying, 'Not guilty. Not guilty.'
"An hour later I saw these guys at Florence and Normandie beating up the guy in the truck. They're the ones that got it started off," he said. "I said, 'O.K., I'm down with that. If that's how they're going to do it, we're going to do it too.' "
As firefighters roved the area today, soaking the last smoking embers of more than 3,000 burned buildings, it was clear that the looters and arsonists had targeted businesses that they believed to be owned by outsiders, particularly by Koreans. They seemed to have mostly spared those that displayed signs or graffiti reading, "Black owned."
 
Rap Is Pointed To
 "Some of it was the rap groups," said Will M. "Certain rappers were already saying to burn the place down. They put the ideas in people's minds about burning stores down and coming together. A lot of gang members are not going to school; rap music is their school."
Mr. Dixon, from his vantage point at his flower shop, watched the rioting develop as young men from rival projects seemed to compete with one another.
"You could see as many as 8 to 12 of those mini-bicycles with these teen-agers pumping as hard as they could," he said. "If one in the group wants to hit a place, all the others join in, unless someone forceful in the group says: 'No, that's Slim's place. That's black-owned.' "
In the crisis atmosphere that now grips California, both houses of the State Legislature voted without a single dissent late Tuesday to extend to seven days from 48 hours, the period in which a suspect must be arraigned or released.
"It's illegal," said Melvyn Tennenbaum, a division chief in the downtown office of the Public Defenders. "You can't pass a law and then apply it to people after they've been arrested."
The public defenders struggling to match huge stacks of paperwork with defendants packed, standing, into holding pens, criticized the curfew law, which was in effect in Los Angeles and some nearby cities until Sunday night.
"The way the curfew is being applied is unconstitutional," said Greg P. Spano, a public defender. "It's been enforced in a discriminatory fashion." The overwhelming majority of people arrested for violating the dusk-to-dawn curfew were black and Hispanic, he said.
Members of the city attorney's office and the district attorney's office countered that extraordinary measures were needed at a moment of crisis.
But for many of those arrested, and their family members, the stance of the judicial system seemed another example of the inequities that had touched off the riot in the first place.
"He was just out getting some dog food, but it makes no difference now," said a 72-year-old retired California Highway Patrol officer who had spent the last two days trying without success to find his grandson in the Criminal Court building.

HEADLINE: PRESSURE BUILDING FOR AN AMENDMENT TO BALANCE BUDGET

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Momentum is building in Congress for a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced Federal budget and that could take effect as early as 1995.
Even those who say the idea is just a cynical effort concede that Congressional approval is almost inevitable this year, as lawmakers who have failed to control Federal spending rush to give the appearance of fiscal responsibility in an election year. 
 The balanced-budget movement, fueled by a coalition of conservatives and liberals who say amending the Constitution is the only way to control the runaway deficit, was the dream of the Reagan Administration and has President Bush's strong support.
 
Attacking a 'Bias'
 "This is an amendment the President has long sought," Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's budget director, told the House budget committee today.
"Years ago I would never have imagined that we would need, or that I would end up supporting, a balanced-budget constitutional amendment," Mr. Darman said. "But our political system has demonstrated a consistent, a systemic bias toward short-term political convenience."
Robert D. Reischauer, Congress's chief economist, cautioned, however, that an amendment alone could not do the job.
"In this election year, it would be a cruel hoax to suggest to the American public that one more procedural promise in the form of a constitutional amendment is going to get the job done," Mr. Reischauer told the committee. "The deficit cannot be brought down without making painful decisions."
 
Reasons for Action
 Lawmakers on both sides of the issue say support for an amendment has been propelled by widespread voter disaffection over Washington's handling of the economy and the deficit. In addition, voters are hearing analysts warn that foreigners are gaining undue influence over the American economy when they buy the bonds that are used to finance the growing national debt.
And increasingly the lawmakers say they perceive the Federal deficit, which is nearing $400 billion, as a long-term problem for the country's economic growth.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who is House majority leader, said Monday in a speech at Harvard University, that "in all likelihood" both houses would pass an amendment by the two-thirds majorities required by the Constitution.
Two versions of a balanced-budget amendment, one preferred by Democrats and the other by Republicans, are scheduled to reach the Senate floor early next month. The House is supposed to consider the issue soon afterward, and there could be months of difficult negotiations should the chambers pass different versions.
Senate Democrats are poised to try to block the Republican-inspired version, which would make it nearly impossible for future Congresses to raise taxes. They argue that tax increases should go along with spending cuts in reducing deficits.
The Democratic leaders say they wish they did not have to deal with such an amendment at all because it is both bad government and bad economic policy. But they concede they cannot force their will on the rank and file because the latter lawmakers are under so much election-year pressure to something about the economy.
 
Economists Are Divided
 Even if the amendment is not approved, it can hang over lawmakers' heads throughout this election year, making it difficult for them to talk in any constructive way about the economy and the growing deficit. State legislators would also be forced to address the issue.
Some economists say an amendment could help the economy, if it forces lawmakers to spend more judiciously, a move that they say could spur growth and investment by keeping interest rates low.
But other analysts worry that an amendment could hurt the economy by reducing the Government's flexibility to deal with unexpected problems like natural disasters or deep recessions. Some also worry that slashing spending or cutting taxes suddenly to reduce the deficit could precipitate a new recession.
If a balanced-budget amendment wins Congressional approval, it will then need ratification by three-quarters of the state legislatures, a process that proponents of the measure say will take about three years. Most of those supporters say enough states will approve, but the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other liberal groups have promised to fight the amendment.
It is also possible that further resistance could emerge once state lawmakers realize the amendment's potential impact on Federal spending in their jurisdictions.
Senator Bob Kasten, a Wisconsin Republican who is a sponsor of one of the Senate versions of the amendment, said some state lawmakers might initially fear that balanced-budget requirement would mean a reduction of Federal aid to their local governments. But, the Senator added, those lawmakers would eventually be persuaded that it was in their political interest to support it.
"There's an anti-Washington-spending feeling out there," Mr. Kasten said. "So I think legislators will jump on this as a political vote."
Critics of a balanced-budget amendment charge that its supporters are posturing as budget cutters for this election year while leaving the tough budget choices for future lawmakers.
"What people are looking for is a substitute for political will," said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts.
But Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, and Representative Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, insist that their respective versions of the amendment -- one in the Senate and the other in the House -- give Congress ample flexibility to govern.
 
Action in Time of War
 The Stenholm version would allow the requirement for a balanced budget to be waived after a declaration of war. The waiver would require only a majority vote in both houses.
The Simon version does not require a declaration of war but would allow lawmakers to waive the balanced-budget requirement by a simple majority vote in fiscal years during which "the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security."
The Simon and Stenholm versions also allow that in times of economic slowdown lawmakers could vote to lift the requirement if increased Federal spending was needed. In such cases, a 60 percent majority would be needed.
For each fiscal year, both versions would require the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress and would prohibit spending in excess of revenues unless 60 percent majorities in both houses voted to approve a deficit.
The Simon and Stenholm versions, which are very similiar and which have the most support in Congress, would go into effect in 1995, or the second year after enough states ratified the measure, whichever comes first.
 
The Republicans' Version
 The version proposed by Mr. Kasten and other Republicans would not only prohibit spending in excess of receipts unless Congress voted a 3-to-2 margin to permit it, but would also prohibit tax increases unless they were approved by a three-fifths majority of both houses. Mr. Kasten and other conservatives say the latter provision is needed to prevent liberals from exploiting the balanced-budget amendment as a cover to raise taxes.
A constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget has long been a goal of conservative politicians. It won 66 votes in the Senate in 1986, one short of the two-thirds needed. In 1990, it fell seven votes short in the House.
Prospects are better now, Republicans and Democrats say, because, absent the political will to make tough choices, the current system is insufficient to keep the deficit on a downward path.
With a few exceptions, the lawmakers who over the years have been most serious about trying to reduce the deficit either oppose the amendment or support it reluctantly. They believe that the main effect of approving a constitutional amendment would be to allow politicians to avoid the hard choices until the amendment took effect.
In an interview, Mr. Stenholm said Congress needed a constitutional provision mandating a balanced budget to stiffen its resolve.
"We're going to have to make these cuts either in an orderly way" or in the chaotic and the destabilizing fashion Argentina was forced to cut spending in recent years, Mr. Stenholm said. "We're not exempt."
 
Zeroing In on Tax Aspect
 Democratic Congressional leaders have decided to concentrate on stopping the tax restriction of the amendment, which they see as a threat to programs like Social Security. Some Republicans say they hope to attach the tax restriction to the Simon version.
Representative Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the Republican version of the amendment "would build in a constitutional block to the very decisions that need to be made" by practically preventing Congress from increasing taxes to balance the budget.
Passage of the anti-tax provision looks possible in the Senate, but is less likely in the House. It is possible that Democratic opposition could then stiffen enough to endanger the entire amendment, although most Democratsnow say the politics of the issue runs counter to that possibility.
Should the Republican version of the amendment pass one house but not the other, eventual enactment could be complicated if Democratic leaders appoint conferees to the Senate-House Conference committee that are hostile to it.
Democratic leaders in Congress are considering various strategies. In meetings last week, Mr. Panetta and Mr. Gephardt considered proposing legislation as a companion to the balanced-budget amendment that would impose severe cuts in military spending and in subsidies to corporations and ranchers, as well as cost-containment provisions to control the growth of Medicare and Medicaid, the Federal health care programs for the elderly and the poor.
They also considered altering the amendment to include one or more enforcement provisions like formulas to cap spending. Congressional officials said Democratic strategy meetings would probably continue in the Senate and the House until the amendment reaches the floor in both chambers next month.
Democratic strategists said they want members to face up to the sacrifices they are asking future lawmakers to make, and, as one aide put it, "expose the hypocrisy a little bit."

HEADLINE: At Site of 'Iron Curtain' Speech, Gorbachev Buries the Cold War

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FULTON, Mo., May 6

 BODY:
History came full cycle today as Mikhail S. Gorbachev added a postscript of global reconciliation to the "Iron Curtain" speech by Winston Churchill here 46 years ago, but pointedly contended that the United States was the "initiator" of the nuclear arms race.
Speaking at Westminster College, the scene of Churchill's warning in 1946 about Soviet imperialism, the former Soviet leader conceded that the Kremlin made a "major error" in assuming that the defeat of fascism in World War II would produce an inevitable triumph of Communism. 
 But he argued that the United States and other Western nations erred grievously in failing to realize that Stalin and the Soviet people were too exhausted from the war to indulge in military aggression against the West.
"By including the 'nuclear component' in world politics, and on this basis unleashing a monstrous arms race -- and here the initiator was the United States, the West -- 'defense sufficiency was exceeded,' as the lawyers say," Mr. Gorbachev declared. "This was a fateful error." [Excerpts, page A14.]
Speaking as the last President of the now-defunct Soviet Union and the Kremlin chief who led the world back from nuclear confrontation, Mr. Gorbachev spent much of his speech looking ahead to a better world strengthened through his prescriptions for a stronger United Nations.
But he also presented a blunt critique of some cherished American underpinnings of the cold war and warned against "the intellectual, and consequently political error, of interpreting victory in the cold war narrowly as a victory for oneself."
Rather than a lopsided victory, Mr. Gorbachev described the end of the cold war as "a shattering of the vicious circle into which we had driven ourselves."
"This was altogether a victory for common sense, reason, democracy, and common human values," he said.
Examining the roots of the cold war, Mr. Gorbachev cited a critical Soviet error in Stalin's inability to grasp postwar politics. But he contended that "the West, and the United States in particular, also committed an error."
"Its conclusion about the probability of open Soviet military aggression was unrealistic and dangerous," he said, differing with the basis of the West's collective defensive strategy of the postwar decades.
"This could never have happened, not only because Stalin, as in 1939-41, was afraid of war, did not want war, and never would have engaged in a major war," he contended. "but primarily because the country was exhausted and destroyed."
Visiting, like Churchill, as a politician rebuffed at home yet outspoken in retirement -- the British leader was ousted in the 1945 election by Clement Attlee and the Labor Party -- Mr. Gorbachev spoke to an outdoor gathering and offered a range of proposals for strengthening the United Nations. These included the enlargement of the Security Council and the application of stronger sanctions and military force against wayward members.
But the audience, watching him on a sunny day in a simple American heartland setting, was clearly more interested in his pronouncements on the end of the cold war. In this, Mr. Gorbachev was reflective and recanted a bit on his own views.
"Having long been orthodox Marxists, we were sure we knew," he said. "But life once again refuted those who claimed to be know-it-alls and messiahs."
 
A 'Watershed' Moment
 Mr. Gorbachev's speech was titled "The River of Time and the Imperative of Action," an allusion to his sense that a "watershed" moment had arrived, comparable in its way to the 1946 moment and its need for concerted action. He was repeatedly applauded, particularly in hailing the world's retreat from the abyss, urging global efforts to protect the environment and warning against triumphalist claims of cold war victory.
The Missouri countryside glistened, with a cluster of cold war nuclear-missile silos hundreds of miles to the west all but forgotten. Mr. Gorbachev obviously enjoyed the day, offering Churchill's V-for-victory signal to pleading photographers and giving thanks for a lunch of baked ham and potato salad provided by the administrators of the 140-year-old liberal arts college of 750 undergradutates.
It was the college, which gained international visibility after the famous 1946 speech, that invited him to speak today. Mr. Gorbachev, as in earlier addresses, warned against the excesses of nationalism reawakened at the end of the cold war, as well as against a "monocentric" view of post-cold-war politics. In that view, one dominant nation, the United States, might prevail over a "multipolar" political world.
The former Soviet leader was cheered as he arrived in the sunshine at the speaking platform set before a sculpture by Edwina Sandys, Churchill's granddaughter, celebrating the fall of the Berlin wall.
He came as a pensioned politician looking for a foothold in the West on a fund-raising tour for his new Gorbachev Foundation. He spoke gratis and beamed and touched his chest to demonstrate his gratitude, as a crowd estimated at 10,000 applauded the college's award to him of an honoray doctorate of laws.
 
Stronger U.N. Urged
 The mood in Fulton was serene, in severe contrast to the ominous one conjured up here on March 5, 1946 by Churchill.
"A shadow has fallen upon the scenes so lately lighted by the Allied victory," the British wartime leader said. "From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent."
Today, Mr. Gorbachev stood in the Missouri sunshine to proclaim an end to Churchill's alarm, but also to press for a greatly strengthened United Nations to deal with the complicated post-Soviet world.
In particular, he called for creation of a "special body" to use economic and military means to prevent regional conflicts and for a greatly enlarged Security Council, with nations like India, Japan, Poland, Mexico, Germany, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia and Egypt as members, even if without veto power.
Churchill had declared, "Nobody knows what Soviet Russia and its Communist international organization intends to do in the immediate future, or what are the limits, if any, to their expansive and proselytizing tendencies."
Today, Mr. Gorbachev stood at the same lectern as Churchill to symbolize the Soviet Union's peaceful demise and to look no less uncertainly into the future, hoping this time that nations "made wise by bitter experience" might cast aside "egoistic considerations in order to arrive at the exalted goal that is man's destiny on earth."

HEADLINE: BUSH LIKELY TO GO TO ECOLOGY TALKS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Ending one of the more fractious debates within his Administration in recent months, President Bush is expected to announce soon that he will fly to Brazil for a United Nations environmental conference that his conservative advisers call a trap and his economic experts see as a fiscal debacle.
The prospect of that announcement is likely to cheer a worldwide alliance of environmental advocates and political figures involved in environmental issues, who have long feared that Mr. Bush might single-handedly wreck the meeting simply by staying home. 
 Environmentalists have resorted to advertising on national television to press Mr. Bush to attend, and the issue loomed as an important factor in the presidential campaign.
 
World's Biggest Polluter
 As the world's largest industrial economy and its largest energy user, the United States is both the Earth's most prolific polluter and far and away its prime source of clean-up technology and money, and thus is regarded as indispensable to the meeting, which convenes in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Some of the same environmentalists pressing the President to attend, however, now complain that Mr. Bush's own hardball negotiating tactics may make the conference more a symbolic triumph than a substantive success. The President has dangled the threat of a boycott while seeking major concessions on environmental agreements to be signed in Rio.
"It would be hard to imagine a more important event for the future of the global environment than this one," James Gustave Speth, president of the Washington-based World Resources Institute, said in an interview. "And so it's been one of the most discouraging experiences of my 10 years of working on international environmental issues to see my Government fail to give the kind of leadership that it gave 20 years ago."
Mr. Bush has yet to declare his intention to attend the Brazilian meeting, although White House officials have said for some weeks now that a decision was close. But several Administration officials, who refused to be named, said in interviews this week that Mr. Bush almost certainly will attend the meeting, although his stay may be brief.
Mr. Bush's aides insist that the United States has been a leader in negotiations leading up to the meeting by resisting treaties that would dictate rigid goals and methods for reducing global pollution; at the same time, it has advocated the sorts of free-market environmental strategies that the Administration has tried to push at home.
"My sense is that he will attend," said one Administration official at the center of the debate. "The President has nothing to be ashamed of -- we've got a good environmental record -- and we've told him he ought to make the case for the good methods of achieving these goals rather than the command-and-control methods they've been talking about."
The meeting, formally called the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, will be attended by at least 100 world leaders, including most Western leaders, and 6,000 experts on the global environment. Its centerpieces, now being negotiated, are a worldwide agreement to slow the production of chemicals that have accelerated the warming of the Earth's atmosphere and a second agreement on means to preserve plants and animal species.
Mr. Bush has repeatedly voiced great skepticism about the conference. For most of this year, while his aides haggled over the fine points of treaties and declarations, he has publicly fretted that the conference would become a soapbox for poor nations to demand billions in environmental technology and cash that the White House neither has nor intends to pledge.
Some aides also expressed alarm that the conference would commit the United States to actions intended to avert global warming, like reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide, that would cripple major industries at a time of fragile economic growth.
"I am not going to go to the Rio conference and make a bad deal or be a party to a bad deal. I'm not going to sign an agreement that does not protect the environment, and the economy of this country," the President told business executives last month.
But he is apparently going anyway, in no small part because a curious alliance of political advisers and policy experts has convinced him that he cannot afford to stay home.
That alliance includes his campaign manager, Robert M. Teeter; his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft; senior officials at the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.
It also features a rising young official at the Office of Management and Budget, Robert Grady, who was the architect of not only Mr. Bush's environmental policy but his use of pollution in Boston harbor as a campaign issue in the 1988 presidential election.
That group is bound by an array of interests. State Department diplomats and Mr. Scowcroft are said to believe that Mr. Bush's absence would be an abdication of global leadership, since most major leaders will be at the conference and strongly support its goals. The meeting also bears potentially huge political implications for Mr. Bush. Aides believe that his failure to attend would blot his environmental record at a time when the issue has become a major factor in the votes of young people and in some large states, like California and Florida. His absence would weaken his ability to attack his likely opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, whose environmental record has also been criticized.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
As Los Angeles Smoke Lifts, Bush Can See Kemp Clearly

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Suddenly, everyone wants to talk to the Housing Secretary, Jack F. Kemp. Members of Congress do. Television networks do. And what is most important, President Bush does, summoning him to three Cabinet meetings in three days and saving him a seat on today's plane ride to Los Angeles.
"It's nice to be needed," Mr. Kemp said in an interview today. 
 Most likely it is an uncommon feeling.
Beset by the accusation after the Los Angeles riots that the Bush Administration has let the problems of urban America fester, the White House has now reached out to Mr. Kemp, declared renewed interest in his proposals for a conservatives' war on poverty, and stepped up attacks on Congressional Democrats for not enacting them. Today, as he left for California, President Bush said the nation could "do better" than the Great Society programs. [Page A22.]
 
The Things Not Said
 What the White House has left unstated is that Mr. Kemp's moment in the sun comes after three years of a kind of internal exile.
Suspect for his enthusiasm for anti-poverty plans, the head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development has been shut out of the President's inner circle, ridiculed by the budget director and sent to fight lonely battles on Capitol Hill without White House reinforcements.
While the White House says Mr. Kemp's place in the Administration shows that it has had an urban policy all along, Mr. Kemp's admirers on both sides of the aisle say it shows the opposite.
"It's terrible that Jack has been relegated to a back seat up to now," said Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, one of Mr. Kemp's Republican allies in Congress.
Asked if the Administration has accomplished anything in anti-poverty policy, Mr. Weber said, "Not really."
 
The Critic Within
 That sentiment was shared by Stuart Butler, vice president for domestic policy at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington research organization. "Kemp is now being brought out and put on the talk shows, but when Kemp wanted to fight for his programs on the Hill, the White House was nowhere to be seen," Mr. Butler said.
Indeed, those looking for a vocal critic of Administration inaction need look no further than Mr. Kemp himself.
His confidential correspondence with White House advisers over the past two years, provided to a reporter without permission last year by someone outside his office, reads like the pleadings of an outside advocate.
In a letter dated May 1990 to the Domestic Policy Council, which was reviewing options for an anti-poverty effort, Mr. Kemp warned that the problems of urban America had reached "a moment of critical mass." He said it was "past time for the Administration to aggressively highlight a new comprehensive anti-poverty agenda."
White House aides then drafted a potential strategy for the President that made Mr. Kemp wince. "That's not a vision," he wrote back in July 1990, accusing them of "bureaucratizing the effort and sending it to oblivion."
He was particularly vexed at their plans to conduct technical studies of the way anti-poverty programs are financed and managed.
The White House was already criticized for "studying the problem to death and throwing up its hands," Mr. Kemp wrote. "Meanwhile, what's going on in our neighborhoods and on our streets?"
Part of what has set Mr. Kemp off from his Administration rivals is his view that the Republican Party can benefit politically from an anti-poverty effort, especially by attracting more minorities to the party. Few people in the Administration have spoken as crudely as Patrick J. Buchanan, the Republican Presidential challenger, who said Mr. Kemp has "gone native." But many others have doubted in private that there is any political profit in his plans.
 
Pluses, Minuses and Poverty
 In their 1990 planning document, White House aides addressed the political calculus of an anti-poverty effort backed fully by the President.
On the plus side, they said it "takes the moral high ground." On the down side, they warned, the effort could give poverty "greater visibility," and bring new pressure to "increase spending and demonstrate concrete success."
Mr. Kemp wrote back in a complaining tone that "poverty already has a high public visibility."
While a year ago Mr. Kemp was coming as close as he could to criticizing a President, arguing that "all of us need to do more," he is now being careful not to pick fights.
Asked today if aides like Richard G. Darman, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, had slowed his efforts, Mr. Kemp replied in a virtual whisper: "Are you crazy? You're trying to get me into an internecine warfare on the night I'm going out with the President to help implement these ideas."
 
A 'Cynical' Question?
 In interviews three times this week, Mr. Kemp was asked to specify what Mr. Bush has accomplished for urban America. First he called the question "cynical" and said, "I don't want to even answer that."
Next he made a joke, arguing "with tongue planted firmly in cheek," that Mr. Bush had had the good sense to make him the Housing Secretary.
Asked a third time, he lashed out at Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Mr. Bush's likely Democratic challenger.
Mr. Kemp's ideas themselves are part of what he likes to call "empowerment," a strategy to circumvent Government bureaucracies and use market forces to accomplish social ends.
He is most vocal about three policies in particular: those that will give tenants in public housing the chance to buy their units; those that will let parents choose the schools their children attend, public or private, and those that would give tax breaks to business that locate within inner-city "enterprise zones."
 
More Money Wanted
 Congress has given Mr. Kemp less money than he wants for the first program, and nothing for the others -- a situation the White House has been quick to highlight, in arguing that Democrats cling to failed, outdated policies.
While the White House set off a furor this week in criticizing the social policies of the 1960's, few seem to realize that Mr. Kemp's plans in some ways are quite similar.
Mr. Kemp's housing proposals include heavy doses of social services like job training and anti-drug counseling. More pointedly, Mr. Kemp's enthusiams for community organizing bears a striking, if unconscious, resemblance to the War on Poverty.
It is more than mere coincidence that anti-poverty planners in both the 1960's and 1990's used the same term: "empowerment."
 
What Impact on Policy?
 While Mr. Kemp has captured the limelight, it remains unclear whether he has gained a permanent upper hand in policymaking.
Mr. Kemp said this week's Cabinet debate was taking familiar turns between those who want to move fast on his proposals and those who counseled caution, when the President brought the discussion to "a screeching halt" by backing his agenda to the fullest. Mr. Kemp said that to divulge more might pre-empt the President's speech in Los Angeles.
But speaking to a group of foreign journalists Tuesday, Mr. Kemp himself said the "jury is out" on the long-term prospects of his plans, which are outlined in this year's budget.
He described himself as a strong supporter of President Bush, "very much a believer in him and his leadership." But he added, "If he were to turn his back on his own budget, I guess I'd have no reason to stay."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
BUSH SAYS LARGESS WON'T HELP CITIES

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
President Bush, whose Administration on Monday blamed failed Democratic social-welfare policies of the 1960's for the Los Angeles riots, said today as he left for California that this was no time for name-calling.
But he also contended that the nation could "do better" than Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society programs in combating urban ills, and he said that "it is far more important to give people a piece of the action than simply to have the Federal Government dump largess on them." 
 Government spending "has not solved many of the fundamental problems that plague our cities," the President declared this afternoon. "We need an honest, open national discussion about family, about values, about public policy and about race."
[Mr. Bush arrived in Los Angeles Wednesday night, assuring the city's residents that his Administration was already taking steps to help rebuild the city. "The Federal Government is committed to help this city, to help this city rebuild," he said in a statement delivered at the airport after he stepped off Air Force One.]
 
'A Do-Nothing Approach'
 In North Carolina, where he won one of three primary victories on Tuesday, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the almost certain Democratic Presidential nominee, said he approved of Mr. Bush's trip to Los Angeles because people in the riot area "need a President." But later, campaigning in Beckley, W. Va., Mr. Clinton returned the President's fire.
"We can do better than the Great Society, but now we're doing nothing, so we're doing worse than the Great Society," he said. "We need things that will let people at the local level shape their future in everything from houses to jobs to safe streets. But we can't do better with a do-nothing approach."
Other Democrats defended the anti-poverty campaigns of a quarter-century ago with greater vehemence.
Joseph A. Califano Jr., a key domestic policy adviser in the Johnson White House, said poverty had declined under the Democrats, then had risen again under the Republicans.
 
'An Untruth, a Lie'
 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said the contention by Attorney General William P. Barr that the breakdown of family structure had been caused by the Great Society was "one of the most depraved statements I have ever heard from an American official." The statement, he said on the Senate floor, "is an untruth, a lie."
Mr. Bush said about half the 1,000 Federal law-enforcement specialists who were sent to Los Angeles last week had been withdrawn, and predicted that troops still on duty there "won't be much longer."
He has planned a tour of the burnt-out portions of South-Central Los Angeles and a meeting with Gov. Pete Wilson of California before returning to Washington on Friday evening.
Neither the President nor Mr. Clinton has looked terribly sure-footed in their early reactions to the acquittal of four white Los Angeles police officers charged with beating a black motorist, Rodney G. King, and the widespread arson and looting that followed. Each has seemed to be groping for solid footing in uncertain political terrain.
Marlin Fitzwater, the President's press secretary, began open political combat on the issues of racial tensions and urban breakdown on Monday when he said the riots were the result of Democratic policies. Senior Republican strategists, including officials of the President's campaign committee, laughed at him; one Republican Senator said that "next Marlin will blame the savings-and-loan crisis on Woodrow Wilson."
On Tuesday, Mr. Fitzwater pulled back from his remarks, but they suggested, and Mr. Bush in effect confirmed today, that the Republicans think they have found the formula they need to escape blame for the riots.
 
Vindication, Perhaps
 In a speech last year at the University of Michigan, the President criticized social-welfare programs originally enacted by the Democrats. He said then that "programs designed to insure racial harmony generated animosity," and "programs intended to help people out of poverty invited dependency."
Although he repeatedly denied during an impromptu news conference this morning that he was assigning blame for racial polarization, he told reporters, "If I said a year ago that these programs weren't working, perhaps I have been vindicated."
But he conceded that he could not "certify to the American people that we have tried the new ideas that might make urban America better."
The President has never said which programs he considered to be failures, but he has emphasized in his own Administration at least one of the Johnson-era programs, Head Start, which seeks to compensate for poverty by using special educational techniques with young children.
In remarks to the American Newspaper Publishers Association convention in New York, to which he spoke on television by a television hookup, Mr. Bush said: "I think we should certainly reconsider the status quo in terms of Federal aid to cities. I think we would all agree that it hasn't worked in the last 10 years, hasn't worked in the last 30."

Woolworth Reports a Profit

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Woolworth Corporation said yesterday that it earned $17 million in the first quarter, in contrast to a loss of $100 million a year earlier.
The retailer said its operating earnings, which reflect the health of its ongoing business, were up 20 percent in the quarter ended April 25. 
 Woolworth said its profit amounted to 13 cents a share. The company posted the $100 million loss in the first quarter of 1991 when it took a $113 million one-time charge for a change in accounting for post-retirement benefits.
Woolworth reported operating income of $59 million, up from $49 million a year earlier.
Revenue fell 1.5 percent, to just under $2.1 billion, from $2.13 billion, in part reflecting the planned closing of about 900 specialty and general merchandise stores.
Woolworth, hit hard by the recession in the United States and Canada, had uneven sales in the first quarter, which is generally the least significant period for retailers.
Woolworth's stock fell 62.5 cents yesterday, to $29.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: The Three Main Proposals For a Budget Amendment

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
For members of Congress who want to balance the Federal budget, there are currently three main proposals to amend the Constitution.
The amendment sponsored by Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, and a similar proposal by Representative Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, have wide backing in Congress and are given a good chance of passing this year. A competing version, whose chief sponsor is Senator Bob Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin, has less support in Congress and would erect greater obstacles to increasing taxes than the other proposals. 
 Here are the three versions:
 
The Simon Plan
 The amendment would require that total outlays not exceed total receipts for any fiscal year. The amendment, which would take effect beginning with the second fiscal year after its ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures, would allow outlays to exceed receipts if 60 percent of all members of the Senate and the House approve it in a roll-call vote.
Taxes could be increased only if half of both the full House and Senate approve. The requirement for a balanced budget could be waived, by majority vote, for any fiscal year when the United States is engaged in a military conflict, whether or not it is officially declared a war.
 
The Stenholm Plan
 The amendment is generally the same as Mr. Simon's except that it would first require the President and Congress to agree on an estimate of total receipts for each fiscal year by enacting a law devoted to that subject. Outlays could not exceed the level of estimated receipts without approval of 60 percent of all the members of each house of Congress.
It would take effect in fiscal year 1995 or with the second fiscal year beginning after its ratification, whichever is later.
In addition, the limit on the debt of the United States shall not be increased unless 60 percent of all members of both houses of Congress approve.
It would allow the requirement for a balanced budget to be waived if war is declared.
 
The Kasten Plan
 Like Mr. Simon's version, Mr. Kasten's amendment would require total actual outlays and receipts to be balanced and would allow outlays to exceed receipts only if 60 percent of all the members of both chambers approve.
The major difference in the two versions is that Mr. Kasten's amendment would allow taxes to be raised at a rate greater than the rate of increase in nation's economic output only if 60 percent of all the members of both house of Congress approve.
It would allow the requirement for a balanced budgetto be waived if war is declared.
It would take effect in the fiscal year 1997 or the second fiscal year beginning after its ratification, whichever is later.
Like the Stenholm plan, Mr. Kasten's version would not allow the debt limit to increased unless 60 percent of all members of both houses of Congress approve.

HEADLINE: North Korea Reveals More About Its Nuclear Sites

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 6

 BODY:
Possibly resolving one of the biggest mysteries surrounding its secretive nuclear program, North Korea has described a web of previously unknown sites to the International Atomic Energy Agency, including a laboratory that appears to be the same building the United States asserts is the centerpiece of a nuclear-weapons project.
The agency said that in the detailed, 100-page document submitted on Monday, North Korea described a "radiochemical laboratory" designed for research on separating very small amounts of uranium and plutonium as a way to control nuclear wastes. 
 Though the true nature of the laboratory will not be known until inspectors arrive at the site -- a process that may begin as early as later this month -- experts say that it appears to be the same building that American intelligence agencies have described in far more sinister terms.
 
U.S. Calls It Deception
 Citing satellite photographs, the United States has alleged that the building at Yongbyon, about 60 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang, is a nearly completed plutonium reprocessing center, capable of producing large volumes of weapons-grade plutonium that could be fabricated into crude nuclear weapons.
North Korea has denied any such reprocessing center exists and said that all of its nuclear sites are for civilian purposes. Nonetheless, it has held off inspections for more than six years. Only in recent months, under strong political and economic pressure from the United States and Japan, has it begun to reverse course. Today officials of the nuclear agency said they were taken aback at the level of detail provided by North Korean authorities.
"The facilities listed were more than they needed to give us," David Kyd, a spokesman for the agency, said in a telephone interview from Vienna. "Our inspectors will go in by the end of the month, so things are beginning to roll."
He said a full report on the centers would be made to the agency's board of governors when it meets in Vienna in mid-June.
Assuming that the North Korean and American officials are talking about the same building, something that will not be certain until inspectors arrive, it raises a critical question: Did American intelligence services badly misjudge North Korea's capabilities and intentions, or is North Korea vastly understating what it has built?
If the North Koreans are telling the truth, it would be a major embarrassment for the Bush Administration, which has organized enormous international pressure again the Communist Government of Kim Il Sung to stop the North Korean bomb program. But American officials have repeatedly warned in recent weeks that it is still possible that North Korea is engaged in an elaborate deception, similar to Iraq's efforts to hide the scope of its nuclear weapons project.
 
Tokyo's Aid Stance
 It is unclear, for example, why North Korea would need what appears in satellite photographs to be a huge building to house a small research laboratory. One possibility is that production equipment has been removed in recent months to make the building's contents, which cannot be seen by satellite, appear innocuous. Another possibility is that North Korea determined that the technology of reprocessing was beyond its technological capabilities or no longer worth the political costs.
"It looks more like a production facility than a research facility," an American official deeply involved in the issue said today. "But this may be a face-saving way for the North Koreans to declare the facility exists" and begin to back away from the problems it is causing.
The issue has taken on new urgency in Washington in recent months with Robert Gates, Director of Central Intelligence, telling Congress that North Korea could be a few months to a few years away from producing its first bomb.
Japanese officials have also made it clear to North Korea that unless the nuclear issue is resolved, they cannot begin discussions of normalizing diplomatic relations with the North or providing economic aid to the country, whose economy seems near collapse.
The strongest signs that North Korea had changed course came this weekend, when two separate delegations visiting Pyongyang simultaneously -- a study group from the Carnegie Endowmment for International Peace, and a group of American and Japanese reporters traveling with an economic mission from Japan -- were told by officials that the nuclear agency would be able to examine any buildings it wished.
 
Keeping Reactors Running
 "We have nothing to hide," Song Rak Un, head of American affairs at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, told the reporters on Saturday. "Our intention is to allow inspection of any facility we have."
Choe Jong Sun, an official of the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry, described the radiochemistry laboratory to the Caregie group and disclosed that the North Koreans had already conducted reprocessing experiments at Yongbyon, using spent fuel to produce "a little bit of plutonium for experimental purposes."
But when he was asked by Leonard Spector, head of the Carnegie Endowment's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Project, how much plutonium had been produced, he said "next to nothing." It would take six to nine kilograms, or 13 to 18 pounds, of plutonium to produce one weapon.
According to a report the Carnegie group issued this week, the North Korean officials also said that they had run into considerable troubles keeping their nuclear reactors running, suggesting that they have not yet built up a stockpile of spent fuel ready for conversion into plutonium. That contradicts Mr. Gates' recent testimony that at least one reactor in North Korea has been running continuously for several years.
 
3 Power Plants Planned
 In their filing to the agency, the North Koreans said they had four nuclear reactors currently running or under construction. One is an aging, small research reactor that has been under International Atomic Energy Agency inspection for 15 years. Another was described as a five-megawatt experimental nuclear power reactor at Yongbyon, which burns natural uranium -- easily mined in North Korea -- and is modified by graphite rather than expensive, imported "heavy water." Nearby is what the North Koreans said is a 50 megawatt reactor still under construction.
In addition North Korea said that it was constructing a 200-megawatt reactor in North Pyongan Province, in the northwestern corner of the coutnry near the border with China. It said that it hoped to build three 635-megawatt plants along the eastern coast. Those are believed to be plants that Pyongyang previously agreed to buy from the former Soviet Union.
But the deal has been delayed for years, apparently because of fears about the weapons project and because Russia is now demanding that North Korea pay for its purchases in scarce hard currency.
The report to the agency also said that North Korea currently runs several uranium mines and two centers for producing uranium concentrate, also known as "yellowcake."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
With Few Tools, Ueberroth Begins Mission in Riot Area

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 6

 BODY:
Peter V. Ueberroth, who was appointed last week by Mayor Tom Bradley to lead the rebuilding of the South-Central area, is full of ambitious ideas about luring industry back to the community, creating thousands of permanent jobs and giving new hope to residents who feel economically disenfranchised.
But for now, Mr. Ueberroth does not even have a telephone number. In fact, he said this week that he had only a skeletal staff, no specific commitments for government or private financing, few lines of communication to the city's minority leaders and only a vague notion of how to carry out his ideas. He was finally able to start moving into some donated office space in downtown Los Angeles late today, although it could be another day or two before the office is up and running. 
 More than anyone else, the 54-year-old Mr. Ueberroth is being looked to not just to help reopen stores and clear the charred rubble of what many residents here are referring to as "the rebellion," but to reverse a decadeslong decline in the economic opportunity available to the South-Central area's mostly black and Hispanic residents.
 
Vast Scope of Task
 Mr. Ueberroth is in many ways being asked to achieve what governments, community groups and corporations have failed to do in the years since the Watts riots of 1965 made clear the festering resentment of the city's blacks. It is, to say the least, a monumental undertaking for Mr. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, who gained prominence for his role in organizing the 1984 Summer Olympics, which came off nearly flawlessly.
His appointment to lead the rebuilding effort has been widely criticized by the leaders of the city's diverse and often fractious minority communities, who wonder whether a white Republican who lives in affluent Laguna Beach can fully understand their needs.
On Tuesday, Mr. Ueberroth agreed to a demand by Representative Maxine Waters, a black Democrat who represents much of the South-Central area, that he appoint as his second-in-command Brenda Shockley, a black lawyer who has been running an economic development program in the South-Central area, Ms. Waters said.
Even Mr. Ueberroth admits to some doubts about whether he will be able to rally the support necessary from both government and businesses to revitalize an area that was one of the nation's poorest urban communities even before being ravaged by looting, arson and violence.
"We don't want to raise false expectations and then not deliver," Mr. Ueberroth said at a meeting with a small group of reporters on Tuesday night. "These communities have had a lot of that over the years."
Mr. Ueberroth said he had spent his first days on the job crisscrossing the city and the nation, meeting with government officials and community leaders and flying to New York and Chicago to meet with corporate executives. He said hundreds of large companies, representing a wide array of industries, had been trying to get through to him with offers of help.
But he said he wanted to discourage corporate executives from thinking in terms of donations and to try to persuade them to make long-term commitments to the area's revival by locating new factories, stores or other enterprises there.
"I believe there are really substantial and responsible corporate citizens out there that wish to make contributions, but that's not what we're seeking," Mr. Ueberroth said. "We're seeking commitments long-term to an area that's been devastated. Part of that commitment is jobs, on a profitable basis, not a handout basis."
Mr. Ueberroth said he had heard estimates that 25,000 jobs had been lost, at least temporarily, because of the riots. But he said he believed those estimates were "very, very low." There has not yet been an official count of lost jobs or of what proportion of those losses might be permanent.
Mr. Ueberroth said his main goal was to attract companies that were not previously doing business in the area. Mr. Ueberroth said the rebuilding effort would depend to some extent on the ability of governments to offer companies tax incentives, funds for programs to train workers and other financial support.

HEADLINE: A Public Battle Over Secret Codes

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
An issue long relegated to testy grumbling between software engineers and intelligence agents has suddenly grown into a public dispute between the Bush Administration and business executives.
In a digital age that finds more and more information protected by elaborate coding techniques, both sides are asking: Who should hold the keys to the codes? 
 Not the Government, say members of an increasingly militant computer and software industry. Apple Computer, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems are among the companies vowing to oppose Federal efforts to keep tight control on the use of coding technology, known as encryption.
"There is really no way to control this technology," said Nathan P. Myhrvold, vice president for advanced technology at Microsoft. "What are you going to do, call up John Gotti and tell him that it's illegal to use coding technology? All regulations do is hurt people who are trying to be law-abiding, and it's a nightmare for business users who are trying to protect information."
 
Technique Available to All
 Once a tool only of diplomats, military officials and spies, advanced encryption techniques have become available to anyone with access to cheap computer chips.
Nowadays, virtually all information can be translated into digital form and protected with electronic codes -- whether it is a cellular telephone conversation, electronic memo, medical record, corporate payroll, television program or cash from the automated teller machine. And advances in hardware and software have made these codes virtually uncrackable to anyone not knowing the precise string of letters or numbers that represents the key to translating the encrypted information.
A House Judiciary panel will hear testimony on the issue today, for the second time in nine days, as Congress ponders whether to resurrect legislation that would give intelligence officials a greater ability to monitor the use of encryption by businesses and individuals.
An alternative move, favored by a growing number of industry executives, would be to scale back Government control of computer encryption by curtailing the powerful National Security Agency's broad jurisdiction over the private use and export of encryption technology. The President has vowed to veto such a bill.
In his concluding remarks at last week's hearing, Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas, chairman of the subcommittee, indicated that business executives would have a chance in the next session to present their case. "We need to examine closely the claims by industry that the current attempts by U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies to restrict this technology will seriously impair privacy and technological development in our country," he said.
 
Working on Differences
 The computer industry had been trying for months to work out its differences quietly with the N.S.A., the secretive Pentagon branch whose job it is to protect the military's computers and conduct global electronic intelligence gathering. But dissent within the industry and the convening of Congressional hearings have brought the dispute into the open.
Since the first computers appeared in the 1940's, old-line manufacturers like I.B.M. have traditionally cooperated -- however grudgingly -- with national-security and law-enforcement officials to keep computer codes out of the wrong hands and the keys in the right ones. Such cooperation was wise in the days when the military and the Federal Government were the largest computer customers. And during the cold war, it was easier for the Government to defend its policies.
 
New Attitude Among Companies
 But lately, the younger generation of companies that grew up selling business computers, including Apple, Microsoft and Sun, has dug in its heels. The companies argue that Government efforts to stifle encryption technology is not only wrong but futile, putting American business at a disadvantage to foreign competitors who face few constraints in creating and using encryption.
"The most important security measures in which any of us engage in our daily business no longer have anything to do with safes, locks guards or badges," said Whitfield Diffie, a computer researcher at Sun Microsystems and one of the nation's leading cryptographers. "Modern security technology has transplanted written signatures and the simple act of recognizing a colleague from the traditional world of face-to-face meetings and pen-and-ink communications to a world in which digital electronic communications are the norm."
The banking industry is also concerned about the threat of legislation that would force software makers to provide a "trap door," making it easier for Federal agents to decipher encrypted files. The industry currently transmits $350 trillion a year via encrypted wire transfers, and each day United States banks transmit 350,000 encoded messages transferring funds to other nations.
Changing encryption techniques not only would compromise the security of computerized banking transactions but would cost many millions of dollars, said John Byrne, general counsel for the American Banking Association.
But Government officials see any costs or inconveniences to business as the trade-off for maintaining law and order. "This is a very real problem," said Kier Boyd, deputy assistant director of technical services of the F.B.I. "Somebody who has a rudimentary knowledge of cryptography can generate something on a personal computer which would give us fits as far as reading it."
The genie, indeed, is out of the bottle. Officials at the Information Technology Association of America, a computer industry trade group, recently obtained a copy of a commercial program called Cryptos written by programmers in Moscow.
Cryptos, which runs on a standard I.B.M. personal computer, encodes data by the two most popular techniques. One is the United States Data Encryption Standard, which the N.S.A. established in 1977 to foster a commercial encryption format that businesses could use (and the Government could read, as needed). The second is known simply as RSA, an encryption format widely adopted for business use.; it was developed outside the N.S.A.'s sphere by academic researchers. The Cryptos package, which is available in software stores in Moscow, sells for about $200.
The encryption war between American industry and Government has been waged on several fronts in recent months. Just last month, for instance, the Justice Department began pressing Congress for a bill that would require telephone companies to install equipment making wiretaps easier to conduct in today's network. The limited introduction of encryption into the telephone network, along with the widespread use of fiber optics and digital transmitters, has made electronic eavesdropping much more difficult than in the days when snoopers needed to do little more than hot-wire a copper phone line.
And it was also last month that some industry executives began charging that the N.S.A. had played a quiet role in limiting the strength of a proposed cryptographic standard for future cellular telephones.
 
Opposing Needs
 "The N.S.A.'s needs run almost directly counter to the economic needs of the country, which include the development of high-technology products based on cryptography," said Marc Rotenberg, national director for the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a public interest group.
Before the International Business Machines Corporation introduced its newest family of mainframes in 1991, I.B.M. tried for more than a year to persuade the N.S.A. to allow it to build a special piece of hardware that would automatically encode information processed by the new computers. Finally, after unsuccessful meetings that went as high as Adm. William O. Studeman, director of the agency at the time, and high-ranking I.B.M. officials, the company threw up its hands. It now submits individual license requests for each export sale -- and is frequently turned down.
Corporate executives and industry consultants who have experience in dealing with the N.S.A. say that despite the end of the cold war and the growing importance of cryptography for business purposes, they expect the agency to continue resisting any fundamental challenges to its control.
Still, industry pressure has apparently led the agency to attempt to negotiate a compromise with American software publishers.
The industry had originally backed trade legislation, still pending, which would move control over cryptography exports from the N.S.A. to the Commerce Department. But because the Bush Administration has threatened to veto the legislation, the software publishers have quietly attempted to arrange a deal.
But, the largest American computer makers, including I.B.M. and the Digital Equipment Corporation, have refused to participate in the negotiations, saying privately that the weakened RSA would not be acceptable to their customers.
The nominee for the job of director of the N.S.A., Rear Adm. John M. McConnell, declined to be interviewed for this article. Michael S. Conn, chief of information policy for agency, said that national security concerns with cryptography could not be dealt with in a public debate. But the agency, he said, remains confident that it can "continue to meet our mission demands in light of advances in technology."

Chronology: "The Encryption Tug-of-War"
 As computers left the laboratory and entered mainstream business life, the need for privacy of electronic data and communications followed. Researchers and the Government's national security apparatus have wrestled over standarads and secrecy ever since.
 
1976: Public Key Approach Is Proposed
 Martin E. Hellman of Stanford University and his colleagues, Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle, conceive a new, more practical way to protect information. One mathematical key that can be made public is used to encode the information, but a second, secret key is needed to decipher it.
 
1977: D.E.S. Becomes National Standard
 The National Bureau of Standard and the National Security Agency define the first public national encryption standard, known as the Data Encryption Standard. Because the N.S.A. shortened the standard's proposed mathematical key, some cryptographers say it could be broken using powerful computers.
 
1978: Government Clamps Down on Researcher
 Using an obscure patent law provision, the N.S.A. orders a University of Wisconsin computer scientist, George I. Davida, to keep secret all details of a computer security device he has developed or face two years in jail and a $10,000 fine.
 
1980: Security Review of Research Papers Begin
 A group of United States mathematicians and computer scientists decide to voluntarily submit cryptography research papers to the N.S.A. for review before they are published in scientific journals.
 
1991: Scientists Partly Crack the Code
 Two Israeli scientists, Adi Shamir and Eli Bhiman, develop the first mathematical technique capable of breaking the D.E.S. code under certain limited circumstances.
 
1992: Industry Attempts a Compromise
 Software executives propose a deal with the N.S.A. that would allow export of a scaled-down version of a popular encryption format for business users. I.B.M. and other industry critics refuse to participate in the negotiations, saying the compromise would make codes too easy to crack. The N.S.A. has not yet reached a decision on the proposal.

HEADLINE: Strategy for Child Bill: Piggyback It Into Law

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
House Democrats are trying to add a major child welfare program to a popular bill that would extend long-term unemployment benefits, hoping to show that they can get something done legislatively in a generally dismal session.
The move, led by Representative Thomas Downey of Long Island, would also mark the beginning of efforts by House Democrats to relate their legislative activity to the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee. 
 The unemployment benefits bill is widely seen as one of the few legislative certainties of this session, since most members would have great difficulty voting against it. Even the Bush Administration is reluctant to oppose it, despite its opposition to a provision of the bill that would permanently change the law to provide extended benefits in a recession.
 
Two Unrelated Bills
 The unemployment legislation would extend until July 1993 emergency benefits for people who have run out of their basic 26 weeks of state unemployment compensation, enabling them to get an additional 26 weeks if they were out of work for a year.
In addition, the measure would greatly liberalize the rules under which workers in various states become eligible for extended jobless benefits. Under existing law, workers in only six states and Puerto Rico would now be getting benefits if Congress had not passed two emergency extensions. Under the proposed new law, workers in at least 40 would now qualify.
The basic thrust of the children's legislation would be to provide money to states for services intended to keep families from breaking up. Federal law now helps states pay the cost of placing children in foster care but does little to intervene in the kinds of problems that force children into foster homes.
When Mr. Clinton visited Capitol Hill last week, Mr. Downey asked him about the issue, and others present reported that his answer, which was generally supportive of the legislation, impressed many of those present for its depth and interest.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, promised Monday night in a speech to a Harvard University audience that Congressional Democrats would be pressing health care and jobs bills and other measures in coordination with Governor Clinton. He said that would insure that "the public would have a concrete demonstration by one party and its nominee, in advance of the election, of what kind of a future they will be choosing."
Mr. Gephardt said today in an interview that he had discussed that idea with Governor Clinton after his speech and that the candidate had endorsed it in general terms. Mr. Gephardt said the child welfare measure would be an important signal of Democratic commitment to the needy.
There is considerable Republican support for the child welfare bill in both houses, but because it has been identified as a prime Democratic objective by Sen. George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, it has only one formal Republican co-sponsor.
Moreover, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee, is concerned that once anything is added to the unemployment bill, it will be hard to stop senators from adding more and more. Under House rules, that is easy to stop, but Mr. Bentsen said today that "competing interest groups" could overload the bill in the Senate, where the rules allow unlimited amendments.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he too was concerned about adding things to the unemployment bill that might hurt its chances. But he said he did not oppose Mr. Downey's approach.
 
Would Cost $3.5 Billion
 The legislation proposed by Mr. Downey and approved last September by the Human Resources subcommittee, which he heads, would cost $3.5 billion over five years, as against $2.1 billion for a similar measure awaiting action in the Senate Finance Committee. The House child welfare bill has been awaiting action in the Ways and Means Committee, where Mr. Downey's subcommittee sent the unemployment measure today.
Mr. Downey said he would seek to combine them in the full committee next week. "It would be good to take care of two problems at once, trying to help the unemployed and trying to keep families together," he said.
 
Addresses Abused Children
 Focusing on the children's legislation, he said: "We need to do something to address the 6,800 kids who are neglected and abused every day. We need to give the states the financial tools they need."
His measure would shift the emphasis of Federal concern by greatly expanding currently modest Federal aid to states for programs designed to keep families together. Under present law, the Federal government provides unlimited aid, as an entitlement, to foster care programs.
Mr. Downey has argued that this approach is not only costly but backward. He believes that increased spending on preventive programs like counseling and drug-abuse treatment and on facilitating adoptions would lessen the need to put children into foster care.
He said the unemployment bill "appears to be the one vehicle" that has enough momentum to carry the children's legislation through the House.
Neither measure is directly related to the Los Angeles riots. But there may well be efforts to attach tax breaks for poverty areas to the legislation next week in the Ways and Means Committee. Congress voted for tax breaks in "enterprise zones" and extensions of breaks for low-income housing and employment of the poor earlier this year, but they were part of the tax bill that President Bush vetoed because it would have imposed higher taxes on the wealthy.

HEADLINE: Dow Moves Ahead 10.06 to Close at 3,369.41

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stock prices rose yesterday amid increasing expectations of an interest rate cut, but the market fell short of a record close as late profit taking chipped away at gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 10.06 points to close at 3,369.41, about 9 points below the record set on Monday. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outpaced losers by 1,041 to 693. Volume remained heavy at 200 million shares, though it was below the 200.6 million traded on Tuesday. 
 Rumors that the Federal Reserve might act to cut interest rates after the employment figures for April are released tomorrow increased enthusiasm among investors, though many analysts said the effect of such a move had already been figured into the market.
 
'A Lot of Anticipation'
 "We have had a lot of anticipation about this additional Fed easing," said Jack Conlon, managing director at Rothschild Inc. "If you get it, I think it will already be in the market. If you don't, it will be problematic."
Strong interest in the Treasury's auction of $11 billion in 10-year notes also helped stocks. On the secondary market, the Treasury's 30-year bond ended the day up about 13/32 , cutting its yield to 7.96 percent, from 7.99 percent on Tuesday.
Strong performances by stocks in London and Tokyo earlier yesterday lured American investors back to the market after Tuesday's selloff.
 
Possible Correction
 But the failure of the Dow to break through the 3,400 level had some traders talking about pulling back soon.
"The market looks like it is starting to struggle a little bit," said Gregory Nie, a market analyst at Kemper Securities. "We are looking for a pullback in the May-June period."
Analysts said such a correction was probably needed before the average could push significantly higher.
"If we have a fairly strong employment number, I think it unlikely that the Fed will act, in which case the market will have to pull back and retrench," said Robert Walberg, an analyst at MMS International.
Among active issues, Caesars World added 2 1/2, to 32 1/2. Oppenheimer & Company repeated a "buy" rating on the casino stock despite disappointing earnings projections.
Telefonos de Mexico rose 3/4, to 57 3/8, on heavy volume ahead of its secondary offering, which is expected next week.
American Barrick edged up 5/8, to 24 1/8. Merrill Lynch upgraded the Toronto-based stock to "buy" from "above average."
 
Bank Issues Advance
 Bank shares rose after the bond market rallied. Chemical Banking rose 3/4, to 38 1/2; Bankers Trust New York added 1 5/8, to 60 3/4, and Chase Manhattan gained 1 1/8, to 28.
Among active over-the-counter issues, Adaptec rose 3/8, to 18 3/4, after Robertson Stephens raised earnings estimates on the computer company.

HEADLINE: $200 Million From M.A.C. Sets Off Clash

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The drive to spend a $200 million surplus from the Municipal Assistance Corporation on the public schools erupted into a major clash over spending priorities yesterday as the corporation's chairman warned the Dinkins administration that the city must earmark the money for school programs or risk losing it.
The warning from Felix G. Rohatyn came five days after Gov. Mario M. Cuomo publicly endorsed the idea to give the money to the schools. The Mayor yesterday stood by his position that the surplus should be used to reduce the size of government through early retirement plans, raises and other incentives. 
 And his aides responded to Mr. Rohatyn's warning by saying that any determination of how the money is spent should be the Mayor's, not Mr. Rohatyn's, Mr. Cuomo's or anyone else's.
Mr. Rohatyn publicly lined up with those supporting plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in M.A.C. funds, including the surplus, on the schools at a somewhat contentious meeting of the assistance corporation yesterday. Besides the Governor, plans for such spending have been endorsed in the last week by Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez and the City Council.
 
The Final Word?
 Mr. Rohatyn's warning raises the question of who has the final word on the spending. Last week, when the Governor said he supported spending the money on the schools, he added that the ultimate decision was the Mayor's. Yesterday, he repeated that through his spokeswoman, Anne Crowley, who said, "The Governor would like to see the money used for education, but if the Mayor, Mr. Rohatyn and Mr. Cuomo do not all agree, the Governor knows that it could be used for something else."
Ms. Crowley added that Mr. Rohatyn told the Governor that while he preferred the money to be spent on education, he would not stand in the way of the Mayor's proposal if the Governor endorsed it. But that is unlikely because Mr. Cuomo has already made clear that he would like the money spent on the schools and because Mr. Rohatyn and the nine M.A.C. directors are all appointed by the Governor.
As head of the assistance corporation, which was set up during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's to help sell bonds for the city, Mr. Rohatyn has played a major role in shaping the city's finances for nearly two decades. He said yesterday that if Mr. Dinkins did not commit himself to using the money for the schools, the assistance corporation would most likely use the $200 million surplus, which the corporation generated by refinancing its bonds at a lower interest rate, to reduce its debt.
In an unusual lobbying effort, Chancellor Fernandez, the Board of Education president, Carl H. McCall, and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, attended the M.A.C. meeting yesterday and testified in favor of the education spending.
But the director of the city's Office of Management and Budget, Philip R. Michael, and the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Barry F. Sullivan, also came to the meeting to defend what they said was Mayor Dinkins's right to decide where the money should be spent.
"We are listening to advocates for something everyone believes in, education, but we are doing so without listening to advocates for other equally important issues," Mr. Sullivan said. "The Mayor has to deal with these other issues and it is he who is must decide, for example, what is more pressing, repairing our infrastructure or buying a new computer."
At one point, Mr. Michael and Mr. Fernandez exchanged words over whether the board had received its fair share of money and whether it needed to cut fat from its own budget.
 
'Very Simple Efficiency'
 "Obviously we all know that it's much easier to spend than it is to save, and a very simple efficiency of 1 percent at the board could bring annual savings of $75 million," Mr. Michael said. But Mr. Fernandez countered by saying the city's schools had one of the lowest ratios of administrators to faculty in the state and that in its latest budget plan the administration had failed to account for the big increase in the student population.
Mr. Rohatyn called on the Council, the Mayor and the board to formulate a joint plan to spend the M.A.C. surplus on education.
Mr. Fernandez has proposed spending the $200 million surplus in $70 million annual installments over the next three years on education programs that would lengthen the school day for middle school children, provide computer-assisted instruction and address learning problems in the early grades.
Under the Council's plan, the city would tap $100 million of the M.A.C. surplus and $400 million in capital financing from the assistance corporation. The money would be used in these ways: $30 million for libraries, $142 million for computers, $200 million to build new schools, $20 million for special education, $16 million for school supplies and $75 million for school maintenance.
At the end of the M.A.C. meeting yesterday, Mr. Vallone and Mr. Fernandez said they believed that the Council and the Board of Education could develop a plan to spend the money on education that would be acceptable to both sides. But First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the administration would spend the surplus money only on programs that would improve productivity and cut the city's costs in the long term.
Mr. Steisel said the administration's ultimate goal was to spend it on initiatives that would help it in bargaining with the unions.
Stanley Hill, president of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, declined yesterday to say whether the surplus would help municipal unions in negotiations. But Mr. Hill sharply criticized Mr. Rohatyn. "Felix is trying to play the role of an elected official," he said. "He's not the Mayor, and for him to issue a threat is totally inappropriate."

CHINESE OFFICIALS ACCUSED OF FRAUD
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Chinese Government officials with conspiring with two American companies to defraud the United States of more than $100,000 in duties on imported textiles and clothing. Prosecutors said the indictment stemmed from an investigation into efforts to bypass import quotas by shipping textiles made in China through other countries. A1.
 
MAKING IT EASIER TO CHANGE A LIGHT BULB
It took six years of complaining, but from now on exhibitors at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center will be able to screw in a light bulb without having to pay an electrician. Fabian G. Palomino, the head of the center, said that agreements had been reached with four unions that would modify work rules and significantly reduce labor costs. B3.
 
HOSPITAL CHIEF'S VISION 
 Dr. Billy E. Jones envisions a city hospital system in which every poor person receives thorough, personal care, every clinic doctor is paid $100,000 a year and the infighting between public hospitals and private medical centers is only a memory. But Dr. Jones, who is taking over as head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, is the first to warn that he may not be able to achieve his goals. B4.
 
LANDLORD OF HAPPY LAND PLEADS GUILTY
Jay Weiss, who holds the primary lease on the Bronx building that housed the Happy Land social club, pleaded guilty to not having an adequate sprinkler system on the site where 87 people died in a fire. In a plea bargain, he agreed to perform 50 hours of community service and to pay $60,000 to help build a community center for Hondurans in the Bronx. B3.

THRUWAY UNIT'S NEW ROLE
In 1950, the New York State Thruway Authority was created to build and maintain the state Thruway system, the largest continuous toll-road system in the world. But under a proposal by Governor Cuomo, the authority's power would be expanded, giving it control over the state's canal system, as well as over an array of construction and economic development projects along the Thruway's borders.

HUNTINGTON SCHOOLS ACCUSED OF BIAS
An inquiry conducted by the State Department of Education at the urging of frustrated parents and advocates for minorities portrays Huntington schools as tending to steer minority and foreign-born children into special-education classes, often without the proper screening to assure that the students are in fact disabled.

PLEA BARGAIN FOR COP TURNED ROBBER
A former Howell Township, N.J., police detective has worked out a plea bargain in a string of bank robberies that he says he committed because he was mentally ill. That gives the authorities 15 to 18 years -- the amount of time that the detective, Allen R. Schott, could spend behind bars -- to find $360,000 that he stole. B8.

Sales Rise At Top Black Companies

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The nation's 100 largest black-owned companies posted a 10.4 percent increase in sales last year, despite the recession, bringing their revenue to $7.2 billion, according to a survey by Black Enterprise magazine.
The figures for 1991 represent a sharp gain from the growth level of the previous year, in which Black Enterprise reported a 5.2 percent sales increase for the top 100 black-owned businesses. Earl G. Graves, publisher of Black Enterprise, said the increase indicated "that we're coming out of the recession and that black-owned businesses have reached a point of sophistication that we can overcome a number of economic obstacles." 
 Nonetheless, many entrepreneurs said the recession had hit many black-owned business especially hard. "All businesses are affected by the economic environment in which they operate, particularly small businesses," said Reginald F. Lewis, chairman and chief executive of TLC Beatrice International Holdings, the food-processing and distribution company, which is No. 1 on the list.
"Many of the businesses owned by African-Americans are small," Mr. Lewis said, "and there is often a disproportionate impact on those businesses in times of economic recession."
 
21 New Members
 The list, which will appear in the June issue of the magazine, included first appearances by 21 businesses in a variety of industries. Rap music made its debut on the list with Rush Communications, the New York-based record and entertainment company headed by Russell Simmons, the rap impresario. The company reported sales of $33.8 million and took the 32d spot on the list.
Another newcomer, RMS Technologies Inc., a computer and technical services company based in Marlton, N.J., with sales of $79.8 million, was eighth on the list.
Another new member of the Black Enterprise list was the Mays Chemical Company, a producer and distributor of industrial chemicals. The company, based in Indianapolis, ranked 13th on the list and reported sales of $56.7 million. Just behind Mays Chemical was Pulsar Data Systems Inc., a systems-integration and office-automation concern based in Lanham, Md. It reported sales of $53 million.
Also appearing for the first time, in the No. 15 spot, was Black Entertainment Television Holdings Inc., the Washington-based cable television network that earlier this year raised about $33 million in a public offering. The company, which is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange, reported sales last year of $50.8 million.
 
Who Was Eligible
 Because the great majority of companies on the Black Enterprise list are private, their net-income figures are not available. To qualify for the top-100 list, a company must be at least 51 percent owned by black executives and must have operated for at least a year, Black Enterprise said.
Candidates also must manufacture or sell a product or provide an industrial or consumer service. Black Enterprise also publishes annual listings for black-owned or black-controlled car dealerships and banks.
Last year's top five positions on the industrial and service list remained the same this year.
In the top position for the fourth consecutive year was Mr. Lewis's company, TLC Beatrice International Holdings, which includes the international operations of the Beatrice Companies, which Mr. Lewis purchased five years ago. TLC Beatrice, based in New York, reported sales of $1.54 billion last year.
In second place was the Johnson Publishing Company, the magazine, broadcasting and cosmetics concern based in Chicago. Johnson Publishing's sales totaled $261.3 million. The company's magazines include Ebony, Jet and EM.
In the No. 3 spot again this year was the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company, the soft-drink bottling concern owned by the entrepreneur J. Bruce Llewellyn. Another company headed by Mr. Llewellyn, Garden State Cable TV, was ranked sixth on the list. The companies reported sales of $256 million and $88 million, respectively.
H. J. Russell & Company, the Atlanta-based construction and food-services company, was ranked fourth with sales of $143.5 million. And Barden Communications Inc., the Detroit-based communications and real estate development company, was fifth, with sales of $91.2 million.
The magazine also reported that employment for the top 100 black-owned companies increased 3.9 percent between 1990 and 1991.

HEADLINE: Israel to Boycott 2 Parts of Peace Talks

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 6

 BODY:
Israel has given formal notice that it will boycott two phases of regional peace talks scheduled to begin next week because Palestinians from outside the occupied territories will be taking part, officials said today.
The Israeli decision to stay away from separate discussions on Middle East refugee problems and economic development was relayed over the last two days to the hosts for those talks, Canada and the European Community. 
 But officials said Israel still planned to take part in three other phases of regionwide negotiations, planned for the next two weeks and focused on arms control, the environment and the sharing of water resources. In those talks, the Israelis said, they have no objections to the Palestinians expected to be sitting at the table.
Moreover, the officials said, their position in this so-called "multilateral" round of the Middle East peace process does not affect their commitment to continue the two-way negotiations on land-for-peace issues that Israel has been conducting with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. Those talks adjourned in Washington last week and are supposed to resume in Rome, although no date has been set.
 
Action Is Unsurprising
 There was nothing surprising about the partial Israeli boycott of the "multilaterals."
Israel says the sponsors have changed the negotiated rules in mid-course. It was agreed before the opening peace conference in Madrid last fall that only Palestinians from the occupied territories could be involved, and that arrangement, Israel argues, must be followed.
More substantively, Israel worries that to accept outside Palestinians, especially in the panels on refugees, would be to imply that it is prepared to discuss their right to return some day to their homes in Israel and the occupied territories. That is not a negotiable issue and never will be, Israeli officials say.
"We told the sponsors from the beginning that we will not be party to any negotiations where diaspora Palestinians take part, and our position has not changed," one official said.
 
Questions Raised
 While not unexpected, the decision raised questions about whether the affected talks can ever have full regional participation without one of the main parties taking the unlikely step of swallowing large gulps of pride.
The strategy of the United States, as chief sponsor of the peace processes, is to have the multilateral negotiations accompany and bolster the bilateral talks by putting once-isolated Israel into direct contact with a wide range of Arab countries and important outsiders like Japan and China on matters affecting the entire Middle East.
The regional phase got under way with a plenary round in Moscow in January, but then it was the Palestinians who boycotted the sessions because the United States and its cosponsor, Russia, had rejected the participation of so-called "outside" Palestinians, people not living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 
U.S. and Russia Agree
 To prevent that from happening again, Washington and Moscow agreed to let outside Palestinians join the working-group talks about to start on refugee issues and economic development, so long as these representatives are not members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The rules for sessions this month on the three other broad regional topics were not altered. They are talks on water resources in Vienna, on arms and security issues in Washington and on environmental concerns in Tokyo.
The United States has taken the position since the Moscow round that new rules could be applied to these working-level talks. Meeting in Washington last week with Foreign Minister David Levy of Israel, Secretary of States James A. Baker 3d reportedly said that Washington would not force the Israelis to talk with anyone objectionable to them. But he also said that the American position on Palestinian participation would not change.
His view, officials said, was that discussions on a matter like refugees would be meaningless if important segments of the world Palestinian population were not represented.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Hears of Human Toll in Workplace

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Against the background of President Bush's moratorium on workplace regulations, witnesses at a Senate committee hearing today gave sometimes graphic testimony on the human and economic costs of occupational injuries.
One young woman described in a halting, emotion-laden voice how her 20-year-old brother and two other workers in a meat packing plant in Liberal, Kan., died in a vat of blood after they were overcome by the fumes it gave off. 
 An editor talked of having to clean her bathroom tub with her feet because her arms had been disabled by a job-related repetitive motion injury by working on a computer -- an affliction not yet recognized as an occupational health issue. And union, insurance and experts on the workplace contrasted the growing cost of occupational injuries with the savings from regulations and prevention.
 
Stronger Rules Sought
 "It is clear that the Occupational Safety and Health Act needs to be overhauled," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who was chairman of the hearings before the Senate Labor Committee. Mr. Kennedy is a sponsor of legislation to amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 to give it more power.
Mr. Kennedy noted that 10,000 Americans, or 40 people each working day, died each year from occupational injuries. He said 100,000 more, or 400 a day, died from occupational-related diseases.
The hearings come in the wake of arguments made by the Administration's budget office earlier this year that workplace regulations were hazardous to workers' health because the increased cost of regulations to employers would result in wage cuts or lay-offs.
"The President says he cares about American workers, but his idea of helping workers was to prohibit protective safety and health regulations unless someone could prove that they promote economic growth," said Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio. "Most recently, his Administration blocked important worker health regulations, based on the twisted logic that less protection would save lives."
In March, James B. MacRae Jr., acting administrator of the O.M.B.'s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, said the result of new occupational-health regulations would be poorer, less-healthy workers because "richer workers on average buy more leisure time, mure nutritious food, more preventive health care and smoke and drink less than poorer workers."
Both Republican and Democratic senators objected to the argument. The budget office, which originally demanded a cost-benefit analysis of the new regulations by the Labor Department, backed off from seeking the analysis under pressure from Congress.
 
Another Viewpoint Sought
 At today's hearings, however, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, submitted a statement that said the witnesses called presented only one point of view. He requested another day of hearings on the proposed changes.
But Diann Clodfelter said that if regulations on working in confined spaces had been in effect, her brother, Homar Stull, and two other workers might be alive. Ms. Clodfelter told the committee that her brother succumbed to fumes from decomposing blood in the vat at the National Beef Packing plant as did two others who tried to rescue him.
"How many more workers must die before the Government finally lives up to its responsibility to protect workers?" she said. The Labor Department has been considering a regulation on confined spaces for 17 years.

HEADLINE: 2 Sides Clash Over Project for Brighton Beach

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
One of the most tumultuous and drawn-out land-use disputes in recent memory in Brooklyn was rejoined yesterday, as two sides clashed over a large-scale development to be built on the site of the historic Brighton Beach Baths.
At a morning hearing in Borough Hall, more than 50 people, including residents, construction workers, politicians and a small army of rabbis, debated loudly over whether zoning changes should be made to accommodate the proposed 1,600 housing units and five high-rise towers planned for Brighton-by-the-Sea. 
 Now on its third run through bureaucratic channels, the disputed plan won endorsement by Community Board 13 last month. But yesterday, as if warming up for the public hearing scheduled for June 10 before the New York City Planning Commission, which gives final approvals, more than two dozen local residents lined up to voice their dissent.
 
'Most Controversial'
 "Clearly this is the most controversial project that has come before us," said Marilyn Gelber, executive assistant to Borough President Howard Golden, as she stepped outside the hearing. "This is the largest project and the greatest testimony we have seen to date."
Though his recommendation to the planning commission is not due until May 15, Ms. Gelber said Mr. Golden has consistently supported the plan, a stance that provoked accusations of political corruption and neglect from opponents yesterday.
Mr. Golden, appearing alternately irritable and impatient, lashed out in kind.
"You tell a pack of lies about me and my integrity and then you want me to sit down with you?" he bellowed at Irwin Fruchtman, a member of the Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach and a former city buildings commissioner who asked to meet with the borough president. "I resent it," Mr. Golden said.
Earlier in the hearings, equally edgy comments came from Stephen Muss, baths owner and Miami-based developer, who testified publicly for the first time in the six-year dispute.
"I have left a trail as plain as day of listening to the views of both this administration and its predecessor and agreeing to make the changes which seek the common ground," said Mr. Muss, who has said this will be his last effort to have the project approved. "Now I find myself in the position of having nothing left to give and, therefore, nothing more to say."
Earlier versions of the plan by Mr. Muss's company, Alexander Muss & Sons, which owns the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, were approved in 1988 and again in 1989 by the community board, which oversees Brighton Beach, Coney Island and Gravesend.
The first two proposals failed, however, at various stages of the city-mandated Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, once when Mayor Edward I. Koch stepped in, then again when the City Planning Commission failed to approve the project. Since then, the plan has been scaled down and made more environmentally sound, proponents say.
Local officials and community and business leaders praised the development yesterday as an economic boon for Brighton Beach, bringing over 450 construction jobs to the low-to middle-income neighborhood that is home to thousands of Soviet emigres.
One rabbi with a nearby synagogue said the development would increase the size of his congregation.
A dozen unemployed men from Coney Island arrived in hopes that their public support for the project would help secure jobs for them.
 
'I Need This Job'
 "I need this job," said Jonathan Robinson, a 31-year-old father of two who arrived with friends to voice support for the development. "Everybody wants so much to have a job."
The project's opponents, however, continued to voice their objections throughout the four-hour hearing and said they would push on through the Planning Commission hearings. The nearby sewage plant, they say, which is already over capacity, would be overloaded with the influx of newcomers. Almost 50 parking spaces would be eliminated. Beach access would be restricted by the towering buildings.
"It will totally and irrevocably change the character of Brighton Beach," said Jean Kreiling, 53, who has lived in Brighton Beach for 15 years. "If Brighton-by-the-Sea is built, those people who live there now probably will not want to live there anymore. We will be living in shadows."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Tyco Toys Planning to Acquire Matchbox

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
In a move that highlights the rough-and-tumble competition of the toy industry, Tyco Toys Inc. said yesterday that it planned to acquire the Universal Matchbox Group, which makes Matchbox miniature cars.
If the acquisition, valued at $135 million, is completed, Tyco will leapfrog over Fisher-Price to become the country's third-largest toy company, behind Hasbro and Mattel. The company has bought several companies in recent years, including the View Master Ideal line, Playtime products and the Illco Toy Company. The string of buyouts has pushed Tyco's annual revenues to $548.7 million in sales in 1991 from just $87.7 million in 1986. 
 Under the agreement, holders of Matchbox common shares would receive $10.75 a share in cash and Tyco common stock. Universal Matchbox's shares closed yesterday at $10, up $3.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was trading as low as $1.75 in early 1991.
Mark Manson, a toy industry analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, said Tyco's close of $43.875 in New York Stock Exchange trading -- up just 12.5 cents a share -- reflected his belief that investors were slow to absorb the deal, which he considers beneficial to both companies. "It appears to be an excellent transaction for all parties," he said.
Tyco, based in Mt. Laurel, N.J., said it is buying Matchbox in part to gain its distribution network in countries where Tyco would like to expand, like Britain and Germany. Because of economies of scale, Tyco should also be able to increase Matchbox's profit margins to roughly 12 percent. "They've made acquisitions work in the past," Mr. Mason said.
Last year, Universal Matchbox, which is based in Hong Kong, earned $1.62 million on sales of $167.5 million.
Matchbox's core business of miniature cars also complements, but does not compete with, Tyco's industry-leading line of radio-controlled cars. Because of its decades-old history with consumers, Mr. Manson said the Matchbox cars were an "evergreen" product, and therefore represented minimal risk for Tyco. The small metal cars are sold in 120 countries under the Matchbox brand name.
Because of consolidation and competition from video games, the toy industry has left little room for smaller players like Matchbox, which has been shedding unprofitable products, like dolls, to help woo buyers. That recent strategy removed a stumbling block of price that stood in the way of reaching an agreement with Tyco, said R. Michael Kennedy, a Tyco spokesman.
The deal is subject to approval by holders of Matchbox shares, over 60 percent of which are owned by David C. W. Yeh, Matchbox's chairman. He has agreed in principle to the deal, Tyco said. Tyco added that Mr. Yeh, who lives in Hong Kong, might join Tyco's board.
The deal is also subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission for antitrust clearance.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Proposes to Enlarge Thruway Agency's Powers

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 5

 BODY:
In 1950, the New York State Thruway Authority was created to build and maintain the state Thruway system, which stretches 570 miles and is the largest continuous toll-road system in the world.
But under a proposal by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the authority's power would be expanded, giving it control over the operation and development of the state's 524-mile-long canal system, as well as over construction and economic development projects along the Thruway's borders. 
 While many people herald the idea as a way to create jobs, complete long-awaited projects and bring desperately needed money into the economy, many others assail it. To critics, the proposal is little more than the state's latest scheme to raise and spend money through an agency that does not need voter approval, a practice they say is too common.
"While the projects under discussion appear to be laudable, we would prefer their funding to be held to the same accountability standard of public scrutiny and voter approval that are applied to other publicly funded projects," State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said in a statement.
 
Economic Stimulus
 Under the proposal, which would need the approval of the Legislature to take effect, the Thruway Authority would be given responsibility over scores of projects. Those projects, Mr. Cuomo said, would generate 6,000 jobs and pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy.
In a news conference last month to announce the plan, a part of his "New, New York" economic-development initiative, Mr. Cuomo also predicted substantial help for the construction industry, saying that the authority was poised to make plans to spend $300 million on building in 1992, which would create more than 3,000 construction jobs.
Some of the most pressing projects, said Peter Tufo, the authority's chairman, include a plan to build an interchange at Stewart Airport in the Hudson Valley; a plan for $100 million worth of improvements to the Tappan Zee Bridge, and plans to refurbish the sparsely developed waterfronts in Buffalo and Syracuse.
Mr. Tufo also envisions transforming the canal system into a tourist attraction with a mix of public and private money, with marinas, restaurants and stores along its banks.
As a quasi-independent agency, the authority would be able to raise money, when the state could not, by issuing bonds. The authority, whose scope would be similar to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, could then use the money as it saw fit, without voter or legislative oversight.
 
Consider Borrowing in Context
 Cynthia Green, a senior research associate for the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by corporations, said that regardless of how worthwhile the authority's intended projects might be, its borrowing should be considered in context of the state's entire pool of outstanding debt.
"Whether the state uses its own borrowing capacity or transfers it to an authority really doesn't matter," she said. "You can't move bills from the left side of the desk to the right side and say they're taken care of."
The authority is still paying off the bonds it issued over the years to finance construction. The authority had promised to pay off the last of its bonds in 1996 and to remove the tolls at the same time.
That would change under the current proposal. The authority would indeed pay off its outstanding debt, probably before 1996. But it would immediately begin issuing new debt for other projects, with money raised from tolls to be used to maintain the roads and to pay back the new debt.
 
Where the State Cannot Go
 The idea of an expanded Thruway Authority that would borrow where the state cannot has upset critics like Edwin S. Rubenstein, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a public policy research group.
Mr. Rubenstein said that the authority, by continuing to collect tolls, will bring in several hundred million dollars a year that it can essentially use however it wishes. The plan to borrow more for future projects, he said, "is like paying off your mortgage and then having all your income used to take out a loan and do whatever you want with it."
The state has a long tradition of using authorities to pay for projects that are removed from voter scrutiny. More recently, the state Urban Development Corporation has been criticized for issuing bonds to help raise money for one-shot infusions into the state general fund and for projects outside its mandate, like new prisons.
Mr. Tufo and state officials say that the Thruway Authority is different from the Urban Development Corporation in that it issues bonds only for its capital projects and can pay back its own bonds through its revenues, primarily from the $300 million in tolls it collects each year.
"We don't require voter approval, because we're an independent agency," Mr. Tufo said. "But we can pay for it out of our own revenues, and our revenues are more than adequate to pay our debt back."
But Ms. Green said that even so, it was unwise to incur debt in the absence of a statewide plan laying out borrowing and spending priorities.

HEADLINE: Fed Finds More Signs Of Upturn

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Furnishing additional evidence that the nation is slowly recovering from recession, the Federal Reserve reported today that economic activity gathered steam in April but with the Northeast and the West Coast trailing the rest of the country.
Manufacturing appeared to be powering the recovery, but the report said retail sales and housing starts had also picked up. 
 The Federal Reserve's survey of regional economic activity pointed to an uneven recovery, with some regions and industrial sectors lagging behind others. It said that the Midwest and the South reported noticeable improvement over two months, but that the Northeast and West Coast experienced continued sluggish economic activity.
The report, based on surveys by the Fed's 12 regional banks, said several regions had reported declines in commercial construction, oil drilling and military production.
 
'Significantly More Upbeat'
 The survey, known as the Federal Reserve's beige book and published eight times year, said the most significant change since the survey in March was in manufacturing.
"While respondents in the last survey generally described the manufacturing sector as weak, respondents have been significantly more upbeat recently," the report said, noting some improvement in automobile and steel output and marked gains in machinery production.
In the March beige book, the Fed said manufacturing remained "generally flat, with layoffs and rising unemployment often noted."
In a speech Tuesday night in Boston, a Federal Reserve Board governor, John P. LaWare presaged the optimism in the April report, saying, "I don't think there's any question" that "we are in a genuine recovery, that we are in a positive growth mode and that that is going to continue."
 
State of Bank Lending
 The report noted that bank lending, which had tightened as banks worried about loan defaults, had begun to increase in several regions. Most banks are reporting an increase in loans for new mortgages because of pent-up demand and lower interest rates compared with those two years ago. But banks surveyed also noted a slowdown in mortgage refinancings and weak demand for business loans.
"Residential construction has continued to increase in most districts, although the rate of growth appears to have slowed," the report said.
The 12 Federal Reserve banks painted the following picture of the economies of various regions:
 
New York
 The Fed said economic developments in the New York metropolitan area, were mixed, with home builders noting greater interest from buyers but department stores reporting widely disparate results. Some stores said their revenues had fallen 13 percent, while others reported 13 percent sales gains, noting that sales of furniture and home furnishings showed the largest gains.
"Builders are more optimistic about the housing market than they have been in quite a while, and definitely expect sales in 1992 to be stronger than last year's," the report said.
Office vacancy rates rose during the first quarter in northern New Jersey, Westchester County and in Fairfield County, Conn., caused largely by corporate restructurings, some new construction, and corporate moves outside the region. But Manhattan and Long Island showed lower vacancy rates.
The survey noted other bright spots for New York City: the city expects a surplus rather than deficit this fiscal year, the theater district is booming, and Wall Street's profits and revenues are up along with hiring.
 
New England
 After a deep recession, most businesses surveyed in the six New England states expressed "guarded optimism that a recovery is imminent, if not already under way."
Retailers said first-quarter sales were equal to or up slightly from a year earlier. The report noted, "Virtually all retailers believe the New England economy is currently bottoming out or beginning to improve."
Half the manufacturers concluded that a modest recovery had begun and half saw no significant change. Half of the manufacturers surveyed planned further layoffs, while a minority are seeking some new skilled workers.
Businesses reported strong demand for products related to housing, automobiles and telecommunications, but they saw weakness in commercial construction and military production.
 
Middle Atlantic
 Economic conditions in Pennsylvania and Delaware were "just steady over all, although there were some signs of improvement," the report said. The area's retailers noted a drop in sales, while realtors said sales were picking up and prices were firming. Manufacturers reported a rise in shipments and orders.
In Maryland and Virginia, activity appeared to be stronger, with retail sales rising broadly and home sales and prices strengthening modestly.
 
Midwest
 The Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland said retailers, manufacturers and builders in the region "are more optimistic than in previous months that the renewed recovery will be sustained." It noted that capital-goods producers were uniformly encouraged by the recent strengthening in orders and profits.
The survey cited a large discount retailer that said sales of small appliances and home furnishings had been particularly robust in most Midwest markets. The survey said a Midwest supplier linked to light-truck production reported that shipments in March and April were up sharply from a year earlier. Order backlogs for heavy-duty trucks reached their highest level since the early 1990's. One manufacturer of office furniture reported it had delayed a planned layoff after orders picked up.
 
South
 The report from the Southern states was generally upbeat except for continuing problems in the energy sector. Retailers, auto dealers and real estate agents all reported better business. In Texas, retail sales gains were strongest along the border of booming Mexico.
"Most retailers are waiting for a significant and sustained recovery in sales before increasing their buying substantially," the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta reported.
Manufacturers related to housing seemed to be doing best, as they reported stronger demand for carpets, lumber, stone, glass and aluminum
 
West
 "Economic conditions are improving very slowly" in much of the region, with California holding back the area's recovery, the survey said. Most businesses surveyed expected sluggish growth.
Retail and auto sales were soft, while continued layoffs were reported in military-related manufacturing. Nonresidential construction remains weak, but home building and home sales are picking up. In Hawaii, for the first time in years, construction employment has fallen, in part reflecting a drop in Japanese investment.
Drought has hit parts of Idaho and Oregon and could cause a shortage of potatoes, beans, sugar beets and alfalfa, the survey noted.

Demand Strong for 10-Year Notes

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Demand for $11 billion worth of new 10-year Treasury notes was extremely good yesterday, helping to lift prices of outstanding notes and bonds.
The new securities were sold at an average yield of 7.53 percent, up from the average yield of 7.29 percent at the last 10-year auction on Feb. 12. 
 The $33 billion worth of bids submitted at the auction was the largest amount at a 10-year auction since the late 1970's, analysts said. Traders said the total included a large bid from one Wall Street house, which they would not identify.
In addition, noncompetitive tender offers totaled $689 million, a very large figure for a 10-year note sale. Those bids are usually submitted by small investors and small banks who are willing to accept the average auction price.
"We had a very good, solid retail book," the manager of one government bond desk said, "because the issue on the yield curve looked reasonably priced, particularly against the bond."
 
'Mom and Pop' Business
 Looking at the noncompetitive bids, Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company, said it looked as if "Mom and Pop trotted down to the Fed, took out the tender orders and submitted them." He added, "These are people looking for yields they used to get on bank certificates of deposit."
With two-thirds of the refunding auctions completed, the focus of market participants shifted immediately to today's sale of $10 billion worth of 29 1/2-year bonds, as well as the release tomorrow of employment data for April.
Since the employment report could easily influence price movements in the new bonds after it is released, there are big risks accompanying a bond purchase at the auction.
"The whole problem is Friday," the bond trader said.
William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc., said: "Usually there is one auction during a refunding that tends to be more of a problem than the others. So far, we haven't had any problems."
 
Report Sees Fed Easing
 While the good auction results provided most of the push on prices, short- to intermediate-term issues moved higher early in the session on a report issued by Johnson-Smick International, an economic consulting firm based in Washington.
The report said the Federal Reserve Board seemed likely to ease monetary policy again before the next meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee on May 19.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the 29 1/2-year bonds to be sold today were offered at a price to yield 7.97 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 10014/32 , up 13/32 , to yield 7.96 percent, compared with 7.99 percent late Tuesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 percent seven-year notes were offered at 9915/32 , up 7/32 , to yield 7.09 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 10010/32 , up 2/32 , to yield 5.20 percent.
The rally also helped to lift prices of the 5 7/8 percent three-year notes auctioned on Tuesday.
The notes, which were sold at an average rate of 5.96 percent, were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 5.86 percent.
 
Bill Rates Are Down
 Talk of an easing move by the Fed helped to knock down rates on outstanding Treasury bills.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.58 percent, down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 1 basis point, to a late offered rate of 3.72 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, a unit of the Chrysler Credit Corporation offered a total of $750 million worth of senior notes backed by loan receipts on new and used automobiles.
The bulk of the issue consisted of $720 million worth of 5.90 percent notes with a final maturity of Nov. 15, 1997, and an average life of 2.2 years.
The securities were priced at $99.8272 to yield 6.04 percent, 77 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 5 3/8 percent two-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing. This part of the issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Bear, Stearns & Company Inc. acted as lead manager for the underwriting.
The rise in Treasury prices, coupled with a slowdown in new issues, helped to raise prices of outstanding tax-exempt municipal bonds.
According to market participants, prices of most widely quoted tax-exempt securities rose by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point.
Following are the results of the auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

Tax-Exempt Yields in Gain But Taxables Show Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed in the latest week.
Analysts said the Treasury's quarterly refunding, whose final leg is today's auction of 29 1/2-year bonds, had changed the tone of the market. A week ago, few believed the Fed would soon move again to lower rates. But because inflation seems to be contained and the recovery is still slow, there is now some perception that rates could dip lower, taking money market yields with them. 
 Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's, said the employment report tomorrow could be the key to whether there would be some near-term easing by the Fed.
 
Supply Over Demand
 For the week ended Monday, yields on tax-exempt money funds moved up sharply as the demand for tax-exempt paper failed to keep up with an increase in supply. Analysts said the persistent decline in cash flowing into the funds in recent weeks had finally affected yields.
The seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund rose by 13 basis points in the latest week, to 3.24 percent, while the simple yield was up 12 basis points, to 3.19 percent. In the same period, the lagging 30-day compounded average yield and simple yield both increased by 5 basis points, to 3.01 percent and 2.97 percent, respectively. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Donoghue's said that while the average number of days left to maturity of securities held in fund portfolios increased by 4, to 52, it was not considered a significant event by its analysts.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 4.5 percent, while the equivalent for those in the 31 percent tax bracket is 4.69 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Fidelity Spartan Municipal Money Market Fund maintained the top spot for another week, with a return of 4.25 percent, up 21 basis points from the previous week. The fund's distributor is the Fidelity Distributors Corporation of Boston.
 
Taxable Funds
 Among taxable money market funds, assets fell by $4.7 billion in the week, to $496 billion. Most of the decline was in the retail sector where assets declined by $3 billion, to $334.2 billion, as the assets of institutional funds fell by $1.7 billion, to $161.8 billion.
The average seven-day compounded and simple yields slipped by 4 basis points, to 3.62 percent and 3.55 percent, respectively. Analysts said the 30-day compounded yield was down 5 basis points, to 3.68 percent, while the simple yield was off 4 basis points, to 3.62 percent.
The Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series repeated as the best performer among the taxable funds, with a return of 4.38 percent, down 2 basis points from its best yield last week. The fund is distributed by the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of the money funds is 3.5 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off on Rate Worries; Gold Declines in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower on worldwide markets yesterday, reflecting concerns about interest rates here and in Germany.
Gold prices declined following a mixed performance overseas. 
 On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $337.20 an ounce, down 30 cents from Tuesday's close. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $336.60 an ounce, off 35 cents.
Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust & Company in Chicago, said currency traders were concerned that Germany's central bank would raise interest rates because of the difficult wage negotiations between public-sector employees and the Government. The Bundesbank's regular policy-making meeting is today.
At the same time, Mr. Johnson said, traders were worried the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates if tomorrow's employment report for April shows weakness in the economy, or if the nation's money supply declines.
Either move would hurt the dollar because higher interest rates tend to prop up a currency's value.
In Tokyo, where trading reopened after a four-day weekend, the dollar closed at 132.70 yen, down 0.43 yen from last Friday. The dollar settled at 132.25 in New York, down from 132.90 yen, and at 132.40 yen in London.
The British pound gained ground against the dollar compared with Tuesday's levels. Sterling rose in London to $1.7940 from $1.7825. In New York, the pound fetched $1.7970, up from $1.7860.
Late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's closing rates, included: 1.6285 German marks, down from 1.6375; 1.4980 Swiss francs, down from 1.5060; 5.4860 French francs, down from 5.5160; 1,224.00 Italian lire, down from 1,229.00, and 1.19705 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19275.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $336.80 a troy ounce, from $337 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $336.85 from $336.60.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Less Flexibility In Europe's Rates

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
A FUNNY thing happened in Europe when the British Government moved to cut interest rates this week. The British bond market rally came to an abrupt end.
The market reaction points up the complicated relationships among European countries, as well as the continued focus in Germany on its own problems, to the exclusion of those of the rest of Europe. 
 Moreover, if interest rates do not continue to drop in Europe, that could slow growth there, in turn reducing demand for American exports and dampening this country's recovery.
The British bond market had been rallying strongly in the wake of the surprising Conservative victory in last month's elections. In April, an index of Government bond prices maintained by J. P. Morgan & Company showed a gain of 4.43 percent, including both coupon income and price appreciation, as measured in British pounds. With the pound also rallying, foreign investors enjoyed a double benefit, seeing a total return of 6.82 percent, measured in dollars.
But on Tuesday, when the Bank of England moved to cut short-term rates, by half a percentage point, the rally in gilts, as the British Government's long-term bonds are known, was nowhere to be seen. Morgan says its index fell by 29-hundredths of a percent, not enough to wipe out the earlier gains but enough to shake up some holders. Trading yesterday was mixed, but a 25-year gilt slipped in price to yield 9.22 percent, compared with a low of 9.16 percent reached last week. Before the rally began, it was yielding 9.8 percent, according to Bloomberg Business News.
"It's over for a while," said Norman Klath, a managing director and head of market research for Morgan in New York, speaking of the rally in gilts. He said it might resume later this year if Britain moved to tie the pound even more closely to other European currencies.
Those currency ties have constrained the financial flexibility of most of Europe this year, and they have made it much more difficult for governments to use monetary stimulation in an attempt to promote economic growth. The easing of British monetary policy, The Financial Times groused in an editorial yesterday, "has been modest compared with that in the U.S., Canada or Australia, which have had similar recessions." The newspaper called for more easing, but the market consensus is that such action is unlikely unless and until German policy changes.
Hopes for such a change were reduced yesterday when Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, called the country's current 4.5 percent annual inflation rate unacceptable, voiced concerns over monetary growth and said "it would certainly be too early to sound the all-clear on monetary policy."
Germany's Government is now trying to slow inflation by taking a hard line on public-sector wages, a policy that has produced widespread strikes.
The Bundesbank's council will meet today, and there has been speculation that it might move to raise short-term interest rates. Most analysts think this will not happen, but cuts appear to be out of the question.
A decade ago, German interest rate policy would have been watched by the rest of Europe, but it would hardly have been considered dominant. Now, however, currencies in the European Monetary Union are linked to the mark, and there are severe limits on the flexibility of governments to lower domestic interest rates without risking a run on their currency.
For that reason, it appears to many analysts that interest rates may have declined as far as they are likely to in Britain. The base rate, for loans to banks, was cut to 10 percent from 10.5 percent on Tuesday. That rate is roughly similar to the Lombard rate in Germany, at which banks may borrow from the central bank. It now stands at 9.75 percent.
The idea that British short-term rates could be as low as German rates is still hard to believe, after years in which British rates were far higher, and there is worry about reaction in the currency markets if British rates go lower.
The pound is now linked loosely to the mark, being allowed to trade in a 6 percent range in contrast to the 2.75 percent range of many currencies. There is talk that Britain, when it assumes the presidency of the European Community later this year, will move to the smaller range. Mr. Klath of Morgan says such a move might inspire confidence, allowing long-term rates to decline again, but there is concern among others that it would simply reduce Britain's freedom of movement even further.
Short-term rates and longer-term ones often move in opposite directions, but the freedom of long-term rates in Britain to fall further is limited by the fact that the yield curve is inverted, with short rates higher than long ones.
Eventually, it seems likely that Germany, too, will grow concerned enough about slow growth to begin to cut interest rates, perhaps renewing bond rallies throughout the Continent. But for now, it appears that Mr. Schlesinger's inflation concerns have cast a pall over bond markets far from Bonn.

HEADLINE: Students Who Learn to Write Learn the Key to All Learning

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As educational consultants specializing in teaching writing, we were not surprised to read that, according to a Department of Education survey, "American children do not write much in school and when they do, they do it poorly" (news article, April 17). Having had the opportunity to put institute writing programs in hundreds of schools around the country, we have observed ways that curriculum and teaching contribute to poor writing skills in students.
Schools that spend three or four months of their school year coaching children on how to take short-answer, standardized reading tests will, obviously, have no time to teach writing, nor even to teach reading. 
 Even when these schools ask their children to write, they do just that -- ask them, but do not teach them. Under the guise of not wanting to stifle creativity, they prevent students from learning the developmental, systematic structures that must be practiced frequently and from kindergarten through high school.
Many of our nonwriting schools mirror the anti-intellectual ethos of our country, which looks for the quick and easy answer. Our children spend their school hours underlining, circling and bubbling in answers to questions likely to come from vapid, watered-down textbook material.
Fortunately, we have seen extraordinary changes in teaching and learning where writing is the unifier of the curriculum. We have seen that students can be taught to write and to write well by our experiences in such places as Kansas City, Mo.; Dade County, Fla; Spring Valley, N.Y., and Public School 46 in Brooklyn.
Furthermore, students who learn to write learn to read. Through writing, they explain what they have learned, they recreate new learning, they entertain their peers and themselves, they share ideas, beliefs and feelings and, above all, they build a sense of their own worth.
When we begin to value the writings of our students, rather than their multiple-choice test scores, as the hallmark of their achievement, our schools will produce a literate, intelligent thinking population that is fully capable of participating in the global economy coming in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: The Talk of Seville;
In Expo Architecture, Mishmash Means Eclectic

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEVILLE, Spain

 BODY:
Imre Makovecz's Hungarian pavilion, widely regarded as the most inventive structure at Expo '92 here, soars free from the fair's architectural cacophony like some dizzy fantasy. Built from wood carved in folk styles and bearing a gray slate roof, it seems inspired by village churches but leaps beyond any one model with an exuberance that recalls the Catalan Antonio Gaudi.
Inside, the building's conceptual basis becomes clearer, with no loss of wit and style. The interior is divided, one portion symbolizing Hungary facing the West, with a simplified Baroque church front. Pass through that facade and one finds Hungary facing East, the wall exploding with undulating Slavic-style facades (more gray slate) and carved portals. 
 There is also a "Tree of Life" on the Western side, a jumble of roots and branches with a glass floor so that visitors can see the whole thing. The 22-minute tour is reinforced with pungent Hungarian folk music and vivid lighting and, on the Eastern side, a film and video show of the sort inescapable at this latest and most high-tech of international expositions.
 
Inevitable Diversity
 Ever since the first universal exposition in 1851 at the Crystal Palace in London, these fairs have been conceived as forums for technological achievement and advertisements for a utopian future. That most definitely includes architecture, and so the most ambitious world's fairs have always been intended as showcases for innovative buildings, landscaping and urban planning.
One trouble, however, is that with individual countries contributing their own pavilion designs, even the most stringent of guidelines cannot prevent a stylistic mishmash. In the age of high modernism, such jangling discrepancies contradicted the cool formalism on which modernist style was predicated.
Today's eclectic, post-modernist age means lots of junky ornamental froufrou, spangles and neon appliqued across what may be an utterly conventional neo-modernist box. If a country has tried to pinch its pennies, the result can be pretty mingy -- most embarrassingly for an American visitor, the United States pavilion and its decades-old geodesic domes.
But post-modernism can also mean wit and play and invention. And the stylistic diversity often contained within a single post-modernist structure makes the heterogeneity of a world's fair look like deliberate architectural principle.
"Diversity makes its own statement," said Gines Aparicio Soto, Expo's director general of projects and construction, in an interview. "We had some restrictions, but it is very difficult to put limits on creativity, especially in a time in which we have no single international style of architecture."
 
The High-Tech Prize
 Mr. Aparicio noted that the buildings at Expo, which opened on April 20, tended to be international or national. "I think the style that dominates is high-tech," he said, citing Nicholas Grimshaw's British pavilion. Expo organizers specified that fountains, pools and water walls proliferate to combat the southern Spanish heat both literally and psychologically. Mr. Grimshaw's building, itself a fairly anonymous (if ecologically sophisticated) high-tech construction, is graced with a particularly large, refreshing water wall by William Pye.
The prize for space-age architectural exotica, however, goes to Jean-Paul Viguier's French pavilion. At first it looks like a simple plaza with embedded lights, a floating, cooling roof and a single mirrored side wall several stories high. But there are secrets: the mirrored wall contains an exhibition highlighted by an ingenious scale model of separated sections of Paris. This is first seen beneath a glass floor, with a vertiginous effect of peering down through different parts of Paris at different distances. It turns out the model consists of one part facing upward and, stuck to its back, another part facing downward. The downward-facing part is reflected up by a mirror, creating the layered effect.
There is more: underneath the plaza is a mysterious pit, again done with mirrors. In it a film about the cosmos is projected, with eerie images in the darkened room doubled and redoubled. Visitors view the film either from the sides of the pit or from a moving walkway above it.
Although all the pavilions avail themselves of modern technology and practicality (gift shops and restaurants abound), some deliberately evoke traditional folk styles. Denmark, Norway and Finland are especially pleasing in this regard: elegant, simple buildings that speak clearly of their provenances. Tadao Ando's Japanese pavilion, billed as the world's largest wooden structure, has attracted attention, though its sheer size can seem overbearing.
Mr. Aparicio's favorite is the Moroccan pavilion, a gift from King Hassan II of Morocco to King Juan Carlos of Spain. It is intended to remain on the site, like 30 percent of all Expo structures, after the fair closes on Oct. 12 and was thus built with a greater richness of materials than some of the more overtly ephemeral constructs. The pavilion, designed by Michel Pinseau of France, blends ornate Moorish filigree, sweeping arches and chiseled stone pools with simple glass walls to enchanting effect. There is also an extensive formal garden.
Mr. Aparicio said that given the rapid shifts in the political life of Eastern Europe, the intentions and the designs of some pavilions from that part of the world had been altered. Even Hungary's design was changed in mid-planning. "It was originally supposed to be a glass box with live butterflies in it," Mr. Aparicio said.
 
Unifying Theme: Comfort
 As striking as many of the national pavilions may be, it is the overall layout and the attention to visitors' comforts that seems almost more impressive. Many of the Expo buildings (as opposed to the national pavilions) are distinctive, especially the cockeyed tentlike roof of Jose Miguel de la Prada Poole's Palenque, a breezy entertainment venue, or Gerardo Ayala's simply handsome Teatro Central, devoted to avant-garde events. The most appealing exploitation of the water theme is an undulating wall by the New York team of architects known as SITE. Its cascade effect, as in all the water walls, is obtained by a tiny angling, causing the falling water to gather in rippling sheets.
Mr. Aparicio is by training a civil engineer, and his deepest interest in the Expo constructions is their utility for Seville after October, post-Expo. In the long run, aside from the extra tourist income and national pride Expo is providing, its legacy will be a radical transformation of this lovely town into an international mecca. Cartuja Island, where Expo is situated, was until recently a flood plain for the Guadalquivir River. Now the river has been controlled upstream and opened up near Seville, where it had been blocked and stagnant. Riverside train tracks have been replaced by a combination esplanade and flood wall, soaring new bridges span the river and a ring of highways circles the city. There are 19 new hotels, whole new suburbs and an elegant high-speed train to Madrid.
All of Seville's social problems have hardly been solved. Perhaps the development, instead of energizing the local economy, will merely subvert Seville's charm.
But right now, late night in old Seville still finds balmy, orange-scented evening air, narrow streets, broad boulevards, bubbling fountains, strumming guitarists, stylish youths zipping by on roller skates and, everywhere, loving couples. If Seville can sustain this balance of new and old, international and regional, buoyant display and timeless beauty, Expo will have made its most important mark of all.

Western Germany's 2.3 million public employees settled for a 5.4 percent pay increase and a lump sum payment of up to $650, down from the 9.5 percent raise they had originally sought. [Page A6.] 
 But this strike was not so much about money as about the dark side of unification. Workers in the western part of the country walked off their jobs in part against the higher taxes they have had to pay for unification, and the inflation that it has caused.
Those in the east, who didn't strike this time, say they will later -- because they are still not paid the same wages that their colleagues in the west get and because they still want the fruits of unification that most of them have not yet been enable to enjoy.
The Government in Bonn is in disarray, and not only because Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is resigning next week, after 18 years in the post. With unification, German foreign policy has lost much of its direction and sense of purpose, having achieved the goal it had sought above all others since the end of World War II.
But unity, it seems, brought not the end of postwar German history but the beginning of a range of new and unexpected problems. "A new orientation of German foreign policy was and is necessary," the Berliner Zeitung said in an editorial today, "not because political opponents are calling for it but because the world has changed dramatically."
The economic problems of the eastern part of Germany were so unexpectedly vast after unification that they threw the Government into a deficit of more than $27 billion and pushed the inflation rate above 4 percent -- small figures when compared with those of the United States and some of Bonn's European Community neighbors, but grating on a public grown accustomed to robust economic health.
So the Germans got what they were asking for and are already tired of paying for it.
The economic problems are made worse by a property law that put past claims of ownership ahead of future plans for investment, according to a range of public figures from former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt on down.
 
A Country Still Divided
 But perhaps more critical to the country's future, the strike has laid bare a wide gulf that still divides the two parts of Germany.
Where two and a half years ago demonstrators in East Berlin brought down the wall the Communists had built in 1961, strikers in West Berlin in effect erected it again during the 10 days of the strike.
The red-and-yellow elevated trains and the subways worked in the eastern part of the reunited capital, but, just as during the decades when the city was divided, people had to get out at Friedrichstrasse station, once the main crossing point between Communism and capitalism for the few people allowed to make that journey in the old days.
For most of the last 10 days, Berliners traveling from the eastern half of the city into the west had to get there by foot or by car or bicycle, leading to huge traffic jams and street scenes.
 
Post Offices Closed
 Most post offices in western Germany have also been closed for the last 10 days, but were still open in the eastern part of Berlin.
"I don't know why," said a clerk at the post office at Friedrichsfelde Ost, a district about five miles east of where the wall once divided the city.
It certainly wasn't out of a feeling of solidarity with their western colleagues, said Wolfgang Schumacher, a bus driver who was waiting to begin his route at the station a few feet away.
"I work on this side for 40 hours a week for 60 percent of what a driver on the western side can make," he said. "Over there, they only have to work 38 1/2 hours a week and with 10 years of service a driver can easily make 3,500 marks a month." The sum is equal to about $2,150.
"We're not striking now, but we will be soon, because we want 80 percent of what they get on the western side sooner than the Mayor has promised to give it to us."
 
Parity in Stages
 Mayor Eberhard Diepgen had promised to bring public service workers in eastern half of the city up to 100 percent of what those in western Berlin get, but only in stages.
Rents and wages in the eastern part of Germany remain far below those in the west, a legacy of the difficult transition from decades of Communism to unfamiliar and expensive capitalism that began with economic unification in July 1990.
The streets in the eastern sections of the city today were, unusually, cleaner looking than those in western Berlin. Those looked, to a New Yorker, disconcertingly familiar -- littered with bits of paper and other rubbish instead of spotlessly clean.
"Berlin is facing huge problems," said David Anderson, an American who is director of the Aspen Institute in Berlin, "and the Germans have only begun to realize the full implications of unification."

HEADLINE: Paying Budget Piper;
A Constitutional Amendment to Avert Deficits Would Involve Painful Steps

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
An embattled Congress and angry voters are rushing to embrace a balanced-budget amendment, but hardly anyone is talking about the long-term economic complications it would probably produce.
Because the Federal Government spends $4 for every $3 it takes in, any serious effort to balance the budget would necessarily involve a disconcerting array of bitter measures that are likely to include raising taxes and putting tough ceilings on Medicaid and Medicare spending. In straining to balance the Federal budget, Washington might also slash aid to the states, forcing them to cut services or raise taxes in turn. 
 What is more, cutting spending and raising taxes to bring down the Federal deficit, which is expected to near $400 billion this year, could weaken the nation's already sluggish economic growth.
Still, many economists who opposed the amendment idea when it began circulating in the mid-1980's, now support it because they have concluded that something more than politics as usual -- something more than budget agreements and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law -- is needed.
 
Pain of Amendment
 Pain, they say, is inevitable whenever people living beyond their means are forced to tighten their belts. More important, many say, if an amendment forces the White House and Congress to eliminate the Federal deficit, this would bring down long-term interest rates and spur home building and business investment.
"As year after year drags on and we have failed to solve the deficit problem, one has to face that failure and maybe an amendment is the way to face it," said Benjamin M. Friedman, a Harvard economics professor who has written extensively about the dangers of the Federal deficit.
Economists who support the amendment confess to one lurking worry: that the politicians will use it as a gimmick. The fear is that once lawmakers vote for such an amendment, they can boast that they vigorously support balanced budgets, while shunning any serious efforts to reduce the deficit until the amendment is ratified later this decade.
 
No Help for Deadlocks
 After Congress and the White House have for more than a decade been unable to agree on how to end the deficit, many analysts wonder why a constitutional amendment would magically enable the two sides to agree. Many people fear the two sides will stick doggedly to their positions, amendment or not, with the Republicans wanting to slash spending and the Democrats leaning toward raising taxes.
One criticism of the proposed amendments is that they do not provide a mechanism to resolve such deadlocks. The competing amendments sponsored by Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator Robert W. Kasten Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, would allow Congress to waive the balanced budget requirement in any given year if 60 percent of all the members of Congress approve. But there is no guarantee they would approve such a waiver even in the event of a stalemate.
Legal scholars fear that if the amendment is approved and then ignored, the Constitution would be cheapened. The amendment, many analysts say, might not cause the Administration and Congress to abandon their hobby of budget gimmickry, like using optimistic economic assumptions, placing certain programs off-budget or moving the cost of certain programs to future years.
The amendment "could make the situation worse by encouraging even more gimmickry and fraudulent budgeting," said Lawrence Chimerine, a senior economists at DRI/McGraw Hill, a consulting concern in Lexington, Mass. "It is not possible to legislate leadership, courage and caring -- these are the bottom-line reasons why the deficit problem has not been addressed until now."
Mr. Chimerine opposes the amendment, saying it would divert the nation's attention away from trying to improve productivity and competitiveness. He said that if Washington sought to reduce its deficit to zero over three years, that would reduce the nation's economic growth by 1 percent a year.
Other economists oppose the bill on the ground that it may tie the Government's hands if the nation falls into recession. They feared that an amendment might, for instance, limit Washington's ability to pay unemployment benefits.
Some economists say that the proposed amendment should be accompanied by legislation that would require automatic spending cuts or tax increases if Congress and the White House failed to agree on eliminating the deficit. Others predicted that in the event of deadlocks, the White House and Congress might turn to the courts to resolve their disputes.
Laurence H. Tribe, a constitutional law expert at Harvard Law School, suggested that no matter what the courts did would create problems. On one hand, he said, the courts might consider the amendment unenforceable "because they might treat it as hortatory and advisory, in which case it would generate still more cynicism." On the other hand, he said, if the courts decided to enforce the amendment "it would implicate them in the extremely thorny problem of budget management in ways that would be hard to reconcile with any sense of institutional limits on the Federal judiciary."
In Congressional testimony on Wednesday, Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, said a balanced-budget amendment was needed because future generations were going to have to pay for the massive deficits Washington is accumulating today. "The interest of future generations are not adequately being protected by the representatives of current voters," he said. "Future interests require the protection of a constitutional amendment."
He hinted that Medicare and Medicaid might be targets for saving money, saying that "people who are knowledgeable about the Federal budget appreciate that the deficit cannot be addressed seriously unless the growth of mandatory programs is slowed." He noted that Medicaid costs grew by more than 15 percent a year over the past decade, and Medicare costs by more than 10 percent a year.
His testimony noted, for instance, that if Medicare hospital insurance costs were capped so that they rose by no more than the inflation rate that would reduce the deficit by a total of $72 billion from 1993 and 1997.
With many legislators saying the amendment has a strong chance of passing this year, economists stress that it is important to start whittling down the deficit now. They say that if the deficit remains at astronomic levels the year before the amendment takes effect, then Draconian spending cuts or tax rises would have to be implemented to balance the budget.
"If the amendment takes effect with the deficit still in the hundreds of billions of dollars," Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the lawmakers this week, "The Congress would be faced with the Hobson's choice of enforcing the new rule and inducing a deep recession or waiving the rule from the start, which would clearly be an inauspicious beginning for the new era."

HEADLINE: ACCORD ON LIMITS ON GAS EMISSIONS IS SAID TO BE NEAR

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 7

 BODY:
Hoping to break a longstanding deadlock between the United States and Europe, negotiators were closing in today on a compromise that would limit industrialized countries' emissions of gases tied to global warming, according to officials involved in the talks.
The proposal, circulating among delegates in draft form, would be a centerpiece of the Earth Summit meeting next month in Rio de Janeiro. Failure to come to an agreement in the preliminary talks here would seriously undermine the success of the conference. 
 Under the proposal, industrialized countries would limit emissions of greenhouse gases, with the aim of capping them at 1990 levels, a point the Administration has long resisted. But, yielding to Washington's position, the draft does not set a deadline or timetable for reaching the goal.
 
Shifts by Both Sides
 Instead, it calls for industrialized countries merely to recognize that returning to "earlier levels" of emissions by the end of the decade would contribute to the long-term objective of stabilizing the amounts of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.
Both sides are thus prepared to modify their positions, with the Europeans seeming to yield more in practical terms.
The draft treaty would also call for a framework, governing body and long-term process for continually assessing and responding to climate change as its nature becomes clearer in coming decades.
 
Catastrophic Warming
 The tentative deal was seen as unlikely to satisfy any parties fully. Environmentalists denounced it as unacceptably weak, even as a first step. Spokesmen for the coal and electric utility industries, which have opposed any restrictions on emissions, said yesterday they would not comment on the draft compromise.
The treaty would be signed by heads of government at Rio.
Scientists who are advising the talks here say that if the heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere at present rates, the earth's climate will warm by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century, with possibly catastrophic effects on the world's climate. Carbon dioxide, the most important of the gases, is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, the energy underpinnings of the industrial economy. The United States emits more than 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide.
The text of the draft circulating today said the compromise on emissions would "demonstrate" that the industrialized countries are taking the lead in working toward the long-term objective of stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at safe levels.
The prospective compromise on emission of the gases bridges the long-held positions of the European Community and the United States.
The community had argued for action to firmly halt carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Bush Administration insisted that for the United States to enact limits on emissions were unnecessary because energy-efficiency measures already being taken by the United States would nearly achieve the desired level in practice. The United States had resisted being forced to adopt targets and timetables it was not sure it could meet without causing economic harm.
In the compromise under discussion today, the Europeans would also accede to an American preference that all heat-trapping greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide, be included in the emissions agreement. The United States believes that its performance is improved when all heat trapping gases are taken into consideration.
Though the compromise aims for a return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions, something the United Staes had opposed, it would not actually set a deadline for doing so. According to the text, it calls for the industrialized countries to report periodically on their actions and results in limiting emissions, "with the aim" of returning to 1990 levels.
 
Treaty 'Is Now a Shell'
 The parties, according to a separate paragraph of the text, would "recognize" that returning to "earlier levels" of emissions by the end of this decade would contribute to the treaty's long-term objective of stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The years 2000 and 1990 are not directly linked.
Some environmentalists attacked the compromise on the ground that it appeared to allow governments too much latitude and room to wiggle out.
"It contains no meaningful commitment to reduce greenhouse gases," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "At best, it provides a procedure which could lead to real commitments in the future."
Others were stronger in their critcism.
"The climate treaty is now a shell that will allow continued degradation of the global atmosphere," said Richard Mott, treaties officer of the World Wildlife Fund. "Faced with an ultimatum from the U.S., the Europeans have abandoned their promise to include binding commitments in the treaty."
 
Aid to the Third World
 The compromise was reportedly emerging from intensive negotiations by a steering commmittee, representing 25 key nations and a representative of small island states. They are part of the larger, 130-member Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Climate Change, a body that reports to the United Nations General Assembly. The emerging compromise must still be approved by the full committee before the concluding round of treaty talks ends tomorrow.
Moreover, still to be resolved was the equally critical issue of the way in which industrialized countries will provide financial and technological aid to third-world countries in attacking the problem of climate change. The third-world countries' greenhouse-gas emissions are much lower than those of the industrialized world. But they are expected to grow rapidly in the decades ahead, and the draft treaty requires developing countries to undertake national programs for limiting the gases.

HEADLINE: Finland in $3 Billion Deal for 64 McDonnell Douglas Combat Jets

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Finland, no longer constrained by Soviet pressure to tailor its military strength to an international image of neutrality, is about to rebuild its air force with a fleet of American fighter aircraft.
The Finnish Defense Ministry said Wednesday that it was placing a $3 billion order with McDonnell Douglas Corporation for 64 FA-18 Hornet fighter-bombers, Finland's first purchase of American combat planes. 
 A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas described the order today as a "very important sale for the company." The FA-18 was chosen over four rival aircraft, and delivery is expected to begin in 1995.
"Until now, Finland's neutrality made defense procurement diffcult," a Finnish diplomat said. "But from now on, Finland will defend herself by her own means."
 
Questions of Security
 The purchase of such a large number of fighter planes by a country facing severe economic problems raises questions about Finland's security concerns. Although the collapse of the Soviet Union freed Finland from the neutral stance imposed by Moscow, it also stirred fears in Helsinki about the stability of Russia and the safety of the former Soviet arsenal.
"If you're Finland, you aren't just located anywhere," said Paul Goble, a former State Department specialist on the Soviet Union who is now a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "If you're Finland, you're located next to the Kola Peninsula, one of the most heavily armed places on earth."
Mr. Goble said that former Soviet military forces withdrawing from Europe are being "stacked up" along with weapons and equipment in the area bordering Finland.
"For Finland, there is a very specific threat," Mr. Goble said. "If something goes very wrong in Russia, one of the things that could happen is not the emergence of a right-wing central Government but the development of a local warlord situation."
The sudden expansion and updating of Finland's air force is symbolic first of all, he said, "and second, it is an insurance policy."
 
Used in Persian Gulf War
 The FA-18 Hornet, introduced into the United States Navy in 1983, serves as both a combat and attack plane and was used extensively in the Persian Gulf war. Finnish officials said one attraction of the plane was that it has two engines rather than one, an advantage when an aircraft flies missions in a harsh climate or over rough terrain.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee have been notified of the deal on the FA-18's because of its size and political significance, Congressional aides said. Finland has already signed a letter of intent on the purchase, and no challenges to the sale are anticipated.
Under the old formula, one-third of the Finnish Air Force planes were Soviet Migs, one third came from neutral countries, mostly Sweden, and the rest were bought from the West, mainly Britain.
Now Helsinki is apparently seeking a long-term relationship with one American company. McDonnell Douglas also sells the Finns most of the national airline's passenger aircraft.
 
Finland to Assemble Planes
 A majority of Finland's FA-18's -- 57 full combat aircraft and seven trainer versions -- will be assembled in Finland under an industrial cooperation agreement between McDonnell Douglas and the Valmet Corportion of Halli, Finland. The first seven planes will be built in St. Louis and the rest will be assembled from kits by Valmet. Additional work will go to a variety of Finnish subcontractors, according to McDonnell Douglas.
The only other European nation whose air force flies the FA-18 is Spain, which has 72, the company said.
The United States Navy and Marine Corps have about 1,000 of the planes. Canada has 132 and Australia 75. Kuwait has ordered 40 and Switzerland is negotiating for 34, according to McDonnell Douglas.
A Finnish Embassy spokesman said the other aircraft considered were: the American F-16, the French Mirage 2000-5, the Russian Mig-29 and a new Swedish plane -- the JAS-39 Gripen made by Saab-Scania A.B. Sweden had hoped that Finland would be the plane's first foreign buyer.

HEADLINE: Bosnia's Besieged Government Near Disintegration

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, May 7

 BODY:
With exploding Serbian mortar shells and automatic gunfire rattling their office windows and sometimes shattering them, the dozen or so officials running this rapidly disappearing country are more like a panic-seized crisis committee than a government.
"The Prime Minister is pacing the halls and doesn't know what to do," said a Muslim Slav woman standing in a bustling hallway in the republic's nerve center, the Presidency Building. 
 Here, President Alija Izetbegovic, a moderate Muslim Slav, makes decisions night and day with the heads of the republic's teetering military and security operations.
"There is no policy," said a senior presidential adviser, Izet Serdarovic. "There is no long term. Decisions are made each second as events dictate."
 
Losing Hope in Outside World
 For months, Bosnia and Herzegovina put its faith in the European Community and the United States to support its independence from Yugoslavia and its territorial integrity. But as Serbian guerrillas backed by Serbia and the Yugoslav Army have consumed more of the republic's territory with each passing day, the Sarajevo Government has lost almost all hope in the outside world.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina's Government played by the rules set down by the international community," a Western diplomat said. "They do not deserve this fate."
Ejup Ganic, a Presidency member, said: "What does the United States want of us? The West has only given us words and promises to apply pressure. Nothing else."
"We are surrounded," he said. "We've got limited amounts of food and a limited number of weapons. We cannot hold out indefinitely."
A land of high mountains populated by 1.9 million Muslim Slavs, 750,000 Roman Catholic Croats and 1.4 million Eastern Orthodox Serbs, Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognized by the United States and European Community as an independent country last month.
Most of the republic's Serbs oppose having an international border separating them from their 7.1 million kinsmen in Serbia.
 
Threats by West Ignored
 Serbia's rulers and their guerrilla proxies have ignored threats by Western countries to isolate Serbia politically and economically if the land grab in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not halted.
The Serbs' territorial conquest has left hundreds of people dead or wounded and driven about 500,000 from their homes. It has also left this country on the brink of economic anarchy.
Most Serbian ministers and administrators have abandoned the Government, leaving huge gaps in chains of responsibility. Worse, Serbian policemen have set up parallel police forces and driven out the legitimate law-enforcement authorities over most of the republic.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's "army," a popular-defense force made up of Muslim Slavs, Croats and many Serbs, has been thrown together so hastily that its troops wear sticker-paper emblems.
"Forty kilometers outside the city, there are men with no uniforms or emblems," said Mirsad Tokaca, a spokesman for Sarajevo's police department. "We have problems with criminals in our ranks. We have war profiteers, and there are people waging their own private wars. But we are fighting to deal with this."
The capture of a dozen armored cars and other weaponry has slightly improved the Bosnian forces' firepower, but it is still no match for the Serbs' arsenal, including tanks to multiple-rocket launchers supplied by the Yugoslav Army.
"The defense of Sarajevo is really the work of two local commanders," said Zlatko Lagumdzija, vice president of the republic's largest opposition party, the Social Democrats. "Both are convicted criminals who did their time and volunteered for the territorial defense."
"They take their orders from a guy who certainly arrested them five or six times," he said. "They're on the same side now, and we can thank them for being able to sit here in some kind of security."
Outside the Presidency Building, armed security men lurk behind trees and sand-bag barriers, staying out of the gun scopes of Serbian snipers perched on a hillside several hundred yards away.
On Wednesday, even a United Nations Under Secretary General, Marrack Goulding, came under sniper fire as he toured the burned-out hulks of buildings in Sarajevo left by days of Serbian bombardments.
 
Much Territory Lost
 Five weeks of Serbian attacks have left Mr. Izetbegovic and his forces in control of only a fraction of Bosnia and Herzegovina's territory. Serbian gunmen at barricades block normal food and medicine deliveries throughout the republic and have trapped thousands of people in several Sarajevo suburbs for more than two weeks.
Serbian leaders claim 70 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina's territory for a "Serbian Republic" despite the fact that Serbs here make up only 31 percent of the population. The Serbian leaders are also insisting on the partition of Sarajevo, whose population is more than half Muslim-Slav.
"It is the policy of the Serbs to rip apart the multi-ethnic social fabric here, to turn Serbs against their neighbors," said a senior Yugoslav journalist whose life has been threatened by the Serbian leadership. "They want Muslim Slavs and Croats to turn on the Serbs. They want to make life together here an impossibility."
Administratively, the Sarajevo Government is severely handicapped. The country lacks its own currency, passports and even an accurate roll of its citizenry. Sarajevo has no tax-collecting ability and no postal service.
 
Communications Disrupted
 Shelling of the capital on Saturday and Sunday left the Presidency itself with no telephone lines.
Communications disruptions have often forced government leaders and European Community mediators to negotiate with representatives of the pro-Serbian army over television and radio hookups, and amateur ham radio operators provide the Government's only communications link with most of the republic.
"Absolutely nothing functions," Mr. Lagumdzija said. "The banks work, but they haven't got any cash."
"The payment system doesn't exist," he said, "so practically everyone is working voluntarily."
A presidential adviser, who asked not to be identified, said: "Right now, the key problem is the most fundamental problem -- control of territory. This is a struggle for survival, and the only way we can win is with international support."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
From Riots of 60's to Riots of the 90's, a Frustrating Search to Heal a Nation

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 7

 BODY:
The battles in the streets of Los Angeles have ended, and the political battles have begun. At their core is the nation's most famous report on urban violence, which looked at burning cities a quarter century ago and called for a major Government effort to heal them.
"Only a greatly enlarged commitment to national action -- compassionate, massive and sustained, backed by the will and resources of the most powerful nation on this earth -- can shape a future that is compatible with the historic ideals of American society," concluded the Kerner Commission, convened by President Lyndon B. Johnson to examine the causes of riots that shook more than 150 American cities in 1967. 
 Since then everything has changed, and nothing has changed. Today, the Kerner Commission serves as a monument to a more optimistic era when the nation felt it had the will and the ability to heal its urban ills.
 
Era of Optimism Is Just a Memory
 "There's a fundamental difference in the attitude of the nation," said Anthony Downs, a Brookings Institution fellow who was one of the authors of the report. "The report was written at a time of rapidly rising living standards when people believed almost anything was possible. We no longer have the optimism we had then, and the kind of commitment to improving America's domestic life is totally absent from the present leadership."
In the wake of the riots in Los Angeles, President Bush and his spokesman Marlin Fitzwater have set the tone for the political aftermath by attributing the riots in part to the social programs of the 1960's and 1970's. But a quarter century later, a larger question looms about the Kerner Commission report: If that era of optimism, prosperity and commitment has left the nation with cities mired in poverty, violence and despair, what is the current environment likely to produce?
Headed by Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois, the 11-member panel, officially known as the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, was appointed by President Johnson July 27, 1967, after major riots in Newark and Detroit.
 
Panel's Warning On Split Society
 The report found that "white racism" was the underlying cause of the problems of the ghettos. And, in its most famous line, it warned that the United States ran the risk of becoming "two societies, one black, one white -- separate but unequal."
"For a good while we made progress on virtually every front in regard to the report," said former Senator Fred Harris, an Oklahoma Democrat who was on the commission. "But the progress slowed in the mid-70's and then stopped, and now we've begun to go backward in many ways. And I think there are very serious consequences for the path we've taken."
Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York at Albany, and the commission's associate director for program research, said the report was essentially an endorsement of the social activism of the Great Society. Its policy recommendations centered on four areas: jobs, housing, education and welfare.
President Johnson, suspicious the commission was being critical of him, declined to endorse its findings.
The report called for building six million housing units for low- and moderate-income people within five years. The nation did not meet that goal, but the report did lead to a major increase in Federal housing that produced 1.6 million units from 1970 and 1973.
The report also helped produce the landmark open housing legislation of 1968. There was also momentum for subsidized housing for low-income tenants, under which Federal funds were used to help them pay for privately owned housing. The momentum continued until the Reagan Administration worked to reverse it in the 1980's.
In jobs, the commission called for the creation of 2 million jobs over three years, half in Government and half in the private sector. The recommendations helped spur a series of public employment programs. By the peak under the Carter Administration in 1978, programs such as the Public Service Employment (PSE) program of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) were providing 750,000 jobs.
The programs, which were at times dogged by allegations of waste, were entirely eliminated in the Reagan Administration.
The report also advocated spending for urban schools, remedial and adult education and school desegregation. And it provided proposals for welfare, most of which supported greater availability of benefits. It did not address the potential problems of welfare dependency.
 
Push for Cutbacks In Reagan Years
 Over all, the tide for urban aid began to turn in 1978 when President Jimmy Carter's proposed three-year, $30 billion urban plan was rejected by Congress. The mood changed completely in 1980 when the Reagan Administration cut real spending for grants and aid to local and state government by 11 percent. Since 1980, Federal direct aid to cities has been slashed by 60 percent.
To many critics, liberals and conservatives, the main failing in the report and the era was an inability to foresee negative consequences of welfare dependency.
"There was an explosion of the welfare rolls during this period and that coincided with the emergence of the underclass," said Mickey Kaus, a senior editor at The New Republic, who is completing a book on welfare and social policy.
But Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Northwestern University, whose book "Rethinking Social Policy: Race, Poverty and the Underclass (Harvard University Press, 1992), said welfare policies, while deeply flawed, cannot be blamed for the riots in Los Angeles.
"You've got to remember, Watts occurred before all these things happened," he said. "Detroit erupted in 1919. Racial and ethnic conflict in the U.S. wasn't invented along with the welfare state."
He said, rather than a profligate rush to throw money at urban problems, the report helped produce a relatively modest array of programs targeted at the urban poor that in the end did not go far enough to satisfy their proponents and provided targets for their critics.
 
The Racial Division Obscures Answers
 One of the report's most famous and controversial findings was its conclusion that: "White racism is essentially responsible for the explosive mixture which has been accumulating in our cities since the end of World War II."
To some critics, the emphasis on racism, in both the report and the national civil rights debate, has obscured the degree to which the answers to the problems of the ghettos must come from within.
"The assumption was that white America was the problem and therefore white America was the solution," said Robert Woodson, a black who heads the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington, which calls for conservative, self-help solutions to inner-city problems. "It set up the proposition that the destiny of black America rested with what white America did."
Representative Gary Franks of Connecticut, the only black Republican in Congress, said welfare dependency, crime and drugs are far more of a threat to the urban poor than white racism.
But civil rights leaders say the case of Rodney G. King shows how pervasive and how misunderstood racism remains.
Earl Shinhoster, southeast regional director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the commission was not talking about whites as bigots but of an institutionalized system content to allow all the economic, social and educational advantages factors that produce success to flow away from the ghettos.
"Rather than an individual in a sheet and hood, we're dealing with a system that places a value and a value system on individuals and on groups," he said.
In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson appointed the head of the N.A.A.C.P., Roy Wilkins, to the commission.
This week, after Mr. Fitzwater blamed the social policies of the 1960's and '70's for the riots in Los Angeles, the current N.A.A.C.P. president, Benjamin Hooks, responded: "That's just a cavalier, irresponsible, irrational, right-wing, Republican no-answer to a serious problem. It's beneath the dignity of the White House to do that."
The exchange reflects the degree to which race has become perhaps the most explosive weapon in electoral politics.
"I don't think politics has dealt honestly with race in 25 years," said Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey. "Republicans have used race in a divisive way to get votes, speaking in code words to targeted audiences. Democrats have essentially ignored self-destructive behavior of parts of the minority population and covered that self-destructive behavior in a cloak of silence and self-denial."
 
Urban Problems Back Into Politics
 Since the report come out, the status of many blacks has changed for the better. In households headed by a married couple, the median income for blacks has gone from 68 percent of whites in 1967 to 84 percent in 1990. But, reflecting the breakdown of the black family, for all blacks, the median family income was 59 percent of the white family income income in 1966 and was 56 percent in 1989.
Experts say the disparity reflects one way in which the commission's most famous line fails to describe fully the reality of American life today.
"The great line about the two nations, that's not what happened," said Professor Nathan. "Instead, there's been a bifurcation and trifurcation and fragmentation of the black and Hispanic communities which has left the underclass behind."
Many analysts say that instead of the two nations talked of in the report, the past two decades have seen substantial progress by many blacks and an increasingly visible and troubled, but numerically shrinking remnant left behind.
For those left behind in the inner cities, nearly all the changes since the Kerner report have been for the worse. More jobs and influence have moved out to the suburbs, which now provide the largest group of voters in a Presidential race. From 1970 to 1990 more than four million whites left the nation's big cities.
Drugs, gangs and and guns are a factor in ghetto life to a degree that no one imagined 25 years ago. In 1960, 20 percent of all black children were living in fatherless families; now the figure is 60 percent. Economic growth under the Bush Administration will be lower than at any time since World War II.
 
A New Approach Is Called For
 Mr. Bradley said that what is needed is a new approach to problems of the inner city that borrow ideas from the left and right.
"There are some elements of what was begun in the late '60's and early '70's that clearly work," he said. "There are some that haven't worked. If we're serious about dealing with these problems we have to take that which works, both liberal ideas and conservative ones, and invest them with their full potential. We have to be clear that the answer to injustice is not mob violence. But the answer to injustice is not ignoring the conditions."
Representative John Lewis, Democrat of George, one of the leaders of the civil rights movement of the 1960's, said what the nation does not need is another Kerner report for the 90's.
"We've been down that road," he said. "We need to take actions that will give people hope. If we don't, I fear for our future."

HEADLINE: After Long Wait, New Boston Garden Planned

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 7

 BODY:
It's playoff time, and Red Auerbach fired up his cigar this morning, a gesture that generations of basketball fans have come to associate with the moment the Boston Celtics clinch another victory.
But Mr. Auerbach was standing outside the Boston Garden, not inside on its ancient parquet floor. He was there to celebrate an even bigger triumph -- the announcement that after 25 years of blundering, bickering and Yankee parsimony, Boston will finally have a modern sports arena, a new Boston Garden. 
 The $160 million building will be financed by an unlikely consortium of three local banks, signifying the first major sign of optimism about New England's economy after four years of recession.
"We went from a miracle to a nightmare and this is the morning after," said Ira Jackson, a senior vice president of the Bank of Boston, one of the three banks that will evenly split $120 million in loans to Delaware North Companies Inc., owner of the Garden and the Boston Bruins hockey team, for the new arena. "The region is saying we're back," Mr. Jackson said.
 
City's Spiritual Heart
 Construction on the new arena, on a site adjacent to the present Garden, will begin next year and is scheduled to be finished before the start of the fall hockey and basketball seasons in 1995.
"It's great, because the Boston Garden is not just a building, it's a shrine," Mr. Jackson said. Sixteen National Basketball Association championship banners won by the Celtics hang from its ceiling, along with five Stanley Cup banners won by the Boston Bruins in the National Hockey League. The Garden was also where John F. Kennedy spoke the night before he won the 1960 Presidential election.
With this combination of sports and politics, the two passions of Boston, the Garden is something of the spiritual heart of the city, more important to many Bostonians than august institutions like the Boston Symphony.
The other two banks participating in the loan are the Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, a subsidiary of the Fleet/ Norstar Financial Group, whose headquarters are in Providence, R.I., and the Shawmut National Corporation of Hartford.
 
Region Ready to Reinvest
 Since 1988 New England has lost 10 to 12 percent of its jobs, in the worst economic slump since the Depression in the 1930's, and the region's banks, saddled with huge losses from bad real estate loans, had virtually stopped making new loans.
But the three banks' decision to back the new Boston Garden, made only in the last few weeks, "shows they have regained confidence in themselves, and the region is ready to reinvest in itself," Mr. Jackson said.
Bankers and city officials alike expressed pride today that this will be a New England venture, without government funds, outside American banks or Japanese capital -- unlike new arenas under construction in Phoenix, Chicago or Tampa, Fla.
Last December the only banks interested in financing the new arena were Fuji Bank and Tokyo Trust, both of Japan, according to Lawrence C. Moulter, president of the New Boston Garden Corporation, which also is owned by Delaware North.
Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, a former college basketball star who once had a tryout with the Celtics, said he was pleased not only that the new Garden would lift the region's economy but also that "it will be done by our own banks."
 
700 Construction Jobs
 Mr. Flynn and Gov. William F. Weld, who both attended this morning's announcement ceremony, estimated that building the new Garden would create 700 construction jobs, at a time when huge numbers of construction workers have been laid off here.
It will also provide Boston's first large modern building for rock concerts and conventions, which they estimated would generate $350 million a year in new spending.
The old Garden, built in 1928, is a grimy structure without air-conditioning or escalators.
Mr. Auerbach joked about it today. "I've been here since 1950 and we always had a competitive edge," he said. "Lousy dressing rooms, the heat off in winter, too hot in June, all the dead spots on the floor. Now all our advantages are going to be gone, so I have mixed emotions about this."
The new arena will be built just behind the old Garden, above an underground parking garage and railroad tracks going into a new North Station.
While the new Garden will certainly be modern, it may still not be comfortable for visiting basketball teams. "The old parquet floor comes with us," said Mr. Moulter.

HEADLINE: Ecological Plea From Executives

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 7

 BODY:
Hoping to influence the outcome of next month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, a group of powerful international business leaders, including top American executives, called today for greater environmental awareness from governments and private businesses.
The group said business executives had to start addressing environmental issues to survive. 
 The group, organized by a maverick Swiss billionaire, Stephan Schmidheiny, issued a report today called "Changing Course," the result of more than 20 months of debate in the United States, Europe and Japan.
 
Linking Environment to Business
 The report argues that environmental and business efficiency are inextricably linked and that the most successful companies in the future will be those that are most "eco-efficient," because good ecological behavior uses fewer resources, generates less waste and pollution and produces more profits.
In what is likely to be the most controversial proposition, the group proposes changes in use and prices of energy. It proposes a value-added tax on energy -- as the European Community wants -- and an end to price subsidies for coal and electricity in many countries and to tax breaks for travel such as commuting.
The group also embraces a longstanding demand of environmentalists by recommending that the prices of all goods and services gradually be adjusted to reflect environmental costs -- the cost of production, use, recycling and disposal. Because such costs were not integrated in prices by government and business in the past, it says, industrialization has generally been characterized by depletion of resources and high levels of pollution.
 
Report Given to Bush
 Mr. Schmidheiny and other corporate chiefs gave a copy of the report to President Bush on Monday. Several chief executives at the presentation in Geneva today said they had pressed Mr. Bush for the United States to take a leading role in Rio.
"Our message to the President was that we hoped U.S. leadership will be reflected in what happens in Rio," said Frank Popoff, the president and chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company.
The group stopped short of saying they had urged the President to attend the United Nations-sponsored Rio summit, which is expected to approve broad actions to create fundamental changes in world economic and environmental behavior.
"Essentially we told President Bush, 'You have allies in a camp where you may not have expected them, that is, allies who support more environmental efficiency,' " Mr. Schmidheiny said.
Members of the group, which consists of 48 leading industrialists and is called the Business Council for Sustainable Development, plan to attend the Rio Earth Summit next month to promote their ideas and present a declaration signed by all of them.
It is the first time such high-level business chiefs have raised their voice as a group in the worldwide environmental debate.
"It has been a pioneering effort," said Mr. Schmidheiny of the work of the group, which includes such American chief executives as Kenneth Derr of Chevron, Paul O'Neill of Alcoa, Edgar Woolard of Du Pont, and Samuel Johnson, chairman of Johnson Wax.
Participants from Japan are Akira Miki, chairman of Nippon Steel; Shinroku Morohashi, chairman of Mitsubishi, and Yutaka Kume, president of Nissan Motor. From Europe, the list includes Carl Hahn of Volkswagen and Lodewyk van Wachem of Royal Dutch Shell.
Study of energy use in the former Soviet Union, the United States and Japan shows that low energy prices make consumers less concerned about the efficiency of products, the report says, adding that "the time has come for energy prices to reflect full environmental and economic costs."
The council argues that business executives are under a rising tide of pressures from government regulations, laws, environmental groups, stockholders, employees, consumers, banks and insurance companies.
"Banks are more willing to lend to clean companies, and insurance companies are more prone to cover clean companies," Mr. Schmidheiny said.
Mr. Schmidheiny, who is 45 years old, has sizable interests in Swiss makers of scientific instruments and watches, and in engineering and trading companies. He founded the council in the summer of 1990 after he was approached by Maurice Strong, a Canadian millionaire who is the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio.
Mr. Schmidheiny said Mr. Strong had asked him to provide the business perspective for the conference and to stimulate business interest around the world. Since then the Swiss businessman has traveled the globe and met with 15 heads of state and many business leaders on his "mission of common sense."
 
'Not Just a Fad'
 "It takes not much imagination to see that environmental concern is not just a fad, but a serious trend," he said in an interview today. "It will shape the future of our business, and to learn to understand it and shape it is really in our interest."
Mr. Schmidheiny and other members of the council said they were convinced that changes would come as a result of environmental awareness. "We have two options: either we resist and we will suffer, or we anticipate the changes and we will have more profits and more personal satisfaction," he said.
By going on the offensive rather than resist change, he argues, business leaders "will have the chance to promote self-regulation, provided we do it in time, we do it convincingly and in a transparent way. If we fail to do it in time, we face government regulations under pressure from the public."
Mr. Popoff of Dow Chemical said that United States Government support for the agreements to be proposed in Rio would be beneficial for his company in the long run. "We need to harmonize environmental issues and rules," he said.
The report addresses a range of issues including trade, population trends, the need for new accounting principles for pricing the environment and the need for the transfer of technology to developing nations which, it says, is best handled on a company-to-company basis.
The Business Council has not set targets like dates or levels to control environmental emissions and waste, saying that such targets will be set by politicians. As for the financing for the changes it envisions, it says that business executives will provide financing and investment to reach "eco-efficiency."
The report has already drawn fire from business critics and environmentalists. Greenpeace International, the environmental organization, said today that the report was a "veiled attempt to minimize international environmental controls."

HEADLINE: How a Union Won an Appalachian Struggle

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RAVENSWOOD, W.Va., May 1

 BODY:
In early April, Caterpillar's mere threat to put 12,600 strikers out of their jobs for good drove the workers back to the assembly lines in Peoria, Ill. They returned on the company's terms while a new contract is negotiated, and they had nothing but wrath and unpaid bills to show for five months of picketing.
At Caterpillar, as at more and more unionized companies, management has found that to stop labor disputes it can simply replace workers. But in this dowdy, one-stoplight hamlet of 4,200 in the Ohio River Valley, the United Steelworkers of America has shown that a union can still break an employer. 
 The employer is the Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation. To end what it calls a strike and the workers call a lockout, the company capitulated. The chairman and chief executive, the man who had replaced his 1,700 workers, was dismissed. Two associates also left.
The company's owners called for new negotiations. The steelworkers union expects most of its workers to be back on the job soon and the 1,000 or so replacement workers to be removed.
 
At Least, a Sign of Hope
 Labor leaders say most unions are not as rich as the United Steelworkers, and most managements do not make the easy target that Ravenswood Aluminum did. They say the chairman's dismissal does not mean that labor has found an answer to replacement workers. But they say it does show that unions are not necessarily doomed to lose every big battle.
In Ravenswood, the steelworkers union had made the struggle with the chairman, R. Emmett Boyle, as crucial a test as the United Automobile Workers had made the battle in Peoria.
The United Steelworkers went a long way to help a local under siege. It provided much of the members' food. It paid their utility bills and in many cases their rents and mortgages. More important, it put the company's business, already ailing in the recession, at risk by inducing major customers like Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola to stop buying Ravenswood aluminum or face boycotts by pro-union consumers.
Finally, it exposed Mark Rich, a billionaire commodities dealer living as a fugitive in Switzerland, as the power behind Mr. Boyle. And it dispatched emissaries to foreign banks and governments to call attention to Mr. Rich's designation by Forbes Magazine as a "champion sleaze" and discourage their doing business with him.
The union had another edge in Ravenswood: the local members, mostly hardy Appalachian folk, 53 years old on average, many sons and daughters of coal miners, with a Depression-era respect for unions.
Steelworkers Local 5668 says only 17 members of about 1,700 gave in to management's invitation to return to their jobs over the 18 months of the work stoppage. By contrast, in the final days of the five-month strike in Peoria, when the management at Caterpillar said it would hire permanent replacements, several hundred crossed the picket lines.
"We're isolated in this valley here," said Ken Dean, one of three brothers, all in their 50's, who worked at the plant. "We have more togetherness than you do in larger cities."
Management and the union disagree over whether the workers voluntarily went out on strike, making them ineligible for unemployment benefits of roughly $200 a week, or whether Mr. Boyle locked them out. Though some issues are still to be decided, the State of West Virginia has agreed that the dispute is a lockout, and therefore has been paying unemployment benefits.
At midnight on Oct. 31, 1990, the union's last contract expired. During the previous month, the company had proposed a new one that changed seniority rules, eliminated the cost-of-living adjustment the workers received if consumer-price increases exceeded 3 percent a year, and eliminated additional pay when the price of aluminum went high enough to create generous profits for the company.
Charles McDowell, a top officer of Local 5668, says the company refused to negotiate in any detail. Management says the union balked at all its proposals. The company declared the talks stalemated and, the union says, workers were told to pick up their tools and go home minutes before the contract expired. The company brought in its first replacement crew, 100 workers whom it had recruited weeks before and trained at a nearby motel.
The National Labor Relations Board has accused the company of a lockout and several other violations of fair-labor practices. The former management asserts that a board administrative judge will rule in its favor eventually, and that Mr. Rich and the people close to him should have held out. "If we had stayed the course, we would have won the judge's ruling," said Debbie Boger, the former vice president of administration who left with Mr. Boyle.
Mr. Boyle and Ms. Boger have other aluminum businesses that they manage from Wheeling, W. Va. She said Mr. Boyle was not at liberty to comment.
 
Tracing a Long Decline
 Organized labor attributes the long erosion of its membership and power in part to the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the first to condone business's use of permanent replacement workers. A strike, normally a union's ultimate weapon, usually succeeds in forcing compromises, and tempers usually subside because each side can claim to have won something.
But unions say employers who hire permanent replacements gain a huge advantage. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded 40 stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers last year, compared with hundreds each year in the three decades before the 1980's. Unions say the decline of their influence is one reason why wages, which soared in the 1950's and 1960's, are no higher now in buying power than they were in the early 1970's.
Unions are pressing for legislation, so far opposed by President Bush, to ban the use of replacement workers in strikes. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the probable Democratic nominee for President, supports such legislation.
Joe Uehlein, special projects director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and an adviser to the steelworkers here, said using permanent replacements can stretch out labor disputes for years, impoverishing employers as well as unions. Indeed, it is an open question whether Ravenswood Aluminum can recover from its losses in the stoppage.
 
The Cost of Preparing
 One illustration of the cost of using replacement workers is the extreme to which the company went to prepare for a strike.
The company occupies hundreds of acres stretching almost a mile along the Ohio River in the rural outskirts of town. At first, the complex looks like any modern industrial site -- low, windowless, gray and blue buildings with chimneys, asphalt and labyrinths of pipe. But closer up, it looks like a medium-security prison.
Two and three rows of eight-foot-high chain-link fence topped with barbed wire surround the principal plants: a reduction factory, where ore is melted and converted to ingots, and a fabrication plant, where the ingots are rolled into coils of aluminum sheet, much of which eventually ends up as beer and soft-drink cans.
Tall, thick steel plates have been installed in front of the electric power transformers. Television cameras are mounted on the corners of the buildings, and security men in Army boots and midnight-blue battle fatigues man the gatehouses.
 
Living Where They Work
 In the first weeks of the struggle, management nailed plywood over all the windows of its administration building. For three weeks everyone there was required to stay put, day and night, sleeping on cots.
There has been only one serious injury related to the conflict over the 18 months: a security guard lost an eye in a shooting, although the origin of the bullet is in dispute. A company spokesman, Patrick M. Gallagher, said there had been "thousands" of incidents.
Mr. Boyle became chairman in 1989, when he, an associate of Mr. Rich and another investor bought the companyfrom the Kaiser Aluminum Corporation. In the 31 years that Kaiser owned the business, the only work stoppages were a few wildcat strikes of less than a week, and Kaiser never invited replacement workers to take the jobs of strikers. But when Ravenswood Aluminum did, the company jarred an Appalachian sense of fair play.
"It's basic honesty," said Dan Fewell, 45, one of the replaced workers. "You don't go and steal a man's car. You don't go and steal a man's job."
 
Sustained by Faith
 Religion in this community -- the Yellow Pages list 18 churches, or 1 for every 230 residents -- seems to have helped sustain the workers. "I'd say we're far above average as far as God-fearing people," said Richard C. Johnson, 52, a millwright.
Jim Derrick, 62, a welder who conducts prayer services at the union hall, said: "I just talk to the Lord. He tells me to forget about it. He'll take care of my needs. Not my wants. My needs."
A knack for getting by in the state that leads the nation in unemployment also helps. "A country boy can survive," Mike Asbury, 42, said. "We can grow potatoes and beans. We can go shoot a deer."
Vera Smith, whose husband, James, is an equipment operator, was one of the Ravenswood women who lobbied the state legislature for better plant safety. In December, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration assessed the company one of its highest penalties ever, $604,500 for safety violations.
"This had turned into a real unsafe plant," Mrs. Smith said. Five men died there in the 18 months before the strike. The union says only one died in the years of Kaiser's stewardship.
 
Working 'Like a Mule'
 After Mr. Boyle took over, supervisors started driving the workers harder and forcing many to work double shifts, said Mark Hager, a 32-year-old plant worker. "It's a tough enough job anyway, with outrageous temperatures," he said. "But they started raw-dogging you and working you like a mule."
The union appears to have provoked Mr. Boyle's dismissal by going after Mr. Rich; the union believes Mr. Boyle reported to him. Mr. Rich fled the country nine years ago under indictment on charges of tax evasion, racketeering and trading oil with Iran during the embassy-hostage crisis, when the Government ordered an embargo.
Ravenswood Aluminum is privately held, so few details of its business need be disclosed publicly. But the union says that abundant circumstantial evidence suggests that Mr. Rich controls the company through a close associate, Willy Strothotte. Mr. Strothotte, the union says, took over Mr. Boyle's 27 percent share in the company with Mr. Boyle's dismissal and now has at least 75 percent. The union says four other investors are closely connected to Mr. Rich and Mr. Strothotte. Mr. Gallagher insists that Mr. Rich has no "direct" interest in the company.
To put pressure on Mr. Boyle, the steelworkers union and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. went after Mr. Rich. They dispatched emissaries, including several from the plant, to Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Britain, Venezuela and Switzerland to lobby banks and governments not to do business with Mr. Rich.
Labor leaders think Mr. Rich wants to clean up his image. He has hired lawyers in Washington, presumably, union officials say, to make peace with the Justice Department so he can return to the United States. Peace in Ravenswood, they say, might help.

HEADLINE: Olympia Offers Stakes to Banks

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 7

 BODY:
Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the cash-short real estate giant, today offered its lending banks equity stakes in both its huge Canary Wharf development here and the parent company in return for debt-payment relief and new funds.
The meeting with 15 of Olympia's largest lenders on restructuring $12 billion in debts continued into the night and how the banks would respond was not clear. 
One pressing issue is whether the banks that have lent about 950 million ($1.71 billion) to the Canary Wharf office-development project in East London will provide additional money, which is needed for construction to continue. The 5 million ($8.5 million) they provided last week will reportedly run out in a matter of days and Olympia is believed to have asked for an additional 30 million ($53.9 million) to see it through the next month.
If Olympia does not get the money, Canary Wharf will probably be forced into bankruptcy, and the Olympia empire, which includes vast holdings in the United States and Canada, could crumble.
"We need funding fairly soon, and we are optimistic we will get it," Michael Dennis, the head of Canary Wharf, said at a news conference.
Bankers said today that most lenders to Canary Wharf were willing to provide more money but that there was at least one holdout: the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
The Olympia proposal calls for lenders to receive nonvoting stakes of up to 30 percent in the current phase of Canary Wharf and up to 20 percent in Olympia, which is owned by the Reichmann family of Toronto. This marks the first time the Reichmanns have been willing to share ownership -- but not control -- of the private company.
Under the proposed plan, Olympia would have the right to buy back the shares within seven years at a price determined by a set formula. If it did not, the banks could presumably sell their shares in the open market.
 
Called a 'Milestone'
 Gerald Greenwald, president of Olympia, and Robert S. Miller Jr., its financial adviser, announced the proposal at the news conference held during a break in their meeting with bankers at Canary Wharf.
Calling the offer "a significant milestone" in Olympia's history, Mr. Greenwald said Olympia was "inviting its lenders to join hands as partners in the business."
Asked how lenders could be considered equal partners if their shares lacked voting rights, Mr. Miller said that was not significant. "The actual agreements between the banks on how the company will be operated will be embedded in" new loan covenants, he said.
While he did not attend the news conference, Paul Reichmann, Olympia's leader, was at the meeting with the bankers, where the company presented a five-year business plan. The banks at the session included Citibank, Hongkong and Shanghai, Barclays, Credit Lyonnais, Canadian Imperial and Credit Suisse.
Bankers have been criticizing Olympia for providing outdated and inadequate financial information, and Mr. Greenwald indicated today that the bankers were not completely pacified by the latest information. "We know we haven't satisfied them yet, but we're moving quickly and we're certainly trying," he said.
 
Five-Year Extension
 The proposal by Olympia calls for most of its debt-principal payments to be extended for five years.
Interest payments on about $4 billion of the parent company's debt would be limited to the dividend and cash flow from the operations serving as collateral for the loans. Any shortfall would be paid in Olympia shares.
From what Mr. Miller said, it appeared that the banks that could end up owning as much as 30 percent of Canary Wharf were the 11 that had made 500 million ($898.2 million) in construction loans backed by the project's buildings.
The remaining 450 million in Canary Wharf loans came from a smaller group of banks, including four Canadian institutions.
Olympia is also asking for 300 million ($538.9 million) in new funds to complete the current phase of Canary Wharf. The vast majority of that space is completed or in an advance stage of construction, including the 812-foot tower that is Britain's tallest building.
 
Additional $700 million
 All in all, Olympia has asked banks for an additional $700 million for the Canadian and British operations, Mr. Miller said. "At this point," he added, Olympia does not think it will need additional credit lines in the United States.
Olympia is also seeking permission to draw the remaining $130 million of an existing $240 million credit line provided by Canadian banks.
The plan also calls for the sale of some assets, but Olympia officials did not identify them at the news conference. Earlier this week, Olympia announced plans to sell an 18 percent stake in the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, the American railroad and natural resources conglomerate, and a 63.5 interest in the Home Oil Company of Calgary, Alberta. The stakes could fetch more than $740 million.
When Olympia embarked on the Canary Wharf project in 1987, it planned to build 26 buildings with 10 million square feet of office space by 1997.
That was before the current recession hit Britain, and the developer now has tenant commitments for only 60 percent of the 4.6 million square feet. Mr. Dennis said Olympia would not proceed with further construction until most of the existing space had been let.
Mr. Miller said that "it will take weeks, if not a month or more," to reach a debt-restructuring agreement. That prediction, however, seemed to assume that the banks will react favorably to Olympia's proposal.

HEADLINE: DELIVERY DISPUTE;
Veteran Players Battle In News Drivers Fight

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
A New Jersey trucking magnate who once planned to build a grandiose new riverfront city on the Hudson across from Manhattan, and two iron-willed drivers' unions that have been linked by investigators to rackets and underworld mobs are the principal players in the high-stakes confrontation that has brought New York City's major newspapers to the brink of a labor war.
There are other players -- 1,000 members of a union that has delivered New York's newspapers since the turn of the century, whose jobs are jeopardized; and hundreds of newly hired members of a teamsters' local with no newspaper-delivery experience, who find themselves in a potentially bruising inter-union fight for jobs . 
 And, since the confrontation threatens strikes that could disrupt the distribution of The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post, The Wall Street Journal and many other publications, readers across the New York metropolitan region may also be drawn into the maelstrom.
The complex confrontation arose Wednesday when members of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union of New York and Vicinity rejected a series of proposed contracts covering drivers for four wholesale newspaper delivery companies -- two of them being acquired by The New York Times and two being bought by Arthur E. Imperatore, the trucking magnate.
The Times yesterday was considering an option to assign its agreement to buy the wholesalers to a third party, probably Mr. Imperatore. But Mr. Imperatore went ahead with his purchase and hired teamsters' union members in place of 210 newspaper union deliverers who had refused to accept lower terms. The teamsters' union represents drivers at his other trucking enterprises.
 
Complex Labor Fight
 Like many labor confrontations, this one pitted a powerful and determined management against strong-willed unionists. But it was also marked by unusual complexity, with two unions at odds over the same jobs. And it was noteworthy for the sheer toughness of the combatants: a self-made millionaire, a drivers' union that has seen leaders jailed for bribery, and a teamsters' local whose president currently stands charged with embezzlement.
Mr. Imperatore, a 64-year-old trucking and real estate entrepreneur who began as a truck driver and built a fortune estimated at $200 million, owns the APA Transpsort Corporation of North Bergen, N.J., which hauls freight everywhere in the East, and about 350 acres of prime waterfront real estate in Weehawken, N.J., across from Manhattan.
He bought the big parcel during the liquidation of the Penn Central's holdings in 1981 for a bargain price of $7.75 million -- a value that has multiplied many times in the years since. In succeeding years, Mr. Imperatore made plans to develop a $5 billion commercial and residential mini-city, a "Venice on the Hudson," that was to include 15,000 housing units, 10 million square feet of retail space and a yachtsman's paradise.
Mr. Imperatore got things moving by establishing a ferry service between Weehawken and Manhattan with a license from the New York City Department of Transportation. Anthony R. Ameruso, the Transportation Commissioner, was later indicted for perjury in a municipal scandal and it was disclosed that eight days after the ferry permit was granted he had invested $250,000 in a real estate company with ties to the company that got the permit. Mr. Ameruso withdrew the investment and Mr. Imperatore denied any connection between it and the permit.
 
Agreement in Principle
 Meanwhile, the recession and other problems upset the timetable for the mini-city project, and Mr. Imperatore opened a golf driving range and miniature golf course on the land. Last November, expanding into yet another business, Mr. Imperatore agreed to buy Newspaper Distributors Company of East Farmingdale, L.I., which serves Long Island, and Westfair Newspaper Distributors in New Rochelle, N.Y., which serves Westchester County and Fairfield County in Connecticut.
In February, The Times agreed in principle to buy the two other major news wholesalers in the area -- Metropolitan News, which distributes in the city, and Newark Newsdealers Supply Company, which serves north and central New Jersey.
Under an asset sale, a buyer is not bound by existing contracts unless it specifically states that they survive a sale. Drivers were upset at the prospect of losing good wages -- most earn at least $40,000 and some with overtime as much as $100,000 -- and benefits.
But faced with a loss of jobs, their leaders negotiated new contracts last month giving concessions on staffing levels, work rules and overtime in exchange for job guarantees. But members rejected the agreements, setting the stage for the battle.
The drivers' union, which was born in horse-and-buggy days in 1901, has a history tainted with corruption, father-son nepotism and rules that kept blacks and Hispanic drivers out of its ranks for decades. But it also has struggled to improve its hiring practices and to bring security and a decent life to a membership that now totals about 2,900.
 
Cold, Lonely Nights
 Heavy traffic, cold nights and bad weather are the regular companions of drivers, who often work two on a truck. Because many work at night to deliver morning newspapers, they see their families only at odd hours or on days off, which are often in midweek and not consecutive.
The fiercely independent drivers' union never joined the powerful International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In recent decades, a dozen leaders of the drivers' union, including Carl Levy, who was president from 1969 to 1976, and Douglas LaChance, who was president from 1976 to 1980 and is currently the president again, were convicted of accepting illegal payoffs to assure labor peace. Mr. LaChance spent five years in prison.
Law-enforcement officials say a new investigation of the union has found evidence of underworld influence and various crimes, but Mr. LaChance, who has not been implicated, has denied the allegations.
The union that has emerged as the potential rival of the drivers is Local 917 of the teamsters, which has its headquarters in Manhattan and represents freight truck drivers, automobile mechanics and helpers at gasoline stations, parking attendants, automobile transporters and warehousemen in the metropolitan area.
Under a broad rackets investigation undertaken with the consent of the teamsters' union to root out corruption, Local 917's president, John T. Burke Jr., was charged last year with embezzlement of union funds. A ruling is pending.

HEADLINE: Top Executives Say Recovery Has Begun

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., May 7

 BODY:
Top executives from a dozen of the nation's largest corporations said this evening that with the exception of riot-torn Los Angeles, the United States appeared to have begun a slow recovery from last year's recession.
All the executives who spoke this evening thought that an economic recovery had begun, but they differed on whether its progress was assured. The most optimistic was Robert E. Allen, the chairman and chief executive of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. "I don't think we're going to have a booming recovery, but I think it may exceed most economists' expectations," he said. 
 One of the most pessimistic executives was John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company, who said that while the long-term competitiveness of American industry was improving, the recovery appeared to have been less strong last month than in the three preceding months.
 
No Enthusiasm for Cities
 However, none of the executives expressed any enthusiasm when asked if they had any immediate interest in investing in inner cities. After a moment of silence, Walter V. Shipley, the president and chief operating officer of the Chemical Banking Corporation, pointed out that some areas in Newark and Washington that were damaged in riots years ago had never been rebuilt.
Howard P. Allen, chairman of the executive committee of the Southern California Edison Company, said that until the riots his region had appeared to be slowly following the rest of the country into recovery. But a significant pause is likely now before tourism and investment recover.
"The riots put a cloud not only on other things but on the economy of the Southern California area," Mr. Allen said.
The answer, Mr. Allen said, was a national experiment in creating free enterprise zones, cultural centers and other programs in Los Angeles to persuade businesses that investments there would be safe and at least somewhat profitable. With such assurances, businesses might be willing to invest even for returns below those available elsewhere, Mr. Allen insisted.
 
More Jobs Are Needed
 Mr. Welch said that businesses' main response to the riots should be to create more jobs and increase the diversity of the American work place.
Mr. Welch heads the Business Council, a group of 100 chief executives of large corporations who are meeting here over the next two days to discuss the economy and foreign trade. Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, will address the group Friday in an effort to rally support for the Administration's attempts to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico and a global free-trade pact.
The chief executives spoke after reviewing a very cautious report on the nation's economy by chief economists from 19 large corporations. The economists' views are important not only as an indication of the economy's direction, but also because they influence the assumptions being made by America's corporate leaders as they decide whether to expand investment and other spending this year or remain cautious.
 
Slow, Halting Progress
 The recession appears to have ended last year, they said, but the recovery will be slow and halting, and the economies of other industrialized countries are growing more slowly than expected last autumn.
The weakening of the Japanese, German and other European economies is hurting American exports.
But the economists also drew some optimism from the steep fall in interest rates late last year, the wider availability of credit and, above all, increasing consumer confidence.
They predicted 2.5 percent economic growth through the rest of this year. The prediction, "is faster than the meager growth actually achieved during the past year," the economists said in their report to the chief executives. "But it remains well below the pace typical of previous economic recoveries."

HEADLINE: Rise Seen In Lending By Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 7

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said today that the ill effects on the economy from bankers' reduced willingness to extend new loans was abating.
While standing by his comments earlier this year that weakness in the financial system, including banks, was hurting the economy, Mr. Greenspan said the regulators were not to blame. He said the tougher financial standards for banks did not cause banks to reduce business lending and instead to increase their holdings of government securities sharply. Rather, he said, that trend "reflects mainly weak loan demand." 
 Although the economy and bank lending habits are not back to normal, Mr. Greenspan said, "Things are improving." He said the stronger financial condition of businesses, consumers and banks would bode well for future economic growth.
Mr. Greenspan's comments, made at a conference here sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, appeared to counter critics in Congress who attribute the weakness in bank lending to regulators' rules, which do not count investments in government securities when calculating a bank's capital requirement, but do count all business loans.
The Fed chairman noted that tougher capital requirements were imposed on banks at about the time the economy turned down, and added that banks traditionally increased securities purchases when loan demand slackened. He said that another reason for the drop in bank loans was that some businesses had raised money to repay loans by selling more stock or issuing long-term bonds.
Mr. Greenspan also took a broad swipe at the banking law approved last year, saying that it is so restrictive that it could harm the economy.
He also strongly implied that when it came to writing the scores of regulations to enforce the act, he intended to promote looser regulations on everything from compensation and loans to bankers to record-keeping, lending and capital standards.
The new law, he said, "requires the agencies to establish highly undesirable regulations that involve substantial micro-management" and puts the Government perilously close to being in the business of "credit allocation," referring to decisions about whom banks lend to and in what amounts.
 
Not the Government's Job
 "Credit allocation is -- and I fervently hope will remain -- the job of bankers, not Government," he said.
Mr. Greenspan has long sought legislation to make it easier and cheaper for banks to enter the securities and insurance industries. Congress rejected such legislation last year. It had been proposed by the Administration, but fell victim to a heavy lobbying campaign against it by community bankers and securities and insurance interests.
Instead, Congress adopted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, which gave regulators the authority to borrow billions of dollars from the Treasury to bail out insolvent banks and generally tightened restrictions on the industry. The Federal Reserve and the other bank regulatory agencies have begun writing dozens of regulations to enforce the Act.
"We must work to be sure that all of these provisions are implemented in a way that preserves the decision-making role of bankers," Mr. Greenspan said, "while permitting agencies to identify institutions that take what would be widely agreed are excessive risks or engage in inappropriate practices."
 
Glimmer of More Demand
 David J. Vitale, executive vice-president at the First National Bank of Chicago noted that "there are glimmerings of improved loan demand" as more companies are talking about their credit needs with the bank, although they are not yet increasing their borrowings.
Mr. Vitale, who attended the conference, said in an interview that he expected that when lending increases, it might not increase the size of the Chicago bank. Like many other large banks, First Chicago has been an active seller of loans to reduce the amount of capital it needs to satisfy regulatory requirements.
Mr. Vitale said that capital requirements would probably rise for large banks that are active in the securities and foreign exchange markets and in selling interest rate swaps and options on interest rates and currencies. "They may not require the additional capital all at once, but my gut feeling is that when regulators have an opportunity to require more capital, they will," Mr. Vitale said.
Mr. Greenspan said American regulators would probably issue early this summer proposals for capital requirements based on the risks banks face from fluctuating interest rates.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Reporter's Notebook;
Bill Clinton, Crusading Cub Reporter

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., May 7

 BODY:
Sometimes, as Bill Clinton's political caravan jumps from state to state in a frenetic quest for votes and publicity, it seems that television news correspondents are as important as the candidate himself, or more so.
Since inspecting the damage from the riots in Los Angeles on Monday, Mr. Clinton has been trying to engage President Bush in a debate over social welfare policy. The debate is conducted not through speeches or manifestoes, but through an exchange of "sound bites." Journalists ask Mr. Clinton, the likely Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party, for his reaction to some statement by the Bush Administration, and within hours Mr. Clinton's comments are broadcast across the country, often provoking, in turn, a reply from the White House. 
 The importance of television news to the campaign was reflected in a witty parody performed aboard Mr. Clinton's plane as the Arkansas Governor flew back to Little Rock from Charleston, W.Va., on Wednesday.
In a reversal of roles, Governor Clinton and the press secretary for his campaign, Dee Dee Myers, interviewed Gene Randall, a correspondent for the Cable News Network who has been following the campaign since early this year.
Mr. Clinton and Ms. Myers posed as television journalists, and Mr. Randall played the role of candidate. "This is the most important interview our fledgling network has ever done," said Governor Clinton, who described Mr. Randall as "a major figure in our time."
Among the questions posed to Mr. Randall by Ms. Myers were these: "Is it true you wore the same necktie the previous six days in a row?" (Yes.) "Is it true you don't sit in your assigned seat here on the plane every day?" (True.) "Can you name three areas where you disagree with Ted Turner," the founder of the Cable News Network? ("No, I can't," Mr. Randall replied tactfully.)
At the conclusion of the interview, Governor Clinton said: "Gene has done a wonderful job of evading every question. I think that this man has been so evasive, so slick in his evasion, that I have decided to withdraw in his favor. He should be President of the United States. Let's hear it for Randall for President."
 
Oratory, Loud and Clear
 In the antiseptic corridors of Washington, Federal officials are debating the merits of Great Society programs begun in the 1960's by President Lyndon B. Johnson. But in the hills and hollows of West Virginia, where there is chronic high unemployment, people love those programs, and Mr. Clinton's visit to Charleston was the occasion for full-throated old-fashioned Democratic oratory.
West Virginia holds a Presidential primary on Tuesday. Governor Clinton attended a rally with hundreds of people at the National Guard Armory on Coonskin Road in Charleston, the state capital. Behind the stage was a huge American flag.
Warming up the crowd, Cecil E. Roberts, vice president of the United Mine Workers of America, compared George Bush to Herbert Hoover. "Hoover believed in the trickle-down theory of economics," Mr. Roberts shouted at the top of his lungs. "That didn't work in 1929, and it don't work today. That caused a Depression in 1929. Down here in the coal fields of West Virginia, there's a depression again, and we are sick of it."
Mr. Clinton was not the first choice of organized labor, but he won over the crowd Wednesday in West Virginia by emphasizing the parts of his platform that correspond to the old-time religion of the Democratic Party.
Mr. Clinton was introduced by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, who said: "I am probably not one of the world's leading experts on growing up poor, but Bill Clinton did. He's with us, folks. He understands us."
Despite the differences in their economic backgrounds, Governor Clinton likened himself to Mr. Rockefeller, a former Governor of West Virginia, saying: "We are both seriously over-married. We've learned to live with it with as much humility as possible." Neither Hillary Clinton, a lawyer, nor Sharon Percy Rockefeller, the president of a public television station in the Washington area, attended the rally.
 
Love Him Tender
 "Clinton: Young Man in a Hurry" is the title of a new book that appeared this week in Little Rock bookstores. It is a pastiche of facts, anecdotes and impressions of the Governor, culled from people who have known him over the last 45 years.
The authors, Jim Moore, who grew up in western Arkansas and now lives in Hillsboro, Tex., and Rick Ihde portray Mr. Clinton as a progressive force in a politically backward state.
The book, published by the Summit Group of Fort Worth and on sale for $22.95, discloses that one of young Billy Clinton's favorite pastimes was "to cruise around Hot Springs doing impersonations of Elvis Presley." Mr. Clinton is reported to have done an especially good rendition of "Love Me Tender."
Mr. Moore also reports that Billy liked to experiment with various foods. "Peanut butter and bananas constituted his favorite sandwich creation during his high school years," the book says.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Perot Hires Businessman To Be Issues Coordinator

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 7

 BODY:
Ross Perot, who said this week he would step back from public forums to study policy positions for a likely Presidential campaign, has hired a business executive with broad connections in the Federal Government to head his effort.
John P. White, general manager since 1989 of the computer-based products division at the Eastman Kodak Company, took an indefinite leave from the company in Rochester earlier this week to join the slowly-widening circle of Perot advisers in North Dallas, said a Kodak spokesman, Ron Roberts. 
 "Issue coordinator" is the best description of Mr. White's assignment, although he has not been given a title, said James Squires, a spokesman for the Perot Petition Campaign. "The real function is to line up and assemble for Mr. Perot the various experts and all the information that we can possibly get to him."
Mr. White did not respond to a request for an interview that was left on his answering machine at the Perot office. Mr. White, 54 years old, helped convert the nation's military from a draft system to an all-volunteer force as an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the first years of the Carter Administration. He later transferred to Deputy Director at the Office of Management and Budget, where he was responsible for budgets at the Pentagon as well as the State, Treasury and Labor Departments.
Before entering government, he rose quickly as a research economist in the Rand Corporation, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif. He analyzed transportation issues and Air Force manpower and training programs after joining Rand as a research economist in 1968. He was later named a senior vice president and trustee.
Returning to Santa Monica in 1981, Mr. White was chairman and chief executive of a software-development company, the Interactive Systems Corporation, until Kodak acquired the company in 1988.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Bond Sale Goes Well

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
An auction of $10 billion worth of 29 1/2-year bonds, the final part of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions, went well yesterday.
Despite the successful auction, traders began to sell securities after the auction results were announced as a defense against the chance that April employment data, to be released today, would show unexpected strength. 
 Concern that the employment figures might show that the economy was growing faster than currently anticipated were alleviated somewhat late yesterday when the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week that ended on April 27.
 
Unexpectedly Large Drops
 The declines in the monetary aggregates were much larger than expected, especially a $9.7 billion drop in M-2, the money measure followed most closely by the Fed.
The drop in M-2 put its growth since the fourth quarter below the low end of the Fed's target range for the growth of that category this year of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent .
Prices of outstanding bonds and notes came off their lows after the money numbers were released, and closed little changed on the day.
Analysts said the weak money report seemed to increase the chances the Fed may choose to cut short-term interest rates again soon.
"Unless money supply, which is a leading economic indicator, reverses recent weakness over the next two to three weeks, it would be increasingly likely that the Fed will ease," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago.
"And the decline in money supply will probably take some of the sting out of an unusually strong employment report, if that happens," he added.
In advance of the employment report, most Wall Street economists were forecasting that nonfarm payroll employment rose by between 50,000 and 75,000 jobs last month. An increase of that size would be consistent with the sluggish, halting recovery most analysts say is unfolding.
The money supply report partly overshadowed the Treasury bond auction, which was the concluding piece of what turned out to be a highly successful quarterly refunding for the Treasury.
At the auction, the bonds were sold at an average yield of 8 percent, up from an average of 7.91 percent at the last bond sale on Feb. 13.
 
Existing Issue 'Reopened'
 Rather than issue a new bond, the Treasury chose to "reopen" an existing issue -- the 8 percent bonds of November 2021 -- that were originally sold in November 1991. The decision was made because current market conditions were not conducive to a new issue.
It was the first time since 1984 that the Treasury had chosen to reopen an outstanding bond more than once. The reopening created a huge, $32 billion issue.
"Even though this is the third time the Street has bid for this issue, there was surprisingly good demand," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Given the fact that the bonds have a record floating supply and that the employment report is imminent, this was an excellent auction."
 
Outstanding Issues Rise
 As Mr. Kahan suggested, the money supply report did seem to allay traders' concerns about the employment statistics, because prices of outstanding notes and bonds moved higher late in the session.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 3/8, down 1/32 , to yield 7.96 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 10019/32 , down 1/32 , to yield 6.73 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/4, down 1/32 , to yield 5.24 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.58 percent late yesterday, unchanged from late Wednesday. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 3.70 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late rate of 3.99 percent.
 
High-Yield Issue
 Activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by a $400 million offering of high-yield securities issued by the Adelphia Communicactions Corporation.
The 12.50 percent senior notes mature in 2002 and were priced at $100, or par.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which, because of heavy demand, was increased in size from $275 million.
The securities are rated B-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and B by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was sluggish, traders said, partly because of the Treasury's refunding auctions.
Prices of most investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged on the day, according to market participants. And municipal bond traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point.

New York's transit agency says lawyers are taking it for a very expensive ride.

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
Of all the feelings one can muster for the New York City Transit Authority, solidarity must be pretty low on the list. But that is precisely what the organization is seeking to foster these days, by choosing a target even less popular than the Broadway Local at rush hour: lawyers.
"LAWSUIT ABUSE!" shriek the more than 20,000 posters that began popping up on the city's buses and subways in March. "Guess who picks up the tab? You do!" This month the notices, now found alongside advertisements for acne specialists and beauty academies, will spread to Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road. 
 Every year, 3,000 new claims are made against the authority, and it pays out $50 million in damages. That is to say nothing of the cost of paying 125 staff members, including 50 lawyers, to handle such suits, which are especially tempting in bad economic times. "People view it as a chance to hit the lottery," said the authority's executive general counsel for torts, Wallace D. Gossett.
Transit officials say they hope strap-hangers who are tempted to take on the much-maligned agency will realize that the deep pocket they are digging into is actually their own. They add that they hope to cultivate a new crop of whistle-blowers, who will report instances of fraud to them.
There are plenty of legitimate beefs with the T.A., including 145 claims stemming from last year's fatal accident at the 14th Street station. At the same time, there are at least some people who hobble into court asserting they have suffered crippling injuries, only to be spotted later changing tires or painting houses or running marathons, sometimes with their lawyers jogging alongside them.
At first blush, weeding out such fraud seems as beyond reproach as Mother's Day. But personal injury lawyers say the effort is a particularly pernicious form of jury tampering. They assert that while the posters have been plastered everywhere, they seem to pop up more frequently in those subway stations closest to courthouses, where potential jurors are likely to see them.
Bert Bauman, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, saw one in the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn, directly beneath the State Supreme Court. "I saw it and I fumed because of the poison that it instills in the minds of jurors," he said. "Every juror gets off at that stop."
He took his gripe to the New York Law Journal. In a recent letter to the publication, he wrote, "The ad suggests that jurors should microscopically scrutinize each plaintiff's case to a greater extent than the court might charge them to; all plaintiffs are tarred with the same brush of presumptive fraud." Mr. Gossett called his charges "absolutely ridiculous."
An even sorer subject for the trial lawyers is the sponsor of the campaign: the American Tort Reform Association, a consortium of corporations, insurance companies and trade associations that include Dow Chemical, the Boy Scouts of America and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. The tort reform group supplied the posters, which cost $10,000 to produce. The authority donated the space and labor.
Last year, a similar campaign in Philadelphia reduced new claims against the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority by 18 percent. At least four more cities are considering similar efforts, while placards declaring "Put the Brakes on Fakes" will appear on all buses in Richmond later this month. The group has also had hundreds of thousands of "Lawsuit Abuse" bumper stickers printed.
The Philadelphia campaign aroused barely a whimper from personal injury lawyers there. But as Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential contender, discovered not long ago, the rules of engagement are slightly different in New York.
Mr. Bauman asserted that it was improper for a public agency to give free space to an interest group to advance a partisan message. After consulting with the American Trial Lawyers Association, he said he had decided not to challenge the advertisements on constitutional grounds, but he said he might go to court to demand equal time and space.
The tort reform group's president, Martin F. Connor, complained to the National Law Journal, "Here we are protesting litigiousness, and he wants to sue."
Mr. Bauman said he had little use for the phonies and frauds of the bar. "Take away their licenses, for all I care," he said. But he called the alliance between the authority and the tort reform group "outrageous" and "an impermissible use of public funds."
"I'm looking around for a good firm of attorneys to take this on pro bono," he said. Thus far, he added, there have been no volunteers within the trial lawyers group, which has nearly 4,000 members.

HEADLINE: Trenton Sees Budget Gap Of Millions

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 7

 BODY:
State Treasurer Samuel F. Crane said today that lower-than-expected revenue from the state income tax has left a $342 million gap in the state budget just seven weeks before the end of the current fiscal year.
Mr. Crane projected an additional $310 million revenue loss from a $15.7 billion budget proposed by Gov. Jim Florio for the next fiscal year. 
 The announcement will further complicate the effort by the Legislature's Republican majority to roll back the sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent at a cost of $610 million in revenue.
At a news conference, Mr. Crane outlined a belt-tightening plan that he said would leave the state with a surplus at the end of the current fiscal year and next year despite the tax revenue shortfall.
 
'We Will Not Compromise'
 "While the lingering effects of the national recession require that we make these adjustments, we will not compromise on the Governor's budget priorities," he said. "Our budget proposals will continue to follow through on the Governor's commitment to property-tax relief, local school funding, college tuition stabilization and affordable mass transit."
The treasurer said Governor Florio's administration would take $207 million from a school aid fund and decrease the amount of office space the state leases to deal with the problem this year, all of which can be done administratively. But to close the projected gap for the 1993 fiscal year, which begins July 1, Mr. Florio, a Democrat, must depend on the Republican-controlled Legislature to agree to a host of legislation.
The chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, Robert E. Littell, and his counterpart in the Assembly, Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, issued the Republican response to Mr. Crane's announcement.
"We need time to analyze the revenue numbers as well as the remedies offered by the administration," they said in a joint statement. "We will be prepared to make a formal response on Tuesday."
Privately, however, some Republicans said Mr. Crane's announcement had set the stage for another round of fierce, partisan fighting.
 
A Pivotal Period
 Mr. Crane said he had briefed Mr. Littell and Mr. Frelinghuysen on the revised revenue figures only hours before his public announcement.
Last month was a pivotal reporting period in which to gauge the state's finances because of the April 15 state income-tax filing deadline.
Mr. Crane said income-tax collections were down by $350 million and the corporate tax fell short by $30 million, but both losses were partly offset by gains from other taxes for a net gap of $342 million from a budget of $15 million for this fiscal year.
"From what we see today, these figures will hold," he said.
The shortfall projected for the 1993 fiscal year is $310 million.
Mr. Crane said the administration hoped to cover the 1993 shortfall by cutting the state work force through attrition, adding a new five-digit Lotto game, and reducing the amount of leased office space, which currently costs the state $250 million a year.
But he said Mr. Florio would have to depend on the Republicans for the major money-saving or revenue-producing parts of the plan for 1993. They include a proposal to expand the current "cheater-beater" program against delinquent taxpayers.
Mr. Crane said the administration also proposes cutting $7.8 million from the subsidy it gives to N. J. Transit. Officials hope that money will be covered by increased ridership and lower gasoline prices.
But the most controversial idea would have the state expand and accelerate the phase-in of a plan to tap into the state's over-financed pension system to raise $278 million for the next fiscal year's budget.
Mr. Florio first made the proposal in his budget speech in January. After weeks of studying the idea, Republicans legislative leaders cautiously agreed, although bills to approve the change in the pension system have not reached the floor for a vote.
Despite warnings from Republican legislators that they intended to roll back the tax rate to 6 percent, Mr. Florio based his proposed $15.7 billion budget for the 1993 fiscal year on a 7 percent tax rate.
"We project a surplus at the end of fiscal year 1993 of $226 million, the same level as our original budget proposal in January," Mr. Crane said today.
He said he expected the state to end the current fiscal year with a surplus of $289 million. But he said that depended on $380 million in retroactive Medicaid payments from the Federal Government and $38 million in promised Federal transportation funds.

HEADLINE: Corporations Ask Bush to Lift Vietnam Ban

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Eight large United States corporations, among them four oil companies, asked President Bush today to lift restrictions on business with Vietnam and allow Americans to compete in its growing market.
"The United States economic sanctions with respect to Vietnam have become unilateral, with our allies and trade partners investing heavily and trading vigorously," said the letter from executives of Caterpillar, Boeing, Hunt Oil, Chevron, Amoco, Phillips Petroleum, Windmere, American International Group and the Coudert Brothers law firm. 
 "Accordingly," the letter continued, "the effect of the American embargo is not to deny Vietnam access to Western technology and financing, but rather to penalize U.S. companies to the benefit of foreign competitors. The United States is rapidly losing ground and is forfeiting to foreign competition a market where we could have a competitive edge."
The executives requested a White House meeting to press their case.
In April, after a trip to Vietnam by an Assistant Secretary of State, Richard Solomon, the Administration concluded that Hanoi was making greater efforts to solve the cases of Americans missing or unaccounted for since the Vietnam War, and permitted telephone service to resume.
At the same time it also allowed American businesses to sell goods of a humanitarian nature -- medicines, food and clothing -- to the Vietnamese. But all other trade is prohibited.

B.P.'s Earnings Plummet 82%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, May 7

 BODY:
British Petroleum's earnings fell 82 percent in the first quarter as the company felt the effects of the recession, lower oil prices and lower profit margins on sales of petroleum products and chemicals.
The company's results were made public in the United States through its subsidiary, BP America, based in Cleveland. 
 British Petroleum reported first-quarter income of 95 million, or $168 million, down from 521 million, or $922 million, a year earlier. At that time, oil prices were higher because of the Persian Gulf War.
Earnings per share came to 36 cents, down from $2.22 a year earlier.
Revenues were 654 million, or $1.16 billion, down from 1.01 billion, or $1.8 billion.
David Simon, deputy chairman and chief operating officer, said in a statement that B.P.'s business outlook in the months ahead "suggest trading conditions will be just as difficult as in the recent past."

HEADLINE: Dow Off 6.04 Ahead of Jobs Data Today

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks slipped yesterday in quiet trading, with Wall Street edgy ahead of key April employment figures that will provide a solid gauge of the economy's strength.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.04 points to close at 3,363.37, and losers narrowly outpaced gainers, 821 to 817, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Volume was a slight 168.9 million shares, evidence that many traders were unwilling to enter the market ahead of today's jobs report, which will offer the first official sign of the economy's performance last month.
"The bets have been placed," said one trader at a major Wall Street firm. "Now the wheel is spinning, and everyone is just waiting to see where the ball drops."
There have been numerous signs of the economy's slow comeback, but the question is whether the early signs -- higher retail sales, rising housing starts, healthier industrial production -- will mean more jobs. Employment growth is key to the strength of the rebound. If the job outlook stagnates, consumers might be reluctant to increase spending.
The market had also hoped in recent days that the Federal Reserve would ease credit, offering an insurance policy for the recovery. But so far the Fed has stood firm.
"The market is fractious, and at the moment, people are concerned whether short-term rates will go lower," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Reich & Company.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told bankers in Chicago that there was room for the economy to grow faster in the coming quarters as consumers, corporations and banks put their finances in shape.
"There is evidence that things are improving," Mr. Greenspan said. "But I would scarcely argue, however, that we are anywhere back to normal."
Retailers posted strong sales figures for April in what analysts called a sign consumers are emerging from their long hibernation to buy a broad range of goods. But weekly jobless claims edged higher, by 11,000, to 415,000 in late April, a sign the job market remains under pressure.
Economists expect the April unemployment rate will remain unchanged at 7.3 percent, and they expect that nonfarm payrolls will expand by 72,000.
"Everybody is being cautious in front of the numbers," said Ron Doran, director of institutional trading at C.L. King & Associates. "We are in a narrow range here, but the market has been acting really well."
Many retail stocks were active after stores reported April sales figures. Sears, Roebuck dropped 1 3/8, to 42, after its overall sales for the four weeks that ended May 2 dropped 3.9 percent. The Gap added 1 5/8, to 42 1/8, with April sales up 13 percent, relieving Wall Street fears of a slump for the store chain.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 0.94 to 415.85. The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.35 to 394.12.
The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.48 points to 229.08. The average share fell 8 cents.
The Nasdaq over-the-counter index fell 2.20 to 587.16. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 4,032.884, down 8.214 or 0.20 percent.

Amdahl Shifts Some Duties Among Its Top Executives

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 7

 BODY:
The Amdahl Corporation today promoted E. Joseph Zemke, its president and chief operating officer, to chief executive. Mr. Zemke, who is 51 years old, succeeds John C. Lewis, 56, who will continue as chairman.
Amdahl, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is a leading maker of I.B.M.-compatible mainframe computers. 
 Mr. Lewis, who had been chief executive since 1983, said in a statement that the promotion of Mr. Zemke was consistent with the company's management succession plan for expanding the responsibilities of senior executives as Amdahl grows and diversifies.
"I don't regard this as indicative of change," said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, a Phoenix-based consulting concern that follows the mainframe market. "This is nothing more than a natural succession and recognition of a guy who's done well for Amdahl.
"Joe has been the hands-on guy when it comes to operational management, while Lewis is largely strategic. Prior to Zemke coming on board, Lewis kind of wore both hats."
Mr. Zemke, who joined Amdahl in 1985 as chief operating officer and was named president in 1987, said in a telephone interview that he expected to take on additional responsibility for long-range strategy and would turn over some day-to-day operations to other executives.
"I've been pretty much running the company for the past 18 months, even though I didn't have the title," he said.
Like its two competitors in the mainframe business, I.B.M. and Hitachi Data Systems, Amdahl has experienced a decline in earnings because of the recession and the transition to a new generation of products.
Mr. Zemke said Amdahl shipped the first of its new products in the fourth quarter, shipped about 20 units in the second, and will ship in volume in the third.
"We are not completely through that, but are now very much on the up slope," he said, adding that he expects earnings growth to resume in the second half of the year.
 
Gaining Market Share
 So-called plug-compatible manufacturers, like Amdahl and Hitachi, offer mainframes that can replace I.B.M. machines without modification. The plug-compatibles have been gaining market share from I.B.M. for several years, primarily by offering lower prices, superior performance or new features in advance of I.B.M. Amdahl, for example, was the first to offer a complete mainframe version of Unix, the industry standard software popular on workstations.
Before coming to Amdahl, Mr. Zemke had been president and chief executive of Auto-Trol Technology, a computer-aided design and manufacturing company based in Denver. Before that, he had been with I.B.M. for 18 years in a variety of sales and marketing management positions.
Mr. Zemke holds a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a bachelor's degree from the University of Detroit.

HEADLINE: Consumers Reduce Debt

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Consumers cut their debts in March and avoided taking on new loans that require monthly payments, figures published by the Federal Reserve Board showed today.
Federal policy makers say the steady whittling down of obligations taken on during the free-spending 1980's has been a brake on economic expansion but the trend means that Americans are getting their financial houses in order. 
 During March, total oustanding consumer installment credit dropped by a seasonally adjusted $1.61 billion, or at a 2.7 percent annual rate. That followed a smaller, $465 million decline at an eight-tenths of 1 percent rate in February.
Installment credit is any type of loan from borrowing for a new car to a personal loan that requires a consumer to pay it back in regular installments.
In Chicago today, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, told a banking conference that the drag on the economy from over-indebted consumers was waning.
Consumers fuel about two-thirds of national economic activity by purchasing goods and services, but consumption was restrained last year as a trend toward cutting debt loads became apparent.
The restraint continued in March, with consumers paying off $263 million more in outstanding auto loans than they took out in new ones. That followed a $489 million reduction in auto credit in February.
Similarly, in a category the Fed calls other loans, which includes all sorts of personal bank loans but not home mortgages, a huge $1.45 billion was paid off in March. In February, consumers reduced these loan balances by $721 million.
There was a slight expansion in outstanding credit-card debt, which grew by $55 million in March after a $1.14 billion increase in February, the Fed said.
Outstanding credit for buying mobile homes was up by $53 million in March. That was in sharp contrast to February, when mobile-home credit was reduced by $390 million.
The raw figures for the total of all debts owed by Americans have steadily fallen in each month so far this year.
Before seasonal adjustment, total outstanding consumer installment credit in March was $720.39 billion, down from $725.51 billion in February and from $733.26 billion in January.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Up a Bit

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
The Government said today that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose a moderate 11,000, to 415,000, in late April, signaling persistent weakness in the jobs market.
Massachusetts and New Jersey, long mired in a downturn, bore the brunt of layoffs in the week ended April 25 because of cutbacks in the service sector, the Labor Department said. 
 The rise in initial claims broke a string of declines.
But the four-week average fell to 409,750 from 414,250, its lowest level in 18 months.
"We are moving ahead in fits and starts in the jobs market, just as we are in the rest of the economy," said Jean Sundrla, an analyst at Evans Economics Inc. in Washington.
In another hopeful sign, the latest bimonthly survey of business executives conducted by the United States Chamber of Commerce showed confidence about the economy at its highest level in two years. The chamber's Business Confidence Index rose in April to 63.3 percent from 59.1 percent in February, the last month it was measured.
The overall decline in claims the last four weeks also suggests that the unemployment rate for April, due out Friday, likely remained stable at 7.3 percent with a slight growth in the number of jobs in the economy, analysts said.
"We still have recovery, but one that is a meandering and plodding," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher as Germany Forgoes Interest-Rate Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher on worldwide markets yesterday after Germany's central bank decided against raising interest rates.
Gold prices lost ground here and abroad. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $335.60 an ounce, down $1.60 from late Wednesday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $335.15 an ounce, off $1.45. 
 Currency traders said the dollar received a lift from the Bundesbank's policy makers, who left Germany's key Lombard and discount rates unchanged. Traders had been concerned that interest rates would rise because of the difficult wage negotiations between public-sector employees and the Government.
Higher German rates would have supported the German mark at the dollar's expense. In New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.6375 marks, from 1.6285 on Wednesday.
Traders, meanwhile, showed little reaction to yesterday's unemployment data, in which the Labor Department said that initial jobless claims rose 11,000 in the week that ended on April 25. Instead, attention remains focused on today's release of the April unemployment rate.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed at 132.18 Japanese yen, down from 132.70 yen on Wednesday. It traded higher in London, at 132.70 yen, and at 132.85 yen in New York, up from 132.25 yen on Wednesday.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound compared with Wednesday's levels. Sterling rose to $1.7965 from $1.7940 in London, and fell to $1.7945 from $1.7970 in New York.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Wednesday, included: 1.5135 Swiss francs, up from 1.4980; 5.5165 French francs, up from 5.4860; 1,232 Italian lire, up from 1,224, and 1.19875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19705.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with those of late Wednesday, were: 1.6355 German marks, up from 1.6320; 1.5115 Swiss francs, up from 1.5010; 5.5100 French francs, up from 5.4950; 1.8420 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8365; 1,230.75 Italian lire, up from 1,226.50, and 1.1987 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1965.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Riots Put Focus On Economic Ills

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WHAT effect will the Los Angeles riots have on the nation's economic and social agenda?
It is too early to say whether the outbreak of violence, looting and burning that followed the acquittal of four members of the Los Angeles Police Department in the beating of Rodney King will have any lasting effect. 
 Nevertheless, the crisis in Los Angeles has wrenched the public out of its boredom and cynicism about the political campaign and focused the minds of public and politicians alike on the social and economic ills that have been afflicting the nation -- and particularly on its poorest and most excluded members, the blacks and other minorities.
Coming in the midst of the Presidential campaign, this crisis appeared to deepen the ideological divisions between the Republican and Democratic party leaders.
President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, blamed failed Democratic policies of the 1960's for the riots. And Mr. Bush, flying to Los Angeles, said, "It is far more important to give people a piece of the action than it is to have the Federal Government dump largesse on them."
Gov. Bill Clinton, on the other hand, said the rioting in Los Angeles and other cities was caused by "12 years of denial and neglect" of festering social problems by Republican administrations.
Thus, a political campaign that started as a contest for the votes of the middle class has suddenly been transformed into a fight over the issues of poverty, urban neglect, jobs and race -- and how to deal with them. A solution is critical to the recovery of the United States, which has been long haunted by fears of national decline. There are no simple or single-dimensional answers.
On the economic front, the most important need is for more jobs. As Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, stressed even before the riots, these can be created quickly by expanding the Job Corps, combining employment with training, and by outlays on roads, highways, bridges, conservation and other public projects.
Private enterprise also has an important role to play in rebuilding the central cities. Housing Secretary Jack Kemp's urban enterprise zones deserve support not only from the Bush Administration, whose attention he has at last captured, but from Democrats as well.
For the longer run, solving the jobs problem will require the combined efforts of government, business and community groups, especially to improve the quality and scope of American education at every level, to enable the future work force to produce more effectively, to raise living standards and meet the tests of worldwide competition.
Excellent foreign models exist for reforming United States vocational education. A Federal tax credit for business investment in human resources would help many workers, including the young and unemployed, to improve their skills.
Policies for long-run growth in jobs and living standards will demand a higher rate of national savings and investment. That in turn will require a steady narrowing of the Federal budget deficit, and a restructuring of the budget to meet the nation's most urgent domestic needs.
Support is growing in Congress for a balanced-budget amendment, with alternative plans being offered by Democrats and Republicans. This could prove to be another failure, like the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, but it demonstrates Congress's renewed shame over its past lack of political will and discipline. No budget law can be a Procrustean bed, forcing budget cuts regardless of national needs. There is no substitute for political will, intelligence and guts.
The age of excuses and rationalizations, whether by politicians or their economic advisers, for slipshod budgetary policies may be coming to an end. But the harder job is to trim unneeded programs, whether in the military or civilian areas. And if essential programs are needed to deal with the urgent needs of the the poor, the jobless, the cities, education and infrastructure, and cannot be financed by deep enough cuts in other areas, taxes must be raised to pay for them. Better fiscal policy will clear the way for stronger economic growth.
The Los Angeles riots should serve as a reminder that economic growth is no cure-all. America's problems of race and poverty, crime and family disintegration festered and worsened during the Reagan years of growth. These problems cannot be solved by trickle-down economics but will need to be addressed directly, as through improved local police forces, Job Corps programs for youthful offenders, Head Start programs for young children, prenatal and neonatal care for mothers and children, equitable distribution of resources among school districts and other measures.
Most important of all is a heightened national concern for those left behind by national economic progress, and a recognition that progress will cease and give way to anger, despair and retrogression unless the nation acts to repair the growing split between rich and poor, white and black.

HEADLINE: TV Weekend;
Stephanie Zimbalist as a Victim of Harassment

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
A sure sign that the subject of sexual harassment is not about to disappear soon: It has become the stuff of television movies. This weekend's pat but pointed example is "Sexual Advances," the "ABC Sunday Night Movie" at 9. Stephanie Zimbalist dispenses with much of her normal icy poise to portray a happily married woman who finds herself transformed rather rapidly from rising corporate star to shaken victim.
Paula Pratt (Ms. Zimbalist) works for Hyper Velocity, a Tacoma, Wash., company specializing in athletic shoes. As promotion manager, she focuses on athlete endorsements. When one athlete threatens to break his contract because of patronizing treatment from the company attorney Jack French (William Russ), the account is given exclusively to Paula. Although Jack seems unruffled, he soon starts bombarding Paula with sexual propositions, not in the least put off by her continued insistence that she is not interested. 
 Complicating matters, Paula's unemployed husband, Marshall (Patrick James Clarke), a former football player, is looking for a college coaching job and her company might be able to help. Paula is trapped, and the marriage begins to suffer. She does go to the top boss, Cliff (Terry O'Quinn), and explain what is happening. Cliff is sympathetic, but Jack is a top-notch negotiator and is considered extremely valuable to the company. When Paula finally reaches the breaking point, after a smarmy telephone call to her home, she ponders filing a sexual-harassment suit. A company lawyer soon appears with an offer for a very generous financial settlement, contingent on her leaving quietly.
Being a television movie, "Sexual Advances" is not so much written as nailed together, the carpentry intended to deliver a message but with as much understanding as possible for everyone involved. Jack is a dreadful lout, but there may be mitigating circumstances. He was recently divorced and the loss of that account has left him, literally, sick to his stomach. Some female co-workers sympathize with Paula; some don't. And, just to be on the safe side, Paula herself is no prude. Cliff has a habit of patting her buttocks and grasping her warmly, but she has no objections. It is all a question, evidently, of attitude.
Will Paula settle and walk away, or will she stay and fight? My lips are sealed, but the outcome should strike fear into those politicians who, up until recently, have been grossly underestimating the fallout from an explosive issue.
 
'Abbado in Berlin
The First Year'
PBS
Tonight at 8
The first hour of this "Great Performances" presentation offers an intriguing video-verite portrait of the Italian conductor Claudio Abbado, who succeeded Herbert von Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic. The delicate transition teeters on the demands of the musicians for more democracy, fueled by the still lingering bitterness over Karajan's dictatorial reign. Abbado's diplomacy and sensitivity, especially evident in his nurturing of a teen-age East German pianist named Siiri Schutz, eventually triumph. In the second hour, Abbado conducts the Berlin in a complete performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 1. As one German critic says of the conductor, "One could do things differently, but I doubt if they could be done better."
 
'Dame Edna's Hollywood'
NBC
Tomorrow at 10 P.M.
Festooned in glittering gown, purple-hued bouffant wig and sparkling eyeglasses, the Australian performer Barry Humphries is back for his second American special as eagerly naughty Dame Edna. The character is very popular in England. This time, Dame Edna's guests, who keep showing up despite canceled invitations, include Kim Basinger wearing a tattoo on her right breast and very little else (she left modeling, a giggly Ms. Basinger reveals, because "I wanted my inside to come out"), George Hamilton trapped in a tanning machine ("He'll be beef jerky soon," promises Dame Edna), and Chevy Chase looking increasingly sulky as the host keeps out-quipping him. Best bit: Robin Williams as a pizza deliverer convinced that Dame Edna is Elizabeth Taylor and that her frumpy, dour housekeeper is Nancy Reagan. "Just a picture of you and Nancy," he begs, pulling out his camera. "I can pay for my house." Says Dame Edna: "This is ridiculous, possums." Exactly. But enough of a hoot nonetheless.

HEADLINE: At (or on) a TV Show: Free Fun For a Few

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
THE hottest ticket in New York this weekend is actually free. But there's no point in asking what line you can stand in to try to get one. You had to get in line last August. And you had to have the luck of Sky Masterson.
About 200 people have free tickets to see Bruce Springsteen perform three songs tomorrow night. They'll also see Tom Hanks doing comedy for no extra charge. 
 These people had no idea whom they would be seeing when they learned they were the winners of the lottery that deals out the tickets to NBC's "Saturday Night Live." The tickets were drawn at the end of last August.
The 16-year-old late-night comedy show provides one of the half-dozen or so opportunities to take part in national television as it is being made in New York City. It often isn't easy to get tickets to attend these shows: the sooner you start the process, the better, even for next season's programs. But the rewards are significant for the patient. And the fortunate.
Not only do you get to watch an occasional great performance or see a famous face up close, but you may end up on the small screen yourself, in the company of Dave, Phil, Sally, Joan, Geraldo, or Regis and Kathie Lee on a national talk show.
In fact, all the talk shows that are based in Manhattan need and seek studio audiences. Many of them, including "Sally Jessy Raphael" and "Donahue," actually incorporate questions from the audience into each show. But the wait between the time tickets are requested and when they are received obviously varies widely, and, not surprisingly, it is usually contingent on how well a show is doing in the ratings.
The long-running hit "Donahue," for example, which is broadcast from the NBC studios in Rockefeller Center, has a wait of two to five months for tickets. But representatives of the less popular "Geraldo," which is taped at CBS Broadcast Center on West 57th Street, say fans have to wait only about six weeks to get into their show. The wait for seeing Joan Rivers, whose show is also taped at CBS Studios, is reasonably short, too, usually less than two months.
But "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," taped at WABC's studios in Lincoln Square, is one of the hottest shows right now, which translates into a long wait for tickets: up to 10 months.
One possible strategy for fans is simply to fly standby: show up on the day of the telecast and try for what are known as standby seats. "Late Night With David Letterman," which is so popular it holds a ticket lottery every four months, gives out standby tickets -- one to a customer -- Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8:15 A.M. Fans come and pick them up, show up in the afternoon for the taping at Rockefeller Center, and hope for enough no-shows that day to be able to squeeze into 1 of the 200 or so seats in the Letterman studio.
Because "Saturday Night Live" is performed just once a week and only 20 times a year (the last show of the season is May 16 at 11:30 P.M.), it is unquestionably the toughest television ticket in town. If anything, getting tickets will be harder next season, because the show has enjoyed a significant resurgence this season, with its highest ratings in 11 years.
Things have gone so well that the show's executive producer, Lorne Michaels, who created the series in 1975, is a bit worried. He says he has seen the cycle of dizzying success hit before, and it was always followed by a dispiriting deflation. "My hope is we'll get through this little period of success," he said.
The latest surge of success for the series has extended to Mr. Michaels personally. He was named the broadcaster of the year by the International Radio and Television Society, an honor that probably won't help much when he sets out to renegotiate with his cast of rising stars. At the moment, Mr. Michaels said, he expects every member of this year's regular cast to be back next season.
 
With a Little Help. . . .
 The easiest way to get a ticket to "Saturday Night Live," and the only way to procure one for a specific performance, is to be a client, friend or relative of somebody officially connected to the program. As with most other shows, this category accounts for a significant portion of the "Saturday Night Live" audience: about one-third of the house total of about 300.
But members of the public still have a chance to get a ticket to either the dress rehearsal or live show, as long as they know the rigidly enforced rules for applying. To get tickets for next season, here's the procedure: send a postcard (no letters or you're out), make sure it's postmarked this August, and be willing to drop everything else that's happening in your life to show up at NBC on whatever date comes up if you win. Each fan selected in the "Saturday Night Live" lottery -- held only once a year -- receives two tickets.
The odds on this lottery are certainly better than, say, a $30 million Lotto, but they're still not great. Rosemary Keenan, the spokeswoman for the show, says "Saturday Night Live" receives "many, many thousands" of requests for tickets, even though the series makes little effort to publicize its ticket process.
Clearly, "Saturday Night Live," even after all these years on the air, remains one of the biggest events on television, both for viewers and performers. In the past season, the show has attracted such hosts as Michael Jordan, Roseanne Arnold, Macaulay Culkin and Jason Priestly, and such musical guests as Bonnie Raitt, Nirvana, Hammer, Garth Brooks and Public Enemy. Then there were surprise appearances by stars like Madonna and Barbra Streisand.
 
Help From a Movie
 And when "Wayne's World," the movie made from the "Saturday Night" sketch starring Michael Myers and Dana Carvey, exploded at the box office this spring, the show got some extra sparks.
That was apparent three weeks ago when the host was Jerry Seinfeld, star of the increasingly popular NBC sitcom "Seinfeld." The fans who lined up in the lobby of 30 Rockefeller Center, the NBC headquarters, in their jeans and designer athletic shoes, buzzed with the anticipation of those about to go to a party they know they'll enjoy twice, the second time when they get to rub it in to their friends.
This weekend "Saturday Night" is even more of an event, with a Sunday-night special at 9 o'clock on NBC -- a collection of the best sketches of the season and special Mother's Day material with the real-life mothers of the cast -- complementing the coup of landing Mr. Springsteen for tomorrow night's show. He will be performing live on television for the first time ever. No edition of "Saturday Night" since 1978, when the Rolling Stones appeared, has had so many requests for tickets, Ms. Keenan said.
To be exact, Mr. Springsteen will be doing two shows tomorrow night. But the first one will be seen only in New York. Lottery-winning ticketholders are the only people to see the "Saturday Night Live" dress rehearsal, which, like the live version, is staged in NBC's Studio 8-H.
 
Longer Show at Rehearsal
 Mr. Michaels says he understands that some members of the rehearsal audience are "a little resentful that they're not at the live show." But in truth, getting rehearsal tickets instead of live tickets has certain benefits. Even though they don't get a chance to be seen clapping on camera everywhere from here to Nome, Alaska, the dress-rehearsal audience members do get something special: about 20 minutes more comedy. By design, the dress rehearsal includes three to five sketches too many to fit into the live show.
For example, on the Seinfeld show, the audience for the live version never saw Mr. Seinfeld as James Madison in a sketch about former Presidents coming back to life and facing a hostile press, or as an old high-wire performer reminiscing about the night the act bit the dust. The show's newscast spoof, "Weekend Update," runs almost twice as long at the rehearsal, and many of the sketches that do make it to the broadcast have been cut by a minute or more.
Then there's the material that doesn't get by the NBC censors. The rehearsal is almost always a bit wilder, a bit more over the edge than the live rendition. A recent show starring the actress Sharon Stone of "Basic Instinct" experienced some radical censor surgery between the rehearsal and the live performance.
 
Unused Material Is Saved
 A lot of the material that doesn't make the first cut is rewritten and eventually turns up in later shows. Only the Seinfeld rehearsal audience will know if Mr. Seinfeld was a better James Madison than some other host -- maybe Mr. Hanks this week -- who makes it on the air impersonating the fourth President.
The one real advantage of the live show, Mr. Michaels says, is that the performers clearly save something for the program the whole nation sees. "You don't want to peak too early," he says. "That's a rookie mistake."
Nevertheless, there's a crucial reason why some might prefer "Saturday Night Rehearsed": you get home before dawn. The rehearsal starts about 7:30 or 8 and ends by 10 to 10:30 P.M. Then the house is cleared and the live audience is admitted. They won't get out till 1 A.M. The live audience also can't watch the show as it goes over the air until the tape is rewound. The rehearsal audience is usually home in time to watch "Saturday Night Live" live.
That makes it possible to see how Mr. Michaels puts the show together, what he cuts, what he thinks worked. From the beginning, the idea of doing two shows in one night was to find out which of the sketches, all created in tiny rooms during the week by frenzied writers who sometimes lose touch with reality, really make people laugh.
During Mr. Seinfeld's stint, a sketch about a "Jeopardy"-like game show for stand-up comedians appeared two-thirds of the way through the rehearsal. It was so hilariously successful that for the live show Mr. Michaels made it the first sketch after the introduction, where he usually places what he considers the best bit of the night.
One last piece of advice for enjoying "Saturday Night Live" in person: arrive early. For either show. Studio 8-H is no stadium. Officially, it "holds" about 300; by no accident, the operative verb here is not "seats." The studio has about 200 seats: everybody else is squeezed in wherever possible. The last 50 or so people admitted usually wind up on the steps in the aisles or on the floor of what is known as "the ledge," behind the last row of seats.
No one ever asks for a refund.

Bonilla Hears the 2 Lonely Words: Strike 3!

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, May 7

 BODY:
The game was on the line, the pitch was on the corner, the bat was on Bobby Bonilla's shoulder. The umpire punched the air, and the latest, disquieting deflation for the Mets was complete.
Bonilla's strikeout against Rob Dibble with the bases loaded and two out in the seventh inning rendered almost certain the 4-2 loss the Mets suffered to the Reds, and left Bonilla standing and staring at the plate. Having lacked the resources to do anything with Dibble's 3-2 fastball, Bonilla was without the conviction to argue Mark Hirschbeck's called third strike. 
 "I told him I thought it was in the same spot as the ball-three pitch," said Bonilla. "He said it was nastier. It wasn't an objection."
 
Remains in Empty Dugout
 Bonilla's dejection afterward, though, sent him searching for solitude. The right fielder with the huge contract and the great taste for competitive moments sat in an empty dugout and looked out on an emptying Riverfront Stadium. On and on he stayed. At last, with all the seats in sight vacated, Bonilla got up and left his.
"I was trying to gather my thoughts," said Bonilla.
There was, though, no recovering the misspent last 72 hours for the Mets, no regathering of a road trip that deteriorated from 3-1 to 3-4, no reassembling of a defense that came apart, no repairing the botched mechanics that ended Dwight Gooden's afternoon after five innings.
"I'm not comfortable with the way we've played," said Manager Jeff Torborg.
Indeed, the Mets hadn't experienced the discomfort of losing more than one game in a row since the season's first weekend. But suddenly, the figure of straight losses is at three. There was no alarm in the clubhouse, but there was an absence of what had been a burgeoning bravado.
"Super pitching can allow you to overcome mistakes," said Torborg. "Pitching sets the tone."
 
Three Errors for Mets
 The afternoon's tone was discordant from the moment Gooden took the mound. The Reds got a man on in the first and had a run across instants later after Dave Magadan contributed the first of the club's three errors.
"Doc struggled -- with his mechanics and all game," said Torborg. "He got out of whack."
And then another inning got out of control in the third. The disorder began with Gooden walking pitcher Chris Hammond to start the inning and then yielding a double to Bip Roberts. Eddie Murray's error as he attempted to come up with Dave Martinez's bouncer to first led to one run, Reggie Sanders's single delivered another and then Gooden's pickoff attempt at second base resulted in another error and, one groundout later, another run.
"It was a bluff," Gooden said of shortstop Dick Schofield's terminated break to the bag at second for the pickoff play. "I should have held the baseball."
Gooden never felt right with the baseball in his hands all afternoon. The movement of his hips and the drive of his legs through his delivery had left him twisted in confusion and awkwardness. In what was his shortest outing of the season, Gooden was lifted by Torborg before the sixth inning, his total of walks at four, his pitch count disturbingly high.
"That's the time when someone could hurt themselves," said Torborg.
What bruised Gooden most wasn't his early removal, but his lack of control. His fastball since surgery is not yet where he wants it, and so the requirement that he be sharp is all the more unforgiving.
"I never just reared back and threw it, anyway. I always tried to hit spots. It's just been harder," Gooden explained. "I'm frustrated with the walks. I've walked leadoff guys, pitchers, guys with two outs. It's a lack of concentration."
 
Trouble in the Clutch
 The entire afternoon was concentrated into the squareoff involving Bonilla and Dibble in the seventh. Dibble had been summoned with the bases loaded and two out and Bonilla at the plate. The Mets' right fielderhad a lot to make up for. He has not had a home run since the season opener, he had only four extra-base hits in the last 27 games and he had gone 2 for 16 with men in scoring position over the last several weeks.
"Those are the moments where you get your memories from," said Bonilla. "I was going for it."
And Dibble, who had his best fastball of the season (96 miles per hour), was coming right at him. He threw six straight fastballs -- all away, the last one catching the last fraction of the right side of the plate.
"I said earlier in the season that there is no one in the game I'd want up more than Bobby in that situation," said Magadan.
Bonilla was left looking at the umpire's fist, the ninth time he has taken a called third strike in the last 12 times he has struck out.
"When it rains, it pours," said Bonilla. "But the sun has got to come out soon."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Mets on Thursday claimed Cubs utility man CHICO WALKER on waivers. Walker, 33 years old, was hitting .115 in 19 games with the Cubs this season. Last year, he hit .257 for the Cubs in 374 at-bats. To make room on the roster, the Mets sent CHRIS DONNELS to Tidewater.

GENERAL TIRE TO CUT U.S. WORK FORCE BY 3.3 PERCENT

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
General Tire Inc. said it would cut its United States salaried work force by 100, or about 3.3 percent, and transfer about 60 employees as part of a previously announced restructuring. The layoffs will take place between now and the end of the year, and most will occur at the company's operations in Akron, Ohio. Sixty technical-staff employees will be transferred to manufacturing operations at Charlotte, N.C.; Mayfield, Ky.; Mount Vernon, Ill., and Bryan, Ohio. 
 General Tire, a unit of Continental A.G. of Germany, has 3,000 domestic salaried employees and 5,000 hourly workers. The company said earlier this month that it would reorganize into three major business units: passenger and light-truck tires, commercial tires and corporate support.

HEADLINE: Mr. Rohatyn's Proper Role

 BODY:
Once again, City Hall and Felix Rohatyn disagree over the use of $200 million in surplus money at New York's Municipal Assistance Corporation. Gov. Mario Cuomo and Mr. Rohatyn, chairman of the M.A.C., want the money for public schools. Mayor David Dinkins would use it for productivity agreements with labor -- perhaps to grant raises in exchange for long-term savings.
Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez has put together a very attractive proposal for the money. The Dinkins administration has no specific plan yet, and the idea of using the surplus for wage increases in the 1993 mayoral election year is troubling. 
 Once City Hall does develop a proposal, who should decide where the money goes -- Mr. Rohatyn or Mr. Dinkins? The Mayor, accountable to the people who elected him, has to make the decision. Mr. Rohatyn, who is appointed by the governor, has a more limited role. His primary responsibility is to protect his bondholders. If he found City Hall's proposal financially irresponsible, he'd have every right to keep the surplus and use it to pay off M.A.C. debt. But if his objections are political rather than fiduciary, he should not be in a position to withhold the surplus.
Mr. Rohatyn objects to spending the surplus on labor, arguing that could hurt the city economy and, therefore, bondholders. But he needs to wait for the city's plan to make that judgment.
Mr. Rohatyn has chosen to impose not only his fiduciary values but his social values on the budget. Fortunately his values are sensible and humane. But his abiding concern for the city puts him in danger of overreaching. Indeed, the M.A.C. surplus is, in a sense, city money, because the interest and principal on M.A.C. bonds are paid using part of the city's sales tax revenues.
While Mr. Rohatyn prefers giving the surplus to schools, he will accept any fiscally responsible request the Mayor and Governor agree on. That approach has resolved the use of over $3 billion in past M.A.C. surpluses; it can work again.

HEADLINE: An Environmentalist? Bush? Forget It.

BYLINE: By John B. Oakes; John B. Oakes is former Editor of the Editorial Page of The New York Times.

 BODY:
With the environmental security of America and the world at risk, President Bush is playing a cynical political game. To support his claim that he is an environmentalist, he has apparently decided to attend the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development -- the so-called Earth summit -- in Rio de Janeiro next month. But Mr. Bush is no environmentalist.
If he were, he would long ago have discarded his fears of the right wings of both parties. He would have had the vision to grasp the leadership of this international effort to control forces that present a greater threat to civilization than the cold war ever did. 
 Instead, by longstanding indifference, if not hostility, to the Rio meeting and a negative approach to many of its complex issues, the Administration has nearly sabotaged it.
By holding off on accepting the Rio invitation for months, Mr. Bush discouraged other heads of state from coming, but not some close friends and keen competitors, including Japan, Britain, Germany and Canada. Their leaders understand what is at stake.
The third world's demand for first world economic and technical help to meet the environmental crisis has brought on a super-crisis of its own. This is the quandary the summit faces, and only first world leadership can solve it. Mr. Bush, supported by his party and Congress and untroubled by the flaccid Democrats, is not providing that leadership.
Whether he goes to the Rio meeting is now of less importance than the impact of Administration foot-dragging on the issues to be considered there. They include the advance of global warming and the linkage among poverty, population, destruction of forest resources and loss of species in the developing world. Combating these dangers requires major help from the first world.
No better example of the Government's obtuseness on environmental and economic issues can be found than in its near-sabotaging of the "climate convention" intended for signature at Rio. This treaty would require industrial countries to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
Carbon dioxide is the most profuse of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming: a catastrophe in the making that, unless checked, will raise sea levels, drown coastal areas and change agricultural production before the end of the 21st century.
Every major industrial nation has agreed to stabilize its carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels within eight years. Only the U.S. has refused to make a legally binding commitment to do so. President Bush has said such a treaty would "put a lot of Americans out of work."
This is disinformation. The truth has finally leaked out: The Government has just admitted that measures it has taken and is willing to take to increase energy efficiency would come close to meeting the proposed emission goals. The gas industry points out that cutting emissions even 10 percent below 1990 levels by the turn of the century would create more than 80,000 new jobs.
But without a legally binding commitment to reach these easily attainable levels, promises to try to meet them are evasive at best and deceptive at worst. Politicians' promises are valueless. Commitments in law are something else. Mr. Bush will long since have been out of office by the year 2000, the treaty's deadline. By then, he will (or should) have gone down in history, second only to Ronald Reagan, as America's anti-environmental President.

More Arms, Less Aid

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Poor countries now spend about $175 billion yearly on arms and soldiers. That is more than double the development aid they receive from all sources.
With growth slowing in rich nations and with new demands for aid by states of the ex-Soviet empire, poor countries have only one place to turn for big government bucks -- themselves. To avoid deeper poverty they will have to shift their own funds from military accounts to economic development. 
 International lending institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have recently begun prodding poor states to think about this trade-off. The bankers use common sense and moral suasion -- not exactly heavy artillery.
Germany and Japan have just adopted a tougher and more direct approach. They are now explicitly tying their development aid to cuts in recipient military spending.
The idea is daring and promising, if they stick with it -- and more importantly, if the international banks play an even bolder role. It then could prove to be a major step forward in post-cold-war diplomacy, whose core will be to use economic power for both economic and security ends.
Tokyo and Bonn know that this power must be employed delicately. No nation, no matter how destitute, likes to be told how much military "security" to buy.
So Japan's strategy is mainly to reward, not bully. "If the recipient makes some effort to cut military expenditures and spend more on economic development, we appreciate that effort and give some kind of bonus," explained a Japanese diplomat.
Germany also prefers rewards for cuts, but is prepared to play rougher. One of its criteria for giving aid is that the recipient concentrate resources on health, education and the like. "In many countries," reads the official German policy, "it will not be possible to achieve this without reducing exaggerated defense expenditures." For this and other reasons, Bonn has announced reductions in aid to the likes of India, China and Pakistan.
Tokyo threatens stern measures when weapons of mass destruction are involved. For example, Japan delivered this hard, public message to North Korea: No diplomatic recognition or aid unless you open up all your nuclear facilities to international inspection. But the issue here for Tokyo was the nukes, not Pyongyang's overall military budget.
In any event, Germany and Japan cannot take on the military spending/ development challenge alone. It might help if the Bush Administration lent its weight. But the United States is not the problem here. Contrary to liberal hand-wringing, America has been pretty good over the years in not hawking arms to the poorest countries. Egypt and Pakistan have been the notable exceptions.
The principal arms merchants to the poor have been the old Soviet Union, Britain, France, China, India, Brazil and Czechoslovakia. These countries are not about to forfeit cash and restrain their sales. The Bush Administration is urging limits anyway, though it is not pushing very hard. And it is right not to invest much time or hope in such a complicated enterprise.
The problem is not going to be dented by individual donors and arms suppliers putting on a pretense of restraint -- or with ad hoc restraint by enlightened states like Germany and Japan. Which brings the discussion back to the big international banks.
"These banks have to take more of the lead," argues C. Fred Bergsten, a formidable international economist. "It's easy for Japan or the U.S. to tell others not to sell arms, but they'll sell anyway and poor nations will buy anyway. The banks give everyone an umbrella for agreeing on a consistent and comprehensive policy."
The appeal of this approach is that no one nation has to be out front. The I.M.F. and World Bank provide a cover for individual lenders to collar their own arms salesmen and be tougher on buyers.
Lewis T. Preston, president of the World Bank, and even more so Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, have already gotten their boards to agree on pressing borrowers to curb their defense spending. And bank officials have been rightly attentive to the complexities and sensitivities of the issue. But they owe it to the poor, now sinking further into despair, to press harder still.

HEADLINE: King Case Speaks of Our Grave Condition

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The 20th century should have taught us that to be silent in the face of egregious injustice is to be complicit in it. In the 1980's, in the wake of the bombing of a synagogue in Paris and desecration of a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras, French citizens of all ethnic and racial backgrounds demonstrated under the slogan "We Are All Jews."
In this same spirit, following the verdict in the trial of four Los Angeles police officers for beating Rodney King and the understandable if unjustified avenging riots in several black ghettos, concerned Americans should rally around the battle cry "We Are All African-Americans." 
 This is particularly urgent in an increasingly brutalizing "free"-market and imperial society, in which too many politicians and intellectuals unwittingly contribute to turning African-Americans into helpless lightning rods for the spiraling frustrations and resentments of a vast but powerless lower middle class that spans the full ethnic spectrum.
As Washington preaches and dictates human rights around the globe it needs to be reminded that to fix excessively on the mote in the eyes of others is to risk ignoring or deflecting attention from the beam in our own.
The extravagant overrepresentation of African-Americans among the unemployed, the poor, the sick and prison inmates in this country is not acceptable, even by the minimum standards of the so-called "first" world. There is no way of understanding and changing the dehumanizing conditions in the ghettos of our inner cities without confronting and challenging the racist attitudes and policies that help foster them.
The road to the end of democracy will remain paved with compassion and lamentation unless combined with critical social thought, as well as systematic and massive programs for social and racial justice without exceptions. Ironically, should the verdict be nullified, it is likely to assuage the guilty liberal conscience without which even cosmetic reforms will remain stillborn.
But whatever the reasons for what Gunnar Myrdal even a half-century ago called "the American dilemma," it is nothing short of criminal to blame the victims.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
A Show of Attention Brings A Show of Wearied Shrugs

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 7

 BODY:
To the residents of South-Central Los Angeles, the visit of the President of the United States to their devastated neighborhood was at best welcomed as a needed show of attention, at worst rejected as irrelevant.
Mr. Bush came with the quiet of dawn and left with a whoosh of his motorcade at 9:59 A.M., almost before anybody knew he was in the " 'hood." 
 "Let's go, folks, hustle up -- we're moving out," shouted a Secret Service agent to drivers in the caravan of limousines and vans waiting on East 50th Street outside the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church, where the President met local leaders, among them Roger Cardinal Mahony. With that, the President's tour of South-Central Los Angeles was over, about three hours after it started.
"We appreciate he's here to help," said Coral Turner, an aircraft factory worker who has lived on East 50th Street for 46 years. "But you cannot drive in here in Mercedes-Benzes and feel how we live, how we feel."
Still, to the Rev. Edward V. Hill, the pastor of the church, the event was historic, a good omen. "We've never had a President come to the heart of the ghetto," he said. "The more he is exposed to these kinds of leaders, the Cardinal, ex-gang members, he cannot help but be impressed."
He added that he thought the visit would lead both to Federal indictments of four white police officers, whose acquittal on charges connected to the beating of a black motorist touched off the disorders, and to a cooperative effort to rebuild.
 
No 'Big Deal'
 The residents of the South-Central area, however, were mostly more cynical, more resigned, less hopeful. Edward Criswell, a 40-year-old tow-truck operator, barely took notice of the President's motorcade as it passed him on Crenshaw Boulevard.
"I don't get the feeling like he wanted to see anybody here," said Mr. Criswell, who is black. "He just wanted to see the damage and get out. He's not going to be any big deal in my life."
And James Jones, who is 18 years old and unemployed, stared at the dirt in front of his graffiti-scarred apartment around the corner from the Mount Zion church and said of Mr. Bush: "I've got nothing to say to him. Ain't nothing going to happen. I'm just going to live my little life."
After the first of his two stops -- an inspection of the burned and looted Crenshaw Town Center shopping plaza -- the President's motorcade sped east toward the church on Vernon Avenue. If he could see much at the high speed, the President witnessed terrible destruction: the burned Cashland Check Cashing store, boarded-up gas stations, the burned corner at Vernon and Central Avenue that resembled a scene from Beirut.
The neighborhood around the church is emblematic of the rapidly changing demographics of the South-Central area. Black families live alongside newcomers from Mexico and Latin America in small bungalow-style houses, some of them immaculately kept behind gardens of oleander and hibiscus, others in disrepair. Gang graffiti are everywhere; the alleys are littered with rotted old furniture, tires and trash.
Yolanda Limon, a clothing store clerk born in Mexico, stood before her green stucco house behind a white iron fence on 50th Street and watched the crowd of reporters and organizers at the church. "We think it's good because it makes a difference for him to see this," she said. "We expect something to come of it.
"But while he is in there talking, the drug dealers are out here selling," she said, pointing down the street.
For most of the young black men in the neighborhood, the President's visit elicited not even a glimmer of hope. In interviews, they expressed anger not so much at the poverty in which they lived as at a justice system that they say offers little justice.
"I'm surprised it took this to get him here," said Sammie Rhodes, a 26-year-old newspaper deliveryman. He said he and most other young black men in the neighborhood had been beaten by police officers at one time or another, like the motorist, Rodney G. King.
"The system does not work," he said. "They call it justice, but it's 'just us.' "
At age 37, Foster Mijares, a black truck driver, was not as angry as the younger men, though he was skeptical about the President. "He's sincere, in the sense he is worried about what happened," he said. "It could happen in any other city. It took something like this to bring him out."
 
Where Are 'Regular People'?
 The President, he went on, was seeing the wrong people, meeting mainly with the established black leadership. "He needs to see regular people, not just the representatives of the community who really don't live here. We need some people who'll tell the truth," he said.
His neighbor, Ms. Turner, agreed. She said she was a member of the church but had not been invited to the ecumenical service with the President.
"To me it feels like a political thing," she said. "It was done all wrong. They should take four or five people who could not go to the store, the park, who don't have jobs. If you have a carton of milk and take the cream off the top, you have no idea what the milk tastes like." (In fact, the President did meet at the church after the service with a group of neighborhood residents whose businesses and jobs had been wiped out.)
Asked who they looked to for leadership in the aftermath of the riots, if not President Bush, few could think of anyone else. A couple mentioned the Rev. Jesse Jackson or Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, without great enthusiasm. No one mentioned Tom Bradley, the black man who has been mayor of Los Angeles since 1974, or Gov. Pete Wilson of California.
"Bush doesn't speak to the problems, but I haven't heard anyone who does," said Ed Matthews, an unemployed real estate broker, standing in front of his house just a block from the burned shopping mall Mr. Bush visited.
 
No Different From Washington
 "It's a nice gesture that he came to see the damage but it's just the political maneuver that people in his position need to do," Mr. Matthews said. "I don't think it will make any difference to solving the underlying problems. He's not going to see anything all that different here than he could see in Washington: It's poverty."
Nearby, Jose Leal, the 23-year-old security guard at the shopping mall, was miffed that the Secret Service forced him to leave his post and move across the street, where he could not see the President he voted for. He was worried that the President's mission might fail.
"The word is out in the neighborhood: no justice, no peace," he said. "If Bush is really going to fix it, he's got to start with the Rodney King case. From there, a lot will be cleared from people's minds."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 9, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about residents' reactions to President Bush's visit to areas in South-Central Los Angeles damaged in riots referred incorrectly to Mayor Tom Bradley. He has been Mayor since 1973, not 1974.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
BUSH PLEDGES HELP TO RIOT-TORN AREA

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 8

 BODY:
President Bush concluded his 38-hour inspection tour of Los Angeles today, offering words of compassion for anguished welfare mothers and victims of street violence, and a promise that "government has an absolute responsibility to solve these problems."
He announced a $19 million aid package for Los Angeles that includes more money for Head Start programs, health and drug-treatment clinics, housing for about 175 low-income families, worker retraining and law enforcement to combat drug dealers. 
 As a point of comparison, $80 million alone will be spent on the Head Start programs in Los Angeles County in the year that will end in September, according to the Federal Department of Health and Human Services.
 
No 'Status Quo,' He Says
 As he left Los Angeles this afternoon for Washington, Mr. Bush vowed not to permit a "return to the status quo." Hoping to discourage any renewed violence, the White House went out of its way to let people know that Federal troops, while no longer on the streets, were still close at hand and that the National Guard remained under Federal command.
But Mr. Bush offered few long-term solutions to the problems he acknowledged, apart from announcing that he would ask Congress to reconsider proposals he has been making for more than three years. These include creating incentives for businesses to invest in urban areas, allowing parents to choose which public school their child attends and establishing new rules to cut down on lawsuits.
Aware that he was exposing himself again to criticism that he was repackaging old ideas to meet a new demand for action, Mr. Bush said: "I know some will say, 'Well, you've proposed this before.' And that's true. They're right. And I'm proposing it again. Because really, we must try something new."
 
'Take Time to Put Things Right'
 White House aides had billed today's speech, given to the Challenger Boys' and Girls' Club in the South-Central section, as the capstone of his trip to Los Angeles, a summation of how the nation had come to the nights of violence last week and what the President proposed to do about it.
Indeed, Mr. Bush sought to present a broader look at America's problems than he has previously offered in an Administration that has focused primarily on the problems of business and not the inner cities. "This tragedy seemed to come suddenly, but I think we would all agree it's been many years in the making," Mr. Bush said. "I know it will take time to put things right."
Criticized for years as lacking understanding of the problems of the poor, the homeless, the unemployed and minorities, Mr. Bush admitted that he "can hardly imagine the fear and the anger that people must feel to terrorize one another and burn each other's property."
But the address, which Administration officials were still wrangling over late Thursday night, was essentially a modified version of Mr. Bush's recent campaign speeches. After the sharp emotions and stark images of Mr. Bush's visit on Thursday to areas hit hardest by the riots in Los Angeles, today's schedule seemed to regain the flavor of a campaign swing.
On Thursday Mr. Bush listened to the angry complaints of black, Hispanic and Korean-American residents of Los Angeles. Touring the ruins of businesses and neighborhoods, he carried a stricken expression.
Today he returned to more familiar and comfortable territory. He spoke to firefighters, police officers and soldiers, who gave him a far friendlier reception than he got on Thursday. He tried on hats, including a firefighter's white helmet with the word "President" emblazoned on it, climbed aboard a red fire truck to watch a demonstration of how the hoses and water cannon work, shook hands, ate doughnuts and waved at men and women in uniforms.
Early this morning Mr. Bush went to Cedars-Sinai Hospital to visit Scott Miller, a firefighter who was shot in the neck and critically wounded while driving a hook-and-ladder truck to a blaze in South-Central Los Angeles on April 29, the day riots erupted after four white police officers were acquitted in the beating of a black motorist.
In the hospital room, Mr. Bush seemed uncomfortable and at a loss for words. "This is fantastic," Mr. Bush said at one point. "We're glad to be here. Absolutely." Looking at the young man, who lay in his bed partly paralyzed and unable to speak, Mr. Bush added to no one in particular, "Is this still the eighth?"
While Mr. Miller gazed at his wife, Kathi, Mr. Bush signed autographs and handed out tie pins. It would have been an awkward moment under any conditions, but Mr. Bush's attempt to express sympathy seemed to underscore the trouble he has had in shedding the image of a detached, aloof President.
Mr. Bush reminded the wife of a firefighter who was injured in the riots about the storm damage to his family estate in Kennebunkport, Me. "I'm sorry Barbara's not here," he said. "She's out repairing what's left of our house. Damn storm knocked down four or five walls. She said it's coming along."
In his speech to a chiefly black audience of adults and children at the Challenger club, Mr. Bush said it was important for him to come to Los Angeles. "The community has been the site of a terrible tragedy," he said. "Not just for you who were impacted the most, but for our entire country."
Mr. Bush said the nation had spent as much as $3 trillion over 25 years to stem "the tide of urban violence and drugs and crime and social decay." But he said, "Where this path has taken us I think we would all agree is not really where we wanted to go."
Using language and imagery that were a striking departure from his previous oratory, Mr. Bush said, "It's hard to read about a young black man dying when the odds are one out of two that he was murdered."
Mr. Bush said women benefiting from the Federal welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, should be allowed to earn and save some money without losing their benefits. He did not mention his own increasingly frequent calls for reductions in other welfare benefits.
 
Bush's 'Action Agenda'
 Mr. Bush said the meetings on Thursday in which Los Angeles residents told him that the Federal Government had failed to help them improve their lives or protect them from violence and injustice had "confirmed why I believe the plan that we have proposed for urban America."
In addition to the $19 million in aid to Los Angeles, the President outlined an "action agenda to bring hope and opportunity back to our inner cities." These were its points:
*A renewal of his proposal to create urban "enterprise zones" in which there would be no tax on profits from investments, an idea that Mr. Bush has had on Capitol Hill for years but has not pushed very hard.
*His current education proposals that center on giving parents the option of choosing which public school their child attends.
*An existing Administration proposal, not pressed hard by the White House and largely ignored by Congress, to make it easier for residents of public housing to buy their homes.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Fights Pressure to Spend $200 Million Surplus on Schools

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins insisted yesterday that it would be "a grave error in public policy" to use $200 million in surplus funds exclusively for schools.
In a strongly worded letter, Mr. Dinkins sent a clear message that he should be the arbiter of how the funds are spent rather than the Governor or the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the source of the money. 
 And to bolster that claim, he announced his choices to fill four positions on the nine-member board of the corporation. The move will strengthen his influence with the quasi-public corporation, headed by Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo appoints the five other members.
 
Cuomo Endorsed School Plan
 Last week, Mr. Cuomo endorsed a plan to spend the surplus on programs to lengthen the school day in middle schools, expand a computerized teaching system to all schools and train teachers to help students to avoid falling into special-education classes.
On Tuesday, Mr. Rohatyn stepped up pressure on the Mayor to earmark the money for schools when he warned that unless the money flowed toward education, the city would risk losing it. He later said he would abide by any agreement that the Governor and the Mayor reached, though he favored using the money for education.
Mr. Dinkins's letter to Mr. Rohatyn expressed doubts that the Board of Education's spending plans would achieve significant long-term savings.
The city's Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, has been waging a no-holds-barred lobbying campaign for the money since January, aggressively seeking support from the Governor and Mr. Rohatyn in a series of meetings. The Speaker of the City Council, Peter F. Vallone, has also put out a different proposal that would use the surpluses in the schools.
Yesterday, Mr. Dinkins's aides said, the Mayor sought to slow down the growing rush to commit the money -- which will not be available for at least 14 months -- to education.
"What we're saying is don't slam the door on the possibility that some other agencies may be able to come up with similarly innovative efficiencies," said Leland T. Jones, his spokesman.
In his letter to Mr. Rohatyn, the Mayor questioned the wisdom of using the entire $200 million on one agency and asserted that the Chancellor had not demonstrated the programs that the Governor wanted would save money in the long run.
"Just as it inefficient to put all of one's eggs in one basket, I believe it would be inefficient to use these limited, one-time resources to achieve productivity, streamlining and downsizing in just one agency," the Mayor wrote.
For months, the administration has supported using the money to improve efficiency, from early-retirement programs to buying computers, but it has advanced no specific plan yet.
The Mayor's top aides have made it no secret that they would like to keep the cache as a carrot to entice unions into swapping work-rule changes and other efficiencies for raises or some other incentive.
Mr. Rohatyn, who has dominated the city's fiscal politics for 20 years, has reacted coolly to such proposals, arguing that they could lead to higher labor costs over the long haul.
As pressure from several quarters has built to earmark the money for schools, the administration has found itself struggling this week to keep its options open as long as possible. City officials have worried about tagging the M.A.C. surplus money for schools during the recession, when multimillion-dollar budget shortfalls can open up overnight.
Mr. Rohatyn said yesterday that the Mayor's request to hold off a decision made sense, since the first $100 million of the surplus could not reach the city before July 1993.
 
'We Don't Have to Rush'
 "I think it's certainly reasonable to say we don't have to rush into this thing," he said. "On the other hand I don't think we should let too much time go by before we have a resolution on these issues."
A spokeswoman for the Governor, Anne W. Crowley, said the eventual fate of the funds would have to be agreed on by the Mayor, the Governor and Mr. Rohatyn. She said Mr. Dinkins's letter did not change the Governor's preference that the surplus should go to education.
"Nothing is really different," she said. "The three of them will now work out a solution on how the money should be spent."
Mayoral aides insisted that the letter's coming on the same day as the Mayor's appointments to the board was a coincidence. Mr. Dinkins told Mr. Rohatyn informally of his choices in December, they said.
 
Supporters Are Appointed
 "There should be no message to be read into it," Mr. Jones said.
The Mayor drew from his political supporters for the appointees. The three new members are Donald D. Kummerfeld, a former budget director and deputy mayor who owns an investment banking firm and serves on the Mayor's Management Advisory Task Force; Peggy Tishman, a philanthropist who is the former president of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, and Reginald F. Lewis, the chairman of TLC Beatrice International, a giant food corporation. They are replacing holdovers from the Koch and Beame administrations whose terms expired as long as two years ago.
Mr. Dinkins also requested that George M. Brooker, president of Webb & Brooker Inc., a Harlem real-estate company, be appointed to a second term on the M.A.C. board.

HEADLINE: Payrolls increase and Joibless Rate Retreats to 7.2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
In the first clear sign that economic recovery has spread to the job market, company payrolls grew by 126,000 in April while the unemployment rate edged down to 7.2 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
The latest figures, which represented the first broad assessment of economic conditions for the month, were better than expected and solidified the view that the recovery had finally reached solid ground. 
 "This month we can say for the first time that there is improvement" in employment conditions, Thomas J. Plewes, an Associate Commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said after a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
 
First Drop Since July
 The jobless rate is widely considered the most politically sensitive economic statistic for an incumbent in an election year, and the drop from 7.3 percent was the first decline in the figure since July. The increase in company payrolls was the largest of three straight gains.
But political reaction in general was restrained as the White House continued to focus on the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, and Democrats found less reason in the report to attack the Administration for its handling of the economy.
In addition to the gain in payrolls as evidence of improvement, Mr. Plewes and others cited stepped-up demand for temporary and full-time workers in business services, a six-point jump to 55.2 percent in the proportion of companies adding workers, another dip in the jobless rate for adult men and a rise in the number of people voluntarily leaving jobs, which is taken as a sign of confidence that another job could be readily obtained.
And while the one-tenth of a point decline in the unemployment rate is not viewed by the Labor Department as statistically significant, the fact that the rate declined at all was taken as another favorable sign.
 
Rate Cut Possible
 Yet the dominant view remained that the recovery, though almost certain to be sustained, would be subdued by historical standards and that another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve could not be ruled out. Average hourly earnings, in fact, eased slightly last month and a Federal Reserve report on Thursday showed two of its money supply measures were growing at rates below their target range.
"The figures suggest an economy that's growing -- but at a very sluggish pace," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist for the First Boston Corporation.
Speaking for the Bush Administration, Labor Secretary Lynn Martin termed the report evidence that recovery was "beginning to be reflected" in the hitherto languishing job market. But she said her encouragement was "tempered by the fact that too many people are still unemployed."
The department's survey of households showed that 327,000 people found jobs last month, exceeding the gain of 240,000 in the labor force. This reduced the ranks of the jobless by 87,000, to a total of 9.5 million. That compared with 6.7 million people unemployed when President Bush took office in January 1989 and 6.8 million when the recession began in July 1990.
For the Democrats, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland complained today at the outset of the monthly Joint Economic Committee hearing on the labor market report that while April's job growth "is welcome, it confirms that this recovery is far weaker than any we have experienced" since World War II.
 
Moving With the Economy
 In general, employment is considered a coincident indicator, which means it moves up and down at about the same time as the economy at large. The jobless rate, however, is regarded as a lagging indicator, one that at the end of recessions tends to keep rising for some months as people who had given up looking for a job are encouraged to think they might find one.
In rejoining the ranks of job seekers, these people once again become part of the jobless-rate calculation.
Among the 11 large states whose labor data were reported today, New York registered a four-tenths of a point decline, to 7.6 percent, while the unemployment rates in New Jersey and Pennsylvania both rose seven-tenths of a point, to 7.8 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively.
Because of smaller samples for the state figures, New York's change was not considered significant while the others were marginally so.
Nationally, the rise of 126,000 in payroll jobs caps three straight advances totaling 270,000. March growth was revised upward to show a gain of 39,000 instead of the 19,000 first reported.
All the increase, however, was in service-producing industries. Construction did not add as many jobs as its seasonal adjustment factor -- resulting in an 11,000 loss -- and manufacturing added just 8,000 jobs.
 
 
Where the Gains Were
 The gain in services, the biggest in almost two years, included an additional 30,000 jobs in health, 21,000 in business services, 46,000 in retail trade, 12,000 in local government and 7,000 in finance.
William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, called business services, which has climbed for two straight months, a bellwether of job growth, since employers tend to be reluctant to hire permanent employees until they become confident about the durability of a business rebound.
Instead, they turn initially to expanding the hours of their existing work force, to contracting work out and to temporary help, which has been particularly strong of late.
Factory overtime rose sharply in April as average weekly hours for the whole private sector edged down six minutes, to 34.4 hours.
But Lacy H. Hunt of the Hongkong Bank Group said he was disappointed in a second straight shorter workweek and in a related index of aggregate weekly hours, which fell in April to 121.6, a bit below its first-quarter average.
"I don't like this pattern," said Mr. Hunt, who for some time has been one of the more pessimistic analysts, adding that the gains in retail trade were probably overstated, in part because the April survey week included the days just before Easter.
Elsewhere in today's report, the number of people unemployed for 15 weeks or more fell by 167,000 last month, to three million, but this was still about twice the number of long-term jobless as when the recession began in mid-1990.
The jobless rate for teen-agers eased 1.4 points in April to 19.2 percent, after two months above 20 percent, but the rate for black teen-agers jumped 3.4 points to 39.9 percent. The Hispanic unemployment rate eased 1.3 points, to 10.3 percent.

DINKINS'S IDEAS FOR THE SURPLUS
Mayor Dinkins said yesterday it would be "a grave error in public policy" to use $200 million in surplus funds exclusively for schools. In a strongly worded letter, Mr. Dinkins said that he, not the Governor or the head of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, should decide how the money is spent. 1

Brooks Bros. Strike Averted

 BODY:
The unionized sales staff of four Brooks Brothers stores in the New York area accepted management's latest contract offer last night after five weeks of wrangling, thus averting a threatened strike.
Jo-Ann Mort, a spokeswoman for the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union Local 340, said the union had ratified the contract late last night. The union represents 200 employees at Brooks Brothers stores on Madison Avenue and Liberty Place in Manhattan, as well as in Scarsdale and Manhasset, L.I. 
 She said it was a two-year contract, with a wage guarantee for the first year, but provided no further details.
William V. Roberti, president and chief executive of Brooks Brothers, said: "Our objective during the talks was to reach an agreement that was economically fair to our associates while also providing them with the tools they need to serve customers better. We believe this contract meets those goals."
The union and Brooks Brothers, which is owned by the British retailer Marks & Spencer, have been negotiating since March 31, when the old contract expired. Under that accord, the average annual pay of a sales associate was $47,000. About 40 percent was a guaranteed base salary, with the rest based on sales commissions.
Brooks Brothers has proposed raising the guaranteed portion of the salary in exchange for lowering or eliminating commissions.

HEADLINE: California Refunds By Insurer

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 8

 BODY:
In the first case completed under a voter-initiated rollback of automobile insurance rates, California's Insurance Commissioner today ordered the 20th Century Insurance Company to pay more than $100 million in refunds to 650,000 policyholders.
But company officials, contending that their rates were among the industry's lowest, said they planned to appeal the refund order in California state courts. Insurers had fought the voter initiative, known as Proposition 103, before it was passed in November 1988, and most have continued to oppose its provisions in court. The measure, together with court rulings, requires rate rollbacks based on the profitability of the insurers. 
 The state Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, had adopted rollback regulations implementing the proposition in October 1991. The hearings on 20th Century, before an administrative law judge, Elizabeth Laporte, were the first to be completed under those regulations.
 
 
Sets a Precedent
 As the first rollback case to go through an administrative law hearing, the action on 20th Century sets a precedent for other insurance companies.
In his order today, Mr. Garamendi accepted a proposed decision submitted to him this week by Judge Laporte. She had determined that a 12.2 percent rollback, amounting to a total of $101.8 million, or an average of about $157 each, should be paid to 20th Century policyholders.
"This is a rock-solid legal decision, which finds that 20th Century owes its policyholders over $100 million," Mr. Garamendi said today. "The company's delay tactics have failed -- they should now do the right thing and pay their customers the money they've been owed for three years."
The company has 5.6 percent of the state's automobile insurance market. The majority of its policyholders are in Southern California.
 
 
'Unreasonable and Inconsistent'
 The insurance company's president and chief operating officer, James O. Curley, said in a statement, "A complete judicial review of the rollback provisions of Proposition 103 is necessary."
Mr. Curley added, "The Department of Insurance standards are unfair, unreasonable and inconsistent with Proposition 103 and the California Supreme Court's ruling interpreting Proposition 103."
Mr. Garamendi said he thought the commission would prevail. "The insurance industry has proven, through the expenditure of over $100 million and by its legions of pin-striped lawyers, that it is capable of tying up the will of the people," Mr. Garamendi said. "But it can't go on forever, and eventually they will lose."
 Under Proposition 103, all insurers that offered automobile coverage were required to roll back their premiums by 20 percent. In May 1989, ruling on a suit by insurers challenging the constitutionality of the proposition, the California Supreme Court upheld the rollback provision, provided that companies retained the opportunity to earn a fair rate of return.
The court also upheld provisions that eliminated the industry's exemption from antitrust lawsuits, that allowed banks to sell insurance and that curbed the insurers' ability to charge higher rates in some regions compared with others.
In her decision, Judge Laporte found that 20th Century's "economic evidence suffered from inconsistencies, unsubstantiated and self-serving assumptions which drive the conclusions, and implausible extreme positions, including advocacy of rates of return ranging as high as 33 percent to 99 percent, as constitutionally required."
Mr. Garamendi's rollback regulations specify an industrywide rate of return of 10 percent.
One other California insurer, Mercury Insurance, has completed an administrative law hearing and is in post-trial briefings. Hearings are scheduled for five other companies.
One large automobile insurer, the Automobile Club of Southern California, waived its right to an administrative hearing and paid its policyholders $104 million last year.
 
 
Can Restate Past Results
 Edward Howard, an attorney with Hall & Phillips in Los Angeles who represented Voter Revolt, the consumer advocacy group that sponsored Proposition 103, said, "We're happy that the rebate process is now on track, and we're anxious to see that the rebate checks go out to policyholders."
Mr. Howard was less pleased that Judge Laporte allowed 20th Century to recalculate its past financial results so as to lower its rollback by $5 million, and said he expected other companies to try a similar tactic.
Robert Gore, vice president of the Association of California Insurance Companies, contended that the ruling was contradictory and argued that it proved Proposition 103 was inherently unworkable.
"We think the ruling has a potential to do irreparable harm to motorists who are interested in low-cost auto insurance," he said.
The ruling places 20th Century "in fiscal danger and will certainly impact the rates it offers consumers by forcing it to take a huge financial hit," Mr. Gore said. He said rates could be lowered only by offering no-fault insurance.

REPERCUSSIONS IN DRUG CASE
New York City police officials said the arrests of six officers in a drug-dealing case had guaranteed a re-evaluation of the department's methods for rooting out corruption among its own. Particularly galling, the officials said, was the failure of what has long been a source of pride for the department: an elaborate internal watchdog mechanism. Page 1.

CUOMO PROPOSES AND DINKINS OPPOSES
 In a clear rebuff to the Governor, Mayor Dinkins sent a letter to the chairman of the state Municipal Assistance Corporation rejecting a plan that the Governor supports to spend $200 million in surplus money from the corporation solely on schools. Mr. Dinkins said committing the entire amount to the schools without considering other agencies where the city might reap long-term savings "would be a grave error in public policy." Page 1.
 
A PLEA IN HAPPY LAND FIRE
The owner of the building that housed the Happy Land social club pleaded guilty to not having an adequate sprinkler system in the building where an arson fire two years ago killed 87 people, many of them Honduran immigrants.

HEADLINE: NWA's Loss Is Narrowed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, May 8

 BODY:
NWA Inc., the holding company for Northwest Airlines, reported a first-quarter loss of $103.1 million, down from a $158.1 million loss in the year-earlier quarter. The airline unit reported a 17.1 percent rise in revenue but posted a $44.5 million first-quarter net loss.
Differences between the airline and the parent, which is privately held, reflect lease and interest costs to carry aircraft assets, Northwest said. 
 The deficit for the airline was narrower than the $61.6 million lost during last year's first quarter, when the Persian Gulf war hurt results. Revenue rose to $1.92 billion from $1.64 billion.
"The key factors that limited our rebound were the recent weakness in the Japanese economy as well as continued sluggishness in the U.S.," John Dasburg, president, said.
Northwest reported an 18.7 percent increase in first-quarter traffic, to 12.8 billion revenue passenger-miles from 10.8 billion. Capacity rose 15.1 percent, to 21.2 billion available seat-miles from 18.4 billion, and the load factor increased to 60.6 percent, from 58.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Study Sees Rise in Child Death Rates

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
The rapid spread of AIDS and a resurgence of malaria and cholera threaten to wipe out more than a decade of health gains among the world's poorest children, according to the United States Agency for International Development.
"We are confronting a major problem with AIDS, seeing death rates we have never seen before," Richard E. Bissell, Assistant Administrator for the agency's research and development, said at a news conference today. 
 By the end of the decade, 10 million children will be affected by the human immunodeficiency virus, he said. More immediately, he added, "malaria is rapidly becoming the single largest killer of young children."
Mr. Bissell and other officials, releasing the agency's annual Report on Child Survival, prepared for Congress, said these new challenges were forcing changes in aiding health programs in the developing world. They said children in these countries had just begun to benefit from international campaigns against childhood diseases.
 
Strategy Shift Is Urged
 Ann Van Dusen, the agency's health office director, said that of a million infants who die each year of malaria, half are in their first month of life, when they have no immunities.
"Eradication clearly is not working," she said. Instead of attacking the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, she said, health workers will have to change attitudes, teaching people to sleep under mosquito netting and taking children to clinics, where they exist, for treatment as quickly as possible.
The report, focusing primarily on poor countries receiving American assistance, said that while immunizations prevented as many as 3.2 million deaths in 1990, and oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea saved a million lives, 13 million children worldwide were still dying each year from avoidable diseases.
Despite the efforts of governments, foreign aid agencies and international bodies like the World Health Organization and Unicef, the report said, a third of the 126 million children born each year in the developing world are malnourished at birth and therefore susceptible to childhood illnesses like measles, whooping cough, respiratory infections and diarrheal disorders.
 
AIDS Could Cancel Gains
 In this setting, the appearance of malaria strains resistant to widely used drugs, the comeback of cholera -- first in Africa and now in Latin America -- and most of all the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus and AIDS can create catastrophic problems for poor nations, the report said.
"In some developing countries, H.I.V./AIDS could become the leading killer of children by the year 2000," the report said, adding that in parts of Africa, the spread of AIDS could cancel out "virtually all the reductions in child mortality achieved through immunization and other health measures."
Life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa could drop below already low levels, it said, and "10 million children could be orphaned by the death of one or more parents in the 1990's."
In Asia, where more than 4.3 million children die in infancy each year, many of them in South Asia, the impact of AIDS has yet to be assessed. Nations like Thailand, the Philippines and India have only begun to face up to the prevalence of AIDS among adults.
Urbanization is also creating new problems in child health, according to the Agency for International Development, which has been operating a child survival program since 1985. Urban growth rates in the developing world are about three times those experienced in the past by industrializing societies.
By the end of the decade, 44 percent of the world's poorest people will live in cities, the report said. Contrary to popular belief, it said, "more than 60 percent of the population growth in urban areas is attributable to natural increase; less than 40 percent is due to migration from rural areas."
In cities of the developing world, 50 to 75 percent of people live in extreme poverty, the report found. And health standards fall accordingly. In Kenya, the report said, infant mortality in the slums of Nairobi was 200 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 74 per 1,000 for the country as a whole.
The report suggested that child survival programs in huge third-world cities could learn from pilot projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia and several other countries where urban neighborhood health centers are being established in slums to serve as links to traditional medical services.
Helene Gayle, the agency's coordinator on AIDS, said at the news conference that more emphasis would have to be placed on education and treating women in the battle against pediatric AIDS since the disease is transmitted to children through their mothers.
Dr. Gayle, whose budget for AIDS assistance worldwide is $100 million -- less than half of the $250 million allocated by Congress for the agency's child survival program -- acknowledged that reaching many women will be difficult because of taboos about discussing sexual activity.

HEADLINE: Peenemunde Journal;
At Space Age Cradle: Shades of Nazi Rocketeers

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEENEMUNDE, Germany

 BODY:
The crisp white sign announcing, "Peenemunde, the Cradle of Space Flight," seems a mouthful, since about all that remains are the ruins of brick factories where rocket fuel was once made, and jagged concrete chunks jutting from moonscape-like dunes where prototype moon rockets were tested.
Some planners are working here to create a space park on the site of Nazi Germany's rocket testing grounds, where some 18,000 German technicians and scientists toiled feverishly for more than a decade. 
 Among their products were the V-1 buzzbomb, essentially the cruise missile of Persian Gulf war fame, and the V-2, the forerunner of the rockets that put astronauts on the moon, but also of ballistic weapons like America's Pershing missile and the Russian-designed Scud.
Indeed, the scientists who labored among the now deserted dunes, like Peenemunde's technical director, Wernher von Braun, were taken to the United States after World War II to begin America's missile program -- the defeated surrendering their secrets to the victors.
 
'A Negative Notion'
 There are reasons to build a space park here: to commemorate this spot and, not incidentally, to find employment for eastern Germans seeking to convert an economy long dependent on weapons to more peaceful needs.
But Peter Profe, a former propulsion engineer in Communist East Germany's air force who is now a spokesman for the park project, acknowledges that there is some resistance to the project. As he led a visitor through the center, which opened one year ago in a disused bunker, Mr. Profe said that, for many, "Peenemunde remains a negative notion."
First, there were the local residents who thought tiny Peenemunde, population 400, had seen enough without a space park luring endless carloads of visitors to clog narrow lanes that lead to the remote Baltic Sea promontory.
Others were appalled by the idea of celebrating the place where Hitler developed the weapon that killed thousands, employing tens of thousands of slave laborers from Russia, Poland, France and other conquered countries.
About 4,000 V-2 rockets, bearing 2,000 pounds of high explosive each and steered by pre-set guidance systems, were launched against Britain and the Low Countries in 1944 and 1945, causing thousands of deaths.
Discomfort over former Nazi sites in eastern Germany is not an isolated or dispassionate phenomenon. Berlin is trying to decide what to do with the remains of Hitler's bunker, and in the Harz Mountains near the Thuringian town of Nordhausen, where inmates of the Dora-Nordhausen camp produced the giant V-2 rockets, plans to exploit the huge underground factories as a source of gypsum have encountered bitter opposition from German Jews.
Local leaders have pledged not to develop the site of the camp, where a third to half of the 60,000 inmates died. At the recent unveiling of a memorial, Gottfried Muller, president of Thuringia's parliament, called the place a "thorn in the flesh of the German people that we should not extract."
The problem with Peenemunde is that it is the birthplace of modern space technology, and plans are going ahead for the park as part of a regional master plan to develop the island of Usedom, where Peenemunde lies. A dozen jobs paid for by the federal Government -- -- for model builders, decorators, archivists -- have been approved. But in fact there is not much left to preserve.
 
Group Led NASA Program
 In August 1943, 600 British bombers raked the area under Operation Hydra, so-called because it was planned to lop off the project's scientific heads. But faulty reconnaissance meant that most of the bombs fell on the forced labor camp, so that although 735 died in the raid, some 500 victims were forced laborers.
What the bombs didn't accomplish, the Allies did after the war, following a Potsdam Agreement mandate that the site be demolished as part of Germany's weapons-building capacity. But that was not until most of the technology had been carried off by Red Army units and 120 of the most important people, like Mr. von Braun -- who chose the Peenemunde site in 1935, when he was 23 years old -- had been taken to the United States.
"Basically, the Russians got the technology, but the Americans got the brains," Mr. Profe said.
The group's members later spearheaded the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space flight program, and some ultimately proved an embarrassment. In 1984, Arthur Rudolph, manager of the Saturn-5 rocket program in Huntsville, Ala., left the United States and surrendered his citizenship rather than face Justice Department charges that he had brutalized slave laborers at Peenemunde and Nordhausen.
Mr. von Braun, the program genius, who died in 1977, also came under attack. He defended his work as driven by the dream of space flight.
But critics like the satirist-singer Tom Lehrer, who mocked him in a 1960's travesty, painted him as the paragon of the amoral scientist, dedicated to his craft of sending rockets up, without caring where they came down or who paid him.
"We have frequently been attacked," Mr. Profe said. "But you cannot personify technology. It is man who misuses it. We cannot forget that this place brought much grief. But it was this technology that brought man into space and to the moon."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS: South-Central Journal;
Amid the Ruins, a Frustrating Struggle to Reconstruct Lives

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 8

 BODY:
Arms akimbo, weight on both feet, Juan David Soto stood patiently outside a check-cashing store in South-Central Los Angeles this week while his wife and a friend waited in line inside.
It has been a week to practice patience. People who live among the ruins of riot-devastated South-Central Los Angeles are trying to reconstruct their day-to-day lives. 
 Nine days ago, when the violence flared, Mr. Soto fled his home with his wife and two-month-old baby because a fire broke out next door at the trading center for vendors, known as a swap meet.
The Sotos returned the next day to find their home unscathed, but their electrical power had been knocked out in the rioting. "For us, the adults, it was not so difficult," Mr. Soto said. "But for the baby, who needs her milk, it was not easy. We kept buying ice to put in a cooler, where we kept her milk, and I connected a light bulb to my car battery so that we could have light at night when we had to get up to feed her."
Cashing a check and getting the baby fed were just two of the normal tasks that turned into time-consuming jobs because of the riot. The Sotos have to drive further to reach a super market and wait in longer lines. And for the first few days they had no bus service or mail delivery.
The three had driven around for more than an hour to find a check-cashing place that had not been looted, burned or closed. They arrived at the site on Vermont and Slauson, several miles from their apartment, to find a long line.
"The ABC supermarket near our house normally cashes it for us, but that's all burned down," said Mr. Soto, a construction worker. "We went to three or four other places I knew about, but those were burned down, too."
After days of huddling at home, watching the chaos on television, many people have devoted the last few days to the business of buying groceries, cashing checks and sending off Mother's Day cards.
At Vermont and Slauson, a security guard stood in the street, trying to untangle the traffic jam created by drivers wanting to get into one of the few shopping areas not swallowed up by the fires and the fury. Once inside, the shoppers stood in long lines.
Arson, looting and vandalism had claimed the businesses on the other three corners of the intersection. But somehow, they spared the southeast corner with its Kmart, Sav-On store, The Boys grocery store, McDonald's and other smaller businesses.
"I'm here to buy a birthday card for my son," said one woman rushing across the parking lot on Wednesday. "His birthday was really yesterday, but I wasn't ready to go out yet."
A sense of rebirth and cooperation filled the air. Shoppers greeted each other by name, merchants waved to passers-by. "Everybody's still closing early, but it's getting back to normal now," said Harriett Boyer, who operates a key-copying kiosk in the shopping center.
This center probably managed to avoid being hit by looters and arsonists, said a security guard, Lindberg Bernanrd, because it is ringed by a six-foot-high iron fence. Now it is one of the few places left to shop in a neighborhood that even before the riots had fewer banks, grocery stores and other service stores for each person than other parts of the city.
"It's been pretty rough on people because they have no more places to shop," said Larry Johnson, a cab driver sitting on a bench, waiting for a fare. "A lot of people lost power for four or five days. There were problems with food shortages, and getting to the places that aren't burned down. The buses are running now, but they're so crowded."
Lucill Johnson was just grateful to have a job. A cashier at The Boys for 29 years, she woke up a week ago to find the store where she normally worked had been burned down. Her employers transferred her to the store at Vernon and Slauson, four miles from the burned-out store. Other employees were not so lucky.
"There were eight or nine stores that we lost, and that's a lot of employees," she said. "You have to drive further to work, and you have to take whatever job or whatever hours they give you.
"It's kind of chaotic, but Boys is really, really taking care of its employees. It kept the employees that it could by transferring them to other stores, and it told the others that they should immediately file for unemployment until they can rebuild. So, we're surviving."

HEADLINE: Political Rarity: 2 Lawmakers Bask in Thanks

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., May 8

 BODY:
As Senator Christopher J. Dodd and Representative Sam Gejdenson arrived at the shipyard gate just after dawn today to meet the workers who build Seawolf submarines, an ebullient union leader exclaimed: "Say hello to Chris and Sam. They're the guys keeping us afloat. We would have lost our jobs without them!"
Those were the words that Mr. Dodd and Mr. Gejdenson woke up early to hear. Facing potentially difficult re-election races in November, they shook hands and joked with the workers at the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics, knowing that their jobs, too, may be riding on the Seawolf. 
 The two Democrats have led the fight to save the Seawolf program against the opposition of President Bush, who wants to stop building the submarines because, with the end of the cold war, the boats no longer seem to have a mission. A series of tough votes this week have suggested that the Democrats are quite likely to succeed.
One Seawolf is under construction, and the budget includes money for two more. Hoping to save $2.9 billion, President Bush had wanted to revise the budget to delete those two.
But General Dynamics said that would doom its operation here. This week, the House voted to include money for one more Seawolf. Thanks largely to Mr. Dodd's efforts, the Senate voted to build two more. The conflict is to be resolved in a conference committee next week.
Local needs often drive national politicians. In that sense it is not surprising that two Connecticut politicians would work hard to save a shipyard that employs more than 15,000 of their constituents and that is the cornerstone of the economy of southeastern Connecticut.
 
For a Higher National Cause
 But there is still a paradox. When the cold war was alive, Mr. Dodd and Mr. Gejdenson made careers of fighting the Reagan Administration's military buildup. Now they are warning that the country had better not cut military spending too sharply, even when peace is at hand.
"The Seawolf obviously affects our economy," Mr. Dodd said today at a union hall here. But he assured his audience, from labor and management, that their struggle was for a higher national cause.
"Stealth marine technology is critical to the country," he said.
The Defense Department does not see the Seawolf that way. Facing cutbacks, the department does not see the need to build submarines to track a hostile Soviet submarine fleet that no longer exists.
Mr. Bush went to Capitol Hill this week to lobby Senators to vote against the submarine program. But he failed.
"The problem with the Bush Administration is that they want to take $50 billion in defense spending out of the economy in a recession without replacing it," Mr. Gejdenson said.
He argued that the country had to wean itself gradually from 50 years of favoring military industries as it converts resources to cleaning up the environment, building infrastructure and improving education.
 
Inouye's Support Enlisted
 The restoration of at least one Seawolf was a result of a coordinated effort by almost the entire New England Congressional delegation. But the work of Mr. Dodd and Mr. Gejdenson stood out. The coalitions that they built were based on friendships and on some lawmakers' belief that the Groton shipyard should be preserved in case the international climate suddenly shifted course.
Mr. Dodd first lined up Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii and a powerful member of the Appropriations Committee, behind his efforts. As a conservative who believes that developing weapons systems is an efficient way to develop new technology, Mr. Inouye provided a national security rationale for what might otherwise have appeared as a pork-barrel project.
Then, Mr. Dodd persuaded Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, to pitch the case to liberals most anxious to cut military spending.
 
Murtha Under Pressure
 In the House, Mr. Gejdenson set his lobbying sights on his friend Representative John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvanian who heads the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Mr. Murtha had been reticent about the Seawolf program, in part because he favored building surface vessels that are serviced at the Philadelphia shipyards. Mr. Murtha also did not want to use money originally earmarked for the Strategic Defense Initiative, better known as Star Wars, as the Senate had done.
Mr. Gejdenson persuaded Mr. Murtha to allow the financing of one submarine.
"Would I have taken the lead on Seawolf if I was Senator of Nebraska?" Mr. Dodd said. "No. Would I have voted for Seawolf? I like to think yes."
At the shipyard several workers getting off the overnight shift and others just arriving at work walked right past the politicians, refusing to acknowledge their outstretched hands. One worker caustically asked another how many checks had Mr. Gejdenson "bounced" at the defunct House bank. His 51 overdrafts over the 39 months investigated by the Ethics Committee caused him political embarrassment.
Another worker grunted at the Congressman, "H. Ross Perot in '92."
Mr. Dodd noted that the workers may not yet be convinced that their battle had finally been won. He added that incumbent politicians were not any more popular in Connecticut than elsewhere.
The workers know their shipyard may be doomed, anyway, after one or two more Seawolfs have been built.
But generally, the welcome was warm.
"They've given us a sigh of relief," Sue Mack, 39 years old, a weight estimator, said. "We're going to be loyal to these legislators."
Ed Nevins, 32, an electrical designer, said, "Through the efforts of Gejdenson and Dodd, and the union leadership, we got over the hump."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Third-Party Candidate;
In Petition for Texas Ballot, Perot Has Signers to Spare

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 8

 BODY:
At one o'clock next Monday afternoon, Ross Perot is expected to leap across one of the first big hurdles in his probable race for President with plenty of room to spare.
To get his name on the ballot in Texas, he has to deliver petitions with the signatures of at least 54,275 qualified, registered voters at the capitol in Austin by that day, and Mr. Perot plans to be on hand with thousands of his supporters -- and an overflow of signed petitions. 
 The low primary turnout in the March 10 primary, which drew 28 percent of eight million registered voters in Mr. Perot's home state, provided his supporters with legions of potential recruits. State officials told reporters this week that they are bracing for more than 200,000 Perot campaign signatures. To qualify, signers could not have voted in the primary.
At an old-style political rally on the last Sunday in April, Mr. Perot told 2,000 volunteers and their children that they and other supporters had collected "several times" the required signatures. "All the consultants said it couldn't be done," he said.
For what so far has been his only campaign-style rally, Mr. Perot appeared that day on a stage before an over-sized American flag, with a Dixieland band nearby wearing "Ross for Boss" T-shirts. He spoke for less than 10 minutes to a cheering crowd, but the Texas billionaire signed autographs on dollar bills, "Perot for President" hats, signs and other paraphernalia, for nearly two hours.
The head of the Bush-Quayle campaign in Texas, Jim Oberwetter, said that while a vast number of signatures would demonstrate significant grass-roots support for Mr. Perot, Republicans officials believe that his popularity will wane as his positions on issues become more defined and reporters analyze his record during the years he headed the Electronic Data Systems Corporation and often ventured into political arenas.
Bob Krueger, a former Democratic Congressman who ran Paul E. Tsongas's unsuccessful campaign in Texas this year, said Mr. Perot's appeal straddled a diverse group of Texas voters and that his slight edge over George Bush in a recent Texas poll reflected a disenchantment with the President and traditional politics.
"That clearly works to Perot's benefit," Mr. Krueger said. "When people are in desperate circumstances, they will turn to strong-minded individuals with simple solutions. Perot fits that. But he is still in the courtship phase. The time will come when both the courtship and the honeymoon will be over and that is when his testing time will be there. "
 
Standing the Test
 For now, Mr. Perot's supporters insist that his reputation as a man who keeps his word, knows how to make money in business and can solve complex government problems will stand those tests.
Ray Burgin, a retired factory worker, said he voted for Gov. Bill Clinton in the primary, but joined the Perot camp mainly because of Mr. Perot's sharp criticism of the growing national debt.
"I see hard times coming," said Mr. Burgin, 77 years old, who has been a volunteer answering telephones at the Perot Petition Campaign offices here for nearly two months. "Ross Perot is not a politician. He's the best possibility for the next four years,"
Another volunteer, Roy Vokey, a semi-retired salesman who was trained as an aerial gunnery specialist in the Air Force during the Korean War, said he has organized military veterans for Mr. Perot in dozens of states, including Texas.
"There are 27 million military veterans out there, plus their families," said Mr. Vokey, 62 years old. "These guys are workers, they vote and they don't mind participating in campaigns, for the most part." In Denison, Tex., a town near the Oklahoma border best known as a haven for the boaters and fishermen who flock to nearby Lake Texoma, Perot supporters collected more than 4,000 signatures.
Unemployment in the area, a traditionally Democratic enclave that includes Sherman, Tex., is on the rise. It was 7.7 percent in February, the most recent figure available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as against 6.1 percent in the same month a year ago.
Many small factories in the area have trimmed their work force and overtime hours, shops that cater to Lake Texoma crowds also have suffered, and some residents think Mr. Perot, who keeps several speed boats moored at the lake, can improve things.
"He's so successful in his business, and we know that Mr. Perot can find the answers we need," said Linda Wilson, a housewife who organized a Perot petition-signing rally a few weeks ago.
Later that afternoon, in a park in Dallas known as Flagpole Hill where Perot supporters gathered to hand in petitions, an insurance agent from Arlington, Tex., Edmund Koch, said that Mr. Perot's views on issues like abortion and gun control should be secondary to the likely candidate's goal of erasing Federal budget deficits.
"Look, I'm a Catholic and I'm against abortion, but I'm willing to let that and other issues get sorted out later," said Mr. Koch, who said he and other Perot volunteers collected more than 3,000 signatures.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lobbies Business on Free Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., May 8

 BODY:
Taking their trade lobbying from the marble corridors of Congress to the foggy hills of southwestern Virginia today, senior Government officials urged top corporate leaders here to support global free-trade talks and to invest in the former Soviet republics.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, asked executives gathered here for the semiannual meeting of the Business Council to obtain stronger backing from European companies for global trade talks in Geneva. The talks are aimed at lowering tariffs, limiting subsidies and eliminating obstacles to the international operation of service industries, like banking and insurance. 
 Mrs. Hills told them she would also need their political influence if an agreement is completed and submitted to Congress for approval.
 Mrs. Hills later told reporters that an agreement was still possible before the end of the year, but only if European Community nations mended their differences and developed a coherent negotiating position on agriculture. Disputes between the United States and the 12-nation community over farm subsidies have halted progress in the talks for 17 months.
 
Ambassador Urges Aid
 European leaders have consistently denied that their internal differences are the source of the continued stalemate.
Robert Strauss, the United States Ambassador to Russia, exhorted the assembled executives today to trade and invest more in the former Soviet republics as a way to strengthen newly emerging democracies there. "Governments can do a great deal, but governments can't do it all," he said.
Mr. Strauss said he was more optimistic about the republics' future than he was in January and February. The relaxation of food price controls has averted local shortages and possible civil unrest by encouraging people with food to sell it instead of hoarding, he said.
Corporate executives here responded cautiously to the two Administration officials' comments. James R. Houghton, chairman and chief executive of Corning Inc., said a couple of speeches were unlikely to change the views of corporate executives who have thought about these issues for a long time.
But he added that "most people in that room are probably in favor of a good" global trade agreement and a free-trade deal with Mexico, which Mrs. Hills said she hoped could be worked out this summer.
Founded in 1933, the Business Council comprises 100 chief executives of large American corporations. Many former chief executives are also affiliated with the council and also attended today's meetings.
Echoing the views of senior Treasury Department officials, Mr. Strauss also said the value of the ruble should not be supported with Western currency until basic legal and economic policy changes are made that would open up the Russian market. While Russian officials have spoken of giving the ruble a fixed value in terms of foreign currencies on July 1 and then using a $6 billion international fund to support that value by buying and selling rubles, Mr. Strauss said a date of Sept. 1 might be more reasonable.

Details Emerge on Proposed Trade Compromise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., May 8

 BODY:
New details emerged today about a tentative agreement between the United States and the European Community to limit government subsidies to commercial aircraft companies.
The compromise calls for government contracts to be limited to 4 percent of any single company's revenue and to 3 percent of each national industry's revenue, said a Bush Administration official today who insisted on anonymity. The original deal called for a 5 percent restriction on each company and a 4 percent industry limit. 
 The United States, with its heavy military spending, had sought higher limits. But American negotiators agreed to the lower limits this week in exchange for a slight narrowing of which government contracts are included in the definition, a clear statement that only existing companies are covered and not any possible future entrants into the market, and an exemption from the percentages when necessary for national security.
 
Fine-Tuning the Document
 The compromise document is being shown to various Federal agencies and Governments of the 12-nation European Community, while minor issues of wording are being worked out, the Administration official said. The final agreement could be announced as early as next week.
The sides had announced a draft agreement on April 1, but that quickly began to unravel as American and European officials quarreled over what they had been approved and accused each other of backtracking.
This week, the sides mended their differences, which concerned indirect government subsidies through military contracts and other government spending at companies that also produce large civilian aircraft.
The new compromise is important because it comes during broad deterioration in trade relations between the United States and the European Community. A meeting between President Bush and European leaders on April 22 failed to produce a breakthrough in global free-trade talks, and the United States said last week that it was drafting a list of European imports that it might restrict in retaliation for the community's continuing subsidies to soybean farmers.
 
A Closer Look
 The changes are being made to an agreement that already appears better for American companies than was initially apparent.
For example, direct subsidies to aircraft makers will now not only be capped at about a third of development costs, but they will even have to be repaid by aircraft companies out of their sales at fairly steep interest rates. If enough planes are sold, then the subsidies for all but 1 percent of the development costs would have to be repaid, a senior American official said recently.
European governments have been paying up to three-quarters of the development costs for Airbus Industrie, the four-nation constortium, without demanding repayment, according to American estimates.
The European Community had no immediate comment today on the breakthrough. "We certainly want to get this resolved," one European official said.
 
'Very, Very, Very Close'
 In an interview here today, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said that the sides were "very, very, very, close" to a final deal, but she refused to elaborate.
Raymond J. Waldmann, the director of governmental affairs at the Boeing Company in Seattle, said the nation's largest commercial aircraft maker was still studying the tentative deal.
"We're generally satisfied; we're still reviewing some of the fine print," he said.

HEADLINE: Sloan-Kettering Drops Plans for Danbury Satellite Clinic

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn., May 8

 BODY:
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has abruptly scrapped plans to open its first satellite treatment center -- a $2.4 million clinic here -- after encountering strong opposition from Danbury Hospital.
"Our philosophy has been to develop a cooperative relationship with the local medical community," said Mary Joy Jameson, Sloan-Kettering's vice president for public affairs. "It became clear through our discussions with Danbury Hospital that such a relationship was not possible at this point." 
 Dr. David Berger, the chief of radiation oncology at Danbury Hospital, said he was delighted by Sloan-Kettering's decision. "It's been our position all along," he said, "that there was no need for any services that duplicate and drive up the cost of health care."
Doctors here had charged that Sloan-Kettering, like an increasing number of prominent hospitals throughout the country, was trying to establish a beachhead in a well-to-do area for economic reasons, both for the income from treatments at the satellite clinic and to direct more patients to its main hospital in Manhattan.
 
Strengthening a Program
 Sloan-Kettering officials, who had earlier proposed and then scrapped plans for a treatment center in Stamford, insisted that doctors in the Danbury area had approached them about developing an outpatient clinic. They said such a center would make it easier for their patients from southern New England to receive treatment closer to their homes.
Danbury Hospital opposed the plan by Sloan-Kettering, the nation's largest oncology hospital, in part because Danbury has been trying to strengthen its own oncology department.
It already has a radiation-therapy program with one linear accelerator, and in February it requested state approval to install a second.
 
Trying to Agree
 But any hopes that Sloan-Kettering's withdrawal would clear the way for Danbury Hospital were dashed today when the State Commission on Hospitals and Health Care rejected a Danbury proposal to perform bone-marrow transplants. The commission concluded that existing programs at Yale-New Haven Hospital and the John Dempsey Medical Center in Farmington were adequate to meet the state's needs.
Since January, when the Sloan-Kettering proposal was unveiled, doctors and administrators from the two hospitals have met several times to hammer out an agreement.
But Danbury Hospital officials fought the incursion into Fairfield County, and local doctors stubbornly clung to their belief that cancer patients are better served by a hospital than a free-standing clinic.
In the end, Sloan-Kettering decided it would rather quit than fight. In an April 30 letter to the Commission on Hospitals and Health Care, it formally withdrew the plan.
The letter said that Sloan-Kettering understood that its proposal for a free-standing radiation center "was not acceptable to Danbury Hospital and the surrounding community" and that its efforts to reach an accommodation had failed. Thus, the letter said, it was withdrawing the proposal "in order to avoid conflict."

HEADLINE: Stocks Inch Up, With Dow Gaining 6.04

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market inched up yesterday in tandem with Treasury bond prices, which rallied despite a strong report on April employment.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 3,369.41, up 6.04 points for the day and 33.32 for the week. 
 Advancing issues edged out declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange, 853 to 819. Big Board volume came to 168.7 million shares, another light day after 169 million were traded on Thursday.
Uncertainty about the state of the recovery and already-lofty stock prices --the Dow average remained near its all-time high -- appeared to dampen market enthusiasm.
"I don't think anything is clear yet," said Jeffrey Tabak, a principal in the investment firm of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company. "I don't think anyone wants to make any commitments here."
Broader market indexes were mixed. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.12, to 229.20, the American Stock Exchange market value index was unchanged at 394.12 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.40, to 585.76.
 
Labor Department Report
 Stocks were led by the bond market, which shot higher despite a Labor Department report that unemployment fell to 7.2 percent in April from 7.3 percent in March.
The report showed the number of nonfarm jobs up sharply last month, as companies added 126,000 jobs to their payrolls, more than economists expected.
That initially pushed bond prices lower, and stocks also fell in the morning. But economists said the report indicated that inflation was in check and that the employment gains did not preclude an interest rate reduction in the future.
The stock market did not react enthusiastically to the favorable employment report because prices already are high, traders said. Also, with a healthy earnings season ending, there is little news expected that would carry prices higher.
Global Marine the most heavily traded Big Board issue, closed up 1/8, at 1 7/8. The natural gas pipeline company said it received $55 million in a litigation settlement with Transco Energy.
Liz Claiborne rose 2 1/8, to 37 7/8, after offering to buy some operating assets of the Russ Togs retailing operation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Large Advance After a Healthy Jobs Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar staged a healthy advance in active trading on world currency markets yesterday after the release of better-than-expected unemployment data for April.
Gold prices also gained ground worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $336 an ounce, up 40 cents from Thursday. Republic National Bank said gold gained 25 cents an ounce, to a late bid of $335.40. 
 Currency trading hinged on a Labor Department report that showed the nation's unemployment rate fell in April for the first time in nine months, dipping to 7.2 percent as companies added 126,000 jobs.
The report was far better than expected. Most economists had predicted growth would total 60,000 to 70,000 new jobs. But when it became apparent that the economy was more robust that many had believed, the dollar rose on the notion that the Federal Reserve would not have to lower interest rates any time soon to keep the recovery humming.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable for investors, thereby decreasing their need for the currency.
"With the improved prospects for the economy, the dollar has found a temporary base," said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. He noted that trading was particularly active.
Over all, however, interest rate differentials remain negative for the dollar, with German rates at historically high levels.
Still, "the growing confidence in the economic recovery has strengthened sentiment toward the dollar," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
As the American economy picks up steam and interest rates inch higher, the dollar will be expected to rise further, analysts said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 132.55 Japanese yen, up from 132.18 yen. Later in London, it rose to 133.30 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 133.45 yen, up from 132.85 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7885 from $1.7965 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.7910 to buy one pound, down from Thursday's $1.7945.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates included: 1.6445 German marks, up from 1.6375; 1.5255 Swiss francs, up from 1.5135; 5.5335 French francs, up from 5.5165; 1,238.00 Italian lire, up from 1,232.00, and 1.2028 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1988.
Silver prices also advanced. On the Comex, silver bullion settled at $4.077 an ounce, up from $4.034 on Thursday. In London the metal rose to a late bid price of $4.10, up from $4.04.

HEADLINE: After Air-Fare Restructuring, Some Bargains Still Remain

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
When several major airlines eliminated a number of fares last month as part of a simplification process, they cut out not only some of the highest fares, but also some of the lowest ones.
But as the summer travel season approaches, there are still some good deals available to the traveler with the time and patience to look for them, said several travel experts. 
 "What started out to be a simplification of the fare system has started to be a major fare war," said Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares, a monthly travel magazine in Arlington, Tex.
Soon after they announced the new fare schedules, many of the airlines were forced to lower some prices because of competition from carriers that did not participate in the restructuring, among them America West Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Continental Airlines.
 
Fewer Restrictions
 Some consumer advocates said they thought the new simpler fares, which are free of many of the traditional bargain restrictions, were intended to damage financially weak airlines like T.W.A. "The purpose of these fares is to put America West, T.W.A., and possibly Continental, out of business," said Chris Witkowski, the director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, an advocacy group in Washington. Airline officials have denied any predatory intent.
Several travel experts said vacationers will have to look harder for bargains this spring. But Mr. Parsons of Best Fares sees a number of attractive offers. Southwest Airlines, which also flies to the Middle West and Southeast, has free-ticket offers for travelers flying with children or even with another adult, he said.
America West also has a special offer on its transcontinental flights, he said. For example, those traveling between Washington or Boston and San Francisco can make a stopover in any one of the airline's three hub cities -- Columbus, Ohio; Phoenix or Las Vegas, Nev. The stopovers are either free or cost $30.
Ed Perkins, the editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, a monthly publication of Consumers Union, thinks the new fares will generally benefit the public. "I think the domestic fares they are advertising now are pretty good deals, if you can get a seat," Mr. Perkins said.
Europe is a popular destination for summer travelers, and there, also, the news is mixed. Air fares from New York to some European cities, like Paris and Frankfurt, are expected to jump sharply, with even larger rises for Europe-bound travelers from the Middle West and West Coast, Mr. Parsons said.
 
Frequent-Flier Miles
 Randy Petersen, the editor of Inside Flyer, a monthly magazine in Colorado Springs, Colo., advises those traveling from Western cities to Europe who have enough frequent-flier miles for a free domestic ticket to consider breaking their journey in New York or another East Coast city.
"There is about a $400 difference in flying from Denver to London than from New York to London," Mr. Petersen said. "So if you have the mileage available for an award, you might want to use it on a flight to the East Coast."
Mr. Perkins also said that travelers to Europe who want a little more comfort than is offered in economy class should consider the deluxe flights offered by several charter carriers. The flights are about 50 percent more expensive than regular economy fares, but still significantly cheaper than business class.
"It is the only way you can get a comfortable seat at a discount price," said Mr. Perkins of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
Mr. Parsons of Best Fares said that if he were traveling with family members he would fly British Airways, because it is the only carrier that allows the frequent-flier miles earned by all family members to be combined into one account.
 
Attractive Fares From Kennedy
 Joseph Brancatelli, the executive editor of Frequent Flyer, a monthly magazine published by the Official Airline Guide, said T.W.A. had a number of attractive fares on domestic flights from Kennedy International Airport in New York to cities like Boston and Washington.
A major question is how the fare restructuring will affect the number of discount seats available on any flight. Airlines constantly adjust the number of those seats in the weeks and days before the flight in order to sell as many tickets as possible at the most profitable fares.
Most of the major savings in the fare restructuring were on last-minute purchases of high-priced tickets usually bought by business travelers. But several travel experts pointed out that the new schedule also eliminated some corporate travel discounts, which could cause businesses to reduce travel. And should that happen the ultimate loser may be the casual traveler, who will eventually be asked to pick up the tab.
"Sooner or later, in order to afford losing money, the airlines will have to raise the lowest fares or cut the number of seats they sell at low fares," Mr. Perkins said.

Staying Put, Fixing Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
In an uncertain real-estate market, many homeowners decide to expand and improve the house they own instead of buying a new one. There are several ways to pay for improvements. The two most popular are home equity lines of credit, usually tax exempt, and home improvement loans. The typical home equity line of credit has a floating rate tied to the prime lending rate, and is usually over the prime by 1.75 percentage points. Home improvement loans can also have a variable rate, but if there is no collateral, like a house, it is likely to be higher. The rate on a home improvement loan with collateral is about 2 percentage points over the prime rate; the unsecured rate, without collateral, is about 13 percentage points over the prime rate. Qualifications and repayment rules vary by lender. Here are some typical rates and terms based on a $10,000 loan.

HEADLINE: How America Can Help Hong Kong

 BODY:
Congress and the Bush Administration can reintroduce a measure of principle into America's relations with Beijing. The vehicle at hand is the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act, approved on Thursday by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and soon to be considered in the House. The act would allow America to reinforce Hong Kong's freedom by treating it as a legally distinct entity after its return to Chinese rule.
That final gasp of Communist expansionism, set for five years from this July, is a sad fate for a people who have long known freedom. But Americans are obliged to honor the good faith agreement Margaret Thatcher reached with Beijing's leaders eight years ago. Washington can at least insist that the Sino-British Declaration of 1984 be faithfully carried out. 
 In that declaration China agreed to grant Hong Kong a "high degree of autonomy" in all matters except foreign policy and defense for 50 years after the transfer date of July 1, 1997. And it agreed to respect the political and economic freedoms that define the territory's distinctive way of life. Hong Kong residents are thus guaranteed fundamental rights denied to other Chinese.
Beijing has good reasons to honor its word. Heavy-handed meddling risks undermining the confidence on which the territory's prosperity has traditionally depended. But Chinese leaders have shown they will go to extreme lengths to suppress even imaginary political challenges. And Beijing knows that many investors and traders were not chased off by its violent repression after Tiananmen Square. Already Beijing has begun pressuring Hong Kong institutions.
Britain favors a smooth transition. In practice, that has meant bowing to Chinese demands. London lacks the interest and power to defend Hong Kong's liberties. The U.S. lacks neither. America's economic presence is formidable, with more than 900 companies. The Administration regularly cites this Hong Kong connection as a good reason to maintain Beijing's U.S. trade privileges.
The U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act, introduced by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and supported in principle by the Administration, permits separate treatment for Hong Kong on trade agreements, aviation treaties and other matters.
Congress now has an unusual chance to strengthen freedom in China. And the Administration has an opportunity to stand by those capitalist and democratic Chinese it claims to support.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev on Tour: The Artful Supplicant

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 8

 BODY:
The poignancy of Mikhail S. Gorbachev as Bolshevik turned mendicant is undeniable these days as he makes a grand tour of America intended to capitalize a new life for himself.
He is darting about as a kind of foundation Firebird rising from the ashes of Communism to flap on westward toward the future, a hard-currency glint in his eye to finance the endless vents of talk and ideas that keep him aloft. 
 The poignancy was evident last night when a down-and-out Californian, denouncing the "catastrophic" chasm between rich and poor in America, demanded to know how the former Soviet leader -- a man still steeped in textbook fondness for Lenin -- could find himself beseeching alms from an audience of more than 4,000 who paid $40 each just for the privilege of applauding him long and hard.
"I want to fight for the international revolution that Trotsky and Lenin first talked of," said the questioner, boggled by the specter of Mr. Gorbachev being a guest at the estates of oil company executives and California Republicans as he seeks an initial $3 million for his new Gorbachev Foundation.
In a typically wordy response, Mr. Gorbachev gravely counseled that Red was dead.
"Totalitarian regimes are leaving the scene of history," he said, still holding out hope for the socialist idea but conceding that the world was evolving beyond the choice between Communism and capitalism.
The answer left the questioner despairing, but a majority of the audience applauded heartily. Less clear was the response to the foundation pledge card placed at every seat, part of a 10-city, two-week campaign well orchestrated by American fund-raisers who are opening a branch office of the Moscow foundation here.
"If only Gorbachev had a sense of parody about it all, that would help," said a Russian journalist who has watched Mr. Gorbachev flying about with members of his old Kremlin patronage entourage and stepping forward at each fund-raising stop from a corporate jet emblazoned "Capitalist Tool" -- the Forbes magazine plane.
 
Paleo-Capitalist Event
 Parody, irony, self-amusement -- none of those have been hallmarks of the Gorbachev approach to public life. Rather, a sense of decency, stolidness and still remarkable achievement are what is clearly more prized by his American audiences, who rise to cheer him warmly at each stop.
"He gets no such reaction back home," Ellina Yurovskaya, a Russian emigre, said at one of the stops.
A fringe of John Birch Society pickets and traditional American anti-Communists worry that the donations will be earmarked for some neo-Communist plot. But the evidence thus far is decidedly paleo-capitalist, with former President Ronald Reagan waiting at one stop and Henry A. Kissinger the next, ready to boost the tour's goal of producing a "world class" foundation replete with dedicated phone lines, lawyers and accountants.
"I hope you understand you have before you someone who has gone through a great deal," Mr. Gorbachev said last night, as if explaining how his brave new world of fund-raising seems a lark compared to being held hostage in the failed Kremlin coup in August.
 
Lawyerly Cleverness
 "I am not a naive individual," he continued, his small self-effacing smile broadcast across four huge TV screens at the rally as the American public offered laughter and applause in support.
He was far from naive in fielding a question that left some in the beaming audience suddenly anxious: After having spoken up so much about human rights, what did Mr. Gorbachev have to say about the "thousands" of gay people still in jail back home in Russia?
Mr. Gorbachev juggled his answer for some time. But he finally again drew the majority's approval in shifting the issue from Russian justice to the sexual revolution with lawyerly cleverness.
"You are asking a very difficult question," he said. "I can only tell you my ethical attitude. I am in favor of a healthy way of life in a healthy society."
He was no less deft in touching on the unrest in Los Angeles, saying that he had to be on the side of anyone "whose rights are trampled," but that he expected the strength of America to eventually rectify injustice.
 
Talent for Adapting
 Mr. Gorbachev said he had hundreds of speaking invitations to choose among, and guests at Thursday night's forum said the initial $3 million goal seemed easily attainable in a nation where Gorbomania is hardly on the wane.
One of the most remarkable impressions of the tour is that many Americans along the way seem to look upon Mr. Gorbachev as if he were still the head of the Soviet Union, a notion he does not discourage as he makes long pronouncements on world affairs.
Back in Russia he is not box office. He is widely accused of having compromised once too often with Communist hard-liners who tried to restore the police state, and of having focused too little on the economy and other disastrous domestic issues while charming the world beyond with his disarmament achievements. But Mr. Gorbachev retains a talent for adapting, even if somewhat late, as with his new foundation's dedication to studying and encouraging the new Commonwealth of Independent States that he had fought as Soviet President.
 
Authoritative as Ever
 On the tour, the American enthusiasm for Gorbachev the world visionary diminishes not at all when the visitor, caught up in his own self-certainty, accuses the United States of initiating the nuclear-arms race or to defend the Bolshevik Revolution as justly based. His tour demeanor seems as authoritative and outspoken as ever, as if capitalist crowds were a mere variation on the receptive Politburos of yore.
For Mr. Gorbachev, the poignancy of the long-distance fund-raiser seems most evident in the simple moment at events when the American national anthem is played but no music is offered for Mr. Gorbachev, since the Soviet anthem has faded with the empire.
With a week to go in the tour, officials are not saying how much money they have in the kitty. But Mr. Gorbachev seems encouraged, even after taking a sudden tumble in his chair Thursday night from the narrow dais. He quickly bobbed back into sight, smiling and ready for more, before Americans charitable with their applause.

HEADLINE: N.J. Transit Boss Learns to Joust With Legislative Critics

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 8

 BODY:
As head of N.J. Transit, Shirley A. DeLibero holds top-level staff meetings in gritty rail yards. She crawls under buses and peers into locomotives to see what ails them. She responds to customers' complaints by calling them herself.
"How else can I manage," she asked, sitting in the agency's 12-story glass tower overlooking Penn Station here, "if I don't know what's going on out there?" 
 The hands-on approach seems to work. In the 20 months since Ms. DeLibero took charge of N.J. Transit after serving as the deputy director of the Dallas public transit system, she has been praised for bold changes -- from streamlining bus and train service to eliminating hundreds of jobs to improving on-time performance. In the process, she has also won over some of N.J. Transit's harshest critics.
At least until now.
Over the last week, the 54-year-old executive director of the nation's fourth-largest public transit system has made the rounds of legislative committees in Trenton to press for a proposed $790 million budget, a 17 percent increase over the fiscal year 1991-92. And the critics have come out swinging.
 
Fight Over Salary
 Ms. DeLibero has been asked to take a pay cut -- her salary, after a recent $10,000 raise, is $150,000 -- accused of having too many managers and scolded for not doing enough to trim the agency bureaucracy.
On Wednesday morning, when she appeared before the Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee, the chairman, Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a Morris County Republican, angrily accused her of trying to blackmail the Legislature by releasing a list of service cuts that might be necessary if the agency does not receive the aid it requested.
In the afternoon, Senator Robert Littell, a Sussex County Republican and chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, threatened to withhold Ms. DeLibero's salary unless she withdraws plans to build a rail storage yard in Pennsylvania rather than in Trenton.
To her supporters, these jabs are nothing more than a long-overdue initiation into local partisan politics. They say the unpopular agency is a convenient target as the new Republican legislative majority tries to cut Gov. Jim Florio's proposed budget by $1 billion.
Senator Walter Rand, a Camden Democrat and longtime chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, said Ms. DeLibero deserved high marks for turning the agency around.
"She came in when we needed a redefining of the agency," he said. "Before, we had a rail system and a bus system, two separate systems in essence competing with each other. She brought them together."
Douglas Bowen, president of the New Jersey Railroad Passengers Association, an advocacy group that he describes as an "agglomeration of liberals and conservatives with one thing in common, railroads," said the complaints were "political tactics from politicians woefully uneducated about public transit."
"The state Legislature, particularly but not exclusively rural legislators, see mass transit as remote," he said. "They'd rather put energy into trying to get tolls eliminated from the highways."
As for Ms. DeLibero, he added: "N.J. Transit has regained its survival instinct under Shirley. She's the first to see the need to advertise the product. She's savvy, she's open, an excellent advocate for mass transit."
Even Ms. DeLibero's critics would agree that the system she took over had big problems. Created as a state agency in 1979, N.J. Transit, which operates 1,800 buses on 154 routes and 642 trains on 12 rail lines, has often been criticized for its frequent fare increases, breakdowns and erratic schedules.
 
Fares Up, Riders Down
 During the last three years, as fares have jumped more than 30 percent, ridership has decreased by about 20,000, to 280,000 a day. Federal financing has dropped by more than a third in the last decade, to $38 million during in this budget year; the agency would be left with only $4 million in Federal aid if the President's proposed budget is approved by Congress.
Ms. DeLibero is the agency's third executive director, succeeding S. Thomas Gagliano, a former Republican State Senator who served for a year before being forced out by Governor Florio, and Jerome C. Premo, who had held a post in the Federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration.
She was wooed to New Jersey by Transportation Commissioner Thomas Downs, with whom she worked when he was director of the District of Columbia Department of Transportation in the mid-1980's and she was assistant general manager of bus services for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
The Cape Cod native -- her accent is unmistakable -- said she was drawn to N.J. Transit by the challenge and potential of the job. Fighting for money is a priority, she said, but so are increasing ridership, improving service and concentrating on finishing long-planned transfer lines in Kearny and Secaucus to make commutes to Manhattan faster.
"I think I've made a good start so far," she said, unabashedly self-confident. "I've made it a more cost-effective agency."
Mr. Downs heartily agrees. "I think it's disingenuous for people to talk about her salary when compared with other transit directors," he said. "In all the indicators that signal transit performance -- on-time performance, breakdowns and costs -- she has improved the agency. She returned $7 million to the agency last year. She's an all-round super manager."
He recalled how Ms. DeLibero impressed transportation officials in Washington by asking for money for bus parts that she believed would improve service. "She can take a bus apart and put it back together," Mr. Downs said. "Not many executives can claim that."
With her polished, television-anchorwoman looks and penchant for the good life -- she lives in posh Short Hills and drives a Mercedes-Benz -- it is hard to imagine her in hard hat and overalls. But her background is, to say the least, unusual for a top-level manager. The eighth of nine children raised in East Falmouth, Mass., she was married at 18 and began her working life at 19 on the midnight shift of the assembly line at a Sylvania plant in Needham, Mass. At the same time, she studied for her associate's degrees in engineering and business administration during the day and, after her first divorce, raised two sons alone.
"I did that for four years," she said of the assembly-line job. Eventually she worked her way up to plant manager. She switched careers after 19 years, answering an ad in 1978 for a maintenance supervisor for a fleet of vintage trolley cars on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's Green Line in the Boston area.
"Boston was tough at first,"she said. "It was very white, male, Irish Catholic. Here I was a black, woman, Catholic." She said she won the workers' respect the old-fashioned way. "I earned it," she said. "I was tested. Once they saw that I knew what I was doing, everything was fine." She jumped similar hurdles when she went to work for the Washington system in 1981, recalling when some bus mechanics in Virginia purposely sidelined a bus and asked her to diagnose a problem. "I put them in their place in no uncertain terms," she said. She fixed the bus and chewed them out.
Now one of only eight women heading transit agencies, she is usually in her office around 7 A.M. and routinely works 12-to-18-hour days. In the N.J. Transit headquarters, she is known as a tough administrator.
 
'Tough but Fair'
 "She lets you know when you've done something wrong," said Armando Arrastia, her spokesman. Insiders have also said she can be a tyrant.
"I like to think I'm tough but fair," Ms. DeLibero said, smiling.
Ms. DeLibero's challenge with legislators is persuading them to approve a $67 million increase in the $218.5 million in state aid for N.J. Transit that Governor Florio has proposed in his 1993 budget. She said the aid is necessary to avoid cuts in service and an increase in fares beyond an inflationary 3.5 percent. The move to put a storage yard across the border in Morrisville, Pa., she said, will save the company $16 million to $25 million.
Ms. DeLibero has insisted that she is doing what she can to trim her budget. "But this is a big agency," she said. "I expect scrutiny."
As a manager, she said, she prefers objective criticism to sexist praise. "Not that I mind praise," she said. "But I don't ever want them to say, 'She's charming. She's attractive. She's witty.' I want them to say, 'She's capable. She's smart. She's tough.' Those are the words I like."

The Rage Rage

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
'I DON'T KNOW WHAT to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street," the incendiary speaker announced to the media populace. "All I know is that first you've got to get mad. You've got to say, 'I'm a human being, goddammit! My life has value!"'
This populist instigator looked the viewers straight in the television eye and gave them their marching orders: "So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it and stick your head out and yell, 'I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"' 
 That speech was not from Jerry Brown or Pat Buchanan or Ross Perot. Those were the words of screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky on the lips of actor Peter Finch in the 1976 movie "Network." The message is being re-delivered in this year's campaign to "take America back" (from plundering politicians, presumably), and to return power to the "owners" of the country. Curiously, the message is not primarily associated with network broadcasters but with local radio talk-show hosts who receive not calls but call-ins, usually from irate citizens eager to sound off at the Beltway crowd, formerly the Establishment or power structure. The adjectival phrase being widely used to describe these disaffected voters is mad-as-hell.
Newsweek columnist Meg Greenfield desribed what she termed "the current rage for rage" as an "explosive, antigovernment feeling, fueled by some real and some imagined evidence of arrogance and privilege on the part of the country's so-called public servants." Another polemicist wrote that "rage is all the rage."
Whence rage? It's from the Latin rabere, "to be mad," meaning "insane"; the root also led to the viral disease rabies, and its adjective rabid. But it took the Chayefsky of his day, writing about a politician of an ancient day, to revive an early sense of the noun rage. Shakespeare's volatile Coriolanus, a military man seeking political power, used the word in this comment to his mother, Volumnia: "desire not/T'allay my rages and revenges with/Your colder reasons."
That is the sense of the noun today: "a fit of wrath, usually violent; uncontrolled anger." It is married to the verb to fly; one never enters, moves into, comes into a rage; one sometime goes into but usually flies into a rage.
But here is where the rage-purveyors and rage-knockers go wrong: A rage is not an outrage.
If you are enraged, you are incensed -- removed from your good senses -- and are consumed by anger, which causes you to be red-faced and sputtering. But if you are outraged, you have not left your senses; on the contrary, you are morally offended, distressed by some sin or transgression of justice. The Latin dignus, which means "worthy" and is the root of dignity, leads as well to indignant, and to be outraged is to be "righteously indignant."
In the synonymy of the sorehead, anger, rooted in the Old Norse for "grief," is the general term; wrath carries a connotation of vengeance; ire is intellectual anger, leading to irate and possibly related to Ireland (which would explain "get your Irish up"). Fury is interchangeable with rage, meaning "uncontrolled, destructive anger"; the Furies, in Greek mythology, were the avenging spirits bringing plagues and torment to evildoers.
Rage, as a noun, has acquired a special meaning: "fashion," as in all the rage, perhaps derived from the metaphor of a person foaming at the mouth at the high cost of haute couture. As a verb, it gained a connotation of courage in poet Dylan Thomas's poem urging his father not to yield to death: "Do not go gentle into that good night,/Old age should burn and rave at close of day;/Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
But the central sense of the word, as both noun and verb, is that of a person flipping his lid. And who is the mad-as-hell voter's favorite candidate? Uncommitted is the formal primary word, but the phrase taking outraged-politics by storm is none of the above. This term entered the language in the 1920's, along with all of the above, as part of the language of the multiple-choice test. (Only the most smug or easily pleased citizen would vote for all of the above.)
The preposition above, so often rhymed with love, has been used elliptically as a quasi-adjective and noun for two centuries. The British historian William Russell, in his 1779 "View of Society," wrote, "Just as I was concluding the above, I received yours." It was an improvement over the foregoing, which gives me fits.
 
APOLOGY OF SAFIRE
 RAGEMONGER JERRY Brown was corrected in this space for his definition of sophistry, which most of us think means "tricky reasoning," but which he defined as "to make the weak word stronger."
Classicists have sprung to his defense. In Paragraph 18b of Plato's "Apology," Socrates, the Greek philosopher, is on trial for his life and makes his defense. (The word apology meant "defense"; later it gained a connotation of "expression of regret." The formerly courageous apologist is now perceived to be not so much a resolute defender as a sleazy cover-upper.)
Socrates is quoted as telling the jury that his attackers have accused him of being a wise man (so phos) "who makes the weaker argument the stronger" -- that is, who corrupts youth by showing them how to persuade people to do the wrong thing. Many classicists think that this is where sophistry  comes from -- using skills gained by the wise to refute wisdom.
The problem is the word logos, which can mean "word" (as Jerry Brown translates it) or "argument" (as most translators prefer in this context). Barth Pollak, professor of mathematics at Notre Dame, writes: "Perhaps when Jerry Brown said, 'Look it up,' he had something a tad more scholarly in mind than a dictionary." He adds: "Mathematics, not classics, is my shtick so I'll leave further investigation to others," but, having provided the citation from Plato's "Apology," he asks, "Don't you owe one to Mr. Brown?"
Sure, and here it is. I don't get worked up about these things.

HEADLINE: Men's Style;
The Strength of Ease

BYLINE: By Hal Rubenstein

 BODY:
American Men's wear does not dazzle with range. No one attempts the scope of Armani, the hedonism of Versace, the I-dare-you whimsy of Gaultier or the deconstructivist ethic of Kawakubo. Stateside designers and their nervous backers are governed by function, guided by reality and goaded by pragmatism. With "Wear this suit, get a promotion" as the fashion dictum of the past decade, it's no wonder the local fashion press had come to watch the home team with one eye on the runway and the other on their appointment books.
But by the second day of the New York men's-wear collections last month, editors' agenda books were slammed shut. Had American designers suddenly realized that suiting up for success no longer rang true? Was it that they caught their European contemporaries dressing men more sensually and getting away with it? Perhaps they just got tired of their work looking like one another's. Or maybe they finally just decided: To hell with projections, let's design some great stuff. 
 Whatever the reasons, in the midst of a recession there was finally evidence that men's wear was no longer an afterthought or an excuse for more licensing deals. The volume of runway activity was extraordinary. But the true impact of this collective effort lay in its long-term consequences.
Where once the demarcation between office uniform and leisure wear was as impregnable as a gossip columnist's logic, a slate-wiping took hold this fall. Comfort -- what a concept -- has taken undeniable priority over power. Words like drape, hand, soft and crepe are showing up in reference to business suits. Ties are increasingly presented as an option rather than a requirement. And sensuality is no longer something that only shows up in front of Duraflame logs and on second honeymoons.
Thanks to several resolutely flattering trends, American men's-wear designers are finally admitting that clothing should really be about making one look and feel handsome rather than successful. Noting a revelation like that is worth popping the snap on a Filofax.
 
 
TAKING IT IN SHADES
 Gray flannel wasn't ignored. Joseph Abboud used it for a tuxedo. And navy was certainly present, though Donna Karan thought it most flattering hidden under layers of brown. There was flash in a vermillion stadium coat by Andrew Fezza, vibrancy in a raspberry zippered vest by Bill Robinson, pizzazz woven through Isaac Mizrahi's ties.
The pupil dilators in virtually every fall collection of note were the ensembles that presented a refined appreciation for the subtlety of color. Both Abboud and Michael Kors offered pale minus wan, with monochromatic layers of sand and caramel. Calvin Klein reminded one and all that he knows more infinitesimal shadings of walnut, taupe and anthracite (brown, tan, and gray to you) than anyone at Janovic Plaza. The photographer Fabrizio Ferri became a designer with a fluid new line of adaptable basics, labeled Industria, which are built almost entirely around harmonious camel-cream and navy-charcoal gradations.
But no one worth his weight in fabric swatches has a keener eye for color than Bill Robinson: a flash of rose unites dove gray to stone; a burnt gold shirt enriches a pecan-pie-colored suit and a barely darker knit tie. Had his career been nurtured with the precision of his color sense, Robinson might be a more towering presence in the fashion pantheon. The now ubiquitous zippered vest, funnel-neck pullover and leather duffel coat have been in his repertoire for many seasons. Critics razzed him two years ago when he showed Frye boots with his collection. Eleven pairs were counted under the first few rows at his show, and they were all broken in.
 
HOT SHOTS IN THE DARK
 The allure of dressing in the dark, which was once the uniform of Leo Castelli's SoHo All-Stars, is rooted in pure pop iconography. Everyone wants to be bad, and brooding personalities dress accordingly. The cool part is that you can do it on the cheap. But button-fly jeans and a black T-shirt are no match for the richness of tones piled on by Klein, Robinson and Basco. Abboud is the only one to make black stand out. However, Donna Karan found the right fabrics to drench in chocolate, steel gray and midnight blue, drape with swagger and revive a long-defunct word in men's wear -- glamour.
Karan's first collection last year was conceptually novel, but its practicality was elusive. What a difference a year makes. (And nobody makes a suit that packs better in a suitcase or steams out wrinkles faster.)
 
MAYBE NOT FOREVER, BUT PLAID
 Go dig out those old Pendletons from the bottom of the trunk. Basco and Fezza use almost identical plaid patterns for coats; Abboud, Alexander Julian and Robinson (most successfully with short coats) favor weaves as bright as Times Square billboards. And New Republic has managed to evoke the optic intricacy of prewar patterns without making you look like you escaped from TNT's Mickey Rooney Film Festival. Plaids look great with watch caps or newsboy caps. In fact, get a hat.
 
TOUGH LOVE
 They're serving up bravado on Seventh Avenue like toast at a caviar tasting. Who didn't do a peacoat? But a Brando-autographed copy of the play "On the Waterfront" should go to Basco, for a silhouette formed by belted leather three-quarter-length jackets, almost-swing peacoats, hooded sweaters, wool pants with high boots and nubby-as-a-hermit's-beard vests -- part Marlon, part Bulgarian postal worker, very appealing.
 
 
THE PLUSH LIFE
 Few can remember when such luxurious fabrics have so casually and distinctively made their way into American men's wear. Leather is used as effortlessly as wool. Cashmere must be the new cotton. Vests, like ties, have become an article of clothing in which even the conversative can indulge in sartorial splendor, and routinely show up in silk Jacquard, quilted suede or velvet. Abboud uses suede and flannel for tuxedos and chenille for scarves. Klein's short camel coat with its deep box-pleated yoke makes you want to walk out of a room backward. Robert Comstock has the ultimate alpaca shirt. And Karan's triple-faced cashmere bathrobe coat may compel you to cash in a CD.
 
 
LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX, BABY
 Sabato Russo sees men enveloped in an almost medieval romanticism. Michael Kors throws them into pastel jackets and tight cashmere sweats and says, "Let's have some fun." Unlike others who have created directionless lower-priced divisions to please backers, Andrew Fezza's Fez line is fresh and racy, and demands loss of body fat. Karan sees every male as a potential movie star. Comstock casts them as mountain men. But what all these designers have in common, along with a preference for tight, creaseless pants, is an unmistakable conviction that not only do men look their best when they look sexy, but they should be proud of it. In fact, the miscalculation in Isaac Mizrahi's canceled men's line was its deliberate, consciously chosen lack of sensuality. The major flaw in Klein's well-crafted re-entry into tailored men's wear was a curious lack of seductiveness, made even more apparent when he closed his show with his I'm-too-sexy-for-my-shirt parade of men in his undergarments. As for the other designers, they want American men to get noticed. "What would my wife say if she saw me dressed like that when she got up?" said a man looking at one of Karan's drapey blazers shown with form-fitting knit pants, knit shirt, woven silk tie and leather vest. "She might persuade you to call in sick," said his female companion.

HEADLINE: Freedom Fighter

BYLINE: By Trip Gabriel; Trip Gabriel is a frequent contributor to this magazine.

 BODY:
Early this April, six weeks before its most notorious citizen was scheduled to die by electrocution, the Appalachian coal-mining town of Grundy, Va., was raw with conflicting emotions. An ad in The Virginia Mountaineer urged residents to plead with the Governor not to intervene. At the same time, the rugged hillsides and deep hollows were full of rumors questioning the official version of the 1981 crime, the rape and murder of a 19-year-old housewife. Jim McCloskey had come to Grundy to chase down the rumors, because he believed that 286 miles away, in the state penitentiary at Boydton, the wrong man was ticking down the days on death row.
McCloskey is the Presbyterian lay minister and self-taught private eye who heads Centurion Ministries, a kind of charity-supported detective agency and advocacy group whose only clients are prisoners claiming they were wrongfully convicted. In the past 12 years, he and a handful of colleagues have conducted tenacious, shoestring investigations that have freed 12 men and women awaiting execution or serving life terms. The group had just scored its most recent victory -- a double play -- in March, with the much publicized release of two men falsely imprisoned for 17 years for killing an off-duty deputy sheriff in Los Angeles. 
 Two weeks later, on April 6, McCloskey was in Virginia, pursuing the case of Roger Keith Coleman, who had seemingly exhausted all his appeals and had an execution date of May 20.
The crime Coleman was convicted of scarred the soul of Grundy. The murdered woman, Wanda Fay McCoy, was a victim out of American folklore: a member of the hillbilly clan that had battled the Hatfields in the 19th century. When she was gruesomely stabbed in her home on a hillside above Slate Creek, the entire community felt violated.
Police hastily concluded she had let her attacker into her house. Her husband named the only three men for whom Wanda would have opened the door. One was her brother-in-law, Roger Coleman, a miner from across the valley, who became a prime suspect because he had once served time for attempted rape.
At the trial a year later, in 1982, the town was in a state of high agitation. After Coleman's arrest, someone had posted a sign near the courthouse that read: "Time for another hanging in Grundy." One juror supposedly had told a friend that he wanted to "help burn the S.O.B." Coleman was convicted on circumstantial evidence and sentenced to death.
But two years ago, in the 11th hour of his appeals fight, there was a startling development: a Grundy resident, Teresa Horn, said that another man had admitted to the murder. In a 1990 affidavit accusing a man named Donald Ramey of attempted rape, Horn said that Ramey had ordered her to shut up or "he was going to do me like he did that girl on Slate Creek."
Donald Ramey, it turned out, had lived in the house directly behind Wanda McCoy's. Two other Grundy women also gave sworn statements to Coleman's investigators that Ramey had sexually attacked them. None of the incidents were reported to police, and through an attorney Ramey has denied involvement in them or the McCoy murder.
McCloskey first took the Coleman case in March 1988, and over the years he and Coleman's lawyers had developed other tantalizing bits of evidence that undermined the state's version of the crime. In 1988, he uncovered a police report that stated the victim's husband, Brad McCoy, had said his wife might have taken the trash out that night, raising the possibility she was first attacked outdoors. The report also said a "pry mark" and a latent fingerprint were found on the front door. And last year, a genetic trait test, more sophisticated than tests run in 1981, showed the presence of semen from two men in the victim's body. Prosecutors have attacked the interpretation and significance of all these findings, and a succession of state courts has agreed with them, refusing to allow Coleman even a hearing on the new evidence. The sole promising lead seemed to be the reports connecting Donald Ramey to the crime.
In his role as gumshoe, McCloskey never telephones. He presents himself face to face at people's doors or at their jobs -- in convenience stores, lumberyards and auto-body shops. He usually wears a clerical collar, for the sense of authority and trust it can impart. But beyond that, there is little calculation in his approach. He stands before potential informants, a balding 49-year-old with a double chin and a bluff manner, and allows people to take the measure of him.
This afternoon, he dropped in on an unemployed maintenance man, an acquaintance of Donald Ramey's. When the man appeared at the door of his mobile home, McCloskey came bluntly to the point, saying he suspected that Ramey, whose nickname is Trouble, was involved in the McCoy murder.
Sometimes it takes repeated visits to a source, over months and years, before McCloskey ferrets out any information. But this time the maintenance man simply blurted it out: "I know that at a party one night four or five years ago when he was drunk Trouble said he had a hand in it."
McCloskey betrayed no emotion. "Did he give any details?" he asked the man, who didn't want his name to appear in print.
"I remember another boy said, 'Are you blowin' again, or are you telling the truth?' He never answered."
McCloskey, who was raised on the Philadelphia Main Line, normally speaks in a smooth and oratorical voice. But now, perhaps unwittingly, he slipped into a slight good-ol'-boy drawl. "Think back," he prodded, "and to the best you can come, tell us the exact words he used."
"He said, 'I helped them.' That's the only thing," the man said. "Someone said, 'What you talking about?' He said, 'You remember that incident that happened up on Slate Creek?' That's all he said, and walked away."
For McCloskey, it was pay dirt, an overheard admission that would probably be admissible evidence in court. It pointed toward the possible involvement of another man, even if it did not exonerate Coleman. He asked the maintenance man if he'd sign a statement summarizing what he'd said, and when the man seemed willing, McCloskey promised to type one up and bring it the next day.
By itself, the new evidence would not sow enough doubts to pull Coleman from the fire. The odds were still very long. "I know it's an extremely difficult mission, that we have an excellent chance of failing," McCloskey said later. "But I don't believe Roger Coleman is going to be executed. I think something's going to happen, some miracle."
MIRACLES HAVE A WAY OF HAPPENING for James McCloskey. The way this minister measures them, every one of his successful cases is a miracle because of the excruciatingly difficult task of convincing the criminal-justice system that mistakes are made.
McCloskey is a former management consultant who entered the seminary during a midlife crisis, and later -- motivated by a combination of compassion for those unjustly imprisoned and outrage at the system that put them there -- became a crusader. "All the sad stories overwhelm him and hurt his heart," says Kate Germond, a colleague whose job includes researching the hundreds of requests for help Centurion Ministries receives in its basement office in Princeton, N.J. The group can pursue only a handful of cases at a time, and takes only clients on death row or serving life terms.
A lifelong bachelor, McCloskey has time for almost no outside interests. When lawyers he works with fall into animated discussions of civil liberties, McCloskey's attention drifts. "The only thing I care about are the facts," he says. "Did this person have anything whatsoever to do with the crime he was sentenced for? Once we come to believe -- after a studied review of the record and long interviews with the convict -- that he's innocent, we re-investigate the case as if it happened yesterday. If we're wrong, we go away. That's happened one and a half times."
The "half" was a case in Louisiana in which a prisoner's alibi didn't check out. In the other instance, a convicted murderer, under sharp questioning by McCloskey, gave a near confession.
Many of the group's cases feature witnesses who are friends of the accused, usually in trouble with the law themselves, who years later admit they lied under police pressure to save their own skins. In the case of Damaso Vega, convicted in 1982 for strangling a teen-age girl in Monmouth County, N.J., the state's two star witnesses were Vega's friends. One was the best man at his wedding. Sentenced to life, Vega pleaded with the judge: "I will eat a stone. I will eat dust. I will eat anything worse in the world for me to prove my innocence. I am not the man."
In 1989, both the key witnesses admitted, shamefully and reluctantly, that they had lied under pressure from a detective. The detective denied it. But New Jersey Superior Court Judge Robert Figarotta found the recanting witnesses were telling the truth. Vega was freed.
In Dallas the same year, Centurion Ministries demonstrated that Joyce Ann Brown, a prostitute serving life for murder, was a victim of mistaken identity, and that a jailhouse informant lied to convict her. "She told the whole world she was innocent -- no one believed her," McCloskey says. "The prosecutors and the cops were lying! Cops lie all the time. The system is upside down!"
After a decade of probing the excesses of the criminal-justice system, McCloskey has a dark opinion of justice in America. He has learned that the police can and do coerce witnesses to commit perjury. That prosecutors can and do suborn the self-serving lies of jailhouse informants. And that defendants on the margins of society may receive sloppy and uncaring defense lawyering. McCloskey estimates that 10 percent of all defendents brought to trial for violent crimes -- rape, murder, assault -- are wrongfully convicted.
"People think we must have some special gift for weeding out all the fakers who petition us and picking the innocent ones," he says. "But it's like shooting ducks in a barrel. Wrongful convictions happen all the time."
Most of McCloskey's fellow citizens don't accept that. Faith in the jury system is close to a secular religion.
"Don't you think I know that?" McCloskey responds. "I run into that wall all the time. I see things upside down and in reverse from the conventional. I was them 12 years ago. Twelve years ago, if I'd met me, I would think: That man is crazy."
THE MAN MCCLOSKEY WOULD HAVE met 12 years ago was a law-and-order Republican who gave no thought to convicted prisoners. He was conservative, not to say reactionary. When Martin Luther King Jr. was shot, he recalls, he thought: Good, they got the troublemaker.
The son of a prominent builder, he graduated from Bucknell University and served with the Navy in Vietnam. Back home on the Main Line, McCloskey commuted to an office on Rittenhouse Square and drove a Lincoln Continental.
So far, so predictable. But by his mid-30's McCloskey had come to feel an emptiness. "My life was like a rainbow," he says. "It might have looked nice from the outside, but it was all vapor." A self-described "closet Christian," he returned to the Presbyterian church after abandoning his faith in late adolescence. At the age of 37, after a year of inner spiritual turmoil, he elected to enter the ministry.
He drove the Lincoln to Princeton Theological Seminary. In his second year, he became a student chaplain at maximum-security Trenton State Prison. There he met George (Chiefie) De Los Santos, the man who would change his life. De Los Santos, a drug addict convicted of murdering a Newark used-car salesman, insisted he was innocent. McCloskey agreed to look at the trial transcript. What he read convinced him to take a year off to re-investigate the case.
In July 1983, after two and a half years of McCloskey's legwork, Chiefie De Los Santos was freed. A Federal judge ruled that testimony by a jailhouse witness "reeked of perjury," and that a prosecutor had known it and permitted it. McCloskey's education in real-life law and order had begun.
McCloskey was convinced that his unlikely progress from corporate cog to crusader for the innocent was no accident, that God must be showing him his calling. On graduation from the seminary, he skipped ordainment and founded Centurion Ministries, named after the Roman soldier who looked upon Christ on the cross and said, "Surely, this one was innocent."
Says McCloskey of De Los Santos: "The facts freed an innocent man and gave him new life. My life was turned around by a flat-out, heroin-addicted junkie."
McCloskey went on to conduct other stunning investigations. In the case of Nathaniel Walker, convicted of raping a New Jersey woman, McCloskey discovered a 12-year-old semen sample from the victim that, inexplicably, had never been tested and was still gathering dust in a police property room. A blood test showed with scientific certainty that Walker was not the rapist, and he was freed in 1986.
The following year, McCloskey was in Conroe, Tex., where a black janitor named Clarence Brandley had been sentenced to death for the 1980 rape-murder of a girl at the school where he worked. Police had arrested Brandley, then assembled the other janitors he supervised, all of whom were white, and had them give statements in each other's presence. By the time McCloskey dropped in years later on one of these men, John Henry Sessum, Brandley was scheduled to die in two weeks. With tears in his eyes, Sessum confessed that two of the other white janitors had dragged the victim off, while he had ignored her pleas for help. A stay of execution was granted, and Brandley -- whose story was told in Nick Davies's book "White Lies" -- was eventually freed.
The publicity generated by the Walker and Brandley cases brought Centurion Ministries a modest stream of income, averaging about $140,000 a year. The full-time staff includes McCloskey and two assistants. Two other licensed investigators are retained on a case-by-case basis: Richard Reyna of Texas and Paul Henderson, a former journalist who won a 1982 Pulitzer Prize for articles in The Seattle Times that exonerated a falsely convicted rapist.
McCloskey, who pays himself a salary of $22,000, encamps in shabby hotels and dines on fast food on the road. He does not practice self-denial out of principle, but by necessity. He looks forward to the boost his income will enjoy from a movie about his career that Warner Brothers is developing. He dreams of moving into a "modest little ranch-style house" and being reunited with the furniture from his Philadelphia home, which he put into storage 12 years ago.
IN TERMS OF ATTENTION, CENTURION Ministries' earlier cases were small-time compared with the burst of celebrity that followed the recent release of Benny Powell and Clarence Chance for the 1973 killing of a Los Angeles County deputy sheriff, David Andrews. Beginning in 1988, McCloskey and Paul Henderson had pounded the pavement of L.A.'s downtown skid row and other high-crime neighborhoods in search of the original witnesses in the case, many of them down-and-outers.
They eventually found three women who'd testified for the state that they had overheard the defendants boast of the killing. In sworn statements given to McCloskey, all three recanted. They described how two police investigators, William Hall and Richard Knott, used threats and promises until the women made up stories they thought the cops wanted to hear. Hall, now a lieutenant, denies he or his partner, who has since left the force, coerced any witnesses. "Isn't McCloskey doing the same thing he's criticizing us for doing?" Hall says. "In a different way, he's putting on his collar, going down into the quote-unquote ghetto, and he's giving people an opportunity to get even with society, the criminal-justice system, the police."
Prodded by McCloskey, the District Attorney's office reopened the investigation and found that one of the central nails in the case -- the testimony of a notorious jailhouse informant, Larry Wilson -- was corroded to the core. On March 25, Powell and Chance, brought down from Folsom Prison, were together again in a courtroom for the first time since 1975. Powell, who had not seen any members of his Phoenix-based family in 17 years, searched the room for recognizable faces. Chance looked uncomprehendingly sad, his thin frame swallowed up by a baggy sport coat provided by his lawyers.
His attorney held up a photograph of a young and robust Chance before his arrest and told the judge: "This is a picture of what he looked like a couple of years before he went to prison, when he was released from the Army. The theft of his youth in this case is something that there are no words to describe."
Judge Florence-Marie Cooper of Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled that had the facts about Larry Wilson been known, the murder charges probably would have been thrown out. "The conduct of the officers in this case is reprehensible," she said.
Addressing Chance and Powell, she offered an official mea culpa: "On behalf of the people of the state of California and the criminal-justice system in particular, I offer to each of you gentlemen sincere apologies for the gross injustices perpetrated in these cases."
McCloskey and Paul Henderson were seated directly behind the defendents. Overwhelmed by the judge's on-the-record vindication of their years of legwork, both men daubed tears from their eyes.
"Mr. Powell and Mr. Chance," the judge pronounced, "you are free men."
Later that evening, McCloskey drove to a celebration for Clarence Chance, at his parents' home in the community of Cerritos. "Let me hug this guy!" Chance shouted as McCloskey entered.
"You're home!" McCloskey boomed back as they embraced in the kitchen beside a cake decorated with the words "Free at Last, Free at Last."
"It's exhilarating," Chance told McCloskey. "You can't describe it. You're free but you don't really know freedom."
TWELVE DAYS LATER IN GRUNDY, McCloskey was working the opposite end of a case -- searching for new evidence to save Roger Coleman. He was also at the opposite end of his emotional spectrum: "I'm totally depressed by the situation. All the new evidence we're developing isn't having much impact on the judicial system."
McCloskey says he is "totally, completely convinced" of Coleman's innocence, despite forensic evidence that pointed to him as the rapist and killer of Wanda Faye McCoy. A dime-size drop of blood on Coleman's jeans was type O, the same as the victim's. Two pubic hairs found on her were "consistent" with Coleman's, according to the state, and a semen sample in her vagina showed the assailant was blood type B, the same as Coleman's.
What drew McCloskey to the case was what he considers the sheer implausibility of the state's theory of what happened the night of March 10, 1981. Shortly after 10 P.M., after leaving the TJM Mines, where he worked, Coleman stopped his pickup truck to chat casually with a friend, Philip Vandyke. At the trial, Vandyke testified that Coleman seemed in no hurry to go anywhere, and they parted around 10:25 or 10:30. The state claimed he left earlier.
Coleman then drove to a trailer park, where he retrieved a music tape he'd lent a friend. Coleman testified that he then drove into Grundy, showered at a public bathhouse and returned home at 11:05.
According to the state, however, before he took his shower, Coleman made a spur-of-the-moment fatal detour. Prosecutors claim he parked his pickup at a turnout, waded across Slate Creek and walked uphill 350 yards past several homes to Wanda McCoy's. It was about 10:50. Knowing her husband got off work at 11 and would be home by 11:15, he would have had to work fast. As soon as McCoy opened the door, police say, Coleman used a pocketknife with a three-inch blade to nearly sever her head. He raped her and stabbed her twice in the chest. No one in the neighborhood saw him coming or going. No one heard anything.
"The case was built on innuendos and lies and ludicrous, insane theory that falls flat in the face of common sense," McCloskey said as he drove along Slate Creek last month. In 1988, he had retraced the route the prosecution said Coleman took -- the drive from the mine, the visit to the trailer park, the wade across the swift-running creek -- and concluded there hadn't been time for Coleman to rape and murder.
And now there was evidence that seemed to point to one or more other attackers: the sworn statement by Teresa Horn that Donald Ramey admitted the crime to her and the 1991 genetic trait test that showed the presence of semen from at least two men in the victim's body.
In March, there was a Gothic turn in the case: Teresa Horn was found dead, just one day after telling her story on a Roanoke television station. State police don't have final toxicology results, but believe her death resulted from an accidental drug overdose. Horn's family, noting that parts of her body were covered with bruises (which police say were caused by medical personnel trying to resuscitate her), suspect she was beaten and forced to take the drugs.
Many other Grundy residents seem to believe Horn did not die as authorities say. "There's a real palpable fear," McCloskey said. "It's really inhibiting us. They're all afraid they're going to end up as another Teresa Horn."
The fear was vividly on display when he dropped in on a woman who knew Ramey and said she'd recently bought a gun for protection against him. She described a visit she'd made last fall to Ramey's trailer, when the subject of Wanda McCoy's murder arose. Ramey made a comment, she said, that revealed he knew the layout of the McCoy living room the night of the murder. The admission had chilled her to the quick.
Seated on the edge of his chair in her living room, McCloskey asked if she'd sign a statement summarizing what she'd said. The woman recoiled visibly. She didn't want her name used.
"I respect that and understand that," McCloskey said. "You don't want Donnie to ever know you gave us a statement because you're afraid of what he might do to you or your loved ones." Gently but firmly, he bid her to weigh what was at stake for Roger Coleman. "On the other hand, we have an innocent man who's going to be executed."
His voice was softer than usual. "What's going through your mind and heart?" he asked.
"Fear," the woman replied. "The way Teresa got killed, I believe, was over that."
"Let's take it one slow step at a time," McCloskey said. "First, we've talked to you. Let us go away, type up a statement and see where you are at that point."
AS MCCLOSKEY traveled through Grundy, the image of another convict often pressed upon his thoughts. Jimmy Wingo was the one client of McCloskey's for whom time finally ran out. Wingo was convicted of murder in Louisiana in a one-day trial and in 1982 was sentenced to death. McCloskey had videotaped a recantation by a key witness against him, a woman who said she'd lied because a deputy sheriff threatened to have her children removed. She'd been so terrified of the deputy she even agreed to have sex with him.
On the day of the execution, in 1987, McCloskey gave the videotape to a top gubernatorial aide, who promised to review it and discuss it with the Governor. But the aide never called McCloskey back, and finally he drove to the state penitentiary at Angola to be with Wingo on his last evening. "I'm sitting with a man, so calm and full of grace," McCloskey recalls, "I'm thinking, This is unreal -- this man is going to be electrocuted."
For McCloskey, it may have been the darkest night of his life. "One of the last things he said was to encourage me, very gently, to continue working on behalf of other Jimmy Wingos."
The day after talking to the woman who said Donald Ramey revealed knowledge of the murder scene, McCloskey returned with a typed statement, but she declined to sign it. The maintenance man also decided he didn't want to sign. It was "too dangerous" to get involved, he said.
McCloskey had hoped to incorporate these and other statements into a last plea on Coleman's behalf. He had exhausted his appeals in the Virginia state courts. And in a controversial 1991 decision, the United States Supreme Court, as part of its campaign to end delays in carrying out the death penalty, froze him out of the Federal courts because his lawyers missed a filing deadline by one day. His last chance was a defiant Federal judge or Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
McCloskey has vowed that his investigation will go on until Coleman is executed or his case is resolved. "I'm giving all I have to give," he said over a dinner at Wendy's. "I honestly believe we're going to save Roger. I also know the Wingo experience. It can go the other way." But he pushed the unwelcome memory aside and forced a bit of optimism. "I'm not thinking about that now. I'm thinking about just finding people and convincing them to muster up courage to come forward."

HEADLINE: Salem Remembers, 300 Years Later

BYLINE: By MARIALISA CALTA; MARIALISA CALTA lives in Vermont.

 BODY:
"I petition to your Honours, not for my own life, for I know I must die . . . but . . . that no more Innocent Blood be shed . . . ." So wrote Mary Esty from her prison cell on behalf of her fellow prisoners who were to be hanged -- as she herself was on Sept. 22, 1692 -- as witches.
It is in documents such as these, written on fragile-looking paper in ink now faded to the color of dried blood, that the history of the Salem, Mass., witch trials was written. To look upon these documents, even from a distance of 300 years, is a moving experience. It is, to borrow from the title of a recent 300th anniversary seminar, a process of "facing history and ourselves." 
 Visitors to Salem, an architecturally austere yet inviting New England city of 37,000 situated 15 miles north of Boston, will have ample opportunity to face history this summer. A starting point is the Essex Institute, a regional art and history museum and the repository of approximately 550 trial documents. About three dozen of these papers, usually available to the public only on microfilm, will be displayed beginning June 11. The exhibit, "Days of Judgment," promises to be a dignified and sobering collection aimed at helping visitors understand the social, economic, religious and political climate of 1692 that allowed for the accusations, trials and deaths of at least 25 people.
The painful saga actually began in Danvers, Mass., a town of 25,000 west of Salem, which, in the 1600's, was Salem Village. There, in the winter of 1691-92, in the tiny parsonage of the Rev. Samuel Parris, a West Indian slave, Tituba, is thought to have entertained the minister's 9-year-old daughter, Betty, and her 11-year-old cousin, Abigail Williams, with fortunetelling, an impious and forbidden amusement in that Puritan era.
Before long, it was said, the girls were suffering seizures, trancelike states and episodes of blasphemous screaming. The village doctor, unable to find a physical cause for these attacks, attributed them to Satan. Since it was believed that Satan could exercise his powers through intermediaries -- persons at that time called witches -- the community elders began trying to identify the evil in their midst. Pressed for names, the afflicted, who came to include many more girls and young women, named Tituba and two other local women. The trials began, during which "spectral evidence" -- testimony about purported apparitions involving the accused -- played a major part. In all, more than 200 people in northern New England were accused in 1692, 150 jailed and 20 killed: 14 women and 5 men by hanging, and one man by pressing under stone weights as the court attempted to elicit a plea.
In addition, it is believed that five persons, including the infant of a hanging victim, died in prison. The episode ended some nine months after it began, when a group of ministers publicly criticized the use of "spectral evidence," and the court was dissolved.
No one really knows the reasons for the "fits" (theories have included preadolescent psychosis and ergot poisoning from a rye fungus), and for years the trials were seen as an aberration involving repressed Puritans brought to the point of hysteria through ignorance and superstition. Recent scholarship, however, has suggested that economics, village rivalries and sexism played major roles.
THE Salem Witch Trials Tercentenary Committee, it appears, has approached the anniversary in a serious manner, no easy task in a city in which a silhouette of a witch astride a broomstick is emblazoned on everything from bags of potato chips to city police cars, where the local newspaper logo is a witch, and witch kitsch overwhelms the gift shops. Even Gallows Hill, generally accepted as the site where the victims were hanged, is partly surrounded by a housing development known as Witchcraft Heights.
In such an atmosphere, it would be easy to forget, to use Mary Esty's words, the innocent blood that was shed. But the Tercentenary Committee has organized a series of lectures, dramatic presentations and workshops geared toward illuminating the past and addressing such issues as intolerance that relate to the present.
Commemorative events began last November when the winning design in a competition for a memorial to the victims was unveiled by the playwright Arthur Miller, who based "The Crucible" on the Salem trials. The design incorporates a traditional New England stone wall surrounding a small park and entered through a threshold engraved with the victims' protestations of innocence. It is to be built adjacent to the Burying Point, a one-and-a-half-acre graveyard in the middle of the city where some of the graves date to the 17th century. A public dedication for the memorial is planned for July.
No one knows where the victims were buried; some histories record that the bodies were thrust into a shallow grave in a crevice of stone on Gallows Hill, and the children of at least one victim, Rebecca Nurse, reclaimed their mother's body for secret burial near her home. Even looking at the hill from today's perspective, with noisy groups of children playing ball in a nearby playground, the traveler can imagine the loneliness and fear that those convicted as witches must have felt.
VISITORS with an introspective bent might take the time to visit Danvers, where the Danvers Historical Society, housed in a brick building from the 1930's, has mounted a small but informative display of artifacts and text relating to life in 17th-century Salem Village. The exhibit makes little reference to the trials, but helps the 20th-century citizen understand the rigors of life in the 1690's. At the society one may obtain a map giving directions to the excavation of the parsonage where the Rev. Parris lived, and the Rebecca Nurse Homestead, the home of one of the early victims. The excavation site is approached through a narrow path sandwiched between two private, 19th-century homes. There is not much to see -- two holes in the ground, one from the 1600's, the other from the 1700's -- and it takes some imagination to conjure the image of Tituba, amusing the girls in the tiny kitchen-shed during what must have been, in those cramped quarters, a long winter indeed.
The approach to the Rebecca Nurse Homestead -- an imposing clapboard structure with a large brick chimney, at the end of a dirt lane bordered by 30 acres of open fields and split-rail fences -- gives the visitor a sense of traveling back in time. The homestead, where "Goody" Nurse was arrested in March of 1692, features three restored rooms, and will be the site of several commemorative events this summer, including a ceremony marking Nurse's execution on July 19. On the premises is a startlingly authentic-looking reproduction of the Salem Village Meeting House, built for the television movie "Three Sovereigns for Sarah," where an audio-visual show will be presented beginning June 15.
Beyond the house one can find the family cemetery, with a monument to Rebecca Nurse and a stone slab carved with the names of 40 friends and neighbors courageous enough to sign a petition in her behalf.
Like the Salem committee, the Witchcraft Tercentennial Committee of Danvers has also built a monument to the victims, across the street from the site of the original meeting house. Its main elements are a granite sarcophagal box and a large wall containing the names and some of the testimony of the trial victims. Danvers is also home to the Peabody Institute Library, which houses the largest collection of books and other imprints relating to the trials in the country.
Those who find such history too dry may prefer a visit to the Salem Witch Museum, in a neo-Gothic building on Salem Common. Billed as a "multisensory presentation," the Witch Museum purports -- though the use of 13 life-size stage settings -- to enable visitors to "witness to the awesome, ominous truth." Visitors stand in a darkened theater around a glowing circle of red light and listen to a narration taped by an actor with a deep voice vaguely reminiscent of the late Richard Burton's. A rather grotesque statue of a devil with glowing red eyes is first illuminated, and actually elicited chuckles from some recent visitors, although it might frighten small children. But despite the hokiness, the Witch Museum is one of the most popular attractions in town, and does manage to cram a fair amount of history into half an hour.
Open in the summer is the Salem Witch Dungeon Museum, which presents a dramatic reading and a tour of re-created dungeon cells. The Witch House, which is owned by the city, is open from spring through fall, and is a restoration of a 17th-century home of one of the trial judges.
For all the commercializing of the folk symbol of the witch, it is interesting to note that some 3,000 followers of the religion of Wicca -- witches -- have moved to Salem, according to Shawn Poirier, a High Priest of the Seventh Moon Tradition. Salem witches, Mr. Poirier says, are working to make the city a haven for other witches to practice their religion undisturbed. The Witches' League for Public Awareness has protested the Tercentenary Committee, saying that linking 17th-century notions of devil worship with witchcraft perpetuates inaccurate, negative stereotypes.
ONE place frequented by local witches is the Crystal Chamber and Cafe on Pickering Wharf, a restaurant that features psychic readings daily and also sells various stones, potions and crystals. Another is Crow Haven Corner, on Essex Street, which was opened by Laurie Cabot, named by the former Massachusetts Governor, Michael Dukakis, as the Official Witch of Salem. The store is now run by Ms. Cabot's daughter, Jodie Cabot, and offers a wide selection of books on witchcraft, as well as potions, wands and crystal balls.
While most visitors are interested in the witch trials, those who are not will find much to admire in this small city, which was the region's busiest port during the early 1800's. This seafaring history is chronicled at the Peabody Museum in a collection on maritime trade.
Salem's 1.3-mile Heritage Trail, marked on sidewalks with red paint, takes the visitor from the National Park Service Visitor Center in the middle of town, past the Peabody Museum, the Essex Institute and the Common, and down to the waterfront, where Pickering Wharf offers a variety of boutiques and restaurants. The Salem Maritime National Historic Site offers a short slide show on the seaport and a tour of preserved buildings and wharves from Salem's maritime era, including the elegant Customs House, where Nathaniel Hawthorne once worked. Other stops on the trail include the House of the Seven Gables, the inspiration for Hawthorne's novel.
Pioneer Village, on the east side of the city, is a re-creation of 17th-century Salem, where guides in period costume demonstrate how the people of the time lived.
A walking tour called the McIntire Tour takes visitors past many of the stately, Federal-style homes designed by Samuel McIntire, one of the first American architects. Especially noteworthy is Chestnut Street, a registered National Historic Landmark, where one of the homes is open to the public.
Those who don't want to walk may take the cheerful, red Salem Trolley, which offers hour-long narrated tours of the city.
But the best way to see Salem is to travel on foot, where a visitor can almost trip over history. In the case of the witch trials, the history is not pretty, but it bears looking at.

At 32, a Shopping Center Will Grow Again

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE Meyer family goes back a long time as a Queens property owner. In 1896, Cord Meyer Jr. bought a farm in what was then called Newtown from the estate of Samuel Lord, a co-founder of Lord & Taylor. He laid out streets, installed sewers, renamed the land Elmhurst and sold off subdivisions to home builders.
The founder was the great-grandfather of the brothers who run Cord Meyer Development Company today, Charles G. Meyer Jr. and George S. Meyer. They manage the company's properties -- mainly stores, offices and Mitchell-Lama middle-income apartments -- from an office in Forest Hills. 
 Development under the auspices of this old-line real-estate investment company occurs on intermittent occasions. One such is now at hand, with the approval last month by the City Planning Commission of Cord Meyer's expansion plan for the Bay Terrace shopping center, at Bell Boulevard and 26th Avenue in the Bayside section of Queens.
Accordingly, from a company with a recent record of little in the way of new projects is coming what may well be the largest of all new commercial developments in Queens this year. The $20 million project provides an unusual demonstration of phased redevelopment in a shopping center. Bay Terrace has already gone through six stages of expansion in its 32-year history. The most recent, in the 80's, involved the conversion of a bowling alley into a 45,000-square-foot Waldbaum's supermarket.
The new Cord Meyer plan calls for building 87,000 additional square feet of space on 7 1/2 acres of land as an expansion of a shopping center that was started in 1960 and built, over time, into a center of 188,000 square feet on 14 acres.
The main element of the expansion is a new two-level structure with 67,050 square feet of shops on the lower level, its horseshoe shape facing toward the several existing buildings. The second level, on higher land at the western edge of the property, will be occupied by a new 20,000-square-foot, six-screen movie theater. In front of the theater, will be a separate parking area for theater patrons.
Loews Theaters will operate the multiplex, giving up the building at the center that it currently leases for two 600-seat theaters. Leasing negotiations are far advanced with various store chains -- the Gap, for 14,400 square feet; Ben's Deli, Foot Locker, and Lechters, the houseware chain, and others.
The existing theaters will eventually be converted to 27,000 square feet in an alternative use. Another existing building, with 21,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, will be demolished for additional parking. And in the future, 12,000 square feet of new stores and parking space will replace a gas station on Bell Boulevard at the northeastern edge of the property. The architect for the project is Stephen Sanders & Associates of Manhasset, L.I.
In all, the shopping center will grow ultimately to 288,000 square feet under the new plan. The surface parking capacity, now at 961 cars, will rise to 1,545 spaces.
"We want to provide high-end retailing -- clothes, shoes, leather goods, jewelry -- but keep local shopping and services as well," said Charles Meyer, president of Cord Meyer Development. Excavation for the new parking deck is expected to begin this summer, with store occupancy ready in the middle of summer next year. Negotiations for financing the project are under way. Base rents for space are expected to range from $30 to $40 a square foot.
For Queens, this project comes at an opportune time. Last year the value of total construction contracts stood at $700.3 million, the lowest level since 1985, according to the F.W. Dodge data-gathering service at McGraw-Hill Corporation. Residential construction in particular is depressed -- down to $29 million from $146 million in 1989.
IN both 1987 and 1988, five million square feet of new space of all kinds -- commercial, residential and institutional -- was produced in Queens, F.W. Dodge said. Declining steadily since then, the figure had reached 1.9 million square feet last year.
As brokers see it, the Bay Terrace shopping center, standing in a commercial niche of its own just east of the two 20-story towers of the Bay Club condominium of early-80's vintage, is a local facility outside the mainstream of northern Queens retailing locations. But its leasing pattern reflects the larger picture around it. Chains are on the move, the brokers say, finally finding availabilities at favorable prices in a more "reasonable" market. In one notable lease, a Staples office-furniture outlet took 16,000 square feet on Northern Boulevard, west of Bell Boulevard, once occupied by a Cadillac and Acura showroom. The broker, Steven Schwartz of S.B. Schwartz & Company of Great Neck, L.I., took the lease as evidence that because the car market is down, showroom space is now more available for retail chains.
Hard times are also putting pressure on mom-and-pop businesses, other brokers say. Rather than operate, there is a disposition by some older independent merchants to retire and rent out space in buildings they own or occupy on a long-term lease.
This has created an opportunity for credit-worthy chain operators, said Chris Conlon, director of retail brokerage for Breslin Realty Development Corporation in Garden City, L.I. It is also bringing mall tenants to nonmall Queens locations, he said. He noted the arrival of Lechters, to a 4,700-square-foot store at 31-53 Steinway Street in Astoria three months ago. Lechters also will move into a 3,600-square-foot space at 95-05 63d Drive in Rego Park when reconstruction is completed in a month, he said.
Harold Weidman, head of Store Finders, a commercial broker in Brooklyn, seconded the point. "Eddie Bauer, Dress Barn, Staples -- the large chains that had shied away from New York because of high prices -- are coming in now," he said.
APPROVAL of the Bay Terrace expansion by the Planning Commission was preceded by a long process of meetings between Cord Meyer and its representative, Scott Mollen of the Manhattan law firm of Graubard Mollen Horowitz Pomeranz & Shapiro, and local community and builder representatives. Community Board 7 supported the project by a 42 to 2 vote, and Borough President Claire Shulman backed it as well.
An earlier version of the expansion was approved by the Planning Commission a year ago, but Cord Meyer found it necessary to revise these plans to respond to merchant requirements. Part of the second floor in the new building was dropped, and the additional space was planned instead at the eastern end of the site where a gas station now stands.
The shopping center has developed in sections, with new buildings added as the market grew. The seven undeveloped acres were considered for condominium development in the 70's, but that plan was dropped, as was a plan for town houses.
For some retailers already in the center and wishing to expand, the addition is an opprtunity. For others who may lose their presence through the demolition of the existing building, it may be a setback. Operators must make considerable investment to outfit a new store, and not all of them are prepared to do this, particularly in a recession. For the expansion-minded the encouraging factor is the income level of the population living in the immediate vicinity. Median household income was estimated at $46,400 in 1990 in a population of 33,400 within one mile of the center.
In the expansion camp is Sweats Appeal, a nine-year-old, three-store chain selling camp outfits and sportswear. It started in Plainview, L.I., and now has outlets at East 88th Street on Madison Avenue and in the Bay Terrace mall.
"Recession stunted our growth," said Mark Dorfman, one of the owners. But he plans to take a 2,000-square-foot space in the Bay Terrace addition. "There's good 24-hour security here," he said. "The extra dollars a month will be worth it."

HEADLINE: Abandonment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your "Taking Steps to Head Off Abandonment" on March 29 describes a bureaucratic shellgame that attempts to repeal the laws of economics. As long as there is an inadequate housing stock in New York City to meet demand, landlords will be able to force poor service on captive tenants or charge high rents. A simpler and more straightforward solution to the problem is to stimulate more low-cost housing. 
 One inexpensive way of doing this is to establish punitive taxes on vacant properties, which contribute to urban decay, and lower taxes on other property owners. If owners of vacant properties are forced into distress sales, more attractive opportunities for private redevelopment would result.
One free way to provide more housing is selling off some chunks of the city's sprawling housing empire and using the proceeds to stimulate new development. One additional advantage of this approach is that reducing the city's huge housing bureaucracy would also allow these employees to provide more productive services.

HEADLINE: Talking: Reserves;
Keeping The Fund Up to Snuff

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
A GROWING number of co-ops are being forced to seek new ways to build their reserve funds because the traditional sources of such money -- flip taxes, rents from store space and special assessments -- may no longer prove adequate.
Revenues from flip taxes -- the charges a co-op board imposes at the time of an apartment sale -- have declined because sales have slowed. The recession has made it harder to find store tenants willing to pay good rents, and special assessments on the shareholders are difficult to levy in hard times. 
 A reserve fund is used to finance capital improvements and pay for unexpected repairs. Though some buildings operate without a reserve fund, this is considered risky by many experts.
"You never know what might happen tomorrow," said Martin Zacharius, a consulting engineer and president of M. P. Zacharius & Associates, a Manhattan firm that has dealt with co-ops for more than 20 years. "A boiler or an elevator could break down and have to be replaced. A piece might fall off the facade. A cooling tower could overflow. A lot of this isn't covered by insurance."
Moreover, relying upon banks for loans to cover such work may not be prudent for many buildings. If a long-established co-op has a small underlying mortgage and uncommitted borrowing power, it may safely assume that a loan will be available in an emergency. But keeping reserves at a minimum in the expectation that new capital may be borrowed at any time has put some buildings in a bind.
Martin Marin, a partner with the accounting firm of Marin & Montanye in Port Washington, L.I., with 250 co-op clients, said the prevailing wisdom of the 80's was to avoid dunning shareholders excessively to build reserves. Rather, it made more sense to finance capital improvements by borrowing the money as it was needed.
But bankers now say that only if a building has an underlying mortgage under 25 percent of its total market value can it borrow more with ease. And in the case of a co-op converted from a rental, at least 70 percent of the apartments must have been sold. "We're careful," said Ed Howe, vice president of the National Cooperative Bank in New York.
Some lenders also look at the financial strain on shareholders to make sure that payments on a new or larger loan will not exceed their resources, particularly in moderate-income co-ops. "We normally don't allow the debt service on any additional financing to cost each shareholder more than $50 a month more in maintenance fees," said Diane Papsidero, a loan officer with Washington Mortgage Financial Group of Jersey City, which specializes in co-op financing.
Some co-ops were loath to maintain large reserves because they feared much of the money would be taxed away. But, said Mr. Marin, there are many ways to keep the tax collector at bay.
Say, for example, the strategy was to build reserves by setting maintenance payments at a level that would produce a surplus or "profit" at year-end. The excess could, indeed, be taxed as corporate profits, said Mr. Marin, but in most buildings, the depreciation allowance would more than offset the surplus and no tax would be due.
Only if a building's depreciation allowance was all used up -- in most cases this would take 27.5 years under the 1986 Federal Tax Reform Act -- would the co-op have to pay a tax of about 30 percent on a surplus. And even this could be avoided if the building's budget clearly designated a portion of the income for future capital improvements and if the funds were placed in a separate account.
And if a board wanted to avoid tax on the interest income earned on its reserve, it could put the money into tax-exempt investments, as many buildings are now doing.
David Wagner, president of the 88-unit co-op at 150 Joralemon Street in Brooklyn Heights, said his co-op has moved most of its $890,000 reserve fund into a mix of municipal bonds and tax-exempt money-market funds.
A CO-OP'S reserve fund also may make the apartments more marketable by assuring buyers that they are not exposed to special assessments. "Many buyers are afraid to buy into a building that doesn't have reserves," said Arthur Weinstein, vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and a lawyer in private practice in Manhattan.
And it is going to be much harder to hide a lack of reserves because beginning with the next fiscal year, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants will require its members to make fuller disclosure about the condition of reserves in any annual financial statement that they certify.
The audited statement will have to include an estimate of future replacement costs, the methods by which the board arrived at the estimate and ways the board intends to finance its capital needs.
Dennis Greenstein, a New York City lawyer with 225 co-op clients, recommends that every co-op should maintain a reserve fund equal to three months' maintenance payments. The sum should be doubled if the building is over 20 years old and is in greater peril of unanticipated expenditures, he added.
THE basic way to create such reserves is to raise maintenance and plow the excess into the fund. But since this still tends to be the least palatable method other alternatives should be explored.
Selling or leasing garage or storage space is another way. Mr. Weinstein cited a co-op client in Queens that recently raised $60,000 by selling long-term leases on its 20 garage spaces.
Funds could also be raised, he said, by creating personal storage areas in a basement or by transforming unused first-floor areas into professional space.
If a co-op is close to paying off its underlying mortgage it could earmark the amount set aside for debt service to rebuild the reserve fund. Michael Cantor, president of Cantor Management of the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn, has a client co-op intending to do just that when its mortgae is paid off a year from now. This way, he said, the board anticipates having $500,000 in two years -- enough to cover the cost of a new roof and other work that will be needed by then.
If a special assessment is not feasible and bank financing is out of the question because the underlying mortgage still is large, the co-op might consider what the 200-unit co-op at 3777 Independence Avenue in the Riverdale section of the Bronx is doing.
A VOLUNTARY loan program is being set up under which 40 shareholders have agreed to lend the co-op up to $10,000 each at a market rate of interest. The money will be used for replacement windows, a new roof and other repairs, said Errol Brett, who is acting as counsel to the co-op.
Another method is to spread out the smaller capital expenditures so more can be covered by operating funds, as the 562-unit co-op at 140 West End Avenue has been doing, said Gordon Dixon, the president. So far the strategy has permitted its $600,000 existing reserves to gain interest virtually undisturbed since it was established in 1987.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
In Chicago, 'Terrific' Bargains for Renters

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
The good news, says Christine Williams, is that Chicago's residential developers appear to be holding their fire. None of the projected market-rate high-rise developments are moving into construction for the moment. The market neeeds time to absorb what is already built, she says.
Ms. Williams, vice president of the Real Estate Research Corporation, a consulting firm based here, has figures that show that new "luxury" residential construction has marched along at an average rate of 1,600 units a year over the last four years, recession notwithstanding. Five new projects with a total of 2,600 apartments have come on the market since the start of last year alone. 
 With few exceptions, these new buildings are rentals, not condominiums. And as they lease up steadily, with a nudge from a month or two of free rent, they demonstrate how a city with a fundamentally positive attitude toward new development has continued to sustain housing prices that are remarkably low by the standards of comparable cities.
Right now they are even low in relation to the cost of development. Too low, some specialists say, to sustain the mortgages that some have received.
"Chicago is a terrific housing bargain for the renter, relative to development costs and land costs, whether you're talking about San Franciso, New York, Los Angeles or Boston," said Jared Shlaes, a real-estate consultant and former developer himself. And in contrast with New York, no tax-abatement program has beeen necessary to keep market-rate housing flowing.
What people in New York City would define as middle- to upper-middle-income luxury high-rise apartments are on the market in new buildings for about $1.35 to $1.55 a square foot a month, Ms. Williams said. At $1.35 a square foot, or $16.20 a foot a year, an 800-square-foot one-bedroom apartment would rent for $1,080; at $1.55 a foot, or $18.60 a foot a year, it would rent for $1,240 a month.
Also at $1.55 a square foot, an 1,100-square-foot, two-bedroom, for example, would rent for $1,700 a month. In New York City, comparable new housing would rent for $27 to $30 a square foot a year; the 1,100-square-foot apartment would cost $2,000 to $2,500 a month.
How can the developers here do it?
One reason is that land costs are much lower than in New York City. Chicago is well endowed with well-situated vacant or nearly vacant land intended for residential or mixed-use developments. The bitter and lengthy New York battles over emptying old buildings of residential tenants with statutory rights to stay in place are unknown. The absence of rent regulation leads builders to hope that they will be able to take advantage of an eventually stronger market, whatever the level of initial rents.
In a word, development incentives are far stronger. But the competitive risks are greater.
In the mid-80's, Chicago developers were paying $12 to $20 a developable square foot for building sites. Even at the higher figure, the land cost embedded in an 800-square-foot one-bedroom apartment is only $16,000. In New York, rentals in new West Side buildings have a land cost of about $40,000 for a one-bedroom apartment. The developers paid roughly $50 a developable foot for ready-to-build land.
In addition, Chicago builders get a higher-density use of the land. Land is typically developed to a density of about 20 square feet of building for each square foot of site, a floor-area ratio of 20, under a "planned unit development" ordinance. Builders present a specific site plan for a project to the Department of Planning and Development. It is eventually voted upon by the Chicago Plan Commission and the City Council.
In the downtown area, at least, Chicago welcomes new development and favors density and height, as opposed to bulk, according to Jack Guthman, a lawyer with the firm of Sidley & Austin who represents many developers. "They are generous on F.A.R. but strict about other things -- like loading docks and parking spaces," said Mr. Guthman.
For all these factors, the supply-demand situation appears to be the principal one holding prices down. Some experienced developers say that major new projects cannot even break even at current market rents. They need rents of $1.65 to $1.75 a square foot a month for that, or about $20 a square foot a year. Accordingly, the projects may be renting at figures that in the present market are "uneconomic." Time and an upward swing in the market may change that.
But default rates on post-1980 projects that were insured by the Federal Government show that a price has already been paid for overambitiousness. At the Chicago office of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Developmeent, 17 projects out of 27 built since 1980 with Government mortgage insurance have been taken back with an outlay of $510 million from the mortgage insurance fund. The largest is the $160 million mortgage on the 2,500-unit Presidential Towers project, which is four years old and 92 percent occupied.
With mortgage rates down, some of the projects may be candidates for refinancing at more favorable rates, said Joseph Garaffa, deputy regional administrator of the Chicago office of H.U.D. Meanwhile, the owners remain in possession, hoping that with time the value of the real estate will recover.
The Government insured about 9,800 housing units in Chicago during the period, but none after 1987. About 20,000 units have been built between 1980 and the present.
The Government stopped insuring new residential construction after 1987, but major new rentals projects went forward anyway. Among those that have been completed since the beginning of last year were Cityfront Place, two midrise building and one highrise totalling 904 apartments on the large Chcago Dock and Canal Trust site called Cityfront Center in the Streeterville area just north of the Chicago River.
Other new projects are North Pier Tower on Lake Shore Drive, a 505-unit 61-story tower that has 16 floors of parking; the Parkshore, at 195 North Harbor Drive near the lakefront just south of the Chicago River; Plaza 440, at 440 North Wabash Avenue near the Loop, the heart of the business district; and Goldcoast Galleria farther north.
Cityfront Place, to give one example, is offering two-bedroom apartments with cherrywood doors, Italian marble baths, built-in microwave ovens and garbage disposals for $1,650 a month, with two months' free rent. The building has a health club, a pool, a sun deck, a party room and a parking garage for 600 cars. James Watts, the project manager, said the project is over 70 percent leased.
The latest building to go on the market is the 50-story Plaza 440, with 457 apartments. It is in a mixed-use building that has a 336-room Marriott hotel as well as a 400-car garage. Two-bedroom apartments can be rented for $1,400 to $2,000 a month. One-bedrooms are available for $1,200 to $1,300.
The developer, the John Buck Company is known mainly as a real-estate services company for corporate users -- it has taken over management of the 4.5-million-square-foot Sears Towers and will lease out 2.8 million square feet in it as Sears's merchants group moves to the suburbs. It bought the 40,000-square-foot North Wabash Avenue parking lot four years ago.
"We're the last of the new stuff," said Bill Moody, the project manager. "There will be a pause in new investment now. Real estate is battered and everyone is cautious."

Connecticut's War of the Malls Intensifies

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
FOR the last six years the wars of the malls have been intensifying in Connecticut's planning and zoning commissions and its courts.
In a major battle, the Taubman Company of Bloomfield, Mich., owners of the 18-year-old Westfarms Mall on the Farmington-West Hartford border, is determined to prevent the Wilmorite Company of Rochester from building a competing mall in Plainville, six miles away, that it feels could take up to 15 percent of its business. 
 But Wilmorite, having already won two court challenges by Taubman, is confident that it will prevail and break ground within a year. "There is more than enough market for Westfarms and us," said Alfred W. Friedrich, Wilmorite's president.
Westfarms will soon expand from 1 million to 1.38 million square feet, with a Nordstrom department store occupying almost half the new space. The mall serves Hartford's wealthy western suburbs. "If Plainville is developed as proposed, it would be a threat to traffic in the region, and a problem for our business," said Christopher Tennyson, Taubman's vice president of corporate affairs.
Plainville's municipal agencies have approved Wilmorite's plans for a 1.3-million-square-foot, $250 million mall on 77 acres, with three anchors and 225 small shops. The project is similar to Wilmorite's Danbury Fair Mall, which expanded from 1.2 million to 1.4 million square feet and is the largest in New England.
"Westfarms continues to interfere for the purpose of protecting itself," Mr. Friedrich said. "As a result our project has been slowed and subjected to unduly intense scrutiny. But Westfarms has not been successful in any litigation to date."
Last month the U. S. Supreme Court denied a petition to hear Taubman's case after the company was defeated in the Federal District Court in Hartford and the the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan.
The suit, filed in 1990, challenged the process by which the state's Traffic Commission operated in issuing a permit to Wilmorite to improve and reconfigure Interstate 84 and Route 72 at a cost to Wilmorite of $35 million.
Taubman has brought another suit in Superior Court in Hartford challenging issuance of the permit itself. "We are currently filing briefs," said Neil T. Proto, a lawyer for Taubman. "If we are turned down there is the possibility of further suits."
James Barakos, director of the Federal Highway Administration office in Hartford, said: "We have reviewed Wilmorite's road plans and approved them, subject to requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990. Westfarms has written to us here and in Washington, indicating that an environmental impact statement should be required. We don't share that view, and in any case our procedures are not affected by such communications."
MR. FRIEDRICH said Wilmorite expected to employ up to 2,000 construction workers for 14 months and eventually generate 4,000 retailing and service jobs. His company has contracted to buy the land from private owners and it has letters of agreement with Macy's and G. Fox as anchors. "An agreement with Sears is under review by the store," he said.
The Taubman Company, which built the Stamford Town Center, is busy in New Haven as well.
"They have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the city," said Sal Brancati, the city's Director of Economic Development, "to build a 1.2 million-square-foot mall over Interstate 95, connected to the existing Chapel Square Mall downtown and financed by $100 million in state bonds."
He said the state has been asked to pass legislation that would allow for sales-tax increment financing. The state would issue the bonds based on the project's ability to raise a like amount in sales tax revenues over a 25-year period, without negatively affecting the city or state.
If the plan succeeds it could kill an already stalled proposal by the Homart Company of Chicago for a 784,000-square-foot mall in Hamden, seven miles north. Homart owns most of a 34-acre parcel on Dixwell Avenue where a Sears store has been operating for decades. Recently, North Haven sued Hamden to protect its own mall, but lost on appeal.
BUT last month Hamden denied Homart's latest application, scaled down from a million square feet after a six-year tussle over size and traffic. "Homart has until mid-May to appeal the decision" said Daniel Kops, the town planner. James J. Farrell, Homart director of development, said, "we have no idea what we're going to do."
Since 1988 Waterbury has been prodding the Shopco Company of Manhattan to proceed with a proposed 1.2-million-square-foot mall to be built on 167 acres of city-owned property. "Shopco has kept up option payments on the land," said Howard Plomann, director of the Waterbury Economic Development Agency, "but they need three anchors, and the economy has not been kind to the department store industry." Shopco officials did not respond to telephone calls.
Northwest of Waterbury, in Watertown, Homart wants to build a million-square-foot mall on 160 acres. More than 800 people in the town of 20,000 showed up at a public hearing three years ago to oppose the project. After a zone change was denied, Homart sued the town and lost. The last of two appeals was denied in January.
Stanley Masayda, the town planner, said that Watertown would seek aid from the state to buy the property and develop an industrial park.
Plans for a 925,000-square-foot-mall in Cheshire, first proposed six years ago by John Errichetti, a Waterbury developer, have come to a halt after many setbacks.
Last year his partner, the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation of Youngstown, Ohio, and Nordstrom backed out.
"The region can tolerate at least one more mall," Mr. Errichetti said. "If Plainville wins out that would end it for us. But nobody knows what will happen."

HEADLINE: Why Some Love L.I. Anyway

 BODY:
JAMES L. LAROCCA, president of the Long Island Association, conceded that when a company decided to relocate "solely on numbers," the Island had difficulty being competitive.
Instead, such business and civic organizations try to convey quality-of-life factors, Mr. Larocca said, adding: "We have a highly educated and motivated work force here. Such a work force expects a higher quality of life. 
 "If you tie together our highly successful education system, the greater presence of higher education here, the abundant open spaces, the cultural opportunities, the very significant recreation sources which, mile for mile, are more publicly accessible than anywhere you can name, we can compete."
Mr. Larocca said he had been told by some companies that had moved to Pennsylvania that the employees and their families often found their new regions rather isolated compared to Long Island. "They miss the hustle and bustle," he said
Some aerospace workers who relocated to Florida, Mr. Larocca said, were at first enthusiastic about the lower cost of living and the lovely year-around climate, but soon became disillusioned and returned.
Sheldon R. Sackstein, chairman of Action Long Island, a 12-year-old group that works to keep companies on the Island and represents 250 companies with about 300,000 employees, said: "We have expertise on this Island that can't be rivaled anywhere. In addition to the excellent schools, the beaches, the educated work force, there are two national science laboratories here. We are within a stone's throw of New York City's cultural opportunities."
Because high costs for basics like electricity spur companies to move, Action Long Island has asked the Long Island Lighting Company to cut rates 10 percent for households as well as industries for the next three years. "We're running on austerity budgets, and they are not," Mr. Sackstein said. "That's wrong."
The educated work force is part of the problem, some companies say. The Jetson Direct Mail Service, which has more than 700 employees companywide, with 35 on the Island, had difficulty finding unskilled workers who spoke English, a spokesman for the company said. "Our first day in Pennsylvania we had 1,000 applicants to choose from," the spokesman added.
To address that problem, Monitor Aerospace has a classroom in its plant for the teaching of English. "Because I remember when I came here from Italy," its president, Guy Lepore, said. "I was earning $1.50 an hour, and it cost $7.50 an hour for English lessons."

HEADLINE: The 'Baby Boom Echo' Reverberates Throughout the County

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
BABIES are back. As clues multiply around the county -- from crowded delivery rooms to noisy playgrounds and even noisier real estate offices -- newly released census data have confirmed that Westchester is in the throes of a baby boomlet.
"The greatest gain between censuses was registered by the under-5 population," Westchester County planners said in a recent report, the first of a series analyzing the 1990 census. Noting that the birth rate has steadily risen in the county since 1983, planners said the number of county pre-schoolers increased 22.7 percent over 1980 figures, a phenomenon planners have dubbed "the Baby Boom Echo." 
 Although the youngest residents still claim the smallest share of the county's population, 6.6 percent, the report issued by the Planning Department said there were 10,712 more children living in Westchester in 1990 than there were a decade earlier. The children's rate of increase outstripped their closest rivals, the 65 and older set, by more than 2 to 1, the report said.
The boomlet, which was forecast nationwide, has surprised many who believed that high housing costs, the large number of working women and a trend toward smaller families would keep the number of children down. Birth rates today, while still well below the levels reached in the 1960's, are generally higher than many demographers predicted.
 
'The Yuppies Fooled People'
 "This time the yuppies fooled people," said Mary E. Carlson, the Westchester County Planner who provided the recent census analysis. "These couples delayed having babies while they both worked," she said. "They both seemed intent on establishing careers," she said, "but the money they earned was for a down payment so mom would have a cushion when she stopped work or worked less."
The boomlet is beginning to have strong reverberations in the county's elementary schools, particularly those in southern Westchester where communities with shorter commuting times are more attractive to parents with jobs in New York City.
School administrators closely watching population trends say they knew enrollments would rise, but they concede that they were surprised by the sudden numbers of 5-year-olds registering for their schools and the difficulties of predicting what may still be an uneven curve.
"Three years ago, we 'grew' 50 kids over the summer," said Dr. Stanley Toll, the Ardsley Superintendent of Schools. "Last summer, it was 0, but this winter, we added 15."
 
Changes Impossible to Anticipate
 In Hastings-on-Hudson, where administrators are preparing for 136 kindergarten children at the Hillside Elementary School this fall, nearly double the enrollment five years ago, some demographic changes are impossible to anticipate. Two years ago, the 90 members of the kindergarten class almost overnight became 102 first graders, Dr. Vincent Beni, the Superintendent of Schools said, a demographic blip he attributes to a sudden drop in mortgage rates.
Accommodating the kindergarteners has become increasingly difficult, the superintendents said, because of reduced state aid and growing taxpayer resistance to school budget increases. The most difficult issue, they say, is how to reorganize existing space.
Parents protective of their elementary school children oppose moving them; administrators mindful of state mandates requiring more diverse programs that eat up classroom space guard what is available, while voters in a difficult economy resist paying for new construction. Last Wednesday, voters in the Ardsley School District approved in a 924 to 793 vote a $3.6 million bond referendum that included $1.4 million to add four classrooms and a library to the Concord Road Elementary School. The addition was needed to accommodate a kindergarten enrollment of 150 students predicted for this fall, Dr. Toll said, adding that 100 kindergarteners greeted him when he arrived in Ardsley five years ago.
There were nine other school district votes last Wednesday, and voters approved their budgets in each case.
 
'Out of Space at Concord Road'
 The bond issue was supported by the Ardsley Parent-Teacher Association, especially by parents who feared that the alternative -- moving the fifth grade out of the elementary school -- would result in their children's being unduly influenced by older students at the Ardsley Middle School.
While many Ardsley voters said there was space available at both schools without the need for new construction, Dr. Toll disagreed. "We are out of space at Concord Road," he said last week, citing the special-education programs, computer classes and day-care programs that occupy classrooms at the elementary school.
He said he was reluctant to use any of the 13 classrooms available in the middle school that are now rented to other education groups, like Montessori and Lyceum Kennedy. The average yearly rental of $10,600, which offsets school taxes, is more than the $8,800 it will cost the district to build permanent classroom space at the elementary school, Dr. Toll said.
The bond-issue approval was critical to the school district, Dr. Toll said, adding: "We are going to see even larger school population increases. We are just beginning the trend that is going to accelerate in areas perceived as school districts of choice. No one will move to Ardsley and pay our high taxes and prices if they don't get the benefit of good schools."
 
Classrooms Added in Irvington
 In Irvington, two study committees of community residents, teachers and administrators spent months studying ways that the school district could accommodate a projected school enrollment increase generated by the baby boomlet and fueled by the construction of 267 new housing units in three major developments in the last 10 years.
Three modular classrooms have been added to accommodate an elementary school enrollment that has added 72 students in three years, exceeding school capacity. Additional modular rooms were considered, said Dr. Stephen B. Fisher, the Superintendent, adding: "Both our architect and the demographics said we would soon need 9 to 12 more modulars. Nobody wanted a parking lot full of modulars."
Hoping to avoid moving fifth graders to the 80-year-old Irvington Middle School, the school board last spring proposed a $9.7 million bond issue to build an extension to the elementary school and to renovate the middle school. In one of the largest turnouts ever seen in Irvington, the referendum was narrowly defeated by 1,182 votes to 1,293 votes.
A second, smaller bond referendum will be placed before voters in the fall, Dr. Fisher said, while the fifth grade remains at the elementary school. Meanwhile, the school system has taken some unusual steps to handle curriculum needs. To replace a music room converted to classroom space, Dr. Fisher said, "We have an electronic synthesizer that can be wheeled from room to room. It gets music to the students, but we don't like doing it that way."
Just south of Irvington in Dobbs Ferry, one of the county's smallest school districts includes one of its largest elementary schools. With 222 students in the entire high school, 610 students are enrolled at the Springhurst Elementary School with 110 new kindergarten students expected in the fall.
Four modular classrooms have not been enough to relieve overcrowding, so next year the fifth grade at Springhurst will move to the middle school, despite objections from parents. Springhurst will still be quite full, said Dr. Raymond J. Gerson, the Superintendent of Schools. "We are bursting, and even new modulars can't ease crowding in the lunchroom or the physical education and art departments." The move will help free space for the computer program, which, Dr. Gerson said, now occupies space in a closet.
In the county's Planning Department, Ms. Carlson predicted that the Baby Boom Echo would stop reverberating when Baby Boom parents stop producing children. "There's a larger pool of them to start with," Ms. Carlson said. "The cycle will level out when children of low birth years, parents born in the 70's and 80's, begin to have their children."

MUSICAL MEMORIES
Ruth and Skitch Henderson will share breakfast and anecdotes of their musical and culinary careers, and they will give a cooking demonstration for people attending the fund-raising event for the Jansen Memorial Hospice on Tuesday. Two sittings, at 9 or 10:30 A.M., are scheduled in the Zodiac Restaurant of Neiman-Marcus in White Plains. The cost is $65 a person.
In addition to their individual pursuits -- Mr. Henderson as a musician and conductor for 50 years; Mrs. Henderson as a lecturer and teacher of art, retailing and food preparation -- the couple manage a multifaceted art and kitchen-ware emporium and a cooking school at their New Milford, Conn., farm called the Silo. They have also written a cookbook together, called "Seasons in the Country," published by Viking-Penguin in 1990. Mrs. Henderson is working on a second book for Viking-Penguin, "Christmas in the Country," expected to be released before Christmas in 1993. 
 A professional chef will prepare the breakfast from the Hendersons' cookbook recipes while the Hendersons demonstrate their skills with buttermilk apple-berry pancakes and a lightly cooked compote of apples and lingonberries. A mysterious ingredient permits the pancakes to be pre-cooked without losing texture or flavor, Mrs. Henderson said.
The Jansen Hospice in Tuckahoe was founded in 1984 and serves terminally ill patients and their families in Bronxville, Eastchester, Scarsdale, Tuckahoe and parts of Mount Vernon and Yonkers. The number to call for breakfast tickets or more information is 961-2697.
 
DEALING WITH ARTHRITIS
 Arthritis is a disease that may strike children, the elderly and those in between. To help people understand and manage the illness better, the Hudson Valley branch of the Arthritis Foundation and Westchester Jewish Community Services have put together a six-part, self-help series of workshops for all ages.
Information on nutrition, exercise, relaxation, stress, conserving energy and protecting affected joints are some of the topics to be covered. Sessions will be held at the Renee Pollack Home Care and Geriatric Center at 456 North Street in White Plains from 1 to 3:30 P.M. on Mondays beginning this week. The cost of $30 includes a copy of a pamphlet called "The Arthritis Help Book." The number to call for more information or to register is 683-0842.
 
GLASNOST IN THE BRONX
 The final concert in the "Glasnost in the Bronx" series of the Bronx Arts Ensemble is scheduled at 2 P.M. today at the Russian Mission to the United Nations Residency in Riverdale. The soloist is the Russian pianist Alexander Peskanov, and the American component -- a feature of each concert -- is the world premiere of Robert Baska's Quintet for Clarinet and Strings. Paul Gallo, a Bronx Arts Ensemble member, will be the clarinet soloist.
Mr. Peskanov's program includes works by Scriabin and Shostakovich, some of them performed with the ensemble.
Tickets at $20, or $15 for students and people 65 and older, can be reserved by calling (212) 601-7399. The Russian Mission Residency is at Mosholu Avenue and West 225th Street.
 
CONFERENCE ON LEARNING
 "Meeting the Needs of Gifted Underachieving Students" is the theme of a conference to be held at the College of New Rochelle Friday from 8:30 A.M. to 9 P.M. and Saturday from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.
In spite of the attention focused on the problem by professional organizations and Federal and state programs developed to assist such youngsters, little progress has been made.
Principal speakers are Dr. Crystal Kuykendall, a Washington lawyer and lobbyist, whose subject is "Identifying and Enhancing the Potential of At-Risk Gifted Children," and Dr. James Delisle, associate professor of special education at Kent State University, who will talk about "Learning From Children."
A series of workshops will explore how children can break out of underachievement, developing strategies for working with children at risk, how to discover innovative programs and approaches, how to identify individual learning styles and how to enhance a positive self-image.
The college is at Castle Place in downtown New Rochelle. Registration costs $130 for two days, $90 for one day or $35 for dinner and Dr. Kuykendall's talk on Friday from 6 to 9 P.M. The number to call to register or get more information is 654-5336.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL ART
 Many contemporary artists are focusing on concerns for the environment in their work, creating images inspired by the denigration of the planet's soil, water and air.
"Against the Tide: Artists and the Water Cycle," an exhibition on view at the Pelham Art Center through June 27, concentrates on water and the creatures that need it to survive.
Hunched forms reminiscent of birds are the work of Mary Ting, and deformed tadpole-like creatures, dead at birth, were created by Gayil Nalls. "Investment No. 5," a vest created by Connie Jost, is covered with images of fish species that no longer exist, wiped out by pollution or loss of habitat. Judith Belzer, Noah Baen, Janet Culbertson, Jean Blackburn, Sandy Gellis, Pamela Hollinde and Michael Sandstorm are some of the other artists who have contributed unusual works to the show.
Christy Rupp, one of the sculptors, is offering a slide show and lecture on her piece, called "Sewer Fish," and on the interplay of art, economics and the environment on Thursday at 7:30 P.M. The fish has a sewer pipe protruding from its belly, through which it presumably must pass the unsavory matter it is forced to ingest.
The center is at 155 Fifth Avenue in Pelham. Information on viewing hours can be obtained by calling 738-2525.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
When a Name Outweighs a Market

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Jerrold Mitchell, the portfolio manager of First Investors Global Fund, has not liked the outlook for the Swiss stock market all year. Yet the two biggest holdings in his worldwide mutual fund are Swiss stocks: Ciba-Geigy and Nestle.
Mr. Mitchell, who is also a money manager at Wellington Management in Boston, has picked Ciba-Geigy, the chemical and pharmaceutical producer, and Nestle, the giant food company, for their international character. Just 2 percent of Nestle's business is in Switzerland. It is about the same for Ciba-Geigy. Unlike most other stocks, they depend very little on the overall performance of the economy of their home country. 
 Ignoring the influence of the domestic market can be dangerous for international investors. Generally, the performance of individual stocks is closely linked with the performance of the stock market where they are based.
Sushil Wadhwani, a strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, estimates that the performance of a local stock market can outweigh the performance of an entire European industry sector by 2 to 1. This is why two very similar companies in different countries can have very different stock performances.
In fact, investors interested in overseas stock can often do better by focusing on the country than on the specific stock or industry. But this approach is likely to be less reliable in the future as financial markets become more global. This is especially likely in Europe as the European Community expands and a single currency is created. These moves are expected to narrow the difference in economic performance between countries. Then the name of the stock will count more than the name of the country.
"We are at the beginning of that trend," Mr. Mitchell said. And Ciba-Geigy and Nestle are the kind of stocks that already can be played in that way. Of First Investors' $207 million in assets, 4.25 percent is in Ciba-Geigy and 2.55 percent is in Nestle.
He said he had thought that Sony was another stock insulated from its home market. But the collapse of the Japanese stock market proved him wrong.
So he is still giving considerable weight to a company's country. "The academics say that even with the globalization we have today, most stocks move with their market," he said. "So if we moved ahead of this trend, we could get hurt."
So far this year, Ciba-Geigy and Nestle have paid off. Ciba-Geigy is up 16.6 percent and Nestle, 14.4 percent. The surprise for Mr. Mitchell is that the Swiss stock market has moved almost exactly with the two stocks. The Swiss Market Index hit a 1992 high on Friday and is up 16.7 percent for the year.
But this only makes him happier. "We are even more convinced that these are the two stocks to own," Mr. Mitchell said. "Their value is better than the market over all. The growth is better." So he expects them to continue to perform well, while he believes the overall Swiss market will not.
Both Ciba-Geigy and Nestle have been gaining favor with analysts and portfolio managers lately. Nestle appears to be emerging from years of sluggish performance. This is powered in part by a new advertising drive intended to pick up sales and a large restructuring aimed at cutting costs. Ciba-Geigy, which has been offering the Habitrol nicotine patch for those who want to quit smoking, is emerging as a strong competitor in pharmaceuticals, Mr. Mitchell said, even though many investors still think of it as a chemical company.
In addition, the two stocks compare favorably in terms of price-earnings and other barometers of value with their rivals. For Nestle the important competitors include BSN of France and for Ciba-Geigy, Roche Group and Sandoz, two other Swiss concerns. Because of the sales outside of Switzerland, a rising dollar -- it's up 8 percent this year -- helps the earnings of both companies.
Tom Bannatyne, head of Swiss equity research for S. G. Warburg in Geneva, likes both stocks but he perfers Nestle, which recently won a battle with the Agnelli family of Italy for the right to take over the French water bottler, Source Perrier.
"It is easier to come up with a case that Nestle is cheap," he said, when comparing it with other international competitors. "It is harder to pull Ciba-Geigy apart and say you have to own it for itself." For an investor leery of investing in Switzerland, he said, Bayer, the German chemical and health care company, would be more attractive.
Mr. Bannatyne said both Swiss companies are trying to broaden their shareholder base by making their companies more accessible and their reporting more open to attract foreign investors. This is a reflection of another change that is coming slowly in stock markets outside the United States and Britain. "These are two companies which have realized that for the future they need more investors," he said.
Sylvain Massot, European food and beverage analyst for Morgan Stanley in London, agreed. "People tended to have a lot of prejudice about Nestle," he said. "Over 10 years, earnings growth lagged and the management was so secretive that you could not find out what was going on. That is changing."

After L.A., How to Revive Hope In the Inner City

 BODY:

IRA D. HALL
 
Treasurer, I.B.M. United States, Purchase, N.Y.

 We need jobs, not lectures, right now. If we took the companies in Los Angeles and we coordinated the Government training programs and the school system as well, that concerted effort would start on the short term as well as the longer term. If people from I.B.M. were asked to do whatever the community is going to do, I.B.M. would do its fair share.
I.B.M. has had a long history of job training centers. We have over 100 around the country. I.B.M. donates the equipment and sometimes also makes a grant. More than 40,000 people have graduated from these centers, and the job placement rate exceeds 80 percent. The first one opened in Los Angeles in 1968. It's in a neighborhood that was burned, but they left that center standing. That says something to me -- they valued that center as a resource.
I've been involved with the National Urban Coalition almost since its inception in 1968. I took a leave of absence to create a local urban coalition in Northern California. We dealt with unemployment, health care, education, the like. Then I went back to my regular career. I'm still on the board of the National Urban Coalition.
I was born in Oklahoma in 1944. The official policy in housing, in education, in employment was segregation. I was fortunate to grow up in a household where both parents had master's degrees. People who grow up in such households understand how hard you have to work, what sacrifices you have to make. It's hard to get it if you don't get it from your home. In the longer term people need some success models, so they can touch success, feel success, see success, imagine themselves successful.

After L.A., How to Revive Hope In the Inner City

 BODY:

RICHARD D. PARSONS
 
Chairman and chief executive, Dime Savings Bank of New York
For many black executives and business owners, the brutality of life in the ghettos commanded their attention long before the Rodney King verdict ignited the worst riots in recent history. Asking them how to bring those inner cities back to life called forth personal recollections melded with practical measures, anger shadowed by despair. 
 Their words come from interviews that began with the same question: Unemployment among black teen-agers in South-Central Los Angeles approaches 50 percent -- certainly an underlying cause of the recent strife. What is the single strongest recommendation they would make to create productive careers for young inner-city blacks around the nation?
 They spoke more of what business than Government could do; they see Government as a helpmate, not a savior. When blacks were virtually excluded from the business world they turned to Government; many are now turning back to the business world in frustration with Government. In an era when most debates about corporate obligations turn on the competing claims of lavishly paid executives and restive shareholders, all who spoke assumed that their companies have duties to their employees and their communities as well.
 There's a short-term problem and a long-term problem. In the short term, you've got to get those kids off the street. The only entity big enough to really fund a program to do that is the Government. You have to have jobs that are fairly manual, that don't require a lot of skills, almost like a Works Progress Administration effort. There are enough jobs of a public nature, rebuilding infrastructure, that if I were President, I would have my advisers working on a W.P.A.-type jobs program right now.
But that's just a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. At best, Government has been the first step on the employment ladder for immigrant groups and minorities. I worked for Government -- for Nelson Rockefeller and President Ford -- for too many years not to have some understanding of its limitations, and the vulnerabilities of relying on just one sector for dealing with the problems of minority disenfranchisement. We can't get stopped on that first rung. This is a capitalistic country, you know, and the private sector is where the jobs are.
In the long term, we have to do something about the educational system. The schools need to turn out kids who have good technical skills and good communication skills. Kids who can read, write and speak the king's English. At my bank, I need either technicians or I need customer interaction people. They need to sit across from a customer, understand the customer's needs and communicate the bank's ability to meet those needs. I've spent time with kids in the schools, and I can barely understand these kids. It's a failure of our public school system.

Figuring the Odds on Rebuilding South-Central 

"We don't want to raise false expectations and then not deliver," said Peter V. Ueberroth, former Baseball Commissioner and Olympic organizer last week. Mr. Ueberroth has been charged by Mayor Tom Bradley with getting businesses to move back to riot-torn South-Central Los Angeles. That won't be easy. Not only is the infrastructure in shambles, but many of the incentives are gone: Federal aid to cities has been cut substantially in the Reagan and Bush eras."No one can point to even one example of an area that suffered from a civil disorder ever turning around," said Chris Walker, senior research associate at the Urban Institute in Washington. For businesses, the inner city is expensive. "Security costs are higher, insurance costs are higher, borrowing costs are higher, there's an overall risk premium," Mr. Walker said. "I think Mr. Ueberroth has between a 5 and 10 percent chance of succeeding."
 
Working It Out at Olympia
 
With $18.5 billion in debt and creditors threatening to seize its assets, the Reichmann family, owner of Olympia & York, North America's largest real estate developer, is turning over the sofa cushions searching for spare assets to sell. It found a few last week. Olympia said its would sell 32.5 million shares in the Santa Fe Corporation and 25.4 million shares of the Home Oil Company of Calgary. Total? Perhaps $740 million. But that's not enough to keep the global empire intact. Olympia's $7.3 billion Canary Wharf project in London is unfinished and unrented. The company needs $53 million to keep the cement mixers running through the end of the month. So Olympia said it would do something it had never done before -- let outsiders in. It will offer its 15 largest lenders 30 percent of the wharf project and 20 percent of Olympia. The lenders, in return, would have to extend Olympia's debt-principal payments for five years, provide more cash and give the Reichmann's the right to buy back their shares.

Out of Romance, Big Bucks
 
Though not exactly literature, women's fiction -- as the genre is called -- is one of the hottest-selling categories in the publishing business. Romance sells. Last week, Barbara Taylor Bradford, a master of the craft, signed a $20 million-plus contract with HarperCollins to write three novels. HarperCollins has published the English-language editions of her entire, seven-book oeuvre, including "Remember," which is being turned into a movie. "They made me in England and the Commonwealth one of the biggest authors in the world," Ms. Bradford said.

Coty Gets a New Home
 
Japanese companies may still be in their conglomerate phase, but American companies are shedding nonstrategic assets. That's why Pfizer Inc., the big pharmaceutical manufacturer, sold its Coty fragrance and cosmetics business last week to Joh. A. Benckiser G.m.b.H., the German household products company. Pfizer will get $440 million which it will invest in promising new drugs like Zoloft, an antidepressant, and Zithromax, an antibiotic. "Coty's a strong company but it is just not fitting strategically into Pfizer's long-term strategy," said Jay B. Silverman an analyst at Nomura Research Institute. Besides, gross margins in the drug business can range as high as 85 percent.
 
Ernst & Young at Fault?
 
The question the Arizona Board of Accountancy began asking last week in preparation for scheduling hearings, was whether Ernst & Young, one of the nation's Big Six accounting firms, was negligent for failing to uncover problems at the now-bankrupt American Continental Corporation and failed Lincoln Savings & Loan. Lincoln, which was seized by Federal regulators, cost the taxpayers $2.6 billion. Both companies were controlled by Charles H. Keating Jr., the imprisoned financier, and audited by Ernst & Young. The Arizona could bar the accounting firm from practicing in the state.

Three Men and a Horse
 
It was a steep price to pay for a horse that lost 12 races in a row since capturing the Kentucky Derby last year. But Bill Condren and Joe Cornacchia bid $2.9 million for the pleasure of getting back Strike the Gold. The bidders were two of three partners in BCC Gold Stable. BCC was when a bitter feud could not be resolved between Mr. Condren, Mr. Cornacchia and the third partner, B. Giles Brophy. And who was bidding for the horse against Mr. Condren, a lawyer, and Mr. Cornacchi, a publisher of games? Mr. Brophy, of course. He stopped bidding at $2.45 million.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Calling Japan
 
A Little Help? Last week, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, got a little miffed with Japan over its hesitancy to aid the ex-Soviet Union. While Germany has turned its pockets inside out by pledging $47 billion to aid the former Soviet Union and another $65 billion to rebuild and absorb eastern Germany into its economy as well as aid Eastern Europe, Tokyo has so far anteed up a measly $2.6 billion. Mr. Kohl warned that if the ex-Soviet Union does not make it through its economic crisis, a political crisis could result. And since Russia and the republics sit at Mr. Kohl's back door, he is eager for help. "Now especially is the time for Japan, an exporting nation, to assume a larger share of the West's common responsibility and, in keeping with her economic strength, to help insure the success of the reforms," Mr. Kohl said. So far, Japan has not replied.

Franco-American Aviation
 
Back in 1946, when France and the United States negotiated a commercial aviation accord, only Pan Am, T.W.A. and Air France flew the New York-Paris route. Pan Am is now extinct; T.W.A. is, well, hanging in there, and Air France has some French competition. Ten airlines now fly between 20 cities in France and America, with American carriers capturing two-thirds of the market. So when American airlines asked for permission to increase flights by 35 percent, under the rules of the old accord, the French Transport Ministry said it's time to scrap the agreement altogether and negotiate a new accord -- one that gives French carriers a larger share of the market. The pact "is clearly no longer suited to current conditions," the ministry said.

Lights Are On at Lucas
 
For a generation of British sports car enthusiasts, Lucas Industries P.L.C., which makes automobile electrical systems, was known as the Prince of Darkness. Switch on the lights and you never knew what would happen. Not anymore. Not only has Lucas gone high tech, it's also has gone Japanese. It has been partners in a joint venture with Japan's Sumitomo Wiring Systems for more than a year. Last week, the joint venture won a contract worth $36 million a year to do the wiring for a new car to be made by Honda and British Aerospace's Rover unit.

The Worth of a Ruble
 
Every year since 1985, when Mikhail S. Gorbachev first took power in the ex-Soviet Union, the Government vowed to make the ruble convertible -- next year. After seven years of waiting, the economists in Moscow finally appear to be getting serious. Last week, the Ministry of Finance said the ruble would be freely convertible by Aug. 1. According to Konstantin Kagalovsky, a ministry economist, the exchange rate is expected to be about 80 rubles to $1. Currently, the Government sets the rate at 120 rubles to $1 -- for most transactions. But with few exports other than oil and gold, what will Moscow use to stabilize the ruble at that rate? According to Mr. Kagalovsky, the ruble will be backed by dollars -- $6 billion in foreign aid from the International Monetary Fund. For a country the size of Russia, $6 billion may not last long.

Britain Breaks Step on Rates
 
The current consensus system for setting interest rates in the European Community is simple: When Germany raises rates, everyone else must raise theirs or the value of their currencies will fall. And when Germany lowers its rates, everyone else must do the same, or their currencies will become overvalued. But last week, Britain broke with Germany's high-interest-rate policy when the Bank of England cut its equivalent of the prime rate to 10 percent from 10.5 percent. The move was made to nudge Britain out of its longest recession since World War II. The cut "will provide a useful boost to business confidence at an important time," said Sir John Banham, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business group.
 
Germany agreed last week to union requests to raise salaries in the public sector by 5.4 percent and give a $650 lump sum payment to each worker. Analysts expect that to increase Germany's budget deficit even more and put pressure on the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, to raise interest rates even higher.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Detroit Finds a Little Steam
 
After suffering its worst year ever, Detroit is finally seeing a little showroom action. Sales of North American-built cars and light trucks increased by 18.3 percent in late April, the car companies reported last week. That brings Detroit's annual selling rate to 6.0 million for the month, compared with 5.5 million a year earlier. Though still not robust (7.5 million a year is robust) it may be enough to keep the Big Three in the black. And the April sales were at better prices than a year earlier, the analysts said. Fewer cars were sold either with incentives, at deep discount or to the car company's own rental fleets. "A lot of positive things are going on that the gross numbers are masking, such as overall profitability," said Wendy Needham, automotive analyst for Smith Barney in New York. "The quality of the sales are better this year."

Going Upside on Employment
 
People in business, skeptics that they are, don't get into the hiring mood until they are sure a turnaround is real. Why bring people on just to let them go? That's why unemployment stays stuck at recessionary levels until well after the recovery is in full swing. So when the Labor Department said last week that the nation's unemployment rate fell in April to 7.2 percent from 7.3 percent the month before, it was a real upper. Even more important, the department said 126,000 new jobs were added to the payroll, the largest increase in a year. "Thank God, the economy really is finally recovering," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. "After over three years of depressed growth and recession and every kind of bad economic weather you could think of, we are beginning to move again."

After L.A., How to Revive Hope In the Inner City

 BODY:

EARL G. GRAVES
 
Editor and publisher, Black Enterprise magazine, New York
For many black executives and business owners, the brutality of life in the ghettos commanded their attention long before the Rodney King verdict ignited the worst riots in recent history. Asking them how to bring those inner cities back to life called forth personal recollections melded with practical measures, anger shadowed by despair. 
 Their words come from interviews that began with the same question: Unemployment among black teen-agers in South-Central Los Angeles approaches 50 percent -- certainly an underlying cause of the recent strife. What is the single strongest recommendation they would make to create productive careers for young inner-city blacks around the nation?
 They spoke more of what business than Government could do; they see Government as a helpmate, not a savior. When blacks were virtually excluded from the business world they turned to Government; many are now turning back to the business world in frustration with Government. In an era when most debates about corporate obligations turn on the competing claims of lavishly paid executives and restive shareholders, all who spoke assumed that their companies have duties to their employees and their communities as well.
People have to be trained. You have to have a decent educational system. We're not going to fix these schools without enormous resources and enormous commitment to do it.
What else do you do to get those people trained? Apprentice programs, like the one at Chrysler. You can go to high school in the morning, go to work in the afternoon. You can learn a skill and get credit for it. We're going to get you ready for something besides flipping hamburgers. When you graduate from high school, you're guaranteed a job.
Why can't there be apprentice programs right now to rebuild Los Angeles? It's not terribly redeeming if everyday you're looking at things that are charred and burned out. Give the training and the job opportunities to inner-city youth. You will see the light in those kids' eyes.
In construction, you can make yourself $40,000 a year if you're able to get into those industries. But either in terms of blacks in the unions or minority contractors, you could count them on one hand. If you look at New York City, the construction industry has been the most racist you can think of. There are three million black people in New York City, and you don't see them. There should not have to be a special program, but historically we have been kept out. How does a person who has been closed out catch the train when it's already left the station?

In an era when most debates about corporate obligations turn on the competing claims of lavishly paid executives and restive shareholders, all who spoke assumed that their companies have duties to their employees and their communities as well.
You have a whole generation of black youth between the ages of 16 and 21 who have never experienced one workday in their whole lives. If you have nothing to do, and no self-esteem, you affect mannerisms to try to call attention to yourself. It's also a defense mechanism: If I'm not working, you shouldn't be. It's depressing, but it's not surprising. We have to study them because they are our customers.
There's no mystery in how to get people involved in an industry: hire them. We have to train people how to come to work, be at work, give them the luxury of failure. When I started in business, I was the first black person ever trained as a copywriter in the 100-year history of J. Walter Thompson, and that was back in 1963.
I grew up in the 1950's. That was a different time. I didn't have to worry about the crowd influencing me. I grew up with a lot of rules. We pretend that the traditional family is still out there, and it's not.
I had three jobs when I was a teen-ager: a job at a newspaper, a stock girl and semi-salesperson at a dress shop, and then I went and washed dishes in a little greasy spoon. I couldn't be a waitress because they said that would be too upsetting to truck drivers. "Old-fashioned Okeefenokees," I called these people.
In the advertising business, a lot of white people were afraid to tell me I was doing something wrong. Those of us who are black have to learn to accept criticism without having a chip on our shoulders. You have to ask for criticism to grow, but you need a lot of self-esteem, because there are people who try to hurt you when they criticize.
I don't trust Government to do but so much. I don't expect them to know more than I do about how to run a business. But not everyone can afford to bring in these kids and train them, so that is where Government has a role. We hire interns, we always do. We give them real jobs and make sure that everyone has a one-on-one mentor.

When blacks were virtually excluded from the business world they turned to Government; many are now turning back to the business world in frustration with Government. In an era when most debates about corporate obligations turn on the competing claims of lavishly paid executives and restive shareholders, all who spoke assumed that their companies have duties to their employees and their communities as well.
I often ask my friends in Corporate America how they can so readily build factories in suburban Chicago, and how they can so readily build factories in Mexico, but can't seem to provide jobs for people on the South and West Sides of Chicago. We gave America hundreds of years of free labor, and yet we're sometimes 50 and 60 percent unemployed. They do not seem to be sensitive to the issue at all, even though they're taking millions and billions out of the inner-city community in sales. They turn their backs and wait for Government to do it.
Before you can ask a young man or woman to dedicate himself or herself to preparing for a job, you've got to have a job. We are one of the larger suppliers of jobs in the city of Chicago -- between 500 and 600 jobs. We're 99-percent black-owned and operated. We know the potential and capabilities of young black men and women.
We know what our customers expect from us and we're not going to shirk our responsibilities. We have a Cook County Jail program -- My Sister's Keeper. We're finding African-Americans who will meet those ladies when they come out of jail -- two women and one man who will become their mentors. It is painful for me to see my sisters degraded to that position. These women are the mothers of those kids out there with the Uzi guns.
We're also supporting a school for pregnant young girls. We have church feeding programs. And we're taking more risks to build more businesses. One of Soft Sheen's divisions manufactures most of the millions of bottles that we use annually, and we sell containers to Kraft and to other inner-city businesses. We have our own advertising agency. We're extremely happy to walk the streets of Chicago and see all our employees.

After L.A., How to Revive Hope In the Inner City

 BODY:

JUANDA A. HONORE
 
Los Angeles School District police officer; owner, T. J. Cinnamons Bakery at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, Los Angeles
For many black executives and business owners, the brutality of life in the ghettos commanded their attention long before the Rodney King verdict ignited the worst riots in recent history. Asking them how to bring those inner cities back to life called forth personal recollections melded with practical measures, anger shadowed by despair. 
 Their words come from interviews that began with the same question: Unemployment among black teen-agers in South-Central Los Angeles approaches 50 percent -- certainly an underlying cause of the recent strife. What is the single strongest recommendation they would make to create productive careers for young inner-city blacks around the nation?
 They spoke more of what business than Government could do; they see Government as a helpmate, not a savior. When blacks were virtually excluded from the business world they turned to Government; many are now turning back to the business world in frustration with Government. In an era when most debates about corporate obligations turn on the competing claims of lavishly paid executives and restive shareholders, all who spoke assumed that their companies have duties to their employees and their communities as well.
You have to start with the schooling. They need to be taught how to get the job and keep it. They have to get some understanding of what it is to interview for a job, and what they have to do to keep a job. I don't think they have a clue.
They know they need money. But they don't really understand the need to be successful. They think they can do the same things they could do when they were at school.
I've employed several students, but I haven't been able to keep them employed. They don't understand the meaning of being on time, of following through. They have the same excuses they use in school: "I forgot this, I forgot that." They use their parents for excuses. They feel it just isn't important for them to be here.
It gets to the point where either you feel frustrated with them or they feel frustrated with you. You just get fed up and say, "One of us has got to go."
You're talking about kids. Where are they going to get that responsibility from? If they're coming from disadvantaged situations, the parents haven't worked recently, so they don't have models at home. The best place has to be the school.
The schools need to teach the practical lessons. Now, you're giving them a high school diploma, but what does that mean? Nothing.
Most of them have an unrealistic idea of how much money they're going to make. If you're making $4 an hour, it takes a while before you can buy a $100 pair of tennis shoes. What's going to make you stick with it? You see your friends selling drugs or stealing, you're not going to think it's wrong if you see the immediate benefits. Most of them don't have the long-range goals. They know if I do this, I get what I want. They don't think about getting arrested.
We have a wrought-iron fence around most of the mall here, so they only started to get in. They looted the Broadway department store. Since then they have had the National Guard here.

HEADLINE: Guinness Takes a Luxury Tack

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
When Anthony J. Tennant, the Etonian who turned Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. into a world power in spirits and wines, was recruited to work similar magic at Guinness P.L.C. in 1987, the British brewer and distiller was in disarray. Its last chairman, Ernest W. Saunders, had been fired and later jailed for his part in illegally manipulating Guinness's stock price to win the 1986 takeover battle for the Distillers Company, which made Guinness the world leader in Scotch and gin. Distillers had tried to maintain sales volumes of its all-important Scotch business by cutting prices and granting a private label to any distributor who requested one. But that had only eroded market share and the power of its leading brands, which included Johnnie Walker, Dewar's, White Horse and Old Parr.
Mr. Tennant has abandoned that strategy and in the process has turned Guinness into one of the world's most profitable beverage companies. Only the Coca-Cola Company earns more in beverages. Today, Guinness is indisputably one of the most adept marketers of consumer goods around, a testimony to the power of selling liquor as a luxury rather than a commodity product. 
 Since 1987, Guinness's pretax earnings have more than doubled. Last year, when Britain and the United States were mired in recession and the war in the Persian Gulf and fears of terrorism slowed global travel, hurting the all-important duty-free business, Guinness's pretax income rose 13 percent, to 956 million pounds, or nearly $1.79 billion, on sales of just $ 7.6 billion.
Although Guinness stock is fairly expensive at $11.29 a share, or about 15 to 16 times expected 1991 earnings, many analysts are enthusiastic about its prospects. "Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!" said Christopher Wickham, an analyst at Lehman Brothers International Ltd. "You shouldn't be sleeping soundly at night if you don't own the stock."
"A lot of companies have risk areas," said Derek Brock of Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd. "This one doesn't."
While the Guinness name is still widely associated with the stout dark beer that bears its name, more than 75 percent of its operating profits now come from its spirits division, United Distillers, whose operating profits have more than doubled since 1987, to 749 million pounds, or $1.4 billion, last year.
This growth is largely the result of acquisitions made by Mr. Saunders and Mr. Tennant. Over the last seven years, Guinness has spent more than $8 billion on spirits and beer producers and distributors. Mr. Saunders bought both Bell's, the leading Scotch in Britain, and Distillers, whose brands include Gordon's and Tanqueray gins and Johnnie Walker and Dewar's Scotches.
In the last 18 months, Guinness has also purchased America's Glenmore Distilleries, a spirits producer and distributor whose Scoresby is the No. 1 Scotch in California. Glenmore has doubled Guinness's share of the American spirits market to 16 percent.
It also now owns Germany's leading premium brandy maker, Australia's most popular spirit and Venezuela's largest spirits company. Guinness is still looking for strong regional brands, both for their own potential and for the leverage they provide in marketing mainstay Guinness brands locally.
Under Mr. Tennant, Guinness has also followed its main competitors by gaining control of most of its spirits distributors, both improving its profitability and its ability to control the pricing and marketing of its brands. Such control was essential for Mr. Tennant to realize his dream of repositioning Guinness's labels as premium brands for which status- and quality-conscious consumers would pay ever more.
"The brand you drink is very much a demonstration of your life style, of your affluence," said Anthony A. Greener, who has driven the spirits division's expansion since 1987 and became Guinness's chief executive on Jan. 1. He becomes chairman when Mr. Tennant steps down at the end of the year at the mandatory retirement age of 62.
Still, expecting people to trade up to more expensive brands may have been more reasonable in the go-go 1980's than in the go-slow 90's. According to research by Impact International, the drinks industry magazine, volume sales of the top 100 spirit brands fell last year "for the first time in recent memory." The Gulf war and temporary problems plaguing some big economies were partly to blame. But David Fleming, Impact's managing editor, said: "The big question is whether it marks the beginning of a long-term trend."
In the United States, the decline in spirits consumption appears to be continuing. In Britain, consumption has long been flat. And in one big growth market, Japan, the economic slowdown seems to be taking a toll.
Other threats include rising excise taxes on alcohol in the United States and the possibility that taxes could soar in Europe: the European Community is debating how to tax alcohol in the single market after Jan. 1.
Nor can Guinness count on expanding its spirits business as aggressively through acquisitions. It has the money. "They could easily spend $2 billion on something," Mr. Brock said.
But the pickings are slim. Guinness now owns 85 percent of its spirits distributors, up from 20 percent when Mr. Tennant took the helm. Guinness would probably be barred from buying any of its major international rivals for antitrust reasons: United Distillers holds about 38 and 30 percent, respectively, of the world Scotch and gin markets.
An alliance that Mr. Tennant forged with LVMH Louis Vuitton Moet-Hennessey has given Guinness a valuable stake in champagne and cognac. Though it still lacks a major international vodka, none seems available. Grand Metropolitan owns Smirnoff and Popov and also has the American distribution rights to Absolut.
Guinness leaders confess to ambitions in liqueur and cordial companies. Obvious candidates include giant Pernod Ricard, Remy Cointreau, Campari Davide and Societe des Produits Marnier-Lapostolle. But many are controlled by families who seem to have little interest in parting with them.
There has been speculation that Guinness might copy other alcoholic-drinks giants by diversifying into new industries. But Mr. Greener, who is 52, insists that Guinness will stick to spirits and beer. "We intend to remain as single-minded as ever," he said. "The success of this company is dependent on how well we develop these brands."
Moreover, plenty of potential acquisitions remain in beer, he added. "The opportunities for growth by acquisitions are more likely to be on the beer side."
Unlike the spirits business, there are only a handful of international beer brands, including Heineken, Carlsberg and Guinness Stout. Regional brewers are plentiful and acquisition prices, which soared in the takeover wave of the 80's, have since plunged.
Ranking No. 11 in the world in terms of amount of beer sold, Guinness Brewing is fourth in operating profits, trailing only America's Anheuser-Busch, Japan's Kirin Brewery and Australia's Foster's Brewing Group. Brian F. Baldock, the head of Guinness Brewing Worldwide, cited Guinness's moves in Spain as the kind he would like to repeat. In early 1991 Guinness bought La Cruz del Campo, Spain's largest brewer. The new subsidiary then acquired control of Spain's No. 6 brewer, Union Cervecera, which expanded Cruzcampo's portfolio of brands and its reach into parts of Spain where it was weak. With Guinness's help, Cruzcampo also introduced a reformulated low-alcohol beer. Since the acquisition, Cruzcampo's Spanish share has jumped to 29.7 percent, from 22 percent.
In the United States, Guinness is taking a relatively cautious approach. Respectful of mighty Anheuser-Busch and Philip Morris's Miller, it is focusing on the imported beer segment. In early 1990, it bought All Brand Importers Inc., which raised the number of beers that Guinness distributes in the United States to 10 and more than doubled its share of the import market to 13 percent.
Even if beer is now more in the spotlight, the glory days aren't over for spirits, Guinness executives stress. They insist that they have only begun to tap the potential of whisky as a luxury item. In Japan, where gift-giving and social drinking are rituals of business life, it has become a custom to give a $75 bottle of 15-year-old Johnnie Walker Gold as an everyday business gift or to pay $400 at an exclusive bar or club for one's own bottle of Johnnie Walker Premier.
"Scotch is the major motor of our growth, and I'm sure will remain so," said Mr. Greener, who, before taking charge of United Distillers, transformed Dunhill Holdings P.L.C. from a cigarette company into a successful luxury fashion concern.
The LVMH-Guinness alliance has been a big help in Guinness's effort to position Scotch as a prestigious drink. Each owns 24 percent of the other and jointly own 14 distributors, which peddle Guinness's spirits brands alongside LVMH's cognac and champagne in the United States, East Asia, France and Ireland.
To reduce competition between its brands, Guinness slashed their number, eliminating most private labels, and concentrated its marketing resources on the regional leaders. This effort has enabled Dewar's and Johnnie Walker to to increase its share in the United States. Guinness is also making strides establishing bourbon as a fashionable drink in East Asia with I. W. Harper and in Europe with Rebel Yell.
Mr. Tennant predicts spirits sales will continue to grow strongly in Southern Europe and will soar in South Korea and Taiwan once trade barriers fall. China and Eastern Europe are potentially big markets, he added.
"In most of Eastern Europe," he maintained, "the two Western brands that are best known are Coca-Cola and Johnnie Walker. They don't currently have a great deal of money to buy Johnnie Walker but they might one day."
 
 
 
PEGGING GROWTH TO A FABLED STOUT
 Guinness's efforts to expand its beer portfolio globally by buying all or part of local brewers fits neatly into its plans to grow its flagship Guinness Stout. The world's 19th-largest-selling beer by volume, the "black beer" is brewed in 42 countries and sold in some 130.
It is typically much easier for an international brand, especially a specialty beer like Guinness, to penetrate a local market if it is distributed with a portfolio of strong local beers, said Brian F. Baldock, the Guinness deputy chairman who heads the beer business.
Revival of the brand, which had languished as a drink for mostly older, blue-collar men, began in the early 1980's, when it was repositioned with clever advertising as a fashionable drink for younger professionals.
"While the world beer market has been growing by about 1 percent a year, Guinness Stout has been growing 5 to 6 percent per annum for the last five or six years," Mr. Baldock said.
Guinness is also counting on improved taste to keep consumption of its stout growing. To that end, it has been investing heavily in refurbishing its breweries and in new dispensing equipment in bars.
Equally important is the continuing rollout of Canned Draught Guinness, which is sold as Pub Draught Guinness in the United States. Each can contains a device that injects nitrogen into the stout when the can is opened, making it really taste like bona fide creamy draught brew. Draught Guinness went on sale in 1988 in Britain, where it is now one of the top take-home brands. It is now being tested in New York, Boston and Washington as well as Canada, Germany, Spain and Australia. "Our biggest problem is capacity," Mr. Baldock said.
Guinness is scrambling to get more equipment for installing the device.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Winning Over the Community for a Mall

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
After a four-year struggle that included jousting over zoning and the complaints of abutting neighbors, ground was finally broken earlier this month for a large new shopping mall on Long Island. The opportunity for newly created jobs in a recession-weakened economy was one reason opposition crumbled. Another was the personal diplomacy of Alan Fortunoff.
Mr. Fortunoff, the 59-year-old president of the chain of houseware and jewelry stores that bears the family name, is the force behind the new mall, and he said last week in a telephone interview that he realized early in the planning that he needed to win over the community. 
 "We wanted to have the support of the local groups, rather than just neutralize them or have them in opposition," Mr. Fortunoff said. "We set out to bring them the exact details of the project. We reached out through luncheon groups -- the Chamber of Commerce and the Rotarians. And we reached out to civic associations by organizing barbecues and coffee hours in the homes."
Mr. Fortunoff has a long association with Long Island. His mother and father, Max and Clara, started the family business in 1922 with a housewares store in Brooklyn. In 1964, the Fortunoffs followed their customers to Long Island, where they built a store in Westbury. The business now has five stores in the New York area.
The Westbury store, at the site of the new mall in the heart of Nassau County, will be upgraded to be an anchor along with a new Price Club warehouse store. The 60-acre mall, to be called the Fortunoff Galleria, will expand on what was a vast parking lot for the now-shuttered 172-acre Roosevelt Raceway, which is being developed by others.
Mr. Fortunoff's original plans for the mall included upscale anchors like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, but these plans were scaled back, which solved many of the zoning tiffs.
"The biggest issue was density," Mr. Fortunoff said. "We reduced the size of the mall and came back with a project that met the code," meaning that no variance was needed.
The $194 million Galleria, which will be built in two phases, will employ 3,540 full-time workers with a payroll of some $97 million when it is fully finished in 1995.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Get a Life, They Said. And Did.

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
John Barnum-Goodfriend gazes across the table, serenity in his eyes, calm in his voice, as he describes his encounter only minutes earlier with a Manhattan tow-truck driver.
"They had just hoisted it up when I got there," he said. "The agent said, 'You had exactly 30 minutes. I observed you parking at 9:15.' " Mr. Barnum-Goodfriend looked at his watch: 9:46. "I was calm. I even waved when my car went by on 42d Street." 
 As every New Yorker knows, the towing agents of Midtown have caused more bile to flow than all the clerks at all the motor vehicle departments, post offices, phone companies and cable television services across space and time put together. "A year ago, I would have gone crazy," Mr. Barnum-Goodfriend said. But a year ago he still lived in Manhattan, worked from 6 A.M. to midnight and fell asleep worrying about the day.
Now he still starts his day at 6 A.M., but instead of flipping a switch and sitting down to plot the details of his computer training business, he shrugs on his work clothes and heads out to free the dogs and milk the goats that form the nucleus of his family's incipient cheese business. For just over a year, John and Liz Barnum-Goodfriend and her son, Adam, who is 10, have lived in rural Sullivan County, about 120 miles northwest of the city that once consumed them. "We finally left because my son said he was going to explode if we had to stay another year in New York," said Ms. Barnum-Goodfriend, whose work schedule in the city was roughly the same as her husband's. "Kids want to get outside and feel some freedom," she said. "It wasn't safe in the city to let Adam have the independence he needed."
The Barnum-Goodfriends are hardly the first people to abandon New York for a less aggravating existence. Nor are they the first to head back to the land. Along the road between the house they bid for on an impulse more than a year ago and the Victorian farmhouse they moved to and now occupy is the real site of the Woodstock music festival, a constant reminder of previous experiments in rejecting one life style for another.
But they are a peculiarly contemporary incarnation of the people who preceded them.
Like many Americans, they watched their work take on a life of its own and seep its way into leisure and family time. A study earlier this year for the Economic Policy Institute in Washington provided some statistical confirmation of the observations of the senses: One of an occasional series on people
 coping with job dissatisfaction.
Americans on average work 158 hours a year more now and take 15 percent less time off than they did 20 years ago.
In the 90's, only the superwealthy -- like Morris Smith, head of the Fidelity Investments' huge Magellan mutual fund, who announced last week that he will take a year off to be with his family -- can do what the downwardly mobile did in the 60's: leave the fast track without looking back. One weekend last year, the Barnum-Goodfriend family went out for an innocent ride in the country and ended up leaving a deposit on a house about two hours from the city. All they had to do was figure out how to make a living.

"WE both knew direct mail pretty well, tried little feelers," Mr. Barnum-Goodfriend said. He has been involved in several ventures over the years, including consulting on political campaigns; directing murder mystery dinners at Sardi's, the theatrical district restaurant, and helping organize an alternative education project, which he once tried to publicize by throwing $10,000 off the Empire State Building. Ms. Barnum-Goodfriend was a partner in a thriving medical advertising business.
Having a history of job agility no doubt put the goat venture into the realm of possibility. Liz Barnum-Goodfriend liked goats and both thought goat products had untapped possibilities. "It was the venture that clicked," Mr. Barnum-Goodfriend said.
Until Adam got out of school for the year, the entire family commuted into Manhattan every day, a tortuous odyssey that began at 3 A.M. and involved several public transportation systems. As they learned "goating" and gradually moved their city ventures into the background, they have pared back the Manhattan trips to one each week per adult. It was a trip into town to check on his computer business and deliver cheese samples to Sardi's that brought Mr. Barnum-Goodfriend to his rendezvous with the dancing wu-li masters of the city's traffic division last week. As he headed off in an aura of equanimity for the impound lot on the Hudson River, he said in some ways his days are as busy as ever: "I am busy every minute, but at least I go to bed feeling good."
 
 
 
PINPOINTING A LIKELY MARKET
 Liz and John Barnum-Goodfriend are building their life in the 90's on the mortar of the 80's: chevre, or goat cheese. Some might accuse them of hubris for thinking they could learn goat farming in 60 to 90 days.
"It was really more naivete," said Mr. Barnum-Goodfriend. "You build a barn and then you have to build a road to get to the barn. And then you rebuild the barn to conform to regulations." Like any city slicker with brains, they headed straight for the nearest agriculture extension service and talked to other goat farmers.
Because the Barnum-Goodfriends face a market already saturated with goat-cheese options, they do not plan to go curd-to-curd with well-established operations. They believe the lower fat content of goat's milk will be a selling point in health-food and pediatric markets. "There are stories without end of infants who couldn't tolerate cow's milk surviving on goat's milk," Ms. Barnum-Goodfriend said.
The Barnum-Goodfriends can't help proselytizing. Next month, they plan to start offering seminars to prospective urban refugees in search of peace and an income.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
The 90's Chain Gang, A la Mother Teresa

BYLINE: By Mary Billard; Mary Billard writes frequently about business and legal issues from New York.

 BODY:
Here's the pitch: A tough, cool James Dean character -- perhaps played by Luke Perry -- is convicted of insider trading and sentenced to work in a Bronx soup kitchen. The greedy, selfish 80's fade into the socially conscious, politically correct 90's. The plot is a metaphor for our times. Rather than warehousing people in an overburdened prison, society punishes the guilty by having them serve the community.
Judges across the country hear this pitch by a rogues' gallery of savings-and-loan culprits, tax evaders and insider traders every day. Charles H. Keating Jr.'s legal team, for example, recently argued that he be punished for his swindling ways by taking a truly grueling job at an eye clinic for five years. 
 "It sounds like a joke," says Paul Turley, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County who helped put Mr. Keating behind bars, but the defense's report "said he'd be great at fund-raising."
"What would that say to the pool of potential securities defrauders?" Mr. Turley said. "Rip off millions and millions and you may have to work as an executive in an eye care clinic. Run a cost-benefit analysis on the upsides and downsides and I'll consider doing it."
The concept that community service could replace hard time came into vogue in the 70's as a way of reducing prison costs and overcrowding. And with white-collar crimes on the rise through the 80's, a cottage industry of consultants -- teams of psychiatrists, social workers and lawyers who manufacture sentencing reports -- is booming, according to Cessie Alfonso, president of Alfonso Associates in Jersey City, N.J., and president of the National Association of Sentencing Advocates.
For anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000, these consultants will devise alternatives to incarceration including community service work and restitution and will testify at sentencing hearings. And although the Wall Street and savings-and-loan industry prosecutions are winding down, environmental cases have increased, according to John Coffee Jr. of Columbia University Law School. The defendants are middle managers responsible for environmental controls. "They are calling them, the designated felons," said Mr. Coffee. Their offer is to clean up polluted areas rather than serve time.
But in white-collar sentencing circles, lawyers, judges and probation officers cite notorious examples of limp sentencing: An antitrust violater who was sentenced to endow a chair at a university; the bribing meat packers who had to teach the unemployed their trade; the convicted slumlord who was required to live in one of his tenements, and the New York City racketeer exiled from the city.
Andrew von Hirsch, a professor at Rutgers University of Criminal Justice and author, dismisses the more high-end types of community service punishments. "It is like sentencing me to write a book," he said.
In response, new Federal sentencing guidelines requiring that most offenders receive at least some hard time went into effect in 1989. "The guidelines increased the likelihood that the more privileged do some time for the same dollar offense regardless of race, gender or class," said Ilene Nagel, a commissioner on the United States Sentencing Commission.
The guideline forced defense lawyers to retool. "Defense lawyers' big thing used to be to tell clients whether they would be 'in or out,' " said Mr. Coffee. "There is no 'out' now."
Yet under the it-doesn't-hurt-to-ask theory, the guilty keep petitioning judges for community service in lieu of walking the big yard. And even with the mandatory guidelines there is a sentencing matrix granting points based on prior records, remorse and the jackpot escape hatch for cooperation, "Section 5K1.1."
Typically, friends, family and colleagues write the judge urging leniency. Mother Teresa, for example, asked the court to show mercy on Mr. Keating, a generous contributor to her charities. Among the impressive deluge of letters in support of junk-bond king Michael Milken was one from his junior high school teacher. "He always took time out to be kind and considerate of those less successful and popular than he," the teacher wrote.
Mr. Milken's defense spent 20 pages of its sentencing memo proposing community service work in a drug prevention program in Los Angeles. Mr. Milken, who did tutoring prior to sentencing, received 1,800 hours over five years in addition to prison time and fines.
What constitutes community service is in the eye of the beholder. "Some judges make sure it is onerous. Scrubbing urinals in a public health center," said Donald Chomlee, chief of the division of probation and pretrial sentencing of the administrative office of United States Courts. "Some judges think it is a deterrent for some guy with a $500 suit -- I'm dating myself, $1,500 suit -- to give speeches at the Kiwanis Club." Ivan Boesky did volunteer work before he was sentenced at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
Even the tabloid's Queen of Mean, Leona Helmsley, asked for a stint in community service before being sentenced to four years for tax transgressions. But according to Mark Heller, the prosecuting Assistant United States Attorney, the request seemed like an "afterthought." There were no reports and no actual sponsor with a program. She received four years and 250 hours of community service. Visualize Mrs. Helmsley working as a maid in one of her hotels. Would justice be served?

HEADLINE: The Danger of Taxing Business Too Much

 BODY:
The April 19 article "Industry-Aid Bill Stirs Tax Battle" said that a bill recently passed by the New Jersey State Legislature to more equitably spread the tax burden between homeowners and industry could cost residential taxpayers "tens of millions of dollars." As the author of the Business Retention Act, I must disagree with that and point up some poignant facts concerning the bill.
As Mayor of the state's third largest city, I had to weigh arguments for and against the Business Retention Act, and I am convinced that the taxing of business machinery as real property is a very dangerous and real threat to the economic vitality of New Jersey's urban areas. 
The economic evidence supports the Legislature's action to overturn recent Tax Court decisions that would force industry to pay a higher percentage of taxes by taxing machinery necessary to production. For New Jersey to remain competitive with its neighbors in the battle to keep industrial jobs in this state, it was essential to approve the Business Retention Act.
Opponents of the measure, who say the act will produce a dramatic shift of the municipal tax burden from the industry to residential and commercial payers, are being very shortsighted. They fail to consider what has happened and what will continue to happen if industry simply closes its doors and leaves the cities. The cities will continue to lose not only ratables, but thousands of jobs as well.
New Jersey has lost 24.5 percent of durable-goods manufacturing jobs and 16.2 percent of its nondurable-goods manufacturing jobs between 1980 and 1990. Since the recession has hit in earnest in mid-1990, more manufacturing jobs have been lost and more plants closed.
The impact of those lost jobs is devastating to families and communities. Not only are income-producing manufacturing jobs eliminated, but so are thousands of ancillary service jobs that depend on a strong manufacturing base. And what urban officials must realize is that unemployed people can't pay taxes and that closed factories pay a lot less in taxes than those that are thriving.
It has often been said in this recession that the best social policy is a good-paying job. The Business Retention Act goes a long way toward insuring that people have good jobs, and that manufacturers continue to find a home in New Jersey, where they pay taxes and support the community.
Far from being a "giveaway to big business," the bill I have sponsored is indeed part of an even-handed economic development program fostered by the state. I hope that the opponents of this measure would stop their demagoguery of this issue and realize the positive aspects of pro-growth policies offered by the state.

HEADLINE: Needed: Help for Those Facing Loss of Homes

 BODY:
An April 26 article reported that thousands of New Jersey residents were losing their homes in mortgage foreclosures and that in some counties forced sales of homes have tripled. There can be no doubt that this surge in foreclosures is due principally to the recession.
At least 23,574 families were subject to mortgage foreclosure suits in 1991 alone. These are our neighbors, friends and relatives. President Kennedy once said that if a free society could not help the many who are poor, it could not protect the few who are rich. 
 Surely enlightened government in the last decade of the 20th century should be able to prevent these catastrophic mortgages without bankrupting the lending industry. Charitable organizations, which provide temporary payment schedules to members on hardship, might prove to be a workable model. Something must be done -- and now.

HEADLINE: The Jury Said, 'I'm White, and You're Wrong'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The not-guilty verdict for the police officers who beat Rodney King in Los Angeles is not justice but jive. Anyone who looks at the videotape of Mr. King's beating and says this was not a case of assault with a deadly weapon is missing a vital body nerve center. Yet it should surprise no one who has lived in this country and seen or participated in the hundreds of daily acts of division that have become politics as usual from the White House in Washington to the white houses in the suburbs. 
 White suburban juries as peers of black urban citizens? By what measure are they peers? Did this jury experience the poverty and prejudice and economic injustice that black people in the city go through every day? How could they know about informal civil rights abuse that goes with living in a poor part of town filled with blacks? Did they grow up under surveillance by the police?
The answer to these questions is "no." The white suburban jury is simply a reflection of the polarization of black and white communities over the last 20 years. Across this country white suburbs encircle core cities filled with people of color. How could any jury in any of these segregated suburban zones return a just verdict? Fear and prejudice sit smugly in their lounge chairs, safe in their sprawling suburban developments, watching everything through the surreal eye of television.
The jury's verdict sends a clear message: I am white, and you are wrong. President Bush is silent on the politics of racial disengagement. When was the last time a President of this country made a major speech or initiative on civil rights? But Mr. Bush's actions speak loudly about what he considers acceptable: from his vacations on de facto segregated white golf courses to white Kennebunkport to the $9 million fund raiser the other day, the message is clear.
The eyes of the people on the jury in Ventura County reflected the social perspectives encouraged and nourished by Ronald Reagan and George Bush for more than a decade. Their perception of Rodney King is colored by the social climate George Bush has propagated since his 1988 Presidential campaign's racist ads about Willie Horton made private white bigotry acceptable as public debate.
I grew up in a family that marched and went to jail singing "We Shall Overcome" with another King -- the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In my heart, I still want to say we shall overcome. But this verdict and these last 11 years of political and social separation make me angry and frustrated. I wonder if "some day" will ever come.

Repairing Los Angeles: High Enthusiasm and Long Odds

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
FROM the ravaged streets of South-Central Los Angeles to City Hall to the boardrooms of big corporations, there was a whirl of activity last week directed at putting the nation's second-largest city back together again.
Yet even as the highly publicized efforts were beginning, questions were being raised about whether the momentum for real change can be sustained. 
 The Federal, state and local governments began providing aid to people left jobless or homeless and to the thousands of small businesses damaged or destroyed in the spasm of racial fury and general lawlessness of little more than a week ago. Local banks promised to do their part, and most of the big companies whose stores were looted or burned pledged to return and rebuild.
Peter V. Ueberroth, whom Mayor Tom Bradley enlisted to lead the rebuilding effort, flew frenetically around the country seeking commitments from corporations to create jobs and breathe new economic life into the area.
Black, Hispanic, Asian and white residents reached out to each other to begin a process of racial healing. A cross-section of the city's residents, from the homeless to movie stars, appeared in the streets with brooms, shovels and hope.
Even the Los Angeles Police Department, riven anew by criticism of its slow response to the violence, looked forward to a fresh start under Willie L. Williams, currently Philadelphia's police chief. Mr. Williams is to take over at the end of next month from Chief Daryl F. Gates, who is being pushed into retirement because of the repercussions from the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King.
Yet for all the optimism and good intentions, even a cursory examination of the city's underlying social and economic problems made clear that there would be no quick or easy fixes. Residents and local officials here could not help but look back to the aftermath of the Watts riots in 1965, when a flurry of initiatives and governmental attention faded quickly back into neglect. It was only natural to wonder whether anything would really change this time around.
"When we look at what occurred in 1965, and the change or lack thereof in the intervening years, the questions loom very large," said City Councilwoman Rita Walters, a Democrat who represents portions of the South-Central area. Addressing the problems of urban poverty and economic development will be even more difficult now than it was 27 years ago. Because of immigration, the once-predominantly black South-Central area is now almost 50 percent Hispanic, leaving it with no unified vision of its needs. In addition, the riots were preceded by several decades of steady economic decline, as factories closed and middle-class blacks moved away.
 
Different Approaches
 Corporations, already hit hard by the recession, are not likely to locate new operations in the area without substantial tax or financial incentives. And for all the political rhetoric, it is unclear how much the cash-strapped governments will prove willing or able to spend.
Despite his efforts to dampen expectations of any miracle cure, Mr. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner who is best known here for organizing the 1984 Summer Olympics, is clearly under pressure to come up with some fast and concrete signs of progress.
Mr. Ueberroth, however, has few ties to the city's minorities, and his vision that Corporate America will thunder to the rescue does not sit well with some black leaders. They said the emphasis should be not so much on bringing large corporations into the area, but on helping local residents to build their own businesses and on giving them a direct stake in South-Central's economic future.
"I made absolutely clear to him that this was not an opportunity for white businesses to grab the land and get the credit for the recovery and then take their money out," said Representative Maxine Waters, a black Democrat who represents the South-Central area.
Ms. Waters said she told Mr. Ueberroth during a meeting last week that it is important not to allow the rebuilding efforts to wither away as they did after 1965, and that he will have to be willing to listen closely to minority voices to keep the process going.
"I let him know I'm going to ride herd on him," Ms. Waters said of her meeting with Mr. Ueberroth. "I'm going to take personal responsibility, because I'm not going to let it happen the way it did before."

HEADLINE: The World;
Food Production And the Birth Rate Are In a New Race

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
WITHOUT a huge increase in food production in the developing world, demographers are saying, millions more Africans, Latin Americans and Asians will be born in the coming century only to face short and miserable lives marked by poverty and near-starvation.
The United Nations is trying to prove the demographers wrong with a decade-long crash family planning program. But without success from such an effort, the United Nations warned last month, the world faces "four decades of the fastest growth in human numbers in all history," with its population likely to double from 5.4 billion today to 10 billion by 2050 before leveling off around 11.5 billion after the year 2150. Some 97 per cent of this increase is expected to occur in today's developing nations. 
 Such a population explosion would, of course, place immense new pressures on land, water, forests and other natural resources; it could also set off great migrations as the poor seek better lives in richer lands. And it would test anew the human race's ability to achieve a balance among its drive to reproduce, its ability to grow food, and nature's own capacity to trim back populations when they grow too large.
Two centuries ago, Thomas Malthus, the English demographer, gloomily argued that grinding poverty and famine would eventually accomplish the goal of population control -- at enormous human cost -- whenever a country's population grew faster than its food supply. In the 1950's, just such a Malthusian famine was widely expected to decimate the third world within three decades. Demographers were predicting at the time that the world's population, then about 2.5 billion, would double by 1990. The population figures proved accurate, but the so-called "green revolution" prevented famine on a cataclysmic scale.
Increased irrigation and fertilizer use, better farm management and above all the development of new high yielding varieties of wheat, rice, corn and other crops combined to produce explosive yield increases in developed and developing countries. In Mexico, for instance, wheat yields almost quadrupled between 1950 and 1980. Global grain output rose 2.6 times. Famine, once endemic to Asia and Africa, largely disappeared except in cases of war and civil strife.
"History records no increase in food production that was remotely comparable in scale, speed, spread or duration," the British economist Michael Lipton wrote in "New Seeds and Poor People," a study of the green revolution.
 
Harder This Time
 But now, with the global population continuing to explode, there is widespread agreement among agricultural experts that engineering a second green revolution is going to be harder than the first one. "It will be more difficult this time, though I still think we can do it with luck and good policies," said Stephen A. Vosti of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington. This means developing governments must pursue different goals simultaneously, making agriculture both more productive and environmentally sustainable while helping the rural poor earn money to improve their diet.
In earlier centuries food production was kept in line with population mainly by bringing more land under cultivation. But most of the world's arable land is in use, and even more intensive farming seems the only way to raise output. However, there is growing concern over environmental consequences of such farming and fears that much higher yields may not be sustainable. As Uma Lele of the University of Florida told a recent Rockefeller Foundation seminar on future food needs, "worries about environmental sustainability are weakening the intellectual foundations of the green revolution."
After explosive growth in recent decades, crop yields are rising more slowly or sometimes declining in many parts of the developing world, often because lack of water, deteriorating soil and urban advances force farmers to reduce cultivation. In four Indian villages surveyed by the food policy institute, high soil salinity caused by too much irrigation has forced farmers to leave one-quarter of their land fallow.
Biotechnology may eventually produce crop strains that are more disease resistant and better adapted to arid climes. But such breakthroughs remain in the future. Meanwhile, some environmentalists say Earth is approaching its maximum carrying load and its depleted soil and water resources cannot support another doubling of the population.
"I doubt we'll ever see 11 billion people because that is beyond the third world's agricultural capacity," says Lester R. Brown of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington.
Optimists believe that few agricultural areas are producing close to their theoretical limits, leaving room for a second big leap in food output. In 1979, Dutch scientists calculated the maximum possible annual crop yield at about 18,000 pounds of grain an acre in Latin America, 14,000 pounds in Africa, 13,000 pounds in Asia and between 10,000 and 11,000 pounds in North America, Europe and Australia. But according to Donald L. Plucknett, scientific adviser to the Consultative Group on Agricultural Research, which encourages development of more productive strains of crops, African grain yields an average of only about 800 to 1,200 pounds an acre outside the modern farms of Zimbabwe and South Africa.
 
Room for Growth?
 In Asia, yields on good lands have climbed as high as 5,000 to 6,000 pounds an acre but many pockets remain in the 1,000-to 1,500-pound area. In South America, some areas yield up to 5,000 pounds but others produce far less. Meanwhile, the United States and Europe pay farmers to take land out of production because of surplus stocks, while the farming potential of the lands that made up the Soviet Union is underexploited. "There is room for much more production with new genetic materials, improved management and more fertilizer use," Dr. Plucknett argues.
After Malthus predicted perpetual hunger and poverty in England as a growing population bumped against the limits of available food supply, the Industrial Revolution proved him wrong by raising living standards and encouraging smaller families and better farming. Economists hoped the first green revolution would do the same in the third world, providing what Dr. Lipton calls "a breathing space" from famine during which economic development and falling food prices would reduce poverty and cut the birth rate.
But that never happened, and the number of poor and hungry in the world continues to rise. The lesson of that first green revolution is that without smaller families many poor people may still lack money to buy the produce of a second green revolution -- when it comes.

HEADLINE: May 3-9: The Economy;
Unemployment Down, Payrolls Up - But Not by Much

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
For months the question among economic policymakers was whether the occasional signs of recovery were robins that portended a new spring. While last week's economic reports added further evidence that the season has indeed arrived, the problem is that it does not appear nearly as sunny as economists or Bush Administration officials would like. Most economists forecast growth of a moderate 2 to 3 percent this year; the average growth rate in the first year after other postwar recessions was a robust 6 percent. 
 The best economic news of the week came Friday, when the Labor Department announced that the statistic the public watches most closely, the jobless rate, fell in April for the first time in nine months. The rate dropped to 7.2 percent, from 7.3 percent in March, but remained well above the 5.4 percent it had been when President Bush took office. Payrolls jumped by 126,000 workers, and most companies said they were adding employees. Still, statisticians saw some weakness in the jobs report: average hourly earnings slipped and the average work week grew shorter in April.
Other good news was that sales of American-made cars rose 7 percent in April over the previous April, although car sales remain weak.
A Federal Reserve survey last week showed that the economy was picking up slowly, led by a resurgence in manufacturing. The following day, 14 leading retailers said sales grew modestly in April.
Not bad, all in all, but not brilliant. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the economy was improving, but added, "I would scarcely argue, however, that we are anywhere near back to normal."

HEADLINE: More Offices Are Shedding the Suit

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
WHEN the air-conditioning at L & F Products broke down last summer and the company was told it would take three weeks to fix it, Michael R. Gallagher started a small revolution.
Contemplating visions of middle managers sweating in the company's sealed office building in Montvale, N.J., Mr. Gallagher, the president, suggested that everyone come to work in chinos and polo shirts. 
 The air-conditioning is back on, but L & F employees are still dressing casually -- khakis, sportcoats, chambray shirts. "People's attitudes seemed to improve, there was more give-and-take and our productivity increased," said Mr. Gallagher, whose company makes Lysol, Ogilvie home permanents and other household items.
A growing number of companies, and not just computer designers and youthful advertising agencies, have adopted more informal standards. The look is what the fashion trade calls "business casual." Cut-offs and ripped t-shirts aren't in, but neither are wool suits or ties. Alcoa, the aluminum giant, has the look, as does the BIC Corporation. Citibank's marketing department has "casual days."
And, as bits of corporate America shed the suit, makers of tailored clothing are hurting. Sales of the traditional suit -- a jacket and pants cut from the same fabric and sold with the assumption that a tailor will make alterations -- have slumped, while sales of knit shirts are up. Levi Strauss & Company sold a record $850 million worth of casual twill trousers last year as Brooks Brothers' profits plummeted 50 percent.
"We're reducing our overall manufacturing capacity so that I don't have to try to sell suits into this tough environment," said Michael Sandler, vice president of merchandise and product development at the Greiff Companies, which makes men's suits for Perry Ellis, Ralph Lauren's Polo University and other labels.
Recessionary layoffs among lawyers, bankers and stockbrokers help explain the drop in sales. So do suit prices. Levi's Dockers pants sell for about $40 and a sportcoat costs about $250. But the cheapest line that Hartmarx, a major suit manufacturer, makes for full-price retailers sells for $450, and its Hickey-Freeman line retails for up to $1,250. Designer suits cost far more. Prices jumped with the price of wool in the late 1980's and have stayed up.
The increasing economic importance of Florida, southern California and other states where wearing wool suits borders on insanity has added to the malaise for manufacturers.
And the entry of women into the workplace has changed men's attitudes. Women have more choice in office attire, wearing suits, dresses and trousers in a wide variety of fabrics and colors. Now men want some of the same.
"Until the last few years, about the only choice men have had is, 'Do you wear cuffs or don't you?' " said Lynn Shnurnberger, a fashion historian and author of "Let There Be Clothes."
But women who can sport "business casual" embrace it as eagerly as their male colleagues. "You don't have to wear pantyhose in the summer," said Julie Sweeney, a category manager at L & F in a chambray shirt and khakis. "And my dry-cleaning bills have certainly gone down."
Fashion experts say the shift reflects a fundamental change in lifestyle -- now that those making the change can finally dare to make it. "The guy who was part of the jeans generation in the 1970's wasn't interested in wearing a wool flannel suit," said Alan G. Millstein, publisher of the Fashion Network Report. "He may have had to when he started his career, but now he's running the corporation."
Someone like Bruno Bich, perhaps. "There's something strange about putting a tie around your windpipe," said Mr. Bich, the 45-year-old chairman of the BIC Corporation, where the engineers and sales people behind disposable pens, lighters and shavers have disposed of their neckwear too. They say creativity is enhanced.
Dominick Pisciotta, a senior product manager at L & F, said, "People tend to forget about who's the boss and who's the employee when everyone is wearing loafers and polo shirts."
But fashion authorities say the tailored suit still isn't at any risk of going the way of wide ties, Nehru jackets and the Full Cleveland (leisure suit with white belt and shoes).
"I was at the Harvard Club the other day and, believe me, they're still wearing tailored suits," said Ms. Shnurnberger. "Of course, they're still eating fried crabcakes and canned peas, too."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Concern, Cash, But No Accord On Urban Woes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Despite trillions of dollars spent over the years on thousands of different Government social programs, politicians and scholars are no closer to agreement today than they were a generation ago about the best ways to lift people out of poverty and make the cities better places to live.
Experts at universities and research institutes and in Government agree that if a consensus could be reached about which programs have worked, the country would embrace those solutions, regardless of cost. But enormous ideological and political differences inhibit such a consensus, and the gulf has widened in the aftermath of the riots in Los Angeles. 
 "The problem all along," said Donald F. Kettl, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, "is that we cannot agree on what it means that something works or doesn't work. The goals are always multiple and confused and vague. Conservatives look at it from one perspective, liberals from another. What people at the national level thought were mistakes, people at the local level often liked. Everything is just much more complicated than we ever thought."
In a few instances over the years a consensus emerged about what needed to be done, and in those cases the country responded. Take the elderly.
 
Better Off Now? Much.
 Thirty years ago, half of all Americans over 65 had no medical insurance, a third of the aged lived in poverty and millions avoided destitution only by living with their children.
Since then, with little complaint or political controversy, people's taxes have been repeatedly raised and the money has been spent on the elderly to the point where Social Security retirement benefits, health insurance under Medicare, nursing home payments under Medicaid and additional income supplements to the aged poor amount to well over one-third of the entire Federal budget.
Today, nearly everyone over 65 has medical insurance, the poverty rate among the elderly is substantially lower than it is for Americans as a whole and a vast majority of older people are financially self-sufficient.
The attacks from the Bush Administration in the last week to the contrary, the programs of the 1960's and 1970's have had other distinct successes.
 
Black Political Power
 Before the civil rights laws of 1964 and 1965, no major American city had ever had a black mayor, and there were only a couple of hundred black elected officials nationwide at all levels of government. More than 90 percent of the black adults in some cities were not registered to vote.
Now, blacks vote in about the same proportion as whites, and New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta and Cleveland are among the many cities that have or have had black mayors.
In the early 60's, only one-third of the children 3 to 5 years old attended nursery school or kindergarten. Now, preschool programs are available to almost all children those ages.
Still, few people would argue that the nation's cities are better off. Old problems like poverty, crime, illegitimacy and violence seem to have worsened. New plagues like AIDS, crack and homelessness are pervasive.
So if the social programs succeeded in some respects, they failed in many others. More important, central questions increasingly seem to become irreconcilable the longer they are debated: how to strike a balance between work and welfare, to insure poor children a solid education, to put the jobless to work, to provide adequate housing for all, to fight crime while preserving civil liberties.
 
Leaders Are at a Loss
 Americans and the politicians they elect would love to have the inner cities flourish and to allow the people who live there to enjoy the fruits that nourish most Americans, said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief staff economist.
The difficulty, said Mr. Reischauer, whose academic specialty is social policy, is that no one knows how to do it. "The economic and demographic and political forces that have been undermining the vitality of our inner cities are so overwhelming," he said, "that policies of the sort we've engaged in really can't stem the tide."
Nearly all politicians and scholars agree that the main Federal welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, has been at best seriously flawed and at worst disastrous. Almost no one defends rules that force families to split to qualify for welfare or that require families to be on welfare before they are eligible for Medicaid, the health care program for the poor.
But conservatives and liberals disagree so fundamentally on what a welfare program should be that many attempts to reform A.F.D.C. have failed for lack of consensus.
 
Welfare's Central Conflict
 Conservatives worry most about poor people's becoming dependent on welfare generation after generation and never bothering to fend for themselves. Liberals are most concerned that benefits are not high enough to enable the poor to live in dignity.
Almost everyone agrees that those who can work should work. But jobs in the inner cities are scarce, and a basic conflict has never been resolved: On one hand, if welfare benefits are withdrawn when poor people take jobs, then there is little incentive to work, because the difference between what they can earn and their welfare payments is small. On the other hand, if they are allowed to keep a good part of their welfare checks when they go to work, then they have considerably more income than people they are working with side by side who have never been on welfare.
One reason Federal aid to the elderly has been so universally accepted is that the aged are not expected to work, so the trade-off between work and benefits does not arise.
Like many other conservatives, Stuart M. Butler, director of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington research institute, believes that the Aid to Families program is so fraught with misguided incentives that it has poisoned almost all Government social programs.
 
Bright Spots
 "Walk around the inner cities if you dare to, and all you see are people on the street corners not expected to do anything," Mr. Butler said. "The men would be crazy to look after their families and the women would be foolish to take a job because the welfare benefits would run out."
But even most ardent conservatives concede that some Government programs have basically been successes, like Head Start for poor preschool children and the Job Corps, the residential work-training program for the most seriously disadvantaged youth.
And other scholars have found small but valuable programs around the country. One, in Chicago, has helped thousands of poor black families move from the inner cities to better lives in federally subsidized housing in the suburbs. Another, called Youth Build, now in eight cities, has poor young men learn construction skills by restoring buildings. These programs rely on at least some Federal money, but they are locally organized and might not be applicable nationwide.
Some Government programs have distinctly failed. No one today defends the high-rise public housing projects that were built in the 1950's.
 
When Good Yielded Bad
 Other programs had unintended adverse consequences. The urban renewal grants of the 1950's and 60's placed modern buildings in the downtowns of cities, but in the process neighborhoods were destroyed and families were displaced. In the end, much more housing was lost than gained.
And the interstate highway program, the most important public works project in American history, facilitated the abandonment of the cities.
Many people now live in better housing because of Federal aid like rent subsidies, but the money has always been so short that only a small portion of poor people could benefit. On balance, developers and landlords have probably been the real winners from Federal housing programs.
Employment training programs have also had mixed results. They have been especially beneficial for many women but have failed most young black men. Most of the jobs programs have been guilty of "creaming," giving training to the best-qualified applicants, who would probably have succeeded without the special training.
"The problems are just so intractable," said Tom Joe, director of the nonprofit Center for the Study of Social Policy in Washington. "I hate to say it, but the programs that work, the ones that really work, are those that get people out of the inner city."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: California;
CLINTON 'OBSESSED' WITH U.S. TROUBLES

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EL CAJON, Calif., May 9

 BODY:
Bill Clinton said today he wakes up every day obsessed with America's social and economic problems, and he suggested that President Bush had been so isolated that he took an interest in such problems only in an election year or after a crisis, like the riots in Los Angeles.
Mr. Clinton made the comments in an outdoor amphitheater in this suburb of San Diego as he began introducing himself to the voters of California, where he is not well known. California holds a Presidential primary on June 2. 
 Already focusing on the general election campaign, Mr. Clinton, the likely Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party, tried to underline differences between himself and Mr. Bush.
"You have got to understand, one big difference between me and Mr. Bush is the way we have lived for the last 11 years," said Mr. Clinton, the Governor of Arkansas. "I am not being critical of him, but he was Vice President and he was in the foreign policy establishment, the political party establishment of the Republican Party. I have been a Governor who has lived with people on a very personal basis. When people lose their jobs or their businesses or their farms, there is a good chance I'll know them by their names. I live in a small state."
 
Benefits of Prevention
 Mr. Clinton said: "The things I am talking about today are things that I will keep on the front burner as long as I am President because they are the things that drive me. I get up every morning obsessed with this stuff. You need a President now who basically will put the needs and interests of the American people first every day all the time. That's what we need right now."
Mr. Clinton was asked how he would sustain the nation's interest in race relations and the problems of America's cities, after people stopped focusing on the riots in South-Central Los Angeles.
"I hope to be able to persuade people who live in some states where there are no minorities that they should be very interested in the economic vitality of Los Angeles and New York because we all pay," Mr. Clinton said.
For example, he said, the cost of education and job training is much lower than the cost of imprisoning someone who turns to a life of crime rather than productive employment, and the cost of prenatal care for a pregnant woman is much lower than the cost of intensive care in a hospital for a baby born prematurely with birth defects.
 
Affirms 'Pro-Choice' Stance
 Mr. Clinton's message appeared to be well received. The applause was loud when he affirmed his support for a woman's right to choose abortion. "I am pro-choice," Mr. Clinton said. "But pro-choice is not the same thing as being pro-abortion." He said he favored sex education and other school programs to help reduce the number of pregnancies among teen-agers.
Mr. Clinton made an informal presentation of his political platform and then sat on a stool, fielding questions from the audience for about 40 minutes.
David Dickason, a 40-year-old research psychologist in the audience, said of Mr. Clinton: "I really like his style of campaigning. I like what he had to say. He is much more personable than I expected."
Carolyn Anderson, another listener, also praised Mr. Clinton. She said that Mr. Clinton, unlike Mr. Bush, "has lived like a majority of Americans have lived."
 
Noting 'Poor White Folks'
 Mr. Clinton asserted that Bush Administration officials were trying to use welfare as a political issue to divide Americans along racial lines. But the Governor said: "We should not pretend that welfare is a racial issue. There are more poor white folks in this country than poor non-white folk."
Mr. Clinton acknowledged today that he was not well known in California and that his position in the primary election campaign was therefore difficult. But he said: "I think it will get better and better. I have no presence out here. I am just beginning to establish it."

HEADLINE: Iran's Leader Gets Support in a Runoff

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, May 9

 BODY:
Results of parliamentary runoff elections held on Friday confirm that President Hashemi Rafsanjani will have enough support to counter political rivals and carry out his policies of an opening to the West and liberalizing Iran's economy.
Supporters of Mr. Rafsanjani repeated their success in the first round of voting with a landslide victory in Teheran and a comfortable majority across the country. 
 With 75 percent of the vote counted, more than half the winners are candidates who have pledged support for the Society of Combatant Clergymen, a group that backs Mr. Rafsanjani, according to the Risalat newspaper. Nearly half the seats in the 270-seat Parliament were undecided after the first round of voting.
Although the final results in Teheran will not be announced until Sunday, partial returns indicated that all 30 Parliament seats in the capital will go to candidates who ran on the ticket of Spiritualist Combatants.
 
Former Minister Wins
 One of the leading vote getters in Teheran was Mohammad Javad Larijani, a foreign policy strategist in the Government and former Deputy Foreign Minister. Mr. Larijani last year called for safeguarding "common U.S.-Iranian interests in the Persian Gulf" which he said "could precede" the normalization of relations between Teheran and Washington.
Another winner in Teheran was Maryam Behroozi, who will be serving her fourth term in the Parliament as a member of Mr. Rafsanjani's party. She ran on a platform of improving the status of women in Iranian society.
In a recent interview with foreign journalists, Moussavi Khoeiniha, a hard-line candidate and editor of the Salam newspaper, voiced displeasure with the success of Mr. Rafsanjani's supporters in the first round of elections. About 80 pro-Rafsanjani candidates won in the first round compared with only about 20 hard-line fundamentalists. Other winners were independents whose political affiliations were not clear.
With a large majority of candidates running as independents, in early April Risalat published a list of 120 names of "candidates who pledge support for President Hashemi." The list was cited later as support for the contention that the majority of first-round winners supported Mr. Rafsanjani's policies.
Risalat editors indicated this morning that more than half of those elected so far in the runoffs backed Mr. Rafsanjani's party.
 
Backing for President
 "We have to show our support for the President," said Ihsan Kavian, a Western-educated businessman who voted in both elections. "Rafsanjani wants to change the image of Iran. It is vital that we vote for those who work to rebuild the country and return Iran to the international community."
Pocketbook issues of unemployment and inflation were paramount. People interviewed on state-run Iranian television generally expressed dissatisfaction with "candidates who bicker more than they work," in the words of one. Many Iranians see the hard-line majority as having slowed economic reform by their opposition to Mr. Rafsanjani's free-market economic policies.
And in a national trend of turning away from career politicians, voters overwhelmingly registered their support for technocrats or specialists in different fields who are new to the Parliament -- more than half the first-round winners.
Mr. Rafsanjani is reportedly considering major changes in his Cabinet by the end of the year, according to a recent editorial in the Teheran Times, which is close to the Rafsanjani camp.
The moves, Western diplomats say, would be intended to complete a cycle of changing the old guard. After a significant victory by his supporters in the Parliament, he would replace influential ministers from the early days of the Iran-Iraq war who are considered as not having moved fast enough with reform, with a group of technocrat "experts." A new political elite in the Parliament and the Administration, diplomats say, could help Iran attract more investment and loans.

HEADLINE: South Korea's Vietnam Veterans Begin to Be Heard

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
The tales of chaotic battles in Vietnamese jungles are much the same as those heard in the United States. The anger at a government that some say used its young men as pawns in a cold war power game is also familiar. But the faces of these bitter Vietnam veterans are different: They are Korean, and after years of bearing their hurt in near silence, they are finally being recognized for their role in a war few know South Korea fought.
It is almost as little known here as it is in the West, but South Korea sent 312,853 solders to Vietnam from Sept. 22, 1963, to April 30, 1975, according to the Defense Ministry. After the United States, South Korea had the largest contingent of soldiers fighting Hanoi. 
 But with two big-budget movies on the Korean soldiers in Vietnam coming out here shortly and the Vietnam Veterans Association battling for better treatment for its members, South Koreans are starting to come to grips with their heavy involvement in Vietnam and the toll the war took on many of the young men who served there.
The veterans' stories are opening a little-explored chapter in South Korea's history, and are becoming a symbol of how this scarred country may finally be winning its own battle for free expression after years of authoritarian rule. The rough-and-tumble process of democracy, just five years old, is slowly giving South Koreans the chance to explore the difficult path they have taken to their current prosperity.
 
Like Others, Alienated
 "The Vietnam veterans in other countries who returned were very alienated," said Hwang Myung Chul, vice president of the Vietnam Veteran's Association, seated near the neat rows of jars filled with black and dun-colored Vietnamese earth that he hopes one day to place in an official memorial. "We were no exception. We wanted the media to relate our pain and difficulties, but they were told not to. The Government virtually ignored our problems. That is what we are fighting now."
For some, there is pride that South Korea, which was saved from Communist domination only because of United States military intervention in 1950, answered America's call for help. Soldiers from Thailand, the Philippines, Canada, Australia and New Zealand also served in Vietnam.
But South Korea's Government had a number of reasons for responding so energetically to America's call for assistance in Vietnam. The military-dominated Government in power at that time had to maintain a constant vigil against attack from Communist North Korea, bolstered by American troops stationed in South Korea, and was resisting pressure from its own people for the introduction of real democracy at home. It also was engaged in a struggle to free the country from its grinding poverty -- tasks that all required some aid or acquiescence from the United States.
Many South Koreans argue that their Government acted more out of a desire for the hundreds of millions of dollars in aid the United States offered, or that they feel shame because Koreans were killing and being killed in a land in which they had no place. Some complain, too, that the Government has still not told the whole story of South Korea's role in the war helping the United States support South Vietnam's fight against the Communist North.
 
4,687 Koreans Reported Killed
 According to the Defense Ministry, 4,687 Koreans were killed in the war, and more than 5,000 others wounded, but some veterans insist that the casualty figure is much higher, based on the death tolls in their own units. Also unexplored are reports of the particularly brutal methods the Korean soldiers were said to have used.
For the veterans, much of the focus now is on demands for greater Government assistance, which they say has been in meager. One particular complaint is that the Government neither recognizes nor offers treatment for problems related to Agent Orange, the powerful chemical used to kill dense jungle foliage during the war. The chemical is believed to have caused an array of health problems for some of the soldiers exposed to it.
Studies in the West have been unable to turn up clear evidence of ill effects, except for a temporary skin condition, called chloracne, and small increases in rates of a kind of cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma. As a result, even American veterans have been fighting with their Veteran Affairs Department, which limits the claims that it will pay. American veterans groups, like their Korean counterparts, continue to protest this policy.
American veterans, along with some Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders, are eligible, however, for compensation from the manufacturers of Agent Orange. Korean soldiers were not part of a 1984 court decision establishing the fund to make these payments. And the Korean Government says it will not assist them in efforts to qualify for the compensation.
Kim Young O, a director of the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, said the Government had no programs to treat veterans claiming problems from exposure to Agent Orange because no illnesses have been detected.
 
Economic Benefits From War
 The war provided tremendous economic benefits for South Korea, but it was a political inconvenience. In the 1960's, South Korea had barely recovered from war and was still one of the poorest nations in Asia.
The Vietnam War provided what were by Korean standards generous salaries for soldiers. The Government also received huge amounts of aid, which helped catapult South Korea into its status as a newly industrialized country.
But politically South Korea was not ready to permit open debate on a war said to represent a battle between freedom and Communism, particularly when South Koreans were struggling for freedom against their unelected, military-dominated Government.
That, of course, has now changed. The first open presidential election was held five years ago, and in elections for the National Assembly last month the voters denied the governing party a majority.
 
Two Movies to Cost Millions
 The two multimillion-dollar Vietnam movies, one being made for the cinema and the other to be serialized on television, along with several new books depict a grim, dispiriting war.
One of the new movies, "White Badge," is based on a novel whose serialization in a magazine in 1983 caused the publication to be closed.
"Members of the younger generation do not even know that Koreans served in Vietnam," said Ahn Jungyo, a veteran and the author of the book, which depicts the horrors suffered by one group of soldiers. "Nobody talked about it. What the Government has done is a kind of mass cheating of the people."
"White Badge" will cost $2.6 million, a high figure for the Korean movie industry, and was filmed partly in Vietnam. The film being made for television, whose preliminary title is "Farewell to Songba River," also cost $2.6 million. This movie is described as a look at the relationship between two young soldiers as they come of age.
One of the soldiers in "White Badge" ponders: "The blood money we had to earn at the price of our lives fueled the modernization and development of the country. And owing to our contribution, the Republic of Korea, or at least a higher echelon of it, made a gigantic stride into the world market. Lives for sale. National mercenaries."

HEADLINE: The New Struggle for Afghanistan: On All Sides, Nations Seek Influence

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 9

 BODY:
Less than 24 hours after Islamic rebels took control of Kabul two weeks ago, Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, hurriedto the Afghan capital to express his support for the new Government.
But he went also to remind the country's new rulers of who had provided the bulk of support in their war against the Soviet Army and the Government it had backed, a broad hint that Pakistan intended to wield a heavy hand. 
 On Mr. Sharif's heels were a succession of Iranian and Saudi officials, a smattering of Sudanese, and, more quietly, representatives from the new republics of Central Asia. Even United Nations officials, whose peace plan evaporated in the face of guerrilla guns, still scurry around the capital.
The last of the cold war's battlegrounds, Afghanistan has become a new arena for regional competition, no longer between the superpowers, but among its neighbors, its new Islamic allies and the wary republics to the north. Exhausted by 14 years of war, impoverished, illiterate, littered with mines and bereft of anything resembling a functioning economy, Afghanistan has nonetheless become a choice morsel hungered after by everyone in the area.
 
No Role for the U.S.
 Some countries view it as an important economic crossroads and some as a testing ground of Islamic orthodoxy. Still others would like to head off the threat to regional stability they believe it poses.
Conspicuously absent from the fray are the United States, which gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the Islamic guerrilla armies to fight Soviet troops, and Russia, to the extent it is the most prominent successor of the Soviet Union.
Virtually all of the money from Washington -- the exact amount has yet to be disclosed -- was funneled by Pakistan to the most militant, fundamentalist parties, particularly the Hezb-i-Islami, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The seeming victors in Kabul, a confusing and uncertain coalition of northern guerrillas, western Shiites, southern fundamentalists and relative moderates, are well aware of the main beneficiary of American largesse: they are now confronting Mr. Hekmatyar's army along the southern flank of Kabul.
"The U.S. was led by the nose by Pakistan," said a senior Western diplomat in the Afghan capital last week. "Now they're out of the game."
The United States Embassy was closed in 1989 after Soviet troops withdrew from the country and there are no American diplomats in Kabul.
 
U.N. on the Sidelines
 The United Nations, whose special representative, Benon Sevan, invested four years searching for peace, was also marginalized by the sudden guerrilla occupation of Kabul. Mr. Sevan's main job now seems to be protecting former President Najibullah, who has taken sanctuary in the United Nations offices. Mr. Sevan has visited Kabul since the occupation, but appears to have found nothing to do.
Pakistan, whose interests intertwine most directly with Afghanistan's, is not without its own problems in Kabul. Just as memories of American policies are vivid there, so are they acute about Islamabad's favorite for more than a decade.
"You don't think Sharif's trip was a courtesy call," the Western diplomat commented. "He had to repair his bridges and stake his claim, not an easy job for him at this point."
Pakistan's problems with Kabul are aggravated not only by its past favoritism, but also by early signs that tensions on Pakistan's own political stage are soon to be played out in Afghanistan.
 
Arms Shipments Halted
 In January, Pakistan announced that it was halting all arms shipments to the Afghan guerrillas fighting the Government of Mr. Najibullah, a decision that was denounced by the arch-fundamentalist politician Qazi Hussain Ahmed. Two weeks ago, Mr. Hussain pulled his party out of Mr. Sharif's governing coalition, declaring that the Government was not moving fast enough in making Pakistan a pure Islamic society.
Although the party holds only a handful of seats in the National Assembly, its defection set the stage for a confrontation between Pakistan's well-organized fundamentalist political forces and the more secular elite.
Mr. Hussain, in conservative religious garb complete with a white head veil he rarely wears in Pakistan, appeared in Kabul last week declaring that he was ready to give guidance to the new Government on the introduction of Islamic laws. Well known for his fervent support of Mr. Hekmatyar, who embraces a similarly rigorous orthodox Islam, Mr. Hussain seemed to be trying to scuttle the advances of Mr. Sharif, and conceivably advance the fortunes of Mr. Hekmatyar.
For their part, the Pakistani Prime Minister and senior officials in his Government have said they hope Afghanistan will be the linchpin of regional economic stability. They see it as the major transit point for goods moving between the Central Asian republics and the port at Karachi. Without a unified, secure Afghanistan, those dreams will probably remain unfulfilled.
Pakistan is also burdened with more than three million Afghan refugees. Many of them have lived in border camps and villages for more than a decade and have children who were born there and are eligible for Pakistani citizenship. While the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has a well-organized program to repatriate these refugees, many have no homes to return to, their abandoned land having been either mined or appropriated, and no source of income.
Only the end of factional fighting in Afghanistan will enable Pakistan to unburden itself of the refugees.
 
New Republics Are Wary
 In the Central Asian republics to the north, where the echoes of Communist governance still resonate, the possibility of a fundamentalist neighbor is perceived with alarm in some quarters. And the ascension of Muslim forces in Tajikistan this week suggests that Islamic thought is spreading.
Diplomats at the Russian Embassy in Kabul, who have sometimes represented the interests of these republics, particularly Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, are apprehensive. For the administrations of some of these republics, religious fundamentalism remains an anathema. Indeed, in countries like Uzbekistan, religious political parties are outlawed.
On the west, Iran is also burdened by Afghan refugees, estimated at two and a half million to three million. But more important, Iran sees its mission as defending the rights of Afghanistan's minority Shiite population. No census has ever been successfully done in Afghanistan, but many authorities on the country suggest that Shiites may constitute between 25 and 30 percent of the population.
During the 14-year war, Iran armed and supported Shiite guerrilla groups, many of whom were of the ethnic Hazara minority. In Herat, Afghanistan's westernmost city, Iranian influence is considerable, with Iranian clerics and intelligence agents a common sight on the city's streets. Iran sees western Afghanistan as a natural thoroughfare to the Central Asian republics, which it considers fertile ground for spreading the faith.
The Saudis, too, have been active, pouring huge amounts of money into hard-line Sunni Muslim groups in the last year. And while the Sudanese have little or no money to dispense, they have also been trying to spread the religion.
 
Afghans Are Divided
 Thwarting all attempts to influence Kabul is the factionalism within the ruling coalition and the ethnic divides that threaten to fragment the country permanently. During the war, the welter of Islamic guerrilla groups spent as much time battling one another as they did the enemy in Kabul.
Virtually all of Afghanistan's cities are run by independent councils, alliances of local commanders, religious leaders and high-ranking former Government officials. In Jalalabad, for example, the city is run by a 22-member shura, or council, representing the seven rebel parties that were based in Peshawar and led by Abdul Qadir, the brother of Abdul Haq, a prominent rebel commander in Kabul.
Nonetheless, the shura in Jalalabad has thrived without guidance from Kabul, although Mr. Haq says it has sent a delegation to meet with the interim Government in the hope of gaining military representation on the governing council.
Other cities around Afghanistan, like Kandahar in the southeast and Herat in the west, which are also run by shuras, are also functioning effectively in isolation from the Afghan capital. While they too have sent delegations to Kabul, it is clear that they are not receiving directions from the capital.
In Kabul itself, guerrilla forces wrangle over sharing power, the extent to which Islamic principles should govern Afghan society and how to deal with Mr. Hekmatyar, who lurks outside the capital with thousands of heavily armed troops.
Divided by soaring mountain ranges, linguistic barriers and separate ethnic identities, Afghanistan has little to bind it. Kabul's weakness as a center of authority, combined with the often divisive tactics of the country's neighbors, offers little hope that genuine unity, or real peace, is within sight.

HEADLINE: More Sanctions May Be the Way To Push Libya, Mideast Aides Say

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, May 9

 BODY:
Western diplomats and Arab officials now say that additional sanctions may be the only way to force Libya to accede to United Nations demands to hand over two suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet.
Western diplomats say the new sanctions under consideration include an embargo on Libyan oil, the mainstay of the country's economy. But Arab nations are reluctant to impose an oil embargo. 
 The assessment comes less than a month after the Security Council on April 15 imposed a cutoff of international air traffic to and from Libya, a reduction in Libya's diplomatic staff abroad and a ban on the sale of military equipment to Libya.
"We need a new kind of initiative, or initiatives, that will help move the situation," said Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt, who wants to give the Libyans more time but said Tripoli had spurned Egyptian suggestions on ways to end the standoff.
 
Unsuccessful Arab Efforts
 "The Libyans do not yet realize the full seriousness of their situation," a high-ranking Western diplomat said. "They are not responding to it in a cohesive or coherent manner. The very least you can say is that a solution is still some way off. There may have to be consultations regarding the possibility of additional sanctions or additional action."
The existing sanctions were imposed after Libya refused to turn over two men believed to have been involved in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
The Libyans have also been asked to assist in the investigation of the bombing of a French U.T.A. plane over Niger in 1989 that killed 171 people and have been told to end support for terrorist organizations.
The decision by Arab countries to honor the sanctions has been accompanied by visits and appeals by Arab officials to persuade the Libyans to turn the two men over to Britain or the United States. Those efforts have been unsuccessful, as have three meetings of the Arab League to discuss a solution.
 
Feeling of Deadlock
 President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, whose Government has close ties to the United States, has worked hard in the last two years to establish a relationship with the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The two countries clashed briefly in a border dispute in 1977 and did not resume normal diplomatic relations until 1989.
President Mubarak, who tried to slow the process toward sanctions and opposes military strikes against Libya, is widely considered to be the Arab leader with the most leverage to forge a solution to the impasse.
But despite rounds of meetings, including one between President Mubarak and Colonel Qaddafi on April 21, and frequent conversations between the two Ggovernments, Egyptian officials concede they have made little headway.
"There is a certain feeling that we might have reached a deadlock," said Mr. Moussa. "But this feeling is not definitive."

HEADLINE: More and More Look to a Post-Castro Cuba

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 9

 BODY:
The business consultant captured the mood of mounting anticipation here over Cuba.
"I know they are going to be selling their telephone company soon, and I have a client who is interested in buying," the animated businessman said between sessions of a two-day Florida Bar Association seminar called "Post-Castro Cuba." 
 With Cuba's economy sagging badly from the abrupt curtailment of all of its aid and most of its trade with the former Soviet Union, remarks like these have become commonplace at the now almost weekly gatherings of academics and potential investors around the country to discuss what many have begun calling the endgame for the Communist Government of President Fidel Castro.
But while many in this country eagerly hope for new economic opportunities in Cuba, both Havana and Washington continue to pursue policies that have kept relations in a deep freeze for over three decades.
In its recent efforts to stave off economic collapse and stem popular discontent, Mr. Castro's Government has recently moved to open the economy to private investment from abroad, and has introduced changes that academics say could mildly dilute the pervading control of the Communist Party.
The moves come on the heels of Cuba's withdrawal from Angola and disengagement from political and military struggles in Central America that were once cited as the principal irritants preventing more normal relations with Washington.
Along with its recent reform efforts, however, Havana has unleashed a harsh crackdown on dissenters, sternly lectured Cuban journalists that the Government is the sole repository of the truth and denounced as "garbage" multiparty electoral democracy, without which the United States now says there will be no normalization.
Republican and Democratic politicians in the United States are staking out tough positions on Cuba in this Presidential election year, at least in part as a political-season nod to conservative anti-Castro Cuban-Americans.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, has sponsored legislation that would punish American subsidiaries for trade with Cuba, ban ships that dock in Cuban harbors from the United States, and prohibit foreign assistance to countries that give aid or practice subsidized trade with Cuba. Trade between domestically based companies and Cuba has been banned, along with most other exchanges with the island, by a 30-year-old embargo.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic presidential candidate, recently endorsed the Torricelli bill during a campaign swing through south Florida. Not to be outdone in pleasing a constituency that in the past has voted heavily Republican, the Bush Administration has recently signaled its support for most of the bill, after ironing out portions that officials had warned would create serious frictions with major United States trading partners.
Havana has responded by denouncing the moves as the equivalent of war, and has turned up its anti-American propaganda several notches, focusing on the recent riots in Los Angeles as evidence of America's moral bankruptcy.
Asked if there were any prospect of a relaxation of American policies toward Cuba, Robert F. Gelbard, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America, answered with a concise "no." Referring to Mr. Castro's human rights record and statements about electoral democracy, he added "the question is, what do you open up to."
Several experts in Cuban affairs who met late last month at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington said they now expect little change in American policies toward Cuba until Mr. Castro dies or is somehow unseated.
"I view it as very similar to the Likud Party's attitude toward Arafat," said Mitchell A. Seligson, director of Latin American Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, using a Middle Eastern analogy to explain official American attitudes toward Mr. Castro. "Arafat simply has to go. There is no way people are going to start saying let's deal with our historical enemy."

HEADLINE: AMERICAN EXPORTS TO POOR COUNTRIES ARE RAPIDLY RISING

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., May 9

 BODY:
The American economy, badly in need of bright spots, is gaining strength from an unlikely source: the third world, where purchases of American goods rose 15 percent last year.
Nonindustrialized nations have increased their purchases from American businesses and farmers to $146.79 billion last year. And this year they are expected to buy even more. The United States still runs a large, but shrinking, trade deficit with these nations through purchases of fruit and vegetables, steel and oil. 
 The United States is also increasing its share of these countries' expanding imports at the expense of other industrialized nations. In effect the United States is claiming a growing slice of a growing pie.
American exports to wealthy countries remain enormous -- $70 billion last year just to Japan and Britain -- but as those economies have slowed, the growth rate of American exports has dribbled down to a very small percentage.
 
Important U.S. Customers
 During the first two months of this year, nonindustrialized countries bought 35.6 percent of American exports, the highest rate since 1982. The nonindustrial countries are mainly those in Latin America, Africa (except for South Africa), the Middle East and Asia (except for China, Japan and some former Soviet republics). Most of the exports go to middle-income countries like Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Malaysia and South Korea.
As dozens of top corporate executives met here on Friday and Saturday, one of the strongest themes was the rise in business prospects overseas from Santiago, Chile, to Alma Ata, Kazakhstan. "It differs from industry to industry but I sense among my colleagues here a growing confidence about the calcuated risks and opportunities in nontraditional export markets," said Robert E. Allen, the chairman and chief executive of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
 
Economists Explain Trend
 Economists offer a variety of traditional explanations for the gains: American manufacturing productivity is on the rise while wage increases have been modest, the dollar has fallen precipitously since 1985 and developing economies in Latin America and Southeast Asia are prospering as they sell state-owned businesses to private investors.
But three other reasons help explain the American success. One is that the United States, while a weak competitor in consumer goods, remains the leading producer of goods used to build nations, like telephone company switches, trucks, commercial aircraft and personal computers. Another is that while large American companies increasingly use factories in Europe and Japan to serve markets there, they have fewer factories in nonindustrialized countries and export to them from the United States. A third is that large markets, including Brazil and India, have been removing trade barriers, like Brazil's outright ban on many car and computer imports.
According to figures compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group of 24 industrialized nations, the American share of sales to poor countries by industrial nations climbed to 29.6 percent in the first nine months of last year from 27.3 percent in all of 1990.
The role of exports to developing countries in American trade last peaked in the late 1970's, when high oil prices and huge commercial bank loans to third world governments created an investment boom. But in the early 1980's falling oil prices and high interest rates crippled many debt-ridden developing countries, and their ability to buy American goods crumbled. But now new economic policies and lower interest rates have once again revived many of these countries, and their imports are increasing, too.
American companies large and small have benefited.
A.T.& T.'s sales of central office switches and other telephone gear tripled in Latin America last year, to $80 million, and are projected to double this year, the company says. And in Clive, Iowa, the tiny Hettinga Equipment Inc. expects its sales of plastic molding equipment in Malaysia, Thailand and elsewhere in Asia to triple this year.
 
Sales in India and Russia
 Jeanine S. Hettinga, the president and chief executive of the 51-employee company, said she was also beginning to sell to Russia and India. Demand is especially strong in these newly opening economies for molding equipment, which is used to make automobile dashboards, vinyl car door panels, toilet seats and plastic cupboard doors.
The European Community's move this year to drop internal trade barriers "is a very protectionist move, and Japan has never been easy," said Mrs. Hettinga. "We have to look for more open markets."
The gain in trade with developing nations is also helping the recent economic recovery in the United States, and, therefore, is important to President Bush's re-election chances.
The Commerce Department estimates that the increase in third-world exports was directly or indirectly responsible for up to 400,000 jobs, and that without the extra demand from developing countries, the nation's economy would have shrunk 1.1 percent last year instead of just seven-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Effect on Trade Policy
 The rising exports are also strongly affecting American trade policy. One reason the United States is negotiating a free-trade agreement with Mexico and considering similar negotiations with Chile is that American exports to Mexico have almost tripled since 1986 while sales to Chile have nearly doubled since 1988. The trade agreements, the Administration says, will broaden the current free-market policies in in these countries and make it harder for future governments there to change them.
To be sure, American trade relations with the developing countries still have problems. The United States ran a $28.23 billion trade deficit with them last year, although this was half the 1990 deficit. With the slowdown of the British and Japanese economies -- which together cut their imports from the United States by 2.6 percent last year, while increasing them slightly early this year -- even the Commerce Department predicts that the nation's overall trade deficit may widen slightly this year.
 
Bankers Are Wary
 Burned during the 1980's by Latin American debts, most commercial banks remain reluctant to lend to exporters on the basis of payments expected from foreign companies. This has made it difficult for companies to finance their trade, and while the problem may now be easing, it remains a subject of concern at the White House.
The growing exports have come although many American companies made only weak efforts to sell goods abroad.
Fred Zeder, the head of the Federal agency that insures American investments overseas, complained at a Cabinet-level meeting in the White House on April 22 that earlier on the same morning he had canceled a trade and investment mission to Indonesia and Singapore for lack of interest among corporate executives. "I had, after six months of work, only three people willing to go there," he said.
Yet American companies that looked east and west for new markets two or three years ago are now looking south in particular, said David Rockefeller, a former chairman and chief executive of Chase Manhattan Bank. "People are seeing that Latin America is probably the part of the world with the greatest potential for exports right now," he said.
 
Gains in South America
 American exports climbed 17.7 percent to Mexico last year and 19.6 percent to South America, but sales to other regions also surged. Exports to southeast Asia climbed 12.1 percent and shipments to the Soviet Union rose 15.9 percent.
The trend has surprised even some top policy makers. Brazil's Economics Minister, Marcilio Marques Moreira pointed out in a lunch discussion on April 28 that the United States's share of Brazil's imports had jumped to 24 percent last year from 20 percent in 1990, even though overall demand for imports there was stagnant.
"I really do not know exactly the reasons why," Mr. Moreira admitted.
A new study by Andrew M. Warner, an economist at the Federal Reserve, found that the level of investment spending worldwide determines the level of American exports more than the value of the dollar. The enormous widening of the United States trade deficit in the mid-1980's reflected not only the rise of the dollar but also weakness in investment abroad, especially in developing countries with large foreign debts.
 
Products People Don't See
 This trade deficit is most visible in any consumer electronics store or toy store. Most of the televisions or stuffed animals seem to be made in Korea or Taiwan or Hong Kong. Yet the United States remains very competitive internationally in products that many Americans seldom see.
"Developing countries traditionally have a greater need for capital goods and the United States is good at" making them, said Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative.
At the same time, American companies still tend to supply third world markets from the United States. When Corning Inc. finds increasing demand for its tableware or fiber optic cables in Europe or Japan, it steps up production at its factories in those places, said Richard Dulude, a vice chairman of the company. But Corning has very few factories in the nonindustrialized world, so that extra shipments to them are coming from places like Corning, N.Y., or Wilmington, N.C.
"We don't have the manufacturing bases in the developing countries that we do have in developed countries," Mr. Dulude said.
The combination of all these factors has produced a small glow of outright prosperity in an otherwise slowmoving economy. "Exports are the silver lining of this recession, and within exports, it's capital goods to less developed countries," Mr. Warner said.

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The events in Los Angeles have had one quite unexpected result. They have made millions of Americans see their President as a man curiously unconnected to realities of life in the country they share with him.
Mr. Bush muttered "unbelievable, unbelievable" as he toured Los Angeles last week. He saw desperate people, black and white and Asian -- people without jobs, without the simplest level of security, without hope. And he was evidently shocked by his discovery of that America. 
 But there are scenes of desolation and desperation all over this country, and it took no riots or fires to produce them. The next time Mr. Bush flies to New York he could drive from La Guardia Airport across the Triborough Bridge and straight through the desolate streets of Harlem.
Our cities are sick, their people numbed by poverty and crime, their public facilities degraded, their governments unable to keep up with even the need for such necessities as medical care and education. Open your eyes, and you see neglect.
Race is not the main problem, bad as it is. There are crumbling centers of cities and rural towns where there is no element of racial tension. The highest concentration of homeless people, per capita, is in New York's affluent Westchester County.
No, the problem is economics. The manufacturing that once provided jobs for Queens and South-Central Los Angeles and Peoria is vanishing. The men and women who did well-paid work in steel mills and auto plants are lucky to get half as much at a McDonald's. Fewer jobs have been created during the Bush years than in any administration for decades.
And it is as if George Bush were unaware of those realities. He flew around the country to business meetings and $10,000-a-table political dinners, insulated from the struggle for existence. He had a one-item economic program: reduce capital gains taxes.
Similarly, Mr. Bush has acted until now as if he had no idea -- none at all -- of the ugly realities that black Americans face in their lives.
The Boston Globe ran a piece last week on how some distinguished black men had been hassled by the police: among them a law professor, a television producer and Mr. Bush's own Associate Attorney General, Wayne Budd. Every black person in the country is aware of such experiences.
But George Bush knew nothing of that. Nor did he see anything wrong with playing the racial card in politics -- with arousing white fears by talk of Willie Horton and "quotas."
When the Simi Valley jury acquitted the Los Angeles policemen who brutalized Rodney King, President Bush was unable to come up with a meaningful response.
First he said, "The court system has worked, and what's needed now is calm and respect for the law until the appeals process takes place." Of course there is no appeal from an acquittal.
Then he talked about law and order, ignoring the hurt felt by blacks and many whites from that verdict. Next his press secretary tried to blame the riots on 25-year-old Democratic programs. Finally, in Los Angeles, Mr. Bush said, "We are embarrassed by interracial violence and prejudice."
The question is how George Bush can be so remote from the realities of his country. He is an intelligent man; no one can doubt that. The criticism of him as a "patrician" is silly; Franklin Roosevelt, more patrician, connected emotionally to ordinary Americans and their problems.
Perhaps Mr. Bush just reflects what has happened to our democracy. It is mostly the comfortable who vote and have political influence nowadays. Perhaps he exists only in that political cocoon. Or might he, at last, open his mind and heart?
The danger in not hearing, not seeing, is that more and more Americans will feel outside the system -- outside their country. James Jones, an unemployed black 18-year-old in Los Angeles, said as Mr. Bush toured there: "I've got nothing to say to him. Ain't nothing going to happen. I'm just going to live my little life."
A Korean-American woman in Los Angeles pleaded with Mr. Bush to listen as people were "reaching out to you to tell you what we are going through. . . . Please, please, please, these are lives, these are human beings."

HEADLINE: Stingley, in Cap and Gown, Hears Cheers Again

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAFAYETTE, Ind., May 9

 BODY:
The brightness of his future in the National Football League blinded Darryl Stingley to a life beyond football.
After the New England Patriots drafted him in 1973, Stingley left Purdue University 24 credit hours short of a college degree, a standout receiver with all the hope and promise that is bestowed upon those fortunate enough to be a first-round draft pick. 
 But in one of football's most frightening moments, Stingley's N.F.L. career went dark after a vicious hit by Oakland Raiders safety Jack Tatum during an exhibition game in 1978. The blow left Stingley paralyzed from the neck down.
Stingley, 43 years old, returned to the Purdue campus today for the first time since 1973 to receive his bachelor of physical education degree, seeing things through different eyes and perhaps more clearly than he did when he left nearly two decades ago.
 
Man on a Mission
 "I'm guess I'm proof that it's never to late to finish your education and get your degree," Stingley said. "So many people look at black athletes and say that they're just going to college to play sports. But that's not the case all the time. I want to prove those people wrong."
Stingley, who uses a motorized wheelchair, sat on the stage of the Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music, in cap and gown, with his mother, Hilda Stingley, during the graduation ceremony this morning.
He was the last student to receive his degree and the moment brought a standing ovation from the more than 1,000 other graduates, most of whom were toddlers when Stingley was last on campus.
By receiving his degree, Stingley fulfilled a promise he made to his parents when he left their home in Chicago for Purdue in 1969. His father, Harold, never finished high school and was a semipro football player and laborer most of his life before he died in 1989; his mother, who has worked at Whitney Young High School in Chicago for 30 years, instilled in him a strong work ethic and the importance of an education.
"It was a given in my family that you would get an education," Stingley said. "I was the youngest of four children. My two brothers and my sister had all gone to school and gotten their degrees and I was the youngest one. I was expected to do the same thing. I'm bringing up the rear."
Because he uses a wheelchair, Stingley decided to take correspondence courses through a program set up by Citywide College of Chicago. He took business courses conducted by cable television, following lesson plans provided by Citywide.
Purdue accepted the course work and applied it toward Stingley's degree. It took him two years to complete the work.
Now, Stingley can exhort the two youngest of his three sons -- John, 22, who attends Chicago State University, and Derek, 21, who spent a year a Purdue and is enrolled at Kishawaukee Community College in DeKalb, Ill. -- to obtain their degrees.
Stingley said he did not know what he will do with his degree, perhaps coach or teach. But it has given him options.
"Education in some form or fashion allows you to empower yourself through knowledge," he said. "You don't have to go to a four-year college, but even if you develop some type of skill you help your economic future without waiting for someone to hand you something."
Getting a degree at this point was not a step toward economic empowerment for Stingley, who has a comfortable existence in a lakeshore condominium in Chicago, away from the gnawing poverty and crime of the Lawndale area on the West Side of the city, where he was raised.
But the degree gives him power of a different sort. It adds heft to his messages about education and perserverance. And now that he has accomplished this goal, he can pursue others.
 
Thoughts About Youth
 "As I ride through some of the neighborhoods in Chicago, I see that the kids don't have the same type of places to go that I had as a kid," Stingley said. "I went to the Y.M.C.A. when I was growing up. I'd like to start a place like that where a kid can develop his spiritual and mental side as well as the physical."
Stingley said that it wasn't until the fall of 1990 that he was healthy and stable enough "to redirect some of my goals and make a commitment to go back to school."
Stingley contacted his former coach, Bob DeMoss, now an assistant athletics director at Purdue, and Pete Miller, an administrator in the physical education department, to determine what it would take for him to finish work on his degree.
"It was very nice to hear that he wanted to come back and finish," DeMoss said. "But that's the type of person Darryl is. He's a competitor and very dedicated. And this is something that he really wanted to do."
DeMoss and Miller went over Stingley's transcript and discovered that he needed 24 hours of electives to earn his degree.
Stingley reiterated that he isn't bitter toward Tatum, even though Tatum has never contacted Stingley or apologized for the debilitating hit.
"I don't harbor any ill feelings toward him," Stingley said. "What good would it do me? I had to get on with my life. In my heart I forgave Jack Tatum a long time ago. But I will never understand why a man would deliberately try to maim another man and take him away from his family."
 
Patriots' Standing Offer
 Even though the Patriots list Stingley as a scout and he has a standing offer to work for the team, he said he had not worked in that capacity in quite some time. Mainly, he has been an advocate for the disabled, working to make buildings accessible to the handicap.
And, yes, Stingley said he was still working toward getting out of the wheelchair.
"Sometimes I feel like this chair is just a temporary pit stop on my way to doing some other things," he said. "All through my life God has given me strength and courage to take on some things, made me fight when I felt like giving up, and He's given me a great deal of hope. He's blessed me with an indomitable spirit. And if you have that, anything can be done."

HEADLINE: Rubble, Rubble, Toil and Yet More Trouble

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
When the backhoes and jackhammers began to rip up Daphne Mahoney's East 14th Street block two years ago, she thought it was for the best.
After all, the workers would be replacing aging water mains and cracked sidewalks. There would be new trees, lampposts and street signs. No mere run-of-the-mill street reconstruction, this was to be the burnishing of an entire business district, she was told. 
 It sounded like a good idea.
Today, Ms. Mahoney's restaurant, Daphne's Hibiscus, is barely clinging to life. She says business is off by 60%, many customers daunted by the lack of parking and a gantlet of bottlenecked intersections.
As if things could not get worse, construction workers have been pulled off the job, threatening to leave the street outside her door looking like an open wound.
"It's been a disaster," she said. "We're surviving just day to day."
For nearly the length of 14th Street, the wringing of merchants' hands is almost audible. Already buffeted by recession, dozens of stores have been pushed to the brink of collapse by the $30 million, river-to-river project, business owners and local officials said.
 
Litany of Disasters
 The project has been plagued by a catalogue of problems ranging from the absurd to the maddening. The two-way thoroughfare now only runs west to east; most curbside parking has been eliminated. The state government has withheld millions of dollars in Federal highway funds. And now the New York City Transit Authority is preparing to tear up two sections of roadway that were just rebuilt last fall.
To residents and merchants, it has become a textbook case in bureaucratic bungling and good intentions gone painfully awry.
"They were hopeful that it would be done in a way that would meet their concerns," said Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger. "But too much on this project has proved disruptive and frustrating. They're angry and they have a right to be."
The contractor, Perez Interboro Asphalt, and the city's Transportation Department said that inconveniences were endemic to major rebuilding projects and that reconstruction was on schedule to end by fall. "As far as we're concerned, it's gone smooth," said John Labozza, acting chief engineer for the contractor.
 
'Comedy of Errors'
 That's not the common view along 14th Street. "It's been a comedy of errors," said Joan Talbert, executive director of the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District, a group of landlords and businesses.
Last year, three nuns were trapped inside their convent near Seventh Avenue when workers forgot to place a plank from their doorway over wet cement. An abandoned car that blocked work was lifted onto the sidewalk and left beneath a restaurant's awning for a week.
Sidewalks have cracked weeks after being poured, and many sections will probably be repoured, the contractor said. Dozens of building owners have complained that sidewalk work damaged their property.
The state Department of Transportation says its inspectors repeatedly notified its city counterpart that Perez used watered-down concrete and failed to install adequate pedestrian barriers and cover trenches.
Finding that the city failed to crack down on Perez and two other contractors accused of doing shoddy work, the state withheld $6 million in Federal highway funds last month.
Two weeks ago, the contractor pulled some workers off the job, saying the city owed him $3 million. Crews were scheduled to return to work Monday.
And last week, the Transit Authority announced it was planning to excavate two large holes, one near Avenue of the Americas and the other by Eighth Avenue, areas where reconstruction was completed last fall.
Transit officials said they were instructed by the Transportation Department to excavate. But a Transportation Department spokesman said the Transit Authority was at fault for seeking its construction permits too late.
"We lived it, awoke from the nightmare and now it's going to start again," said Dr. Robert B. Goldberg, a partner in the Chelsea Village Medical Center, which abuts the Eighth Avenue excavation site.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
 
Get It Now, Get It Cheap
 With over 300 stores, 14th Street has long been a discount-shopping hub, generating more than $150 million in sales annually. Storekeepers hawk clothing and electronics, watches and furniture, $25 tuxedos and velvet wall hangings of Jesus, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis.
But the district fell on hard times in the 1980's, with storefronts becoming vacant and crack dealers working street corners. When the city announced the project in the mid-1980's, many local business and civic groups saw it as an opportunity to revitalize business.
They formed a task force to oversee construction and hired an architect whose plans included brass street signs in the sidewalks, new "bishop's crook" lampposts and sidewalks made to look like granite.
Many of the ideas were accepted by the Department of Transportation, and in 1987, a city arts commission gave the plan a design award.
Mr. Walsh hangs that award upside down on his wall because, he says, "The project has been such a joke."
Like many merchants, Sylvester Affam said he would have preferred aging sidewalks to what he has endured. Receipts are down by 50 percent at his business, Marie Antoinette Cleaners near Second Avenue, and his delivery trucks have been ticketed almost daily since No Standing signs were posted last month.
"With improvements, you have to have some inconveniences," he said. "But these improvements are not improvements."
Dr. Goldberg said he turned away scores of patients last summer because they could not navigate the unfinished sidewalks with their wheelchairs and crutches. He expects to do the same when the new excavation begins.
"Much of the damage being done here is to the city's credibility," Mr. Walsh said. "This has made merchants much more pessimistic. Everyone now asks, 'What is the city going to do to us next?' "

Now construction workers have been pulled off the job, leaving stretches like the corner of West 14th Street and Fifth Avenue, above, blocked off; "It's been a disaster," said Daphne Mahoney, the owner of a restaurant, Daphne's Hibiscus, on East 14th Street. "We're surviving just day to day," she said. Business there is off by 60 percent. (Photographs by John Sotomayor/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Mayor and Chancellor: Ties, Often Cool, Turn Icy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins and Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez face the same problem as castaways marooned on an island. While they need each other's help to survive, they also have to wrangle over the same scarce morsels.
Still, last week's clashes over money between City Hall and the Chancellor's office struck many officials as a little too nasty, like a playful fight that suddenly turns bloody. 
 Each side accused the other of lying about whether a $67 million bundle of state aid and a $200 million surplus generated by the Municipal Assistance Corporation were destined for education. Mr. Fernandez, like the anchor in the film "Network," called on New Yorkers to say they're "not going to take it anymore," while Norman Steisel, the Deputy Mayor, described Mr. Fernandez's conduct as "despicable."
 
Icier Than Usual
 While budget battles have their requisite theatrics, officials on both sides say the relationship between the staffs of the Mayor and Chancellor is more distrustful, even icy, than such relationships have been in many years.
"While historically there has always been tension between chancellors and City Hall, at this point in time it's much more real and far less rhetorical than in the past," said Robert F. Wagner Jr., a former president of the Board of Education. "It's not just part of the negotiating process on the budget."
At stake in the dispute is the financing of the nation's largest school system, with almost one million children, at a time when education officials fear that economic constraints could hinder their ability to help thousands of students who have been mired in failure. If the deadlock persists, it could threaten some of the Chancellor's major plans, including his proposals to lengthen the school day and to strengthen programs for the early grades.
The chancellor is hired by the independent seven-member Board of Education, two of whose members are named by the Mayor.
 
Underlying Tensions
 H. Carl McCall, the board's current president, who as a political ally of the Mayor often acts as a go-between in the feuds, concedes that there are underlying tensions between the Mayor and the Chancellor and said he had heard that among subordinate aides there has been "a serious level of deterioration."
On some level, the feud reflects a clash of personalities. Mr. Dinkins is comfortable with glib small talk while Mr. Fernandez is a man who hates to waste time and likes to get to the point. The two have had no more than two or three private chats in the 28 months since Mr. Fernandez became Chancellor.
Neither politician is a model of New Age openness. Mr. Dinkins spends much time working the rooms at rubber-chicken affairs, but far less in quiet evenings with intimates. It is said that Mr. Fernandez's idea of a pleasant evening is staying home watching sports on television.
Lower in the hierarchy, relationships grow even more frosty. City Hall aides have come to dislike Mr. Fernandez's deputy, Stanley S. Litow, seeing him as relentless, even Machiavellian, in pursuit of his goals. Mr. Litow is said to harbor similar suspicions toward Dinkins administration aides like Mr. Steisel and Philip R. Michael, the budget director. Associates say he has compiled a list of more than a dozen instances when he felt double-crossed by City Hall.
 
Opposite Interpretations
 For example, the two sides had diametrically opposite interpretations of the $67 million restoration of aid by the State Legislature. Mr. Litow thought that it was earmarked for education, while Mr. Steisel argued that it was pledged for general city uses. Both produced witnesses and letters to prove their cases.
There have been similarly opposite understandings of whether money furnished for weapons detectors in the wake of two murders at Thomas Jefferson High School was new or taken from elsewhere in the school budget.
Some school officials believe the conflict is the result of political rivalry between a Mayor whose standings in the polls have generally been lukewarm and a Chancellor who has made an unusually salient public impression. Some City Hall aides suspect that Mr. Fernandez wants Mr. Dinkins's job.
In battles with the Mayor, Mr. Fernandez has not always been able to win the backing of the seven members of the Board of Education. "Joe's been smarting over that," said one senior City Hall aid who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 
No Advocate at City Hall
 Many at board headquarters at 110 Livingston Street complain that City Hall has no ardent advocate for education who is ready to tangle with the budget bottom-liners in the way that Mr. Wagner and Stanley Brezenoff did when they were deputy mayors in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch.
The feud must also be seen in perspective. The city's recession-clouded fiscal picture is its worst in almost 20 years. The pie is smaller and the clawing for the scraps is more feral.
"In a period where you have fiscal distress, I think the level of contention rises," was Mr. Steisel's diplomatic assessment.
The board may have a $7.27 billion budget, but class sizes are rising, books are growing more dog-eared and teachers more discontented.
Mr. Fernandez, a paladin called to New York from Miami to straighten a floundering system, is frustrated that he has had to preside over $750 million in cuts and now faces the loss of another $151 million. Yet, fiscal troubles have also made it difficult for Mayor Dinkins to realize his pledge to care for the city's children.
 
City Hall Suspicions
 Many City Hall officials feel that the Board of Education overspends what money it is given and then pleads poverty. Moreover, because power is decentralized among 32 local boards, Mr. Fernandez cannot insure that any money he receives is going to wind up where it was intended.
One person whom everyone is counting on to bridge the communications gap and cool passions is Mr. McCall, who has ties to both sides. He is deft at handling people, but is in a delicate position.
His statements asking for more money are softer than the Chancellor's. He never attacks the Mayor personally and he never charges anyone with lying. And on Thursday, when Mr. Fernandez joined the education unions and several state legislators in accusing the Dinkins administration of breaking its commitment on the $67 million in state aid, Mr. McCall was, as they say, conspicuous by his absence.

Helping the Poor: Some Suggestions

 BODY:
The New York Times asked people who live in the inner city, work there or study it, how to help blighted neighborhoods. Here are some of their answers:

SHAROD BAKER 

Age 17, Senior at Providence St. Mel High School in Chicago. He grew up in the Henry Horner Homes, a Chicago housing project, and will attend Columbia University in the fall:
" Blacks do want black businesses to be in the community but they can't get them established. Banks won't lend to them as easily. The Government has to fund blacks, to encourage them to start businesses.
 "The black businesses would hire blacks to work for them. That would start a money flow. Then children would have a tangible reason to attend school because they would see opportunities, which they have now, but it's hidden, it's so unseen."
 
REUBEN M. GREENBERG
Age 48. Police chief in Charleston, South Carolina
"The only people we can count on is ourselves. We don't hold people accountable for their criminal, anti-social, or irresponsible behavior. You need to stop making excuses for people who behaved that way, as just about every black politician has done.
 "Blacks are more prosperous in this counry than they've ever been. In Detroit, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., there are kids who've never known a white mayor or a white police chief...
 "We are capable of incredible things and we've shown that. It took only 30 years to get from the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama to the Governor's mansion in Virginia. Can the police help? No."
 
KATHRYN EDIN.
Age 29, sociologist with the Russell Sage Foundation. She has conducted in-depth interviews with welfare mothers in Boston, Chicago, San Antonio, Charleston, S.C., and Todd County, Minn.
 "The main problem I see in my interviews with single moms is that people can't live on the kinds of jobs that they're able to get. With the work skills they have and the wages they can command in today's economy, they simply can't earn enough to meet their basic needs. The moms I talk to call it 'the $5 an hour ghetto.'...
"You know, some of those angry black men I see in their mothers' home everyday. Those kids are giving up because they say, "Hey, look, what's out there for me?" If everyone who wanted to work was able to work, the welfare rolls would be virtually empty."
 
JOE VASQUEZ
Age 29, of New York City. Writer and director of the film, "Hangin' with the Homeboys."
"Creating more jobs, --and good jobs. I think job training programs would be a concrete act.
 "I was on welfare since the day I was born. It also helped me get through college. After I finished college and was trying to figure out where I was going to start, and was turned away and not taken seriously because I was a little Puerto Rican kid, welfare called the house and said, 'Look, you're not working and you're over 21, we're going to have to put you in a work program.'
"They put me cleaning toilets at a recreational center, --cleaning up the yard, picking up garbage. This is somebody with a college education. If they put me in that job, with a college education, imagine what they'd do to some guy who dropped out of high school."
 
WILL MARSHALL
Age 40. President of the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington.
" Law and order is first. Under community policing, you take the cops out of cars and put them on foot, on bicycles, in the malls, where the people are.
 "Education is second. Public school choice -- you've got to break the monopoly of the local school boards. Also, establish a youth apprenticeship option in every school, so at age 16 kids who aren't going to college can split their time between school and a local business. And national service, because it would guarantee college aid to any young person willing to put in a year or two.
 "Family and work is next. The Government should give the poor, not just the middle class, the incentive to save and build assets. What we propose is to create a poor man's I.R.A., which would match contributions made by poor people."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Bush Tries to Shift to Active Style on Domestic Policy

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, influential Republicans are arguing that President Bush has reached the limit of the detached style of governing he has favored and must for the first time personally seize control of a broad range of domestic issues, Administration officials said today.
The President recognizes that he has committed himself to such a course in his response to the violence, the officials said. 
 In a radio address today, Mr. Bush said, "My first order of business now that I'm back in Washington is to build a bipartisan effort in support of immediate action on this agenda."
To keep up the impression that the President is staying engaged, he will make an appearance in Philadelphia on Monday to talk about ways to get drugs off the street and residents into jobs.
 
A New Challenge
 But what lies ahead is not only a major test of whether Mr. Bush and his White House team can meet the new challenge after squandering a series of political opportunities this year. It also is a test of whether the new prominence of advisers like Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, who have been highly visible in the last 10 days, will continue or whether they will be pushed back to the fringes of the Administration, where for years they have been arguing for more aggressive urban policies.
Administration officials said there was still debate over specific approaches and that Mr. Bush had rejected suggestions that he strike a radical new course as both unnecessary on policy grounds and politically unwise. Instead, the President will meet with leaders of Congress on Tuesday to discuss reconsidering some of his earlier proposals, like the creation of "enterprise zones" in blighted neighborhoods.
But there appears to be a consensus within the Administration and the Bush campaign that the appearance of passivity is a major political threat at a time when the country has been shocked by the violence in Los Angeles into focusing even more intensely on domestic problems.
 
Message Is Clear
 Officials said Mr. Bush received that message clearly from the rioting and from meetings afterward with civil rights leaders, members of Congress and his own advisers. But it remains to be seen whether he thinks that shifting from a reactive Presidency to an active one is simply a matter of appearances or whether he now feels he has to get the policy engines turning.
"Everyone agrees now," a senior Administration official said, "that the President has to commit, for political reasons if nothing else, has to remain engaged."
In the past, a range of White House advisers said, Mr. Bush has delegated the responsibility for domestic policy -- notably the 1990 budget agreement -- to powerful aides, like the former White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu; the budget director, Richard G. Darman; and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
And apart from his educational reform plan, the President has not pushed hard for the programs he is now re-offering, including the enterprise zones and a plan to help residents of public housing buy their homes.
"The President is now going to be judged not just on whether something passes into law, a senior official said, but whether he's really perceived to have fought seriously and articulately and in an engaged way for policies that reflect his principles."
 
Shifting Advisers
 The rioting forced Mr. Bush to bypass his normal domestic policy advisers, who have kept the Administration focused primarily on the problems of business, and turn to outside help from civil rights leaders and inside help from people like Mr. Kemp, always considered an outsider, and the Health and Human Services Secretary, Louis W. Sullivan, who has been tagged as largely ineffective.
Mr. Kemp, Mr. Sullivan, Administration aides like William Kristol, Vice President Dan Quayle's conservative chief of staff, and campaign advisers like James Pinkerton and James Cicconi, both proponents of so- called "empowerment" programs to revitalize the nation's cities, had influence over the drafting of Mr. Bush's speeches in Los Angeles, officials said.
In the hours following the outbreak of violence in Los Angeles, officials said, advisers like Mr. Darman prevailed with the argument that Mr. Bush must take a hard law-and-order stance. The officials said Mr. Bush shifted direction after a meeting on May 1 with civil rights leaders.
 
'Shaken' by Meeting
 "The President rejected some of the things they argued, like that police brutality is the core issue," an official said. "But he was shaken by that meeting and subsequent discussions with aides who told him how much trouble he was in over a perception that he was uncaring."
As the White House prepared for that night's address from the Oval Office, "the issue was how much Bush should criticize the Rodney King verdict against how much he should call for law and order," an official said.
White House officials rejected a draft by Anthony Snow, a speech writer, that one called "a deep-think piece on racial problems in the United States," and worked off a speech by another aide, David Demarest, that sought a more balanced approach.
Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, along with Mr. Demarest, Mr. Darman and Mr. Kristol, argued "that this was a time above all when you have people being killed and a city burning, and you have to talk about the absolute inadmissibilty of that," an official said.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, argued that the Oval Office address and Mr. Bush's subsequent actions must contain a strong element of compassion, a recognition that things had gone wrong and a vision for change, officials said.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 14, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the effects of the Los Angeles riots on President Bush's domestic policy referred incorrectly to Dr. Louis W. Sullivan. He is Secretary of Health and Human Services, not the Housing Secretary.

HEADLINE: All About/Art Sales;
The Market's Blue Period

BYLINE: By PETER C. T. ELSWORTH

 BODY:
The art market is still in the doldrums, judging from the results of last week's evening sales of contemporary art in New York at Christie's and Sotheby's, the world's largest auction houses. Sales next week of Impressionist and modern art will either confirm or confound that trend.
Just $23.5 million worth of contemporary art was sold, well below the pre-sale estimates of about $35 million. 
 The key sale -- "210 Coca-Cola Bottles" -- a silkscreen painting by the popmeister Andy Warhol, went for $2.1 million, just under its pre-sale estimate of $2.2 million to $2.8 million. Next week, the most important work offered will be a painting by the French modernist Georges Braque, which Christie's valued at $7 million to $10 million last September, an estimate now considered a little high by market experts.
"What has been affected is the level of confidence," said David Nash, head of Sotheby's department of Impressionist and modern paintings. "People have the money, but they don't want to spend it," he said.
The news was not all bad. Lower-priced works sold better, as did most of the works from the estate of a Swedish businessman, Fredrik Roos, indicating at least some firmness for modestly priced, quality artwork.
However, no dramatic recovery is seen looming on the horizon. Instead the market seems to be bumbling along with the rest of the economy and certainly has a long way to go to get back to the high-rolling levels of the late 80's.
Back then, record art prices were as much a symbol of the decade as yuppies and corporate raiders. It all culminated in May 1990 when Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" sold for $82.5 million -- a price comparable only to what might be paid for an office building or a commercial airliner.
Subsequently, the market tumbled as the high-flying 80's were grounded by the 90's and auction results became shadows of their former glory. Over the last two years, not only have prices been down but large numbers of works have failed to sell because no one was willing to meet or go above the reserve -- the minimum price the seller is willing to accept at auction.
"We've hit the bottom and are coming up slowly, but no one expects a boom now," said Amy Page, editor of Art and Auction magazine. "The Impressionist and modern market will take a very long time to come back."
Mary Boone, owner of the Mary Boone Gallery in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, which has represented most of the important artists who emerged in the 80's, was more emphatic. "Where is the bottom of the market? We are in it," she said.

 
 
The New Conservatism
Paying the Piper For 80's Excess
 The auctions represent a secondary market for buyers and sellers to trade works of art. The primary market is made up of gallery owners who often have personal relationships with artists and collectors. As values have tumbled in the secondary market, so have hard times hit galleries, with a number closing over the last few years. The art market is notoriously secretive, and while annual turnover is generally thought to be in the multimillion dollar range, it is impossible to nail down an exact value.
"From what I've heard, the private market has been very slow," said Mr. Nash. "Some things have been ticking over, but for most dealers, it's been a hard slog."
However, sales seem to picking up there too, albeit slowly. "The market has been healthier, more active, with demand more in balance with supply," said the veteran SoHo art dealer Paula Cooper. "There's tremendous interest in younger artists." A younger artist who did particularly well at the auctions last week was Robert Gober. One of his works sold for $180,000, well above its pre-sale estimate of $80,000 to $120,000.
Ms. Cooper said she considers the market healthier not because prices are necessarily stronger, but because many of the more established collectors have returned after being put off by the go-go atmosphere of the 80's. "The pace became too fast and seemed to be more about money than art. They were quite repelled by the whole thing," she said.
Ms. Boone said she believes the questioning now under way in the art world reflects a larger change. "Value in everything is being questioned," she said. "The psychology in the 80's was excess; in the 90's, it's about conservation; it's about determining the value of everything."

 
 
Healthy Bidding
The 'Cats' Man Plays a Part
 The spring and fall sales of contemporary and Impressionist/modern art at Christie's and Sotheby's in London and New York are the indicators of the state of the international art market. While the identities of the buyers' and sellers' are rarely revealed by the houses, the bidding is public. Prices paid at auction affect market values in general.
Last week's sales followed some promising developments in the auction world, although in very different markets. Last month at Christie's in London, the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber purchased "Old House Guards, London, from St. James's Park," by Giovanni Antonio Canale, the 18th-century artist better known as Canaletto, for a record $17.7 million. Later in the month, a set of John James Audubon's "The Birds of America: From Original Drawings" sold at Christie's New York for $4.07 million, a record for an illustrated book.
In fact, other segments of the art market, like Old Masters, Latin American art and memorabilia, which includes everything from cookie jars to baseball cards, have generally fared better than Impressionist/ modern and contemporary art. Sotheby's, for example, estimates that it will sell a total of $165 million to $227 million worth of everything, from art to French furniture to paperweights, through the end of this month.
"The other markets did not boom and therefore did not fall as much," said Ms. Page. "Some of the things, like furniture and silver, have been doing very well. By and large, people did not speculate on silver."

 
 
Flaming-Out Youth
Can the Cult Of Schnabel Endure?
 Ms. Page of Art and Auction saw the auctions as a test for younger artists, such as Julian Schnabel and Eric Fischl, who became popular during the 80's.
At Christie's, a Schnabel failed to sell while a Fischl sold for just under the low end of its presale estimate. At Sotheby's, works by both artists sold within their ranges, with one by Schnabel selling for a record $319,000.
Ms. Boone said that price was still well below the high six figures that were being paid privately back in the late 80's. But she added the prices were good considering the recession and the historical pattern for new artists.
"Historically, every movement has suffered a backlash 10 years after it first came to prominence," she said. "Pop art had a difficult time in the early 1970's; minimalism was questioned in the early 1980's. It's no different for artists like Schnabel, [David] Salle, Fischl and [Ross] Bleckner in the early part of the 1990's.
"Unfortunately, that backlash comes with a major recession in the country, so it seems worse. But it's important to separate the artistic questioning from the financial problems," Ms. Boone said.
Michael Findlay, head of Impressionist and modern painting at Christie's, said he thought the market was correcting. "We've just seen an era when values for works by living artists not tested by time or the market reached half a million dollars," he said. "It's better for everyone that that be adjusted. It's one thing with Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. You know what it is. It's finite. It's another thing with Schnabel. Will he go on, get better or fizzle out?"
"The boom was unprecedented and extreme," Ms. Cooper said. "It's not anything one would want to get back to."
 
 
 
THE POTENT EFFECT OF JAPANESE MONEY
 Most of the record prices made in the so-called 80's art boom came after the stock market crash in October 1987. Japanese speculative buyers of Impressionist art were particularly active during that period and their withdrawal in early 1991 had a negative impact on the market.
"It's difficult to exaggerate the importance that Japanese money played in distorting the market between 1987 and 1990," said David Nash, head of Impressionist and modern paintings at Sotheby's.
For example, three blockbuster sales to Japanese buyers were of paintings by everybody's favorite artist-as-suffering-genius, Vincent van Gogh. "Sunflowers" sold for $39.9 million in March 1987, at the time nearly four times the price ever paid for a work of art. That was followed by "Irises" selling for $53.9 million in November of the same year -- a month after the crash on Wall Street. Finally, his "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" sold for a staggering $82.5 million in May 1990, still the most ever paid for a work of art.
At the time, many art experts marveled at the frenzied Japanese buying of Impressionist works, particularly second-rate Renoirs. That was before newspaper accounts in Japan in early 1991 exposed much of the buying as a front for massive corporate fraud and tax avoidance. Almost immediately, the speculative buying ceased.
Michael Findlay, head of the Impressionist and modern painting department at Christie's, said many Japanese had bought indiscriminately for investment purposes, but cautioned against generalizing. "There always have been Japanese private collectors who operate like any other collector," he said.
The glut of Japanese-owned art raises an interesting question. "The Japanese are sitting on so much. Are they going to dump them at some time?" said Amy Page, editor of Art and Auction.
"The people holding the art don't seem to be in any hurry to sell them," said Mr. Nash, adding there was increasing interest from other Asian nations such as Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
"Maybe the Koreans will buy out the Japanese," said Ms. Page.

HEADLINE: 143 Lands Adopt Treaty To Cut Emission of Gases

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 9

 BODY:
Representatives of 143 countries adopted a treaty today that commits the nations of the world to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases that scientists fear could cause a catastrophic global warming in the next century.
The treaty, its key provisions hammered out in intensive talks over the last few days, is to be signed early next month at the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro. 
 Its long-term objective is to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases soon enough to prevent dangerous disruption of the earth's climate and enable ecosystems to adapt naturally to any climate change. This stabilization could be achieved only by substantially reducing present emission levels.
The treaty calls for industrial nations, until now the biggest polluters, to aim at capping emissions at 1990 levels. But no timetable for achieving this has been set. Instead, the industrial nations would simply recognize that returning to "earlier levels" of emissions by the end of this decade would advance the treaty's overall objective.
 
Not a One-Shot Deal
 But it does require that these countries report periodically to all the treaty signers on their efforts to limit emissions. And in what many said would be the true significance of the pact, machinery would be set up to constantly assess the danger of climate change and to take further action, if necessary.
This approach has been successfully used in the case of chemicals that weaken the earth's protective ozone layer.
"It all adds up to a significant achievement," said Richard E. Benedick, a former United States diplomat who negotiated the ozone treaty and an amendment to it. "It is a very important first step in a process that is going to take us out of fossil fuels," said Mr. Benedick, who is now a senior fellow at the World Wildlife Fund.
The burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas produces carbon dioxide, the most significant of the greenhouse gases. Scientific advisers for these talks say the average global temperature will rise 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by some time in the next century if the greenhouse gases continue to build at current rates.
The proposed treaty is a compromise, and few negotiators said they were fully satisfied. Many environmentalists characterized it as disappointing and assailed its failure to establish clear targets and timetables on emissions, as the European Community advocated and the United States resisted.
Still, said David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council, "if you cut through to the heart of the text, it does in effect establish an international benchmark against which U.S. action will be judged."
The proposed treaty also requires third world countries to develop plans to control their emissions, which are expected to grow substantially. And it commits the industrial nations to give them financial help to do this.
The United States, which produces more than 20 percent of carbon-dioxide emissions, has argued that energy-efficiency actions to which it is already committed will bring it close to limiting emissions in the year 2000 at 1990 levels. But it said strict adherence to timetables might harm its economy.
The treaty's provisions on emissions were described as "a measured approach" and a "reasonable response to the current state of scientific knowledge" by William K. Reilly, administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, who fought within the Bush Administration for a strong treaty.
The one that emerged, according to Mr. Reilly, "says, 'Do what you prudently can to restrain greenhouse gas emissions while pursuing other social and economic goals.'(TM)"
The treaty does not specify how much aid the industrial nations would give to the less-developed ones. The aid would be channeled, as an interim measure, through the Global Environmental Facility recently established by the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Environment Program and the World Bank.
Many developing countries have resisted the idea of using the fund as the financial mechanism for the treaty for fear that industrialized countries would dominate the administration of the fund. The treaty calls for changes in the administration of the fund to reflect these concerns.
The negotiators were supposed to have completed their work sooner, but an attempt by Saudi Arabia to introduce a series of amendments derailed the effort temporarily. Because the Saudi economy is based on the sale of oil, many delegates interpreted the Saudis' actions as an attempt to scuttle the treaty.

HEADLINE: VOWS;
Kyoko Soda and Shuji Nakano

BYLINE: By Lois Smith Brady

 BODY:
ON Friday, May 1, at 12:30 P.M., a jet-lagged but nonetheless lovely Kyoko Soda, 27 years old, married Shuji Nakano, 32, in the chapel of the Church Center for the United Nations.
The bride and groom, who had flown in from Tokyo a week before, arrived at the chapel in a white stretch limousine. Though few people were watching -- only Ms. Soda's parents and two brothers, who had also traveled from Japan -- the bride emerged from the car with the grace of a ballerina onstage. She wore a wildflower headband, a lace veil and a dress with big bow in back and long train, all of it as neatly assembled as origami. 
 It is increasingly popular among Japanese couples to journey to New York for their weddings, said Dr. Melvin Hawthorne, the chaplain of the nondenominational chapel. "In our chapel, it has reached a point of two or three couples a month," he said. For some, it is an economic decision: weddings in Japan are astronomically expensive, far more costly than a round trip to Manhattan. For others, a New York wedding is as fashionable as a closet filled with Levi's.
"Many Japanese couples come here because they want their weddings to be totally Western," Dr. Hawthorne said. "The brides wear a white formal wedding dress, even though there may be fewer than 10 people present. They do a formal entrance, even if there are no guests at all. Though we have Japanese-speaking clergy here, they want all of the service done in English, including vows they barely understand and must struggle to repeat. In most cases, they kiss at the end, which is a difficult decision in light of the Japanese custom of not kissing in public, but they want to have a complete Western wedding."
Moments before the wedding, Ms. Soda, a piano teacher, waited just inside the chapel doors with her father while Mr. Nakano, a photographer, did stretches against a wall. When the organist began to play "Here Comes the Bride," Ms. Soda began her poised -- and well documented -- procession. Three photographers surrounded her.
While Dr. Hawthorne conducted the ceremony, in English, the bride and groom, along with Ms. Soda's family, stood around the altar. Instead of kissing at the end, the newlyweds smiled at each other.
Ms. Soda and Mr. Nakano made all of their wedding arrangements through Yasuhisa Azuma, the New York representative of Altmann U.S.A. Inc., a company that offers Manhattan wedding packages for Japanese couples. The packages, which cost about $3,000, include the limousine (2 hours), organist, photographers, chaplain, hairstylist, gown and tuxedo rental and flowers for the bride's bouquet.
On their third day in New York, with Mr. Azuma's assistance, the couple rented Ms. Soda's wedding gown ("The shop was very busy, so I didn't even try it on," Ms. Soda said through a translator), picked out her flowers and purchased matching wedding rings of interwoven gold and steel at Bulgari.
Shortly after they were pronounced husband and wife, Ms. Soda and Mr. Nakano sat in their rented condominium (not included in Mr. Azuma's package) on the Upper West Side. There was a Cinderellalike feeling to the scene. The limousine was gone; Mr. Azuma had picked up the wedding dress to return it.
Thin and intense, with short spiky hair, Mr. Nakano spoke through a translator about his and Ms. Soda's decision to marry. "There was no need to propose, so we didn't say anything," he said. "It was fate, or 'en' in Japanese. Animals don't propose; they know in their hearts that they will be together."
Why did they endure jet lag and language barriers to get married in Manhattan? "In Japan, the marriage ceremony is family to family, a big occasion," Mr. Nakano said. "In New York, it is individual to individual. We like it that way. Of course, family is important, but the most important thing is the two people getting married. We need only two to get married."
The bride added that it was nice to escape the Japanese ritual of changing three times during the ceremony -- from a kimono to a Western-style gown to a long dress. "I like the simple way," she said. "Marriage is about how you feel, not about how you look."

HEADLINE: Unbalanced

 BODY:
What's wrong with the proposed constitutional amendment to make Congress balance the budget each year? Only that it's wrong in principle and destructive in practice. It may sound like a direct remedy for Washington's toying with trillions in deficit spending. In fact, such an amendment would threaten precisely the long-term investments society needs most and risk pushing a soft economy into icy recession.
 These risks aren't warranted. Congress has to get control over spending on medical care and other entitlements. But that can be done without perilous grandstanding. The amendment is no solution; it's an unbalanced problem. 
Different versions of the amendment are moving briskly in both the House and Senate. Each would require Congress to match cash outlays with cash revenues each year unless a supermajority of, say, 60 percent votes otherwise. The supermajority is supposed to provide flexibility for emergencies.
 Difficulties with the idea start with the very definition of budget balance. By lumping all outlays together, the amendment discourages expensive investment in, for instance, cancer research as compared with short-term giveaways. This indiscriminate definition also invites evasion -- such as loading new entitlements onto the backs of state governments and employers.
 The amendment could do immeasurable harm. When Congress was forced to bail out depositors at bankrupt savings and loans, it wisely borrowed the money. Borrowing for that purpose does not harm the economy. Under the proposed amendment, Congress would have had to cut necessary programs, or raise taxes, by hundreds of billions. No rational business or government would balance a budget this way. Businesses borrow to invest. Even states, required to balance their operating budgets, borrow for capital investment.
 These objections of principle are matched by practical dangers. Now when the economy slips into recession, Federal spending helps break the fall. Spending for welfare and unemployment compensation rises; income tax collections fall. But under the proposed amendment, Congress would be forced to do the perverse opposite: raise taxes, cut spending -- and hammer the economy.
 What makes this constitutional remedy extreme is Congress's responsible record under the 1990 deficit reduction act. This year's deficit, nearing $400 billion, looks gargantuan. But that's because it includes temporary imbalances due to the recession and the S.& L. bailout. Congress has approved virtually no program that wasn't financed with higher taxes. Entitlement growth has slowed; and discretionary spending is headed downward in proportion to the size of the economy.
 There are other problems. The proposed amendment raises grave questions about responsible governance. It makes cutting spending much easier than raising taxes -- inviting the suspicion that its true purpose is to finish the assault on public spending that Ronald Reagan began. But there's one overriding objection. A balanced budget amendment would turn America of the future into a poorer place.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: DR. DAVID F. MUSTO;
Drug Laws and Attitudes in Closer Harmony

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
CONSIDERING the public's shift in attitude over the last 10 years, the possibility of legalizing drugs in the United States as a way to diminish illegal profiteering is unlikely, according to Dr. David F. Musto, a professor of psychiatry and of the history of medicine at Yale University.
He added that contrary to what many who favor legalization believe, allowing open access to cocaine or other substances will not eliminate the street market for drugs or lessen their destructive effects on society. Dr. Musto said that the nation's second drug epidemic is in the declining stage, though he estimated that it would last for 10 to 15 more years. 
 One of the nation's experts on the history of drug abuse and drug policy, Dr. Musto is the author of "The American Disease: Origins of Narcotic Control" (Oxford University Press, 1988) and has testified at several Senate hearings on drug abuse and drug trafficking.
In an interview in his office at Yale University School of Medicine, Dr. Musto discussed the nature of drug epidemics. Here are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. What major developments  spurred the country's first drug epidemic, which lasted from 1880 to 1930?
A. What we consider the drug problem today is the product of scientific and medical advances of the 19th century. Advances in organic chemistry enabled us to isolate morphine from opium, and cocaine from the coca leaf. Morphine was isolated from opium in about 1806 and started to be produced in substantial amounts in the 1830's. Cocaine was isolated in 1860. Then in the mid-19th century scientists perfected the hypodermic syringe. So not only did you have these purified substances, which had never been available before, you also had a mechanism by which it could be injected into tissues or the bloodstream.
Q. What was the public's reaction?
A. When cocaine became available in America in 1884, it was completely legal and came with very high praise from the experts about its safety and benefits. It was also promoted as the first hay fever remedy by the United States Hay Fever Association. However, as the sad stories about the dangers of these drugs became prominent, people began to change their minds and started to become anti-drug. Over the next 10 to 15 years, the idea of cocaine being the ideal tonic changed and the public started perceiving it as the most dangerous of drugs.
Along with this change of attitude toward drugs, the public began demanding legal restrictions. In the early 1900's states began passing laws, at first, restricting cocaine use to a physician's perscription.
Finally, in 1914, the Federal Government passed the Harrison Act, which attempted to bring narcotics under control. Cocaine was still used through the 20's but by the 1930's it had declined. By the 1940's and 1950's few people used cocaine.
Q. Once the Federal Government outlawed cocaine, did there arise a profitable illicit market?
A. Some say that before the Harrison Act, cocaine and heroin were very cheap and that the passage of the act brought about a black market and created new problems with drugs and drug users. But if you look at the history, you'll see that before the Federal act was passed in 1914, cocaine was sold on the streets of New York at about 25 cents for 100 milligrams, even though you could have gone to a doctor and gotten a legal prescription.
In 1908 the average hourly industrial wage was 21 cents. That amount of cocaine in the mid-1980's -- when we had all these laws in place -- would have cost you about $10 on the street, which was also roughly the average hourly industrial wage. This indicates that the street market before the passage of Federal laws had profit margins comparable to today.
Q. Did the laws passed during the earlier epidemic have much of an impact?
A. Yes, because the laws coincided with the rise of an anti-drug attitude. Laws are much more effective if they're in sync with public attitude.
Q. How does that compare with today's drug epidemic?
A. When this epidemic started in the 1960's we had the most draconian measures against drugs already in place. However, like the beginning of the first epidemic in 1880, in the 1960's, large numbers of people thought that cocaine and other drugs were harmless, just so you used them with good judgment. Yet at the same time, we've had very severe criminal penalties. As a result, a profitable black market easily developed due to the gap between the laws and the opinions of a large segment of the population.
Many people thought the laws were ridiculous and not scientific. So unlike the first epidemic, we had severe laws without public support. Since the mid-1980's, public attitude has shifted and we're more intolerant of drugs and once again we're pretty much in harmony with the laws.
Q. Some who argue for the legalization of drugs say that open access will undercut costs from illicit sales, and  reduce turf wars among drug gangs  as well as the economic motivation to lure new drug users.
A. To successfully undercut the street market, you'd have to make cocaine very available in whatever amounts people wanted it. Yet, those I've spoken with who favor legalization don't think that drugs should be freely available, particularly to children. But every obstacle in the path of someone who wants drugs creates a black market. In addition, legalizing drugs is impossible to do politically and morally because the majority of the public is now convinced that drugs like cocaine are very dangerous substances for anyone who takes them.
Q. You said that we are now in the declining stage of the drug epidemic. What are some of the negative characteristics?
A. The great problem in a declining stage of a drug epidemic, which lasts for about 20 years, is that we tend to scapegoat foreign nations and minorities for the drug problem. As drug use among the middle class declines, there was this tremendous pressure to find some simple explanation for the problem. One explanation is that blacks and Hispanics in the inner city are responsible for the drug problem. We blamed blacks for the cocaine problem beginning around 1900 into the 1920's. But the reality is that only a small minority of people in the inner city use drugs. Instead of scapegoating the inner city, we should place our efforts into providing jobs or improving the education of its residents.
Q. What are some of the other myths about the drug trade?
A. There's this image that anybody dealing drugs is making huge amounts of money and is enjoying continued success. But studies indicate that the amount of time someone remains a drug dealer is relatively short. In fact, if you took everything into account, such as the time they may spend in jail on drug charges and how long they actually stay in this kind of work, a drug dealer's income is comparable to the minimum wage.
Q. Is incarceration the answer to solving the drug problem?
A. In the 1920's we also had a tremendous rise in people in Federal prisons who were in on drug charges, around 40 percent of all inmates. Laws can be very helpful when strategically used, but just relying on drug enforcement is not going to end the drug problem. It's very easy for the police to go out and arrest people. But what the public doesn't see is the jam-up in the criminal justice system and the turnstile justice that takes place. The average drug offender in Connecticut spends only about 10 percent of his time in prison.
The reality is that the problem is extremely complicated and deep-seated and comes down to an individual's decision whether to use drugs. The drug problem ends when people change their minds about drugs and stop using them or, even more significantly, don't start using them to begin with.
Q. Of all the popular illegal drugs, isn't marijuana the most likely to be legalized?
A. By 1980 almost a majority of Americans favored the legalization of marijuana for personal use. But the concern about the drug as being a dangerous substance is growing all the time. People feel that it decreases motivation and that it can be dangerous if someone is using machinery or driving under the influence. Its use declined by more than half among high school kids and you can't help but think they have learned something from watching their older siblings.
Q. Given the history of the first drug epidemic, how could we have fallen into another one?
A. The epidemic was simply eliminated from our memory bank. By 1931 all but two states in the country required anti-narcotic education for school kids, but when the drug problem declined, people feared that if you continued to talk about drugs, you might entice kids to take them. We expunged the epidemic from our textbooks. It became policy of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to minimize drug information by dampening discussions in school. The Motion Picture Association of America had a policy that any picture that even mentioned drugs would not receive a seal of approval. If a drug had to be discussed, its effects were greatly exaggerated. So we improved a censorship over the previous epidemic, hoping that if we never mentioned it again, we'd never have another one. Because of our silence and exaggeration, we were later unable to convey a realistic appreciation of the effects of drugs to later generations.
Q. What's your view of the future?
A. Drug use will probably continue to decline over the next 10 to 15 years. We will probably become more angry at drug users and tend to rely on punishment without understanding that we can go too far in this area. However, I think the drug that will be of most concern in the 1990's will be alcohol. It may be put into the position that tobacco is in now. With a decline in alcohol consumption since the 1980's, the rise of the national drinking age and tighter drunken driving laws, along with the concern over fetal-alcohol syndrome, alcohol has taken on a very different image. I believe the image is going to darken even further.

HEADLINE: Focus: Adelanto, Calif.;
Marketing the Credible Shrinking House

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: ADELANTO, CALIF.

 BODY:
THE three-bedroom house that Jim and Lisa Richter bought in this high-desert city 80 miles northeast of Los Angeles is smaller than the house in which Mrs. Richter grew up. The lot also is smaller, as are the living room and the bedrooms.
With a price of $95,000, however, the Richters say they were happy to compromise on space. And they said they are pleased by the traditional look of the house, a two-story structure with a gabled roof, a front porch and a tree in the front yard. 
 "We wanted a house that looked like a house," said Mrs. Richter, a college student and mother of a 2-year-old boy.
As one of the current hot spots in Southern California for first-time home buyers, Adelanto, with a population just under 12,000, is a proving ground for the 1990's version of the starter home. Hard pressed by the rising cost of both land and labor, starter homes here are smaller, more compact, more simple in design and detailing than the typical suburban home of earlier decades.
Interior spaces merge in "open" floor plans. Front and back yards shrink. In most areas -- but not here, where plots average 7,000 square feet -- homes are closer to their neighbors. Wooden trim and other costly finishes have been minimized.
"Fussiness and gewgaws and details -- you don't see a lot of that on starter homes these days," said Randall Lewis, executive vice president of Lewis Homes in Upland, Calif., which built Country Fair, where the Richters bought. It will have 180 homes when completed.
At the same time, builders have been quick to notice and respond to a taste for traditional imagery among home buyers who seem to yearn for reassuring images of stability.
The demand for traditional imagery mirrors the insecurity of the recession, said Barry Berkus of Santa Barbara, Calif., an architect who specializes in production housing. When people feel they are in "a pressure cooker," he said, "they want to go back to their mother's house and the front porch."
Front porches, a symbol of old-fashioned neighborliness, can be found throughout the new tract homes here. And in an attempt to emphasize domestic above automotive imagery, Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation of Los Angeles is offering homes on wide lots, as opposed to the narrow lots more typical of subdivision building, to end the domination by the garage of the front exterior.
As it does elsewhere, price remains by far the most important selling point in Adelanto, despite the emphasis on design. Most homes in the area -- by the end of the year it is expected that 800 new ones will have been built -- are priced below $100,000, or about half of the statewide $199,390 median for an existing home and well under the $136,810 median in San Bernadino County and Riverside. At $69,999, Inco Homes of Upland, Calif., which has built 435 presold homes in Adelanto, claims to have the least expensive new home in Southern California, "at least of which we are aware," said its president, Ira Norris.
The very process of building a house has changed because, to make affordability and imagery work together, home builders and their architects are rethinking the tract home from the ground up -- a change that is especially noticeable in Adelanto because of the high proportion of new houses.
"Every big builder I know," Mr. Lewis said, "has said to himself in the last two or three years, 'Let's re-examine how we build a house.' Developers are going to their contractors and suppliers and saying, 'Let me know how you frame a house, let me know how you run your business, so I can change my way of business and get my prices down.' "
"The most important thing is to build at an affordable price," said Mr. Norris of Inco Homes.
Because home builders have been "overpaying for labor and materials," Mr. Norris said, he has redesigned his homes to complement changing building technologies.
Since suppliers sell kitchen countertops in two-foot sections, Mr. Norris has told his architects to order countertops only in multiples of two feet. Similarly, since sheet rock is manufactured in four-foot sections, room dimensions are to be in multiples of four feet. Most rooms have at least one wall 12 feet in length, since carpeting comes in 12-foot rolls.
Mr. Norris also uses scissor trusses to support the roof; the prefabricated trusses spare the carpenter the task of framing the roof and free the house from structural posts -- a must for the open-space planning that builders find desirable in small starter homes.
To preserve affordability, both builders and home buyers must make tough choices and accept trade-offs, Mr. Lewis said.
"Builders say, 'If I'm going to spend a couple of hundred dollars, should I put that bay window in the master bedroom or put another 10 square feet in the children's bedrooms?' Those are the kinds of questions where there are no simple answers," he said.
If exterior design seems conservative, interior design has changed radically, according to Michael Woodley, an architect and vice president of Kaufman & Broad.
"You design interiors for how people actually live, and the exterior for how people think of themselves living," Mr. Woodley said.
OPEN-SPACE planning can make small houses look large, according to Mr. Woodley, who said that the appearance of spaciousness can be a selling point for new homes. When home buyers open the front door, he said, "The first impression should be, 'This is bigger than I expected. I can live in this. I can afford this.' "
To create a sense of open space, home builders have combined kitchens, dining areas and living rooms into what Mr. Berkus, the architect, described as "concentrated entertainment rooms."
This strategy takes the kitchen away from the walls and into the center of the house and makes it the focus of the household. The sink and cooking range are placed so that people preparing food can face directly into the living-dining area. To compensate for the loss of kitchen windows, architects provide large windows that can be seen from the kitchens.
As kitchens expand, the large living rooms of yesteryear contract, as do formal dining rooms. Lewis Homes has consolidated the dining room and breakfast nook into one space and reports a good response from buyers.
The new starter house must provide privacy as well as openness because even with an open plan, said Mr. Berkus, "you still need retreats." Master bedroom suites are becoming complexes of space, with nooks for writing desks or exercise equipment.
Beyond design, Adelanto has other attractions. One homeowner, Kevin Rathbun, cited "clean air, return on investment and the atmosphere of the community" as his criteria for the decision to buy a three-bedroom home by Lewis last September for about $97,000.
Price, however, remains the ultimate amenity.
"This was the only house we could really afford," said Mr. Rathbun, a manufacturer's sales representative, who bought at Lewis Homes' Country Fair. "To get into a house for under $100,000 in California is unbelievable."

HEADLINE: Shelter for the Rural Homeless: Trees and Sky

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COTTAGE GROVE, Ore., May 4

 BODY:
Millions of Americans will spend at least a night inside a national forest campground this year, but only a handful will ever call one home.
This week, a half-dozen families, most of them from this logging community, started setting up their shelters in the first campground in a national forest set aside exclusively for the homeless. 
 Amid the owls and the deer, the hawks and raccoons, the new residents began assembling a patchwork of tents, tarpaulins and small trailers in an abandoned quarry pit about 40 miles southeast of Eugene, Ore.
The scenery in these Cascade Mountain foothills -- a jungle-like ground cover of ferns and wildflowers shadowed by towering pines and steep cliffs -- is spectacular. But the site for the homeless, although surrounded by luxurious wilderness, is, by Forest Service standards, a barren lot devoid of the amenities found at other campgrounds.
For the next few months at least, Frances Davis will call the three-acre site her home. That will not amount to much of a change for Mrs. Davis, a quick-witted woman of 72, who has squatted in the Umpqua National Forest since November. The $580 she gets each month from Social Security is not enough to cover rent in town, she said, but out here in the woods the dollars stretch enough to buy groceries.
"I told my late husband in 1969 that I would never, ever go camping again, and here I've been living in a campground for six months," Mrs. Davis said. "I guess God is telling me, 'Lady, get out there and give it another chance.' "
Forest Service regulations prohibit campers from staying in any one campground for more than 14 days, but for years, hundreds of people have taken long-term refuge in tents or under tarpaulins deep inside the national forests. Some have lived out of sight in the high country or in thick brush. Others, like Mrs. Davis, have openly set up tent homes in campgrounds, where there are fire pits and latrines.
After tolerating Mrs. Davis through the winter, officials ordered her out of the recreational campground by May 12. She is moving a few miles up the hill to the newly cleared campsite, named Blodgett, where up to 25 homeless people will be allowed to stay indefinitely.
"We have a skunk, a bobcat, a raccoon and a little garden of flowers coming up over here," said Mrs. Davis, as she started to dismantle her plastic-roofed shelter. "It's going to be hard to leave this spot."
Of all the clashes in the national forests between groups like dirt bikers and solitude-seeking backpackers, few are more stark than the friction between the recreational camper and the forest squatter. When hard times hit the oil-dependent states of Wyoming and Colorado in the early 1980's, the campgrounds of the West filled with newly homeless people settling in next to vacationers with $20,000 camper trailers.
 
Winter Under a Tarpaulin
 Randy and Lori Lycett and their two children will be moving into a small trailer this week at the new site. They would prefer it if there were water at the campground and maybe a few more amenities, but for now they are happy to have a place other than the plastic tarpaulin under which they spent the winter in another part of the forest.
"We hope people will get along with each other and not kill this thing before it gets going," said Mrs. Lycett (pronounced lye-SET). Her husband is one of about 600 timber workers who have lost their jobs over the last five years in this community of 8,000 people. Mills have closed because of automation, a recession in the home-building industry and logging restrictions to protect the spotted owl, a threatened species.
The Lycett children, ages 9 and 12, will not be going to school, their parents said. Under Oregon's liberal home schooling laws, the children can be educated by their parents, who are deeply religious.
"The national forest is probably just about the last stop for these people," said C. Daniel Lindstrom, who runs Community Sharing, a private charity in Cottage Grove that is helping to place families in the new campground.
The families are chosen by the charity group, which also helps the families with food and supplies donated by the community. Mr. Lindstrom said about 100 people in the Cottage Grove area of southern Lane County are homeless.
 
Confounds Stereotypes
 The breed of homeless found here is a long way from the stereotype of the urban street dweller. Drug abuse and mental problems are seldom associated with the person who shows up at a national forest campground with sleeping bags and kids in the back seat, Mr. Lindstrom said. More often, he said, they are families who had been supporting themselves with minimum-wage jobs until prolonged unemployment pushed them into the streets.
Persuading the Forest Service, which has a proud tradition of well-built and well-tended campgrounds throughout its 171 million acres, to get in the business of social policy was not easy. Forest Service officials in Washington initially balked at the suggestion, then demanded that the homeless, through their Cottage Grove charity, put up a $1 million bond as insurance against forest fires. It is a requirement routinely demanded of loggers, miners and other long-term users of the national forests.
"We went everywhere, even Lloyd's of London, but could not get insurance," Mr. Lindstrom said. But then the Forest Service backed down, and agreed to set up the campground without the bond, as a pilot program. A similar campground is being considered north of here, in the Willamette National Forest. If the Oregon campsites work, the program may be tried in other forests nationwide, officials said.
"All we're doing is acknowledging something that already goes on in the national forests," said Kent Smith, an Umpqua forest ranger.
 
'Creative New Approach'
 Unlike the National Park System, with its many regulations and restrictions, the national forests have much more land and can be used for a variety of things: logging, mining, recreation, and in this case, a partial solution for rural homelessness.
"We've had this problem, first in the Rocky Mountain states and now in the Northwest," Ann Metejko, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service, said of the squatters. "We've tried not to be callous about it. This is a creative new approach, largely supported and funded by the local community. If it works, we may try it elsewhere."
Some people expressed fear that the new site would attract criminals or people with mental disorders to the area's bucolic forest valleys. But as the faces for the new campsite have appeared -- familiar faces, neighbors in many cases -- much of the opposition has faded.
Already, there is a waiting list for Blodgett, said Mr. Smith, adding, "We're trying to take care of people who live near here first."
Living in the woods, despite the bonus of scenery and clean air, is no picnic. Lori and Randy Lycett have struggled to keep rain from pouring through their tarpaulin. The nights can be cold and sometimes scary for their children, said Mrs. Lycett, whose husband recently found a part-time job to which he will commute from Blodgett.
After six months in the woods, Mrs. Davis has frankly grown tired of camping. With no electricity, she keeps her food in the shell of an old refrigerator. She lives with seven cats, and sleeps on pillows over a wooden cot. Today, during a week of warm weather, black flies buzzed around her head, distracting her from her book, "Murder at the Super Bowl" by Fran Tarkenton.
But even if she were able to get into subsidized housing for the elderly, she said she would prefer something else.
"I don't like the music they play in those old folks' homes," she said, ever cheerful. "I'm a rock 'n' roller myself. And out here, at least I can play my Huey Lewis tapes."

HEADLINE: STATES ARE MOVING TO RE-REGULATION ON HEALTH COSTS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
After a decade in which health costs rose rapidly and many people could no longer afford care, state and local health officials around the country are returning to the kind of planning denounced by the Reagan Administration as a tool of heavy-handed government regulation.
State officials are adopting new laws and regulations to slow the construction of hospitals and nursing homes and the purchase of costly medical equipment. At the same time they are convening groups of doctors, consumers, hospital executives, insurers and employers to negotiate the distribution of health-care resources. 
 In 1974, Congress created a national network of state and local agencies to develop plans for the number and distribution of hospital beds. Hospitals generally had to get approval from a state agency before offering new services or buying major medical equipment. In the 1980's, at the urging of the Reagan Administration, Congress and many states abandoned formal health planning as an onerous form of regulation that choked off competition in the market for health care.
 
$448 Billion Rise in 10 Years
 But from 1981 to 1991, medical prices rose more than twice as fast as the Consumer Price Index for all items. Total national spending on health care soared to $738 billion last year, from $290 billion in 1981. Insurance premiums also soared, and health insurance became unaffordable for many people.
In 1981, the Government spent more than $150 million on health planning. President Ronald Reagan's argument for ending Federal support of the program was that it discouraged competition and protected high-cost suppliers of goods and services. Some California officials still express that view.
But in many other states, officials say the free-market model of unchecked competition failed to curb the growth of health costs and spending. The market, in fact, is not free in the traditional sense because private health insurers and the Government pay much of the cost of medical care, reducing the pressure that consumers might otherwise exert to hold down costs. The Commerce Department estimates that the United States will spend $817 billion on health care this year, up 11 percent from last year.
"Clearly, there's a revival of interest in health planning," said James R. Kimmey, dean of the School of Public Health at St. Louis University. "It comes from business coalitions that see planning as a way to control costs for their members. It comes also through the efforts of state and local governments, reflecting their concern with the problems of the uninsured and the escalating cost of Medicaid."
The White House plans several events this week to underline President Bush's concern about the nation's health-care problems, including infant mortality and the failure of many youngsters to get fully immunized against childhood diseases. Administration officials say the events are part of Mr. Bush's election-year effort to show that he is taking a more active interest in domestic issues, largely left to his subordinates over the last three years.
The President wants to set Federal standards for the underwriting practices of health insurance companies, to help slow the rapid increase in premiums for people with chronic medical problems.
But the Administration has shown no interest in reviving a national network of state and local health planning agencies. And it has opposed efforts by Democratic members of Congress to control costs by setting an overall annual budget for public and private spending on health care.
 
States Take Action
 Ted R. Mannen, executive vice president of the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, whose members produce medical equipment, said: "Unfortunately, it appears there has been an upturn in state regulation of medical technology. States are frustrated by the increase in health costs and are latching onto discredited tools of the past to deal with the problem."
Even in the South and the West, where commercial health-care ventures have been most popular, there is a resurgence of interest in health planning. Georgia and Virginia, for example, have passed legislation expanding the coverage of state laws that require a "certificate of need" for new medical services and equipment.
To be sure, medical technology can save lives and money. But health-care economists say that spending on new buildings and equipment often generates additional spending in later years, as hospitals and clinics hire employees and perform additional procedures to keep the machinery in continuous use.
In Georgia, investors must have a certificate of need from the State Health Planning Agency before they can buy or operate any medical equipment valued at $500,000 or more. The requirement, which previously applied to hospitals, now covers free-standing clinics and doctors' offices as well.
The Virginia General Assembly, which abolished such requirements a few years ago, did a 180-degree turn and reinstated them this year.
Adele B. Cohen, vice president of the Atlanta Health Care Alliance, which represents employers like Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines and BellSouth, said: "We have supported the certificate-of-need law and health-planning regulations as a way to assist in the appropriate allocation of services and capital expenditures. Duplicative, unnecessary health-care services have been very costly to our members."
 
Colorado Governor's Proposal
 In Colorado, Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat, wants to revive health planning as part of a comprehensive plan to control costs and guarantee health insurance coverage for all Coloradans.
In a speech to the Colorado General Assembly on Jan. 9, Mr. Romer said: "In 1987 we suspended the hospital certificate-of-need program. I think that was a mistake. We've seen an explosion of costly and duplicative services since then. Let's re-establish the certificate of need."
New Jersey has established an elaborate new system of health planning that includes a statewide limit of $225 million a year in hospital spending for construction, renovations and new medical equipment.
A plan proposed this year by the New Jersey Health Department would close 15 underused hospital pediatric units and convert six underused hospitals to other purposes, like long-term care of the elderly.
The proposal would also prevent the opening of additional open-heart surgery units, cardiac catheterization laboratories and magnetic resonance imaging centers, because they are not needed. New Jersey already has 80 M.R.I. machines, which cost $1 million to $2 million apiece.
 
Health Planning in New York
 Some states, like Connecticut and New York, never lost interest in health planning. The New York State Health Department approved $2 billion in projects last year, half of them in New York City.
In Kentucky, Gov. Brereton C. Jones has imposed a one-year ban on major new spending by hospitals, clinics and nursing homes so that the state will have time to put together "a comprehensive health-care plan."
The moratorium, imposed on March 26, was challenged in a lawsuit filed last month by two Kentucky hospitals and a nursing home company.
In Missouri, Thomas R. Piper, director of the state's certificate-of-need program, said, "Health planning is coming back into vogue."
Hospitals and nursing homes in Missouri need state approval for any construction project costing $600,000 or more. The current session of the Missouri Legislature is expected to pass a bill that would require a certificate of need for any new nursing home beds, regardless of the cost.
 
More Machines, Higher Costs
 Virginia has just reimposed a requirement for state approval of the equipment used for services like radiation therapy, neonatal intensive care, CAT scans, magnetic resonance imaging, organ transplants and lithotripsy, which smashes kidney stones. Since 1989, when Virginia abolished state review of such services, the number of magnetic resonance imaging machines in the state has doubled, to 58, and spending for other high-technology equipment has risen rapidly.
David G. Brickley, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who sponsored the new law, said: "Our premise in 1989 was that health care was based on supply and demand. If there were more M.R.I. and CAT scanners available, the price would go down. What happened was just the opposite. More machines are available, they're not being fully used and costs are higher than ever."
On April 27, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin signed into law a measure that requires state review of hospital construction projects worth more than $1 million and purchases of medical equipment exceeding $500,000. The state repealed such requirements in 1987.
Under a Minnesota law, signed last week by Gov. Arne Carlson, health-care providers must report any spending of more than $500,000 for medical equipment, services or construction. While the outlays are not usually subject to state approval, the Health Commissioner can require companies to get such approval if they refuse to cooperate with state efforts to rein in health costs.
James F. Ahrens, president of the Montana Hospital Association, expressed concern over this trend, saying: "There's a rush back to command-and-control type legislation intended to restrain health costs. It's an overreaction."

HEADLINE: A Capitalist Itinerary for a Superpower Lecturer;
Gorbachev Arrives in New York for 3 Days of Meetings, Speeches and Fund-Raising

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Gone are the days when Communist propaganda posters showed American financiers with pig snouts and Vladimir I. Lenin railed against the "bloodsucking leeches" of capitalism.
Now, with the Marxist Soviet state defunct, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, its last leader, has been traveling the United States preaching that the world is evolving beyond capitalism and Communism. But as he arrives here today, for the New York City portion of a fund-raising tour, Mr. Gorbachev seems intent on seeing all of the most glittering monuments of capitalism. 
 In his three-day schedule in New York as Private Citizen Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader is to dabble in diplomacy and academia, but also attend a raft of events that will take him from the mogul-packed 75th anniversary party of Forbes magazine, to the New York Stock Exchange, Pepsico World Headquarters and the Economic Club of New York, an exclusive circle of business executives and financiers.
The still-loyal socialist will be rubbing shoulders with Rockefellers and the chief executives of such American business and financial giants as American Express, Salomon Brothers, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Paramount Communications. He is to have a private breakfast at the Waldorf-Astoria sponsored by Dr. Henry Kissinger. And he will receive awards from the Hugh O'Brian Youth Foundation and Yeshiva University.
Last night, Mr. Gorbachev was a guest of former President Jimmy Carter and Emory University at a reception at the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta attended by more than 300 elected officials and chief executives of some of the region's largest companies.
One guest, Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, described the meeting as a "get-acquainted session" with Mr. Gorbachev, who reportedly made no direct appeal for funds. Mr. Gorbachev is delivering a commencement address at Emory this morning.
 
Contrast from Last Visit
 Some of Mr. Gorbachev's former countrymen, who got to New York before him, said it was offensive to see the former Communist leader getting contributions from Americans as he tries to raise an initial $3 million for the Gorbachev Foundation.
"I must live on food stamps and he goes to the bank with his dollars," said Tamara Andreyeva, 59, who emigrated along with her daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren two months ago from Gomel, one of the towns most contaminated by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident. "We didn't come here like him to rob America," she fumed in Russian, still unable to speak English. "We came with sick children."
But Tatyana Gnatyshnyak, 31, who left Odessa three years ago searching for a better life, expressed sympathy for Mr. Gorbachev. "I think even he would prefer to live here, but he doesn't have such a possibility," said the Brighton Beach resident. She wished him well, noting that it was he who loosened Soviet restrictions on travel and emigration. "If it weren't for him I wouldn't be here," she said.
The last time he came to New York, in December 1988, Mr. Gorbachev was in his prime, charming the world as the engaging Communist leader who kept upstaging the West with disarmament initiatives. He made another arms control proposal at the United Nations and met with President Ronald Reagan, who was about to leave office, and with George Bush, who was succeeding him.
As his motorcade raced through the city, tying up traffic, New Yorkers thronged several deep behind barricades to get a glimpse of Mr. Gorbachev and shout out his name. But the visit was abruptly cut short -- ending speculation that the Communist leader might appear on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange -- when a devastating earthquake struck Armenia.
 
A Superpower Lecturer
 These days, with the Soviet Union dissolved and Mr. Gorbachev in retirement, the trappings of statehood will be gone. The New York City police say they plan no street closings for him. The only expected street protest is by an anti-Castro group that has said it will be picketing the Pierre Hotel, where Mr. Gorbachev is to be honored by Yeshiva University Wednesday night.
Yet in its way, this New York visit is as emblematic of the changing world as Mr. Gorbachev's last one, for he is the first former Soviet Communist leader to be seen abroad as a private citizen. With the exception of Nikita Khrushchev, all other leaders of the Soviet state died in office.
Mr. Khrushchev, who made an earlier attempt at Gorbachev-style reforms, was deposed in a coup and left to live out his life in disgrace in a country dacha. "I now live like a hermit on the outskirts of Moscow," he wrote in his memoirs. "I have practically no communication with other people."
Mr. Gorbachev, by contrast, has become a superpower of the international lecture circuit, touring Germany, Japan and now flying across the United States in the Forbes jet, the words "Capitalist Tool" emblazoned dissonantly across its side. "We love it," said Don Garson, director of corporate communications for Forbes, Inc. "I don't think he minds."
 
An Emigre's Wishes
 Today Mr. Gorbachev plans to visit the United Nations, the institution he sought to boost as the new arbiter of world affairs. After a luncheon with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, he is to meet privately with Max M. Kampelman, the former United States arms control negotiator.
This evening, Mr. Gorbachev is to share the stage with former President Reagan at the Forbes magazine celebration at Radio City Music Hall, where the Forbes family will show a new documentary that the company describes as "the history of democracy and capitalism in its successful struggle to overcome the forces of fascism and communism."
Over the next two days, Mr. Gorbachev will intersperse his fund-raising activities with an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations and two major addresses. At the Economic Club of New York, where the most recent speaker, Vice President Dan Quayle, declared New York the proof of the failure of the welfare state, Mr. Gorbachev is to speak on America's relations with Russia. Representatives of Yeshiva University say that Mr. Gorbachev will give an address condemning anti-Semitism at their banquet Wednesday.
In Brighton Beach, the Soviet emigre enclave that is not on Mr. Gorbachev's New York agenda, Izrail Bassov, who emigrated from Moscow seven years ago, praised his former leader extravagantly as a peacemaker and wished him the same well-being in America that he has found.
Enthusing that his adopted country his given him free health care and many unexpected government services, Mr. Bassov, 73, laughed puckishly and said, "Here, we older people have Communism."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Riots Put Focus on Hispanic Growth and Problems in South-Central Area

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 10

 BODY:
Two days after the rioting began here on April 29, several politicians and community organizers huddled in a youth center to forge a strategy for maintaining calm among the city's Hispanic residents, who make up 40 percent of the Los Angeles population.
The meeting was held in East Los Angeles, an enclave of Mexican-Americans that is where most of the city's Hispanic leaders have their political roots. But they could not think of a single Hispanic leader to invite from South-Central Los Angeles, the area that was hardest hit by rioting and that is home to many recent Hispanic immigrants. 
 East Los Angeles, which was largely unaffected by the rioting, has been the home of generations of Mexican-Americans. But South-Central Los Angeles is quite different. The area has long been predominantly black, but in the last few years it has seen a dramatic influx of Latin Americans, many of whom immigrated to the United States recently or illegally.
The area has become a port of entry for Latin Americans coming from disparate cultures and countries, some torn by war, and many of the new immigrants are struggling to make a living in their first jobs in this country.
The changes to the sprawling South-Central area have caught many people, including local Hispanic officials, almost unaware.
 
'Lot of Work to Do'
 "At a time when we really needed to reach out there, we found that we were not as informed as we could have been about who the Latino leaders were in that area," Los Angeles County's only Hispanic Supervisor, Gloria Molina, said in an interview. "All of us have an awful lot of work to do to learn about the changing demographics of South-Central Los Angeles."
In the last decade, the number of Hispanic people, who can be of any race, has increased by 119 percent in that area, while the number of blacks declined by 17 percent. The 1990 census showed that South-Central Los Angeles was 45 percent Hispanic and 48 percent black.
But there is no Hispanic elected official from South-Central Los Angeles, partly because many of the Hispanic residents are recent arrivals. There are few social-service agencies that cater to Spanish speakers, and even in churches where the congregations are becoming more Hispanic, parishioners barely speak to newcomers because of the language barrier.
The riots have aroused the attention of Hispanic leaders about the huge bloc of Hispanic residents in the South-Central area, many of whom are going unserved and unrepresented.
 
Many Illegal Aliens Arrested
 "There was a void there," said Hector de Paz, an organizer with the California Immigrant Workers Association. "No one from the Latino leadership came out during the riots and assured the community that everything would be all right."
The police said that about a third of those arrested in the unrest were Hispanic people and that many were illegal aliens who were promptly handed over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for deportation. Of the 58 people who died in the riots, more than a third were Hispanic people. Thirty percent to 40 percent of the businesses destroyed were Hispanic-owned, although officials with the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation said no one had done an accurate accounting yet.
"Latinos actually got the brunt of this," said Dr. David E. Hayes-Bautista, a demographer at the University of California at Los Angeles and head of its Chicano Studies Research Center. "They got beat up, burned out and arrested. Yet it is still being looked at as a black-white issue."
The Hispanic residents in the South-Central area are mostly Central Americans, or recent Mexican immigrants. Slowly, their presence is becoming more evident. In the shadow of the Watts Towers, a landmark rising over Watts, a row of small and colorfully painted houses are now inhabited mostly by Hispanic families. More than half of the babies born at the Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital are born to Hispanic mothers.
 
Immigrants Moving In
 As blacks have moved out of the South-Central area to better neighborhoods to the west or south, their homes have been bought by Hispanic immigrants attracted by the relatively affordable prices.
Carlos Vaquerano, an official with the Central American Refugee Center, said some moving in are entrepreneurs, who can better afford to begin small businesses here. Others are working at bottom-rung jobs and trying to support families who often live in crowded housing.
Central Americans began moving into the Pico-Union neighborhood, just west of downtown Los Angeles and north of the South-Central area, more than a decade ago, but as that area became severely overcrowded, Hispanic families have made their way south of the Santa Monica freeway to the South-Central area, a place of small California-style bungalows and numerous mom-and-pop businesses now in the midst of change.
At St. Brigid Roman Catholic Church on Western Avenue, a once predominantly black church is adapting for new Hispanic members. Now, one of its three Sunday Masses is in Spanish.
Last week, in response to the riots, church volunteers organized a clothing and food drive to help those who were burned out of their homes or their jobs. All the volunteers one morning were black, but many of those who came to seek help were Hispanic.
"I think a lot of the reason they don't participate is that they don't really speak English," said Iris Glover, who has attended St. Brigid for 11 years. "These are not Hispanics who were born here. They emigrated here. Many people do feel like if I can't speak your language, then I'm certainly not going to intermingle with you."
One priest has tried to persuade the two groups to begin to communicate, especially as they see each other at the church between each group's Mass.
"He told us to say hi to one another, if nothing else," said Ethel Hightower. "He tried to teach us the Spanish way to say hi, and them the English way, but most people don't want to bother to learn Spanish, so they nod to one another."
As Ms. Glover and Ms. Hightower were talking, Jose Humberto Diaz, who said he had recently moved into the neighborhood, came by to ask when they would begin giving out food. The women asked a visitor to translate for them, as Mr. Diaz did not speak English and they did not speak Spanish.
 
Satisfaction With Area
 Mr. Diaz, a native of El Salvador who has lived in the United States three years, said many of his friends were surprised when he decided to move to the South-Central area.
"People asked me why I would want to live here," Mr. Diaz said. "They said it was a terrible neighborhood. They told me that those who lived here did not get along with Latinos. But that has not been my experience at all."
Mr. Diaz, who works at a fish market, told of a time his car would not start. His neighbor, a black who does not speak Spanish, came out and helped him jump start his car with his own van.
"To me, they have been very good," Mr. Diaz said.
 
'Not Just a Black Problem'
 Some of those who work with the Central American community say many Hispanic residents of the South-Central area and other parts of Los Angeles were caught up in the violence after the verdict in the trial of four white police officers for beating Rodney G. King partly because they lack the deep roots in their communities that many Mexican-Americans have in East Los Angeles. Others said participation in the violence occurred because many Hispanic residents suffered from the same depressed economic conditions as others who were rioting and looting.
"The Rodney King incident demonstrated a profound dissatisfaction with the unequal treatment of people of all ethnic races in this country," said Mr. Vaquerano. "It provoked a lot of people who were not happy with the way things are. It was not just a black problem, it is one also for whites, Hispanics, Asians and any one who has human feelings."
Mr. Vaquerano, whose center for refugee assistance is in the Pico-Union area , where many Hispanic-owned businesses were burned, said he saw Hispanic people taking part in the looting like everyone else.
"Some of them were honest people who were pushed forward by the anarchy they saw around them," he said. "They saw others destroying and burning and they thought to themselves, 'We will be left with nothing.' And so they also began looting."
As the Hispanic presence in the South-Central area continues to increase, some community leaders said the Mexican-American political leaders, who are currently the Hispanic political establishment in Los Angeles, will have to accommodate them or risk more of the same kind of social unrest seen since April 29. Dr. Hayes-Bautista has also written scholarly works that portray that as a likely outcome.
There are already efforts to bring more leadership to the area. After the rioting and destruction, Mr. Vaquerano's group, along with Councilman Mike Hernandez, who represents the Pico-Union area and nearby Koreatown, organized clean-up crews, many of them Hispanic.
 
Need to Speak Out
 But Mr. Hernandez and other leaders said they realized that for Hispanic residents not to be overlooked in the rebuilding programs, Hispanic leaders must be more vocal and must speak for those in the South-Central area, where Hispanic residents have not yet developed their own leaders.
Supervisor Molina said this was a good time to lay the groundwork for the newcomers to become part of the political process. To that end, she held a meeting Friday afternoon with Mayor Tom Bradley, the leaders of some Central American groups and other community groups, "to start a unity dialogue."
Even though the South-Central area is not in her district, Ms. Molina sent six of her staff members there to insure that the agencies in charge of the recovery efforts were accommodating Spanish-speakers, too.
Ms. Molina said that many people here, including many Mexican-Americans, would not find it easy to learn the lessons of inclusion.
In the days when parts of Los Angeles were burning, Ms. Molina said, she received several telephone calls from Mexican-American constituents, wanting her to put some distance between them and the Hispanic Angelenos who took part in the riots.
"They would say, "Well, Gloria, it wasn't us doing the looting and the burning. It was those immigrants,' " she said. "They wanted me to denounce them. But I say, let's not let that divide us.
"What happened in South-Central tells us that what we have to do in the future is build bridges with each other."
 
AGENCIES COORDINATING AID
 The County of Los Angeles has issued a list of agencies to which money may be sent to assist victims of the Los Angeles riots.
Several 24-hour telephone lines provide general information on agencies that accept donations. The telephone numbers are, for Central Los Angeles, (213) 686-0950; West Los Angeles, (310) 671-7464; San Gabriel Valley, (818) 350-6833; San Fernando Valley, (818) 501-4447.

American Red Cross Disaster Relief, 2700 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles 90057. Telephone: (213) 739-5200.
African-American Community Unity Center, 944 West 53rd Street, Los Angeles 90037. Telephone: (213) 789-7300.

HEADLINE: 9 Deaths in Gulf: British Ask 'Why?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 10

 BODY:
They were casualties of what is called "friendly fire," nine British infantrymen killed in the closing days of the Persian Gulf war when two United States Air Force jets mistook their armored vehicles for Iraqi tanks and attacked them with missiles.
Nearly 15 months later, the grieving parents of those British soldiers sit inside a high-ceilinged hearing room in Oxford, listening as a parade of witnesses describe how their sons died that day in the desert. They are hoping to resolve the one question whose answer, they say, will put their hearts at rest: How could such a thing happen? 
 Although British and American investigators acknowledge that the American jets fired the fatal missiles on the afternoon of Feb. 26, 1991, the hearings by a coroner's court jury have inflamed a sense of public despair and anger here, since no Americans will be coming to England to testify about what went wrong.
The families and their lawyers insist such testimony is essential because, they say, they have been offered contradictory explanations of the incident over the last year, in part because Washington and London have not been able to agree about who is to blame.
At the heart of the debate is a belief here that the British families involved are being told less than American families who similarly lost relatives as a result of such incidents in the Persian Gulf war. According to the Pentagon, 35 of the 148 United States combat deaths were a result of allied rather than enemy fire.
On the steps of Oxford County Hall on Friday, Peter Atkinson, an unemployed machinist whose son, Paul, was killed in the incident, displayed a photograph of himself and President Bush. It was taken at a White House meeting last fall, when some of the families of the British soldiers killed in the incident were invited to meet the President.
"He told me he was sorry and promised me we would have all the facts, but we still don't," Mr. Atkinson said."
The United States Government has provided the inquest with a 26-page collection of letters and affidavits, including a series of statements obtained from the two American pilots. Their names and units were stricken from the material, underscoring a United States Government decision to protect their anonymity.
The hearings, which are expected to last three more days, will resume Monday morning.
 
U.S. Cites 'Good Faith'
 In a letter, Carl W. Ford Jr., a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, expressed the United States' regret and "deep compassion" for the families. But he said the pilots of the two A-10 jets had "acted in the good faith belief that they could attack in the area in which they were operating."
But lawyers for the family say the statements are inadequate, since British Defense Ministry investigators never interviewed the pilots, and the pilots' statements only underscore what the British have described as "a conflict of edvidence" over what happened.
In recent days, Britain's tabloid press has been ringing with articles sharply critical of President Bush and the Pentagon for refusing to produce the pilots as witnesses.
The hearings, which began in Oxford last week, are described as a coroner's inquest, a judicial proceeding convened at the insistence of the families to force some public determination of the cause of their sons' deaths. In many ways, the process has become less a legal exercise than a theater of despair, a last plaintive public appeal for help by the families, all of them working-class people from northeast England and Scotland.
 
'Let Them Come'

A dramatic measure of their plight were photographs and news film last week that showed Mr. Atkinson pursuing an American military observer outside the hearing room, pleading with him as he chased him down the sidewalk to ask Washington to allow the pilots to tell their side of the story.
"My son is dead," said Mr. Atkinson, close to tears. "Why won't the American pilots come over? Why don't they defend themselves? Let them come. Nothing's going to happen to them."
Mr. Atkinson and other parents say they are not seeking civil damages or criminal penalties against the pilots, since the law provides for neither possibility.
The American pilots say they mistook the two British armored vehicles for Iraqi tanks because they were not displaying colored panels or other markings identifying them as allied vehicles. The British Defense Ministry, as well as witnesses at the hearings, insisted all of the vehicles, 30-ton armored personnel carriers called Warriors, were clearly showing friendly markings.
 
A Corporal's Testimony
 The incident occurred on a bright afternoon as the British forces charged through a breach in Iraqi defenses opened earlier by American troops. At the time of the attack, the two Warriors were among a group of four that had come to a halt in the desert.
When the first missile hit, Lance Cpl. Peter Fyfe said at the inquest on Friday, the men had just returned to the vehicle after stretching their legs.
Suddenly, there was a tremendous explosion. "My mates were screaming and my hair was on fire and pieces of shrapnel were in my thigh," said Corporal Fyfe, who was badly wounded. Three or four minutes later, a second missile slammed into another of the vehicles.

HEADLINE: Executive Pay At New Highs

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The pay of corporate America's chief executives hit new highs in 1991 despite the recession, slimmer profits and widespread layoffs, Forbes magazine says in its latest issue.
Forbes said 407 of the chief executives at the country's 800 largest publicly held companies earned $1 million or more in total compensation last year, up from 386 in 1990. Total compensation includes salary and bonus, noncash stock gains (mainly from exercising options) and other benefits. 
 The top earner last year was the H. J. Heinz Company's chairman and chief executive, Anthony F. J. O'Reilly, who received $75 million, of which more than $71 million came from stock awards.
The second-highest-paid chief executive was Martin Wygod of Medco Containment Services Inc. He earned $34.6 million, followed by Leon Hirsch of the United States Surgical Corporation, with $23.3 million.

HEADLINE: A MIDEAST PUZZLE: TALKS THAT AREN'T

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
The six-month-old Middle East peace process enters a new phase over the next week with international meetings in five capitals on a wide range of practical issues. The talks among Israel and its neighbors will cover arms control, economic development, refugees, water resources and the environment.
Israeli officials repeated today that they will boycott two of the sessions -- the economic development conference in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday and the the refugee talks in Ottawa Wednesday through Friday -- because Palestinians from outside the occupied territories are included in delegations. Jerusalem objects to such participation because it raises issues of Palestinians' right to return to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.. 
 The Palestinians, who are supported on this matter by the co-sponsors, Washington and Moscow, say that these topics, especially the future of refugees, are of special concern to Palestinians outside the disputed areas of the Mideast. The composition and status of Palestinian delegations have been a bone of contention for Israel in the continuing peace process.
Syria and Lebanon have said they see no point in attending the coming talks, which will include delegations from outside the Mideast, until direct discussions with Israel show progress.
 
Weapons, Water, Environment
 Israelis are expected to take part in talks on arms control and regional security beginning here in Washington on Monday, and in sessions on water resources in Vienna on Wednesday and Thursday. Most delegations are also expected to be in Tokyo on May 18 and 19 for discussions on the environment of the Mideast region.
This series of "working group" meetings was intended to complement the central peace talks between Israel and each of its Arab neighbors: Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinians. The working-group talks over the next eight days are expected to culminate in a joint "steering group" session in Lisbon on May 27.
The Bush Administration says the talks beginning here on Monday are not to be regarded as negotiations. Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, has described them as more like seminars at which papers on various topics will be presented and historical precedents recalled.
Miss Tutwiler said on Friday that the Washington working-group meeting on arms control "will include presentations and discussions on the methods and concepts of arms control, the evolution of the confidence and security-building process, the history of the U.S.-Soviet hot-line agreement, and the 'incidents at sea' and 'dangerous military activities' agreements."
 
Recent Chronology
 The Mideast regional conference began in October with an opening, essentially ceremonial session in Madrid. In December, the first of three rounds of direct talks between Israel and individual Arab delegations took place in Washington. A second large international conference was convened in Moscow in January.
Although substantive progress appears to have been slow or nonexistent, particularly in the separate Israeli meetings with individual Arab delegations, negotiators from both sides emphasize that Israelis and Arabs are meeting face to face and that this must be considered a huge step forward.
Arab delegation leaders have warmly praised Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d for his persistence in brokering the peace process and gaining their governments' confidence.
In earlier rounds of talks, progress has been most noticeable in Israeli-Jordanian sessions. The least has been accomplished in Israeli-Syrian talks.
Jordan, however, plans to propose steps in the Ottawa refugee talks this week that are bound to be controversial in Israel. According to reports from Amman, Jordanian delegates will press for the right of Palestinians outside the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to return to homes there, and will also seek compensation for Jordanians and Palestinians who lost land when the state of Israel was created in 1948.

HEADLINE: He Preaches Free Markets, Not Mao

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: DONGGUAN, China

 BODY:
For anyone who thinks of Communist Party bosses in China as old ideologues in Mao suits, Liu Shuji comes as a surprise.
A 43-year-old dynamo who favors well-cut business attire, Mr. Liu uses his tiny Motorola cellular telephone not to mount "political study" campaigns but to recruit foreign investors. One of his favorite economists is Milton Friedman, the American proponent of free markets, and Mr. Liu's aim is to spread wealth rather than revolution. 
 Mr. Liu, the Communist Party secretary for the urban area of Dongguan, one of the richest cities in southern China, is an example of the new breed of Communist officials emerging in towns throughout the nation. Reared in the fervor of the Maoist era, and turned off by it, they today prefer practical policies to promote economic growth through contact with the West.
 
Lens on Local Government
 "The Communist Party and the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are the same in some ways," Mr. Liu said in his elegant second-floor office overlooking the main street of Dongguan. "You can't pressure people to stay in power. You've got to give people a better life and improve the economy. If the economy doesn't improve, then the Communist Party is in trouble."
The party is often a very different creature at the local level than at the center, and nowhere is this more true than here in Guangdong Province, adjacent to Hong Kong. Mr. Liu's pragmatism seems fairly typical of his generation, and in many ways he offers a window into the minds that run the nation's local governments.
Mr. Liu, a soft-spoken man with a boyish face and a mischievous grin, was born to a peasant family in Guangdong. As a university student during the Cultural Revolution, the tumult that lasted from 1966 to 1976, Mr. Liu was one of the millions of Red Guards who made revolution on a daily basis. He became a leader of a Red Guard faction in the provincial capital, Canton, and battled rival groups.
That experience apparently sapped his revolutionary ardor, for Mr. Liu was already a committed pragmatist in the early 1980's when he worked as a local official in the farm town of Humen. The challenge in those days was to apply a national policy that as an experiment allowed the breakup of agricultural communes in backward areas.
"We saw that the experiment worked very well," Mr. Liu recalled. The new individual farming plots were far more productive than the communes. So, without waiting for Beijing's approval, Mr. Liu and other local leaders extended the experiment across the board and allowed the peasants in almost all areas to divide up the communes.
The central Government eventually affirmed that this was the right thing to do.
"We don't resist central policies," Mr. Liu said. "But we can implement the policies flexibly, creatively and practically."
Mr. Liu's flexibility is evident in the remarkable changes in his appearance that have taken place over the years.
In an interview four years ago, when he was deputy mayor of Dongguan, Mr. Liu wore a simple tunic and looked like an ordinary Chinese worker. These days, reflecting the increasing wealth and sophistication of Dongguan, Mr. Liu wears stylish wool suits and is driven around in a red Mercedes-Benz 200 that is scented with Kiss car cologne. His cellular telephone is never more than a few feet away.
The job of Communist Party Secretary includes responsibility for all Government and party activities, but Mr. Liu devotes most of his time to economic development. While the national leadership fulminates about "hostile foreign forces," Mr. Liu strives to increase business with those forces -- particularly with Hong Kong.
Many of Dongguan's 1.3 million people have relatives in nearby Hong Kong, and the backbone of the local economy is the network of Hong Kong-financed factories that make toys, shoes and clothing for export. Some of the factories are partly owned by the city government and generate profits that the city authorities have used to buy Canadian real estate and to set up several dozen companies in Hong Kong.
When he is asked if all this contact with Hong Kong is subversive of Communist rule, Mr. Liu seems horrified at the question.
"We shouldn't be afraid of such contact," he said. "There are many things about other countries that we must study."
 
Favors Slow Liberalization
 In particular, Mr. Liu believes that China must study Western management practices and market economics. He said that while socialist countries have done well in reducing gaps between the rich and poor, they generally have poor service and low efficiency.
Like many moderate officials, Mr. Liu favors political liberalization, but very slowly, to avoid instability that might threaten economic growth.
"Reform has focused on the economy, and political change has lagged a bit," he said. "Chinese go along with that. We remember the Cultural Revolution, and we don't want that chaos again. People want to see prosperity and democracy both, but in a stable way. Westerners maybe don't understand that very well."
In other parts of China, political study classes are held every week or so in most factories and offices and include readings of speeches by national leaders. There is not much of that in Dongguan.
Pressed for an example of whether city workers still go through some political study, Mr. Liu paused.
"There've been some special study sessions," he said. "Hygiene and manners, for example. Now the staff know that they have to wear nice clothes and can't wear sandals to the office."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Further Cut In Rates Is Possible

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Even though recent economic data point to a recovery, a number of credit market analysts continue to assert that the Federal Reserve Board may cut short-term interest rates again by early June.
The prospects for another Fed easing seemed to dim last week after the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment rose by 126,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate slipped a notch, to 7.2 percent. 
 The rise in employment was a bit larger than most economists had expected and was seen by some as evidence that the underpinnings of a recovery are now solid.
"These numbers are very encouraging and consistent with the thought that they are going to do better," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities.
 
An 'Uneven Report'
 But others noted that the report provided mixed signals: job growth, while encouraging, was concentrated in a few service sectors. Moreover, a decline in average hourly wages suggested that consumers would have to spend cautiously.
"There were parts of this uneven report that were weaker than I would have guessed," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "The recovery has not yet turned into an expansion."
Weak growth in the money supply, particularly M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, is another worry, some analysts said.
For these reasons, expectations of another Fed easing "are better deferred than abandoned," Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, wrote in the firm's weekly Comments on Credit.
For the Fed to be convinced that another cut in the overnight Federal funds rate is necessary, said Donald H. Strazheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, it would need to see continued weak money growth, lower inflation and generally weak economic data.
Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm, predicted that the next round of economic reports would help tip the balance toward another Fed easing.
 
'An Unrealistic Sense'
 "When all is said and done, the reports will show the economy did not look that robust in April," Mr. Santow said. "The numbers for January and February gave an unrealistic sense of what was going on."
Even as they acknowledged that economic data and political pressures might force the Fed's hand, some questioned what another quarter-point cut in the funds rate, to 3.5 percent, would accomplish.
There is little reason, for example, to assume that another cut in the funds rate would reduce long-term bond yields, which have been mired in a trading range of 7 3/4 percent to 8 1/8 percent for more than three months. Indeed, bond yields were trading at around 8 percent in the spring of 1989, when the Fed's target for the funds rate was at 9 1/4 percent.
A cut in the funds rate would almost certainly prompt commercial banks to lower their prime lending rates by half a percentage point. But a lower prime would probably not generate a surge in loan demand, Mr. Fine of Chase Manhattan said.
"Credit demand is still weak, and there are still questions about the creditworthiness of borrowers," he said. "Once you get credit extension, the economy will do a bit better. But that is not going to happen to any great degree this year."
What could have a salutary effect on bond yields, some analysts said, would be the passage by Congress of a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget, which is under discussion.
"Whether it is passed by the states or not, passage by Congress could breathe new life into the bond market over the next few months," said Mitchell J. Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
Joseph Carson, chief economist at Dean Witter Financial Services, said: "I find it extraordinary that over the course of the last two to three months we have seen Congress go from a discussion of fiscal stimulus to budgetary restraint. I look at the balanced-budget amendment as an unalloyed positive for the bond market."
 
Successful Bond Sale
 Talk about a balanced-budget amendment may have helped the Treasury successfully sell $10 billion worth of 29 1/2-year bonds at its quarterly refuding auctions last week.
This week, the market's focus will probably be centered on a heavy stream of reports on the economy and inflation.
Of the April data scheduled to be released, producer prices on Tuesday and consumer prices and retail sales on Wednesday seem the most important.
Market participants will be most anxious to see if the sharp rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index for March was an aberration, as analysts have suggested.
If recent forecasts are borne out, the March rise was indeed a blip. Most analysts are projecting that consumer prices will show a more modest rise of three-tenths of 1 percent for last month.
The retail sales figures will be scrutinized closely for evidence of continued strength in consumer demand.
But analysts said a number of peculiar factors in April -- floods in Chicago, abnormally cold weather and earthquakes -- would make it difficult to accurately interpret the data.
Reflecting that uncertainty, estimates on the retail sales numbers range from a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent to an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent. After expanding sharply in January and February, retail sales in March declined by four-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Discovering Justice: Russia and the Law -- A special report.;
Two Novelties in Russian Courts: Defense Lawyers and Jury Trials

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 9

 BODY:
In one courtroom of the Moscow City Court, the hammer-and-sickle emblems, carved long ago into the wooden chairs of the three judges, have been chiseled off. In a second courtroom, just down the hall, a hammer-and-sickle hangs on the wall above the chief judge's head and two still adorn the chairs.
The great transition in Russian life, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Communist ideology, is also taking place in the courtroom. 
 President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev before him, vowed to make the nation a "pravovoye gosudarstvo" -- a state based on law. And many Western business executives believe a true market economy can function here only when grounded in the law, and with a judicial system to support it.
 
The Many Contradictions
 But as in all other aspects of the great transition under way, the exorcism has been only partial, wrapped in ambivalence and contradictions:
*There has been no effort to remove judges who grew up under the old regime, when justice was defined by the Communist Party.
*The acquittal rate at trial has grown, but remains less than 3 percent.
*People peddle goods on the street and dollars are common, but "economic crimes" like private enterprise ("speculation") and possession of hard currency remain on the books.
*Despite much talk of introducing jury trials and reforming the powerful and self-regulating prosecutor's office, a new law has merely confirmed the office's existing powers.
*In all of Russia, there are only about 50,000 lawyers -- including defense and business lawyers, prosecutors and judges -- many of whom are badly trained and still held in low regard. (There are about 770,000 lawyers in the United States.)
*While various drafts of a new Russian Constitution have been floated, the fundamental law remains a much-amended 1977 Constitution, written for a republic within a larger Communist union.
"Oh, if we take our criminal code, we'll see lots of jokes," says Aleksei B. Korzhikov, a Moscow City Court judge for the last 10 years, slapping a paperback copy of the code down on his desk. "The law protecting socialist property, for instance: Does it now cover only the property of Cuba, China and Vietnam, and not our Russian property? It's foolishness. How can we work now? What law is to be used?"
Olga A. Dyuzheva, associate professor at the law faculty of Moscow State University, says: "You can find 'no' in one law and 'yes' in two others, which is very convenient for these shady businessmen of ours."
The problem is equally acute for foreign businesses, which are caught up in long-running confusions about their status and tax liabilities in a state where corporate law remains weak.
 
Inconsistencies
Bright Ambition, Murky Reality
 With the end of the Soviet Union, the legitimacy of its laws also died. But many of the laws of the Russian Federation do not cover all the areas that Soviet law once did, or they have not been revised to take account of new realities. In the vacuum, judges and lawyers are applying old Soviet law, or new presidential decrees, or whichever they please.
"It's a murky situation, and not a happy one," said Kaj I. Hobert, a lawyer with White & Case, one of about 10 American firms representated here. "And it doesn't tend to inspire confidence in Western investors."
And for all the attention paid to street markets, private enterprise and hard-currency trading, they are all still against the law, sanctioned only by a Yeltsin decree that has its own contradictions.
Even more important for Russia, as its leaders talk about creating a free market and a democratic nation, is whether they will allow the growth of institutions in which democracy itself can take organic root: representative political parties, for instance, or a constitution that puts the rights of individuals above those of the state, or an independent judiciary.
 
The Aura of the Law
 At the heart of all these issues, says Mark I. Kogan, a Russian lawyer who survived 12 years in Stalin's gulag, are the law and Russians' traditional attitudes toward it.
Mr. Gorbachev -- the first lawyer since Lenin to become Soviet Communist Party leader -- seemed to root in the law his vision of glasnost and perestroika, the increased openness and political and economic restructuring that were his watchwords. He equated law with civilization, and spoke often of a less arbitrary state.
To Westerners who remember Stalin and the show trials of the 1930's or the treatment of the dissidents of the 1970's, who remember "Darkness at Noon" or even "Crime and Punishment," such an ambition seemed quixotic. But some progress was made. For instance, defense lawyers are now allowed to take a more active role in their clients' cases.
"But I agree with Marx that the law is simply a superstructure for the existing system of power," Mr. Kogan said. "While our old bosses are still running that system, either openly or hidden, and until the people's mentality changes, there can be no real talk of a law-based state."
Genrikh P. Padva, a defense lawyer and now general director of Chadbourne, Hedman, Raabe & Advocates here, said: "The old system was decorative. It recognized its own illegal background, but it struggled to cloak itself in the robes of the law, to acquire the fictional impression of legality."
Now people who support change talk of individual rights, he said, adding: "But among those in power, who grew up in the old system, the attitude toward individual and civil rights hasn't really changed."
 
The Proposals
Balancing State And Individual

For all the talk of constitutional and legal reform, there has not been very much of it.
There are numerous drafts of a new, post-Soviet, post-Communist Constitution for Russia, which is still getting by on one approved in 1977. That document, and laws based upon it, make the state's interests supreme over those of the individual and value the protection of state property much higher than protection of individual property, which is barely recognized. Violations of public order are punished more severely than any violation of individual rights.
In most of the drafts, these equations are altered. The state is recognized as the servant of the individual, not the other way around. But the struggle over this principle continues, said Aleksandr M. Yakovlev, director of the Institute of State and Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
"Unfortunately, the population still equates disorder with democracy, and equates its safety with a strong cop, not a wise judge," he said.
 
A Shortage of Lawyers
 Mr. Yakovlev, a Russian legislator, has drafted a legal system that would re-establish jury trials, strengthen judicial independence, abolish the death penalty and reform the prosecutor system to separate investigative and prosecutorial functions.
Part of the problem is the paucity of lawyers, many of whom are badly trained. Miss Dyuzheva of Moscow State said the 25,000 or so defense lawyers in Russia are one-tenth of what is needed, "and many of them are not really lawyers," having graduated from military or K.G.B. institutes. Others get their law degrees through correspondence courses.
In 1913, a period of jury trials before the revolution, there were 20 times more lawyers than today. Juries were introduced in the 1860's during the reforms of Czar Alexander II, but the 1917 revolution put an end to all that. Mr. Yakovlev is trying to bring juries back, but he is not very optimistic, especially since the Parliament decided only two months ago to reconfirm the status and power of the prosecutors.
 
The Goals of Reform
 Robert E. Langer, a lawyer based here for Chadbourne, says that optimistically seen, the Russians are trying "to re-establish the rule of law and develop an objective, fair legal structure."
On the other hand, he said, "there is a school of thought that says what they're trying to do, as they develop a market economy, is to create enough laws to insure that the Government maintains its control."
Mr. Yakovlev said his greatest hope is in the growth of a large class of business executives who will insist on working laws and courts to protect their interests.
"They will demand the protection of the law, which will be beneficial to all of us," he said. "Only to the extent that market relations become routine and crucial to all, will the rule of law become crucial, too. It's easy to pass laws, but they are forgotten unless they are needed and used."
 
The Obstacles
Getting Politics Out of the Courts
 In a speech last month, President Yeltsin complained about the weak legal basis of Russian life.
"For many years, the laws in this country played a decorative role," he said. "Many of them contradicted both common sense and human nature. They were openly violated or bypassed. Legal and state nihilism are deeply rooted in our minds. An example was provided by those in power, whose life was subordinated to secret orders issued by telephone and mutual cover-up."
What Mr. Yeltsin was describing is "telephone justice," when judges, who were all party members, were called by party leaders and told how to rule.
In fact, said Mr. Padva, who defended many dissidents, "telephone justice was much exaggerated." Judges understood what was required from them without the need for many calls.
Now, post-Communism, there are fewer "concrete interferences," he said. "But the system still exists," he added. "Even now the law of power exists here."
 
Letters Replace Phone Calls
 Judge Korzhikov says that in his 10 years on the bench, he has had few such calls. One he describes, under the old regime, involved an army marshal trying to keep his driver out of jail, but the call came a day late, and the man had already escaped a prison sentence.
"Now I get a lot of letters about ongoing cases from our so-called 'democrats,' " he said. "Partycrats become democrats, but their nature stays the same."
His problems, he said, have more to do with his own low salary (3,000 rubles a month, about twice what the Government calls the poverty level) and his inability to get witnesses to appear if it means they must lose pay.
A former judge, Dmitri I. Plyushkov, is more open. In seven years on the bench during the 1980's, he said, "the general principle for everyone -- police, prosecutor, judge -- was that we were all colleagues in law enforcement."
It was always clear what cases "the higher-ups cared about," he said. "The presumption about the defendant was always guilt, not innocence."
More important than changing the law, he said, is to change people's thinking. "Inside every judge here is this assumption of guilt, and I do not separate myself," he said. "It's difficult to change your attitude toward this person in the dock and see an innocent person."
Mr. Padva, of Chadbourne, Hedman, says a state based on law in Russia is unavoidable, even here: "Historically, it will happen. But for history, even a century is not a long time."
Mr. Kogan is blunter: "You know, Stalin's Constitution was wonderful on the surface. You could find any sort of rights in it."
After being released from the Gulag, he says, he considered it his duty to stay here and work for a law-based state. "I'm old now and probably won't see it," said Mr. Kogan, who is 70. "I'm not sure my children will see it, but my granddaughter, perhaps.
"I have a son and daughter, and I wanted them to be doctors. Why? Because they could be doctors in any labor camp. It took me a long time to squeeze the fear out of myself, and it's not really gone."

The day-to-day experience of criminal law is a tawdry string of drunken stupidities, momentary passions and unthinking greed, as it is worldwide. A defendant waited recently in a holding cell surrounded by armed guards in a Moscow courtroom. (Steven Erlanger/The New York Times) (pg. A8)

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries;
Ignoring Brown, Clinton Focuses on Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 10

 BODY:
Over the next three weeks, Bill Clinton can reasonably expect to win approval from Democratic voters in all the remaining Presidential primaries except possibly the one in California, where he runs as the underdog against a former Governor whose family has been involved in state politics for more than three decades.
Aides to Mr. Clinton say that in most of the remaining primaries he will ignore the former Governor of California, Edmund G. Brown Jr., and will try to give voters a clearer sense of his own personality and his positions on major issues, in preparation for a general election campaign against President Bush. 
 Presidential primaries will be held in Nebraska and West Virginia on Tuesday, in Oregon on May 19 and in Kentucky and Arkansas on May 26. Mr. Clinton's aides are planning a ticker-tape parade to celebrate the Arkansas Governor's homecoming just before the primary there.
 
Seeking 'Reagan Democrats'
 The primary season ends June 2, when Alabama, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana and Ohio vote, along with California, the biggest prize of all.
Mr. Clinton's strategists say that in campaign appearances leading up to those contests, he will test themes intended to attract "Reagan Democrats," those who abandoned the party's candidates over the last 12 years because Ronald Reagan's conservative Republican agenda more closely matched their own views.
"The people of California, just like the people of Pennsylvania, want a discussion of the important national issues," said William M. Wardlaw of Pasadena, chairman of the Clinton campaign in California. "What's important for us is to focus on national issues without being distracted by Jerry Brown. That is the strategy Bill Clinton will follow in California."
Over the weekend, Mr. Clinton began to campaign in California, like an explorer discovering a strange new world. He addressed diverse audiences, from the politically conservative suburbs of San Diego, near the Mexican border, to affluent areas of Pasadena, Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, to San Francisco, where he visited churches and a Mexican-American festival.
 
Chance to 'Define Himself'
 James Carville, senior strategist for the Clinton campaign, said that though the fight for the Democratic nomination had lost some of its intensity, the remaining primaries "offer us a good opportunity to have Governor Clinton get out there and define himself and talk about what he wants to do as President."
Fund-raising needs will be almost as important as strategy in determining Mr. Clinton's itinerary in the next three weeks. His campaign, which has raised nearly $12 million in contributions from 39,300 people since November, estimates that California alone will cost more than $1 million.
The states holding primaries in the next three weeks include more than one-fourth of the nation's population.
Mr. Clinton already has 1,665 of the 2,145 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in New York City from July 13 to 16. Nearly 900 delegates are at stake in the remaining primaries.
George Devanney, executive director of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, said the Clinton campaign was just beginning to organize a network of volunteers in that state. Asked if he had seen any political activity in support of Mr. Brown, he said, "None," and added: "Brown did have appeal at one time, but it seemed to peak during the New York primary. Once he lost the New York primary, interest in Brown waned."
 
Known in New Jersey
 Mr. Devanney said that the Governor of New Jersey, Jim Florio, "has provided information to the Clinton people and has been helpful with fund-raising and organizing," but has not formally endorsed the Arkansas Governor. Clinton aides say they assume that Mr. Clinton is known to New Jersey residents from his campaigning and advertising in New York and Pennsylvania, which held primaries last month.
Sam Barone, executive director of the Ohio Democratic Party, said that "if Brown does well in California, Clinton will have to look to Ohio and possibly New Jersey to put him over the top."
Mr. Barone said: "Clinton has been extremely well organized in Ohio since December, when there was a cluttered field of six Democratic candidates for President. Clinton has the state well wired." The manager of Mr. Clinton's national campaign, David Wilhelm, is from Athens, Ohio, and one of the deputy managers, George Stephanopoulos, is from Cleveland.
Mr. Barone said it was difficult to know how strong Brown would be in the Ohio primary, but he said the former California Governor did not have a broad base of "obvious support."
Looking to the general election on Nov. 3, Mr. Barone said: "Ohio is a classic bellwether state. It's also a quintessential swing state, very unpredictable, and cannot be taken for granted by either party. There is one issue here. It's the economy. If the economy does not significantly improve by June or July, it probably won't trickle down in time to help Republicans here in the general election."
The Ohio primary, originally scheduled for May 5, was shifted to June 2 because of delays in drawing new Congressional and state legislative districts.
In California, Mr. Clinton is not well known. "The California primary campaign is a critical period for Clinton to come into the state and get ready for the general election campaign," said William A. Carrick, a Democratic strategist and consultant in Los Angeles. "He should spend a lot of time here and use California as a launching pad for November."
Mr. Wardlaw, the chairman of the Clinton campaign in California, said: "We start here with Jerry Brown having many built-in advantages, a long history in the state and a reservoir of support among Democratic Party activists, who are important in the primary. Early polls showed Brown with a substantial lead. But I believe the gap will close as we introduce Clinton to more and more people in California. We have nowhere to go but up."
Mr. Brown was Governor of California from 1975 to 1983. His father, Edmund G. Brown Sr., was Governor from 1959 to 1967. His sister, Kathleen Brown, is the State Treasurer.
Philip N. Angelides, chairman of the California Democratic Party, said, "I'd expect Jerry, at the worst, to get 35 to 40 percent of the vote" in the Democratic primary.
In Oregon, Carol H. Auger, executive director of the state's Democratic Party, predicted that Mr. Clinton would win the Presidential primary there by a comfortable margin, because he was seen as "the most viable candidate we have." But she said Mr. Brown would get "at least 15 percent of the vote." Mr. Brown campaigned in Oregon on Thursday, and Mr. Clinton plans to visit the state this week.

HEADLINE: COMMENCEMENTS;
Skinner Urges Service Roles For Graduates

 BODY:
George Washington University conferred 1,290 undergraduate degrees and 1,159 advanced degrees yesterday on the Ellipse in Washington at its 167th commencement exercises.
The White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, who received an honorary degree, gave the commencement address. Mr. Skinner encouraged the students to "cast off the politics of division" so the United States could "build a society in which people respect each other, work with -- not against -- each other." 
 Emphasizing that "the power of one individual" can make a difference, Mr. Skinner cited examples of individual bravery during the riots in Los Angeles.
Mr. Skinner said that "perhaps the most dramatic story was the rescue of Reginald Denny, a white man who was pulled from his truck and then beaten with a fire extinguisher." One woman who saw that Mr. Denny's eyes were swollen fought her way through the crowd and, Mr. Skinner said, asked if Mr. Denny could see. "When he shook his head, she said, 'Then I will be your eyes.' Along with three other blacks, she helped Denny inch away from the rioters and to the hospital," he said.
Mr. Skinner told the students that the most important thing in life is the "call to serve" because it is through self-sacrifice that "our finest discipline and best traits" are developed.
Also receiving honorary degrees were Christopher F. Edley, president emeritus of the United Negro College Fund; the artist Helen Frankenthaler, and Robert C. Maynard, publisher and editor of The Oakland Tribune.
 
American University

The American University awarded 1,000 undergraduate degrees and 395 advanced degrees at the 90th commencement exercises, held yesterday at the Bender Arena on the campus in Washington.
Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, and Adele Smith Simmons, president of the MacArthur Foundation, addressed the graduates of the college of Arts and Sciences.
Mr. Wiesel was awarded an honorary doctor of humane letters degree.
Ms. Simmons, an educator and author, was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree.
Maurice Strong, an environmentalist and the Secretary General for the United Nations' conference on the environment in Rio de Janeiro, addressed the graduates of the School of International Service and the School of Public Affairs. He was awarded an honorary doctor of philosophy in international relations degree.
Other speakers were Sir Ralph Dahrendorf, an economist and social policy scholar, and Allan D. Gilmour, executive vice president of the Ford Motor Company.
 
Syracuse University
 Syracuse University presented 4,885 degrees at its commencement ceremony yesterday. Wendy Kopp, the 24-year-old founder of Teach for America, delivered the address.
Teach for America was founded in 1989 to train recent graduates to teach in underserved urban and rural schools.
An honorary degree was presented to Charles Vert Willie, a sociologist and long time faculty member of the college since 1950.
Betty Jane Myers, a 70-year-old student who began her studies in 1974, received a doctorate in counselor education.
 
University of North Carolina
 David Brinkley, host of the ABC news program, "This Week," addressed the 4,263 graduates of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill yesterday at the university's 190th commencement.
Mr. Brinkley told the graduates, "The end of the Soviet Union, the end of Communism and the end of the cold war has left the world unprepared."
He said this country had become "so accustomed to war and cold war it came to seem normal."
He added: "If we can fix our primary weakness, our politics, and we can fix it, ours will remain one of the great countries of history -- the most productive, the most respected."
Mr. Brinkley was awarded an honorary doctor of letters degree.
Other honorary degrees were awarded to Shelby Foote, the historian and novelist; T. Franklin Williams, former director of the National Institute on Aging; Sherman E. Lee, oriental art scholar and former director of the Cleveland Museum, and Anne Queen, former director of the university's Young Men and Women's Christian Associations.

HEADLINE: Boeing Lays Off Workers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 10

 BODY:
The Boeing Company has laid off 833 workers, the largest round of layoffs this year.
With the dismissals on Friday, more than 2,600 positions have been cut so far this year, with 1,154 layoffs, said a spokesman, Russell Young. He said the remaining job reductions were accomplished through retirements and attrition. 
 Boeing plans to reduce its Seattle work force by 6,500 employees this year. Before the latest cuts, Boeing employed approximately 102,700 people in the Puget Sound area and 150,200 worldwide.
Another 2,123 workers have been warned they could lose their jobs on June 12. Boeing has also warned about 300 workers at its plant in Wichita, Kan., that they could lose their jobs, Mr. Young said.
The company attributed the cutbacks to the recession, reduced military spending and a poor year for the airline industry.

HEADLINE: World Bank Plans to Watch Aid Seekers' Arms Budgets

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
The World Bank said today that it would assess what it called nonproductive military spending by 85 third world countries when deciding how much to lend them in their battles against poverty.
The bank made clear that the amount of loans a country could expect was linked to the strength of its own effort to reduce poverty: greater commitment would bring greater support, weaker commitment would bring less support. 
 Japan and Germany have already made clear that they will look into military spending when they shape their aid programs.
 
Warning From a Congressman
 Representative Henry J. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, has said he will push to take the United States out of international organizations whose lending makes it easier for borrowers to spend money on arms.
The World Bank is the biggest intergovernmental lending agency, approving loans worth about $24 billion a year. Its original purpose was to help poor countries out of poverty. Of the 159 member countries, the United States owns the biggest block of shares.
Now Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union are becoming eligible for its loans.
Critics say the bank has sometimes forgotten its antipoverty goal. In laying out its priorities, Sven Sandstrom, one of the bank's three managing directors, told reporters that in the 1970's its projects were overambitious and there were some failures.
In the 1980s, he said, "we focused heavily on macroeconomic policies and other economic reforms to try to help countries make their economies more efficient and restore economic growth.
"In the 1990s," he said, "we see poverty reduction as the pre-eminent focus of our work."
John Mitchell, a bank spokesman, said that by 1994 staff members expected to complete the 85 country reviews now planned. He said they would include not only the poorest countries, but some that the bank rates as "upper middle-income," like Brazil.
Each country review will try to find what major issues impede reduction of poverty, will look into the effect of public spending, describe the country's safety net for the poorest -- if it has one -- and recommend a strategy and targets.

Still No Upturn For Underwriters

 BODY:
FOR years, investors have been asking when good times will return to underwriting in property-casualty insurance, an industry that has lost money on the business of writing policies and paying claims since the mid-1980's.
Although many property-casualty companies have been able to remain profitable in recent years as a result of income from investments, some analysts are saying the outlook for the industry in 1992 is increasingly bleak. With interest rates down, they say, investment portfolios will no longer provide the same comfort. 
 One bad omen appeared on April 30, when the General Re Corporation, the parent of General Reinsurance of Stamford, Conn., the nation's largest property-casualty re-insurer, released its first-quarter results. General Re, which had a record of consistent increases in earnings, reported a drop in operating profits of 13.8 percent, to $116.5 million from $135.1 million in the corresponding period a year earlier.
The surprisingly bad news, the company said, was not because of problems in any particular business but a result of prolonged price cutting among the insurers whose risks it assumes. General Re's stock plummeted that day by more than $7, to $81 a share, and has not recovered. The stock closed at $81.50 on Friday, down $2.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
At the heart of the industry's problem is what is often called the underwriting cycle. Throughout this century, property-casualty insurers have seen periods of stable prices and underwriting profits followed by periods of low prices and underwriting losses. When low prices and losses last long enough, according to theory, some companies leave the business, prices go back up, and profits return. But the current downturn in prices and underwriting losses has lasted six years, an unusually long stretch. Prices remain weak, particularly in commercial liability lines.
"I think the unraveling of parts of this industry has begun," said Myron Picoult, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company known for his critical view of the industry. "The problem with the property-casualty business has been the exuberant performance of stock and bond markets, which had given the management of too many companies a false sense of security."
Since the downturn in the underwriting cycle began in 1987, the after-tax losses on underwriting for property-casualty companies has risen steadily, expanding by 164 percent, according to Oppenheimer's reckoning. Last year, when the industry reported pretax operating income of $14 billion, it was the result of income on investments, before taxes, of $34 billion. That made up for the nearly $20 billion in underwriting losses.
But with lower interest rates and lower investment income expected this year, and without the benefit of capital gains from a stock market rally, the property-casualty business will soon get into trouble, said Jay A. Cohen, an analyst with Salomon Brothers.
As a result of the worsening outlook for the industry, Salomon Brothers last month downgraded its rating on shares of some generally well-respected companies: Chubb, Safeco, the St. Paul Companies and Zenith National Insurance.
Optimists on the industry might point out that some of the respected stocks, like Chubb and Safeco, have fared well in the last month. Chubb was up substantially, from $63.375 a month ago to $66.50 on Friday, down 87.5 cents for the day. Safeco was up from $42.375 a month earlier to close at $48.50 on Friday, down 12.5 cents for the day. But for the industry as a whole, Mr. Cohen said, "There has to be an improvement in underwriting."
One strange impediment to an increase in prices could actually be the widespread faith among insurers in the inevitability of a turnaround in prices, says Richard Stewart of Stewart Economics, a North Carolina consulting firm that specializes in insurance.
In theory, underwriting losses should drive some companies out of the business, thus relieving competition and allowing the remaining companies to raise prices. But, Mr. Stewart argues, if everyone believes in the cycle theory, most people will stay in the business, just waiting for that inevitable price rise. "If everybody believes the cycle will turn, most people will not get out of the business," Mr. Stewart said. "It will defeat every model the mind can devise."
But Mr. Picoult of Oppenheimer, in his pessimistic view of the industry, offers a perverse sort of optimism. He argues, and many others agree, that there is growing evidence that the industry is seriously undercapitalized, despite companies' claims to the contrary. Since companies need a minimum level of capital to back the insurance policies they sell, Mr. Picoult argues, many companies will be forced to leave some lines of their business.
The result could be a turnaround in the cycle sooner than most people now expect, Mr. Picoult says, although he declines to predict exactly how long that may take. In the meantime, Mr. Picoult says he sees particularly difficult times ahead for some major multiline carriers like the Travelers and Aetna Life and Casualty.

Foiling the Compu-Tappers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The world's espionage agencies are busily re-tooling. Military intelligence is no longer the hot model; technological trade secrets are what the customer wants.
You might think, with foreign economic spies intercepting our global data transmissions, faxes and phone calls, the Bush Justice Department and National Security Agency would be helping American businesses defend communications from prying eyes and ears of overseas competitors eager to steal our scientific advantage. 
 The opposite is the case. In a policy blunder ranking with the adoption of the Smoot-Hawley tariff as depression loomed, the Bush Administration sent F.B.I. Director William Sessions to Congress to argue for a weakening of the devices U.S. citizens use to encode and keep confidential the information our competition would love to see.
Why on earth would President Bush want a new law preventing Americans from using the most sophisticated techniques we can devise to stop economic espionage?
Because, you see, the new defenses against stealing information -- coding software already available all over the world -- work all too well. Our spooks and law officers are worried that they will no longer be able to listen to what Americans and their computers are saying to each other.
Therefore, say our lawmen, let's insist on a system of electronic locks that can't be jimmied by low-level thieves, but are not strong enough to stop the heavy hitters -- "good enough but not too good." In that way, Federal wiretappers and computappers supposedly can continue to break into data networks to help catch bookies, drug smugglers and terrorists.
This is a classic case of falling off the pace of change. In the name of law enforcement, we are making ourselves technologically vulnerable to international criminality. To preserve the huge investment in our old eavesdropping facilities, we are abandoning the field to modern organized crime.
Does anyone seriously think that state terrorism cannot afford the best encryption and penetration software, or that drug cartels cannot buy the latest encryption devices for their money movements?
Sure, old-fashioned wiretaps got Gotti. But not three years ago, with Federal Reserve computers whirring, and the N.S.A.'s Big Ear sucking up global telephone calls -- and with no serious encryption working for him -- Saddam Hussein was able to run $4 billion in 3,000 illegal transactions through an Atlanta bank to finance his nuclear missile development.
The trouble with both our Federal law enforcement and intelligence services is that they have become hooked on yesterday's technology. Electronic surveillance for cops and satellite photography for spooks have become central to their lives; their reaction to the inexorable improvement in encryption is to say to the world of science: slow down.
It won't. In trying to sweep back the tide of change, King Canute-style, the F.B.I. is the front for the intelligence community, which hates to be forced to go back to the difficult days of running human spies. The N.S.A. (No Such Agency) is obsolescent because its expensive eavesdropping is an offensive weapon in the coming age of digital defense.
Wouldn't it be nice to know you can get a key that makes it impossible for anybody -- your competitor, your spouse, your friendly revenoor -- to read the faxes you send and receive?
Wouldn't it be useful for banks transferring money and people making contracts to be able to verify a signature on a document without needing an original copy?
Wouldn't it be a boon to competitiveness for American workers to be able to speed trade secrets through secure computer channels?
Mr. Bush is on the wrong side of this issue (and Ross Perot will take him apart on it in debate) because his mindset is toward old-fashioned spookery and against personal privacy.
In the end, that's what this futile scramble to stop the scrambling will come down to: not to stop the march of progress, not to take tools from counterspies, but to preserve business and personal privacy.
The coming Information Age threatens to be intrusive; the individual will be watched, examined, crowded. At the same time, to the happy tune of "I got algorithm," the computer-telephone complex brings us defenses against its own intrusion.

To Be Father and Bride

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
One can imagine Germany's future as a power of the first rank, but it is not now.
Germany is trying to fill a huge power vacuum left by a collapsed Soviet Union and a declining America -- and it does not have the means. 
 After western Germans drag their eastern cousins to near equality, Germany will begin to reach its full potential. But that is 10 or more years away -- except in Eastern Europe.
For now, Germany's friends and allies, old and new, ask too much of this newly united country. And Germans ask too much of themselves.
They are expected to produce breakthroughs in the free trade negotiations, unify western Europe, lead the aid effort to the ex-Communist east, stop Balkan fratricide and house millions of immigrants. This is more than the U.S. or Japan, two bigger countries with much bigger economies, could do. And it is certainly more than Germany, with its huge reunification costs and its fragmented politics, can undertake.
To be the father and the bride at every wedding, to pay and to star, puts too great a load on German society -- though worriers should be calmed to see how well uptight Germans dealt with last week's labor strike that left garbage on their virginal streets.
Germany is and will be the pre-eminent power in Europe. It has and will have enormous responsibilities. But the West should take some pressure off Bonn, and Germans need to relax a little themselves.
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in his last weeks as the German Foreign Minister, disagrees. "We have to lead -- in partnership with our allies," he insisted from his characteristic slouch in an office he has graced for more than 18 years. That is longer than anyone has commanded the foreign policy of modern Germany, save for Otto Bismarck, the 19th century master diplomat whose portrait faces Mr. Genscher's desk.
"Germany cannot solve its internal problems," he continued, "without solving its external problems."
Mr. Genscher will not rest easy until an "architecture of peace and democracy" are in place from Vladivostok to Vancouver. He wants Germany to be the guarantor of close relations between Europe and America. He wants more binding ties between East and West. He wants Germany to be embedded firmly in a united Europe.
The goals are the right ones, noble and visionary, and just what Germany's friends desire. But they also demand more than Germany can deliver.
Washington now looks to Bonn to save the current GATT free trade round. Somehow Bonn is supposed to produce French concessions on agriculture that seem beyond President Mitterrand's power and disposition to give.
The West expects Bonn to provide the bulk of Western aid to the remnants of the Soviet empire. Yet Bonn already gives far more than others, on top of the $100 billion it transfers yearly to eastern Germany. These sums are already generating financial strains in Germany that will test its internal political stability.
And often when German leaders show the leadership demanded of them, their friends bridle and complain. Bonn had good reason to press its partners to recognize the independence of Croatia. Nothing else had worked to end the bloody fighting with Serbia. Yet Washington and others accused Bonn of catering to domestic political pressures. Bonn had every cause to condemn Turkey for using German arms against Kurds. But when the Turks squealed about Hitler-style interference, few defended Bonn's defense of human rights.
Bonn will also have to pass tough laws to curb immigration. There is no other way to blunt simmering German discontent and a menacing right wing. Yet those necessary actions will be greeted by cries of Nazism.
The fact is that Bonn's allies want it to lead when, where and how they desire -- and even then they do not like it. They want German money, but not German power.
These negative vibrations do not do much for German self-esteem and self-confidence, qualities essential to further cement its democratic future.
There is no crisis here about Germans or German policy. But expectations about what Germany can and should do are too high for the good of Europe -- and for Germany's good.
Mr. Genscher, for all his activism, understands this. "It would be wrong to expect one country can play a master's role in Europe, particularly not Germany."

HEADLINE: Willard L. Thorp, 92, Economist Who Helped Draft Marshall Plan

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Willard L. Thorp, an economist who served three Presidents in domestic and foreign affairs, helped draft the Marshall Plan and was also prominent in business and education, died yesterday at his home in Pelham, Mass. He was 92 years old.
His wife said he collapsed and died. 
 Dr. Thorp advocated international trade and foreign aid to promote prosperity, political stability, democracy and peace. He began a 1948 policy address on America's plans for post-war Germany saying, "A great responsibility is created for any nation which is victorious in war."
Among his influential posts was that as the United States' alternate delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, where he sat next to Eleanor Roosevelt and John Foster Dulles.
Although many of his appointments were in diplomatic posts, he did not shy from controversy. He was an outspoken critic of both Soviet repression and Red-baiting.
 
Active in Several Worlds
 As President Harry S. Truman's Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Dr. Thorp helped draft the Marshall Plan for aid to rebuild Europe after World War II and negotiated the final agreement with 16 other nations. He was also assigned to carry out the Point Four aid program to under-developed nations, a program Truman announced in his inaugural address.
Earlier Dr. Thorp held posts in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs, and in the 1960's he embarked on missions for President John F. Kennedy.
In the business world, he became the chief economist and researcher for Dun & Bradstreet and created and edited its Dun's Review, a monthly newsletter for clients.
As an educator, he taught economics at Amherst College, starting in 1927 at the age of 28, when he was believed to be the nation's youngest tenured full professor. Later he served as a trustee and acting president and ran Amherst's Merrill Center for Economics, an annual conference in Southampton, L.I.
Born in Oswego, N.Y., he grew up in Chelsea, Mass., and Duluth, Minn. He served as a second lieutenant in the Army in World War I. After graduating from Amherst in 1920, he studied economics, earning a master's degree at the University of Michigan in 1921 and a doctorate at Columbia University in 1924.
In 1923 he was among the first hired at the new National Bureau of Economic Research, where he began compiling centralized data. His studies led to the 1926 publication of "Business Annals," a book of economic statistics for 17 countries dating to 1890. Years later he was a member of the bureau's board.
Under Roosevelt, he was named director of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, but the Senate declined to confirm him because he once voted Republican. But he went on to serve in a six-member committee to overhaul tariff laws, was director of the National Emergency Council's Consumer Division and became chairman of the National Recovery Administration's Policy Board.
Joining Dun & Bradstreet in Manhattan 1935 as its first economist, he quickly built a staff to draw economic analyses from the company's vast files.
In 1938 he resumed part-time work in Washington as an adviser to the Secretary of Commerce and a principal analyst for Congress's National Economic Committee on monopolies.
Starting in 1945, he served under four Secretaries of State. He represented the United States at the General Agreement Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva and at the Paris Peace Conference.
His vigorous advocacy provoked a denunciation from the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrei Y. Vishinsky, who said, "We all know that statisticians are liars, that American statisticians are the worst liars, and Willard Thorp is president of the American Statistical Organization."
In the 1950's and 60's Dr. Thorp returned to academia, mainly at Amherst. He was also a trustee at Brandeis University and taught at four other institutions as well.
At the request of Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold, he headed a United Nations mission to Cyprus after the British withdrew from the island in 1960.
For President Kennedy, he headed an economic mission to Bolivia in 1961 and was given the rank of ambassador while serving four years as chairman of the Development Assistance Committee in Paris, a coalition of nations giving foreign aid.
After retiring at Amherst in 1965, he remained active as a speaker, writer and consultant and local volunteer. He was chairman of the Pelham Finance Committee from 1977 to 1987 and town treasurer from 1987 to 1990.
His first marriage, to Hildegarde Ellen Churchill, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Clarice Brows, a lawyer; two daughters, Barbara Gerhard of Las Cruces, N.M., and Robin Frazier of Milton, Vt.; a sister, Margaret Hamilton of Mendham, N.J., and seven grandchildren.

Sound the Alarm

 BODY:
Cliches are not fatal but neither is belching at the dinner table, and life would be more pleasant without either. There seems to be a decline in the overuse of firestorm (to describe everything from the Persian Gulf war to a Medicare dispute in the Senate) and defining moment (whether in Moscow, the State of the Union address or the New Hampshire primary). Every day, however, brings a new wake-up call,
A report on education for girls, one official says, "is truly a wake-up call" for the nation. To the treasurer of Massachusetts, it's the recession that sends a wake-up call to state governments. 
 In Lisbon, Common Market competition has given a you-know-what to Portugal. A Washington Post editorial titled "Wake-Up Call" urged people to face up to wasteful water policy in California; one in The Times described "A Wake-Up Call at City Hall."
When Gov. Bill Clinton addressed newspaper publishers in New York last week, he used Jefferson's words about slavery to describe the Los Angeles riots: "a firebell in the night." He thus demonstrated that there are inventive ways to exhort the public, far preferable to surrendering to cliche. Americans are now getting so many wake-up calls that they may be forgiven, on hearing a new one, for falling back into bed.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Economy;
Despite Recession's End, Bush May Face Unusually Harsh Public Judgment

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials are hoping that the President's sagging approval ratings will surge if the nation's economic recovery continues through November. Economists note that whenever the economy has grown in the six to nine months before an election, voters historically have tended to ignore earlier economic worries and focus on the recent good news.
 But some political experts, including many Democrats, predict that voters will judge President Bush harshly because of the unusually weak economic growth during his Administration. And with the Northeast and California hit hardest by the recession, many of these experts say Mr. Bush and other Republican candidates will have a tough battle in those areas. 
Many Republican strategists fear that economic woes could cause the President to lose California, which they consider a crucial state with its 54 electoral votes and where he won only narrowly in 1988.
 "Even New England, which was the worst economic basket case, is showing signs of recovery stronger than California," said James Q. Wilson, a political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "If we limit the race to President Bush against one challenger, then I think California is up for grabs."
 
Bush Heartened by Jobs Data
 The White House was heartened on Friday when the Labor Department announced that the nation's jobless rate fell for the first time in nine months, dipping to 7.2 percent in April from 7.3 percent the previous month. Most economists say that an economic recovery began taking hold in January, and that the economy will grow at a moderate 2 percent to 3 percent this year.
 "Probably by the time of the election, the economy will not be a negative," said Robert G. Dederick, a Reagan Administration economist who is now chief economist for the Northern Trust Company of Chicago. "I don't think it requires a boom. All it requires is that the economy be seen to be pointed in the right direction."
 Yet many other economists say they will be shocked if voters, even after six months of recovery, give President Bush good marks in November. These economists say that more than at any time since World War II, Americans are experiencing profound uneasiness about the direction of the nation's economy: about declining competitiveness, stagnating incomes and uncertain prospects for their children.
 "Even if economic indicators get better between now and Election Day, the economy will be a reason for voters to make changes rather than a reason for voters to stand pat," said Geoffrey Garin, a poll taker for Democratic candidates. "The American people believe our economy is in deep trouble in fundamental ways. This is not just a matter of a few tenths of a percent in the unemployment rate."
 
Unhappiness Over the Economy
 A New York Times/CBS News poll of 1,530 Americans, taken between April 20 and 23, found that many people were unhappy about the economy. In the poll, 24 percent of respondents said the economy was in very good or fairly good condition, while 40 percent said it was fairly bad and 34 percent said it was very bad. Eighteen percent said the economy was getting better, 31 percent said it was getting worse, and 50 percent said it remained the same.
 "The fact that Bush isn't an odds-on favorite is really the result of the economy," said Alan Rosenthal, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics in New Brunswick, N.J. "The economy has made Bush liable to these charges of no domestic program and no vision. Had the economy never declined, people wouldn't really care about whether he has a vision."
favorable in the Northeast and West than elsewhere in the country. Eighty-three percent of the respondents in the West and 78 percent in the Northeast said the state of the economy was very bad or fairly bad. That compared with 73 percent in the Middle West and 68 percent in the South.
 Mervin Field, who heads California's leading polling organization, commented: "The economy of California is in very bad shape, actually and psychologically. To turn around attitudes, the economy would have to have a striking upturn that the public would have to not just see, but feel."
 If a plebiscite were held today in California over whether President Bush should serve for four more years, 60 percent of the state would vote against him, Mr. Field said. But he said there was little enthusiasm for the two main Democratic candidates, Bill Clinton and Edmund G. Brown Jr. And he said that if there were a vote today in California and the candidates were President Bush, Governor Clinton and H. Ross Perot, Mr. Perot would win.
 Larry Hugick, a vice president with the Gallup Organization, said that if the recent signs of recovery were supposed to help the President, he had not seen it. "We haven't seen any signficant increase in Bush's approval rating on the economy or in general," he said. "The only thing that stands out is people in the South are a little more likely to say things are getting better."
 In the battle for the South, this could help President Bush against his expected Democratic challenger, Mr. Clinton, who is Governor of Arkansas.
 
The South Is Upbeat
 In an economic survey issued Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reported that the Southern states were generally upbeat, with retailers, auto dealers and real estate agents reporting better business.
 In the Midwest, manufacturers, stores and construction companies said they were optimistic, and many factories reported growing order books.
 The sentiment is less buoyant in the Northeast, and many analysts say this will hurt Mr. Bush in November. New England has been hurt by overbuilding in commercial real estate, the banking crisis, layoffs in military industries and the consolidation of the computer industry.
 "I think Bush will have a hard time picking up states in the Northeast because of the economy," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic poll taker. "For instance, it's making Connecticut much more Democratic in its mood."
 The Presidential contest in the Northeast was relatively close in 1988. In his race against Michael Dukakis, Mr. Bush won Connecticut with 52 percent of the vote and Vermont with 51 percent. He won Maine with 55 percent and New Hampshire with 63 percent.
 Mr. Bush lost in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York, and he won New Jersey with 56 percent.
 
One Who Like's Bush's Chances
 Nothwithstanding voters' dismay about the economy, Ray C. Fair, a Yale University economist, said President Bush had a good chance of being re-elected. Mr. Fair predicts that judging from studies of past elections, if the economy grows at a 3 percent rate in the six months before the election, President Bush will win 57 percent of the vote in a two-candidate contest.
 Although many economists expect the jobless rate to remain above 7 percent in November -- up from 5.4 percent when President Bush took office -- Professor Fair says the important factor for Mr. Bush's chances are the direction, not the level, of the unemployment rate.
 "It's not the level of the unemployment rate that counts," he said. "It's that it's changing. It's the change in the economy, not the level."
 Roger E. Brinner, chief economist for DRI/McGraw Hill, a consulting firm based in Massachusetts, agreed. "Voters are so myopic that they vote only on what's happened in the last year on income growth," he said. "It seems that if times are improving they go with it."
 
Anti-Incumbent Mood Is Cited
 Many Democrats argue that with the anti-incumbent mood and profound worries about the economy's long-term health, a swing in the economy over the next few months may not sway as many voters to the incumbent as past studies would indicate. Indeed, other major events, like the riots in Los Angeles, could divert the public's attention from an improving economy.
 "Yes, the economy will rebound," said Neil Newhouse, a Republican poll taker. "But because there are other issues out there right now, it will not have as much of a positive impact on the President as we would have once hoped."
 He added: "I don't think anyone can predict how the economy will play in November. We don't know who the players are, whether Perot is real or not, whether he will suffer the same fate as other third-party candidates and fade in October."

HEADLINE: The Richest Getting Richer: Now It's a Top Political Issue

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton wants to galvanize his audience, he thunders from the podium that the top 1 percent of families got 60 percent of the gains from economic growth during the 1980's and owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.
Governor Clinton, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, had been searching for months for facts to illustrate his claim that America's middle class benefited little from 12 years of Republican rule. The explosion of riches at the top struck him as a perfect vehicle. Not only did the widening gap between the rich and the rest of Americans conflict with traditional notions of democracy, but it also went right to the pocketbook sources of middle-class discontent. 
 "He was reading the paper that morning and went crazy," said Dee Dee Myers, the campaign's press secretary, referring to an article in The New York Times on March 5 that reported on the wildly disproportionate gains of the top 1 percent. "The story proved a point he had been trying to make for months, so he added the statistic to his repertoire."
"The L.A. riots underscore the problem," she added.
 
Response by Republicans
 Mr. Clinton is one of the few Presidential candidates since Harry S. Truman to woo the middle class by pummeling the rich. And the Texas billionaire Ross Perot has climbed aboard the same bandwagon by casting himself as a tax-the-millionaires populist.
The furor over the rich getting richer infuriates Republicans. And they have responded to Mr. Clinton's claims with vitriolic salvos of their own. The Joint Economic Committee's annual minority report accuses Democrats of using Joseph Stalin's approach to rewriting history. Supply-side architects of the Reagan tax cuts blasted the figures as "propaganda, not data." Even the President's notably unemotional economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, said he was livid.
The White House itself took the unusual step of delivering an editorial response signed by the President's counselor for domestic policy, Clayton K. Yeutter. The piece, which ran on the Op-Ed page of The Times on March 24, stressed that everybody gained from the 1980's economic expansion.
Oddly, when the Congressional Budget Office first released its income data -- the numbers that are now being hurled on the hustings -- only a handful of Congressional aides and professional economists paid much attention. And even after the economist Paul R. Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology crunched the numbers and concluded that the major share of the gains in average family income between 1977 to 1989 had gone to the richest of the rich, he had trouble getting anyone to listen.
But Mr. Krugman's arithmetic ultimately crystallized the issue in much the same way that the misery index -- the sum of inflation and unemployment -- confirmed what ordinary voters felt had gone wrong during the years of Jimmy Carter's Presidency. And Mr. Krugman's calculation also helped focus the fierce political debate over who won -- and who lost -- from economic growth in the 1980's.
One reason that the issue remained relatively invisible for so long -- in spite of broad agreement among academic economists that income and wealth have grown more unequal -- is that statistics on distribution are among the mushiest and murkiest in economics. There are literally dozens of ways to slice and dice the data, not to mention hundreds of different data series.
Confronted by Republican legislators after Governor Clinton started peppering his speeches with the statistic on the top 1 percent, the budget office was called upon to assess the Krugman calculation. Several weeks later, it issued a report that gave a number of alternate measures of the gains by the top 1 percent. Every measure showed that the top 1 percent of families reaped an outsized share of the gains.
By one calculation 70 percent of the rise in average after-tax family income went to the top 1 percent, rather than the 60 percent figure that Mr. Krugman had initially estimated and that Governor Clinton has been using. If income gains for the top 1 percent had been the same as for the average family, the budget office economists point out, just 7 percent of the rise would have gone to the very rich.
Adjusting for the fact that families in 1989 were smaller, on average, than families in 1977, 44 percent of the gains went to the the top 1 percent. Budget office economists argue that upward adjustments of the average income gain for all families to reflect that each family's income was spread over fewer people is a more accurate way of portraying what happened to the well-being of families in the middle. Mr. Krugman responds that the adjustment is irrelevant to the question of what happened to the fruits of economic growth.
 
Other Gains by the Very Rich
 The Congressional Budget Office also reports other ways of looking at the gains of the very rich. The top 1 percent's share of total after-tax income jumped from 7 percent to 12 percent, for example. And 25 percent of the $830 billion rise in the aggregate income of all families -- two-thirds of which reflected an increase in the number of families -- went to the top 1 percent.
Most conservatives, including Mr. Boskin, are not happy with the budget office's figures, even after the data were adjusted to accommodate some of their criticisms.
Arguing that the office's data base is flawed, they say that the figures exaggerate the income gains of the rich by including, for example, capital gains; understate the income of everyone else by underestimating incomes in the bottom quintiles; and lump together the Carter and Reagan years by using 1977 or 1979 as a base year.
 
Conservatives' Arguments
 "The numbers show that the worst of inequality seems to have built up between 1977 and 1981," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns and a former budget official in the Reagan Administration.
Mr. Boskin said, "While there has been some increase in inequality in the last two decades, it is far less than some people allege, and its causes -- primarily demographic and labor market shifts -- have little to do with economic policy."
"Krugman's 70 percent calculation is not the answer to meaningful questions you'd want to ask," he added. Besides, Republicans say, measuring income shares in a mobile society is as meaningless as measuring which bubbles are at the top of the blender at a given moment in time.
"The whole concept of a static layered society is false except for the underclass," said George Gilder, author of "The Spirit of Enterprise."
 
Liberals' Responses
 Liberals, including Mr. Krugman, see things differently. They argue that capital gains do not distort the overall income data nearly as much as conservatives have claimed, largely because the fastest-growing component of the income at the very top was salaries.
They also respond that measuring the growth of inequality from 1982, the bottom of the worst postwar recession, as Republicans wish to do, swamps any trend in the data. Even so, they point out, the rich even got richer during the expansionary portion of the business cycle -- a time when the poor usually increase their share of total income.
And they maintain that mobility was just as great in 1977 as in 1989, so the fact that people can move up and down the economic ladder does nothing to offset the trend toward greater inequality.
 
Republicans Foresaw a Problem
 And while no single calculation represents the truth and every data set has drawbacks, Mr. Krugman and others said, a large number of different measures using different data sources show that the very rich have done far better than everyone else.
Take wages. "There is complete unanimity on the facts," said Lawrence H. Katz, an economist at Harvard University.
Finis Welch, an economist at the Rand Corporation and the University of California at Los Angeles, said, "The farther up you were the more you gained; the farther down you were, the more you lost."
The fact is that even before Mr. Krugman rolled his grenade under the tent, the Republicans had recognized inequality as a potential political bombshell and had attempted to defuse it. Two out of nine chapters in this year's Economic Report of the President, for example, tackled the touchy topic.
Though the report acknowledges that the well-off gained more than anyone else, that poverty was higher in 1989 than in 1979, and that the income prospects of families headed by younger and less-educated workers were dismal, its main emphasis is on overall growth, rather than on how much more some benefited than others.
"It's much more important for economic policy to promote growth in family incomes than to redistribute it," Mr. Boskin said.
But some conservatives are fuming because of what they see as the White House's wimpishness on this issue. "The White House is terribly ill suited to take this issue on," said a Republican aide who spoke on the condition that he not be named. "Who's going to fight the fight over fairness? Nicholas Brady? Robert Mossbacher? George Bush? Dan Quayle? There's no one there who comes from the middle class."
And some Republicans are upset by the notion that some folks at the top got there not by hard work, entrepreneurship or even luck, but by pure thievery, often at the expense of middle-class consumers or taxpayers.
"Voters are less happy with the people at the top," said Kevin P. Phillips, the political commentator and author of "The Politics of Rich and Poor." "By the end of the 1980's, Horatio Alger got replaced by Charles Keating, Michael Milken and Leona Helmsley."
And Edward Gillespie, the Republican staff director of the Joint Economic Committee, said: "People are concerned whether their kids can do better than they did. When the economy is stagnating and middle-class workers are losing jobs, it's easier to stoke the class war."
But Richard B. Freeman, an economist at Harvard University, said, "If everybody had done better -- even if Donald Trump had gotten three times wealthier -- we wouldn't be worrying about inequality."

Even so, they point out, the rich even got richer during the expansionary portion of the business cycle -- a time when the poor usually increase their share of total income.
And they maintain that mobility was just as great in 1977 as in 1989, so the fact that people can move up and down the economic ladder does nothing to offset the trend toward greater inequality.
 
Republicans Foresaw a Problem
 And while no single calculation represents the truth and every data set has drawbacks, Mr. Krugman and others said, a large number of different measures using different data sources show that the very rich have done far better than everyone else.
Take wages. "There is complete unanimity on the facts," said Lawrence H. Katz, an economist at Harvard University.
Finis Welch, an economist at the Rand Corporation and the University of California at Los Angeles, said, "The farther up you were the more you gained; the farther down you were, the more you lost."
The fact is that even before Mr. Krugman rolled his grenade under the tent, the Republicans had recognized inequality as a potential political bombshell and had attempted to defuse it. Two out of nine chapters in this year's Economic Report of the President, for example, tackled the touchy topic.
Though the report acknowledges that the well-off gained more than anyone else, that poverty was higher in 1989 than in 1979, and that the income prospects of families headed by younger and less-educated workers were dismal, its main emphasis is on overall growth, rather than on how much more some benefited than others.
"It's much more important for economic policy to promote growth in family incomes than to redistribute it," Mr. Boskin said.
But some conservatives are fuming because of what they see as the White House's wimpishness on this issue. "The White House is terribly ill suited to take this issue on," said a Republican aide who spoke on the condition that he not be named. "Who's going to fight the fight over fairness? Nicholas Brady? Robert Mossbacher? George Bush? Dan Quayle? There's no one there who comes from the middle class."
And some Republicans are upset by the notion that some folks at the top got there not by hard work, entrepreneurship or even luck, but by pure thievery, often at the expense of middle-class consumers or taxpayers.
"Voters are less happy with the people at the top," said Kevin P. Phillips, the political commentator and author of "The Politics of Rich and Poor." "By the end of the 1980's, Horatio Alger got replaced by Charles Keating, Michael Milken and Leona Helmsley."
And Edward Gillespie, the Republican staff director of the Joint Economic Committee, said: "People are concerned whether their kids can do better than they did. When the economy is stagnating and middle-class workers are losing jobs, it's easier to stoke the class war."
But Richard B. Freeman, an economist at Harvard University, said, "If everybody had done better -- even if Donald Trump had gotten three times wealthier -- we wouldn't be worrying about inequality."

Table: "Two Views of Changes in Family Income"
How total family income was divided among categories of families in 1977 and 1989, and each group's share of the overall gain in income over the same span of years. The first set of figures is based on the acutal income of families. The second set is adjusted for the shrinking size of average families during the period.

HEADLINE: Big Bird and Other Subversives

BYLINE: By Patricia Kean; Patricia Kean is writing a book of essays.

 BODY:
What's big, yellow and has a radical agenda? Now it can be told: It's Big Bird. Grown fat and happy off your tax dollars, he's the one to blame for a wide variety of urban ills.
Laurence Jarvik, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation, was the first to see the vulture in that mass of feathers. In an interview in this newspaper last month, he charged that " 'Sesame Street' is just another kid's show, no better than 'Underdog' or 'The Flintstones.' " No better certainly, and potentially a serious threat, as Mr. Jarvik goes on to prove. "What did the taxpayers get for their investment in 'Sesame Street?' A generation of kids who spray graffiti on the walls of New York City. If 'Sesame Street' was so effective, why do we have such a literacy problem?" 
 Why, indeed? Suddenly the scales drop from our eyes. If it weren't for the insidious doings of the Children's Television Workshop, we'd be way ahead of the Japanese. Until the Heritage Foundation came along, most of us failed to see the links between Bert, Ernie and declining S.A.T. scores.
Sadly, it doesn't stop there. New evidence also shows that the public television gang is behind global warming, short skirts, the House banking scam and Pat Buchanan's candidacy. One thing is certain: The muppets didn't act alone. Somebody gave them a hand.
There's already an all-points bulletin out on a goofy looking guy whose tastes run to baggy cardigans. A real cool customer, he speaks in measured tones, does everything nice and slow and ties his shoelaces pretty as you please. Goes by the name of Rogers. Street name: "Mister." From the looks of him, butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. But he's wanted for taking generations of innocent youths on a magic trolley ride to a neighborhood of make believe riddled with fairies, elves and welfare queens.
For adults only, they have another con man, a real smoothie who speaks a mean BBC and has a way with a plot summary. Off camera, though, Alistair is strictly veneer, Naugahyde and a well-thumbed collection of Cliffs Notes. Every Sunday, "Cookie" works the same crowd, the easy marks with the big bucks, the good teeth and the Volvos. Before they know what's hit them, they've missed the latest Valerie Bertinelli flick and are hooked on a grueling, 12-part Evelyn Waugh masterpiece.
Who laid the foundation for all this? Most whisper it's the master carpenter himself. Norm appears out of nowhere, restoring this old house, then that old house, undermining the family structure as he goes. Children adore him. As a result, their Sheetrock-impaired dads slink away, take to hard liquor and eventually apply for public assistance. There's also Norm's effect on the economy. And what of the eggheads who clog our emergency rooms, all because Norm convinced them that being historically correct means handling easy-to-use power tools?
But before we join Mr. Jarvik in his cry for "Underdog," maybe we should take a closer look at his heroes. True, "Underdog" never took a dime of Federal funds, but something about his name sounds vaguely Democratic. In a certain light, he looks a lot like Paul Tsongas, and then there's the matter of his relationship with Polly "Sweet Polly" Purebread, and those secret energy pills he kept popping.
With Fred and Barney, though, you've got basic American values. Both were conservative Republicans, Goldwater men. They drank beer, bowled and worked at the quarry, while Wilma and Betty stayed home and made the Brontoburgers. You know what? This country could use a few more characters just like them. But until Congress reins in PBS -- they're expected to consider doing so this week -- we'll continue to watch in horror as our children count aloud from one to 10 and spray-paint tags like "Grover" and "Kermit" all over town.

HEADLINE: UTILITY IS SELLING RIGHT TO POLLUTE

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Two utilities hundreds of miles apart will announce today that they have signed a contract that calls for one to buy from the other the right to emit a chemical that causes acid rain, freeing the dirtier one from having to clean up its own plants as stringently.
It is the first such deal to be publicly disclosed, say those involved and other experts, and could break the ice for dozens of similar deals. 
 The Tennessee Valley Authority will buy the right to emit 10,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, the main cause of acid rain, from Wisconsin Power and Light. The Wisconsin company will reduce its emissions to a level 10,000 tons below what Federal law requires, and the T.V.A. will get additional time to install smokestack scrubbers or replace high-sulfur coal with cleaner fuels.
 
Deal Over $2.5 Million
 The price was not disclosed but is believed to be around $2.5 million to $3 million.
The deal was made under a system established in the Clean Air Act of 1990 and will be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Acid rain, which is believed to be responsible for severe damage to lakes and forests, is one of two main targets of the Clean Air Act. The other target is smog and toxic chemical emissions.
Economists and some environmentalists have long called for a "market-based" system that encourages deals like the one to be announced today. They say such a system reduces the cost to the economy of cutting sulfur emissions, compared with a "command and control" system of ordering each utility to comply. The goal of the Clean Air Act is to reduce such emissions by 10 million tons a year. The T.V.A. is buying "emission allowances" because it believes that at least in the short run the purchase price is less than what it would cost to clean up its own plants enough. For its part, Wisconsin Power can turn a profit by "overcomplying" with the Federal law and selling the allowances.
The idea of trading emission allowances has generally won praise as creating a "win-win" deal, in which costs are minimized and everyone benefits. Some authorities estimate a savings of 20 percent compared with making each utility comply.
Such deals create the possibility that sulfur dioxide emissions will fall more in some locations than in others. In most cases, a local group that opposed plans by a utility to buy emission allowances rather than cut emissions could presumably contest the decision before state regulators, but in this case opponents, if they emerge, would appear to have few options because the T.V.A. is not subject to such state regulation.
But the 10,000 tons represents only a small fraction of the reduction required at the T.V.A., and the authority anticipates meeting the rest of it internally. In fact, experts say that most utilities that buy allowances will meet only a portion of their needs that way.
Utilities have thus far been slow to strike such deals. Since the first phase of the law takes effect in 1995 and scrubbers usually take 36 months to build, some appear to have decided to forgo the market.
But this deal could lead the way for others, said John S. Palmisano, president of Aer*x, a subsidiary of Electronic Data Systems, which is seeking to broker similar arrangements. "It's like going to a church dance, with the boys on one side and the girls on another," he said. "Sooner or later, somebody's going to walk into the middle."
This deal will form a benchmark, he said, with other potential buyers and sellers wanting to peg their prices against this one.
John B. Henry 2d, the president of Clean Air Capital Markets, a small Washington-based investment banking firm that arranged the contract, said the contract was important because it was the first and because the price was low. "It sends a clear signal to the industry that allowances can be purchased below the cost of most scrubbers," he said.
Mr. Henry said scrubbers would become financially attractive on a wide basis if the cost of allowances rose to $300 to $350 a ton.
In addition, Mr. Henry said, buying allowances could be easier for utilities than relying on cleaner fuels that would have to be shipped from far away. A utility that bought allowances, he said, would often, in effect, be buying the benefit of the seller's having switched to cleaner fuels available locally.
But for the moment, the terms of this contract, which was signed on May 1, are not clear. Mr. Henry refused to discuss its terms, and neither would top officials of the two utilities. But William F. Malec, the senior vice president and chief financial officer of the T.V.A., said that a report in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that first disclosed the deal and said the price would be $250 to $300 a ton was "in the ballpark."
Such a price would be on the low end of what experts had expected. But Mr. Malec and Erroll B. Davis Jr., the chief executive of Wisconsin Power, pointedly refused to say when the money would be paid -- now, in 1995 or later. If it is not paid now, the cost of money would have to be figured in, and the value could be less.
When the Clean Air Act was signed by President Bush, some had estimated that a single allowance, or the right to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide, would be worth about $1,000 on the open market, but with improving technology for lowering such emissions, along with other factors, recent estimates have been lower.
If the cost of removing a ton of sulfur dioxide from the air is in fact lower than expected, that is good news for electricity users because it means the total cost of compliance with the Clean Air Act will be lower. But it may be bad news for companies that invested heavily in expensive pollution-control hardware, expecting to recoup the cost through sales of allowances.
The limits are set in terms of pounds of sulfur dioxide per unit of heat produced in utility boilers, keying them, in effect, to electricity production. The limit is set at one level from 1995 to 1999, and a stricter level beginning in 2000. In addition, new plants will have a limit of zero, meaning that for each ton of sulfur dioxide they produce, they must buy an allowance from the owner of an older plant who is willing, for a price, to clean up.
In the case of the deal to be announced today, Mr. Davis said, "these prices are going to come out eventually, as we go into regulatory proceedings." But his company does not want to divulge the number now, he said, because "we're hoping that the market is a bit more robust" and prices of allowances will rise.
Establishing the market price is important, according to another expert, Robert D. Conley, the president of Pure Air Inc. of Allentown, Pa., because utilities that are considering buying pollution allowances are weighing that option against installing pollution-control hardware or switching to lower-sulfur fuel, or both. Likewise, a company that is considering making the investment to "overcomply" wants to know what the allowances would sell for. If this deal and others that will presumably follow in coming weeks do not establish a price, then the industry will probably have to wait for an auction of extra allowances that the Environmental Protection Agency is planning to hold in early 1993.
Mr. Conley said that the T.V.A.-Wisconsin deal was probably small by the standards of those that will follow. Utilities typically need tens of thousands of tons of allowances, or more than 100,000, each year, he said.
 
A Geographic Shift
 The Clean Air Act is meant to cut acid emissions roughly in half, but the trading system also has the potential to shift the emissions geographically, if buyers are concentrated in one region and sellers in another. Mr. Henry, the investment banker, described the establishment of the trading system as "like a magic legal wand was waved, and all utilities in the country became one utility for purposes of acid rain control."
Most environmentalists consider acid rain a national problem, not a regional one, unlike, for example, smog, which is more local in nature. The emissions trading system was passed largely at the impetus of the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit environmental group.
Acid created in power plants can be deposited hundreds of miles from the source, with rain or snow. Some state regulators, however, have proposed limiting allowance trading to within their borders, instead of allowing utilities in their jurisdictions to clean up their stacks and sell the allowances to utilities upwind, with the resulting pollution coming back to the original state. But experts yesterday said no state had yet instituted such restrictions.
Mr. Malec and others involved in the deal said it should not be construed as the sale of the right to pollute. He stressed that the sum of emissions by the T.V.A. and by Wisconsin Power and Light would be equal to the total permitted by the new law. The 10,000 allowances, a small fraction of the reduction the T.V.A. will need, will give the authority some breathing room in case modifications to boilers or fuel switching arrangements are delayed, he said.
It is also a small fraction of the allowances that Wisconsin has available to sell. Under a state law, it has been held to stricter standards than those set by Washington, and passage of the act turned that "overcompliance" into a salable asset.
Generally, however, sellers have been held back in part because state regulators have not ruled on the question of who benefits from the proceeds, the stockholders or the electric customers. Thus, utilities have been reluctant to take the risk of investing in scrubbers or other equipment to create "overcompliance" because their shareholders might not benefit, and if the sale of the allowances does not recoup the costs, their shareholders might actually suffer.
Wisconsin regulators have not decided how the sale proceeds will be treated.

HEADLINE: Pessimism Is Overshadowing Hope In Effort to End Yugoslav Fighting

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 11

 BODY:
For many in the old city of Sarajevo, the legend spray-painted on a wall in a predominantly Muslim quarter expressed the agonies of civil war: "Welcome to hell."
For weeks, some of the deadliest weapons in modern warfare have been used against civilians across Bosnia and Herzegovina and its capital, Sarajevo. 
 Artillery, tanks, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, as well as Yugoslav-built fighter-bombers, have been used to blast lives and property in every corner of the former Yugoslav republic. Atrocities, including summary executions of civilians, have been commonplace.
 
570,000 Refugees
 Piecing together reports from cities, towns and villages too dangerous for most outsiders to visit, international relief agencies say hundreds of people have been killed and at least 570,000 -- more than one civilian in eight, in a total population of 4.3 million -- have been left homeless. The figures for the dead and homeless are little more than guesses, and many diplomats believe they are probably low.
What is clear is that a tragedy is unfolding on a scale with few precedents in Europe since World War II, and that efforts to end it, or even to mitigate its scale, have failed.
 
28 Killed in Sarajevo
 Today, at least 28 more people were killed in a Yugoslav Army artillery and mortar barrage on Sarajevo. In Brussels, the Foreign Ministers of the 12-nation European Community announced the withdrawal of their Ambassadors from the truncated Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro, identified by the United States and the European Community as the main aggressor in Bosnia. [Page A10.]
Under threat of additional but unspecified economic sanctions, the European ministers also demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Bosnia, or its "dismantling." The wording was intended to discourage a process Serbia initiated after earlier demands for the army's withdrawal, the transfer of as many as 80 per cent of the army's troops, amounting to about 30,000 men, along with much of their equipment, to irregular Serbian units that have been fighting alongside the army.
But with one Bosnian cease-fire after another having been violated almost as soon as it has been proclaimed, Western diplomats in Belgrade, the Serbian and Yugoslav capital, say there may be no end to the fighting until the rival sides -- Serbs, Croats and Muslim Slavs -- exhaust themselves.
By then, the diplomats say, there may be no Bosnia and Herzegovina left to save, and the independent state proclaimed in Sarajevo in March, and recognized by the United States and the European Community in early April, may become little more than a footnote in the turbulent history of the Balkans.
 
Goal of Serbs and Croats
 Last week, at a meeting in Graz, Austria, leaders of the republic's Serbian and Croatian groups announced that they had agreed to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina. This brought them closer to what has long been seen as their objective: annexation of their respective enclaves to Serbia and Croatia.
The biggest losers in the arrangement would be the Muslim Slavs, who make up the largest group in the republic with almost half of the population. For them, partition would mean retreating into small, dispersed enclaves that would have little hope of coalescing into a viable independent state.
For the United States and the European Community, the situation represents a major diplomatic setback, since Bosnia is the archetype of the post-Communist, multi-ethnic nations that range all across eastern Europe and eastward to the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union.
For Bosnia, disintegration would mark the tearing of a social and political fabric developed over a millennium. Since the Slavic peoples now known as Serbs and Croats settled in the mountainous regions inland of the Adriatic Sea in the seventh century, Bosnia has developed into one of the most intricate societies in Europe.
Serbs, who are mostly Orthodox Christians, and Croats, who are mostly Roman Catholics, live intermingled with the third Slav group, Muslims who adopted their faith from Turkish conquerors in the 15th century.
Despite a violent history that included mass deportations of Serbs during World War II, when many died in the death camps run by Croatia's fascist government, Bosnia lived for most of the 45 years after the war, the period of Communist rule, in relative harmony.
 
Serbs Opposed Independence
 But a February referendum on independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina, although approved by 99 percent of the vote, reflected only the preferences of the republic's Croats, accounting for 17 percent of the population, and the Muslim Slavs, representing 44 percent.
Serbs, 31 percent of the population, boycotted the vote. When the Sarajevo Government declared independence anyway, the Serbs asserted that they were being railroaded into a new state without any guarantee that their minority rights would be protected.
While continuing to negotiate the structure of an independent Bosnia in talks sponsored by the European Community, the Serbs shifted in early April to a military offensive that took on the character of a land grab.
As he did during the fighting in Croatia, in which a similar aggregation of Serbian forces seized one-third of Croatia, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia offered a host of undertakings intended to head off sanctions threatened by Western governments angered by the offensive.
 
Denying Territorial Claims
 For one thing, Serbia proclaimed the founding of a truncated Yugoslavia, restricted to Serbia and Montenegro, and declared that the new state had no territorial claims on its neighbors. For another, Mr. Milosevic insisted publicly that neither the Yugoslav Army nor Serbia-based paramilitary groups had played any role in the fighting.
Last week, the Belgrade leadership announced that all officers and troops in Bosnia who are not Bosnians -- about 20 percent of the total, according to the army -- would be withdrawn from the republic by May 19.
But the announcement said the role of all other army personnel in Bosnia would be settled in negotiations among the republic's three ethnic groups. In recent days, as convoys of troops and equipment have begun heading out of Bosnia to Serbia, the remaining troops, almost all of them Serbs, have begin preparing to merge with irregular Serbian units.
Already, the army and Serbian irregulars have gained effective control of at least 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including towns and villages in the north, east and south where Muslim Slavs or Croats, or both, have traditionally outnumbered Serbs.
 
Offensive in East Bosnia
 The offensive has covered a broad swath of eastern Bosnia, capturing towns like Bijeljina, Zvornik, Bratunac, Visegrad, Gorazde and Foca. Another major target has been the southern city of Mostar, the hub of the Herzegovina region and traditionally a stronghold of Muslim Slavs and Croats. In the north, the offensive has concentrated on opening a corridor to Serb-held regions of Croatia captured during last year's fighting.
A Croatian counteroffensive, particularly in northern and northwestern Bosnia, and in southwestern regions adjacent to the finger of Croatia that extends down the Dalmatian coast, has been strongly supported by Croatia, which has dispatched troops to join in the fighting.
Still, in Western embassies in Belgrade, the main responsibility for the war is pinned firmly on Serbia, and on Bosnian Serbs. Military attaches say that the offensives have followed a similar pattern to the fighting in Croatia last year, with the army giving close support to the Serbian irregulars.
Terror tactics have played a major part. Western diplomats and international relief officials, citing interviews with refugees and reports from United Nations and European Community military observers in Bosnia, say Serbian irregulars have entered towns and villages with Muslim Slav and Croatian populations, ordered all non-Serbs to leave at gunpoint, and executed some who have resisted. Homes have been looted and burned, and Serbian irregulars have hijacked trucks carrying United Nations food to Sarajevo.
If a settlement makes Muslim Slavs the main losers in Bosnia, the outcome is likely to be seen in the Muslim world as a suppression of the largest indigenous Muslim population in Europe, outside the one in Albania.
As one Arab envoy here put it: "These are people who represent the largest group in a country whose independence has been recognized by the United States and the European Community. But they are Muslims, and their rights are being trampled on by people who are Christians, so the United States and Europe make a lot of noise, but they do nothing."

HEADLINE: GRADUATES FACING WORST PROSPECTS IN LAST 2 DECADES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
When bands stop playing at college graduation ceremonies this spring, members of the class of '92, who came of age in a recession, will doff caps and gowns and enter one of the toughest job markets that any class has seen in decades.
Studies by two universities indicate that nearly one-third of the nation's entry-level jobs for new graduates have evaporated during the recession as many large employers have reduced their hiring. At the same time, the market is already glutted with nearly a million unemployed managers and professional workers. 
 Labor experts say the job market is the worst it has been in 50 years in the New York region. And it is not much better in the rest of the Northeast, California and Michigan. Elsewhere, particularly in the West, graduates are not having as hard of a time because either there has been no decline in jobs, or some growth in them. And nationally, the job market is expected to begin growing, though only slightly, over the next year.
 
Better Prepared for Job Search
 The class of '92 has been hearing about the dismal job market for three years, and, college placement officials say, its members seem better prepared for a grueling job search than the last two classes.
"Everyone knows it's a bad year, and everyone is working harder to find a job," said Jennifer A. Atkisson, a business major at Florida State College in Tallahassee who has interviewed at 15 companies without receiving an offer.
Hector Castillo, who is graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., said, "I am pretty marketable, but the job market is very small." Mr. Castillo, who majored in economics and Latin American studies, has been hunting for a marketing job in between his studies and a part-time job since November. "I am starting to dig a lot deeper, into alumni connections and things like that," he said.
 
Reduced Recruiting
 Liberal arts students have the toughest scramble ahead, while engineers and students with other technical degrees can expect a choice of jobs. And many graduates will try to skip the recession entirely, as shown by a substantial increase since last year in applications to graduate schools, especially law, business and journalism schools, and to not-for-profit or volunteer organizations.
Many companies have sharply reduced recruiting on campus. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, for example, recruited on 300 campuses in 1988 and hired 2,000 graduates. Gail Hiering Varma, the company's manager of college recruiting, said the company has reduced its hiring since then. This year, she said, the company recruited on 155 campuses and hired about 1,000 graduates.
But some companies, like the Procter & Gamble Company, have maintained their campus recruiting programs. The company hired more than 1,000 graduates this year, about the same number as it hired last year, said Linda Ulrey, a company spokeswoman.
Campus officials said the overall drop in recruitment combined with the anxiety caused by an eroding job market had noticeable effects.
College placement specialists at several Ivy League schools said that their graduates were adjusting well to the stagnant economy, but that more and more of them were heading for graduate schools. "I am concerned that students are making the graduate school decision by default and may end up in the wrong career," said Mary Giannini, executive director of the Center for Career Services at Columbia University in Manhattan.
At the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Patricia Rose, director of career planning and placement services, said she had found students to be much more serious about their preparations. "They have been scared into it," she said. "But last year we had fewer than 10 percent looking for work six months after graduation, and I don't expect any change this year."
 
100 Resumes, No Interview
 Liberal arts majors are the most fearful. Holly L. Young, an English major at Rice University in Houston, said she knew she was in trouble last summer when she sent out 100 resumes for an internship and did not get an interview. "I've been very nervous all senior year," she said. But she took career workshops at the placement office and narrowed her interests to consulting firms in business technology whose training programs she was interested in. After she had interviewed with more than 15 companies on campus this spring, Ernst & Young, one of the big accounting firms, recently offered her a $31,500-a-year job.
Two university studies suggest that the number of job openings for 1992 graduates has decreased by only 4 percent to 10 percent, but that decline comes on top of two previous annual declines that have, all together, eliminated almost a third of all entry-level positions since the 1989-90 school year. "We have a big pool of talent built up behind this recessionary dam, and it keeps getting bigger and bigger," said Victor R. Lindquist, a dean at Northwestern.
He is also the author of the university's Lindquist-Endicott Report, which has surveyed mid- to large-size businesses about their hiring plans every year since 1945. Nearly half of the 259 businesses surveyed this year said they planned to hire fewer new college graduates. "This is worse than anything I've seen in 20 years," Mr. Lindquist said. One bright spot in the survey: average salaries are up by a modest 2.7 percent over last year.
A Michigan State University survey of 464 employers in business, industry and government came to the same dismal conclusion as the Northwestern study. "This is the most serious cutback in the job market since we began surveying employers 21 years ago," said L. Patrick Scheetz, author of the survey and director of the Collegiate Employment Research Institute at Michigan State.
 
Reality Still Shocking
 The Michigan State study found that about 45 percent of this year's 1.1 million graduates -- the largest class ever to graduate from American colleges -- are in technical fields, like engineering and the health professions, that have more job openings than candidates. Another 13 percent of the graduates are heading for occupations like education and communication technology that have a balanced supply of jobs and candidates. And 42 percent of the graduates have degrees in areas like the social sciences and communications that are oversupplied with candidates.
Even though this year's graduates are prepared for a tough job search, the reality can still be shocking. "They tell you to start at the bottom, but even the bottom doesn't have much to offer," said Kristan Ginther, a would-be journalist who is graduating from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Several graduate schools of journalism, havens in the storm, report that applications are up 25 to 75 percent.
What makes the job search more difficult for the class of '92 is that its members are competing with 933,000 unemployed managers and professionals, whose jobless rate has increased by 60 percent in two years, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York.
"There have been no employment declines in some states in the West, Southwest and South," he said. "But I would say college graduates are facing the toughest job market in a half-century in the New York region. The whole Northeast, Michigan and California are severely affected."
Economists say they expect the job market to improve slowly. Sara L. Johnson, the managing economist for the DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting and forecasting concern in Boston, said the strongest employment growth over the next 12 months will be in the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest, dominated by Texas. "The Northeast will be lagging," she said, "but other parts of the country should see employment gains of 2 percent over the next 12 months."
To some students, the tough market means living at home after college. "I'm going to live at home for at least another two or three years," said Lisa A. Blessing, an economics major at Rutgers University who expects a long search for a job with a modest salary.
For other graduates, the solution is to leave the country.
Maria L. Recchia, a zoology major at Connecticut College in New London, wants work at La Stazione Zoologica, a marine biology laboratory in Naples, Italy. She is waiting to hear if the Government-subsidized laboratory has a research position for her. "I have no idea about the salary," she said. "I just hope it's enough to live on."
The Peace Corps reports receiving 800 telephone inquiries a day on average, up from 250 a day prior to January. But even the Peace Corps does not have many openings for graduates without technical training. "We can place graduates with degrees in agriculture or forestry within three months, but it takes up to one or two years to place a liberal arts graduate," said Elaine L. Chao, director of the Peace Corps.
Some volunteers sound more pragmatic than idealistic. Sarah Welling hoff, a major in international relations at the University of Nevada in Reno, is heading off to teach English in the African country of Chad. "If there were more jobs available or teaching assistantships for grad school," she said, "I might not have signed up."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Hope and Fear in Los Angeles As Deadly Gangs Call Truce

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 11

 BODY:
When one of his brothers was thrown through a plate-glass window during the riots here and another was shot, Reggie Harris barely flinched.
Having spent most of his 22 years in street gangs, he has seen a civil war's worth of suffering. Violence in the streets seems commonplace and permanent to him. 
 What really stunned him, he said, was when he walked into a gymnasium in enemy territory a few days after the riots and saw members of the city's rival gangs, the Bloods and the Crips, talking and playing basketball like brothers.
 
'Like a Big Family'
 "It was cool," he said the other day. "I never thought I'd ever see anything like that: Crips and Bloods getting along like a big family at Thanksgiving."
A lot of people around Los Angeles are surprised to see signs of accord between the two dangerous gangs, whose members have been sworn enemies for more than two decades.
Because the truce roughly coincided with the April 29 acquittal of four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist, Rodney G. King, rumors are circulating that it was called so that the Bloods and Crips could join forces against their mutual foe, the Los Angeles Police Department. It is not hard to find police officers who believe this.
But community social workers, police specialists on gang crime and several gang members themselves say they are skeptical that any organized violence against the police is planned. The truce itself has also drawn skepticism, because previous cease-fires have proved short-lived.
The very nature of the Crips and Bloods makes it hard for them to reach such a deal, these experts say. The gangs are not tightly structured, hierarchical organizations, but loose confederations of small neighborhood gangs whose many leaders often act independently of one another.
"The truce ain't everywhere in the city," said Robert Horton, 17, a member of the Athens Park Boys, one of the many subgroups that make up the Bloods. "And it ain't going to last. Maybe a month."
"I hope it does, but it probably won't," said his friend, LaVelle Hayes, 18. Gang violence "has been going on too long," he added. "People's brothers been killed, their mothers, fathers. There are too many grudges."
But during the rioting, a truce of sorts was evident to people who saw Bloods and Crips looting together.
As the members of the Athens Park Boys talked, they constantly watched the passing cars for any sign of a drive-by attack, the most common method of gang retaliation. Mr. Hayes noted that he was still recovering from a gunshot wound from a gang affiliated with the Crips.
And yet, even today there were signs that the peace movement was gathering momentum.
Late today, Charles Norman, the regional director of Community Youth Gang Services, said the truce was spreading across the city.
"It seems solid," he said, adding that Sunday night about 1,600 Bloods and Crips peacefully met at a housing project. "Even the young guys, the ones who might be hardheaded, are being cool. I guess they got a look at what's happening."
Mr. Norman said one member of the Crips said that he had not seen his relatives for 20 years because they lived in a Blood neighborhood. But because of the truce, Mr. Norman said, the man and his relatives "had dinner together for the first time in 20 years."
"They were hugging and crying," Mr. Norman said. "It took the Watts riots to start the gangs. It took another riot to get them to see that they're all in this together."
 
More Than Colors?
 For all the enmity that has existed between the two gangs, an outsider cannot easily tell much difference between them -- except their colors. The Bloods wear red and the Crips wear blue.
Wearing the wrong color in the wrong neighborhood has caused many killings. But during this uncertain truce, Mr. Harris said he saw gang members at the gym with a blue rag hanging from one pocket and a red dangling from the other in a gesture of unity.
The gangs are rooted in the impoverished neighborhoods scattered throughout the South-Central area, other parts of Los Angeles and other cities including Kansas City, Seattle and Phoenix. Their members include all races.
The Crips were established in 1968 and the Bloods were born within the next year. There are no initiation rituals. But some groups within the gangs may require new members to run a gantlet of fist-swinging members, but even this routine is not followed by all Crips and Bloods.
The gangs have a strong grip on the city's imagination, from the studios of Hollywood to the halls of government, especially around election time. Separating fact from myth about their numbers and their influence is often as hard as grabbing a handful of smoke.
 
Riot 'Not a Gang Thing'
 But their grip is also real and dangerous, particularly in struggling inner-city neighborhoods. In Los Angeles County last year, 775 people were killed in gang-related violence. And now investigators are trying to determine exactly what role the street gangs played in the rioting.
That may never be completely known. But Steve Valdivia, executive director of Community Youth Gang Services, said that about a fourth of the area's gang members participated in the South-Central rioting.
"The riot was not a gang thing," he said, adding that most gang members raging through the streets were merely part of an angry mosaic of black, white and Hispanic people who also included residents with 9-to-5 jobs and mothers and their children.
John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League, said too much attention had already been spent contemplating the gangs' role in the rioting. He said that focusing on the gangs obscured the riot's underlying causes: unemployment, poverty and racism.
 
Movement Toward Peace
 Mr. Valdivia said that many informal truce agreements have been reached among many of the gangs but he did not believe it was accompanied by a plan to kill police officers.
Rather, he said, "The gangs are starting to come to the realization that they're all the same, and that it doesn't make sense to be killing your mirror image."
Ed Turley, a field coordinator for Community Youth Gang Services in South-Central Los Angeles, said peace efforts had been in the works months before the officers were acquitted.
"But when the verdict came in," Mr. Turley said, "it was like a 10.0 earthquake that woke everyone up, especially gang members, to the injustice that is happening to minorities. The verdict helped push the process together. The across-the-board not-guilty verdict was a real slap in the face, whether you're a gang member or Joe Citizen."
He quickly added that the truce was an attempt to stop the senseless gang-related violence and not a call to arms against the police. He said there was no evidence that the gangs wanted to take on the police, whom many of the gang members see as simply another, well-armed gang.
"We don't respect them," Mr. Harris, a former member of the Crips, said of the police. "Why should we? They're always taking brothers to Bloods neighborhoods and leaving them to get messed up."
Glenn Newton, a 44-year-old manager of a roller skating rink, lives in South-Central Los Angeles near a wall where anti-police graffiti were scrawled. A week later, the graffiti were covered with fresh paint. "They may have painted it over, but it ain't over with," he said.
"This is just the beginning. This is a civil war that's going to go in and out."
That is what Officer Kevin Robinson and his colleagues at the 77th Division in South-Central Los Angeles are worried about.
Mr. Robinson, who grew up in the area and still lives there, said the police have been the targets of threats and sniper fire since the riots, but it was unclear whether the gangs were responsible.
The officer said the gangs had been talking of uniting for years and recently some of the gang members have become more politicized, wearing Malcolm X hats in their traditional gang colors of blue or red.
"A lot of people are fed up, and they feel that the Malcolm X theory of 'By Any Means Necessary' is the route to take," he said. "They're still fighting for their race. They want to pull together and fight this one battle."
Several current and former gang members and community advocates who work with them said the talk of waging war against the police is not serious and has little to do with the truce.
"They got tired of burying their dead," Mr. Turley said.
Leon Watkins, who operates a counseling service for gang members and their families, said there was no time to wait for the government to stir itself to action.
"We can't continue looking at rebuilding the buildings," he said. "What about the people? What a lot of these guys need is a break and a job."
So he is helping a group of former gang members who are trying to start a small T-shirt business. They call their product "Bone Out" street wear. "Bone out" is an expression used on the street to mean "run away." Gang members shout it out at times of danger.
"We want the kids to 'bone out' from the gangs," he said. "But they can't do it all by themselves. They need some help. This truce could be a peaceful situation or it could be business as usual after a few days. It's up to us, the adults."
Many gang experts, including Michael Genelin, head of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's hard-core gang unit, find it hard to imagine that the truce will spread throughout the 1,000 or more affiliates of the gangs, or that it will last.
"But even if the truce lasts a little while, it's worthwhile," he said, "because during that time someone isn't getting shot or killed."

HEADLINE: Bush and Congress Facing a Showdown on Forests

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Galvanized by a classic conflict between jobs and the preservation of the Pacific Northwest's virgin timber and the home it provides wildlife, the Bush Administration and Democrats in Congress are heading for a showdown that could test the influence of a growing anti-environmental backlash.
At issue are unlogged forests in Northern California, Oregon and Washington. Even as a Cabinet-level committee votes this week on how much forest should be cut, two committees of the House are set to deal with proposals that would protect endangered species by identifying and preserving ranges covering millions of acres. 
 The competing ideas reflect radically different views of the value of saving untouched areas. They also represent the start of a high-stakes battle over the 19-year-old Endangered Species Act, the strongest legal tool for preserving wild areas.
In response to environmentalists' pressure, the Department of Interior in 1989 designated the northern spotted owl a threatened species across its range of temperate rain forests in the Pacific Northwest. The law required the Government to develop a plan to safeguard the owl by identifying and preserving the areas where it lives.
 
Outcry in Communities
 But environmentalists said the Administration was ignoring that requirement. They brought three lawsuits that resulted in court orders temporarily setting aside almost eight million acres of timberland from clear cutting, a process in which the land is cleared of every tree, the brush burned and the ground replanted.
The result was an outcry in dozens of communities that rely on timber. "The Endangered Species Act leaves economic consideration, human considerations, jobs and common sense out of the loop," said Bill Moshofsky, a vice president of Oregonians in Action, a statewide group that is seeking to rewrite environmental laws. "The sense people have here is that this was a manufactured crisis in order for the preservationists to achieve their objective, which was to stop harvesting trees."
On Thursday, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is to deliver the long-awaited plan for preserving the owl, but the chances of its being put into effect are slim.
The reason, White House aides say, is that the Administration is intent on using the timber struggle to loosen the Endangered Species Act, which it says restricts economic development and intrudes on the lives of citizens. Saying that he wanted to bypass the law, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. cast the struggle in the Northwest as one that put a few little owls in the path of thousands of jobs.
In the last year, Mr. Lujan convened a Cabinet-level group, known as the God Squad, to decide how much timber should be cut on 44 tracts of Federal timberland in Oregon that otherwise would be virtually off limits under the Endangered Species Act.
Mr. Lujan also called on aides to develop a separate plan for cutting the forests that would waive many of the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. The proposal is likely to be introduced as legislation by Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington. The Cabinet vote and the public disclosure of the Administration's forest plan are also scheduled for Thursday.
"This Administration is not going to stand by and have 32,000 people lose their jobs," said Steve Goldstein, the chief spokesman for the Interior Department. "At some point Congress has to step up to the plate and determine whether the loss of 32,000 jobs is too high a price."
Democrats in Congress would take a much different approach. Both bills now in the House would slow the harvest of ancient timber and make available millions of dollars for retraining workers and restoring lands ruined by clear cutting. The issue, Democrats say, is not jobs versus owls but finding a new way to prevent plants and animals from going extinct by protecting the areas in which they live.
"My view is that the Administration has politicized the process and trivialized the Endangered Species Act by talking about one animal at a time," said Representative Bruce F. Vento, a Minnesota Democrat who is a co-sponsor of one of the House proposals.
Mr. Vento's proposal, which he developed with Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Interior Committee, would set aside roughly eight million acres of land to remain uncut, and put one million acres out of reach of loggers temporarily for research.
In addition, the bill would provide millions of dollars to timber communities for replanting the forest and restoring streams and slopes scarred by clear cutting. A separate proposal approved by a House Agriculture subcommittee would preserve fewer acres.
Both bills are to be considered by the full Interior and Agriculture committees soon.

HEADLINE: Judge Finds Driver Union In Contempt

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
A Federal judge ruled last night that a newspaper truck-drivers' union was in contempt of court for disrupting circulation of The New York Times in a labor dispute involving the newspaper, the union and a wholesale delivery operation. He ordered the union to pay The Times $100,000 for every hour of further disruption of the newspaper's weekday and Saturday deliveries and $500,000 for every hour of disruption of the paper's Sunday delivery.
The judge's ruling came on a day in which action on many fronts significantly intensified the union's six-day-old labor dispute with the wholesaler, Imperial Delivery Service, and The Times. Arthur E. Imperatore, who owns Imperial, said one of his employees had been kidnapped and threatened with death. 
 Union and company officials said that a meeting of the membership of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity this afternoon would be pivotal in trying to resolve the dispute.
 
Meeting This Afternoon
 The Allied Printing Trades Council, which includes all the unions working at The Times, The Daily News and The New York Post, invited representatives of Imperial and The Times to meet with it this morning. But both The Times and Imperial declined on the grounds that such a meeting would serve no purpose, and their refusal focused importance on the drivers' union meeting this afternoon.
In a ruling issued at 10:12 P.M. yesterday, Judge Pierre N. Leval of Federal District Court found the union in contempt of a temporary restraining order that he had granted on Thursday. Earlier in the day, he had extended the order through May 22.
In addition to asking for fines for further damage, The Times had also asked for restitution to compensate for losses of more than $2 million that had already been incurred because of delivery disruptions. The judge agreed last night to grant compensatory damages, but did not specify the award, pending the receipt of further documents from the newspaper. In documents filed with Judge Leval, The Times had cited a burned truck, punctured brake lines of four trucks, two bomb threats, stink bombs planted at printing plants, punctured tires and other incidents that it said violated the order.
In issuing his decision, Judge Leval criticized the union leadership for making only "token" efforts to ensure that union members obeyed the restraining order. "Virtually no effort was made to induce picketing members to allow deliveries to take place," the judge wrote in his seven-page decision. "No efforts were made to enforce union discipline against violators."
Michael J. Kurtz, the vice president for human resources at The Times, applauded the judge's ruling last night, saying he hoped the union would take the fines more seriously than it had taken the temporary restraining order. "It puts the entire union treasury at stake," he said.
George McDonald, the president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, agreed that the fines, if imposed, would be costly. "I don't think they have $100,000 in the union treasury," Mr. McDonald said. "The fines that the judge put down are awfully heavy. I think they are ridiculous."
On what was described as the kidnapping of an Imperial employee, Mr. Imperatore, the owner of the wholesaler, said at a news conference yesterday that one of his foremen was abducted at gunpoint, roughed up and held for 12 hours before being released.
Shaking with rage, Mr. Imperatore denounced the unknown men he said abducted the foreman, Munir Fahreddine, as "gangsters and terrorists" who were "using labor to justify extortion, blackmail and violence." He offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the kidnappers.
Douglas LaChance, president of the union, "totally disavowed" the kidnapping. "If a radical fringe did it, they did a disservice to the union, the union's unemployed members and the labor movement," he said. But he characterized Mr. Fahreddine as "a turncoat" who had been a union member until switching to a management position for Imperial just before the labor dispute began last week.
At his news conference, Mr. Imperatore seemed to rule out any accommodation with the union because of what had happened to his foreman. "I won't hire hoodlums and gangsters," he said. Asked if he was referring to the entire union, Mr. Imperatore said, "I'm talking about the hoodlums, gangsters and terrorists, and I can't separate them out."
But despite Mr. Imperatore's comments, John M. O'Brien, a deputy general manager at The Times who is in charge of the negotiations, said late yesterday that The Times still believed the only solution to the labor dispute was for the union to pass the contracts it had previously rejected. Implicit in such a solution is that, should the contracts be approved, Imperial would rehire union members whose jobs were filled by new employees on Thursday.
 
Rehiring Is Critical
 Mr. O'Brien added, though, that "Anything The New York Times would consider would not in any way offend Mr. Imperatore; our interests are identical."
The issue of rehiring is critical because, should Imperial not offer to rehire the drivers, the prospects would dim for winning approval of other contracts covering The Times's new $450 million printing plant in Edison, N.J., and another wholesaler operation that may be acquired by The New York Times.
The drivers who lost their jobs were employees of Westfair Newspaper Distributors, located north of the city in New Rochelle, where Mr. Fahreddine works, and Newspaper Distributors Company, in East Farmingdale, L.I. Mr. Imperatore bought the two wholesalers in a transaction that did not include their existing contracts.
In February, The Times announced its intention to buy two other distributors, Newark Newsdealers Supply Company and Metropolitan News Company, which distribute The Times in New Jersey and New York City. The Times and Mr. Imperatore negotiated new contracts with the union in an effort to keep the old workers, but at a lower cost.
From The Times's perspective, the union negotiations were part of a broader effort to cut labor costs to justify its investment in the Edison printing plant. From the union's perspective, the strategy was to extract the best possible deal from The Times and Imperial in exchange for concessions in work rules and overtime.
The union's leaders had agreed to the contracts because the alternative was to lose jobs or live with work rules greatly altered by binding arbitration without the inducements included in the contracts.
But the contracts were subject to approval by the entire 2,900-member union, which includes groups working at The Times, The New York Post, The Daily News, The Newark Star-Ledger, the wholesalers and some other operations. Such unionwide voting is common among printing trade unions, but the procedure allows union members not directly involved to determine the fate of groups at individual operations.
Though the union's leadership endorsed the contracts, about 57 percent of the membership voted against them, and they remain intensely unpopular with many union members, who have called them attempts to break the union.
When the contracts were defeated, Imperial hired new drivers the following day to fill 220 jobs previously held by union members, prompting the union to picket the centers. Members of the same union drive Times trucks loaded with papers to the distribution centers, where they are delivered to newsstands and other outlets by the wholesaler.
The battle for popular support in the dispute mounted yesterday, as Mr. Imperatore purchased a full-page advertisement in The Times to defend his record as a longtime successful employer of union labor. Both Mr. Imperatore and The Times called news conferences to defend their positions.
Lance R. Primis, president of The Times, said that there was successful delivery yesterday of about 92 percent of the 227,000 papers intended for newsstands and residences in Fairfield County and Westchester County and Long Island. In comparison, about 30 percent of the 342,000 Sunday papers for the area reached their destination. But Mr. LaChance disputed the number, saying that copies of The Times were very hard to find Monday morning in the affected area.
The kidnapping incident seems to have escalated the violence level well beyond what union leaders said was understandable or forgivable in such a situation. Indeed, some union leaders said that the incident was so shocking that it could trigger a reconsideration of the contracts, as an alternative to a further potential escalation of violence, which could spread to other unions and widen the conflict dangerously.
Milt Ahlerich, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Connecticut office, said yesterday that the office, in New Haven, was conducting a "preliminary investigation to ascertain whether or not to initiate a full field investigation" under Federal kidnapping statutes. Mr. Ahlerich said in an interview that the decision on whether to proceed would be made quickly, possibly by today.
 
'Alleged Abduction'
 The police in Danbury, Conn., said only that they were investigating "an alleged abduction and assault" in which an unnamed complainant said he was abducted at gunpoint, forced to abandon his vehicle, forced into another vehicle and dropped later in Pawling, N.Y.
A lawyer for Mr. Imperatore, Jerold Glassman of Grotta, Glassman & Hoffman, yesterday made available a videotape that he said showed Mr. Fahreddine being interviewed by another lawyer of the firm at Mr. Fahreddine's Danbury home after his release and questioning by the Danbury police.
Mr. Fahreddine has an unlisted number and could not be reached directly. Mr. Glassman said Mr. Fahreddine was still too upset to be interviewed yesterday.
On the tape, Mr. Fahreddine appeared to have a bruise on his upper right forehead. He said he was stopped in his car about 6:45 P.M. Saturday near Route 7 when a gunman jumped in his car, stuck a .38 revolver in his stomach and made him drive a short distance to where he was forced into a dark gray Pathfinder van with three other men.
He said he was blindfolded and driven about an hour to a gravel road where he was taken out of the car, forced into a house or building told to take off his clothes and lie on a bedsheet. One of the men, he said, then started "bouncing" on his back, where he had suffered a job injury several months ago.
He said one of the men said, "You call the cops and we'll blow your head off." The man also threatened his children, Mr. Fahreddine said on the tape.
About eight hours later, he said he was told to dress, driven to route 22 near Pawling, and told to walk away across the highway where he telephoned the police from a Grand Union.

Chart: "The Issues: The Background of the Labor Dispute"
 
When the dispute began
 On Wednesday, the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity rejected contracts covering drivers for four wholesale newspaper delivery companies.
 
Who was involved
 Two of the companies are in the process of being acquired by The New York Times. They are Newark Newsdealers Supply Company and Metropolitan News Company, which deliver in New Jersey and New York City. Two were bought on Thrusday by Arthur E. Imperatore, a New Jersey trucking and real estate entrepreneur. They are Westfair Newspaper Distributors in New Rochelle and Newspaper Distributors Company in East Farmingdale.
 
How it occurred
Since labor contracts do not survive the sale of assets, the purchases, in effect, invalidated contracts with the former owner which would have expired in 1993. This greatly upset drivers. New contracts were agreed to last month by The Times, Mr. Imperatore and the union's president and executive committee.
 
What was in the contract
 The contracts would have given drivers job security at The Times and at the wholesale operations, increases in base pay, contributions to welfare and pension funds and severance bonuses but would have eliminated over-time - cutting the income of most drivers in half, to about $40,000 a year - and would have changed work rules.
 
What followed the rejection
 In response to the drivers' rejection of the contract, Mr. Imperatore on Thursday hired new workers at the New Rochelle and East Farmingdale wholesalers. The union then sent up picket lines and the scattered violence and delivery disruption began. (pg. B4)

HEADLINE: Universal Health Care Plan Is Goal of Law in Vermont

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BENNINGTON, Vt., May 11

 BODY:
Gov. Howard Dean, the only Governor who is a doctor, signed a law here today that sets in motion a plan to give Vermont universal health care by 1995.
The law is one of the more ambitious in a series of recent efforts by states to tackle the problems of runaway medical costs and the increasing numbers of uninsured. Oregon, Minnesota and Florida have also passed comprehensive health insurance plans, as states have begun to act in the absence of Federal initiatives. 
 The Vermont law creates a state agency, the Health Care Authority, that will have the power to bargain for health insurance for the state's residents, using what Governor Dean called "enormous leverage" to gain better coverage at lower rates.
 
Final Decisions in 1994
 The agency will draw up proposals on how to pay for universal health care by next year. And it will provide detailed studies to the Legislature on whether the state should rely on private insurance companies or should follow the example of Canada and insure itself. The Legislature must decide on the final shape of the new system in late 1994.
"This is an incredibly exciting moment that should make all Vermonters proud," said Governor Dean, who signed the bill in a ceremony at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center here.
The law was supported by both parties in the Legislature, as well as the Vermont Medical Society and some insurers, including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont. The support of Governor Dean, a moderate Democrat and a specialist in internal medicine, was considered critical to the law's passage, as his backing reassured the health care industry and other businesses worried about the practicality of a new system.
 
Too Much or Not Enough?
 Nonetheless, several insurance companies, fearing increased regulation and decreased profits, have threatened to leave the state.
And some Democrats here have criticized the law for not going far enough or moving soon enough. The law's only immediate impact, for example, will be to extend state-sponsored health insurance to all children in low-income families.
Senator Cheryl Rivers, a Democrat who sponsored a rival bill that would have gone into effect sooner and would have created a Canadian-style system with Vermont insuring itself, said: "This is only a small step forward. The main thing it does is postpone the major decisions for two years, when the costs will be even higher."
But Governor Dean and Republicans here opposed her plan -- called a "single-payer" scheme -- as too expensive.
"Their package would have cost $500 million in a state with a total budget of $1.3 billion," Governor Dean said. "They would have created an entitlement program we can't pay for. We've got to control costs first to get an effective health care plan."
In the end, the two sides negotiated a compromise, agreeing to have the new health care agency study the costs of both a single-payer and a multi-payer plan that included private insurance companies closely regulated by the state.
The centerpiece of the new law is the Health Care Authority, which will have three executives, all selected by Governor Dean. It will consolidate the functions of several overlapping state agencies, a duplication that the state estimates accounts for 15 to 17 percent of annual health care costs.
 
Financing the System
 The authority will study how much medical procedures cost in Vermont, and will eventually set a ceiling on the state's overall health-care budget, Governor Dean said. Vermonters will use common claim forms.
"The two broad aims are to guarantee access to all by limiting costs and to reallocate resources away from expensive procedures to emphasizing primary and preventive care," Governor Dean said in an interview. "We do twice as many high-tech procedures as many other countries but the results aren't any different."
The new law also aims to reduce the cost of malpractice insurance by setting up an arbitration panel before malpractice cases go to court. It bans "cherry picking," a practice in which some insurance companies offer coverage only to groups of people who are low risk. And it sets up a common health insurance purchasing pool for state employees, which can be joined later by other groups.
There will be two basic options of how to pay for the new system. In one, individuals and group plans would continue to make payments, to be channeled through the state system. Under the other, backed by Governor Dean, payments would be made by a state trust fund, supported by some combination of new taxes.
"We've got to divorce health insurance from the employer-employee relationship," the Governor said, calling that relationship an accident of history that has created inequality and made reform difficult.
If health insurance is not separated from employment, he said, "we're going to continue to have problems with unemployed people, with people who change jobs" and with people who work for small employers that do not provide insurance.
 
Other States' Plans
 Among other states that have expanded access to health insurance, Hawaii has the oldest and the most comprehensive laws, requiring employers to pay for insurance premiums for any employee working more than 20 hours a week.
Most recently, Minnesota enacted legislation that would, among other things, provide health insurance to the uninsured by taxing hospitals, doctors, and other health care businesses.
Under a bill passed in March, insurers in Florida have two years to demonstrate they can come up with health care packages that most employers can afford; after that, mandates are recommended to the legislature.
Oregon is awaiting approval from the Federal Government for its plan to insure under its Medicaid program all families living at or below the poverty level. The Oregon law would also force employers of three or more people to provide health insurance or pay into an insurance fund by July 1995.
In Massachusetts, the Legislature pushed back, to 1995, the deadline for a similar proposal requiring employers of six or more to provide health insurance.

Study Says Big Cities Don't Get Fair Share of Military Spending

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
A study made public today says most of the nation's major cities are paying out far more in taxes for the Pentagon than they receive in military spending, contributing to their severe financial problems.
The Boston Redevelopment Authority study, done by Employment Research Associates, an economic consulting firm based in Lansing, Mich., found that in 1990, New York City experienced a net loss of $8.38 billion to the Pentagon, Los Angeles a loss of $3.27 billion, and Chicago a loss of $3.1 billion. In each of those cities, according to the study, the loss to military spending came to $3,000 or more per family. 
 "The riots in Los Angeles show what happens when billions of tax dollars are annually drained from a city," said Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, who is president of the United States Conference of Mayors.
The study said that 19 of the nation's 25 largest cities paid out more to the Pentagon than they received from military contracts, salaries and bases. Houston had a net loss of $1.77 billion, Phoenix of $1.08 billion and Boston of $682 million.
The study found that San Diego enjoyed a $3.97 billion net gain in military spending, and the District of Columbia had a $1.49 billion net gain. Seattle, New Orleans and Baltimore were among the cities that had a net gain.
"The military budget guarantees depletion and deprivation for large areas of our country," said James Anderson, an economics professor at Michigan State University who directed the study. He criticized the Pentagon as diverting money away from public and private investment, which he said does more than military spending to increase productivity.
According to the study, the net loss suffered by New York costs the city 250,000 permanent jobs, while the loss for Los Angeles and Chicago cost each of those cities 100,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Democrats Agree to Assist Bush On Investing in Poor Urban Areas

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Democratic Congressional leaders, who have long been unenthusiastic about urban enterprise zones, pledged today to work with President Bush to encourage investment in the impoverished inner cities.
The idea of enterprise zones, which has long been promoted by Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was embraced by President Bush in the aftermath of the recent riots in Los Angeles after he had given it only tepid support in the last three years. 
 Today, Democratic leaders in Congress made public a letter they had sent Mr. Bush telling him they planned to work with him to pass legislation for creating urban enterprise zones without delay.
"Americans need to know that their President and Congress, whatever their differences, can work together to meet urgent national needs," said the letter, which was signed by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader.
 
Criticism for Bush
 At the same time, Mr. Mitchell chided the President for vetoing a recent tax measure that was primarily intended to give relief to the middle class and that included incentives for business to invest in the inner cities.
And Mr. Gephardt criticized Mr. Bush for his record on domestic affairs, saying: "The President has pushed the snooze button on the domestic alarm clock long enough. Now he can afford to slumber no longer."
The Democratic leaders proposed that the plan for enterprise zones be considered separately from a tax bill.
Generally, the Democrats appeared to be striving for a conciliatory tone in preparation for a meeting with Mr. Bush and Republican Congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday, the first such meeting to discuss domestic policy this year.
In the letter, the Democrats commended Mr. Bush's tour of South-Central Los Angeles last week and proposed to cooperate because "no one benefits if differences of opinion paralyze our society's response."
The letter continued: "We believe incentives for economic growth and restoration; the urgent need to combat crime and random violence; and a deeper commitment by Government, business, and individuals to constructive, supportive family policy. All these constitute a common ground."
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, responded positively to the Democratic gesture as Mr. Bush toured an area in North Philadelphia that was once a thriving manufacturing district but now is home to a lively drug trade.
"We'll probably have a good debate over the methods and means, the tax rates and enterprise zones," Mr. Fitzwater said, "but these things can be worked out. We're willing to compromise."
The tour of the blighted area was added at the last minute. Mr. Bush had already planned the trip to Philadelphia, where tonight he attended a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner.
The Democratic leaders urged Mr. Bush to extend unemployment insurance to many thousands of workers who currently do not qualify, add to financing for a summer youth jobs program and revise his budget request to provide for $3.6 billion in additional public works projects under the 1991 transportation act.
The Democrats also called on Mr. Bush to back a Democratic-inspired crime bill, including extensions of gun control and the death penalty, that has been pending in the Senate for months because of threats of a Republican filibuster. The Republicans charge that the bill would allow endless appeals to death-row inmates.
Democratic Senate strategists are considering calling the Republicans' bluff and embarrassing Mr. Bush, by daring them to filibuster a bill that they contend would strengthen the hand of local police in stemming gang violence and drug offenses.

HEADLINE: Banks Aim To Block Fee Rise

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
On the eve of a pivotal regulatory vote for the banking industry, bankers and Bush Administration officials said today that they were close to victory in their drive to block any increase in the premiums banks pay to the deposit insurance fund.
Bank representatives who have met with the five members of the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in anticipation of Tuesday's decision said today that they had at least two votes to put off a premium increase and thought that they would be able to convince a swing vote. 
 The insurance fund says it has a deficit, and Congress and some regulators believe it must be buttressed with additional funds. But bankers argue that a premium increase will weaken their industry just as it has begun to recover, and the Administration says any premium increase will ripple through the economy and slow down growth.
 
Now 23 on Every $100
 Premium costs, now 23 cents for every $100 in deposits, are ultimately paid by stockholders, who will get lower returns if premiums are raised, and bank customers, who will pay higher fees and receive lower yields. They are also borne to some extent by taxpayers, since banks can write off a percentage of their premiums on their corporate taxes.
Besieged by intense lobbying from the industry and the Bush Administration, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which had said last year that it would consider an increase in 1992, decided last month to postpone any increase before Jan. 1. The vote on Tuesday will be on a proposal to raise premiums, probably by between 2 cents and 7 cents for every $100 in deposits, starting in 1993.
"It's a substantial money decision," said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association. "It will have an impact on banks' profitability, and it will have a macroeconomic impact."
The issue puts William Taylor, the head of the deposit insurer and chief proponent of an increase, in a difficult position. His term expires in February, and he faces the strongly conflicting crosscurrents of the Bush Administration, with its belief that an increase will dampen the economic recovery, and Congress, which has urged a premium increase to avoid an embarrassing repeat of the huge bailout of the savings industry.
The proposed increase would differ among institutions because the F.D.I.C. is expected to vote to phase out the flat rate in favor of a new fee structure that assesses each institution depending upon its financial health, with weaker banks paying more. The strongest institutions, which are generally smaller ones, would be expected to pay an increase of about 2 cents, while the weaker ones might end up paying an additional 7 cents.
An increase has been repeatedly demanded by Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, which will have to decide whether to confirm Mr. Taylor if he is nominated for a second term.
At the urging of the banks, the proposed premium increase has been just as staunchly opposed by Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson, who says the F.D.I.C. should wait until the end of the year to decide whether to increase premiums. He says the proposal is a threat to easier lending and a serious impediment to economic growth.
 
A Fundamental Disagreement
 The debate also reflects a fundamental disagreement between the banks and Mr. Taylor about the condition of both the industry and the bank insurance fund. Mr. Taylor has told associates that he is not firmly convinced that the worst is over for the banks. He says he believes that the insurance fund will once again lose more money this year than it receives in premiums and that if he errs, it should be on the side of reserving too much instead of not enough.
He has also said that the fund, with a deficit of $7 billion to $9 billion, is already dangerously undercapitalized and needs to be rebuilt as quickly as possible.
But bank lobbyists say that those figures already have reserves built into them for anticipated losses and that Mr. Taylor is unreasonably pessimistic about an industry that has begun to recover. They point to the fact that the agency has already seized far fewer institutions this year than it had predicted.
 
51 Banks Seized This Year
 Last year, Mr. Taylor said that 200 bank failures were expected in 1992 involving institutions that hold $86 billion in assets. So far this year, the F.D.I.C. has seized only 51 banks holding $16.1 billion.
"Taylor's crying wolf," said Bert Ely, a banking consultant who has been lobbying the deposit insurer for the industry. "He hasn't made the case. The losses aren't there and they don't need the money."
He added that a defeat for Mr. Taylor would be a serious setback for his ability to lead the agency.
"The chairman doesn't look very chairman-like and very powerful if he's losing votes," Mr. Ely said. "It does not enhance his stature."
Two of the board members -- T. Timothy Ryan Jr. and Stephen R. Steinbrink -- head agencies in the Treasury Department and are expected by the industry to support the Administration's view and reject an increase. Mr. Taylor is expected to have the support of C. C. Hope Jr., a former North Carolina banker. The swing vote of Andrew C. Hove Jr., the board's vice chairman, is unknown.
 
'A Compelling Argument'
 "The fund is still losing a lot of money, and that's a compelling argument to do something," Mr. Hove said in an interview this afternoon. "The decision is going to affect the costs to the entire industry. It affects the fund's viability, and the public's perception of it."
Board members including Mr. Taylor have said they have never faced more intense industry and political pressures than over the proposed rate increase.
"We get kind of passionate about this," said Thomas L. Ashley, a friend and adviser of President Bush and head of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, which represents many of the nation's largest institutions.
Mr. Ashley has met with most of the board members in recent days to tell them that he thinks the increase is unnecessary.
"The losses are not there," he said. "But the F.D.I.C. is acceding to the General Accounting Office's view that more reserves are needed, and the G.A.O. is reflecting the embarrassment of Congress from the thrift disaster.
"Taylor sees the world, as he should, as a regulator. He doesn't see the world in the broad economic terms of the economy and what's needed to promote and sustain a recovery."

HEADLINE: Thais Plan a Way to End Army Rule

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 11

 BODY:
A weeklong demonstration that has effectively paralyzed Thailand's military-dominated Government was suspended early this morning after opposition leaders said they would support an amendment to the Constitution to require the Prime Minister to be an elected member of Parliament.
Tens of thousands of students, workers and members of this rapidly developing country's prosperous new middle class have turned out to protest the appointment of a former commander of the armed forces, Suchinda Kraprayoon, to head the Government. The former general, who led a military coup last year, had not run in the March 22 parliamentary elections. 
 Early this morning, Chamlong Srimuang, who set off the mass demonstrations on May 3 by going on a hunger strike until the Prime Minister stepped down, called on his followers to go home but to return Sunday if the Suchinda Government does not live up to its commitment to constitutional changes.
 
King May Have Intervened
 Mr. Chamlong, also a former general, had ended his fast on Saturday, saying he was doing so in order to continue more effectively the struggle for democracy.
There have been widespread reports that Mr. Chamlong's decision followed a discreet intervention by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The revered ruler, whose influence reaches far beyond his limited political power, is said to have obtained agreement from Mr. Suchinda not to use force to disperse the demonstrators if Mr. Chamlong abandons his threat to commit slow public suicide.
The fast by Mr. Chamlong, who as Governor of Bangkok gained a reputation for austere honesty in a country that has long tolerated considerable corruption, had raised the political temperature to heights rarely experienced in this blase nation.
On Saturday, to the open disappointment of the students most committed to breaking the cycle of military intrusion into supposedly democratic politics, leaders of the five Government and four opposition parties agreed to put forward constitutional amendments that would enhance the power of elected officials. But Arthit Urairath, the Speaker of Parliament, rejected demands from many of the protesters that the governing parties commit themselves in writing not to oppose the amendments.
 
A Sign of Stubbornness
 Today, Mr. Suchinda reaffirmed his refusal to resign. In political circles it is assumed that Mr. Suchinda could comply with a constitutional change by obtaining a parliamentary seat in a district where support for him is strong.
The former commander, who pledged last year that the coup he led was not intended to make him leader of the Government, was appointed by the majority parties after a civilian candidate put forward by the governing coalition had to step down because of suspicions of drug-dealing. The news was leaked in Washington that his suspected involvement in narcotics would make him ineligible to visit the United States, Thailand's principal international supporter.
Despite today's agreement, the crisis appears far from resolved. A former member of Parliament, Chalard Worachat, went on a public hunger strike to demand Mr. Suchinda's resignation even before Mr. Chamlong did. He interrupted his fast earlier but returned to it when Mr. Chamlong announced his action. Today he said he would continue to his death unless Mr. Suchinda gave up.
Given the continuing tension, such a death, or any other major incident, could bring out masses of protesters even before Sunday and might provoke military action.
 
A New Pool of Protesters
 Television coverage has suffered from clear signs of military censorship, but the press, which has remained free throughout the dispute, has emphasized that no public support for the Prime Minister has been evident in response to the mass opposition.
Political commentators have described Mr. Suchinda as greatly weakened by the protests and unlikely to remain Prime Minister for long.
The presence among the demonstrators of middle-aged and young professionals, including Government officials, is a new element in Thai politics. Speculation centers on whether the growth of a politically active middle class, spawned by the rapid economic expansion in recent years, has now become a serious obstacle to the traditional role of the military as the ultimate arbiter of politics

HEADLINE: European Nations to Recall Envoys From Belgrade

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 11

 BODY:
Struggling to force Serbia to end its military attacks in the newly independent republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, European Community governments decided today to recall their ambassadors from Belgrade and seek the international isolation of what remains of Yugoslavia.
At a meeting in Brussels, community foreign ministers also backed United States efforts to have Serbia and Montenegro suspended from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and threatened to tighten existing economic sanctions against Belgrade into "a total embargo." 
 Coming 10 months after Western Europe first tried to broker a peace in Yugoslavia, however, today's meeting was dominated by the 12 nations' deep sense of frustration at their failure to curb military offensives by the Serb-dominated federal Yugoslav Army.
 
'Just Have to Persevere'
 "Cease-fires are negotiated and broken, agreements are negotiated and broken," Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said after the daylong meeting. "You just have to persevere."
In a statement, the 12 ministers said Belgrade's role in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where 1,300 people have died in fighting over the past six weeks, deserved "universal condemnation." They also described the Serbian forces as an army of occupation.
Among the former Yugoslav republics, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Croatia have won recognition from the European Community and the United States. Serbia and Montenegro have decided to remain united in a reduced Yugoslavia, although Serbia claims to represent Serbian minorities in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
The Question of Macedonia
 The sixth republic of the old Yugoslav federation, Macedonia, has also declared its independence, but Greece has so far blocked its recognition by the community, arguing that the republic's determination to be called Macedonia masks territorial ambitions over the adjacent Greek province of the same name.
Although Greece's community partners are growing impatient with its use of its veto, the foreign ministers today once again postponed recognizing Macedonia.
The foreign ministers also said they would seek to exclude Serbia and Montenegro from taking part in debates on the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 52-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is meeting in Helsinki, Finland.
The Helsinki European Conference normally works through consensus, permitting any single government to block decisions. To break this deadlock, a draft resolution calls for Belgrade's suspension from the Yugoslav debate until June 30, but this proposal has so far been blocked by Russia, which fears setting a precedent that could one day affect its own interests.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
No U.S. Move Announced
 WASHINGTON, May 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- The deputy State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said today that the United States had not had time to discuss with the European Community the decision to recall ambassadors from Yugoslavia.
Asked if the United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia was likely to be withdrawn, Mr. Boucher said that a number of options were available and that "I can't at this point really speculate on how quickly or when we might move on any specific one."

HEADLINE: A Downturn With a Difference

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 11

 BODY:
With Japanese economic growth slowing, Sadahiko Hidaka took a few minutes recently to tally the costs of the downturn on the metal fabrication company he heads.
He said he expected his company's sales to drop 20 percent this year from last year's $15 million, because of cutbacks by his customers, which are big manufacturers like auto, shipbuilding and weapons companies. 
 But, Mr. Hidaka said, he does not plan to lay off any of his 130 employees or to shut a plant.
The most visible sign of adjustment may be that Mr. Hidaka has decided not to replace his company's almost-new autos this year.
 
Not the Usual Symptoms
 The responses of companies like Mr. Hidaka's, a subcontractor at the core of Japan's industrial machine, make the looming economic downturn puzzling to many in the West, where a slumping economy is synonymous with unemployment, plant closings and cost controls.
But even if Japan's jobless rate does not rise much above its current level of 2.1 percent, a powerful sense of anxiety underlies the thinking of most business executives these days. Economists are warning that this could prove the deepest recession in several decades, particularly for Japan's manufacturing sector.
Perhaps worse, there are signs that companies like Mr. Hidaka's face a daunting test because their markets are not simply weak, but changing. The lack of unemployment is concealing an array of other problems, many experts are saying.
"The key thing to be watching is not whether there is unemployment, but whether people are cutting their expenditures," said Richard Koo, a senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute. "That is why we are getting more and more worried about where we are going. Some indicators may be holding up, but my feeling is that they are barely holding up."
For instance, though nobody is being laid off at the Hidaka Seiki Company, Mr. Hidaka's precision fabrication concern, all overtime has been stopped, which means workers are losing a significant portion of their income and spending power.
The company is also squeezing its own suppliers by placing fewer orders, another blow to wages and spending.
And, perhaps most important, the company cannot resort to its old cure-all -- an export drive -- to bolster sales. Weak markets overseas and heavy political pressure at home to ease tense trade relations with the United States have made it difficult for companies to unload their goods at cut-rate prices abroad. Japan's trade surplus is already headed for a record this year, of more than $125 billion, and the Government is urging companies to focus on imports to mitigate the problem.
 
New-Products Time
 The point, Mr. Hidaka said, is that he will have to steer his company in a new direction, looking for new markets and new products during the slowdown.
"We see this as a period of adjustment that is different from slowdowns we've experienced in the past," he said. "Every product has a life span, and so do industries. We don't think automobiles will be the leading industry forever. The only answer is to develop new products during this period. You have to be forward looking in this kind of time or you won't survive.
"In one way it is more serious because we can't see the future. If this does continue next year, then we will have an entirely new situation. We would have to start thinking about layoffs."
Of course, what Mr. Hidaka did not say, but what many in the West fear, is that if he and other Japanese manufacturers succeed, they may emerge from the grip of this slowdown even more competitive relative to their American counterparts.
Although the Government has not officially declared the economy in recession -- the definition is vague but it is usually growth of less than 3 percent a year -- the signs of a severe slowdown are everywhere, side by side with continuing signs of underlying strength, remnants of the five-year boom that left Japanese industry in a far more competitive position.
The economy shrank at an annualized rate of two-tenths of a percent in the last three months of 1991, and the signs are pointing to more contraction for a while.
Nonetheless, most economists are forecasting growth of around 2 percent for the entire year, a sharp slowdown from last year's 4.5 percent rate, but a respectable pace by American standards.
Department store sales fell 4.1 percent in March, the largest decline since the Japan Department Store Association began collecting the figures in 1965 (with the exception of March 1990, when there was an aberrational decline caused by the introduction of a new 3 percent sales tax the year before).
Yet there are about 125 job vacancies for every 100 people seeking jobs.
Housing starts fell 19.4 percent in the 1991 fiscal year, which ended March 31, the steepest decline in 17 years. Industrial production fell 2.8 percent in March from February, according to preliminary figures, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is predicting a further decline in April.
 
Pay Cuts for Executives

 
 Electronics companies have been at the forefront of reductions of top executives' salaries, and some securities companies have told their directors to take trains to work instead of company limousines. But still none have resorted to layoffs
Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd., a private credit agency, reported that there were 10,723 corporate bankruptcies last fiscal year involving debts of more than 10 million yen, or about $80,000. Those companies left behind total debts of about $61.3 billion, nearly twice the previous record for a year.
There is concern that these loan losses could so hurt Japanese banks that cash-starved companies will find it harder to get the capital they need to grow.
 
Loans Are Scarce

 
 Indeed, Mr. Hidaka said banks were willing to make loans to meet routine operating expenses, but that money for long-term expansion or improvement projects had already disappeared.
"An established company like ours can do all right," he said. "But smaller companies or new companies are in trouble."
Sales of new autos fell 4.8 percent in April from the year earlier, the 12th straight monthly decline. Even sales of imported autos, which are mostly European luxury cars, an increasingly popular status symbol here, have been falling.
In fact, a pattern is developing in which sales of the most luxurious products have been hit hardest, but the basics have been less affected.
Sachio Takamine, head of the large gourmet foods department at the Tobu department store, said he began to see signs of the slowdown last year. "The first indication we got was that party-related goods, such as expensive wines and pate, began to decline," Mr. Takamine said. "It was the more expensive items."
He and others said that sales of gift packages of food, which are very popular among corporate executives, had also declined as companies trimmed their expenses. But, he said, the Japanese are still enjoying their new sense of affluence, in spite of the slowdown, and are not giving up all luxuries. Sales of caviar, for instance, are still rising at his store, Mr. Takamine said, and overall sales of gourmet foods continue to grow.
 
Fewer Rolls-Royces
 On the other hand, Shin Watari, president of Cornes & Company, which imports and distributes Rolls-Royce autos here, said his business had been devastated.
Before the powerful economic boom of the late 1980's, he sold only 50 to 60 of the cars a year. With the soaring stock and real estate markets and the general expansion of the last five years, sales rocketed as high as 500 in 1990. But this year, he said, he expected sales of just 150 to 180 of the cars, which retail for more than $200,000 each.
"Until last August there was still a six-month waiting list for some models," Mr. Watari said. "Now I fear that things will continue to slow down. I don't think the environment will improve soon."
This patchwork of indicators is being read by industrial planners as a sign that eventually they will have to find new products. Toyota Motor, Japan's largest auto maker, is eliminating one of the two eight-hour shifts at a plant near Nagoya that produces luxury sedans. It is also reducing the blizzard of different models it has been offering and is contemplating slowing the development time of new models to cut costs.
"Until the 1980's, we could always resort to exports to jack up sales when times were tough," said Tsunehiko Fujii, assistant manager of Toyota's research division. "But now we are trying to moderate our exports. So we cannot find a simple means to get out of the current recession. The only way is through boosting domestic demand."
 
Strategy Not Working
 He added that Toyota had sought since last year to increase demand in Japan for recreational vehicles. "But most standard sedans are just not selling well," Mr. Fujii said. "It hasn't worked so far."
Hidaka Seiki faces a similar problem. Its business comes 60 percent from the auto industry, 20 percent from producing parts for merchant ship radar systems, and 20 percent from military-related products.
Not only is the auto industry suffering, but with the end of the cold war, Hidaka Seiki is facing up to the reality that its military contracting business will never grow as it did in the days of superpower confrontation.
From 1.073 trillion yen in the fiscal year that ended March 31, 1991, the Government's spending on new weapons is expected to decline to 865 billion yen in the current fiscal year, which ends next March 31.
"That is one reason why this time lowering prices does not really help," Mr. Hidaka said. "There just is no demand. The only way out in the long term is to develop new products. The old businesses just are not going to grow as fast as before."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bush Announces New Effort to Immunize Children

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
President Bush announced at a Rose Garden ceremony today that the Federal Government would begin a nationwide campaign to immunize children against preventable diseases by the age of 2.
Pediatricians and other public health experts said Mr. Bush's proposal was belated and inadequate. 
 Mr. Bush also announced a Federal program intended to reduce infant mortality by increasing the number of women who get prenatal care. This program is called Healthy Start, but Democrats derided it as a "late start," saying it was prompted more by the political calendar than by genuine interest in child health problems. The centerpiece of the program announced today is a 30-second television commercial saying, "Every 13 minutes another infant dies."
Today's announcements were part of Mr. Bush's effort to show an active interest in domestic social and economic problems. Democrats, including Gov. Bill Clinton, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, say Mr. Bush has neglected those problems since he took office.
 
Similar Ceremony Last Year
 Mr. Bush's announcements come 11 months after a similar Rose Garden ceremony in which he said he was sending senior officials to six cities to investigate why children were not being vaccinated against measles and other diseases.
In an interview, Dr. Samuel L. Katz, professor of pediatrics at Duke University and chairman of the Federal Immunization Practices Advisory Committee, said Administration officials "finked out and did not follow through after they had a big Rose Garden show" last year.
"Other than Haiti and Bolivia, we probably have the worst record in the Western Hemisphere of immunizing children in the first two years of life," said Dr. Katz, who was appointed to the advisory panel by Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
The Administration says the effort last year was "phenomenally successful," because it produced plans for immunizing children in the six cities: Dallas, Detroit, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego and Rapid City, S.D. But officials of the Public Health Service said they did not have data showing that the number of immunizations had actually increased in those cities.
Mr. Bush's new effort to underline his interest in domestic affairs forces him into a politically awkward position: He is choosing to emphasize the very problems his critics say he has ignored. Thus, for example, the Department of Health and Human Services today issued a statement saying, "The Bush Administration recognizes the under-immunization problem in our children from 2 months to 2 years."
In a separate statement, the department acknowledged that the infant mortality rate was higher in the United States than in 21 other industrial countries and that "the incidence of low birth weight is at the highest level observed" in this country since 1978. Low birth weight is the most important predictor of infant mortality. Babies weighing less than 5.5 pounds have a higher than average risk of dying in the first year of life.
The American Academy of Pediatrics welcomed Mr. Bush's proposals today, but said he was not providing enough money. For immunizations in the next fiscal year, Mr. Bush has requested $349 million, up from the $298 million appropriated for this year. But the academy said $489 million is needed.
Representative Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat who heads the Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, said: "I'm getting tired of the President mouthing his great concern for children, families and babies. He loves them to death up to the door of the budget office; then he drops them like a hot rock."
Under Mr. Bush's plan, four Cabinet departments will work together to get children immunized against diseases like polio, measles, mumps, rubella and hepatitis B. The four departments -- Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Education and Housing and Urban Development -- operate a range of health, welfare and nutrition programs.
"Thousands of our young children suffer crippling effects each year from measles and other communicable childhood diseases, and some even die," Mr. Bush said.
While the President is now declaring his commitment to child health, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said the Administration previously opposed efforts to require Medicaid coverage for all pregnant women and infants in families with income up to 85 percent over the official poverty level. (The poverty level for a family of three was $10,857 in 1991.)
In an interview, Mr. Waxman, who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and Environment, said: "Today's announcements show the President's business-as-usual approach to public health -- too little and too late. He proposes immunizations after a measles epidemic breaks out. He proposes tuberculosis services after TB has spread through our cities. Today's media blitz is no substitute for vaccines and nurses."
But Dr. Vincent A. Fulginiti, a pediatrician who serves as dean of the Tulane University School of Medicine, praised the steps announced today. The steps result from recommendations made in January 1991 by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, of which Dr. Fulginiti is chairman.
"We have four major Government departments that did not previously work together on immunization," Dr. Fulginiti said.

HEADLINE: Adirondacks Plan Offered by Assembly

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 11

 BODY:
The Assembly today renewed long-stalled efforts to strengthen protections for the Adirondack wilderness, offering a new package of economic enticements for local governments to go along with tougher zoning restrictions for many lakeside and forest areas.
The package, which comes in the six-million-acre park's centennial year, was a clear bid by the Democratic-led Assembly to make new park regulations more palatable to the Republican-controlled Senate. 
 The package proposed today by Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin and two other Assembly Democrats, Maurice Hinchey of Ulster County and Alexander B. Grannis of Manhattan, would significantly decrease the number of houses that could be built in many wilderness tracts and virtually forbid residential development in many of the back-country areas that are now held by timber companies.
For four years the Senate has resisted proposals intended to ward off development in the Adirondacks, arguing it could stifle the economy.

HEADLINE: MCI Planning More Growth

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
The MCI Communications Corporation, the nation's second-largest telecommunications company, said today that it planned to continue to grow in the United States market and capture a hefty slice of world business.
"We will be among the five or six truly global telecommunications companies," said Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's chief executive, at the 20th annual meeting of the company. 
 Its recent $250 million contract to provide long-distance telephone service for four years to Citicorp symbolizes its expansion into the financial market, he said.
Despite the sluggish economy last year, MCI maintained a 16 percent growth rate for traffic carried on its telephone lines, double the industry average. And its profits nearly doubled from 1990's weak level of $299 million, or $1.06 a share, to $551 million, or $2.01 a share, last year.
This year the company is predicting 10 to 15 percent profit growth. But some analysts worry that the price paid to achieve that growth is proving too high, shaving its margins too close. MCI's operating profit margins have slipped from 15.7 percent in the 1990 first quarter to 12.7 percent in the 1992 first quarter. William McGowan, MCI's chairman, said the company would pay close attention to costs.
MCI shares closed today at $32.50, down 12.5 cents, in over-the-counter trading.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Perot and Riots Redraw Bush Campaign Plans

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
It has been a turbulent year for the people whose job it is to get George Bush re-elected, not at all the kind of stately progress toward an emphatic November victory many of them had expected.
In late January and February, Patrick J. Buchanan was the nemesis. Then, gradually, Mr. Bush rallied and the troubles of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumptive Democratic nominee, accumulated on several fronts. Polls and politicians concluded that the President, for all his troubles, was a likely winner after all. 
 Now a third phase has begun, with twin threats to Mr. Bush's ambition to become only the third President since World War II to serve two full terms. With the primary elections coming to a close, quite successfuly from his standpoint, Mr. Bush's managers are struggling to come to grips with the putative third-party candidacy of Ross Perot and with the new politicial agenda generated by the arson and looting that swept Los Angeles 12 days ago.
While some people in the White House debate how sweeping a program Mr. Bush should offer to help cure the problems that underlay the rioting in California, some at campaign headquarters worry that the President may focus too closely on the question.
"What I want," said one of Mr. Bush's top strategists, "is a few more days of this -- a simple, clear program with three or points, then get off it. The longer the President seems preoccupied with Los Angeles, the more he and his urban policies become the issue, and that's not good for us."
But others involved in the campaign think it would be a major mistake for the President not to seem deeply involved in trying to alleviate the anxieties that have been stirred by the vivid events in Los Angeles.
To move on to other themes too quickly, a senior Republican operative insisted, "will make it look like we don't understand how deep all this runs -- not only the frustration of the blacks, which a lot of yuppies who voted for Bush sympathize with, but also the fears of the law-and-order voters, who also helped elect him four years ago." The problem, as he outlined it, is how to avoid letting the riots drive a wedge into the Bush constituency.
That may already have happened to some extent; private polls taken for both parties, as well as a few public polls, show Mr. Bush falling back in the wake of the riots.
But the Perot problem is no less severe, as seen from the Bush camp.
According to one campaign planner, the original intention had been to aim the Republican campaign mainly at the South, where Mr. Clinton was considered a threat in only two or three states on the periphery of the region, at the West, and at the industrial states of the Midwest, which were thought likely to be the main battleground. In the Northeast, only New York seemed likely to the Bush strategists to provide useful hunting grounds.
Now, the planner said, all that has been swept aside and "we're all looking for a new strategic concept that accounts for Perot's strength."
While Bush strategists, especially those from Texas, readily tell stories intended to point up Mr. Perot's alleged authoritarianism and shortness of temper, one who has known him for years said the other day, "He's a master salesman, remember, and he may cause us real trouble."
In an attempt to stop the erosion in Mr. Bush's support, the campaign is studying the possibility of running television commercials created by a new media team, which includes several Madison Avenue experts, well before the fall campaign. One plan would involve a heavy media expenditure before the California primary on June 2, even though Mr. Buchanan is considered more a bother than a threat there; another would schedule Bush ads before, during and after the Democratic National Convention in New York this summer, in an effort to deny most of the usual convention-week lift to Mr. Clinton.
All of these discussions are taking place against a backdrop of considerable personal animosity and organizational confusion. Tensions among some of the principal figures around Mr. Bush are one of the main reasons there is still no detailed set of goals for a second Bush Administration, which many Republican politicians consider a key to victory in November.
For example, it is difficult to overstate the degree of animosity some of the senior campaign personnel feel toward Richard Darman, the tough political infighter who heads the Office of Management and Budget. Many members of the campaign staff are convinced, they say, that he is making it impossible for Sam Skinner, the new White House chief of staff, to pull operations there together as they had counted upon Mr. Skinner to do.
In addition, Mr. Darman is seen as the principal author of the White House compromise with Congress that led to the tax increases that have eaten into the President's popularity. One of Mr. Bush's senior campaign aides said of Mr. Darman last week, "He's hurt the President more than any Democrat."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Reviewing Sanctions On Pretoria

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that he was reviewing New York City's sanctions against companies doing business in South Africa and had dispatched four of his top aides to Johannesburg for talks with black political leaders about possible changes in the city's position.
But the Mayor said he would stand fast on sanctions until the African National Congress, led by Nelson Mandela, requests that they be lifted. He said he was considering lifting some sanctions that hurt black South Africans while keeping those that punish the Government and the military. He said he would also push for guarantees that workers in those companies that are removed from the sanction list are treated fairly. 
 "For instance, those that do business directly with the military, it may not be time to deal with those folks," he said. "And then where sanctions are lifted, it may be desirable, I think, that there be some ground rules about how workers will be treated."
Under a 1990 local law, the city is prohibited from contracting with companies or banks with business ties to South Africa. The city also ranks banks according to how much they have done to encourage the end of the racist system and gives its business to those with the highest rankings. In addition, the city has avoided investing the $43.1 billion in pension funds it controls in companies that do business in South Africa.
 
'Sensitive Negotiations'
 On Sunday, a delegation of four top mayoral aides, a Board of Education official and a prominent Harlem businessman arrived in South Africa. Their hastily arranged trip was never announced because it involves "sensitive negotiations" on "the city's trading relationships as well as the city's investment," said Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's spokesman.
But other City Hall aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch kept the trip quiet because he feared it would stir controversy, as the Mayor's trip in November did. That journey raised eyebrows among good-government lobbyists when the Mayor used a quasi-public corporation to solicit contributions from companies that do business with the city. This time press aides to the Mayor did not tell reporters until after Mr. Lynch and others were on the ground in Johannesburg.
Asked whether the trip was kept under wraps to avoid criticism, the Mayor said, "It wasn't kept a secret. We just didn't announce it, per se."
The city paid for the officials' passage. The businessman, Percy E. Sutton, a former Manhattan Borough President, paid his own way. The rest of the delegation were Mr. Lynch; Carol O'Cleireacain, the Finance Commissioner; O. Peter Sherwood, the city's Corporation Counsel, and David Scott, a Board of Education staff member. The cost to the city will be about $10,000, officials said.
 
Behind Closed Doors
 Yesterday, the Mayor's delegation met behind closed doors with Walter Sisulu, deputy president of the African National Congress, Gill Marcus, the congress's spokeswoman, said in Johannesburg. No announcement was made after the meeting.
Ms. Marcus insisted that the city delegation's visit did not signal that the national congress had dropped its opposition to lifting sanctions before an interim government was installed.
City officials said the trip was planned early last week after the A.N.C. foreign minister, Thabo Mbeki, telephoned Mr. Lynch and said the time was right to talk about the city's sanctions. On May 14, the parties trying to negotiate a new constitution are to sit down for another round of talks that could lead to an interim government.
Victor Mashabela, a New York representative of the African National Congress, said Mr. Lynch's mission was timed to coincide with the talks.
At home, Mr. Dinkins has been under more and more pressure from banks and some large corporations to consider changing the sanctions at once since some progress has been made toward establishing a new government, city officials said.

HEADLINE: Gain of 28.17 Lifts the Dow To a Record

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose sharply to record highs yesterday, propelled by optimism that the Federal Reserve Board will lower interest rates another notch.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 28.17 points, to 3,397.58. It was the 19th record close for the Dow this year, surpassing the high of 3,378.13 set on May 4. 
 In the broad market, advances led declines by 1,100 to 660, but New York Stock Exchange volume was a light 155.6 million shares, compared with 168.7 million Friday, as investors stayed away ahead of inflation data due out today.
 
Help From Abroad
Wall Street sentiment was also helped by increases in overseas markets, especially Japan, where the 225-share Nikkei average rose 1.3 percent.
"The foreign markets certainly were a help, Japan particularly," said Jack Conlon, managing director at Rothschild Inc. "Clearly, the bond market has been helpful here, too. The market is anticipating a rate cut."
Analysts said investors were betting that the Fed would lower interest rates to make sure the recovering economy did not suffer a recessionary relapse. The Fed last cut rates on April 9.
"Today's strength is not reflective of any economic data that should push the market up at this point," said Joseph Barthel, director of investment strategy at Fahnestock & Company. "What we will ultimately need is some Fed easing."
Rates were little changed in the Treasury market yesterday, where the key 30-year bond was off slightly from Friday afternoon to yield 7.88 percent.
Many analysts said the central bank would cut rates in the short term despite unexpected strength in the April jobs report, released Friday. They noted that although the economy was recovering, the strength of the rebound varied considerably by region and industry.
"The perception is that with weak money supply, the Fed still has to do something," said Ned Collins, executive vice president in charge of United States equity trading at Daiwa Securities. "I felt we would see a minor new high this week, but I'm not sure it means much unless the Fed does something."
Analysts said the easing could follow a meeting of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee meeting May 19.
 
Concern for Profit Taking
Some traders are concerned that the market could drop back in profit taking even if the Fed does move to cut rates.
If, by the time of a rate cut, "we are still going at anything that resembles the clip we are going at now, I think that will be the news you sell on," said Mr. Conlon of Rothschild.
Many investors stayed on the sidelines yesterday ahead of the Government's report today on April wholesale inflation.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 2.44, to 418.49; the American Stock Exchange index rose 1.72, to 395.84, and the composite index of all common stocks on the Big Board was up 1.27 points, to 230.47. The Nasdaq over-the-counter index was up 1.37, to 587.13.
Among active issues, Wal-Mart Stores rose 7/8, to 52 7/8, after the retailer posted a 26 percent increase in first-quarter sales and earnings.
I.B.M. added 3/4, to 93 7/8, as Barry Bosak, a Smith Barney analyst, reiterated a buy recommendation.
 
Strength in Banking
Banks and financial shares gained on renewed rumors of merger speculation among several large banks, traders said. First Interstate surged 2 1/2, to 44 3/8; Wells Fargo rallied 4 5/8, to 86 3/8, and Citicorp added 3/8, to 19 1/2.
Banc One rose 3/4, to 44 3/4, as Nancy Bush, a Brown Brothers analyst, upgraded her rating.
Synoptics Communications rallied 1 1/2, to 26 5/8, as Wessels, Arnold & Henderson upgraded its rating on the computer network manufacturer.
Wellfleet Communications rose 2 1/4, to 33 1/4, as Alex. Brown repeated a strong buy rating on the computer equipment maker.

Wal-Mart's And May's Profits Up

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. produced another set of stunning numbers yesterday -- profits up 26.1 percent -- as the major retailers started reporting first-quarter earnings.
Sales were up across the board, reflecting improved consumer spending, and earnings benefited from strict cost controls imposed during the recession. The May Department Stores Company said profits rose 6.6 percent. May, like many retailers, had a weak first quarter last year, when the Persian Gulf war cut into consumer spending. Nordstrom Inc.'s earnings fell 16 percent from the extremely strong level of last year. 
 Easter was celebrated in April this year but in March last year, which skewed monthly sales comparisons in the last two months of the quarter. While retailers anticipated weaker March sales because of the switch in Easter dates, they expected April sales to offset them.
But inclement weather in April dampened demand for spring clothing, so markedly better sales failed to materialize before the end of the quarter.
Following are the details of the retailers' results:
 
Wal-Mart
 Wal-Mart posted record sales that raised its first-quarter profits to $387 million, or 34 cents a share, up from $307 million, or 27 cents a share, last year.
Earnings for the nation's largest retailer came in about a cent a share better than analysts' predictions. Wal-Mart shares closed yesterday at $52.875, up 87.5 cents.
"They're constantly upgrading their technical gadgetry," said William W. Whyte, an analyst at Stephens Inc., an investment bank in Little Rock, Ark. "While that incurs capital expenditures, the efficiencies they gain far outweigh the costs."
Mr. Whyte estimated that the retailer would post similar income gains throughout the year, ending up with earnings between $1.70 and $1.75 a share for the year.
Wal-Mart's sales grew 26 percent, to $11.6 billion, from $9.3 billion in the comparable period last year.
 
May Stores
 Earnings at May Department Stores rose to $81 million, or 60 cents a share, for the 13 weeks that ended May 2, compared with $76 million, or 56 cents a share, a year ag,o when the company's profits fell 5 percent.
May's performance was a bit below analysts' expectations. Wayne Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities Inc., said neither March nor April sales met the company's plans, which forced May to take greater markdowns. Sales increased 6 percent anyway, to $2.3 billion, from $2.17 billion in the first quarter of 1991.
The company's attention to costs helped bolster the bottom line in spite of weaker sales. "I think they're the best in the department store industry at controlling their expenses," Mr. Hood said. "What that means is that in spite of unexpected factors, if the economic recovery continues, they will have a better year."
He estimated that the company, which operates a number of department store chains including Foley's, the May Company and Lord & Taylor, will post earnings of about $4.50 a share this year. Shares of May closed yesterday at $55.875, up 37.5 cents
 
Nordstrom
 Nordstrom's profits dropped 16 percent in the quarter that ended April 30 to $21.6 million, or 26 cents a share, from $25.7 million, or 31 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter last year.
But sales climbed to $663.8 million, up 9 percent from $610.6 million in the first quarter of last year.
John A. Goesling, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Nordstrom, attributed the declining earnings to higher expenses. "Sales were up some, but when you subtract the higher costs in general in all our stores, they weren't up enough to offset higher expenses," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Slightly Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in quiet trading yesterday, as credit market participants readied themselves for release later in the week of economic statistics that most expect will be favorable for fixed-income investors.
"People have money to put to work, and we should get good statistics over the next week," said one Government-bond trader. "Right now is not an occasion to be aggressively bullish, but it is a time to be involved." 
 Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, estimated that the Treasury would make interest payments of just under $25 billion on Friday.
"There is a boodle of cash to be put to work," he said. "The question is whether investors perceive that this market has more to run. I tend to be a little more cautious than what seems to be the prevailing market sentiment."
 
Producer Price Numbers
 This week's stream of new data begins to flow today, with the release of April producer price numbers.
Most economists are forecasting that the Producer Price Index rose by a relatively modest three-tenths of 1 percent last month, and by the same amount when volatile energy and food prices are excluded.
Consumer price statistics, retail sales figures and industrial production data are among the other reports scheduled to be released over the next four days.
Aside from expectations that the data will show that the economy is recovering slowly and that inflation pressures are mild, traders began buying back short-term bills and notes on the chance that the Federal Reserve Board might decide to ease monetary policy once more.
Prices of short-term issues fell fairly sharply on Friday after the Labor Department reported that non-farm payroll employment rose by 126,000 in April, a bigger increase than most analysts had anticipated.
 
Making a Difference
 Victor Chang, president of VC Management, a New York-based money management firm, said, "I don't think the Fed needs to ease policy any more, but another quarter-point cut in the Federal funds rate would not make a material difference."
What is needed now, Mr. Chang said, is for the Fed to convey the message that it will maintain a stable monetary policy even as economic activity begins to pick up.
"The Fed can do that because inflation is not going to be a problem for the rest of this year and into 1993," Mr. Chang added. "That sort of signal would allow long-term interest rates to come down a bit."
Hopes that the Fed might ease helped fuel demand at the weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills yesterday.
At the auction, new three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.64 percent, down slightly from the 3.65 percent average rate at last week's sale.
Six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.74 percent, compared with 3.78 percent at the auction a week earlier.
 
Long Bond Rises
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10110/32 , up 3/32 , to yield 7.88 percent, compared with 7.89 percent late Friday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10027/32 , up 3/32 , to yield 7.37 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 10011/32 , up 5/32 , to yield 5.18 percent.
Corporations, which were notably absent from the new-issue market last week because of the Treasury's refunding auctions, were more active yesterday.
Roughly $1.25 billion worth of new securities were priced yesterday, including 30-year debentures by the Georgia Pacific Corporation and Dow Capital B.V.
The $250 million worth of 9.50 percent Georgia Pacific securities were priced at $99.15 to yield 9.587 percent, 1.70 percentage points more than the prevailing yield on the 8 percent 29 1/2-year Treasury bonds at the time of pricing.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting.
The securities, which are noncallable for 10 years, are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
$150 Million Offering
 Dow Capital B.V. offered $150 million of 8.70 percent debentures through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The securities were priced at $98.781 to yield 8.816 percent, 92 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for 10 years, is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities said that trading was slow and that prices of most outstanding securities were unchanged.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Lower And Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower in quiet foreign exchange dealings yesterday.
Gold prices were mostly mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $336.70 a troy ounce, up 70 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose 90 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $336.30. 
 Analysts said the dollar remained locked in a trading range, with virtually no news to influence its direction.
Michael Malpede, an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago, attributed the dollar's decline to two factors -- steady monetary policy in Germany and skepticism over the strength of the United States economic recovery.
He said that until monetary policy changed in Germany, interest-rate differentials favored a lower dollar. German interest rates are at historically high levels, which translate to attractive returns for those who invest in mark-denominated securities.
Mr. Malpede said that traders, meanwhile, wanted to see further confirmation that the economic recovery in the United States would not be derailed. If the recovery slows -- or worse, vanishes -- the Federal Reserve would be more inclined to lower rates here, a further disadvantage for the dollar.
"So until Germany eases rates or the U.S. economy strengthens more, we're caught in a trading range," he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 133.17 yen, up 0.62 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 133.15 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 133.00 yen, down from 133.45 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7935, up from $1.7885 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.7945 to buy one pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.7910.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6390 German marks, down from 1.6445; 1.5255 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.5095 French francs, down from 5.5335; 1,233.25 Italian lire, down from 1,238.00, and 1.2056 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2028.
