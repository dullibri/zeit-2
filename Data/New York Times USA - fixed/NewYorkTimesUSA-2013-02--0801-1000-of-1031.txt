HEADLINE: Robert C. Richardson, 75, Laureate in Physics, Dies

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
Robert C. Richardson, who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics for coaxing a rare form of helium into a bizarre liquid state that had never been seen before, died on Tuesday in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 75.
The cause was complications of a heart attack he suffered three weeks earlier, according to Cornell University, where Dr. Richardson had been a physics professor since 1968.
In 1971, Dr. Richardson and two colleagues -- David M. Lee, also a physics professor, and Douglas D. Osheroff, a graduate student -- collaborated on a technically challenging experiment, exploring the properties of atoms a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. 
They cooled helium-3, a lighter variant of helium, to within a few thousandths of a degree of absolute zero. Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, at which motion comes to almost a complete stop.
In that deep freeze, liquid helium-3 turns into what physicists call a superfluid -- a liquid that flows without friction.
''I quickly tell people it has no practical applications,'' Dr. Osheroff said in an interview on Wednesday. But the discovery has enabled scientists to study a variety of scientific problems, including basic quantum interactions at the atomic level. The Nobel Prize committee deemed the experiment a breakthrough in basic physics.
Decades earlier, scientists had discovered that helium-4, the common form of helium that fills balloons and airships, becomes a superfluid at minus 456 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 3.5 degrees above absolute zero. But because helium-4 has one additional neutron, it exhibits very different properties as a superfluid from what the Cornell physicists discovered.
In fact, the helium-3 data turned out to be so different from what theorists had predicted that the three researchers initially misinterpreted what they had created.
The experiment was also one of the first uses of nuclear magnetic resonance to generate images out of radio waves emitted by the atoms. That is the same principle that underlies the M.R.I. machines that doctors today use to peer inside patients' bodies.
Dr. Richardson was later a member of the National Science Board, the policy-making body of the National Science Foundation. He was one of the authors of a National Academy of Sciences report in 2005 that urgently called for better science education and other measures to keep the United States competitive in a global economy.
Robert Coleman Richardson was born on June 26, 1937, in Washington, the first child of Robert F. and Lois Price Richardson. (A sister, Addie, was born two years later.) The family lived in Arlington, Va. His father, the son of a rural general store owner who traced his family to early Colonial times, worked for a telephone company; his mother grew up an orphan in North Carolina and earned a master's degree in history.
Robert attended Washington-Lee High School in Arlington. ''There was nothing exceptional about the math and science training at Washington-Lee,'' he wrote in his autobiography for the Nobel Prize. ''The idea of 'advanced placement' had not yet been invented. I did not take a calculus course until my second year of college. The biology and physics courses were very old-fashioned.''
He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in physics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
''I was not an especially diligent student but nevertheless obtained a reasonable education in physics,'' he wrote. ''I graduated with a B average and fourth in a group of about nine physics majors.''
At the time he thought he would go to business school, with the aim of becoming a corporate executive. But he remained at Virginia Tech for one more year to obtain a master's degree in physics. Afterward he served in the Army for half a year rather than the usual two-year enlistment. He called his abbreviated service a ''great piece of good fortune'' when ''the Army ran short of money.''
In the Army he received training in managing a platoon that repaired jeeps and tanks. The experience, he said, soured him on becoming an executive. He decided to return to physics and graduate school, this time at Duke.
There he began working with helium-3, which was then still a rare substance, a byproduct of the atomic age. The common form, helium-4, has a nucleus of two protons and two neutrons. Helium-3, with two protons and only one neutron, is extremely rare in nature. But it forms in the decay of tritium, a key ingredient of the hydrogen bomb.
With the advent of nuclear arsenals in the 1950s, helium-3 became available for physicists to experiment with. For his doctoral research, Dr. Richardson studied solid helium-3 using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.
''He was very quick in understanding what was going on,'' said Horst Meyer, his thesis adviser at Duke. ''He was a very persistent and hard worker. All qualities that very much endeared him to me.''
Dr. Richardson moved to Cornell in 1966 as a postdoctoral researcher and was promoted to assistant professor two years later.
He served as Cornell's first vice provost for research from 1998 to 2003 and was a member of the board at Duke from 1997 to 2007. He was also a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Richardson is survived by his wife, Betty; his daughter, Jennifer Merlis; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Test Scores of Hispanics Vary Widely Across 5 Most Populous States, Analysis Shows

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Of all the changes sweeping through the American public education system, one of the most significant is simply demographic: the growing population of Hispanic students.
A new analysis released Thursday of nationwide test results in the five most populous states -- California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas -- shows that depending on where they live, Hispanic students' academic performance varies widely.
According to the report, which examines data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, often cited as the most reliable standard in academic testing, Hispanic students accounted for more than half of all eighth graders in California in 2011, the highest proportion in the country. But only 14 percent of those students were proficient on eighth-grade reading tests administered by the United States Department of Education. 
In Florida, 27 percent of Hispanic students (who represent just over a quarter of its public school students) scored at the proficient level or above. And in Illinois, 23 percent of Hispanic eighth graders were proficient in reading.
In mathematics, Hispanic eighth graders in California similarly underperformed their peers in other states, with just 13 percent hitting the proficiency mark, compared with 22 percent in Florida and 31 percent in Texas, where Hispanics make up more than half the eighth-grade student population.
In prepared remarks for a panel to discuss the report on Thursday, Richard Zeiger, chief deputy superintendent of public instruction for the California Department of Education, pointed out that one in four students in California is an English-language learner, the highest proportion in the country. He said that in addition to the state's demographic challenges, the schools had been hampered by ''a sustained disinvestment in public education, made all the more severe by the Great Recession.''
California's struggles were not confined to Hispanic students. Over all, the state's fourth and eighth graders underperformed the national average in reading, math and science. One bright spot in the state came from gains shown by black students in fourth-grade reading and math scores over two decades.
The report examined data from the five largest states -- which together enroll close to 40 percent of public school students in the country -- across a range of factors, including the poverty status of students and improvements in test scores over two decades.
Jack Buckley, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, which compiled the report, said there was no ''consistent pattern among these states,'' adding, ''each state seems to have areas where it shines and others where they lag behind its counterparts.''
Florida led the five states in improving fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores between 1992 and 2011, although average reading scores among the state's eighth graders just reached the national average in 2011. Florida's fourth graders also led the five largest states in gains in math scores, while eighth graders still scored below the national average in 2011.
These results ''validate the efforts of Florida teachers and the focus the state has put on academic achievement in a state that is as diverse as this,'' Tony Bennett, the newly appointed commissioner of the Florida Department of Education, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Bennett also acknowledged that while the state had outperformed other large states in pushing achievement among Hispanic and black students, white students either trailed their peers in the rest of the country or were just at the national average. ''People look at these almost as a diagnosis, and I don't see it that way,'' he said. ''I see this much more in terms of a checkup and where we have to go from here.''
Texas showed the strongest advances in eighth-grade math scores since 1990, and was the only state among the five whose eighth-grade math and science scores were above the national average. In a statement, Michael L. Williams, commissioner of the Texas Education Agency, said the results ''speak to an emphasis Texas has placed on a critical core subject.''
In New York, fourth graders scored above the national average in reading in 2011. Eighth-grade scores were close to the national average but showed very little progress since 1998. Both fourth and eighth graders in New York lagged behind the national average on math tests.
Ken Slentz, deputy commissioner for P-12 education at the New York Department of Education, said the percentage of children reaching proficiency in either math or reading was ''unacceptably low.''
New York students' scores appeared to be influenced in particular by whether they were enrolled in city or suburban schools. In eighth-grade reading, for example, the percentage of urban students who were proficient was 26 percent, compared with 43 percent of suburban children.
''The exposure that our urban children have to high levels of learning versus typical suburban students -- there are marked differences,'' Mr. Slentz said. ''Whether it's access to public libraries, to well-developed after-school programs, there is a difference between what the suburban kids have at their fingertips versus what urban kids have.''

Previews and Openings
'Ann' (in previews; opens on March 7) Not many people could play both Nancy Reagan and Ann Richards, but Holland Taylor is not most people. Long before she cornered the market on feisty WASPdom on television shows like ''Two and a Half Men'' and ''The Practice,'' Ms. Taylor was racking up theater credits in shows like ''Butley'' and ''The Cocktail Hour.'' (And, yes, ''Moose Murders.'') Now she returns to Broadway in a one-woman tribute (which she also wrote) to the larger-than-life former governor of Texas, who, when she was the state treasurer of Texas, had some choice comments for Mrs. Reagan's husband in her keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Eric Grode) 
'Belleville' (in previews; opens on March 3) Amy Herzog's plays continue to take on darker shadows, as family-focused works like ''After the Revolution'' and ''4000 Miles'' give way to ''The Great God Pan,'' which looked at repressed childhood memories, and now this examination of a fraying American couple in Paris. Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller return to the roles they originated at Yale Repertory Theater in 2011, when Charles Isherwood, in his review for The New York Times, called it ''a thrillingly good play.'' It is directed, as it was in 2011, by Anne Kauffman (''The Thugs,'' ''Maple and Vine''), who does creepy naturalism better than just about anyone. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org. (Grode)
'Carousel' (opens on Wednesday) The New York Philharmonic once again takes on a semistaged classic of American musical theater, commingling marquee names from Broadway and the opera world. Kelli O'Hara and Nathan Gunn star as Julie Jordan and Billy Bigelow, and the supporting cast includes (in addition to those dozens of dapper men and women with the musical instruments) Stephanie Blythe, John Cullum, Shuler Hensley and the New York City Ballet principal dancers Robert Fairchild and Tiler Peck. Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org. (Grode)
'The Dance and the Railroad' (in previews; opens on Monday) Each Signature Theater season typically features at least one relative obscurity by the honored playwright, and this year's David Henry Hwang season is no exception. This 1981 play, which was only Mr. Hwang's second, uses the conventions of Chinese opera to illuminate the story of two Chinese immigrant workers in the California mountains during the building of the Transcontinental Railroad. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'Detroit '67' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 12) The Public Theater's smaller-scale Public Lab series has teamed up with the always intriguing Classical Theater of Harlem to present this world premiere by Dominique Morisseau. Motown released more than 100 singles in 1967 -- and just about every one made the charts -- but reality would soon interrupt in the form of one of the worst riots in American history. Ms. Morisseau's play contains both of these threads and much more. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Grode)
'The Flick' (in previews; opens on March 12) Underpaid young workers in small-town New England certainly paid off for Annie Baker and her frequent director, Sam Gold, in 2010 with their critical smash ''The Aliens.'' Now the formidable duo, who also collaborated on ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' and Ms. Baker's ''Uncle Vanya'' translation, have turned their attention to three undermotivated employees of a rundown Massachusetts movie theater. The news release promises ''tiny battles and not-so-tiny heartbreaks.'' The track record promises a good bit more than that. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Hands on a Hardbody' (previews start on Saturday; opens on March 21) Despite a megaplex's worth of movies making their way to Broadway as musicals, one genre that rarely makes the jump is documentaries. ''Grey Gardens'' was a rare exception, and that musical's book writer, Doug Wright, is handling the same task on this project, based on a 1997 film about (ready for this?) an endurance competition to see who can touch a pickup truck for the longest time. The music was composed by Amanda Green (''Bring It On'') and a curious newcomer to Broadway: Trey Anastasio of the jam band Phish. The cast includes Keith Carradine, Mary Gordon Murray, Hunter Foster and Connie Ray. Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Grode)
'Henry IV, Part 1' (in previews; opens on March 3) Following the Pearl Theater's last show, the one-man ''In Acting Shakespeare,'' comes a more straightforward take on the playwright. (''Henry V'' is scheduled for next season.) Shakespeare is old hat for the Pearl cast by now, but the choice of director is an intriguing one: Davis McCallum. He has earned a sterling reputation for directing new plays, most recently ''Water by the Spoonful'' and ''The Whale,'' but the classics are a relatively uncharted territory for him. Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Grode)
'Hit the Wall' (in previews; opens on March 10) The West Village is rich with cultural milestones, and one of the biggest came on June 28, 1969. That's when a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, exploded into a riot that would serve as a catalyst for the gay rights movement. Ike Holter's new play, which made its debut last year as part of Steppenwolf's Garage Rep series, blends history and mythology as it puts audiences on the periphery of that epochal conflict. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Grode)
'Jackie' (previews start on Sunday; opens on March 5) When the Austrian playwright and novelist Elfriede Jelinek was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2004, it occasioned all sorts of hand-wringing over her trenchant, often graphic writings. One member of the committee resigned in protest. New York theater audiences will get a rare chance to see her work in this Women's Project production, which is being called an ''intensely theatrical dissection'' of the myths surrounding Jackie Kennedy Onassis. Hold on to your pillbox hats. City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)
'Katie Roche' (in previews; opens on Monday) To the extent that New York theatergoers know anything about the 20th-century Irish playwright Teresa Deevy, it is because of the Mint Theater. The enterprising ensemble, which is also publishing two volumes of her writings, wraps up its three-play Deevy retrospective with this 1936 drama about a wildly ambitious servant girl. The Abbey Theater brought it to America in 1937, but this is the first American production. The Mint's artistic director, Jonathan Bank, directs once again. 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Grode)
'The Lying Lesson' (in previews; opens on March 13) Craig Lucas likes to play with shifting identities, as he did via the chat-room shenanigans in ''The Dying Gaul'' and the body swapping of ''Prelude to a Kiss.'' Here the playwright has created a woman (played by Carol Kane) who may or may not be Bette Davis. Her seemingly clueless young assistant is quickly embroiled in a series of cat-and-mouse games -- a form of theatrical combat in which the director, Pam MacKinnon (''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''), has become an expert. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'The Madrid' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) When a kindergarten teacher one day gets up and walks out of work, she leaves in the lurch not only a batch of blinking 5-year-olds but also a loving husband and a daughter. Liz Flahive makes her return to Manhattan Theater Club, which presented her domestic drama ''From Up Here'' in 2008, with this new work and Edie Falco in tow. Leigh Silverman, who directed ''From Up Here'' and has a way with plays about troublesome parents (''Well,'' ''Coraline''), teams up with Ms. Flahive again here. City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)
'The Mound Builders' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 17) A highlight of the Signature Theater's longstanding relationship with Lanford Wilson was the 2003 revival of ''Fifth of July.'' That was directed by Jo Bonney, who returns a decade later to stage Wilson's 1975 drama about a vexed archaeological dig in the Midwest. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'The North Pool' (in previews; opens on March 6) After several well-received Off Broadway plays, Rajiv Joseph hit the big time in 2011 when Robin Williams starred in his ''Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo'' on Broadway. Now Mr. Joseph heads back downtown with this psychological thriller about a game of cat and mouse conducted between a high school principal and a transfer student from the Middle East. Giovanna Sardelli, who has directed nearly all of Mr. Joseph's other Off Broadway pieces, does the same here. Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Grode)
'The Old Boy' (in previews; opens on March 5) Playwrights as prolific as A. R. Gurney tend not to pick favorites among their works. Who can remember them all? That said, Mr. Gurney has referred to this 1991 play, about a politician who confronts some unexpected demons when he returns to his New England prep school, as ''a favorite but somewhat neglected child.'' Enter the Keen Company to bestow a little attention. Mr. Gurney has also done a bit of revisiting, as the script is being billed as ''newly revised.'' Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Old Hats' (in previews; opens on March 4) There are few details about this piece, but here's all you really need to know: Bill Irwin and David Shiner are together again. The duo created stage magic in various iterations of the uproarious ''Fool Moon,'' and now they and their director, Tina Landau, promise more of the same: mime, magic, music (courtesy of Nellie McKay) and mayhem. Mr. Irwin's more recent stage performances have included convincing takes on Albee, Shakespeare and even Beckett, but he still presumably has a good pratfall or three left in him. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'Passion' (in previews; opens on Thursday) With the recent glut of Stephen Sondheim revivals, revues and tributes, it is easy to forget that the last time a new Sondheim show had its debut on Broadway was in 1994. That's when his and James Lapine's haunting chamber musical about love and obsession opened, only to close after eight months. A revival is long overdue, and the director John Doyle (this time dispensing with his usual actors-doubling-as-musicians tactic) has cast two formidable women who have also been much missed on the New York stage, Melissa Errico and Judy Kuhn. Ryan Silverman rounds out the central love triangle. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Grode)
'The Revisionist' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Typically, Michael Chernus or maybe Seth Numrich qualifies as a marquee name at a Rattlestick Playwrights Theater show. Enter Jesse Eisenberg and Vanessa Redgrave, who make up two-thirds of the cast of Mr. Eisenberg's new play. His previous work for the stage, ''Asuncion,'' was also a Rattlestick production. This time around he plays a man with terrible writer's block; she plays a Holocaust survivor (and his second cousin) who has a few complicating secrets about their family's past. Daniel Oreskes also stars. Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Grode)
'Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella' (in previews; opens on March 3) The 1957 television musical of ''Cinderella'' was a runaway smash and almost immediately began spawning stage incarnations, starring Eartha Kitt, Everett Quinton and Jean Stapleton (though they weren't cast in the title role). But this staging is the property's first appearance on Broadway, complete with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane (''Sister Act,'' ''The Little Dog Laughed'') and four fairly obscure songs from the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog. Laura Osnes stars as Cinderella, and she is surrounded by three formidable scene stealers: Harriet Harris, Victoria Clark and Ann Harada. Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Talley's Folly' (in previews; opens on March 5) Two years after his death, Lanford Wilson is beginning to receive his due on New York stages. The Signature's revival of his ''Mound Builders'' opens in a few weeks, but first comes Mr. Wilson's 1980 Pulitzer Prize winner, a wistful 1940s romance between a Jewish immigrant (Danny Burstein) and a Protestant nurse (Sarah Paulson) in rural Missouri. Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Grode)
'Trevor' (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 2) After teaming up to virtuosic effect on the potty-mouthed-sock-puppet play, ''Hand to God,'' Moritz von Stuelpnagel is once again directing Steven Boyer. This time they're working with a volatile 200-pound chimpanzee who dreams of a comeback in showbiz. The author, Nick Jones, turned his own share of heads with the potty-mouthed-pirate-puppet play, ''Jollyship the Whiz-bang,'' so this looks to be a fruitful pairing. Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Grode)
'The Wild Bride' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Wednesday) When you sell your daughter to the devil, it's hard to take much consolation in the fact that it was an accident. Such is the central predicament in this adaptation of the Brothers Grimm's ''Girl Without Hands,'' here presented by the sprightly British company Kneehigh (best known for its stylish take on the Noël Coward film ''Brief Encounter'') and featuring live bluegrass music. St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' A four-alarm urgency infuses Scarlett Johansson's performance in Rob Ashford's oxygen-starved revival of Tennessee Williams's 1955 drama of sex and lies. If Ms. Johansson is oddly un-feline as Maggie the Cat, she sure has presence. The rest of the cast, including Benjamin Walker and Ciaran Hinds, gets lost in the heavy atmospherics (2:40). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Other Place' Laurie Metcalf gives a captivating, complicated performance in Sharr White's clever puzzle of a drama, portraying a woman grappling with sudden onset of a mysterious illness at the same time as her personal life -- disloyal husband (Bill Pullman), estranged daughter (Zoe Perry) -- threatens to implode. Joe Mantello's nimble direction ratchets up the suspense (1:10). Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder.

&#x2605; 'All in the Timing' One of the zestier plates of theatrical tapas to be had. This 20th-anniversary production of David Ives's popular anthology of mini-plays, directed by John Rando, leaves you feeling lighter, but not emptier. There's nutrition in these sketches about (gulp!) relativity and randomness, and surprising substance in their silliness. Carson Elrod leads a bouncy cast (1:45). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Brantley)

'Clive' Jonathan Marc Sherman's adaptation of ''Baal,'' an early Brecht play about a poète maudit, has the potential to electrify. But the current that flows through this version, directed by and starring Ethan Hawke, is oddly sluggish. Brecht's tale of a degenerate society assumes the air of a wearily confirmed prophecy. Vincent D'Onofrio, a great wild-card actor, provides some electricity (1:45). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.

'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (David Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)

'Luck of the Irish' Kirsten Greenidge's play, about race, class and real estate, is set in the 1950s and the 2000s. The plot turns on the disputed possession of a house in a lush Boston suburb.

'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

'Really Really' The young playwright Paul Downs Colaizzo shows an assured appreciation of the addictive power of ambiguity in this merciless state-of-a-generation play, set on a college campus. Yet because of its blanket bleakness, nothing in it surprises us. Zosia Mamet is excellent as an upwardly mobile college student who becomes both victim and predator.

'The Vandal' The playwriting debut of the actor Hamish Linklater is a modest comedy-drama of two lonely souls, a widow (the wonderful Deirdre O'Connell) and widower (Zach Grenier, ditto), brought together by a talky youngster played by the puckish Noah Robbins.

'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language.

&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00).

'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke.

'All the Rage' (closes on Sunday) In Martin Moran's artfully rambling one-man show about anger (expressed and sublimated), the map of self-discovery is part of no known GPS program.

Some of the prose is enchanting and evocative, like Proust's meditation on the connection between taste and involuntary memory. But with more than 27 texts and dozens of epigraphs, the show has more courses than the tasting menu at Alinea, and is much less gratifying (1:45).

'The Man Who Laughs' (closes on Sunday) The Stolen Chair Theater Company's revival of its 2005 adaptation of Victor Hugo's 1869 novel nods to Paul Leni's 1928 German Expressionist version with an ingenious simulation of silent film, the actors mouthing their words between intertitles. The comedy and romance here are charming, but the source material's dark underpinnings receive comparatively short shrift. Fortunately, the ending is more Hugo than Hollywood (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, stolenchair.org. (Webster)
'The Mark of Zorro' (closes on Sunday) How can you lure children raised on computer-generated imagery and high-tech special effects to a swashbuckling adventure with only three actors, a few props and dozens of plastic cutouts? You'd need clever design, highly skilled performers and plenty of fancy footwork. That's mostly what you get in this adaptation of the tale of the masked justice-seeker Zorro, performed by Visible Fictions, a Scottish troupe. The story's violence may give some parents pause, but in pure inventiveness, the show is a triumph (1:05). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org. (Laurel Graeber)
'Off the King's Road' (closes on Saturday) With a crazy cat lady, an over-the-top desk clerk, a Croatian prostitute and a California psychiatrist who drinks, Neil Koenigsberg's story of a lonely American widower on vacation in London could have been trite. But a great cast, nuanced direction and endearing characters make up for a lot, even the occasional awkward exposition (1:30).

'Picnic' (closes on Sunday) A torso stars in Sam Gold's stultifying revival of William Inge's time-yellowed 1953 play, set in lusty, dusty Kansas. The torso belongs to Sebastian Stan as a handsome drifter whose bare pecs and abs stir deep longings in lonely bosoms.

HEADLINE: Weighing Prospect of Changes In Graduation Requirements

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Following backlash over the rocky institution of a new student assessment system last spring, Texas lawmakers are scrambling to scale back the requirements they passed four years ago. As the Legislature tackles such reform, attention is also focused on another area of education policy: high school graduation requirements.
Wrapped up in legislation that reduces the number of state-mandated standardized exams are several measures that redefine the curriculum prescribed for a high school diploma in favor of loosening the required courses for graduation.
The plans have received support from superintendents and public school educators, who say the new flexibility would give students the ability to focus on their interests and encourage them to continue their education. Industry and trade groups are also supportive, saying the changes would get people with the skills they need into the work force sooner.
But some state education officials and business leaders said they worried that such legislation could sweep away a decade's worth of hard-won progress in improving students' preparation for college and careers. 
''The concern about too much testing has been conflated with the curriculum itself, and I think those two issues need to be just disaggregated,'' said Raymund Paredes, the commissioner of the state's Higher Education Coordinating Board.
Michael Williams, the Texas Education Agency commissioner, has also expressed concern. At a February meeting of the University of Texas System Board of Regents, he implored higher education leaders to speak up on potential changes to high school graduation requirements; he said he feared that some of the proposals could ''erase some of the gains'' in public education.
The state requires high school students graduating on the ''recommended'' plan -- about 70 percent of students -- to complete four credits each in science, social studies, English language arts and math. The Legislature approved the so-called 4x4 curriculum, which took effect during the 2007-8 school year, in an effort to improve students' preparation for higher education. For other students, there is a ''minimum plan'' with looser requirements.
The state has advanced in that area, although it is still behind where many educators said it should be. In 2011, 52 percent of students met the state's college-ready standards, which are based on standardized test scores in English and math, compared with 35 percent five years ago. Among economically disadvantaged students, who represent the increasing majority of public school enrollment, 32 percent met the standards, compared with 18 percent five years ago.
Despite that progress, there has been a push to make sure career properly balances college in the career- and college-ready equation and that the rigidity of the current plan does not create an insurmountable barrier for students who want to go directly into the work force.
But officials disagree about how to do that. Some said they believed the current system provided the academic exposure needed to succeed in higher education, and some wanted more opportunity for high school students to explore different pathways to careers.
Measures from education leaders in the Legislature -- including Jimmie Don Aycock, Republican of Killeen, the House public education chairman; Dan Patrick, Republican of Houston, the Senate education chairman; and Kel Seliger, Republican of Amarillo, the Senate higher education chairman -- move the state away from the 4x4.
Though their bills vary, each would require fewer years of math, science and social studies in favor of allowing students to earn diploma ''endorsements'' by completing additional credits in areas like humanities, engineering, and business and industry.
The state high school graduation requirements have become inflexible to ''the point that it thwarts career development and student choice,'' Mr. Aycock said this week at a hearing where teachers, superintendents and parents from across the state proposed changes to state testing and graduation requirements.
Major public education advocacy groups and associations, including Raise Your Hand Texas, the Texas Association of School Boards and the Texas Association of School Administrators, favor the proposed changes, which they said would engage more students in pursuing their career goals. A coalition of 22 trade associations -- which Hector Rivero, the Texas Chemical Council president, told lawmakers was formed out of a concern that public schools did not produce enough skilled workers for the state's surge of manufacturing and industrial jobs -- said the proposed bills represented the needs of employers in the state.
''When you go out and you talk to superintendents and teachers and parents and kids and they tell you that nobody ever told us about these opportunities that existed and what the educational needs and requirements are to fill these jobs, that is what we feel is a travesty,'' Mr. Rivero said.
But other education leaders said they feared that the proposals shifted the focus too far from the academic foundation they believed students needed for long-term success in the work force.
Even if there are currently high-paying jobs in fields that do not require postsecondary education, Mr. Paredes said, that will not always be the case.
He cited a Georgetown University study that showed virtually all of the jobs created since the 2007 recession required education beyond high school and that opportunities for those without a degree continue to dwindle.
''There's an increasing amount of information that suggests career technical education is going to be done increasingly in two-year institutions because once again, the demands of advanced manufacturing jobs and high-skilled industrial jobs are growing,'' he said.
High school, Mr. Paredes said, needs to prepare students to be successful in that setting. Discussion about the graduation requirements, he said, has given insufficient attention to whether students will be prepared to do that higher-level work once they leave secondary education.
An analysis from the state higher education board estimates that almost 6,000 additional students annually would need remedial education once they reached four-year and community colleges, a cost of $2.3 million a year as a result of altering the high school curriculum.
The talk of diploma endorsements has also raised old fears about the shuttling of minority and low-income students into vocational programs.
''Having worked both as a school board member and a teacher, I also know too often what the default is, about students and the quality of their courses being based on where they live and the part of town and the color of their skin,'' said John Fitzpatrick, the executive director of Educate Texas, which promotes college preparation and work force development.
But proponents of the more flexible graduation plans insist that a new day has dawned for career and technical education -- and that it will not share the flaws of a previous generation's vocational programs. Clinging to the current plan, they say, will only stifle students.
''I believe we have defined high standards and rigor in the state at a level which is inaccurate,'' H. D. Chambers, the superintendent of Alief Independent School District, said at the House Public Education Committee hearing this week. ''What I would argue is that this graduation flexibility plan, would allow meaningful rigor. The endorsements create meaningful rigor in an area in which that student and that family has chosen to pursue.''

HEADLINE: At a Loss On Refusing Medicaid Cash

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Slogans can get in the way of politics. A number of the combatants in the quarrel over Medicaid expansion in Texas regularly tell voters that government should be run more like a business.
State officials, starting with Gov. Rick Perry, want the state to stay away from any expansion outlined in the federal Affordable Care Act. They object to creating an entitlement program where none currently exists, because they say they fear it will grow into a money-gobbling monument to big government -- socialism, even.
Besides, they say, Texas doesn't have enough doctors and other medical professionals to provide care for the newly insured. 
Those are political arguments. The business arguments -- the financial arguments -- go in the other direction. The state could abandon the expansion whenever it wants. In the meantime, the vast majority of the costs would be borne by the federal government. Turning away from a pot of money because it might disappear some day? Texas was built on businesses -- oil, gas, real estate, agriculture -- that ebb and flow, boom and bust.
And politicians understand how businesses operate.
The governor is poaching jobs from other states, evangelizing in the name of economic development on behalf of Texas; that's sufficiently predatory enough and potentially profitable enough to qualify in some circles as businesslike. (Yes, he might also be running for national office again, but Ann Richards, who didn't have national aspirations, made similar forays into other states.)
On the other hand, the governor has been a full-time government employee since 1991.
Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst is investigating what he says is a top aide's multimillion-dollar embezzlement from his campaign accounts. In the political sense, it is going to be difficult for Mr. Dewhurst to argue that his prowess as a businessman and his mastery over money deserve more time on the state payroll. But the self-made zillionaire obviously knows how to run a business -- that's how he got rich.
Both Mr. Perry and Mr. Dewhurst can claim to know how the business world works, whether their recent records support it or not. But look at the capper: They and others are talking seriously about walking away from a gargantuan federal freebie.
The federal government is offering to pay all of the costs of expanding the Medicaid program to some of the state's uninsured population for three years, then to pay 90 percent of the costs for several years after that. Texas could, according to a report commissioned by Texas Impact, an interfaith public policy group, spend $15 billion over the next 10 years and pull down $100 billion in federal funds as a result.
Here's the business question: Why leave that kind of money on the table, especially if it's going to be spent elsewhere if Texas opts out?
The argument for expansion is that it would take care of a lot of people for some period of time -- even if it doesn't take care of them forever. The choice is between insuring a crowd of people for a few or many years, or not insuring them at all. Between providing their health care in expensive and inefficient emergency rooms, or taking care of them by expanding Medicaid.
It's not just a good-government take-care-of-those-less-fortunate thing, either. Medicaid has enough flaws to feed a dozen think tanks. But by expanding Medicaid, the state would also bring in billions of dollars to pay for health care for people who aren't insured now, providing relief to local taxpayers who wouldn't be on the hook for nearly as much uncompensated care, turbocharging the state's medical economy, and bringing federal tax dollars paid by Texans back into the state.
If you don't do that last bit, by the way, the money would otherwise go to places like California, Massachusetts, New York. Where's the business sense in that? And where, because that's a transfer of wealth in some measure from red to blue states, is the political sense?
It might be true that a Medicaid expansion will work only for a few years in Texas and other states; they can quit if that time comes. For many officeholders, it makes political sense to opt out. But if they were running state government like a business, without the political undertow, the conversation would already be over.

HEADLINE: Pastoral Uruguay Yields a Crop of Digital Yetis and Adventures

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Mauricio Rabuffetti contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- For a start-up that has a hit video game for the iPhone, the new loft-style offices of Ironhide Game Studio are exactly what one would expect -- a newly hired staff labors feverishly on software updates not far from a pinball machine and custom-built monster arcade cabinet intended for letting off steam.
But the company, a success in the fiercely competitive field of video game development, stands out from other high-tech ventures in one respect: its unconventional location, which frequently confuses people abroad. ''They politely ask, 'Where is Uruguay?' '' said Álvaro Azofra, one of the three founders of Ironhide, the company behind Kingdom Rush, a lucratively popular game in the United States that involves a cartoonish kingdom under attack by marauding yetis and ogres. 
Squeezed between Brazil and Argentina and long dependent on commodities exports, Uruguay may be better known for its flocks of sheep and herds of cattle. But attention is now shifting to the country's growing constellation of start-ups that are engineering video games for computers and hand-held devices.
Developers point to a variety of reasons that Uruguay has been able to compete with South America's larger economies, whether the creativity of its engineers and commercial artists or its relatively relaxed immigration rules and extensive use of computers in schools.
''It's ironic, because historically, this is a country that hates entrepreneurship, but not the culture of entrepreneurship,'' said Gonzalo Frasca, a video game theorist whose company, Powerful Robot, has developed numerous games for clients in the United States, including Legends of Ooo, based on the Cartoon Network animated television series ''Adventure Time.''
Mr. Frasca, 40, contrasted the skepticism that persists in relation to private enterprise in Uruguay's cradle-to-grave welfare state, in which companies in sectors like telecommunications, casinos and even whiskey production remain under state control, with the country's robust tradition of creativity in the arts and sciences.
''We still have strong schools for computer science,'' said Mr. Frasca, who has a doctorate in video game studies from IT University of Copenhagen and is a pioneer in Uruguay's game industry. ''When people graduate, they realize they're in a small country where they have no choice but to engage with the rest of the world.''
While ORT, Uruguay's largest private university, offers one of the region's first degrees in video game design, the relaxed atmosphere of seaside Montevideo -- the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano once remarked that his countrymen resembled ''Argentines on Valium'' -- can still make it seem as if it would be an unlikely place for technology start-ups to thrive.
Other parts of Latin America are nurturing their own video game development scenes. Chile, for instance, recently drew attention when Atakama Labs, a game developer based in Santiago, was acquired by the Japanese gaming company DeNA.
Gaming studios have also emerged in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's two largest cities, but developers there complain of byzantine tax regulations and labor rules that make hiring employees costlier than in some rich industrialized countries. In Argentina, dozens of game-developing start-ups have been founded in Buenos Aires.
But while Argentina has traditionally had more companies in the industry, some of the momentum is seen shifting across the border to Uruguay as Argentine ventures struggle with abrupt changes in economic policy, including the tightening of currency controls that have complicated operations for exporters.
In Latin America and beyond, developers are seeking to mimic the success of Kingdom Rush, ranked in 2012 among the top-selling paid applications for the iPhone in the United States. In addition to Ironhide and Powerful Robot, an array of other game developers operates quietly.
Some, like Trojan Chicken, a developer of educational games in Spanish for schoolchildren, benefit from the heavy presence of the state across Uruguay's economy, which avoided the privatization wave of neighboring Latin American countries in the 1990s.
Ingenio, a state-controlled incubator for start-ups, helped finance Trojan Chicken, which has created educational games including 1811, an adventure game set in colonial Uruguay, and D.E.D., a detective game in which players solve thefts of national heritage. The games are designed to be played on the inexpensive laptops distributed to schoolchildren across Uruguay.
Nearly all of the 300,000 children in Uruguay's public schools now have their own computers, after the authorities here began embracing One Laptop per Child, the ambitious project aimed at bringing computing to children in the developing world, in 2006. Called the Plan Ceibal here, it is financed by public money.
Miguel Brechner, the director of the Plan Ceibal, said the initiative was already serving as a catalyst for Uruguayan content developers, notably gaming and animation studios. Describing Ceibal as a ''digital equality plan,'' he said that ''reality has shown that kids get excited about games.''
Encompassing the video game companies, software development in Uruguay has evolved into a $600 million industry, making the country Latin America's leader in per-capita software exports. But some here say that the industry may also be falling victim to its success, as salaries for developers rapidly climb and make it more expensive for start-ups to compete internationally.
Still, Uruguay's immigration laws offer certain advantages in the competition for talented employees. Building on a history of attracting immigrants from Europe, engineers, animators and other foreign hires at start-ups can legally reside and work in Uruguay while their applications for work visas are being processed.
''Uruguay is a remarkably open place when it comes to attracting talent,'' said Evan Henshaw-Plath, an American among the founders of the company that became Twitter. After moving to Uruguay in 2007, Mr. Henshaw-Plath founded a software development company that now has employees from countries like Poland and Ecuador.
Drawing a contrast between Uruguay and Brazil, he delights in telling a story about an American technology investor based in Japan who was about to embark on a business trip to South America aimed at finding start-ups in which to invest or to acquire outright.
Upon discovering that Brazil required Americans to go through a bureaucratic ordeal to obtain a visa, the investor canceled his trip there. Instead, he visited Uruguay, which has no such visa requirements, and eventually acquired Mr. Henshaw-Plath's 20-person company, Cubox.

HEADLINE: Martin Zweig, 70; Forecast '87 Market Crash

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Martin Zweig, an influential investor and television pundit who predicted the 1987 stock market crash, published a closely followed newsletter and in 1999 made what at the time was the most expensive residential purchase in New York history, died on Monday at his home in Fisher Island, Fla. He was 70.
His death was announced by his firm, Zweig-DiMenna Associates. No cause was given. 
On Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, Mr. Zweig made one of his regular appearances on ''Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser,'' but it had been far from a regular week. The stock market had been in a sudden, sharp decline, dropping more than 10 percent.
Early in the program, Mr. Rukeyser turned to Mr. Zweig, an academic who had become an analyst, and asked whether he believed the bull market was dead.
''I haven't been looking for a bear market per se,'' Mr. Zweig responded solemnly. ''I've been really, in my own mind, looking for a crash.''
The following Monday, Oct. 19, the market fell 508 points, a nearly 23 percent decline, to 1,734.78.
Mr. Zweig was not the only analyst to predict the crash -- or that it would be short-lived -- but his appearances on ''Wall Street Week,'' and his history of accurately predicting the market, made him one of the better-known forecasters.
He had published two popular books, ''Winning on Wall Street,'' in 1986 and ''Winning With New IRAs'' early in 1987. The books expanded on methods he used in his newsletter, The Zweig Forecast.
Mark Hulbert, an analyst who tracks the advice and performance of investor newsletters, wrote in a tribute this week that Mr. Zweig ''brought a rigorously empirical and scientific approach to beating the market, which, surprisingly, was not the norm among advisers when he began his career.''
Mr. Hulbert once calculated that over its life span The Zweig Forecast ranked first among newsletters for risk-adjusted performance.
In 1997, Mr. Zweig discontinued the newsletter and successfully focused on mutual funds and money management.
He also made a singular real estate transaction. In 1999 he spent a record $21.5 million to buy the Pierre Penthouse, a multistory apartment at the top of the Pierre Hotel that includes a grand ballroom with sweeping views of Manhattan.
''It was the most important sale in the 20th century,'' Elizabeth Lee Sample, one of the agents involved, said of the deal many years later. ''It is a chateau in the sky.''
Mr. Zweig decorated the apartment with highlights from his extensive collection of cultural memorabilia, including the dress Marilyn Monroe wore when she sang ''Happy Birthday'' to President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, gold records by the Beatles and a Chicago Bulls jersey worn by Michael Jordan.
Mr. Zweig listed the property for sale at $70 million in 2004 but later took it off the market.
Martin Edward Zweig was born on July 2, 1942, in Cleveland. He began trading stocks as a teenager and initially embarked on an academic career. He received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, a master's of business administration from the University of Miami and a doctorate in finance from Michigan State University.
He taught at Baruch College in Manhattan and Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y.
Survivors include his wife, Barbara, and two sons, Zack and Alex.

HEADLINE: As the Competition Heats Up, So Does a Fight Over Homegrown Peppers

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
SANTA FE, N.M. -- Chile peppers are to New Mexico what oranges are to Florida, apples are to Washington and peanuts are to Virginia: a defining source of chest-thumping pride. It is also the state's official vegetable and the reason for such thing as the state's official question -- ''Red or green?''
Chile peppers are a crop under assault, though -- from foreign competitors like Mexico, where harvesting could cost less than one-third of what it costs in New Mexico. Meanwhile, prolific growers in California surpassed the state years ago in the quantity of chile peppers harvested from its fields to become the nation's No. 1 producer, according to statistics from the federal Agriculture Department. 
Farmers have also been facing a vexing challenge on the ground: keeping chile grown outside New Mexico from being sold as homegrown, a deceptive practice that is common and hard to detect.
Charlie Marquez, a lobbyist for the New Mexico Chile Association, described the situation as ''disturbing.'' State Representative Rodolpho S. Martinez, a Democrat whose district encompasses the heart of chile country, stared ahead, rubbed his knuckles and called it an ''outrage.''
Last month, Mr. Martinez introduced a bill to add some teeth to a 2011 law that everyone had hoped would safeguard the status of New Mexico's chiles, but has fallen short. The new bill aims to force out-of-state chile peppers, in their natural and processed forms, to display on their package an unusual disclaimer: ''not grown in New Mexico.''
''It's to guard against impostors, to keep them honest,'' Representative Martinez said on a recent morning.
Protecting New Mexican chile peppers has been a tough battle, in part because not every legislator buys into the idea that the right way to do it is to create more rules. The state, hobbled by a sluggish economic recovery, has also found it difficult to find money to finance new programs.
Representative Martinez's bill passed unanimously in the House Agriculture and Water Resources Committee last month. Then, on Wednesday, it was shelved by an 8-to-7 vote in the House Judiciary Committee after a spirited debate over whether it might be too burdensome for small growers. On Thursday, though, there was already talk that the bill could be resurrected after the committee's chairwoman, Representative Gail Chasey, a Democrat, said, ''It is not necessarily dead.'' An identical bill has already been introduced in the Senate. Washington State trademarked its apples in 1961 and Virginia trademarked its peanuts in 2006. In the late 1980s, under stiff competition from states like Texas and California, Georgia wrote into law exactly what type of seeds and soil would yield its sweet Vidalia onions. A year later, the federal government endorsed the same parameters and the brand was certified in 1990.
Wendy Brannen, executive director of the Vidalia Onion Committee, which handles marketing and research on behalf of growers and packers of Vidalia onions, said that more than protecting the crop, ''the State of Georgia worked hard to build the Vidalia brand.''
New Mexico has opted for a modest and incremental approach. Its 2011 law gave inspectors from the state's Agriculture Department the ability to seek court injunctions against companies that falsely advertise their chile peppers as being from New Mexico by allowing them to inspect stores and audit companies' sales books. Last July, the department began requiring a certificate of authenticity to accompany chile peppers from the field to the point of sale or processing plant. Katie Goetz, the department's spokeswoman, said the most obvious violations found so far have been in red chile pods sold in plastic bags that feature the words ''New Mexico chile,'' as well as ''Hecho en Mexico'' or ''Made in Mexico.''
Under the same bill, Mr. Martinez proposed going after out-of-state chile peppers sold under brands bearing names of cities, counties and other New Mexico localities known for their chile production, like ''Hatch chile,'' named after the southern village that hosts a huge chile festival every year. Its main targets, however, are big chain stores, which he said may not be as diligent as roadside vegetable stands about checking the origin of the products they offer.
''Maintaining our brand is important,'' Representative Martinez said, even if for a declining industry. In 2011, chile peppers were harvested along 9,500 acres of land. Nearly a decade earlier in 1992, harvested fields covered more than 34,000 acres, according to the New Mexico Chile Association.
Mr. Marquez said a chile pepper harvester makes about $90 a day in New Mexico and about $20 in Mexico, which results in a big discrepancy in their sale prices. Still, he went on, ''We're so proud of it, we're willing to pay a premium for New Mexico chile.''
The question, however, is whether the average customer can taste the difference in chile peppers that come from this place or that.
Yes, Mr. Marquez said, ''if you're comparing chile from New Mexico and chile from Colorado.'' But, he conceded, ''30 miles south of the border, in Mexico, they're growing chile that is very similar to ours and the vast majority of people probably couldn't tell them apart.''

HEADLINE: A Titan's How-To on Breaking the Glass Ceiling

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
Before Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, started to write ''Lean In,'' her book-slash-manifesto on women in the workplace, she rereadBetty Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique.'' Like the homemaker turned activist who helped start a revolution 50 years ago, Ms. Sandberg wanted to do far more than sell books.
Ms. Sandberg, whose ideas about working women have prompted both enthusiasm and criticism, is attempting nothing less than a Friedan-like feat: a national discussion of a gender-problem-that-has-no-name, this time in the workplace, and a movement to address it.
When her book is published on March 11, accompanied by a carefully orchestrated media campaign, she hopes to create her own version of the consciousness-raising groups of yore: ''Lean In Circles,'' as she calls them, in which women can share experiences and follow a Sandberg-crafted curriculum for career success. (First assignment: a video on how to command more authority at work by changing how they speak and even sit.) 
In an interview for ''Makers,'' a new documentary on feminist history, Ms. Sandberg, 43, said: ''I always thought I would run a social movement, which meant basically work at a nonprofit. I never thought I'd work in the corporate sector.''
And yet no one knows whether women will show up for Ms. Sandberg's revolution, a top-down affair propelled by a fortune worth hundreds of millions on paper, or whether the social media executive can form a women's network of her own. Only a single test ''Lean In Circle'' exists. With less than three weeks until launch -- which will include a spread in Time magazine and splashy events like a book party at the foundation offices of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- organizers cannot say how many more groups may sprout up.
Even her advisers acknowledge the awkwardness of a woman with double Harvard degrees, dual stock riches (from Facebook and Google, where she also worked), a 9,000-square-foot house and a small army of household help urging less fortunate women to look inward and work harder. Will more earthbound women, struggling with cash flow and child care, embrace the advice of a Silicon Valley executive whose book acknowledgments include thanks to her wealth adviser andOprah Winfrey?
''I don't think anyone has ever tried to do this from anywhere even close to her perch,'' said Debora L. Spar, president of Barnard College, who invited Ms. Sandberg to deliver a May 2011 commencement address about gender in the workplace that caught fire online. (Ms. Sandberg, who will grant her first book interview to the CBS program ''60 Minutes,'' declined to comment for this article.)
Despite decades of efforts, and some visible exceptions, the number of top women leaders in many fields remains stubbornly low: for example, 21 of the current Fortune 500 chief executives are women. In her book, to be published by Knopf, Ms. Sandberg argues that is because women face invisible, even subconscious, barriers in the workplace, and not just from bosses. In her view, women are also sabotaging themselves. ''We hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in,'' she writes, and the result is that ''men still run the world.''
Ms. Sandberg wants to take women through a collective self-awareness exercise. In her book, she urges them to absorb the social science showing they are judged more harshly and paid less than men; resist slowing down in mere anticipation of having children; insist that their husbands split housework equally; draft short- and long-term career plans; and join a ''Lean In Circle,'' which is half business school and half book club.
The project has the feel of a social experiment: what if women at major corporations could review research on how to overcome gender barriers, along with instruction on skills like negotiation and communication? Will working women, already stretched thin, attend nighttime video lectures on ''Unconditional Responsibility'' and ''Using Stories Powerfully''? The instructions for the gatherings, provided to The New York Times by an outside adviser to the project, are precise, down to membership requirements (participants can miss no more than two monthly meetings per year) and the format (15-minute check-in, 3 minutes each for personal updates, a 90-minute presentation, then discussion).
Ms. Sandberg has asked a wide array of women to contribute their success stories to her new Web site. (Jill Abramson, the executive editor of The Times, wrote an essay, and the newspaper is one of many corporations to sign on to the project.) The written requests ask for positive endings, suggesting that tales closing with missed promotions or broken marriages are unwelcome. Hoping to reach beyond an elite audience, Ms. Sandberg and her foundation joined forces with Cosmopolitan magazine, which is publishing a 40-page supplement to its April issue devoted to Ms. Sandberg's ideas, and plan to spread her message to community colleges, according to those involved in the project.
But criticism is also starting to build: that Ms. Sandberg places too much of the onus on women who are already struggling to fulfill impossible demands, and too little on government and employers to provide better child care, more flexible jobs and other concrete gains.
Ms. Sandberg ''does what too many successful women before her have done: blaming other women for not trying hard enough,'' wrote Avivah Wittenberg-Cox, a consultant who works with companies to improve their gender balance, after watching a video of Ms. Sandberg speaking on the topic at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. ''Every resistant man on the planet will be able to quote her'' saying that women simply must become more ambitious, Ms. Cox continued. (Ms. Sandberg writes that she focuses on internal barriers because the external ones get more attention.)
Ms. Sandberg's project, according to members of her launch committee and their solicitations, asks little of the corporations signing on as ''launch partners,'' which include American Express, Google, Sony, Johnson & Johnson and multiple media businesses. Mostly they are asked to lend their logo to Lean In and distribute its materials to employees. In exchange, they will get recognition for supporting the Lean In cause, the solicitation says.
Ms. Sandberg's chief critic has been Anne-Marie Slaughter, a Princeton professor and former top State Department official, who published an Atlantic Magazine article titled ''Why Women Can't Have It All,'' last year arguing that feminism -- and Ms. Sandberg -- were holding women to unattainable standards for personal and professional success.
Since then, both women quietly developed perhaps the most notable feminist row since Ms. Friedan refused to shakeGloria Steinem's hand decades ago.
According to several people who have spoken to both women, Ms. Sandberg felt blindsided by Ms. Slaughter's criticisms, and though they briefly exchanged e-mails, Ms. Sandberg stopped replying and refused joint speaking appearances. Ms. Slaughter continued her commentary: ''Sheryl Sandberg is both superhuman and rich,'' she told Fortune magazine, implying that her advice makes little sense for anyone who is not.
''She's made a real contribution with the book, but it's only half the story,'' Ms. Slaughter said in an interview.
The Slaughter-Sandberg match may represent what some may see as a welcome new phase in the debate over work and motherhood. The ''mommy wars,'' with working and stay-at-home mothers sniping at one another's choices, may have finally run their course. Instead, Ms. Sandberg, Ms. Slaughter and many others are arguing about the best strategy for fulfilling feminism's promise. ''If you tell women to look inside themselves, you're letting the corporations and government off the hook,'' said Ms. Spar, the Barnard president, and ''if you focus on the corporations and the governments, you're not being realistic.''
Ms. Sandberg, who wrote a senior thesis at Harvard about domestic violence and women's income, and who has championed women at Google and Facebook, shows no sign of relenting. On top of running a major company and rearing two young children -- her husband, Dave Goldberg, is chief executive of SurveyMonkey, a technology company -- she has thrown herself into her new project.
Though she insists she is committed to Facebook, which might be awkward for her to leave given its rocky initial public offering, some wonder whether ''Lean In'' is the first step toward a new career for her, perhaps in politics.
''She is using all of her social capital on this,'' said Rachel Sklar, founder of a networking list for women in technology, who is on the Lean In launch committee. Asked how Ms. Sandberg would balance her demanding job with the creation of a new movement, a member of the team offered a tentative answer: she plans to use her vacation days.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 27, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
An entry in the Spare Times listings in some editions on Friday about a discussion of Massimo Vignelli's subway map on Tuesday at the New York Transit Museum, in Brooklyn Heights, misidentified the designer of a subway map used by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The map now on subway trains is a 1979 design, with some modifications, by Michael Hertz, not by Mr. Vignelli. (A reconfiguration of a 1972 design by Mr. Vignelli is available on the mta.info/weekender Web site and app.)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: 'DR. DuBOIS AND MISS OVINGTON': (Friday through Sunday) United in their outrage over racial inequality in 19th-century America, the activists W.E.B. DuBois and Mary White Ovington -- a black man from Massachusetts and a white woman from Brooklyn -- fought for equal rights for all and were among the founders of the organization that would become the N.A.A.C.P. They were also friends. Their complex relationship is explored in this two-character play by Clare Coss at the Castillo Theater, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton. It is the last in a trilogy of plays celebrating black history month presented by Woodie King Jr.'s National Black Touring Circuit
two earlier shows focused on Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the longtime New York City councilman and congressman who died in 1972, and Frederick Douglass, the 19th-century social reformer and abolitionist.

Performances are on Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m.

HEADLINE: The Case for a Higher Gasoline Tax

BYLINE: By VALERIE J. KARPLUS. 
Valerie J. Karplus is a research scientist in the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at M.I.T.

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
THE average price of gasoline in the United States, $3.78 on Thursday, has been steadily climbing for more than a month and is approaching the three previous post-recession peaks, in May 2011 and in April and September of last year. 
But if our goal is to get Americans to drive less and use more fuel-efficient vehicles, and to reduce air pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases, gas prices need to be even higher. The current federal gasoline tax, 18.4 cents a gallon, has been essentially stable since 1993; in inflation-adjusted terms, it's fallen by 40 percent since then.
Politicians of both parties understandably fear that raising the gas tax would enrage voters. It certainly wouldn't make lives easier for struggling families. But the gasoline tax is a tool of energy and transportation policy, not social policy, like the minimum wage.
Instead of penalizing gasoline use, however, the Obama administration chose a familiar and politically easier path: raising fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. The White House said last year that the gas savings would be comparable to lowering the price of gasoline by $1 a gallon by 2025. But it will have no effect on the 230 million passenger vehicles now on the road.
Greater efficiency packs less of a psychological punch because consumers pay more only when they buy a new car. In contrast, motorists are reminded regularly of the price at the pump. But the new fuel-efficiency standards are far less efficient than raising gasoline prices.
In a paper published online this week in the journal Energy Economics, I and other scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimate that the new standards will cost the economy on the whole -- for the same reduction in gas use -- at least six times more than a federal gas tax of roughly 45 cents per dollar of gasoline. That is because a gas tax provides immediate, direct incentives for drivers to reduce gasoline use, while the efficiency standards must squeeze the reduction out of new vehicles only. The new standards also encourage more driving, not less.
Other industrialized democracies have accepted much higher gas taxes as a price for roads and bridges and now depend on the revenue. In fact, Germany's gas tax is 18 times higher than the United States' (and seven times more if the average state gas tax is included). The federal gasoline tax contributed about $25 billion in revenues in 2009.
Raising the tax has generally succeeded only when it was sold as a way to lower the deficit or improve infrastructure or both. A 1-cent federal gasoline tax was created in 1932, during the Depression. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan raised the tax to 9 cents from 4 cents, calling it a ''user fee'' to finance transportation improvements. The tax rose again, to 14.1 cents in 1990, and to 18.4 cents in 1993, as part of deficit-reduction deals under President George Bush and President Bill Clinton.
A higher gas tax would help fix crumbling highways while also generating money that could help offset the impact on low- and middle-income families. Increasing the tax, as part of a bipartisan budget deal, with a clear explanation to the public of its role in lowering oil imports and improving our air and highways, could be among the most important energy decisions we make.

HEADLINE: General Electric Chief Remains Cautiously Optimistic About India

BYLINE: GARDINER HARRIS


HIGHLIGHT: G.E. continues to invest in India and business will grow, Jeffrey R. Immelt predicts. 

 BODY:
NEW DELHI - On a visit to India, the head of one of the world's largest companies painted a fairly optimistic portrait of India's growth prospects, although he hinted that Indian policy makers had reasons for concern. 
Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, said Friday that G.E. was investing nearly $200 million in a manufacturing facility in Pune and another $75 million in a research and development site in Bangalore. He said that he expected both facilities to grow smartly in the coming years.
"We think Pune could be a big facility because the demand here is so big," he said. "Our revenue here should grow between 15 and 20 percent annually on a sustainable basis."
He said he was very optimistic about the company's medical products business in India.
"The doctors here are driving us to be innovative," he said. "Every doctor in India is an entrepreneur. You have an incredibly entrepreneurial medical culture here because the system has grown up in a different way."
But if India is to experience the kind of economic growth that has propelled China over the past two decades, it is likely to need large manufacturers like General Electric to use its operations in India to make products not just for the domestic market but for buyers around the globe. And on that score, Mr. Immelt was far from encouraging.
"If we manufacture something here, we manufacture it because it could be used in South Asia," he said. "The United States is very competitive today."
He went on to say that when it comes to costs, "everyone has to be a little paranoid because the absolute difference becomes narrower everywhere."
India's relatively low labor costs are becoming less strategically important from a business investment standpoint, he said. Labor costs play a fairly minor role in the overall production costs for most of General Electric's products, he said, and power costs have dropped sharply in the United States in recent years.
Mr. Immelt said he was not overly concerned about recent tax-law changes, worries over India's fiscal deficit or what he termed "a steady drumbeat of what I would say was some fairly negative news" about India. He complimented Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram as "being known to all of us around the world, and he's quite well-respected."
"I already see signs of a correction," he said. "Progress will be made. Maybe not in a straight-line fashion, but it will be made."

HEADLINE: Banning Corzine Proves Problematic

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The National Futures Association faced an obstacle in considering a lifetime ban for Jon S. Corzine: he isn&#8217;t a member. | Citigroup, a closely watched player in the debate over Wall Street compensation, is changing how it calculates bonuses for top executives. | David Einhorn has a name for the preferred shares he wants Apple to give to shareholders: iPrefs. | Europe thinks it has found a way to keep firms from avoiding a proposed tax on financial transactions. 

 BODY:
BANNING CORZINE PROVES PROBLEMATIC | The National Futures Association, the self-regulatory group for the futures industry, faced an obstacle in considering a lifetime ban for Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic senator who ran the now-defunct MF Global: Mr. Corzine isn't a member, DealBook's Ben Protess writes.
The group convened on Thursday with two of its board members pushing for a ban of Mr. Corzine as punishment for his role in the demise of MF Global, which improperly used customer money. Mr. Corzine's lack of membership wasn't the only stumbling block. The group's chairman said in a statement that the board "does not wish to take any action that could interfere" with "ongoing investigations concerning Mr. Corzine's activities at MF Global." Once the investigations wrap up, "N.F.A. has the authority to bring disciplinary action against Mr. Corzine for violations of any N.F.A. rules that occurred while he was a member," said the chairman, Christopher Hehmeyer. 
"A ban from the futures association would have amounted to little more than a wrist slap to someone like Mr. Corzine, who once ran Goldman Sachs and served as a senator from New Jersey," Mr. Protess reported. "Still, the move would have complicated any future plans he might have to open a trading firm. And if Mr. Corzine decides to one day rejoin the industry, he could face an unfriendly welcome."
CITIGROUP TOUGHENS RULES ON BONUSES | Citigroup, a closely watched player in the debate over Wall Street compensation, is changing how it calculates bonuses for top executives. The bank announced on Thursday that part of the $11.5 million pay package awarded to Michael L. Corbat, the chief executive, would be closely tied to performance. "So far, though, the changes are only affecting a small portion of Citigroup's executive compensation packages without reining in the big bonuses that have become one of the hallmarks of Wall Street," The New York Times's Nathaniel Popper and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report.
Michael O'Neill, the bank's powerful chairman, said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that the committee on executive pay had come up with its new formula after meeting with investors representing more than 30 percent of the bank's outstanding shares. Part of the new pay packages will be tied to the bank's performance relative to rivals. For 2012, Mr. Corbat was awarded $3.1 million in performance share units, 27 percent of his total pay.
The change comes less than a year after shareholders opposed a pay package for the previous chief, Vikram S. Pandit. "When our shareholders spoke last year about Citi's compensation structure, we listened," Mr. O'Neill said in the filing. Still, Nell Minow, a shareholder advocate at GMI Ratings, said the new approach was "far from perfect, or even good, but it's less terrible than it used to be."
EINHORN INTRODUCES 'IPREFS' | David Einhorn has a name for the preferred shares he wants Apple to give to shareholders: iPrefs. The hedge fund manager, outlining on Thursday his strategy for encouraging Apple to return some cash to shareholders, said the class of perpetual perfered shares could produce $61 a share in additional benefits for investors. Apple could issue one preferred share, with a quarterly dividend of 50 cents each, for each outstanding common share. "We know they embrace innovation and can recognize it when they see it, even if it isn't the kind of innovation people usually think of when they think of Apple," said Mr. Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital.
Still, some investors in Apple have called on Mr. Einhorn to stop his fight, which involves a lawsuit over a vote on shareholder initiatives. "I came off the call deeply puzzled," Anne Simpson, the director of global governance for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, told DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced.
While discussing Apple, Mr. Einhorn also criticized Dell, which received a controversial buyout offer. "Dell's go-private effort shows the disingenuous nature of hoarding cash," he said.
ON THE AGENDA | The European Commission publishes new forecasts for the euro zone economy. After Hewlett-Packard reported lower revenue in the first quarter, Meg Whitman, the chief executive, appears on CNBC at 9 a.m. James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, is on CNBC at 7 a.m.
TRADING TAX MAY TAKE EFFECT IN EUROPE | "To the dismay of the United States government - not to mention Wall Street - much of Europe seems poised to begin taxing financial trading as soon as next year," Floyd Norris, a columnist for The New York Times, writes. Arguments against the tax, including the idea that it would drive trading to other countries, "have not proved persuasive in Europe, which thinks it has found a way to keep institutions from avoiding the tax. If Europe proves to be correct, it could turn out to be a seminal moment in the relation of governments to large financial institutions. The tax would be tiny for investors who buy and hold, but could prove to be significant for traders who place millions of orders a day."

HEADLINE: Critical Differences Belie Hopes for a Grand Bargain

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: As the latest fiscal deadline approaches the White House is signaling that it is still interested in a big deficit-reduction deal and as evidence of good faith has left on the table proposed Medicare and Social Security cuts that liberals hate. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Even as President Obama lashes out at Republicans over the automatic spending cuts that take effect next week, he is simultaneously sending them a strikingly different message: he is still interested in a big deficit-reduction deal and as evidence of his good faith has left on the table proposed Medicare and Social Security cuts that liberals hate.
With neither side making much effort to avert the across-the-board reductions in military and domestic programs that kick in next Friday, signals from the White House about a much more ambitious budget package might seem to be somewhere between delusional and beside the point - not to mention politically self-serving. On Capitol Hill, Republicans say Mr. Obama has actually backtracked from where he was 18 months ago on reining in the entitlement programs and has shown no willingness to do anything really hard to get the nation's long-term debt problems under control.
But administration officials say that some kind of opportunity is likely to present itself this year to engage Congressional Republicans on a comprehensive plan. In addition to rebutting Republican claims that he has no plan of his own, Mr. Obama wants to make clear to Republicans, aides said, that even after the failure of successive negotiations he remains willing to make difficult concessions. 
That is especially true, they said, when it comes to entitlement programs, the focus of the sharpest ideological clashes between the two parties and the biggest contributors to the long-term budget imbalances. 
His aides point to Mr. Obama's continued willingness to swallow, over the intensifying objections of most of the left side of his party, a new way of calculating inflation adjustments for Social Security benefits that would reduce the growth of payments - in effect, a benefit cut. And Mr. Obama has alluded repeatedly to his willingness to re-engage with Republicans based on his last offer for $400 billion in Medicare cuts, made during the negotiations in December over the so-called fiscal cliff; that's a level that gives heartburn to some Democrats in Congress who see no need to compromise at this point.
"That offer is out there for them to accept anytime they want to take it, and it carries some considerable cost to us," said Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama's senior adviser. "I'm not sure what more we could do to show we're serious."
The continued maneuvering reflects a calculation inside the White House that there is still a path to a legacy-enhancing budget deal, notwithstanding Speaker John A. Boehner's pledge not to allow any tax increases or engage in closed-door negotiations with the president.
The starting point, administration officials say, is to allow the normal budget process to play out in Congress in coming months, while encouraging both parties to explore ideas for overhauling the tax code. At some point the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House could begin to consider areas for compromise, providing a natural forum for a negotiation in which Mr. Obama would not necessarily need to be the central player.
To the degree that an improving economy and signs of a reduced rate of growth in health care costs push projected budget deficits lower, the climate for a deal could also brighten.
But that optimistic view of the possibilities ignores the deep differences between the parties, not only on taxes, the most obvious sticking point, but also on entitlement programs, where Democrats and Republicans have such profoundly different viewpoints about what needs to be done that a deal would require one or the other of them to budge in a fundamental way.
While Mr. Obama clearly sees his offer on entitlements as a way to build trust with Republicans, many conservatives see it as evidence that they will never reach an accord because they define the problem in such different ways.
Mr. Obama sees the challenge of Medicare largely as a matter of reducing federal outlays for the existing system by limiting payments to providers and better employing the government's purchasing power; many Republicans see the current system as unsustainable given the growing costs of an aging population and are seeking to rebuild Medicare in a way that injects far more market competition into health care. The mechanism preferred by conservatives in recent years has been the so-called "premium support" model, in which Medicare beneficiaries would receive a check from the government to purchase their own policies or regular Medicare coverage - the approach championed by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the party's vice-presidential nominee last year.
In other words, where Mr. Obama sees dealing with Medicare as mostly a matter of math, Republicans see it as a matter of ideology.
"Republicans and Democrats are not just talking about differences of degree," said Yuval Levin, an informal adviser to Mr. Ryan and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative research group. "They are talking about differences of direction."
Inside the White House, there is deep skepticism about whether Republicans actually want to address Medicare in an immediate and concrete way - or whether Republicans would prefer to pillory Democrats for backing Medicare cuts, as they did successfully in the 2010 midterm elections and could again in 2014, and avoid voting for anything themselves that could bring a backlash from voters. The most recent version of Mr. Ryan's plan, for example, would make no changes to Medicare for a decade.
Whether in dealing with the automatic budget cuts or the longer-term issues, the lack of trust between the two sides remains almost complete. To talk successively to senior administration officials and top Republican aides on Capitol Hill this week about the fiscal-policy climate is to be plunged back into bitterly competing narratives about how the other side is unable to stand up to its base, unwilling to give any ground and more interested in turning the politics to its advantage than doing what is right for the country.
"The menu of entitlement reform options discussed over the last two years is the bare minimum necessary to start solving our long-term debt crisis," said Kevin Smith, communications director for Mr. Boehner. "And the fact that this president is backpedaling on key reforms rather than showing the courage to take on his own party is not a promising sign."
At the White House, they say they do not get enough credit from Republicans for bucking the Democratic Party's liberal base by supporting the cuts to Social Security's cost-of-living adjustments. They also point to their willingness to embrace substantial Medicare cuts that would put some Democratic members of Congress at risk in their next elections.
Republicans are especially dismissive of Mr. Obama's outreach on the entitlement programs. They say that in the summer of 2011 the president was willing to consider increasing the age for Medicare eligibility but has subsequently backed away from that position under pressure from liberals in what Republicans interpret as a sign of unwillingness at the White House to take on anything other than relatively easy cuts to health care providers.
"There has been no leadership from the White House and Senate majority to pursue structural reforms to those programs," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, "despite the importance of saving Medicare and Medicaid for future generations."

HEADLINE: More Swiss Myths

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: I wasn&#8217;t hard enough on those guys. 

 BODY:
Oh, boy - it turns out that I, too, wasn't nearly hard enough on Holtz-Eakin and Roy's health care op-ed. In praising the allegedly more free-market Swiss system, they declare: 
While most Americans view their healthcare system as "free-market," Switzerland actually has the most market-oriented healthcare system in the West. It translates into universal coverage and low entitlement costs. Swiss government entities spent about 3.5 percent of gross domestic product on healthcare in 2010, compared to 8.5 percent in the United States. That's a difference of more than $5 trillion over 10 years: real money, especially relative to our $16 trillion debt.
OK, I don't know what spending by "government entities" means - but the OECD offers standard data on public and private health care expenditure; according to these data, America does indeed have public spending of 8.5 percent of GDP - but the Swiss number is 7.4 percent. This isn't an obscure source, it's where everyone goes for the numbers. Something is very wrong here.
More generally, comparing public spending and calling lower public spending a "saving" is deeply wrong when it comes to health care, where some countries simply pay for health care out of public funds, while others use a combination of regulation and subsidies to achieve similar result, but with lower on-budget outlays. Here's how I do the comparison when I teach it. First, a single payer system:
Here all of the spending shows up in the government budget.
Next, ObamaRomneycare (or, actually, the Swiss system), in which everyone is obliged to buy insurance, but the government subsidizes premiums for lower-income families:
Here only the subsidy component shows up in the government's budget - but the two systems produce pretty much the same results. Oh, and ObamaRomneycare doesn't save money relative to single payer - it just arranges that much of the cost takes the form of premiums rather than taxes.
Look, I know that we're supposed to be celebrating people like Holtz-Eakin and Roy for showing more intellectual flexibility than the rest of their party. But I guess I find it hard to be encouraged when the supposed show of flexibility leads with grossly false and/or misleading numbers.

HEADLINE: National Parks on a Precipice

BYLINE: LESLIE MACMILLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Absent a Congressional compromise to avert budget cuts, services will be significantly reduced starting March 1, park retirees warn. 

 BODY:
Unless Congress can reach a budget agreement by March 1, the country's national parks will be hit by a $110 million budget cut, resulting in shuttered campgrounds, shorter seasons, road closings and reduced emergency services, a parks advocacy group reports.
Great Smoky Mountains National Park will close four campgrounds. The Grand Canyon National Park will shorten visitor center hours at the South Rim. Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts will close its visitors center and restrict access to large sections of the Great Beach. And Yosemite and Yellowstone will delay summer road openings up to four weeks, according to the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, which said it obtained the details from sources in the park service. 
Jeffrey Olson, a National Park Service spokesman, confirmed that the information in the coalition's statement was accurate. "We hope it doesn't come to pass," he said. 
The park service itself has warned that the public should be prepared for reduced hours and services, including the "closing of camping, hiking and other recreational areas when there is insufficient staff to ensure the protection of visitors, employees, and historic, cultural and natural resources."

Park advocates like the coalition of former employees are urging Congress to prevent the cuts, which it estimates would slice 5 percent from the park service's $2.2 billion budget. 
Joan Anzelmo, a spokeswoman for the retirees group, pointed out that America's 398 national parks and monuments attract 280 million visitors a year, and that consumer spending at the parks supports 247,000 jobs and yields a $31 billion economic impact. "Congress should be strategic, and if you're going to be strategic, you don't cut the revenue generators," she said.
Beyond providing revenue, she said, visitors "have a deep, emotional connection to the parks. They're our heritage. But if we relied on today's Congress, there would be no Yellowstone, there would be no Grand Canyon, because they can't put aside their partisan differences to get their job done."
Any entity that receives federal money, like school districts and military bases, is subject to the automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration. The former park employees say that the effects would be severe because the cuts would be made over the seven remaining months of the 2013 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. 
Chuck Neal, a retired ecologist with the Interior Department, which oversees the park service, said he worried that reduced staffing at the parks could "open opportunities for local, hooligan-types to create some mischief, such as poaching and harassing wildlife."
More broadly, conservationists see the looming cuts as part of a worrisome trend that undervalues natural resources like parks. "That trend has been in the works for some time, starting with Reagan," Mr. Neal said. In his view, President Obama has not reversed it.
State and local officials also worry about the impact on their economies. Tourism is the "No. 2 industry in Wyoming, and Yellowstone is a big part of that," said Renny MacKay, a spokesman for Gov. Matt Mead of Wyoming.
Rick Howe, director of visitor services at the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce, said that businesses in communities adjacent to Yellowstone were working with the state on contingency plans. He declined to offer specifics on whether, for example, state money could be used to plow park roads so that they opened on schedule.
Ms. Anzelmo said the coalition released the details of how the cuts would affect the parks to alert the public and to send a message to Congress. "This is America. Come on, run the country," she said.
An earlier version of this post included an incorrect given name for the governor of Wyoming. It is Matt Mead, not Mike.

HEADLINE: Postal Service Revs Up Another Automotive Stamp Issue

BYLINE: MATTHEW HEALEY


HIGHLIGHT: Five new postage stamps feature American muscle cars of the 1960s and &#8217;70s. 

 BODY:
Though the leaky, sputtering Postal Service may seem as broken down as Detroit's Big Three during the financial crisis, our post office's love affair with classic American automobiles keeps roaring along with a healthy enthusiasm.
A snazzy new set of first-class postage stamps goes on sale Friday, just ahead of this weekend's Daytona 500 race. Each of the five new designs, based on paintings commissioned by the Postal Service from Tom Fritz, a California car artist, will feature a different muscle car of the 1960s and '70s.
The stamps join previous sets in the service's "America on the Move" theme: '50s Sporty Cars, issued in 2005, and '50s Fins and Chrome from 2008. 
The new stamps' artwork conveys the energy and excitement of the muscle cars, in spite of their tiny format:
 In Mr. Fritz's depiction, the 1966 Pontiac GTO appears to come roaring out of a great fireball, like some automotive Prometheus: This car is usually considered the beast that began the muscle car craze. With a sedan's 389-cubic inch, 335-horsepower V-8 engine dropped into the midsize body of a Tempest LeMans, the "Goat" had power: It could go from 0-60 m.p.h. in 6.8 seconds. It also had the curvy styling to catch the attention of boomers just old enough to start buying cars.
 The icy blues of the second stamp underscore the timeless cool of the carmaker and former racecar driver Carroll Shelby's 1967 reimagining of the Ford Mustang. The Shelby GT500 included a 428-cubic inch, 355-horsepower police-car engine and racy features like a rear spoiler, scooped fiberglass hood and grille-mounted headlights. The car has been a staple of pop culture, appearing in movies and magazines for decades despite that just over 2,000 were built.
 The first thing one notices on the inch-high image of the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona is its two-foot tall, rear-mounted wing. Excess seemed to be the norm with this car, which took the checkered flag in its Nascar debut at Talladega the year it was released. The production 440-cubic inch, 375-horsepower Magnum engine was so strong the car had to undergo wind-tunnel testing before it could be sold. Concealed headlights and an 18-inch nose piece also aided the aerodynamics and probably helped Buddy Baker become the first Nascar driver to break the 200-m.p.h. barrier. Only 503 Daytonas were made, barely qualifying the car for Nascar racing.
 The 1970 Chevelle SS, or Super Sport, came with a couple of different engine configurations. The 454-cubic inch, 450-horsepower LS-6 version was legendary for its power and allowed the car to run a quarter-mile test in about 13 seconds. On the new stamp, the lipstick-red convertible with slick black racing stripes is the only car whose driver we can see - a woman with flowing hair as cool as the air flowing into the engine cowls.
 Finishing out the set is the 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda, designed to project power not only through its monstrous 426-cubic inch, 425-horsepower Hemi engine and amped-up noise - the Shaker head scoop vibrated as air flowed through - but in the aggressive colors offered. The stamp depicts a vivid hue that's probably the one they called Lime Light. One promo declared the car "the angriest, slipperiest-looking body shell wrapped around ol' King Kong hisself." It's a lonesome breed: fewer than 700 were made.
The Nascar champion Richard Petty and his son Kyle, a muscle-car enthusiast, will play host to the first-day-of-issue ceremony on Friday. The stamps, which sell for the first-class rate of 46 cents, are marked "Forever" to indicate they'll be valid to mail a first-class letter at any time in the future, regardless of rate increases. They're printed in sheets of 20 - four of each design - and will be at post offices nationwide for a limited time.
Collectors interested in obtaining souvenir items, like framed artwork or envelopes bearing a special first-day-of-issue postmark, can order online at store.usps.com.

HEADLINE: Predicting a Crisis, Repeatedly

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A paper by four economists is the latest to predict that the growing United States government debt burden is unsustainable. 

 BODY:
Economists are not very good at predicting crises, but the problem is generally an absence of warnings. It's not easy to anticipate which low-probability catastrophe will end up happening.
That clearly won't be the problem if the United States has a debt crisis. Here we have the opposite phenomenon: a possible crisis that economists love to predict.
The chart below, from a paper presented Friday morning at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York, shows one such warning. The green line, labeled CBO Projections, shows the relatively sanguine expectation of the Congressional Budget Office about the average interest rate that investors will demand on federal debt as the debt rises in coming decades. 
The purple, upwardly mobile line shows the average interest rate that the authors project that investors will demand. Suffice it to say that such an outcome is unsustainable.
The authors, two professors and two market economists, compared interest rates on the sovereign debt of 20 developed nations with the size of those debts in comparison to their gross domestic product, and with each nation's current-account surpluses or deficits. 
The headline conclusion: A one-percentage-point increase in debt as a share of gross domestic product increases 10-year borrowing costs by 4.5 basis points. That means an additional $450,000 in annual interest payments on every $1 billion in debt.

Secondly, a one-percentage-point increase in the current-account deficit raises borrowing costs by 18 basis points, or $1.8 million in interest on every $1 billion in debt.
Third, the penalties increase at higher debt levels, and the increases are not linear. In other words, debt levels can cross thresholds that lead investors to demand significantly higher interest rates, and once that kind of cycle begins, it can be very hard to escape.
Where is the line? "Countries with debt above 80 percent of G.D.P. and persistent current-account deficits are vulnerable to a rapid fiscal deterioration as a result of these tipping-point dynamics," write David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley; James D. Hamilton, a professor at the University of California, San Diego; Peter Hooper, an economist at Deutsche Bank Securities; and Frederic S. Mishkin, a professor at Columbia University. The paper was presented at a conference convened by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
This is bad news for the United States because, as it happens, the national debt is 80 percent of annual economic output, the nation has a persistent current-account deficit, and it is planning to significantly increase the scale of borrowing, relative to output, in coming decades.
A host of other studies have reached similar conclusions. The estimated thresholds range from about 60 percent to 120 percent, but the bottom line is always the same: the federal debt cannot continue to grow relative to the size of the economy, or else investors will start demanding much higher interest rates and the United States will fall into crisis.
"We should be scared," said Professor Mishkin, a former Federal Reserve governor. "Something needs to be done," he added, although he acknowledged there was no sign of crisis just yet.
This is undoubtedly true in an absolute sense. But there are reasons to doubt the basic premise that the history of other nations can tell us how close we are to the cliff.
The problem with every attempt to look for debt limit thresholds has a name, and that name is Japan, a country that is able to borrow at one of the lowest average interest rates of any developed country despite a debt burden that is the largest, relative to its economic output, of any developed country. Nor is this an ephemeral anomaly. It has been true for years.
Japan's debts total about 230 percent of its annual output, and so far, investors don't mind.
In part, the authors address this in the traditional manner, by lopping off 5 percent of their 20-nation sample and simply declaring, "There is something very special about Japan."
This is quite possibly true. But because there are not very many developed countries - in this study Japan is just one of 20 - it also might cause a reader to wonder about the universality of any rules derived from the remaining 19 cases, particularly since half of the remaining sample share a currency and an economic union. They are not exactly independent variables.
Furthermore, it's quite possible that the United States also is something of a special case.
Which brings us to the more important acknowledgment, buried deep in the paper: 80 percent is not a magic number. It's not even a particularly good summary of past experience. Rather, it's an average of widely divergent experiences. And it doesn't necessarily tell us much more than common sense: countries with more debt run greater risks of losing the confidence of investors, and have less flexibility to deal with new economic problems. 
"We don't know where the tipping point is," Jerome H. Powell, a Federal Reserve governor, said in a response to the paper. But, he continued, "Wherever it is, we're getting closer to it."

HEADLINE: Deciding Whether to Dip a Toe in the Market

BYLINE: BUCKS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Bucks readers discuss their investing strategy and their views about the stock market. 

 BODY:
Paul Sullivan, in his Wealth Matters column this week, writes about all the reasons - and there are always reasons - that investors decide not to invest in the stock market. He names a few in his column, among them the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and the Asian financial crisis in 1997, from a list compiled by Bel Air Investment Advisors for every year from 1934 to 2012. 
But over that 78-year period, Paul writes, stocks went up by an annual compounded rate of 10.59 percent.
So what to do? There are certainly reasons not to put money in stocks at the moment, starting with the standoff in Washington over the budget and the economic slowdown in Europe.
But financial advisers told Paul that while they did not advocate people putting all their money into stocks, they did suggest that some money go there. Diversification, in other words. And they recommend that people look at their returns over the long term, not just how their investments will do in the next month or so.
What are you doing? Are you putting some of your money back into the stock market? Or have you chosen another course? Tell us about your investing strategy.

HEADLINE: Europe's Example

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ


HIGHLIGHT: Anyone who thinks the sequester won&#8217;t hurt the economy should study the impact of austerity on the euro zone. 

 BODY:
Analysts and lawmakers in Washington who are shrugging off the economic impact of the sequester - the $85 billion reduction in discretionary spending starting on March 1 - should direct their attention to Europe. Countries on the continent have been raising taxes and slashing budgets in a misguided effort to cut their deficits and revive their economies. For all their pains, however, what they are getting is a more prolonged recession. 
On Friday, the European Commission said it now expects the economy of the euro zone to shrink by 0.3 percent this year, following a 0.6 percent decline in 2012. Furthermore, policy makers say they believe that the "risks to the growth outlook are still predominantly to the downside." In other words, they believe that the economy could do even more poorly than they anticipate right now. As recently as November, European policy makers were predicting that the euro zone would grow 0.1 percent in 2013.

The malaise is not just a statistical phenomenon. The unemployment rate in the euro zone is expected to climb to 12.2 percent in the euro zone in 2013 and stay at about that level in 2014; the rate was 11.4 percent in 2012. Greek workers were back out on the streets of Athens this week protesting austerity policies that have driven the unemployment rate to 27 percent in that country.
There is no question that the United States is on much sounder economic footing than the troubled euro zone. But it is not impervious to spending cuts and tax increases. For instance, Wal-Mart and Burger King have lowered sales forecasts to account for the recent rise in the payroll tax. (The 2009 stimulus package decreased the tax to bolster consumer spending. During fiscal cliff negotiations, lawmakers elected not to stop an automatic, 2 percentage point hike.)
The payroll tax cut, which helped the poor and the middle class most because they have less disposable income, had to end at some point. And Congress eventually will have to tackle the long-run budget deficit. It's just that now is not the time to practice austerity. Cutting spending and raising taxes in the middle of a weak economic recovery will reduce growth, making it more difficult to balance the budget, not to mention put millions of people back to work. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the economy will grow at 1.5 percent this year - or half of the expected level without recent tax increases and the coming spending cuts - while the unemployment rate will remain above 7.5 percent through 2014.

HEADLINE: Exploring Climate Resilience and Energy Sense

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Adaption to heat is a prime imperative even as the much tougher task of moving beyond conventional use of fossil fuels is pursued. 

 BODY:
I visited Los Angeles this week to discuss new approaches to environmental communication with students and faculty at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability of the University of California, Los Angeles. I also joined two of the university's professors - the climate scientist Alex Hall and the environmental historian Jon Christensen - for an onstage Zócalo Public Square discussion of this question: "Should we just adapt to climate change?" (The answer of course is...drumroll...no.)
I encourage you to watch the conversation above. I've had time to transcribe a few sections, which are appended below, but wanted first to summarize an important point made by Hall, who has been using models to project regional temperature shifts for the Los Angeles region. 
Hall said that by mid-century the region may see 4 to 5 degrees F. of warming - as well as more frequent stretches of dangerously hot summer days - under a "business as usual" emissions trajectory. But even in an idealized (i.e., impossible) future in which worldwide greenhouse-gas emissions were somehow deeply curtailed, the city would still see 70 percent of that warming. Only late in the century would the unabated gas buildup cause a much bigger regional heating.
A central take-home message, he said (and I agreed), is that adaptation to heat is a prime imperative even as the much tougher task of moving beyond conventional use of fossil fuels is pursued.
There were great questions on a host of fronts, with several attendees focusing on oil - both through the debate over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline and the growing recognition that California, which for a century has been an oil producer, is poised for a huge expansion of drilling for both oil and natural gas in the state's Monterey shale deposits.
Here's part of what I said on Keystone: 
On the Keystone fight, essentially I've been saying - not quite to the extent Joe Nocera said in The Times a couple of days ago when he called the protests "boneheaded," which I think was not productive - I have been among those who've said you look at the global oil market and you realize that as long as the oil price is somewhere around $100 a barrel we will be going to the ends of the Earth the dirtiest possible places, to get the last drop. Of course now we won't have to because California is going to be the next shale oil bonanza. [There were boos, and I stressed I was merely noting the reality, not endorsing it.] Maybe the Alberta tar sands won't look so attractive. What I'm saying is it's high demand that drives the oil-extraction imperative. Until you start to do the things we've been talking about to cut demand, you can blockade a certain pipeline or whatever but that oil will out.... It'll be Nigeria or the Arctic if it's not Alberta. So that gets me in trouble. So there's a lot of yelling. The whole climate debate for years has been this yelling match. "Yelling Fire on a Hot Planet," remember the piece I wrote in 2006.
As I did the other day, I described the excitement surrounding an engineering contest I judged this week in which middle-school students from around the country presented their sustainable and energy-smart urban designs:
On Monday, I was in Washington, D.C., at a meeting that was part of National Engineers Week and these young people from around the country - middle school students - came for the finals of this big Future City Competition. These kids had to build model cities, very detailed, with water catchment areas for storm water, water filtration, thinking about fire hazards. They were building Indian cities, some did a city in Norway, some did Phoenix. Instead of yelling, I heard cheering. It's so great. It's so much more powerful.
A question was posed about the extensive and decades-old oil fields in neighborhoods near the Culver City venue for the talk, and the prospect for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, expanding there and elsewhere in the state. 
I said the newly appreciated reality that oil and gas are here for decades to come required that President Obama step beyond his "all of the above" energy strategy and craft policies that ensure we keep advancing post-fossil energy technologies and efficiency efforts:
Having cheap natural gas will impede both the build-out of renewable energy options and also basic science in energy. Obama said something very valuable early in his first term. He talked about a shock and trance energy policy in this country - mainly focused on gasoline prices. But you can see that if energy prices, especially for natural gas, stay low for a long period of time, we'll be back in a trance and the imperative for other tougher pushes, whether it's a build-out of renewables, as Joe Romm would like, or much more R. and D., as I would like, it's just going to be really hard to sustain that.
There's plenty more, including a great question about making climate-friendly fuels using carbon dioxide captured from air, posed by 14-year-old Benji Fields (the son of a friend). (I wrote about one such concept a few years ago.) I know the rumors that the president has chosen Ernest Moniz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to be his next energy secretary, but I mused that perhaps Benji had a shot.

HEADLINE: Americans Want to Cut Spending. They Just Don't Know What to Cut.

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: As the sequester looms, it&#8217;s worth noting that there&#8217;s no significant federal spending category that a majority of Americans wants to cut, according to a new Pew poll. 

 BODY:
As the sequester looms, it's worth noting that there's no significant federal spending category that a majority of Americans wants to cut:
That chart comes from a Pew Research Center poll conducted Feb. 13-18. In every category except for "aid to world's needy," more than half of the respondents wanted either to keep spending levels the same or to increase them. In the "aid to world's needy" category, less than half wanted to cut spending. 
This is part of the problem with heeding any public concerns about getting the budget under control. According to Pew, 70 percent of Americans say it is essential for Washington to pass major legislation to reduce the federal budget deficit this year. But they can't identify anything worth axing, and it's not as if tax increases are so terribly popular, either.
By the way, Pew asked similar questions about what categories of government spending to cut in 2011. There has been little change since then, with the exception of attitudes toward military spending. In the most recent poll, 24 percent said the government should cut spending for the military, compared to 30 percent two years ago.
Note that the military would bear a major share of the sequestration-related spending cuts, and as a result much has been written in the last few months about the scary consequences that such cuts would cause. So it's possible public attitudes have shifted in response to greater coverage of this spending category.

HEADLINE: Parental Leave: What Does Your Employer Offer?

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: Bucks readers are asked to help provide a progress report that will highlight paid parental leave policies at their employers. 

 BODY:
 June 7 | Updated with information from Wal-Mart. 
It's an astonishing fact, but the United States is the only country with an advanced economy that does not provide some sort of paid leave for new mothers. 
This week's Your Money column takes a closer look at the dismal state of affairs concerning parental leave over all, as well as the patchwork of policies that are on the books (or not).
The Family and Medical Leave Act, which went into effect 20 years ago this month, provides some basic but invaluable protections: it requires larger employers and public agencies to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child (or to care for yourself, an opposite-sex spouse, parent or child who has fallen ill). But experts say that about 40 percent of employees are not eligible - and many of those who are simply cannot afford to take unpaid leave.
While consumer advocates and some lawmakers are drafting legislation that would create a paid federal family leave and medical leave insurance program, the current political tenor will make passage tricky. In the meantime, whether workers have access to paid leave largely depends on where and for whom they work.
So we've decided to begin a progress report that will highlight paid parental leave policies at American employers (similar to the way we keep track of companies that equalize the cost of health insurance for same-sex couples). We're starting with responses we received from some of the largest companies, which you'll find detailed below.
The chart is still a work in progress and will be updated. (Among the companies we're waiting to hear back from are Exxon Mobil, Wal-Mart, Chevron and Berkshire Hathaway.) So please tell us about your own employer's policy with the form below, or in the comment section. We would also love to hear your thoughts on the potential creation of a paid federal family and medical leave insurance program.

HEADLINE: Government Joins Suit Against Armstrong

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

 BODY:
The Justice Department on Friday joined a federal whistle-blower lawsuit claiming that Lance Armstrong, his former team manager and the company that owned his cycling team defrauded the government because cyclists on the team, sponsored by the United States Postal Service, were engaged in a systematic, covert doping scheme.
The lawsuit, initially filed in 2010 by Floyd Landis, one of Armstrong's former teammates, asserts that the defendants concealed the doping from their sponsors because the sponsorship contract expressly prohibited the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The contract, from 2001 to 2004, was worth about $31 million. 
Ronald C. Machen Jr., United States attorney for the District of Columbia, said the government joined Landis as a plaintiff because Armstrong and his associates ''took more than $30 million from the U.S. Postal Service based on their contractual promise to play fair and abide by the rules.'' It is also unfair, he said, that the Postal Service is now associated with the cycling team that ran what the United States Anti-Doping Agency has called the most sophisticated doping program in history.
''In today's economic climate, the U.S. Postal Service is simply not in a position to allow Lance Armstrong or any of the other defendants to walk away with the tens of millions of dollars they illegitimately procured,'' Machen said in a statement.
Armstrong, who is serving a lifetime ban from Olympic sports for being the leader of a doping program on his seven Tour de France-winning teams, vehemently denied for years that he had doped. Last month, however, he admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during his Tour victories.
Since then, he has been confronted with civil lawsuits that are threatening to drain him of millions of dollars. In one recent suit, an insurance company in Dallas is trying to recoup the $12.1 million it paid him for several of his Tour victories.
But the whistle-blower case has the potential to cause the most damage to Armstrong's bank accounts. His estimated worth is about $125 million, but in federal whistle-blower lawsuits, a court or jury can award triple damages, which in this case could add up to an award of more than $90 million.
Each defendant would be liable for that amount, whistle-blower lawsuit experts say, though the government could not recoup more than the $90 million. A judge or jury would decide how much each defendant would pay.
Landis, who was stripped of his 2006 Tour title for doping, also stands to benefit if the government wins the case. As the whistle-blower, he could be given a percentage of the award.
With the government on his side, Landis's chances of winning the case have risen steeply. The Justice Department joins only about 20 percent of cases filed under the False Claims Act, said Gordon Schnell, a lawyer at the firm Constantine Cannon and a specialist in whistle-blower lawsuits. Of the cases it joins, it wins or settles 80 percent of them, he said.
''It only picks the low-hanging fruit, the cases it thinks it will settle,'' Schnell said. ''But this may just be a game of cat and mouse at this point. They could have brought the case to try to increase their leverage in working out a deal.''
Armstrong and his lawyers have been negotiating with the government to settle the case, with Armstrong offering a payment of $5 million, according to one person briefed on the talks. That person did not want to be identified because the case is ongoing. The government wanted more than double that offer, the person said.
Armstrong also wanted immunity from criminal prosecution, the person said, but the government was not able to offer him a deal, though the United States Anti-Doping Agency -- the entity that last fall published a 202-page report about Armstrong's doping -- tried to persuade the government to do so.
''Those talks failed because we disagree about whether the Postal Service was damaged,'' Robert Luskin, a lawyer for Armstrong, said in a statement. ''The Postal Service's own studies show that the service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship -- benefits totaling more than $100 million.''
Past studies by two marketing firms commissioned by the Postal Service showed that it gained about $103 million in domestic value by sponsoring the cycling team from 2001 to 2004, three times the fee the Postal Service paid to sponsor the team during that time.
The lawsuit as filed by Landis was unsealed on Friday and named several other defendants, but the Justice Department has joined against only three: Armstrong; Johan Bruyneel, his former team manager; and the now-defunct sports management company Tailwind Sports.
In the lawsuit, Landis claimed that he saw Armstrong dope and on one occasion received a blood transfusion alongside Armstrong during the 2002 Tour. Bruyneel sat by and watched those transfusions being done, Landis said. He also said that Armstrong also gave him testosterone patches and the endurance-boosting drug EPO in front of Armstrong's wife and children.
He also claimed that Bruyneel, who is facing a lifetime ban from Olympic sports, facilitated doping on the team, teaching him and other riders how to use banned drugs like human growth hormone.
Landis, through his lawyer, Paul D. Scott, said he was encouraged by the government's joining the case as a plaintiff.
To win the case, the government must prove that it was damaged by the violation of the contract, said Eric R. Havian, a lawyer at Phillips & Cohen and an expert in False Claims Act cases.
''They have to say, look, the Postal Service didn't get what we bargained for, you gave us a black eye because of the doping, and that's a legitimate case,'' Havian said. ''They might not get the full amount because they received some benefit from the sponsorship. They also have some very serious problems with Landis. He's not the most sympathetic whistle-blower in the world.''
For years, Landis lied about his own doping before confessing in 2010. He now lives in Norwalk, Conn., in a guesthouse on the multimillion-dollar waterfront property of David Williams, known as Tiger, a hedge-fund trader who invested in Tailwind Sports in 2002 but had a falling-out with Armstrong years later.
''The next step is that Armstrong and the other defendants will try to dismiss the case, and this case could last years,'' Havian said. ''I don't know if Landis is popping the Champagne cork, but it's premature to celebrate.''

HEADLINE: Dire Consequences and Denial

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
It's crunch time.
The sequester's automatic, across-the-board spending cuts are set to go into effect on Friday, and there is no plan as yet to stop it.
America, this is your feeble government at its most ineffective and self-destructive.
The White House favors a balanced plan that would include spending cuts and some tax increases for the wealthy. Republicans reject any solution that includes tax increases. 
These are two fundamentally different perspectives, only one of which is supported by a majority of Americans.
A Pew Research Center/USA Today survey released Thursday found that only 19 percent of Americans believe that the focus of deficit reduction should be only on spending cuts. Seventy-six percent want a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, with more emphasis on the former than the latter.
But the impasse could have dire consequences. A study last year by Stephen S. Fuller, a professor at George Mason University, estimates that the sequester could cost 2.14 million jobs and add 1.5 percentage points to the unemployment rate. Fuller's analysis was cited in a Congressional Research Service report prepared for members of Congress.
What's more, the sequester would reduce military spending by $42.7 billion; nonmilitary discretionary spending would drop $28.7 billion, in addition to a mandatory $9.9 billion reduction in Medicare, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
In anticipation of the very real possibility that the sequester could come to pass, some Republicans are leaning on the shoulder of an old friend: denial.
This week on CNN, Senator Rand Paul pronounced the $85 billion in mandated cuts a ''pittance'' and a ''yawn'' that is ''just really nibbling at the edges.'' He also called President Obama's warnings about the sequester's impact ''histrionics,'' ''ridiculousness'' and ''emotionalism.''
What a perfect segue to Rush Limbaugh, who took to the air this week to denounce predictions about the sequester's effects as a ''manufactured'' crisis, saying that ''for the first time in my life, I am ashamed of my country.''
Limbaugh continued:
''In truth, we're gonna spend more this year than we spent last year. We're just not gonna spend as much as was projected. It's all baseline budgeting. There is no real cut below a baseline of zero. There just isn't. Yet here they come, sucking us in, roping us in. Panic here, fear there: Crisis, destruction, no meat inspection, no cops, no teachers, no firefighters, no air traffic control. I'm sorry, my days of getting roped into all this are over.''
Those not denying the crisis are hoping to exploit it.
Karl Rove, writing in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, called the president ''a once-in-a-generation demagogue with a compliant press corps'' who will subject the American people in the short term to a ''slew of presidential photo-ops with those whom he claims will lose jobs.'' Mr. Rove advised House Republicans to ''pass a continuing resolution next week to fund the government for the balance of the fiscal year at the lower level dictated by the sequester -- with language granting the executive branch the flexibility to move funds from less vital activities to more important ones.''
Rove supports the steep cuts but wants to allow the president ''flexibility'' in applying them. That Rove is as slick as an eel. In other words, he wants to force the president to rob Peter to pay Paul and take the flak for making all the tough choices.
Another Pew Research Poll released this week found that although many Americans favor cutting government spending in the abstract, most don't agree with cuts to specific programs. ''For 18 of 19 programs tested, majorities want either to increase spending or maintain it at current levels,'' Pew found. ''The only exception is assistance for needy people around the world.''
Ah, foreign aid, the tired old whipping horse that would do virtually nothing to reduce the deficit, as it accounts for a paltry 1 percent of the federal budget.
Rove's plan to shift to the president the burden of choosing where to bring down the ax is Rove's way of getting Republicans ''to win public opinion to their side.'' That is a roundabout way of acknowledging that right now they're losing. A Bloomberg poll released this week found the president's job-approval rating at its highest level and the Republican Party's favorable rating at its lowest since September 2009.
Furthermore, the Pew/USA Today survey found that if a deal isn't reached in time, about half the public will blame Congressional Republicans while fewer than a third will blame the president.
And if the sequester happens, we'll all lose. It will be a disaster for the job market and the economy. But no one can accuse these politicians and pundits of caring about such things as long as their own jobs are secure.

HEADLINE: Working to Pay for College

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
My article in the Sunday Business section two weekends ago, about the challenge of working your way through college these days without taking on any student loan debt or receiving any help from your parents, served as a Rorschach test of sorts for readers.
Some people were thrilled that I chose to focus on hard-working individuals who have managed to get themselves a degree (or close to it) without much debt and without much help. Others thought that by glorifying a handful of extraordinary individuals, I made their accomplishments appear all too easy to reproduce when, in fact, their stories represented the fringe of undergraduate financial reality. 
Since this was an article in the news pages, and not a Your Money column, I should probably not say who I think is right. If you missed the article, please go back and read it and let us know what you think in the comments.
All that said, there were three other points of view threaded throughout the hundreds of comments that I wanted to highlight.
First, MJ from Iowa reinforced a point that Esther Manogin, Appalachian State's director of financial aid, also made in the article. Here's what MJ said:
Oh, come on. As of late last fall, average student loan debt was about $26,500. That's for an education that will last you a lifetime, and we're complaining and fretting as if it represented the end of the world. Yet, when we spend the same, or more, on a car that will be last but a few years, nobody seems concerned. Let's have some perspective, people. This really is no big deal.
This is a good point, within reason, given the large economic return on obtaining a college degree. One prudent approach for undergraduates may be this: Borrow up to the federal loan limits but no more (which means no private loans from for-profit institutions). That way, you'll be eligible for the federal income-based repayment program after graduation, which will keep your debt payments reasonable and forgive the remaining debt after a certain period of time if you can't catch up with the remaining balance.
Readers differed on whether working a lot was, in fact, a strategy for success. Commenter ''I'' from Chicago, was skeptical:
Working your way through school is not realistic. You should be studying, joining interest groups and doing internships. People who ''believe'' one should work their way through school are holding onto some piece of ideology that stopped being applicable 15 years ago, when the cost of attending school outstripped one's earning capabilities.
Perhaps. But even those who fail to graduate debt-free after many hours of work may still have a different kind of reward waiting for them from employers like andrewk829 in California:
When in my corporate experience, I have had a role in hiring recent college graduates, I have looked very favorably on those who worked in college, especially those who worked in jobs where their feet were tired or their clothes were sweat-soaked at the end of the day. I was usually less interested in the kid who had ''internships'' starting freshman year, many scored by way of well-connected parents.
The ideal profile was the student who worked part time during the school year and full time during summers. Whether it is a job as a waiter or waitress, working at a water or theme park, at a moving company, at a retail store ... it's all good. I have found that such individuals have a greater appreciation for the comparative comforts of life in the ''professional'' world (and hence are less likely to complain) and are more likely to use time efficiently and can better juggle multiple projects simultaneously.
Finally, I wondered about the built-in assumptions of relatively affluent readers like Hozeking in Naperville, Ill.
And what about parents like me paying for full tuition & living expenses for my graduating sons to the tune of $300,000? Nobody or no government helped me and my wife. It came out of our pocket. The press NEVER writes about willing supportive parents that will have to work longer than they would like (I am 57). No whining, it's just the facts of living a responsible and accountable life.
Somewhere along the way, we came to an understanding as a nation (without ever really discussing it) that if you can possibly afford to pay for your children's college education, then you should. It became a ''fact'' for ''responsible'' people, so much so that many people who save or earn a bit less than Hozeking and his wife end up borrowing for their children's education to be ''accountable.''
At some point, even affluent parents will start to cry uncle, right? Perhaps it's already happening, and you'll tell me about it below.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In 2012's Last Quarter, Growth Contracted In the Developed World

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
FOR the first time since 2009, the economies of major developed countries are shrinking.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 countries, said this week that the combined gross domestic product of its members declined at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the final three months of 2012. It was a sign of just how far the global economy has weakened since 2010, when it appeared that the recovery was gathering strength.
The estimate was preliminary, since not all countries have released figures for the quarter and those that have will be revising them. The United States, which reported a small decline of 0.1 percent in the quarter, is expected to revise that to show a small gain when it reports new figures next Thursday. 
It is unusual for downturns to be so widespread that they produce declines in the combined economies of the O.E.C.D. countries, which include all the major developed nations. Since 1962, when the O.E.C.D. statistics were first released, there have been only 13 quarters when that happened. The first three were in 1974 and 1975, during the worldwide recession brought on by the shock of soaring oil prices. There were four more in the early 1980s, during the double-dip American recession, one in 2001 and four in 2008 and 2009, during the credit crisis.
On Friday, the European Commission issued a glum forecast, saying the 27 countries in the European Union would see economic growth this year of just 0.1 percent, while the euro zone economies would shrink by 0.3 percent. If the O.E.C.D. estimates are correct, each of those forecasts would represent an improvement from 2012. During the four quarters of 2012, the O.E.C.D. estimated, the economies of the entire European Union declined by 0.6 percent, while the euro zone economies were down 0.9 percent.
The accompanying charts show the contribution from each of three sectors to the economies of the O.E.C.D. and four major parts of it -- the United States, the euro zone, Britain and Japan -- since 2006. Those sectors are private consumption, government consumption and gross investment. The charts show movements in each area over 12-month periods ending in the quarter shown.
The recent weakness is unusual in that there has been no countercyclical support from governments in many of the countries when the economy weakened. The euro zone never had a 12-month period when all three sectors shown were negative -- until the periods ending in the first three quarters of 2012. (Fourth-quarter numbers are not yet available for the sectors.)
The United States economy has been doing better than many others over the last year, and the charts show why. A major reason is that fixed capital investment is still rising at a decent clip in this country -- measured by comparing the fourth quarter of 2012 to the same quarter of the previous year -- while it is down in Japan, Britain and the euro zone.
That gain is caused entirely by the private sector, which may have benefited from a banking system that did a better job of recapitalizing in 2010 than banks in Europe did, and thus is able to finance more projects.
Government investment in the United States has been declining for more than two years.
Historically, it has been very unusual for government consumption to decline, but that has become common in many countries, including the United States. During the first decade of this century, there was not a single quarter where such consumption was lower in the United States or the euro zone than it had been a year earlier. But since then, that has become the norm, not the exception, in both regions. In the United States, federal, state and local government budgets have been squeezed, while in Europe, austerity has become the byword in many countries.
Interestingly, while the British government has proclaimed a policy of austerity, government consumption over the last year has grown faster than private consumption while capital investment has fallen.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Growth Vanishes in Developed Economies: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is composed of 34 developed economies, reported this week that the combined economies of those countries shrank in the fourth quarter of 2012, the first time that has happened since the credit crisis and only the 13th quarter with such a downturn since 1961, when the organization began collecting data.

HEADLINE: White House Uses Air Delays As Budget Prod

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Jackie Calmes, Matthew L. Wald and Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House on Friday warned of potentially severe disruptions in air travel if across-the-board spending cuts take effect in less than a week as President Obama intensified pressure on Congressional Republicans to entertain spending reductions and tax increases to avoid furloughing federal workers and limiting services.
The focus on what Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said was the high likelihood of cascading flight delays and closed towers at smaller airports showed that the Obama administration believed that the threat of widespread travel problems could sway the public and encourage voters to force Republicans to the bargaining table. 
At the same time, though, Mr. Obama privately told Democratic governors that his public campaign against Republicans was not producing results, as the two sides remained far apart.
In a session at the White House complex, the president and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried to enlist the Democratic governors to reach out to their Republican counterparts at a National Governors Association meeting this weekend to push Congressional leaders to the table. The Democratic governors said Mr. Obama expressed extreme frustration and short-term pessimism that Republicans would accept any plan with new federal revenue.
''What he was saying is, 'There's nothing that I can do to get these folks to come to the table with a balanced approach,' '' said Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. ''If we're willing to give millionaires and billionaires more breaks, and take from Americans who are struggling in the middle class, they're willing to talk. I don't think any of us are optimistic.''
Mr. LaHood, a former Republican congressman who was drafted as a spokesman partly because of his experience in dealing with Republicans on Capitol Hill, announced at the White House that $600 million in cuts to the Federal Aviation Administration would shut down more than 100 air traffic control towers at small airports in places like Joplin, Mo., and Boca Raton, Fla. He predicted travel delays at major airports in peak periods of up to 90 minutes because of the reduction in flight controllers, and said that as airlines adjusted to federal furloughs, flights were likely to be canceled and schedules changed.
''These are harmful cuts with real-world consequences that will cost jobs and hurt our economy,'' Mr. LaHood said.
The president's pessimism appeared to be an acknowledgment that the White House had made significant miscalculations in the spending fight. After the election, the administration anticipated that the president's victory and his better standing with the public would push Republicans into some compromise. In addition, in striking the 2011 deal to raise the nation's statutory borrowing limit, Democrats believed that Republican reluctance to allow deep cuts to the Pentagon would lead them to back off the automatic cuts, known as the sequester.
But on Friday, Republicans remained adamant that they would accept no tax increases to head off the cuts. Republicans say they are willing to instead get some savings from programs not covered by Congress's annual spending bills, like food stamps, Medicaid and children's health insurance. The House twice passed bills to do that last year. But Republicans say they already swallowed $600 billion in tax increases in the New Year's Eve deal that ended the last budget impasse.
''The president got $600 billion in higher taxes just last month, with no spending cuts,'' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner. ''His appetite for tax hikes evidently knows no end. If the president really believes in 'balance,' it's time to finally deal with our spending problem.''
Barring a last-minute deal that is more unlikely by the day, $85 billion in spending cuts will go into force next Friday, slicing many domestic programs by 9 percent and carving 13 percent from unprotected military programs over the rest of the fiscal year.
Some at the governors' meeting with the president said he believed that there was still an opportunity for a deal in the months ahead, but not in the next week.
''I think he's long-term optimistic,'' said Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland. ''Short-term, he believes Republicans seem hellbent on slowing job recovery through sequestration, which in some perverse way they see as a win.''
Publicly, the president maintained a faint hope that a deal could still be reached before Friday.
''Hope springs eternal,'' he told reporters during a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. ''And I will just keep on making my case not only to Congress, but more importantly the American people to take a smart approach to deficit reduction and do it in a way that doesn't endanger our economy and endanger jobs.''
Governors in Washington from both parties were careful not to follow some members of Congress in embracing the pending cuts. Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, who served two terms as a Republican member of the House, urged the president and Congressional leaders to come together. She said that there was equal blame to go around.
''This is really, really serious for our nation,'' Ms. Fallin said in an interview with reporters. ''It's serious for our economy. It's affecting people's lives. It's time for Congress and the administration to sit down and work together to find a common path, but I'm worried that they may not.''
So far, Congress's return to Washington next week holds little prospect for a resolution. The Senate will vote next week -- probably on Wednesday -- on competing Democratic and Republican sequester plans, and neither is expected to get the 60 votes necessary to pass under the rules that will be adopted.
The Senate Democratic legislation would cancel the cuts for the 2013 fiscal year with a $110 billion plan that would establish a 30 percent minimum tax rate for income over $1 million, tax tar sands oil, cut farm subsidies and slice $27.5 billion from military spending after most troops have been withdrawn from Afghanistan.
Senate Republicans have not yet decided which alternative they will offer. One would pay off this year's cuts by imposing a 10-year hiring freeze on federal workers. Republicans may also offer legislation to give federal agencies more flexibility to impose the cuts and choose which programs to hit and which to spare. White House officials say they oppose that bill, fearing it would give lawmakers a false sense that they had taken the sting out of the cuts. But opposing such a measure would be difficult for Democrats.

HEADLINE: Fed Officials Debate Bank's Losses Once Economy Mends

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's plans for the eventual wind-down of its economic stimulus campaign could provoke a political reaction that will make it more difficult to control inflation, a current Fed official and a former Fed governor said Friday.
When the economy grows stronger, the Fed plans to sell some of its vast holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed also plans to pay banks to leave some money on deposit with it to limit the pace of new lending. 
And that could prove an awkward combination. The Fed faces the possibility of large losses as it sells off securities, which could force the central bank to suspend annual payments to the Treasury Department for the first time since the 1930s, even as it would be increasing the amounts paid to the banking industry for its cash holdings at the Fed to control inflation.
''That sounds like a recipe for political problems,'' said James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. He described the predicament as one reason the Fed might consider limiting its plans for additional asset purchases.
But Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said that concerns about potential losses needed to be weighed against the benefits of asset purchases. The Fed holds almost $3 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage bonds, and it is adding about $85 billion a month in an effort to cut unemployment.
Mr. Rosengren, a leading advocate of the purchases, said Boston Fed research showed asset purchases this year could help create about 400,000 new jobs.
''That's what the Federal Reserve should really be caring about, what's happening with the dual mandate with and without'' the asset purchases, Mr. Rosengren said. ''When I think about the costs, I have to weigh that against the benefits,'' he said at the US Monetary Policy Forum in New York on Friday.
By law, the Fed sends most of its profits to the Treasury, and in recent years those profits have soared as the Fed has collected interest on its investments. Last year, the central bank contributed $89 billion to the public coffers -- essentially refunding a significant portion of the federal government's annual borrowing costs.
The purpose of the investment portfolio is to hold down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. As the economy revives, the Fed has said it will begin selling some of those holdings. But it faces potential losses on those sales because interest rates would be rising. Security prices, which move inversely to rates, would be falling, and the government would be issuing new debt at the higher rates, making the low-yield bonds that the Fed holds less valuable.
Estimating the potential losses requires a wide range of assumptions on Fed policy, economic growth and interest rates. A Fed analysis published last month, which assumed that interest rates rose to 3.8 percent later this decade, estimated that the central bank might record losses of $40 billion and suspend contributions to the Treasury for four years beginning in 2017. If rates rose by another percentage point, however, the analysis estimated that losses would triple. An independent analysis published on Friday foresaw losses of around $20 billion and a suspension of payments for only three years.
The Fed can afford to lose money because it can simply print more. It would record a liability, and pay down the debt as profits rebounded.
But there are signs that the Fed's political opponents would seize on any losses as evidence of economic malpractice. And such that criticism could come at a vulnerable moment: central banks are never popular when they are raising interest rates.
Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, cited the potential losses in an open letter this week to the Fed chief, Ben S. Bernanke, requesting more information on what he called ''the potentially devastating consequences from any unwind.''
Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor, insisted Friday that the central bank would not allow its course to be influenced by such political pressure.
''We're independent for a reason,'' he said. ''Congress has given us a job to do.''
Some supporters of current Fed policy also argue that an economic revival would inoculate the central bank against criticism, in part because the government's coffers would be filling even without the Fed's contributions.
But Frederic S. Mishkin, a Columbia economist and one of the authors of the independent analysis of the Fed's potential losses, said that was wishful thinking.
''Politicians have very short memories,'' said Professor Mishkin, a former Fed governor. ''They're going to focus very much on the fact that the Fed is no longer pulling its weight in terms of producing remittances for the federal government.''

HEADLINE: Dismal Data and Gloomy Forecasts From Europe

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris and Catherine Rampell from New York.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Despite growing confidence that Europe is managing its debt crisis and is poised to embark on a recovery, fresh developments on Friday indicated that the region continues to struggle to stimulate growth while cutting spending to pare deficits.
A top European official warned on Friday that the euro area economy would shrink for the second consecutive year and that countries like France and Spain would miss fiscal targets meant to ensure the stability of the common currency. Separately, the European Central Bank announced that the region's banks planned to repay less than half the expected amount of low-interest loans they took out a year ago. And Moody's Investors Service downgraded Britain's government bonds from its top AAA rating.
The economic doldrums could set the stage for ripple effects for the United States, particularly in the financial markets.
''The straight growth channel in Europe is weighing on the U.S. right now, but the more important channel through which the euro area hits the U.S. is in financial markets, and problems that could affect consumer and business sentiment,'' said Joseph Lupton, senior global economist at JPMorgan Chase. ''Where it becomes a big deal is if there's some other stress point, if something else flares up in the financial markets.'' 
Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, forecast growth across the 27-nation European Union of just 0.1 percent this year and a contraction of 0.3 percent among the 17 countries in the euro zone.
Mr. Rehn's presentation signaled ''another year of falling output and rising unemployment in store in 2013,'' said Tom Rogers, a senior economic adviser at Ernst & Young.
Prospects for growth in many parts of the European Union were ''very disappointing,'' Mr. Rehn acknowledged at a news conference, where he presented a so-called winter economic forecast prepared by his department at the European Commission, the bloc's administrative arm.
''The ongoing rebalancing of the European economy is continuing to weigh on growth in the short term,'' Mr. Rehn said.
Just three months ago, the commission forecast that the euro area economy would grow by 0.1 percent this year, and other officials had talked about a turnaround starting this year.
Mr. Rehn said the European economy should resume expanding in 2014, with growth reaching 1.6 percent across the European Union and 1.4 percent in the euro zone.
In another sign of continued weakness in the financial system, European banks plan to repay less than half the expected amount of low-interest loans they took from the European Central Bank.
The central bank lent more than 1 trillion euros ($1.33 trillion) in two operations in December 2011 and February 2012. The cheap loans provided a life raft for the region's banking sector, which ran into difficulty during the debt crisis. During the period of uncertainty, banks refused to lend to one another. Late last month, banks paid back 137 billion euros of the loans, more than expected, suggesting that at least some banks were able to raise money on their own.
But on Friday, the central bank said that banks that took the second round of loans planned to return 61 billion euros in the latest repayment, much less than many had expected.
Moody's downgraded its rating on Britain's debt to Aa1 from AAA, citing continuing weakness in the country's medium-term growth outlook and rising debt burden. The rising debt means ''a deterioration in the shock-absorption capacity of the government's balance sheet, which is unlikely to reverse before 2016,'' the agency said.
Britain has been cutting spending to pare its deficit but has failed so far to stimulate growth. Its economy expanded 0.9 percent in the third quarter but contracted 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter.
Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings still have AAA ratings on Britain's debt, though their outlooks are negative.
The move comes after other prominent downgrades. Moody's lowered France from its top rating in November. Before that, Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States from AAA in August 2011 and lowered France and Austria in January 2012.
In the euro zone, the European Commission also forecast that unemployment would continue to rise this year, to 12.2 percent, up from 11.4 percent in 2012.
In Spain, the commission said it expected joblessness to hit 26.9 percent, up from 25 percent last year. In Greece, the forecast was for unemployment to leap to 27 percent from 24.7 percent a year earlier.
Even in buoyant Germany, which is expected to grow this year by 0.5 percent, unemployment was seen nudging up slightly this year, to 5.7 percent, from 5.5 percent in 2012.
The grim figures add fuel to a furious debate over whether an insistence on austerity is creating a self-perpetuating cycle where state spending cuts diminish demand, weakening tax revenue and further straining government finances.
Blaming the effects of belt-tightening for Europe's continued economic woes, particularly in the case of Spain, is too simplistic, said Guntram B. Wolff, the deputy director of Bruegel, a research organization.
''Perhaps the real reason for the deterioration in the economic situation in Europe was the massive drop in confidence of international investors in the ability of the euro area to overcome its more systemic problems,'' Mr. Wolff wrote in a blog posting shortly after Mr. Rehn's news conference.
The commission said Spain's deficit was expected to fall to 6.7 percent of gross domestic product this year, down from 10.2 percent in 2012, partly because of tax increases and a sharp reduction in year-end bonuses for public sector workers. But that still fell wide of the official target of 4.5 percent, and the commission warned that Spain's deficit could rise to 7.2 percent in 2014.
In the case of France, the commission attributed economic stagnation to declining household spending linked to rising unemployment -- which the report said was expected to reach 10.7 percent this year, then climb to 11 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 10.3 percent in 2012. In addition, the report cited a drop in confidence among French entrepreneurs.
The report forecast that the French budget deficit for 2013 would be 3.7 percent of G.D.P., down from an estimated 4.6 percent in 2012, but well above the government's official target of 3 percent. The commission also warned that the deficit could rise to 3.9 percent in 2014.
In a sign of flexibility, Mr. Rehn said deadlines for meeting budgetary targets could be extended in the cases of France and Spain, assuming their governments could demonstrate progress in adopting fiscal reforms despite the unexpectedly tough economic environment.
As long as countries ''have a credible medium-term strategy for fiscal consolidation,'' then ''it can make sense to take into account weaker growth to have more time for the fiscal adjustment,'' said Mr. Rehn, who will probably make those decisions in May.

1913 Fair Play in Dressmaking
PARIS -- Mr. J. M. Giddings, the New York dressmaker, whose opinion of the measures taken by Paris dressmakers to suppress fraudulent imitations of their creations has been published in the Herald, left Liverpool yesterday [Feb. 22] on the Mauretania on his way back to America. Seen by a Herald correspondent before he left Paris on Friday, Mr. Giddings seemed a little concerned at the way his opinion had been interpreted. Questioned regarding the general trend of fashion this season, Mr. Giddings said that crêpe, shantung, tussor, all in bright colors such as Pompeian red, paprika, geranium, absinthe or chartreuse and also Chinese reds and blues, will predominate this spring. 
1938 Dying Patient Revived 4 Times
PARIS -- A man who died four times while his heart was being stitched, and four times came to life again, is now on the way to complete recovery in the Saint-Antoine Hospital in Paris. The man's name has not been divulged, nor have those of the three young surgeons who saved him from death by suspending his life and then resuscitating him. The patient, a man who had been unemployed for five years, was brought into the hospital at 8:30 p.m. February 12. He was suffering from a self-inflicted heart wound, having plunged a kitchen knife into his thorax in the presence of his wife. Under the X-rays, the heart appeared about five times its normal size and almost still. An urgent operation was decided upon by the three young surgeons on night service, and it was begun at 9:15 o'clock.
1963 U.S. Aims to End 'Castroism'
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara told the Senate Armed Services Committee today [Feb. 22] that the United States is pursuing a policy designed to ''eliminate Castroism and Communism from Cuba.'' This was revealed by Sen. Richard R. Russell, D., Ga., after Mr. McNamara ended four days of secret testimony before the committee. Mr. McNamara also said that United States planes would shoot any Cuban plane that attacked American ships or installations. His remarks were made public as Washington seethed over the attack by Cuba-based, Soviet-made MiG fighters on Wednesday on an American shrimp boat in international waters between Cuba and Florida.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Halts Slide, but Ends Week Mixed

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Friday, as strong earnings from big companies lifted the Dow Jones industrial average, but the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted its first weekly loss of the year.
The Dow closed up 119.95 points, or 0.9 percent, at 14,000.57, its third-biggest daily gain this year. The S.& P. 500 rose 13.18 points, also 0.9 percent, to 1,515.60. The Nasdaq composite index rose 30.33, or 1 percent, to 3,161.82.
The S.& P. 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower for the week, while the Dow edged higher. 
Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Wealth Management, said he expected stocks to hold up despite the volatility this week.
''You're going to get bumps and bruises along the way, but we do believe things are actually getting better, so I think there's underlying demand'' for stocks, Mr. Stone said.
Investors sent stocks plunging Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting revealed disagreement over how long the Fed should continue to buy bonds in an effort to support the economy. The slide continued Thursday. The Dow lost 155 points over those two days.
Many analysts say the Fed's bond-buying and resulting low interest rates have driven this year's stock rally, which lifted indexes to their highest levels since before the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow is now just 164 points below its nominal record close of 14,164, reached in October 2007.
United States stocks followed European stocks higher after a survey of German business optimism showed an increase in sentiment, adding to evidence that the country would avoid a recession. Germany's economic vitality is crucial for the beleaguered region, offsetting economic contraction in surrounding countries.
''Germany is really the bedrock,'' Mr. Stone said. ''If it gives way, then you have real problems.''
The CAC-40 in France rose 2.2 percent, and the Germany DAX gained 1 percent.
The biggest gainer on Friday in both the Dow and S.& P. 500 was Hewlett-Packard, which beat all forecasts when it posted its first-quarter results late Thursday, a relief after months of bad news. H.P.'s shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose $2.10, or 12.3 percent, to $19.20.
Cabot Oil & Gas was the S.& P. 500's second-best performer, a day after the company reported earnings above analysts' expectations. Its stock rose $5.95, or 11.1 percent, to $59.81.
Shares in the American International Group jumped after the company's fourth-quarter operating results exceeded analysts' forecasts. Its net loss was $4 billion, mainly because of claims related to Hurricane Sandy. A.I.G. shares rose $1.17, or 3.1 percent, to $38.45. Abercrombie & Fitch shares sank after a crucial sales measure declined in the all-important holiday quarter. The stock fell $2.19, or 4.5 percent, to $46.86.
Stock in WebMD Health, a health Web site operator, soared after the company reported better-than-expected revenue and an optimistic outlook for 2013. The shares rose $4.14, or 25.4 percent, to $20.44.
Texas Instruments stock rose strongly after the company said it would increase its dividend by a third and buy back up to $5 billion more of its own stock. Its shares gained $1.70, or 5.2 percent, to $34.18.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 100 11/32, and the yield fell to 1.96 percent, from 1.97 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Deep Differences Cloud Obama's Budget Hopes

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even as President Obama lashes out at Republicans over the automatic spending cuts that take effect next week, he is simultaneously sending them a strikingly different message: he is still interested in a big deficit-reduction deal and as evidence of his good faith has left on the table proposed Medicare and Social Security cuts that liberals hate.
With neither side making much effort to avert the across-the-board reductions in military and domestic programs that kick in next Friday, signals from the White House about a much more ambitious budget package might seem to be somewhere between delusional and beside the point -- not to mention politically self-serving. On Capitol Hill, Republicans say Mr. Obama has actually backtracked from where he was 18 months ago on reining in the entitlement programs and has shown no willingness to do anything really hard to get the nation's long-term debt problems under control.
But administration officials say that some kind of opportunity is likely to present itself this year to engage Congressional Republicans on a comprehensive plan. In addition to rebutting Republican claims that he has no plan of his own, Mr. Obama wants to make clear to Republicans, aides said, that even after the failure of successive negotiations he remains willing to make difficult concessions. 
That is especially true, they said, when it comes to entitlement programs, the focus of the sharpest ideological clashes between the two parties and the biggest contributors to the long-term budget imbalances.
His aides point to Mr. Obama's continued willingness to swallow, over the intensifying objections of most of the left side of his party, a new way of calculating inflation adjustments for Social Security benefits that would reduce the growth of payments -- in effect, a benefit cut. And Mr. Obama has alluded repeatedly to his willingness to re-engage with Republicans based on his last offer for $400 billion in Medicare cuts, made during the negotiations in December over the so-called fiscal cliff; that's a level that gives heartburn to some Democrats in Congress who see no need to compromise at this point.
''That offer is out there for them to accept anytime they want to take it, and it carries some considerable cost to us,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama's senior adviser. ''I'm not sure what more we could do to show we're serious.''
The continued maneuvering reflects a calculation inside the White House that there is still a path to a legacy-enhancing budget deal, notwithstanding Speaker John A. Boehner's pledge not to allow any tax increases or engage in closed-door negotiations with the president.
The starting point, administration officials say, is to allow the normal budget process to play out in Congress in coming months, while encouraging both parties to explore ideas for overhauling the tax code. At some point the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House could begin to consider areas for compromise, providing a natural forum for a negotiation in which Mr. Obama would not necessarily need to be the central player.
To the degree that an improving economy and signs of a reduced rate of growth in health care costs push projected budget deficits lower, the climate for a deal could also brighten.
But that optimistic view of the possibilities ignores the deep differences between the parties, not only on taxes, the most obvious sticking point, but also on entitlement programs, where Democrats and Republicans have such profoundly different viewpoints about what needs to be done that a deal would require one or the other of them to budge in a fundamental way.
While Mr. Obama clearly sees his offer on entitlements as a way to build trust with Republicans, many conservatives see it as evidence that they will never reach an accord because they define the problem in such different ways.
Mr. Obama sees the challenge of Medicare largely as a matter of reducing federal outlays for the existing system by limiting payments to providers and better employing the government's purchasing power; many Republicans see the current system as unsustainable given the growing costs of an aging population and are seeking to rebuild Medicare in a way that injects far more market competition into health care. The mechanism preferred by conservatives in recent years has been the so-called ''premium support'' model, in which Medicare beneficiaries would receive a check from the government to purchase their own policies or regular Medicare coverage -- the approach championed by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the party's vice-presidential nominee last year.
In other words, where Mr. Obama sees dealing with Medicare as mostly a matter of math, Republicans see it as a matter of ideology.
''Republicans and Democrats are not just talking about differences of degree,'' said Yuval Levin, an informal adviser to Mr. Ryan and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative research group. ''They are talking about differences of direction.''
Inside the White House, there is deep skepticism about whether Republicans actually want to address Medicare in an immediate and concrete way -- or whether Republicans would prefer to pillory Democrats for backing Medicare cuts, as they did successfully in the 2010 midterm elections and could again in 2014, and avoid voting for anything themselves that could bring a backlash from voters. The most recent version of Mr. Ryan's plan, for example, would make no changes to Medicare for a decade.
Whether in dealing with the automatic budget cuts or the longer-term issues, the lack of trust between the two sides remains almost complete. To talk successively to senior administration officials and top Republican aides on Capitol Hill this week about the fiscal-policy climate is to be plunged back into bitterly competing narratives about how the other side is unable to stand up to its base, unwilling to give any ground and more interested in turning the politics to its advantage than doing what is right for the country.
''The menu of entitlement reform options discussed over the last two years is the bare minimum necessary to start solving our long-term debt crisis,'' said Kevin Smith, communications director for Mr. Boehner. ''And the fact that this president is backpedaling on key reforms rather than showing the courage to take on his own party is not a promising sign.''
At the White House, they say they do not get enough credit from Republicans for bucking the Democratic Party's liberal base by supporting the cuts to Social Security's cost-of-living adjustments. They also point to their willingness to embrace substantial Medicare cuts that would put some Democratic members of Congress at risk in their next elections.
Republicans are especially dismissive of Mr. Obama's outreach on the entitlement programs. They say that in the summer of 2011 the president was willing to consider increasing the age for Medicare eligibility but has subsequently backed away from that position under pressure from liberals in what Republicans interpret as a sign of unwillingness at the White House to take on anything other than relatively easy cuts to health care providers.
''There has been no leadership from the White House and Senate majority to pursue structural reforms to those programs,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, ''despite the importance of saving Medicare and Medicaid for future generations.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Paid Family Leave, U.S. Trails Most of the Globe

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD. 
Ron Lieber will be on book leave until the end of 2013.

 BODY:
There I was, on the day my six months of maternity leave had ended, pushing my son's stroller with one hand, clutching a jumbo box of 174 diapers with the other, doing my best to navigate through piles of slushy snow.
It was time for his first day of day care, my time at home over in a blink.
Still, I knew I was relatively fortunate. The first eight weeks of my leave were paid, and I had tacked on another three weeks of paid vacation. Plus, my employer permits workers to take up to six months of unpaid leave.
A large majority of new parents in this country are not so lucky. It is no secret that when it comes to paid parental leave, the United States is among the least generous in the world, ranking down with the handful of countries that don't offer any paid leave at all, among them Liberia, Suriname and Papua New Guinea. 
The American situation hasn't materially improved since the landmark Family and Medical Leave Act was signed into law 20 years ago this month by President Clinton. The law requires larger employers and public agencies to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave -- as well as continuation of health benefits -- for the birth or adoption of a child, or to care for an opposite-sex spouse, a parent or a child who has fallen ill (or to deal with your own health problem).
But about 40 percent of workers fall through the cracks because the law only requires many companies with 50 or more employees to comply. To get the benefit, employees must also have worked for the company for at least a year and logged 1,250 hours within the last 12 months. And lots of people simply cannot afford to take unpaid leave.
''This was really intended as a first step,'' said Vicki Shabo, director of work and family programs at the National Partnership for Women and Families, referring to the law, which the group helped write. ''People really see this as an individual struggle that they need to be responsible for rather than the societywide, systemic issue it is.''
But expanding the policy's reach has been painfully slow. Some states have taken it upon themselves to bolster the rules and now cover a broader swath of workers or provide some paid leave. And companies that tend to work the hardest to lure employees, including Google, have gone much further to fill in the governmental gaps. (The Bucks personal finance blog will begin to track companies' parental leave policies. So please let us know about your employer's rules in the comments section.)
Despite the myriad benefits of paid leaves, the number of employers that offer the time off is dismal. ''We know maternity leave is associated with lower infant mortality rates,'' said Jody Heymann, dean of the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of the new book ''Children's Chances: How Countries Can Move From Surviving to Thriving.''
She added: ''This makes sense. As well as receiving more one-on-one care, infants are more likely to be breast-fed, which lowers illness and hospitalization rates for infants and benefits women's health. Beyond the marked health advantages, paid maternity leave yields economic gains in terms of reduced health care costs, reduced recruitment and retraining and improved long-term earnings for women.''
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 11 percent of all private industry workers have access to paid family leave (16 percent of state and local government employees have access to some paid family leave; federal workers don't get any, though all employees may be able to use accrued sick leave). Well-paid people who work in managerial or professional occupations at companies with 100 employees or more are the most likely to have the benefit, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research.
Even the policies at some of the most generous American companies pale in comparison with the 31 countries that provide a year or more of paid maternity leave, typically through government-run insurance programs, experts say. Working Mother compiles a list of the ''100 Best Companies'' in the United States each year, and parental leave policies are one of several factors baked into those rankings.
Even among the standouts, the average time off in 2012 was seven weeks of fully paid maternity leave, while new fathers received an average of three paid weeks, up from two weeks in 2008. Parents adopting children received an average of six weeks. Keep in mind that the list is not exhaustive. Companies must apply to get on and be willing to fill out a 550-item questionnaire. They must also have at least 500 employees and offer some form of paid maternity leave.
Google beefed up its paid leave for new mothers in 2007 to five months after company officials realized that women were leaving the company at twice the rate of men. After the change, attrition dropped by half. New fathers receive seven weeks of paid leave, as do adoptive parents and other parents who don't physically give birth, including same-sex partners.
''What one person might get is an accident of where you happen to work or where you happen to be,'' Ms. Shabo said. ''Instead, what we need are public policies that provide a basic level of protection.''
While the United States takes great pride in its family values, it is the only high-income country that does not offer a paid leave program. (Eight countries in all don't offer the benefit, according to Dr. Heymann's research.) Most of Europe and Central Asia -- or 38 of 53 countries -- provide 26 weeks or more of paid leave for mothers, according to Dr. Heymann's research. ''Twenty years ago there were a few other advanced economies that did not yet provide paid leave, and now, the U.S. is entirely isolated,'' she said.
Some lawmakers in Washington have proposed expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act so that it covers more people, either by reducing the required number of hours an employee must work to become eligible or by including smaller companies with 25 or more employees.
Other consumer advocates and members of Congress are more ambitious. They would like to see a paid federal family leave and medical leave insurance program.
Ms. Shabo's organization, together with the Center for American Progress, has been working with lawmakers to draft legislation that would provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave for the arrival of a new child or for a parent's serious illness or that of a family member. The costs would be split between workers and their employers, who would each contribute two-tenths of 1 percent of workers' wages to pay for insurance that would replace up to 66 percent of a worker's usual wages, subject to a cap of about $1,000 a week.
A handful of states have already struck out on their own and devised similar programs that might serve as models. California and New Jersey, for instance, have established family leave insurance laws -- built on those states' temporary disability insurance programs -- which allow workers to take paid leave to care for a new child (or a sick family member). The costs are borne by employees. Under the California program, created in 2002, workers pay 1 percent of their wages to cover both their state disability insurance and paid family leave insurance, which provides 55 percent of an employee's weekly salary up to about $1,000 a week. New parents can take up to six weeks of family leave; pregnant women can also take time under the program to recover from childbirth.
New Jersey's program, which began operating in 2009, typically provides two-thirds of the average of a worker's last eight weeks of pay, to a maximum of $584 a week, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.
In New York, new mothers can tap the state's temporary disability insurance program, which is paid for by contributions from both employers and employees and provides up to a paltry $170 a week. (Employers pay, but can seek up to 100 percent of the contribution from employees.) Rhode Island and Hawaii also have provisions for replacing some income.
The patchwork of state laws that are stitched with different company rules can be difficult to navigate, particularly for new parents. ''It shouldn't matter where you live or who you work for,'' Ms. Shabo argued. ''All that matters is that you should have time to take care of your children without worrying about facing major financial turmoil.''
Kenneth Matos, senior director of employment research and practice at the Families and Work Institute, a research group, emphasized the importance of being able to make decisions that work within the context of the entire family.
''When only the birth parent can take paid leave, you put people in a situation where they have to follow traditional gender roles, which doesn't always make sense,'' Dr. Matos said. ''If the male partner has a more flexible job it doesn't matter, because she is the one who gets the leave. A lot of people are beginning to talk about how these issues need to be looked at as overall family issues, and the decisions need to be made in the context of all of the people involved.''

HEADLINE: Alive and Well at Merkin Concert Hall

BYLINE: By CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM

 BODY:
The Wafels & Dinges truck was getting ready to close for business when I hurried out of the subway at Lincoln Center this week, and the heady smell of burned sugar followed me as I turned north in the direction of the Kaufman Center. I was going to a New York Festival of Song concert, the first half of which was dedicated to the music of Jacques Brel, Belgium's greatest gift -- somewhat ahead of gaufres de Liège -- to civilization. That prospect, in combination with the smell, turned knots in my stomach.
When it comes to Brel and waffles, I'm a purist. The slightest dusting of powdered sugar ruins the ratio of crispness to goo in a fresh street gaufre. The take-no-prisoners toppings that Wafels & Dinges offers New Yorkers -- dulce de leche, pulled pork, Nutella -- have me clamoring for Unesco intervention. Would Brel's songs be rendered equally unrecognizable by the evening's classically trained singers? And should Brel really share a stage, as the Festival of Song forced him to, with the French chansonnier Charles Trénet, whose songs had all the surface gloss and puffed-up insubstantiality of an éclair? 
I grew up in Brussels, the hometown of Brel (1929-78), the greatest of 20th-century singer-songwriters. He had been dead for a decade by the time I was a teenager, stumbling out of bars at closing time with my friends shouting the chorus of ''Les Bourgeois'' into the perpetual drizzle, but his songs are inextricably linked with that Sturm und Drang period of my life.
Written in a language that is both economical and daring -- the word frère, ''brother,'' becomes a verb in ''Jojo'' -- Brel's songs offer profound lessons in life's small triumphs, love's big compromises and the soul-sustaining qualities of defiance and compassion. Defiance of death and bigots; compassion for the shy, the elderly, the fighting bulls ''bored on a Sunday afternoon, when it is time to suffer for us'': All of these were sung in Brel's raw, elegant and nicotine-stained baritone and delivered with a style so intensely physical that it left him soaked in sweat at the end of a show.
As I settled into my seat in Merkin Concert Hall on Tuesday, I quickly perused the biographies of the two French singers who were to perform there, the tenor Philippe Pierce and the mezzo-soprano Marie Lenormand. Both were evidently well versed in the music of Mozart and Massenet and had benefited from years of training in how to balance chest voice and head voice. But would they know how to activate the gut-to-heart axis that Brel's songs required?
Mr. Pierce opened with ''La Valse à Mille Temps,'' a waltz that gradually picks up speed, and though I admired his crisp diction in the frenetic final stanzas, his voice struck me as a little too smooth and polished for this wild carousel ride. Ms. Lenormand took on ''Rosa,'' a tango that similarly surveys the whole span of a human life within a deceptively simple framework. She delivered an irresistible impersonation of Brel's perpetually bored student in Latin class, but the instrumentation sometimes overpowered her singing. (Steven Blier, the artistic director of the Festival of Song, accompanied the singers on the piano, assisted by Bill Schimmel on accordion and Greg Utzig, who switched between guitar, mandolin and banjo throughout the evening.)
Both singers joined forces for ''Les Bourgeois,'' the anthem of my rebellious years, and though I still found Ms. Lenormand's resonant high register a bit silly in a chorus that likens the middle class to pigs who become more stupid with age, I began to warm to the dramatic commitment of both singers, who acted out every nuance of Brel's characters with great comic flair.
In ''Sur la Place,'' Ms. Lenormand's lower range came into its own with its street-smart edge, which was finally more Brecht than Brahms. Her rendition of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas'' put to rest my reservations about Brel in an art-song context. The contrast between the raw vulnerability of her incessantly repeated do-not-leave-me pleas and the shimmering artistry of her attempts to lure the beloved back -- with promises of fairy-tale treasures and raindrops culled from countries where it never rains -- revealed new facets of this desperate and heart-wrenching masterpiece. And the gorgeous melody of ''La Chanson des Vieux Amants'' certainly suffered no injury in Mr. Pierce's tender rendition.
The second half of the program was given over to songs by Trénet, who, in Mr. Blier's engaging commentary, came alive as a poetic soul whose songs work their charm by quiet wit and an invariably uplifting trajectory. Ms. Lenormand sang his best-known work, ''La Mer,'' with beautiful breath control and gamin sweetness. Both singers delivered a riotously goofy finale with ''Grand-Maman, C'est New York.''
I was gratified to hear a hall packed with New Yorkers cheer and applaud the music of Brel 35 years after his death. If the concert leads many of them to seek out his original recordings, all the better. As for whipped cream-free waffles, I'm not getting my hopes up.

HEADLINE: Japan and United States Reaffirm Their Close Ties

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Martin Fackler contributed reporting from Tokyo.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, met at the White House on Friday to show that their countries were putting relations back on solid footing after several years of friction, and at a time when the allies face the challenge of an increasingly powerful China.
Their meeting yielded no announcements of major policy changes, and the leaders did not even address publicly whether Japan would speed the relocation of an important United States military base on Okinawa. But the summit suggested at least the potential for a warming, with the administration adding a White House luncheon including Vice President Joseph R. Biden to extend the leaders' time together. 
And a joint statement hinted at an opening that could give Mr. Abe political cover, once back in Tokyo, to push for Japan's participation in talks toward an Asia-Pacific trade agreement among democracies in the region struggling against China's growing economic clout.
Japan is central to Mr. Obama's effort to shift America's focus toward the Pacific Rim after years of preoccupation with war and with counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East and North Africa. And Mr. Abe, whose country is embroiled in an increasingly nasty territorial dispute with China, signaled his eagerness to maintain a close relationship with the United States, reversing signs sent by one of his recent predecessors who suggested Tokyo should pull back a little from Washington.
Mr. Abe is the fifth Japanese prime minister Mr. Obama has dealt with as president, a turnover reflecting the nation's years of economic and political instability that has, in turn, complicated relations between Washington and its biggest Asian ally.
''Japan is one of our closest allies, and the U.S.-Japan alliance is the central foundation for our regional security and so much of what we do in the Pacific region,'' Mr. Obama told reporters when they were allowed briefly into the Oval Office during a meeting with Mr. Abe.
Mr. Abe, sitting beside him near the fireplace, said, ''I think I can declare with confidence that the trust and the bond in our alliance is back.''
Both leaders said they had agreed on the need for what Mr. Obama called ''strong actions'' against North Korea's latest rebuff to the global community -- last week's underground nuclear test. Mr. Abe spoke of possible financial sanctions, and also said that the two allies would press the United Nations for a resolution calling for further international penalties.
With Japan also concerned about China's claims to a group of Japanese-controlled islands, Mr. Abe said: ''When we look at the security environment in the Asia Pacific, it's becoming more and more difficult. And we need to create an order in this region based on cooperation between our two countries to secure the freedom of the seas and to secure a region which is governed based on laws, not on force.''
Mr. Abe also seemed to move closer to committing Japan to join the United States and other Pacific Rim nations in negotiating the regional free-trade agreement -- and in a way that seemed intended to satisfy both leaders' separate domestic political concerns. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership has been a priority of Mr. Obama's economic and foreign policy agenda since late 2011.
While Mr. Abe's advisers have said he has personally favored joining the talks, in keeping with his emphasis on an economic stimulus program that has become known as ''Abenomics'' in Tokyo, he faces domestic political risks: Mr. Abe regained office less than two months ago, and his party faces critical parliamentary elections in July, when it will need the support of rice farmers skeptical of more open markets.
In a joint statement, the two governments agreed that if Japan does participate in the trade talks, there would be no exemptions stopping discussions on any products, a starting point the United States had insisted upon. But the statement also recognized ''that both countries have bilateral trade sensitivities, such as certain agricultural products for Japan and certain manufactured products for the United States'' and held that Japan would not have to commit to ending all tariffs upon joining the talks. Even so, the goal of the trade talks is a comprehensive agreement that eliminates tariffs.
With Japan still the world's third-largest economy despite two decades of economic weakness, its participation in the negotiations is considered all but essential to any agreement's success. But the Obama administration had opposed any exemptions or preconditions to secure Tokyo's entry, especially given the opposition of American agricultural and manufacturing interests, including automakers.
A response to the leaders' joint statement from Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan testified to the skepticism within Mr. Obama's party. ''There must be a clear, concrete understanding that before Japan would join the T.P.P. negotiations that those negotiations would result in a real change in Japan's policies and practices,'' Mr. Levin said, referring to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
On another issue of importance to Mr. Abe, the prime minister indicated that Japan had American reassurance of support in Tokyo's increasingly tense dispute with China over islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, though he did not specify what that meant. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton last month warned China against ''unilateral'' actions challenging Japan's control. But the United States is neutral on the question of the islands' sovereignty and has cautioned both countries against hostilities, which could potentially draw in the United States since it is obligated by treaty to come to Japan's defense.
Mr. Abe, who has taken hawkish stands in the past, also signaled that he had reassured the Americans that he would not act rashly and instead would seek to improve relations with Beijing.
On Friday, a Japanese government spokesman said Japan has asked Beijing to explain why Chinese ships placed several buoys near the disputed islands. When asked by the Japanese media if the buoys could be used to track Japan's sophisticated submarines, Japan's defense minister said they could possibly be used to track ''vessels.''
Neither Mr. Abe nor Mr. Obama mentioned any real movement on the Okinawan base, one of the worst irritants in the two countries' relations. Yukio Hatoyama, a recent prime minister from a different political party, had briefly backed off on earlier Japanese promises to allow the base to be relocated to a less populated part of the island.

HEADLINE: Fear of U.S. Cuts Grows in States Where Aid Flows

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Fernanda Santos contributed reporting.

 BODY:
States are increasingly alarmed that they could become collateral damage in Washington's latest fiscal battle, fearing that the impasse could saddle them with across-the-board spending cuts that threaten to slow their fragile recoveries or thrust them back into recession.
Some states, like Maryland and Virginia, are vulnerable because their economies are heavily dependent on federal workers, federal contracts and military spending, which will face steep reductions if Congress allows the automatic cuts, known as sequestration, to begin next Friday. Others, including Illinois and South Dakota, are at risk because of their reliance on the types of federal grants that are scheduled to be cut. And many states simply fear that a heavy dose of federal austerity could weaken their economies, costing them jobs and much-needed tax revenue.
So as state officials begin to draw up their budgets for next year, some say that the biggest risk they see is not the weak housing market or the troubled European economy but the federal government. While the threat of big federal cuts to states has become something of a semiannual occurrence in recent years, state officials said in interviews that they fear that this time the federal government might not be crying wolf -- and their hopes are dimming that a deal will be struck in Washington in time to avert the cuts. 
The impact would be widespread as the cuts ripple across the nation over the next year.
Texas expects to see its education aid slashed hundreds of millions of dollars, which could force local school districts to fire teachers, if the cuts are not averted. Michigan officials say they are in no position to replace the lost federal dollars with state dollars, but worry about cuts to federal programs like the one that helps people heat their homes. Maryland is bracing not only for a blow to its economy, which depends on federal workers and contractors and the many private businesses that support them, but also for cuts in federal aid for schools, Head Start programs, a nutrition program for pregnant women, mothers and children, and job training programs, among others.
Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, a Republican, warned in a letter to President Obama on Monday that the automatic spending cuts would have a ''potentially devastating impact'' and could force Virginia and other states into a recession, noting that the planned cuts to military spending would be especially damaging to areas like Hampton Roads that have a big Navy presence. And he noted that the whole idea of the proposed cuts was that they were supposed to be so unpalatable that they would force officials in Washington to come up with a compromise.
''As we all know, the defense, and other, cuts in the sequester were designed to be a hammer, not a real policy,'' Mr. McDonnell wrote. ''Unfortunately, inaction by you and Congress now leaves states and localities to adjust to the looming threat of this haphazard idea.''
The looming cuts come just as many states feel they are turning the corner after the prolonged slump caused by the recession. Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, a Democrat, said he was moving to increase the state's cash reserves and rainy day funds as a hedge against federal cuts.
''I'd rather be spending those dollars on things that improve our business climate, that accelerate our recovery, that get more people back to work, or on needed infrastructure -- transportation, roads, bridges and the like,'' he said, adding that Maryland has eliminated 5,600 positions in recent years and that its government was smaller, on a per capita basis, than it had been in four decades. ''But I can't do that. I can't responsibly do that as long as I have this hara-kiri Congress threatening to drive a long knife through our recovery.''
Federal spending on salaries, wages and procurement makes up close to 20 percent of the economies of Maryland and Virginia, according to an analysis by the Pew Center on the States.
But states are in a delicate position. While they fear the impact of the automatic cuts, they also fear that any deal to avert them might be even worse for their bottom lines. That is because many of the planned cuts would go to military spending and not just domestic programs, and some of the most important federal programs for states, including Medicaid and federal highway funds, would be exempt from the cuts.
States will see a reduction of $5.8 billion this year in the federal grant programs subject to the automatic cuts, according to an analysis by Federal Funds Information for States, a group created by the National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures that tracks the impact of federal actions on states. California, New York and Texas stand to lose the most money from the automatic cuts, and Puerto Rico, which is already facing serious fiscal distress, is threatened with the loss of more than $126 million in federal grant money, the analysis found.
Even with the automatic cuts, the analysis found, states are still expected to get more federal aid over all this year than they did last year, because of growth in some of the biggest programs that are exempt from the cuts, including Medicaid.
But the cuts still pose a real risk to states, officials said. State budget officials from around the country held a conference call last week to discuss the threatened cuts. ''In almost every case the folks at the state level, the budget offices, are pretty much telling the agencies and departments that they're not going to backfill -- they're not going to make up for the budget cuts,'' said Scott D. Pattison, the executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, which arranged the call. ''They don't have enough state funds to make up for federal cuts.''
The cuts would not hit all states equally, the Pew Center on the States found. While the federal grants subject to the cuts make up more than 10 percent of South Dakota's revenue, it found, they make up less than 5 percent of Delaware's revenue.
Many state officials find themselves frustrated year after year by the uncertainty of what they can expect from Washington, which provides states with roughly a third of their revenues. There were threats of cuts when Congress balked at raising the debt limit in 2011, when a so-called super-committee tried and failed to reach a budget deal, and late last year when the nation faced the ''fiscal cliff.''
John E. Nixon, the director of Michigan's budget office, said that all the uncertainty made the state's planning more difficult. ''If it's going to happen,'' he said, ''at some point we need to rip off the Band-Aid.''

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THERE are always reasons not to buy stocks. Investors may think the Dow Jones industrial average is too high, as was the case in 1954 when the index topped 360. In 1941, there was Pearl Harbor. In 1962, the Cuban missile crisis. In 1997, the Asian financial crisis.
The list, adding up to 78 for each of the years from 1934 to 2012, was compiled by Bel Air Investment Advisors.
But the punch line to this list was that stocks went up by an annual compounded rate of 10.59 percent over those 78 years, with occasional plateaus, and that $1 million invested in 1934 was worth $2.4 billion in 2012.
As for the last three years, the list singled out the European financial crisis in 2010, the downgrade of United States' credit rating in 2011 and the political polarization of 2012. Investors were, in fact, generally reluctant to buy stocks. Yet in each of those years, stocks either rose in value or, at worst, were flat. 
The reason for such hesitancy is obvious. Investors are still scarred from the 2008 crash and they perceive stocks as risky, a feeling reinforced by a good bit of volatility in the markets in recent years. Yet as stocks rallied earlier this year, money from individual investors began to trickle back into equity funds. This could be good for an intrepid few.
''The stock market is the same place it was in 2000 with double the earnings,'' said Todd M. Morgan, senior managing director at Bel Air Investment Advisors. ''Stocks are set to outperform bonds over the next three to five years.''
This may very well be true, but most people still think fearfully about stocks. What would it take to get more people to buy stocks? And by this, I don't mean going all in as investors did in the late 1990s, but creating some semblance of a balanced portfolio.
Mr. Morgan and other advisers said that investors are being misled by talk about near-record levels for the Dow Jones and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index today. When adjusted for inflation, the levels approached earlier this year are not true highs. A new high for the Dow, for example, would be around 15,600.
What is more telling are the earnings and dividends of companies. Niall J. Gannon, executive director of wealth management at the Gannon Group at Morgan Stanley, calculated that the dividends on S.& P. 500 stocks were $15.97 in 2000 and $31.25 in 2012. Earnings per share were $56 in 2000 and $101 in 2012. In other words, two major measures of a stock's attractiveness have doubled in the last 12 years, but the index has not kept pace.
''A big mirage is going on in investors' minds,'' Mr. Gannon said. ''They think stocks are expensive because they've used index levels as the measure.''
And investors aren't confident that stocks will continue to rise, given the volatility in recent years. They may well fall in the short term, but over the next few years they are more likely to give investors a better return than bonds. Mr. Gannon pointed to an earnings yield on the S.& P. 500 of around 7 percent.
But these are rational arguments for individual companies. They do not account for concerns that the actions of the Federal Reserve have skewed stock prices, another rational fear.
Michael Sonnenfeldt, the founder of Tiger 21, an investment club whose members each have at least $10 million to invest, said the feeling from the group's annual conference was that the 14,000 level on the Dow was worrisome because it could be the result of all the money the Federal Reserve has put into the system and not based on company fundamentals.
The group, he said, was also worried that the Federal Reserve, having kept interest rates artificially low for so long, could have created a situation where investors suddenly demand higher interest rates at a government bond auction. A crisis like that could lead to deflation, and not inflation -- where stocks are considered a hedge.
What's telling is that Tiger 21 members reported increasing their allocation to equities by 3 percentage points in the last six months. ''It's not a stampede,'' he said. ''The focus has been on dividend-paying stocks, not growth stocks or tech stocks.''
For people with far less than $10 million to invest, the catalyst to buy stocks will probably be losing money in the bonds they own. ''Over the last three years, you've lost out not being in stocks,'' said Bernie Williams, vice president of discretionary money management at USAA Investments. ''But you still made money in bonds. From that perspective, investors are not really feeling the pain.''
There is an alternative view, of course, that says the unwillingness of people to invest in stocks now is completely normal and that what happened in the 1990s with stocks and in the 2000s with real estate were anomalies, at least for average investors.
''The alternative to investing or saving is spending today and that is always infinitely more pleasurable,'' said Don Phillips, president of investment research at Morningstar. ''Throughout the '80s and '90s, you had this amazing bull market and it gave you this immediate gratification that usually only spending gives you. Now we've been through a more realistic period, and people realize that is not always the case. The reward is deferred, and there may be severe losses.''
Mr. Phillips noted that if people were able to pick a winning stock 55 or 60 percent of the time, they would be remarkably successful. But in spending money on something they want today, their success rate is automatically 100 percent.
''I think for a mature American adult, investing should be an expectation,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''So much of the discussion around the recent tax increases is that investing is something only the 1 percent does. That fuels this mind-set that makes investing seem unrealistic for most people.''
Greg B. Davies, head of behavioral finance at Barclays Wealth and Investment Management, said people could persuade themselves to increase their allocation to equities by joining investment clubs where the group, in theory, would be better at making a decision that was painful. People could also slowly buy the stocks they want, a process called dollar-cost averaging.
''The classical economics position on all of this is that it is irrational and you should ignore it,'' Mr. Davies said. ''That's not very helpful advice. We do have an emotional response.''
He said he would instead encourage average investors to forget about maximizing their risk-adjusted returns and aim for their ''best anxiety-adjusted returns.''
For those with more fortitude, the simplest solution is to take the long view -- as in 10 or 20 years, which is a lot of delayed gratification.
''Whenever you're having a discussion like this, time horizon is a key consideration,'' said Bill Stromberg, head of global equities at T. Rowe Price. ''Most investors have been conditioned to think the next six to 12 months out. It's too hard for anyone to predict what's going to happen then.''
And while no one I spoke with expected stocks to return to double-digit returns year after year, a simple argument could be made for a return based on a dividend of 2 percent and earnings growth of 5 to 6 percent.
''That's not a home run for anyone, but it's better than you get in bonds,'' Mr. Stromberg said.
It is entirely possible that stocks will lose value across the board this year or the stocks you pick will fall significantly. But that is why every adviser stresses diversification and a long view. What matters is how a portfolio's returns look in a decade or two, not tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Reducing the Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman's strategy for economic recovery would accelerate our next, more predictable economic crisis because of excessive government debt (''Kick That Can,'' column, Feb. 8). 
The entire point of a bold, balanced and bipartisan deficit reduction plan that would be enacted immediately and phased in gradually is to stimulate job-creating economic confidence and to avoid otherwise inevitable austerity measures. The Congressional Budget Office's latest report indicates that $4 trillion in deficit reduction would grow, not slow, the economy by 1.7 percent by 2023.
But if nothing is done, unrestrained entitlement spending and skyrocketing interest payments will shrink our discretionary budget within the next decade to its smallest size (5.8 percent of gross domestic product) since such data were reported.
Especially for young people, kicking the fiscal can is an irresponsible prescription for more debt, fewer jobs, higher taxes and a lower standard of living.

HEADLINE: Arguing About the Keystone Pipeline

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I don't buy Joe Nocera's reasoning at all in his Feb. 19 column, ''How Not to Fix Climate Change,'' promoting the Keystone XL pipeline. Tar sands are among the dirtiest and highest polluting fuels, and they emit the most greenhouse gases. 
If this tar sands project isn't stopped, how are we ever to get a handle on climate change and air pollution? China is already asphyxiating its population with coal and is trying hard to alleviate the problem. I can't see the Chinese adding tar sands to the misery of their people and risking popular protests.
RICHARD L. OTTINGER White Plains, Feb. 19, 2013
The writer is dean emeritus of the Pace University Law School and a former Democratic member of the House of Representatives from New York.
To the Editor:
Joe Nocera wisely counsels opponents of the Keystone pipeline, ''The emphasis should be on demand, not supply.'' But he concluded with an economic clunker.
As he notes, the likely outcome of blocking Keystone would be a pipeline to British Columbia to export the oil to China. If the First Nations block that pipeline, the next option would be conversion of an existing gas pipeline to the United States. But even if the oil sands are shut in, demand will not decline.
The oil will most likely be replaced with Saudi heavy oil. Carbon emissions, from production to combustion, will only be about 10 percent lower. As Mr. Nocera suggests, we should reduce demand. But he dismisses a carbon tax because it could ''make the expensive tar sands oil more viable.'' No. A carbon tax would make oil sands and coal less viable and also reduce demand. That's the way to go.
JOHN A. RIGGS Washington, Feb. 19, 2013
The writer is a senior fellow at the Aspen Institute. His views are his own.
To the Editor:
The logic in the argument by Joe Nocera in support of the Keystone pipeline appears to be flawless. The United States needs oil, the tar sands supply it, and give us jobs to boot.
The big flaw is that increased carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere because of fossil fuel burning enhances global warming. This correlation is well established in the scientific literature. The ensuing, ever-increasing ravages of storms, floods and fire will exact a huge human and economic toll. The naysayers deny this, but they'll regret it 20 years from now.

HEADLINE: No Exit: China Uses Passports as Political Cudgel

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Patrick Zuo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Flush with cash and eager to see the world, millions of middle-class Chinese spent the 10-day Lunar New Year holiday that ended on Monday in places like Paris, Bangkok and New York. Last year, Chinese made a record 83 million trips abroad, 20 percent more than in 2011 and a fivefold increase from a decade earlier.
Sun Wenguang, a retired economics professor from Shandong Province, was not among those venturing overseas, however. And not by choice. An author whose books offer a critical assessment of Communist Party rule, Mr. Sun, 79, has been repeatedly denied a passport without explanation.
''I'd love to visit my daughter in America and my 90-year-old brother in Taiwan, but the authorities have other ideas,'' he said. ''I feel like I'm living in a cage.'' 
Mr. Sun is among the legions of Chinese who have been barred from traveling abroad by a government that is increasingly using decisions on passports as a cudgel against perceived enemies -- or as a carrot to encourage academics whose writings have at times strayed from the party line to return to the fold.
''It's just another way to punish people they don't like,'' said Wu Zeheng, a government critic and Buddhist spiritual leader from southern Guangdong Province whose failed entreaties to obtain a passport have prevented him from accepting at least a dozen speaking invitations in Europe and North America.
China's passport restrictions extend to low-level military personnel, Tibetan monks and even the security personnel who process passport applications. ''I feel so jealous when I see all my friends taking vacations in Singapore or Thailand but the only way I could join them is to quit my job,'' said a 28-year-old police detective in Beijing.
Lawyers and human rights advocates say the number of those affected has soared in recent years, with Tibetans and Uighurs, the Turkic-speaking minority from China's far west, increasingly ineligible for overseas fellowships, speaking engagements or the organized sightseeing groups that have ferried planeloads of Chinese to foreign capitals.
Although the government does not release figures on those who have been denied passports, human rights groups suggest that at least 14 million people -- mostly those officially categorized as ethnic Uighurs and Tibetans -- have been directly affected by the restrictions, as have hundreds of religious and political dissidents. A representative of the Exit-Entry Administration of the Public Security Bureau declined to discuss the nation's passport policies.
The seemingly arbitrary restrictions, not unlike those long employed by the former Soviet Union, also affect overseas Chinese who had grown accustomed to frequent visits home. Scores of Chinese expatriates have been denied new passports by Chinese Embassies when their old ones expire, while others say they are simply turned away after landing in Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong.
Returnees whose names show up on a blacklist are escorted by border control officers to the next outbound flight. Even if seldom given explanations for their expulsions, many of those turned away suspect it is punishment for their antigovernment activism abroad. ''Compared to other forms of political persecution, the denial of the right to return home seems like a small evil,'' said Hu Ping, the editor of a pro-democracy journal in New York who has not been allowed to see family members in China since 1987. ''But it's a blatant violation of human rights.''
Even those carrying valid passports are subject to the whims of the authorities. On Feb. 6, Wang Zhongxia, 28, a Chinese activist who had planned to meet the Burmese opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, was barred from boarding a Myanmar-bound flight from the southern city of Guangzhou. Four days earlier, Ilham Tohti, an academic and vocal advocate for China's ethnic Uighurs, was prevented from leaving for the United States.
Mr. Tohti, who was set to begin a yearlong fellowship at Indiana University, said he was interrogated at Beijing International Airport for nearly 12 hours by officers who refused to explain his detention. Speaking from his apartment in the capital, Mr. Tohti says that Uighurs have long faced difficulties in obtaining passports but that the authorities have made it nearly impossible in recent years.
''We feel like second-class citizens in our own country,'' he said.
For decades after the Communists came to power in 1949, most Chinese could only dream of traveling abroad; the handful who managed to leave often escaped by evading border guards and swimming across shark-infested waters to what was then British-ruled Hong Kong. As China opened up to the outside world in the early 1980s, the government began providing passports and exit visas to graduate students who had acceptance letters from universities overseas.
All that changed in 1991, when Beijing issued new rules allowing Chinese to join group tours to ''approved destinations'' in Southeast Asia, and two years later, to the United States and Europe. These days, members of China's ethnic Han majority can generally obtain a passport in 15 days.
But the rules are more arduous for Tibetans and Uighurs, who must win approvals from several layers of bureaucracy -- including provincial authorities; the applicant's hometown public security bureau; and for students, university administrators. Tsering Woeser, a Tibetan writer who has tried and failed to get a passport since 2005, says the denials are driven by fears that once abroad, minorities will speak out about China's repressive ethnic policies or link up with exile groups.
''For the Han, getting a passport is as easy as buying a bus ticket,'' she said. ''But for Tibetans it's harder than climbing to the sky.''
Since last April, the authorities have been confiscating passports from Tibetans lucky enough to have them in the first place. According to documents obtained by Human Rights Watch, the police in Tibet are also required to interrogate returnees and determine whether they have broken a signed pledge not to engage in activities that ''harm state security and interests'' while outside the country.
The new procedures were introduced after thousands of Tibetans attended a religious gathering in India that included an appearance by the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader whom Beijing considers a separatist. Tibetan exiles say the restrictions also seek to limit information about the recent spate of self-immolations from reaching the outside world.
The frustrations of those affected by the tightened rules received a rare public airing after a 21-year-old Uighur college student blogged about her unsuccessful attempt to get a passport. The student, Atikem Rozi, said the repeated rejections had dashed her hopes to study abroad.
''Whenever the subject of a passport is mentioned, it brings me to tears,'' Ms. Rozi, a student at Minzu University in Beijing, wrote last month. ''My passport is still a riddle, a luxury.''
Widely forwarded, the blog posts prompted favorable coverage in one Chinese publication. But they also drew unwanted attention from the domestic security agents in Xinjiang, who during six hours of questioning this month suggested that she was ''politically unqualified'' to go abroad because she had used her microblog, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, to complain about discrimination against Uighurs.
The inability to travel has driven many Chinese to take desperate measures. In 2011, Liao Yiwu, a poet and author from the southwest city of Chengdu, escaped overland to Vietnam after the authorities rebuffed his passport application more than a dozen times and then threatened him over plans to publish a book overseas. He now lives in exile in Germany.
Wu'er Kaixi, who was No. 2 on the government's most wanted list after he organized student protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, has spent the last several years trying to get himself arrested by the Chinese authorities in an attempt to return home to see his aging parents. Mr. Kaixi, who lives in Taiwan, has tried crashing through the gates of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, and he once flew to Chinese-administered Macau and offered himself up to the police. He was promptly put back on a plane and sent home.
''It is unbearable to contemplate the idea that I may never see them again,'' he wrote last year of his parents, who have also been barred from leaving China. ''This is barbaric and cruel behavior by the Chinese government.''

HEADLINE: A Proposal for a Propane Tank Looms Large Over a Maine Coastal Town

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
SEARSPORT, Me. -- In the winter of 2007, thousands of homes and businesses in rural Maine almost lost their heat because of a severe propane shortage.
The shortage led to rationing and prompted Gov. John Baldacci to scramble for a solution, including asking DCP Midstream, a Denver company that already supplied propane to New England, to help increase imports to guard against future disruptions, company officials said.
Now, six years later, DCP has finally obtained approval from all government agencies -- save one -- to build a $50 million import terminal in this tiny port town in midcoast Maine. It would include a liquid petroleum storage tank that would stand 14 stories high, almost the height of the Statue of Liberty from the top of its base to the torch, making it one of the largest of its kind in the country.
But a funny thing happened during the lengthy governmental approval process -- the energy industry, flush with gas from hydraulic fracturing in the nation's shale fields, did a U-turn and has cut back on imports in favor of exports. 
''There has not been a ship that has brought propane into New England in almost a year,'' said Joe Rose, the president and chief executive of the Propane Gas Association of New England. ''At this point, the facilities in New England are in a state of being semi-mothballed.''
Despite the drastic change in the market, DCP officials say they still want to build a terminal for imports. Markets fluctuate, they point out, and by the time the tank would be built, in two years, New England could again be seeking imports.
Talk of the proposed tank has consumed Searsport, population 2,800, and the surrounding region. The project has many supporters, who say it will bring much-needed jobs and provide a major economic infusion. It also has many detractors, who say the 23 million-gallon tank will pose a constant danger -- that an explosion could release as much energy as 33 Hiroshima-size atomic bombs -- and blight the coastline, lower property values and drive away tourists.
Opponents, under the umbrella group Thanks but No Tank, are challenging the tank in court as their options for blocking it through the governmental process dwindle. DCP has already received permits and approvals from the necessary state and federal agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers.
The last hurdle is the Searsport Planning Board, a five-member board of volunteers. The board held five hearings in November and expected to wrap up shortly afterward.
But the hearings took on a life of their own and have continued. By now, there have been 10, most of them lasting four hours. Townspeople pack into the high school cafeteria on bitterly cold nights and sit through the sessions hour after hour. Some bring their knitting. Others watch the hearings later online, like a mini-series.
The hearings are replete with expert witnesses and courtroom theatrics. Both sides have inundated the board with mounds of technical data, much of it conflicting. This has prompted the board to order its own studies and hire its own advisers to help it wade through terms like ''bleve,'' which rhymes with Chevy and stands for ''boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion.''
The hearings are run by J. Bruce Probert, 75, who has been the chairman of the planning board for 35 years. He is a methodical type, but he said in an interview that the initial hearings made him so anxious that he did not sleep for several nights and lost 12 pounds in a week.
''Running the hearings is like flying a helicopter,'' he said. ''There's a lot going on at once.''
One more hearing has been scheduled for Monday. After another round of written submissions, the board will begin its deliberations, in public. Its final decision is expected in March or April, though it is likely to be appealed and to leave the town cleaved.
Supporters note that Searsport has long encouraged development of this sort and has zoned an industrial area for it. The new tank would sit near an already existing ''tank farm'' of 30 smaller, less visible tanks. Supporters say the project would bring 100 construction jobs and a dozen permanent jobs that would each pay up to $56,000 a year, along with benefits. They also say it would contribute significantly to the local tax base.
''When you see those ships coming in, that's money coming in, and it trickles down to everybody,'' said Kathleen Garrold, 54, a medical secretary who grew up here.
She said she had faith in the company's assertions that the tank did not pose a hazard, recalling that a company witness, Phani K. Raj, had said the tank would be perfectly safe. A ''bleve,'' he testified, was ''impossible.''
Others say a bleve is indeed possible. ''They said Fukushima was safe, and they said the 9/11 towers were never going to fall,'' said Tom Gocze, 60, whose waterfront home looks out on the proposed site. ''But things happen.''
Mere discussion of the tank, real estate agents have testified, has already driven away prospective home buyers. And opponents believe that if the tank were to be built, tourists would no longer visit the town's stately old bed and breakfasts, once the homes of sea captains, or pitch tents at the oceanside campgrounds on nearby Sears Island.
''The people from New Jersey who want lobster aren't coming here to eat in the shadow of that tank,'' said Bud Hall, who owns Anglers Restaurant and the adjacent Bait's Motel, which sit 400 feet from the proposed site, within the ''blast zone.''
So far, DCP has won each test along the way. They persuaded the town to more than double its building height limit to 150 feet accommodate the 138-foot-high tank.
In March 2012, opponents sought to stop the process by calling for a moratorium. DCP adopted campaign-style tactics to defeat it. ''DCP opened an office on Main Street and hired 8 to 10 people at $100 a day to go door-to-door to hand out leaflets in favor of the tank,'' The Free Press of Rockland wrote. Voters rejected the moratorium, 297 to 165.
To help build their case, opponents at the Islesboro Islands Trust hired Richard A. Clarke, a former White House national security adviser, who runs a security risk management firm, to conduct a risk assessment of the proposal. Mr. Clarke's report recommended that the planning board deny the company its permit, saying the tank provided ''too great a risk to the community.'' It said that the site was too small, that neighbors were too close and that the region was not prepared, in terms of emergency personnel or financially, to respond if a major problem occurred.
He also addressed the changed market, warning that because of the lack of imports, the facility ''may become a shuttered eyesore, unable to financially support the emergency response augmentation that building the facility requires.''
Stephen Hinchman, a lawyer for the opponents, said he believed that instead of shutting the plant, DCP would convert it for exports. That would mean ships year-round, with many more trucks and rail cars, all of which would cause more disruption to the town and create more chances for accidents.
Company officials have said that converting the terminal would be difficult, but they have not unequivocally ruled it out.
''We maintain we have no intent on developing this as an export terminal,'' Rosslyn Elliott, a spokeswoman for DCP, wrote in an e-mail. ''It is designed for import. If anything changes, it would require significant redesign and repermitting. That's not a light undertaking. Again, we view this in long-term value, not short-term cyclical highs and lows.''

HIGHLIGHT: Bank&#8217;s downfall in Italy; European growth stumbles; more horse meat fallout, and David Lynch branches out. 

 BODY:
 NEWS Since the days of the Medici family in Florence, the banking house of Monte dei Paschi has rained wealth on the people of Siena, Italy. For 541 years, it has endured war, plague and panic, and it stands today as the world's oldest operating bank. But inside the stately offices of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a thoroughly modern fiasco has done what the centuries could not. Monte dei Paschi, founded in 1472, has been brought to its knees by 21st-century finance. Jack Ewing and Gaia Pianigiani report from Siena. 
Despite growing confidence that Europe is managing its debt crisis and is poised to embark on a recovery, fresh developments on Friday indicated that the region continues to struggle to stimulate growth while cutting spending to pare deficits. James Kanter reports from Brussels.
Alcatel-Lucent, the struggling French telecommunications equipment maker, on Friday hired a former Vodafone and France Télécom executive, Michel Combes, to lead the company through what might be a major downsizing. Mr. Combes, 51, will take over for Ben Verwaayen, who had failed in four years to bring the equipment maker, created by the 2006 merger of Alcatel of France and Lucent Technologies of New Jersey, to sustained profit. Kevin J. O'Brien reports from Berlin.
Another big food producer was ensnared in the scandal over horse meat in beef products Friday when the company that owns the Iglo and Birds Eye brands withdrew a dozen types of prepared meals from stores in four European countries. The Iglo Foods Group, the parent company, said it took the action after a chili con carne dish, produced by a Belgian company called Frigilunch and on sale in Belgium, was found to contain about 2 percent horse meat. Stephen Castle reports from London.
A deadly attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last month has dealt a major setback to a group of North African countries whose prospects as oil and gas producers were already cloudy. Both oil and natural gas production have been in decline in Algeria, the region's biggest gas producer, since the mid-2000s. In Libya, the rebellion that ousted Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and its chaotic aftermath have disrupted oil and gas exploration. In Egypt, rising domestic consumption, encouraged by government policies, has cut into exports.Stanley Reed reports from London.
 ARTS The director David Lynch has released a musical album, exhibited his artwork, designed a nightclub and worked tirelessly for T.M. What he has not been doing is making movies. Claire Hoffman reports from Los Angeles.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, a look at the president&#8217;s weekly address and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
President Obama's re-election campaign is being transformed into a powerhouse national advocacy network with few clear rules, ample potential for influence peddling and no precedent in national politics, Nicholas Confessore reports. The goal is to harness Mr. Obama's extensive voter database and technological infrastructure in support of his second-term policy priorities, including gun violence, climate change and immigration.
 

        
The White House warned of potentially severe disruptions in air travel if across-the-board spending cuts take effect on March 1, showing that the Obama administration believes that the threat of widespread problems could sway the public and encourage voters to force Republicans to the bargaining table, Jonathan Weisman and Michael D. Shear report.

        
Advocates for illegal immigrants are demanding that the White House stop what has become one of the most aggressive and efficient efforts in decades to deport those who are in the country unlawfully, Michael D. Shear reports. Activists say they are being forced out at exactly the wrong moment - when the promise of eventual United States citizenship could be around the corner.

        
Though it fell short of a full state visit, President Obama met with Shinzo Abe, Japan's new prime minister, at the White House on Friday to discuss their mutual interests in curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions, expanding trade and keeping peace among Pacific nations, Jackie Calmes writes.
 Weekly Address 

        
President Obama described improving the economy and creating jobs as items that should be topping the country's agenda. "And yet, less than one week from now, Congress is poised to allow a series of arbitrary, automatic budget cuts that will do the exact opposite," he said. "They will slow our economy. They will eliminate good jobs. They will leave many families who are already stretched to the limit scrambling to figure out what to do." He asked for Congress to come to a compromise that would stave off the cuts, and to work together in reducing the deficit "with smart spending cuts, entitlement reform and tax reform." He said his plan comes with just one requirement: "Democrats and Republicans to meet halfway to resolve the problem."
 Happenings in Washington 

        
President Obama, Michelle Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Dr. Jill Biden will host the 2013 Governors' Dinner at the White House on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Sandberg, Feminism and the Politics of Class

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Sheryl Sandberg&#8217;s &#8220;Lean In&#8221; movement has already inspired many debates, including the role of government in helping achieve equality. Add your voice. 

 BODY:
Sheryl Sandberg, perhaps the country's most prominent female tech executive, aspires to share her secrets through success via a new social movement. 
But while her prescriptions for women to "Lean In" to their careers involve personal choices and mind-sets, critics say that her prescriptions, which call for women to learn how to compete better without naming a role for government, reflect a privileged perspective that fails to see beyond the mansions of Silicon Valley, where capitalism is king.
The debate over the politics of class played out on NYTimes.com and Facebook in reaction to Jodi Kantor's Friday article. Here are some excerpted highlights of the discussion; join in here. 
I haven't read whether or not this woman worked her way through her degrees, or was burdened by college debt. I have no doubt that she's intelligent but I know a lot of intelligent women who are struggling because of college debt and an economy that makes degrees almost useless. If she wants to create a movement (the ego implication is astounding) she should be setting up something like Pell Grants or other ways to help women become successful. I'm pretty sure that lectures on (once again) what we're doing wrong, aren't going to help.
 - ellen, L.A., C.A.
I welcome Ms. Sandburg's perspective. So what if she is now rich, or that she is smart. Male CEOs write business self-help books all the time and no one comes down on them for being too rich or smart. ...
Too often women in the workplace lack mentors to help navigate the parts of the workplace that has to do with everything other than doing a good job. We too often work too hard, erroneously assuming that simply doing a good job will earn us the reward. ...
Without the support of government, corporations and society as a whole, women can't hope to achieve what they could without such support. We should work on that also, but it doesn't obviate the need to be effective in our personal interactions in the workplace as well.
 - Sandy Lynn, Illinois
Will the consciousness-raising group offer backup childcare? And make sure they don't schedule meetings the same night as mandatory basketball tryouts? Even though the McKinsey consultants are helping my husband's boss compile this year's 'yank and rank' layoff list, I"ll remind him to leave work early so I won't miss my meeting.
 - mw, New York
I feel very lucky in that my parents could afford to send me to college, I am white, and I started investing early. All you ladies out there, sexism is bad enough; just wait until ageism is thrown in. References to being "technologically challenged," when I am the only one in the office able to pick up a phone and sell $50,000 worth of product in one call. Being referred to as a "mother hen," when the younger women are in tears in the bathroom. Being told "don't break a hip" when you go out into an ice storm.
Save your money now; max out your (401)k, put aside $50-$100 a month and live within your means if at all possible. That's my advice.
 - Marie, Vail
As a 50-year-old woman graduating from college with a Bachelor of Science degree in advertising and public relations this coming May, this article was of particular interest. I am starting a new chapter of my life after raising a family. Sandberg's insistence that women could get ahead if only they worked harder is reminiscent of views of blacks in the 1970s. This statement rubs women, who work hard, raise families and live well-rounded lives, the wrong way. The fact that Sandberg has "help" to maintain her household and raise her children makes her lifestyle foreign to the majority of women in the United States.
 - Lori F., Lebanon, Mo.
I can only cheer this on, but the criticism of Freidan was that her movement was, if not elitist, then only for middle class women who could afford the leisure to cultivate feminist philosophy. Sandberg appears even more vulnerable to criticism. It can be said that she followed a male pathway to success, using feminist rhetoric. This proves the efficacy of the male pathway. Those who always thought the equal does not mean identical, will not be accepting. Those who still suffer inequality may not identify with Ms. Sandberg. Perhaps she could relinquish her pinnacle.
 - welshmx, alaska
I say good for her - I hope these smart, wealthy privileged women keep talking to themselves - and then when they are done talking - do something important - like run for President of the United States and win.
Because I think for women it is going to be "top down" progress or nothing at all...

HEADLINE: In the Wake of Emancipation

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER HAGER


HIGHLIGHT: Even after Lincoln&#8217;s action, for men and women still in slavery things could get worse before they got better. 

 BODY:
For many enslaved people, 1863 began not with freedom but with profound uncertainty. The legal and practical effects of the Emancipation Proclamation were a matter of dispute among white critics and observers, as they have been among historians for 150 years. If the proclamation applied only to areas under Confederate control, did it really free anyone right away? What, if anything, did it mean for border states and Union-occupied territory? For slaves who got their news in rumors, the proclamation's details could seem especially unclear. As late as the summer of 1864, an enslaved woman in Maryland, Annie Davis, wrote to Lincoln himself for clarification: "Mr president," she asked, "please let me know if we are free." 
For men and women still in slavery - and still vulnerable to the abuses of southern masters angered by Lincoln's action - things could get worse before they got better. On Feb. 23, 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was not yet two months old, an enslaved man on a plantation near New Orleans wrote a letter to Nathaniel P. Banks, the Union general occupying the city. Gorgener Roman plainly had little education, but he knew some of the niceties of letter-writing: "I Gorgener Roman," he began, "wright a fue lines to ask you if you will be so kind as to send some one to my assistence as soon as posable."
Roman had been in prison for about two months (he did not say why) until "one of the fideral ofecers paid me a visit." The jail keeper told Roman's owner about this visit, and the owner evidently was displeased. Roman peremptorily "wasent down on borgars pantation to be struck twenty five lashes and then to be put in chaines." Although his language had been proper and polite near the beginning of the letter, it became urgent and desperate toward the end: "I know that I will not be able to endure such cruel treatments. . . . I beg you for God sak pleas to sen some as soo as posable before they kill me."
The southern parishes of Louisiana were among the places Lincoln's proclamation had formally exempted. Despite the Union Army's control of the area, it remained legal to own slaves there. Nevertheless, the northern military occupation had seriously undermined the institution of slavery. The army had begun enlisting free black men in 1862, but many fugitive slaves found that Union recruiters, eager to fill their ranks, didn't pry too deeply into a man's legal status. Gorgener Roman's owner had good reason to believe the federal officer visiting the jail wanted to get Roman out of slavery and into the army. And the Lincoln administration's embrace of emancipation likely intensified the owner's recriminations. Any Yankee in uniform was now a practical abolitionist.
Even though someone like Gorgener Roman still was not free - could be beaten perhaps more brutally now than he had been when slavery was intact - something had changed in the wake of the Emancipation Proclamation. He could write a letter of protest. Most southern blacks were illiterate, owing to the slave South's longstanding prohibitions on education for African Americans. But an estimated 5 to 10 percent of slaves - 200,000 or more - were literate at the outbreak of the Civil War. As the war progressed and slavery crumbled, the prohibitions fell away. White northern missionaries and free blacks opened schoolrooms. Thousands more of the newly freed got the chance to learn.
No matter how and when Gorgener Roman learned to write, it would have taken the sea changes of early 1863 for him to believe writing a letter could make a difference. Only six years earlier, the United States Supreme Court had declared in its Dred Scott decision that African-Americans had "no rights which the white man was bound to respect." Now, a Louisiana slave could set to work with a pen and a piece of paper - probably no small task for someone like Roman - convinced his petition would not fall on deaf ears. It is unknown whether General Banks took any action on Roman's behalf; what's striking is that Roman believed his plight would matter to a powerful white man. 
Across the South, as the tide of emancipation rose, African Americans were finding that the authority of slave owners was being replaced by the authority of the United States government - military officers, politicians, agents of the Freedmen's Bureau. White northerners did not always have freed people's best interests at heart, to be sure, but they were at least supposed to take those interests seriously. So, from the pens of former slaves, whom many white people had presumed were illiterate, came reams of written grievances. By the end of the war, a Freedmen's Bureau official could refer (with exasperation) to the flood of "letter-writing [and] petitioning" that residents of a single North Carolina freed people's camp had generated.
In the scores of such writings that survive - and, doubtless, the hundreds or thousands that have been lost to history - black southerners, though barely literate, worked out the ideas and the rhetoric that would stoke the struggle for civil rights for decades to come. Black soldiers poorly treated by the army called out hypocrisy: "Wee are said to be U S Soldiers and behold wee are U S Slaves." Freedmen declared the need for economic opportunity: "the people wont to work they are willing to work they are redy to work & will work, as sure as a liveing offerd is made, to them." The newly liberated sensed the stakes for the future of the race: "if we Ever Expect to be a Pepple & if we Dont Reply to some one of a thourety we Shall for Ever be Troden Down under foot of man." And, with keen scrutiny, they measured the reality of emancipation - indeed, of the nation - against its promise. When a committee of freedmen in Tuscaloosa detailed the abuses their community suffered in the first months after the war, they concluded by saying: "This is not the persuit of happa ness."

HEADLINE: Calling Out the Robocaller

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
LAST month, the Haggler was sitting at home when the phone rang.
''This is your second and final notice,'' intoned the stern voice of a robocaller. This vaguely threatening opener segued quickly into a lilting spiel about credit cards and consolidation. Something about an offer to lower rates? It was hard to tell, but when the Haggler heard he could press 1 for more information, naturally, he pressed 1.
After a pause, a man introduced himself as Robert, and offered the services of Account Management Assistance. It was hard to tell exactly what A.M.A. was selling, but the Haggler was assured it would cost him nothing and reduce his credit card interest payments. 
''Sure, I'm interested,'' quoth the Haggler, hoping to draw out some information. But Robert was soon spooked by this softball question: ''Where are you guys located?''
Click.
Intrigued, the Haggler typed A.M.A.'s phone number -- captured on caller ID -- into a Web site called 800notes.com, which provides a forum for those on the receiving end of unwanted calls. On pages dedicated to 855-462-3833, the Haggler found dozens of complaints, and many of those complainers had signed up for A.M.A.'s service. The company had charged as much as $2,000, promising to negotiate lower credit card rates with banks.
There were no satisfied customers.
''They got me too!'' wrote one. ''Lying freaks,'' wrote another.
So the Haggler posted an invitation on the site, asking anyone disappointed by A.M.A. to get in touch. A week later, an e-mail arrived from Anna Mikiewicz of Palatine, Ill.
''The whole experience is enough to put someone in an early grave,'' she wrote. ''I've been run through the mill.''
Ms. Mikiewicz outlined how she'd been charged $1,000 by A.M.A. For her money, the company signed her up for a credit card that offered zero percent interest for a limited period, something she could have done herself, free. Her attempts to get a refund included dozens of calls, to a variety of employees at A.M.A., as well as unsuccessful efforts to persuade government bodies to investigate. Because A.M.A. gives its address as a post office box in Orlando, that included Florida's attorney general's office and Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
Nobody had helped.
Now it was the Haggler's turn. Ms. Mikiewicz said that a man named Mark Dowell was the manager at A.M.A., and suggested that calls begin with him.
''May I speak to Mark Dowell?'' the Haggler said, after dialing 407-480-4489, a number A.M.A. had provided to Ms. Mikiewicz back when they were speaking.
''He's gone for the day,'' replied a receptionist.
''Can you leave him a message?'' said the Haggler.
''Hold, please,'' she said.
''Who are you looking for?'' she then asked.
''Mark Dowell.''
''We don't have a Mark Dowell. We have a Mark Dolan. What company are you trying to reach?''
''Account Management Assistance.''
''You've got the wrong number.''
''Well, what company is this?''
''I can't give out that information.''
''Really? How come?''
''It's not in my job description.''
''Well, it's not in my job description either. But I still tell people where I work.''
''What town is the company you're trying to reach?''
''Orlando.''
''O.K. We're Elephant Inc. We're based in Hawaii.''
The next day, the Haggler called the same number, asking for Mark Dowell.
''He's on the line with another customer. Would you like to leave a message?''
The Haggler did, twice, and has never heard back.
IT turns out that A.M.A. doesn't have a Web site, and, other than that post office box, doesn't seem to exist in physical space. Nonetheless, there are clues about who may be behind this operation. The Better Business Bureau has a page for a Florida company called Your Financial Ladder -- which gets an ''F'' grade, by the way -- that seems to do business as Account Management Assistance, as well as other names, including Economic Progress Inc.
Economic Progress, according to a 2012 Florida incorporation filing, is operated by Brenda Helfenstine. She and her husband, Tony, ran into some trouble last year. The attorney general of Arkansas sued Your Financial Ladder, and four other companies, accusing them of violating the Telemarketing Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, among other laws. He named Brenda and Tony Helfenstine and accused their company of making illegal robocalls and assessing fees to consumers without providing promised aid.
So the Haggler called the Helfenstines, whose phone number was dug up by a Times researcher, Jack Styczynski, and left a message. Tony Helfenstine returned that call, but after follow-up calls, he went silent.
''This is your second and final notice,'' the Haggler wisecracked on the Helfenstines' answering machine, to his own great amusement. Nothing.
What about those government agencies? Well, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services says it recently started an investigation of Your Financial Ladder that ended uneventfully after an inspector was dispatched to the contact address listed on the company's Web site, 1760 Sundance Drive, in St. Cloud.
''The inspector noted that the address was a residence and that there was no evidence of a telemarketing operation at the time,'' wrote Amanda Bevis, a spokeswoman for the department. ''The investigation had reached a dead end.''
Actually, the investigation had reached the home of Brenda and Tony Helfenstine. Seriously, that address, according to easily accessible public records, is where the Helfenstines seem to live.
Deep breaths, people. Yes, it's maddening that our consumer protection agencies are so easily foiled. Or unmotivated. Perhaps they need a nudge. So, dear readers, the Haggler cordially invites you to contact Adam Putnam, commissioner of Florida's consumer services department, on Twitter at @adamputnam, and Pam Bondi, Florida's attorney general, at @AGPamBondi. Tell them you care. And stay tuned.
E-mail: haggler@nytimes.com Keep it brief and family-friendly, include your hometown and go easy on the caps-lock key. Letters may be edited for clarity and length.

HEADLINE: In Italy, Illusion Is the Only Reality

BYLINE: By TIM PARKS. 
A novelist and translator and the author of the forthcoming book ''Italian Ways: On and Off the Rails From Milan to Palermo.''

 BODY:
IT takes a certain talent to live in happy denial, to slide toward the edge of a precipice and be perfectly relaxed about it. Of all the talents that Italians are renowned for, such nonchalance is perhaps their greatest. Their economy is in deep recession; more than one in three young adults are unemployed; they are unable to compete economically with their neighbors; yet they continue as if nothing were happening, or as if a small glitch in the dolce vita could be fixed with the wave of a wand.
In particular, whether in awe or horror, they continue to be enchanted by the pied piper Silvio Berlusconi, the former and perhaps future prime minister and fabulously wealthy media magnate. In the run-up to the elections that begin today, he has promised to abolish the stiff property tax that was introduced by the previous government and is largely responsible for bringing a little credibility back to the country's finances (and that he voted for himself when it was introduced). Not only would he abolish it, but he would actually pay back what Italians paid on it last year.
The announcement, despite coming from a man who has repeatedly failed to turn even the most promising political and economic circumstances into anything resembling the collective good, earned Mr. Berlusconi a considerable leap in the polls. 
I have lived in Italy for 32 years. One of the first things that struck me was the relation between action and consequence, which is different in the other countries I knew, Britain and the United States. Here someone is found to have abused their position of public office -- given jobs to relatives, accepted bribes, spent public money on personal pleasures -- but does not resign, does not think of resigning, attacks the moralists and sails on regardless.
Statistics show that tax evasion is endemic, and the more so the more one moves south, to the point that around Naples, dentists declare lower incomes than policemen. Needless to say, the fiscal shortfall has to be made up with government borrowing and higher taxes for those who do pay.
Meanwhile, though sports is glaringly corrupt, fans are as passionate as ever. As the owner of the big soccer club A. C. Milan, Mr. Berlusconi decided, at the beginning of his campaign, to buy the star striker Mario Balotelli. Again he was rewarded in the opinion polls.
The constant discrepancy between how one might expect things to pan out and how they actually do is nothing new. On a tour through Italy in 1869, Mark Twain wrote, ''I can not understand how a bankrupt Government can have such palatial railroad depots.''
Things don't change. Italy recently completed Europe's fastest train service; one can travel the 360 miles from Milan to Rome nonstop in just 2 hours and 45 minutes. In a country with a huge debt, this wonderful engineering feat has cost an astonishing 150 billion euros (about $200 billion).
Nobody seems sure where the investment came from or how the project will be paid for. One thing is certain: much of the money that legally should have been allotted to local services must have found its way to the high-speed project; to accommodate the few going fast, hosts of working people grind to the office in dirty, overcrowded trains. But what matters is the gleaming image of progress that the service projects.
Benito Mussolini, perhaps the first great propagandist of the modern era, understood perfectly this aspect of Italian psychology. ''It is faith which moves mountains because it gives the illusion that mountains move,'' he said. ''Illusion is perhaps the only reality in life.''
On Jan. 27, at a ceremony for the national Holocaust remembrance day, Mr. Berlusconi felt it was the right time to say that Mussolini had actually done many good things and was not such a bad guy. He was rewarded with another upward twitch in the opinion polls.
It is the constant impression of people outside Italy that Mr. Berlusconi is some kind of evil buffoon and that the vast majority of Italians repudiate him. They cannot understand how a man so constantly on trial for all kinds of corruption, a man with a huge conflict of interest (he owns three national TV channels and large chunks of the country's publishing industry), remains at the center of power.
The answer, aside from the extraordinarily slow and complex judiciary and a distressing lack of truly independent journalism, is that Mr. Berlusconi's political instincts mesh perfectly with the collective determination not to face the truth, which again combines with deep fear that a more serious leader might ask too much of them. One of the things he has promised is a pardon for tax evaders. Only in a country where tax evasion is endemic can one appeal to evaders at the expense of those who actually pay taxes.
The mirror image of Mr. Berlusconi might be the caretaker prime minister Mario Monti, an unelected professor of economics, who took over in late 2011, in the middle of the euro crisis. Foreign observers are convinced Mr. Monti did a great job and deserves re-election; this is naïve. As many Italians see it (and I agree), the professor merely bowed to pressure from Berlin, cut spending where there was least resistance and taxed everybody without regard to income. His election campaign, based on a rhetoric of dour seriousness, has been disappointing. As a colleague remarked, if one is to be fleeced by the government anyway, better the entertainer than the pedant.
One entertainer seeking to capitalize on the situation is Beppe Grillo, a rowdy ex-comedian-turned-political blogger whose Five Star Movement proposes to sweep away the corrupt political order and promises a utopia of salaries for the unemployed and a 30-hour workweek. Mr. Grillo's style is so demagogical and his party so dependent on his inflammatory charisma that the 20 percent of the electorate supposedly planning to vote for him must surely have decided that it simply does not matter if the country is ungovernable after the elections.
Alternately, it may be that people feel that nothing can be done anyway, so great is the power exercised over Italy by the European Union; hence it is largely unimportant whom they vote for. Perhaps it is the effect of centuries of Catholic paternalism and reckless electoral promises, but nobody seems to envision a practical series of reforms to get from where we are now to where we might want to be; in its place there are prayers and fiscal fantasies.
Mussolini later corrected his comments on illusion. ''It is impossible to ignore reality,'' he said, ''however sad.'' One wonders, as this election approaches, how near Italy is to the moment when denial is no longer possible. I imagine Mr. Berlusconi re-elected and the stock market crashing, the country's international credibility melting away so that he must be removed in a matter of days. But then perhaps Italy's woes will be attributed to the perversities of international finance.
What is never countenanced is the notion that one has made very serious mistakes, or that one might really have to adjust to a reality where economic initiative has shifted decisively to the East, and investment capital with it. Almost every political program in Italy expresses a desire to return to the past, rather than understand the country's place in a changed world.

 BODY:
For almost five years an odd thing happened in 21st-century Chelsea: The 1970s came back. They returned in the form of an artists' community in a ramshackle building along the West Side Highway -- a hulk whose demolition to make way for high-end apartments was forestalled by the recession, among other complications. Known as Cold Castle for its initial lack of heat, its floors slowly filled with artists who were invited in by one of the building's developers. They paid tiny rents and temporarily occupied the kind of huge, raw space most artists haven't had in Manhattan since SoHo was young. 
The fun came to an end late last summer. But now a group of Cold Castle's former denizens are reviving the spirit, as a piece of performance art. They have built a ''diorama'' version of their community inside Family Business, the minuscule Chelsea gallery founded last year by the artist Maurizio Cattelan and the curator Massimiliano Gioni.
Squeezing what was 40,000 square feet of life -- cooking, eating, drinking, hanging out, making art -- into the 120 square feet of Family Business won't be easy, but it should be highly entertaining to watch. (Through March 9, 520 West 21st Street, familybusinessgallery.com.)

HEADLINE: Urban Memories; With John and Yoko

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In her collection ''An Enlarged Heart: A Personal History'' (Knopf, $24.95), Cynthia Zarin delivers a dozen delightful essays set mostly in ephemeral Manhattan.
Ms. Zarin is a poet and children's author, and her first book of adult prose weaves a lyrical memoir out of mundane urban experiences, imbuing each episode with childlike wonder. (Several of the essays were originally published in The New York Times or The Times Magazine.)
Describing herself as ''the most provincial person in the world,'' she writes of a Harlem church that, for her, evoked a church in Prague -- even though she had never visited the Czech city, and even though a friend informed her that ''it looked as little like a church in Prague as it was possible to look.'' 
She invokes a Chinese restaurant on the Upper West Side, presided over by ''a blade-thin man whose high cheekbones are two half-moons in his worried face,'' where her 17-year-old daughter had eaten ''30 times a year since she was 2,'' but that for Ms. Zarin still primarily recalled the old Chock Full o'Nuts that it replaced.
And she recounts her encounters with characters ranging from William Shawn, the New Yorker editor, to Mr. Ferri, an Upper East Side tailor, whom she vividly describes as ''a wren of a man with pins flashing in his teeth.''
''I thought then that it was possible to alter anything,'' she writes.â--
Despite its dry title, ''The Surprising Design of Market Economies'' (University of Texas Press, $25), by Alex Marshall, offers keen insights into urban planning, public works and even the history of New York's onetime ambivalence toward a professional police force. Mr. Marshall is a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning agency for the New York City metropolitan area, and many of his arguments turn on hometown examples.
Mr. Marshall's premise is that ''free markets'' are, in fact, elaborate systems created and shaped by regulation, laws, cultural mores and public infrastructure. His exploration of these systems brings him to his point: Government can do some things better than private enterprise when it has the will.
''If you look at the way society and our nation have progressed,'' he writes, ''a simple rule is that they have progressed by converting private responsibilities to public responsibilities.''â--
The prolific Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine, deserves an award just for recycling. In January, he published ''Dinner With Lenny: The Last Long Interview With Leonard Bernstein.'' Now comes ''Days That I'll Remember'' (Doubleday, $25.95), which he describes as ''the complete versions of all of my significant interviews and conversations with John Lennon and Yoko Ono.''
The book begins in 1963, when Mr. Cott was a Columbia senior and his clock radio woke him to ''I Saw Her Standing There.'' It leaps to his first revealing interview with Mr. Lennon five years later and recounts their personal and professional relationship until 1980. (Mr. Cott conducted his last interview three days before Mr. Lennon was shot outside the Dakota.)
In one conversation, Ms. Ono recalls the loft she rented on Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan in 1960, a $50.50-a-month space appointed with a baby grand piano and furniture fashioned from orange crates.
''All the windows were smoked glass, so that you couldn't really see outside, so it was dark and dingy, but there was the skylight, and when you were in the loft you almost felt more connected to the sky than to the city outside,'' she recalled. ''It was beautiful.''

HEADLINE: Gulf Coast States Jockeying Over Settlement on BP Spill

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
With a major civil trial scheduled to start Monday in New Orleans against BP over damages related to the explosion of an offshore drilling rig in 2010, federal officials and those from the five affected Gulf Coast states are trying to pull together to strike an 11th-hour settlement in the case.
A lawyer briefed on those talks said that the Justice Department and the five states -- Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas -- had reportedly prepared an offer to resolve the two biggest issues central to a series of trials against BP, the first of which starts Monday. 
One of those issues is the fines that the company would pay for violations of the Clean Water Act related to the four million gallons of oil spilled after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig, which BP had leased from Transocean. The other point of dispute is how much the company will have to pay in penalties under a different environmental statute for damage caused by the oil to the area: beaches, marshes, wildlife and fisheries.
The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that federal and state officials were preparing a $16 billion settlement offer that would cover both the Clean Water Act fines and environmental penalties related to the spill. ''The ball is on BP's side of the table,'' said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
Justice Department officials and state officials could not be reached Saturday to comment on any possible offer. A spokesman for BP, Geoff Morrell, said, ''BP doesn't talk about possible offers or negotiations, but I can tell you we are ready for trial and looking forward to the opportunity to present our case starting Monday.''
The lawyer briefed on the talks said that one problem with the current proposal was that it did not cover economic damages claimed by the states related to the spill. Such claims could still leave BP on the hook for billions more, in addition to the environmental damages.
The late negotiations among federal and state officials to find common ground represents progress, even if limited, in the search for a settlement. The five states have had sharp disagreements over how much BP should pay and how billions of dollars in potential settlement funds should be divided.
For example, only Louisiana and Alabama, are participating in the trial starting on Monday, though Florida, Mississippi and Texas could be part of any settlement. Officials in Louisiana believe their state deserves the bulk of any settlement since its coastal waters, fisheries and businesses suffered the most. Florida and other states that escaped serious coastal damage instead want money for economic losses that they sustained.
''There are a lot of moving parts,'' said Luther Strange, the attorney general of Alabama. ''Personalities aside, the issues are so complex.'' Another lawyer briefed on the talks said he believed any proposal involving Louisiana would be significant because its participation would be critical to any settlement.
Also, billions of dollars could be assessed against BP in several ways, either through fines, or through penalties to redress environmental damage and payments to cover economic losses. And each of those methods represents a different set of stakes and consequences for each of the states and for BP.
For instance, BP would prefer to limit the fines and make more payments through environmental damage penalties, because those penalties can be written off as tax deductions while fines cannot. But the states have more flexibility in spending money derived from fines.
To date, BP has agreed to pay an estimated $30 billion in fines, settlement payments and cleanup costs related to the Deepwater Horizon explosion, which killed 11 workers aboard the rig. And so far, company officials have said they have no intention of acceding to demands from the states for huge economic damages.
Still, the stakes for BP in the trial are high. If the company is found in this first phase of the trial to have acted with gross negligence, it could face up to $17.5 billion in penalties, much of that in fines that would hit the bottom line hardest because they do not qualify as tax deductions.
The lack of a unified strategy to date among the states has also posed another problem for BP; companies are less likely to settle a major lawsuit if they know yet another one is waiting.
''There is no question that a settlement has been made more challenging because the states have competing interests,'' said David M. Uhlmann, a law professor at the University of Michigan and former head of the Justice Department's environmental crimes division.
Efforts to resolve the case through settlement were also inadvertently complicated by Congress when it passed a law in 2011 known as the Restore Act.
Essentially, the law was an effort by Congressional lawmakers from the Gulf Coast states to make sure the bulk of fines and penalties paid by BP for violations of federal pollution laws ended up with the states instead of the federal government.
Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said that she and other lawmakers from the region were involved in intense negotiations giving each state the freedom to use much of the funds how it wanted, whether for environmental or economic purposes.
The law ''was an attempt to distribute the money fairly,'' Ms. Landrieu said in an interview.
But the statute worsened what were already growing tensions among the states over how they could use any funds from BP, between environmental damage and economic losses. ''Up until last year, all the states were rowing together,'' said one lawyer who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The split among the Gulf Coast states surfaced again in November when the Justice Department announced the $4.5 billion settlement of criminal charges against BP. At the time, federal and state officials were also seeking to resolve the civil damage claims.
But those talks failed largely because of disagreements between Louisiana and other states on issues like the size of the settlement that BP was offering, said people briefed on the talks.
Mississippi officials are apparently seeking to bring a separate action against BP in state court, a forum that can be favorable to plaintiffs. Jan Schaefer, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Jim Hood of Mississippi, said he declined to comment.
Mr. Uhlmann of the University of Michigan said the BP case could be resolved, but at this moment it might be more up to the states than the company.
''A settlement is still possible, but not if the states demand more in a settlement than BP is likely to pay even if it loses on every single issue at trial,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Neither Moms Nor Imbeciles

BYLINE: By HANNAH SELIGSON

 BODY:
THE hapless, bumbling father is a stock character in product marketing. He makes breakfast for dinner and is incapable of handling, or sometimes even noticing, a soggy diaper. He tries desperately to hide the crumb-strewn, dirt-streaked evidence of his poor parenting before the mother gets home.
This is an image that many fathers who attended the Dad 2.0 Summit -- a meeting of so-called daddy bloggers and the marketers who want to reach them -- have come to revile. They are proud to be involved in domestic life and do not want to serve as the comic foil to the supercompetent mother.
In the past, consumer-product marketers weren't all that concerned with what fathers thought -- women, after all, make the majority of purchasing decisions for households. But men are catching up: In 2012 men spent an average of $36.26 at the grocery store per trip, compared with $27.49 in 2004, according to data from Nielsen. Companies see an opportunity to reach a new demographic. 
The bloggers, for their part, are using their influence to change the way marketers portray them. ''The payoff is huge if you get dads right,'' says Jim Lin, vice president and digital strategist at Ketchum Public Relations in San Francisco, a blogger at The Busy Dad Blog and a father of two.
To put it another way, while the mom space is crowded with players, the dad space has room for more. So there is big money to be made, both by companies looking at fathers as consumers and by daddy bloggers looking to ride a wave of brand sponsorship just as mommy bloggers have.
THE 200 or so bloggers and media professionals who attended the second annual Dad 2.0 conference in Houston from Jan. 31 to Feb. 2 were mainly in their 30s and 40s. They tended to wear well-fitting jeans, button-down shirts and blazers, and they were quick to whip out pictures of their children on their iPhones.
The 44 brand representatives at the conference tried to project a hip blend of parenthood and masculinity. At one point, Dove Men+Care, a Unilever line of deodorants, soap, shampoo and other products, set up a traditional barbershop at the Four Seasons Hotel, where the conference was held. The same space became a whiskey bar one night, complete with bracing free samples. Dove, which paid six figures to serve as the conference's main sponsor, also offered daily sword-fighting lessons with Steven McMichael, who trained the actors in ''The Hobbit.''
Another sponsor was Honda, which offered test-drives of some of its 2013 models, including, of course, a minivan. Kraft was there, with taste tests of cheese-laden meals. ConAgra Foods, which makes things as diverse as Swiss Miss and Hebrew National hot dogs, played to more traditional notions of what men enjoy by featuring cheerleaders in short skirts at its booth. On the other hand, it also sponsored an event called the Great Dad Cook-Off.
Representatives of Maclaren, the stroller maker, did not have a booth, but they came to the conference this year to do reconnaissance. ''Maclaren is eyeing the dad market,'' says Shanin Molinaro, the company's global vice president for marketing. The company, she says, has taken note of evolving parental roles, including a rising number of stay-at-home fathers and fathers in same-sex marriages. Just this year, Maclaren came out with a new stroller, the BMW Buggy.
Dad 2.0 is owned by XY Media, a start-up company based in Houston that advises brands on how to appeal to fathers. The conference's founders are Doug French, 47, who has two sons, 10 and 7; and John Pacini, 40, who has a son, 11, and a daughter, 7. They saw an opening in the market after they packed sessions on fatherhood-related topics at the Mom 2.0 Summit in New Orleans in 2011. That conference was founded, conveniently, by Mr. Pacini's wife, Carrie Pacini.
One of the biggest laments among bloggers at this year's Dad 2.0 Summit was that many marketers continued to portray fathers as babbling buffoons who need constant supervision. ''Dads are seen as heroes as long as their kids don't drown in the swimming pool,'' says Mr. French, who has a blog called Laid-Off Dad.
Last year, the daddy blogosphere erupted when Huggies released a commercial that showed a group of fathers and their babies, with a voice-over that said, ''To prove Huggies diapers and wipes can handle anything, we put them to the toughest test imaginable: Dads, alone with their babies, in one house, for five days.''
The daddy bloggers were led by Chris Routly, 37, a stay-at-home father in Portland, Ore., who blogs at The Daddy Doctrines. He started a petition calling on Huggies, which is owned by the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, to pull the ad.
''The verbiage was implying that dads need the help of a special product to overcome our incompetence,'' says Mr. Routly, whose sons are 4 and 2.
The petition on Change.org drew 1,300 signatures, but Mr. Routly closed it after a Huggies representative called him to solicit advice about making the company's marketing more acceptable to fathers.
Huggies replaced the commercial with a spot that had already been shot, with a different voice-over: ''To prove Huggies diapers can handle anything, we asked real dads to put them to the test -- with their own babies, at naptime, after a very full feeding.'' The subtle difference in wording implied that fathers were discerning diaper experts, rather than neglectful idiots.
Kevin Brown, who oversees commercial programming for the Huggies brand in Neenah, Wis., attended the Dad 2.0 Summit and said his company learned something. ''Dads do not want to be treated differently, and they do not want to be treated foolishly,'' he said. ''We are better marketers because of what happened last year.''
MORE marketers are paying attention to fathers because more fathers are deciding what to buy for their families. That comes as no surprise to Mr. Routly. ''Before I left for Dad 2.0, I had to make sure my wife knew the way to the grocery store,'' he says.
To capture that growing market, brands face a challenge: How do they appeal to fathers' competence without making them look like mothers?
Some daddy bloggers grumbled over a 2011 ad for Procter & Gamble's Tide detergent that showed a stay-at-home father folding laundry and referred to him as a ''dad-mom.'' The National At-Home Dad Network, a nonprofit group that had a booth at the summit, puts it this way in its literature: ''Dads do not parent like Mom, nor are a replacement for her when she's not home.''
Matthew Willcox, executive director of the Institute of Decision Making at the advertising agency Draftfcb in San Francisco, studies how neuroscience and behavioral economics relate to marketing. He suggests that companies and advertisers need to be very aware of the societal shift around parenting. ''It's not a question of applying the same rules that apply to moms,'' he says.
Mr. Willcox, who did not attend Dad 2.0, cited a 2010 Toyota ad by Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles for the Sienna SE minivan as one that was particularly effective at reaching the new father demographic. The two-and-a-half-minute online spot featured a normal-looking couple rapping about parenting while nuzzling their Sienna SE, styled the ''Swagger Wagon.'' The video, which briefly appeared on television, has attracted more than 11 million views on YouTube since May 2010.
''The whole notion of having a minivan can be quite degrading -- you talk to parents about having to swap out their car for a very practical minivan, and it can be devastating,'' says Mr. Willcox, whose company did not work on the campaign. ''But what Toyota and the Swagger Wagon did was make having a minivan part of a positive identity for fathers.''
In the Swagger Wagon ad, the father (played by Brian Huskey) is balding but wears thick, black, hipster-type glasses. ''The dad in the video is not a cringingly cool dad,'' Mr. Willcox says, but ''appropriately cool.''
THE relationship between the bloggers and marketers cuts both ways. The marketers are selling to the bloggers, but the bloggers also have something to gain from the marketers, like sponsorships and branding.
Charlie Capen, 31, who blogs at How to Be a Dad, asked Honda, a sponsor of Dad 2.0, to back a project with his blog's co-founder, Andy Herald, and David Vienna of the site The Daddy Complex. He thought it would be fun to chronicle the men's 32-hour drive from Los Angeles to the conference in Houston. Honda provided the vehicle, a 2013 Crosstour, and covered video production costs. It will also pay for space to show the video on Mr. Capen's blog, and for him to promote the video on social media sites, something known as sponsored content.
''The idea is us in the car having a frank and funny conversation about ourselves as fathers,'' says Mr. Capen, who is also the director of online engagement at 20th Century Fox. ''They are sponsoring us to talk about fatherhood in a way that is funny and consumable.'' Neither he nor Honda disclosed further financial details, such as how much the bloggers were paid for the video, which has not yet been posted.
Mr. Capen, who has a 3-year-old son, says his site receives 200,000 to 300,000 unique viewers a month. He has worked with Clorox and the automaker Kia on similar projects. The collaboration with Clorox resulted in a post last December titled ''The 3 P's of Parenting,'' referring, the site noted, to ''pee, poop and puke.'' Clorox tried to entice readers to click through and win $15,000 by sharing their messy moment in a 120-character story.
As mommy bloggers and their readers can attest, sponsorships carry risks. The Federal Trade Commission can fine the blogger and the sponsoring company for not revealing the relationship. And bloggers perceived as simply shilling for companies without regard for quality will lose respect.
But for fathers, just getting the attention of consumer-products companies has been a long time coming.
IT has been a struggle to get fathers included in family-oriented ads at all. Just look at the campaign that Procter & Gamble ran last year during the Summer Olympics, called ''Thank You, Mom,'' which saluted mothers for helping to nurture Olympic athletes. Surely some fathers were involved, daddy bloggers argued.
Advertisers and brands have been slow to respond to fathers as a consumer group because of a dearth of data, says Alan Kercinik, a Chicago-based group creative director at Edelman, the public relations firm.
''There is considerably more time, attention and money spent understanding how 'she' buys versus how 'families' buy -- and certainly more than 'he' buys,'' Mr. Kercinik says.
''We are just at the hello stage on this journey to reach dads,'' says Barry Calpino, vice president for breakthrough innovation at the Kraft Foods Group. ''Ninety-nine percent of the conversation is 'she,' '' he says. ''I haven't been to a food retailer who didn't refer to the shopper as 'she,' so I don't think we are even thinking about metrics at this point.''
That is changing, albeit slowly. Recently, Dove Men+Care commissioned research, in conjunction with the Center for Work and Family at Boston College, about the roles fathers play at work, at home and in their leisure time.
''Any subject related to dads, we want to know about,'' says Rob Candelino, vice president for marketing at Unilever, who focuses on the Dove Men +Care product line.
This is not a social mission; it is about the bottom line. Dove Men+Care, introduced in 2010, is already a $100 million brand, and about 75 percent of its customers are fathers, according to Mr. Candelino, who is a father himself. ''Men are more receptive to messages about taking care of themselves after they have children,'' he says.
In the past, advertisers paid more attention to men in the so-called laddie demographic, ages 18 to 30, who are more likely to spend their disposable income on alcohol and cars. But there is a whole group of men between the beer-guzzling, Maxim-reading phase and the Viagra years.
Mr. Candelino described his target customer as a father, or an expectant one, who is in his late 30s and married, cares deeply about his role as a father and mentor, and is as comfortable having a tea party with his daughter as he is having beers with his friends.
''No brands were talking to guys at that level,'' he says. ''Society is ready for a new narrative about dads.''

HEADLINE: A World Without Work

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
IMAGINE, as 19th-century utopians often did, a society rich enough that fewer and fewer people need to work -- a society where leisure becomes universally accessible, where part-time jobs replace the regimented workweek, and where living standards keep rising even though more people have left the work force altogether.
If such a utopia were possible, one might expect that it would be achieved first among the upper classes, and then gradually spread down the social ladder. First the wealthy would work shorter hours, then the middle class, and finally even high school dropouts would be able to sleep late and take four-day weekends and choose their own adventures -- ''to hunt in the morning,'' as Karl Marx once prophesied, ''fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner ...'' 
Yet the decline of work isn't actually some wild Marxist scenario. It's a basic reality of 21st-century American life, one that predates the financial crash and promises to continue apace even as normal economic growth returns. This decline isn't unemployment in the usual sense, where people look for work and can't find it. It's a kind of post-employment, in which people drop out of the work force and find ways to live, more or less permanently, without a steady job. So instead of spreading from the top down, leisure time -- wanted or unwanted -- is expanding from the bottom up. Long hours are increasingly the province of the rich.
Of course, nobody is hailing this trend as the sign of civilizational progress. Instead, the decline in blue-collar work is often portrayed in near-apocalyptic terms -- on the left as the economy's failure to supply good-paying jobs, and on the right as a depressing sign that government dependency is killing the American work ethic.
But it's worth linking today's trends to the older dream of a post-work utopia, because there are ways in which the decline in work-force participation is actually being made possible by material progress.
That progress can be hard to appreciate at the moment, but America's immense wealth is still our era's most important economic fact. ''When a nation is as rich as ours,'' Scott Winship points out in an essay for Breakthrough Journal, ''it can realize larger absolute gains than it did in the past ... even if it has lower growth rates.'' Our economy may look stagnant compared to the acceleration after World War II, but even disappointing growth rates are likely to leave the America of 2050 much richer than today.
Those riches mean that we can probably find ways to subsidize -- through public means and private -- a continuing decline in blue-collar work. Many of the Americans dropping out of the work force are not destitute: they're receiving disability payments and food stamps, living with relatives, cobbling together work here and there, and often doing as well as they might with a low-wage job. By historical standards their lives are more comfortable than the left often allows, and the fiscal cost of their situation is more sustainable than the right tends to admits. (Medicare may bankrupt us, but food stamps probably will not.)
There is a certain air of irresponsibility to giving up on employment altogether, of course. But while pundits who tap on keyboards for a living like to extol the inherent dignity of labor, we aren't the ones stocking shelves at Walmart or hunting wearily, week after week, for a job that probably pays less than our last one did. One could make the case that the right to not have a boss is actually the hardest won of modern freedoms: should it really trouble us if more people in a rich society end up exercising it?
The answer is yes -- but mostly because the decline of work carries social costs as well as an economic price tag. Even a grinding job tends to be an important source of social capital, providing everyday structure for people who live alone, a place to meet friends and kindle romances for people who lack other forms of community, a path away from crime and prison for young men, an example to children and a source of self-respect for parents.
Here the decline in work-force participation is of a piece with the broader turn away from community in America -- from family breakdown and declining churchgoing to the retreat into the virtual forms of sport and sex and friendship. Like many of these trends, it poses a much greater threat to social mobility than to absolute prosperity. (A nonworking working class may not be immiserated; neither will its members ever find a way to rise above their station.) And its costs will be felt in people's private lives and inner worlds even when they don't show up in the nation's G.D.P.
In a sense, the old utopians were prescient: we've gained a world where steady work is less necessary to human survival than ever before.
But human flourishing is another matter. And it's our fulfillment, rather than the satisfaction of our appetites, that's threatened by the slow decline of work.

HEADLINE: Pompom Girl For Feminism

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
SHERYL SANDBERG is not one to settle for being the It Girl of Silicon Valley.
Nor is the chief operating officer of Facebook willing to write a book that people might merely read.
One of her friends from her Harvard days told Vogue that the brainy, beautiful, charming, stylish, happily married 43-year-old mother of two, one of the world's richest self-made women, has an ''infectious insistence.'' (She would have to, having founded Harvard's aerobics program in the '80s, wearing blue eye shadow and leg warmers.)
Now that she has domesticated the Facebook frat house, Sandberg wants to be ''the pompom girl for feminism,'' as she calls it. She has a grandiose plan to become the PowerPoint Pied Piper in Prada ankle boots reigniting the women's revolution -- Betty Friedan for the digital age. She wants women to stop limiting and sabotaging themselves. 
The petite corporate star is larger than life, and a normal book tour for ''Lean In,'' which she describes as ''sort of a feminist manifesto'' mixed with career advice, just won't do.
''I always thought I would run a social movement,'' she said in ''Makers,'' an AOL/PBS documentary on feminist history.
Sandberg may have caught the fever to change the world from Mark Zuckerberg, or come by it genetically. She writes that her mother, at age 11, responded to a rabbi's sermon on tikkun olam, the Jewish concept of repairing the world, by ''grabbing a tin can and knocking on doors to support civil rights workers in the South.''
The charmed Sandberg is no Queen Bee. Unlike some other women who reach the top, she does not pull up the ladder, or jungle gym, as she prefers to think of it, behind her. Many women found it inspiring when she said in ''Makers'' that she left work at 5:30 to go home to her kids, even while they acknowledged that you might have to be Sheryl Sandberg to get away with that.
Sandberg, who worked at the Treasury Department for her mentor, Larry Summers, and at Google before going to Facebook, started a group called the Women of Silicon Valley to listen to celebrity speakers and swap stories.
She knows there is slow evolution or even erosion in women's progress in some areas, and that many younger women don't want to be called feminists. Professional women often take their husbands' last names these days without a thought.
Her book is chockablock with good tips and insights, if a bit discouraging at times. She urges women in salary negotiations to smile frequently and use the word ''we'' instead of ''I.'' And she encourages employers and women to talk upfront about plans for children, which employers may fear is lawsuit fodder.
She seems to think she can remedy social paradigms with a new kind of club -- a combo gabfest, Oprah session and corporate pep talk. (Where's the yoga?)
Sandberg has been recruiting corporations to join her Lean In Foundation, which will create the Lean In Community and Lean In Circles, which are, as The Times's Jodi Kantor wrote, like ''consciousness-raising groups of yore.'' The circles will entail 8 to 12 peers who will meet monthly and use ''education modules'' to learn the skills to pursue equality. (Like how Rosa Parks used bus modules.) The debut assignment is a video on how to command more authority by altering how you speak and sit.
Women are encouraged to send in stories about leaning in, but no sad sacks allowed: ''Share a positive ending about what you learned from the experience,'' says the instructional material for Lean In Circles. And no truants: ''Don't invite flakes.''
That leaves me leaning out.
Sandberg has already gotten some flak from women who think that her attitude is too elitist and that she is too prone to blame women for failing to get ahead. (Not everyone has Larry Page and Sergey Brin volunteering to baby-sit, and Zuckerberg offering a shoulder to cry on.) Noting that her Facebook page for ''Lean In'' looks more like an ego wall with ''deep thoughts,'' critics argue that her unique perch as a mogul with the world's best husband to boot makes her tone-deaf to the problems average women face as they struggle to make ends meet in a rough economy, while taking care of kids, aging parents and housework.
Sandberg describes taking her kids to a business conference last year and realizing en route that her daughter had head lice. But the good news was that she was on the private eBay jet.
Sandberg may mean well, and she may be setting up a run for national office. But she doesn't understand the difference between a social movement and a social network marketing campaign. Just because digital technology makes connecting possible doesn't mean you're actually reaching people.
People come to a social movement from the bottom up, not the top down. Sandberg has co-opted the vocabulary and romance of a social movement not to sell a cause, but herself.
She says she's using marketing for the purpose of social idealism. But she's actually using social idealism for the purpose of marketing.

HEADLINE: A Tent City For Fun And Profit

BYLINE: By BILL MORRIS

 BODY:
DURHAM, N.C. -- Duke is an elite private university where the buildings are pretend Gothic, where tuition is $42,000 a year, and where hundreds of students eagerly and voluntarily spent five wintry weeks camping in the famed tent city known as Krzyzewskiville for one simple reason: to get a good seat for the basketball game against archrival North Carolina.
But even at Duke, where crazy is cool and basketball is king, some administrators, faculty and students are asking if big-time sports -- and some of the behavior that goes with it -- is a big waste of time and energy.
''For a big state school, there's some justification for big-time sports; for a private institution like Duke, it's a little harder to figure out,'' said Charles T. Clotfelter, a professor of public policy, economics and law at Duke who has written a book called ''Big-Time Sports in American Universities.'' 
''Why are we here?'' Clotfelter added. ''We're here to educate people. There has been a lot of new chatter about this in the past three years. I think it's better for us to come clean and say, yes, we do commercial sports.''
That kind of talk is not confined to Duke, or to other elite, private universities. It is taking place at college campuses of all sizes around the country. Duke, however, is a university accustomed to having it all -- high academic standards, a vibrant social life and big-time sports -- and that was enough to take a trip to see what the debate on campus was like.
In 2010, the Knight Commission, an N.C.A.A. watchdog group made up of university presidents and other leaders, reported that spending on high-profile sports was growing at up to triple the pace of spending on academics.
''We've reached the point where big-time intercollegiate athletics is undermining the integrity of our institutions, diverting presidents and institutions from their main purpose,'' William E. Kirwan, the chancellor of the University of Maryland system and a co-director of the commission, said last year.
Clotfelter pointed out that the current debate about the damaging fallout from big-time college sports echoes an argument that dates to the 1920s. ''The only thing that's different now is the money,'' he said.
And at Duke, the money generated by the basketball team is way past crazy. In his book, Clotfelter set out to document the nationwide academic cost of athletic success. Among his findings: at colleges with teams in the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament, library patrons view 6 percent fewer articles a day as long as the team is in the tournament; on the day immediately after a team wins in an upset or a close game, library use plunges by 19 percent. Clotfelter also found that from 1985 to 2010, average salaries at public universities rose by 32 percent for full professors, 90 percent for presidents and 650 percent for football coaches.
Just how crazy is the basketball money at Duke? To find out, I visited a six-story ziggurat called the Schwartz-Butters Athletics Center. It towers over Cameron Indoor Stadium and a new $18.5 million structure known as the Michael W. Krzyzewski Center for Academic and Athletic Excellence, where the men's and women's basketball players practice and lift weights, and where all of the university's 620 athletes in 26 sports can come to work on their studies.
On the top floor, I was ushered into the office of Mike Cragg, the senior associate director of athletics, who is in charge of what is called the Legacy Fund, which has raised $65 million since 2000 to finance the men's basketball program -- scholarships, salaries, the operating budget and capital projects. I asked Cragg who came up with the idea.
''Coach K had a vision,'' Cragg said. ''We realized we had an opportunity to monetize the commitment to the basketball program, and we could expand our donor base outside alumni.''
The most generous donor has kicked in $7.5 million, and the minimum donation is $1 million. With a thought to some of the ideas Clotfelter has studied, I said, ''Have you ever considered getting rid of K-Ville?''
Cragg looked at me like I might require medical attention. ''It's nothing we would want to get rid of,'' he said. ''It's part of the university fabric. It brings an energy to the program because our staff and players know we're all in this together with the students. That translates onto the court.''
Indeed, Duke's fans, known as the Cameron Crazies, are as synonymous with the team as Krzyzewski. They are passionate, inventive and, depending on your viewpoint, uproariously funny or brutally annoying. Krzyzewski -- winner of 946 college games, 4 national championships and 2 Olympic gold medals -- has called them Duke's ''sixth man.''
When it comes to the tent village, students say that the experience is a vital part of their Duke education. No one pretends much studying is done, but they say it helps them with team building, time management and organizational skills. (There are various self-imposed rules that must be followed in the village.)
Many opponents of the practice realize it is here to stay. ''By now, tenting has become part of the Duke brand and undergraduate experience,'' said Orin Starn, who teaches the anthropology of sports at Duke and has spoken out against the ''strain of anti-intellectualism'' that comes with big-time college sports. ''None of us on the faculty or in the Duke administration would dare to suggest that student time might be better invested elsewhere.''
In ''Buck Duke's University,'' a withering satire that appeared in H. L. Mencken's American Mercury magazine in 1933, W. J. Cash derided the tobacco baron James Buchanan Duke's school as a ''Babbitt factory -- a mill for grinding out go-get-'em boys in the wholesale and undeviating fashion in which his Chesterfield plant across the way ground out cigarettes.''
That is a far cry from what Duke is today. It is a diverse institution that attracts qualified and motivated students from nearly every state and some 90 foreign countries. Consistently ranked among the top 10 universities in the country, Duke has a strong reputation for teaching and research, as well as renowned graduate schools of business, public policy, engineering, medicine and law. Amid all the diversity and academic excellence, there is also a concerted effort to curtail some of the less-than-intellectual practices linked to sporting events, including tailgating parties, heavy drinking and other assorted shenanigans.
The face of this moderation effort is Larry Moneta, the vice president for student affairs. Moneta discontinued Tailgate, an alcohol-saturated costume party that used to precede football games. (The last straw was when a 14-year-old boy was found passed-out drunk in a portable toilet.) Moneta also supported a policy that requires most on-campus parties to have a monitor who looks for signs of excessive drinking. When people started pitching tents in K-Ville as early as December, Moneta put a stop to it, decreeing that tenting could not start until after winter break.
''The extremes have been cut back dramatically -- out-of-control parties, the number of alcohol-related hospitalizations,'' Moneta said. ''I think we've done a good job of working with students to find reasonable solutions. Our goal has been to take extremes out of the equation. I want them to have a good time and wake up alive the next morning.''
There have even been timid steps to let some of the air out of Duke basketball. Richard H. Brodhead, a former English professor and dean at Yale who was named Duke's president in 2004, recently said he found it ''foolish'' and ''disheartening'' when high school students listed the men's basketball team as the primary reason they applied to Duke. The comment set off a typhoon of response -- some of it positive, most of it negative -- among students and alumni.
Brodhead probably was not surprised. On his first day on the job, he got the distressing news that Krzyzewski was being wooed by the Los Angeles Lakers of the N.B.A., who were said to be offering $40 million.
Brodhead found himself in an unfamiliar bind. He had spent his entire career in the Ivy League, where there are no athletic scholarships, and now he was getting a crash course on the importance of sports at Duke. Specifically, he was learning that the most powerful person on campus is the men's basketball coach. Realizing that losing Krzyzewski would not be the ideal way to start his tenure, the scholarly Brodhead swallowed hard and joined a crowd of students chanting, ''Coach K, please stay!'' Brodhead was also part of a human chain forming the letter ''K'' outside Cameron.
Starn, the professor of the anthropology of sports, said at the time, ''What you saw there was the lay of the land.''
Sitting among the Cameron Crazies during a Duke game is a lot of fun. The team is thrilling to watch, and the fans are, well, crazy. The experience is like being trapped in a mosh pit inside a jet engine during a hurricane.
But if you can get beyond the clichés -- the costumes, the body paint, the pep band, the noise -- you realize you are in a rarefied world of oak paneling, gleaming brass rails and polished floors, where things happen with military precision, echoing Krzyzewski's West Point background.
Cameron, you realize, is not just a basketball arena. It is a tabernacle, a place whose trappings, rituals and exclusivity are perfect to prepare Duke students for the places they are likely to wind up after graduation: big banks and law firms, corporate board rooms and country club locker rooms. No, Cameron is not only a basketball arena. It is a flawless expression of the thing that beats in the heart of Duke and every other elite school in the land: privilege. And privilege comes with prerogatives for students, including the freedom to do things that seem to have nothing to do with getting an education. Things that are, quite simply, nuts.

HEADLINE: Emory University's Leader Reopens Its Racial Wounds

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON and ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- A reception on Friday at Emory University to celebrate the work of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in the years after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. could have been more poorly timed, but not by much.
All week long, the president of Emory, James W. Wagner, had been trying to control the damage done by a column he wrote for the university magazine. In it, he praised the 1787 three-fifths compromise, which allowed each slave to be counted as three-fifths of a person in determining how much Congressional power the Southern states would have, as an example of how polarized people could find common ground.
It was, he has since said, a clumsy and regrettable mistake.
A faculty group censured him last week for the remarks. And in a speech at Friday's reception for the campus exhibition, ''And the Struggle Continues: The Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Fight for Social Change,'' Dr. Wagner acknowledged both the nation's continuing education in race relations and his own. 
''I know that I personally have a long way to go,'' he said.
His article has been seized upon by students and faculty members who say it was yet one more example of insensitivity from the Emory administration, which in September announced sweeping cuts that some say unfairly targeted programs that are popular with minorities.
About 45 students showed up to protest at the reception, silently holding signs that read ''This is 5/5 outrageous'' and ''Shame on James'' as the fight for racial equality was discussed by Dr. Wagner; Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a veteran of the civil rights movement; and leaders of the S.C.L.C.
Whether the cuts -- which include phasing out the departments of physical education and visual arts and also the journalism program, and suspending admission to graduate programs in economics and Spanish -- disproportionately affect racial minorities is in dispute at the university, where minority members make up 31 percent of the student body.
Certain programs that focused on or made recruiting minority members a priority have been shifted to other departments or eliminated, but university officials say the impact will not be as drastic as protesters believe.
Savings will be reinvested in other departments, including neurosciences, studies of contemporary China and new media studies.
Such academic realignment is starting to happen at liberal arts colleges around the country, said Phil Kleweno, a consultant at Bain & Company who specializes in higher education.
''Not every school can excel in every subject,'' he said. ''Given where we are financially, these are wise decisions for many universities to make.''
In an interview on Friday, Dr. Wagner said neither the cuts nor his self-described gaffe in Emory Magazine was intended to hurt what he described as a vibrant multicultural environment at the college.
The president's misstep was only the latest episode in what one Emory administrator called ''quite a challenging year'' for the private university.
Although still listed as the 20th best university in the nation in U.S. News and World Report's latest ranking, Emory admitted in August that it had intentionally sent incorrect test scores to the magazine and the Department of Education for more than a decade.
The university has also grappled over whether to allow Chick-fil-A, whose conservative Christian owners have donated large amounts of money to organizations opposed to same-sex marriage, to operate on campus.
And in October, Dr. Wagner officially apologized to Jewish dental students who had been failed, harassed or both under John E. Buhler's tenure as dean of the dental school from 1948 to 1961.
Many saw the apology for that chapter in Emory's history, when as many as 65 percent of Jewish students had to redo course work or were failed, as a healing move in keeping with the culture of the university, which has devoted years to studying its own racial history, both good and bad.
The school, which is 177 years old, was named for John Emory, a Methodist bishop who owned slaves. Although many of its leaders favored segregated education, the school decided in 1962 to sue the state for the right to enroll students regardless of race.
More recently, the school dealt with a fraternity that flew a Confederate flag and an anthropology professor who used a racial epithet in class. But it also houses significant collections of African-American historical artifacts and literature, including what is thought to be the nation's most complete database documenting American slave trade routes.
''Emory is a community that airs its laundry,'' Dr. Wagner said in the interview, calling that a strength and a demonstration of its ability to evolve with its student body.
''We've had several wounds this year,'' he said. ''This one,'' he added, referring to the magazine column, ''is a particularly painful wound for me because it was self-inflicted.''
Jovonna Jones, 19, the president of the Black Student Alliance at Emory, said she had forgiven Dr. Wagner for his transgression.
''As an African-American woman who has gone to predominately white institutions since middle school, I've had lots of incidents like this,'' she said. ''It's hard to be shocked anymore.''
People keep asking her if she thinks the university president is a racist, Ms. Jones said.
''I don't think that's the real question,'' she said. ''The important question is: What does it mean to embrace and value a diverse student body? What are the values of the school?''
Leslie Harris, a history professor and the director of a series of campus events that for five years examined issues of race at Emory, said she was more troubled by the intellectual holes in Dr. Wagner's argument.
In his column, Dr. Wagner used the Congressional fight over the national debt to muse on the importance of compromise, which he called a tool for noble achievement. ''The constitutional compromise about slavery, for instance, facilitated the achievement of what both sides of the debate really aspired to -- a new nation,'' he wrote.
That is a deep misunderstanding of history, Dr. Harris said.
''The three-fifths compromise is one of the greatest failed compromises in U.S. history,'' she said. ''Its goal was to keep the union together, but the Civil War broke out anyway.''
To members of the S.C.L.C., whose records are housed at Emory's Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library, the protesters at the reception were a welcome sign.
''I love it,'' said Brenda Davenport, who has served as the national volunteer and youth organizer for the S.C.L.C. ''Where else would you want protesters to show up but at something that is about the value of protesting?''

HEADLINE: Fault-Finding Grows Intense As Cuts Near

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- First the White House and Congress created a potential fiscal crisis, agreeing more than a year ago to once-unthinkable governmentwide spending cuts in 2013 unless the two parties agreed to alternative ways to reduce budget deficits.
Now that those cuts are imminent -- because compromise is not -- they have created one of Washington's odder blame games over just whose bad idea this was.
The battle lines over cuts that are scheduled to begin on Friday, known in budget parlance as sequestration, were evident on Saturday in President Obama's weekly address and the Republican response, by Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota.
''Unfortunately, it appears that Republicans in Congress have decided that instead of compromising, instead of asking anything of the wealthiest Americans, they would rather let these cuts fall squarely on the middle class,'' said Mr. Obama, who proposed a substitute mix of spending cuts and revenues from repealing some tax breaks for wealthy people and corporations. 
He added: ''Are Republicans in Congress really willing to let these cuts fall on our kids' schools and mental health care just to protect tax loopholes for corporate jet owners? Are they really willing to slash military health care and the Border Patrol just because they refuse to eliminate tax breaks for big oil companies?''
For Republicans, who oppose any tax increases, Mr. Hoeven countered: ''He blames Congress for the sequester, but Bob Woodward, in his book 'The Price of Politics' sets the record straight. Woodward says it was President Obama who proposed -- and promoted -- the sequester.''
What makes this debate over blame so odd is that both sides' fingerprints -- and votes -- are all over the sequestration concept. The point of sequestration, in fact, was to define cuts that were so arbitrary and widespread that they would be unpalatable to both sides and force a deal.
That won Republicans' support for increasing the government's debt limit in 2011, and averted the nation's first default. The Republican-led House and Democratic-led Senate each passed the accord overwhelmingly, and Mr. Obama gladly signed it.
The idea for sequestration did come from the White House, as news accounts made clear at the time. Jacob J. Lew, then Mr. Obama's budget director and now his nominee for Treasury secretary, was the main proponent.
Mr. Lew, who was a senior adviser to the House speaker in the 1980s, lifted language from a 1985 law he helped negotiate, the Gramm-Rudman law. It was conceived by two Republican senators to be ''a sword of Damocles,'' poised to strike both parties unless they compromised on deficit reduction.
The law was ruled unconstitutional, and afterward, the Democratic-controlled Congress and President Ronald Reagan enacted a modified version, which resulted in relatively minor cuts until 1990. That year, the law's call for much larger cuts in the face of growing deficits helped force Congress and President George Bush to negotiate spending cuts and tax increases widely credited with contributing to balanced budgets later that decade.
Fast-forward to the summer of 2011. Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans, once again facing deficits, were able to agree to nearly $1 trillion in reductions over a decade in ''discretionary'' spending programs, which cover just about everything the government does except the entitlement benefit programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
But they could not agree on the final $1.2 trillion. The president demanded that that amount come from higher taxes on the wealthy and some reductions in entitlement spending. Republicans insisted on entitlement cuts only.
So both parties started negotiating for a trigger, as they called it -- an undesirable, automatic action that would slash deficits if Democrats and Republicans could not. Mr. Obama and Democrats wanted a trigger mandating automatic spending cuts and tax increases; Republicans insisted on spending cuts only.
Democrats conceded, and that is when Mr. Lew -- along with Gene Sperling, director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council -- proposed the Gramm-Rudman sequestration. Given that law's Republican parentage, the Obama advisers figured this kind of trigger would appeal to Republicans, and it did.
Speaker John A. Boehner and three-quarters of House Republicans voted for the agreement. To use Mr. Hoeven's word, both parties ''promoted'' their compromise, including sequestration. Mr. Boehner said he had gotten ''98 percent'' of what he wanted.
Their bipartisan thinking was this: Republicans would so badly want to avoid cutting military spending that they would accept some tax increases. And Democrats would be so eager to avoid cuts in domestic programs, they would drop their opposition to reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
It has not worked out that way.
The blame game actually started last year. Republicans, including their presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, blamed Mr. Obama for the looming military cuts. The president typically described sequestration as easily avoidable with compromise, but in a debate with Mr. Romney he seemed to disown the idea altogether.
''The sequester is not something that I've proposed,'' he said. ''It is something that Congress has proposed. It will not happen.''
At that time, Republicans and Democrats generally assumed that sequestration would not happen because they would reach a compromise. But that was before Republicans angered their conservative base in January, by acquiescing to a tax law that raised rates on high incomes. Now they refuse to consider further revenue increases, and many want the sequestration cuts to take effect.
As this weekend arrived, Republicans were circulating a column by Mr. Woodward published online by The Washington Post on Friday, in which he wrote that Mr. Obama was ''moving the goal posts'' from what he had agreed to in the summer of 2011 by insisting that a sequestration substitute have tax increases as well as entitlement-spending reductions.
''Moving goal posts?'' the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, wrote in a Twitter message in response, adding that 40 House Republicans in November 2011 signed a letter supporting new revenues as part of a deal. Mr. Carney suggested in a later Twitter message that Mr. Woodward was ''willfully wrong.''
Mr. Obama vowed from the day he announced the agreement 19 months ago that he would insist on ''a balanced approach'' that cut entitlement spending and raised revenues by overhauling tax breaks. ''Everything will be on the table,'' he said.
The 2011 agreement left unspecified how to achieve the additional $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years. That fall a so-called supercommittee considered revenue increases totaling $300 billion in a Republican plan, $800 billion in Democrats' offer. With the super-committee's failure, Mr. Obama and Congress had a year to seek the elusive ''grand bargain.''

HEADLINE: Investors Rediscover Risk-Taking Abroad

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
RISK-TAKING may be staging a comeback overseas.
While equities around the world soared last year, the stock market rebound abroad was decidedly different from the one that sent the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 16 percent in 2012.
In the United States, the most economically sensitive stocks, like shares of banks and other financial businesses, posted the biggest gains as investors grew confident that an economic recovery was at hand. Overseas, by contrast, it was the defensive-oriented shares like health care and consumer staples stocks that performed the best for most of the year. 
What's more, investors favored stocks in the developed world over riskier but faster-growing emerging markets equities.
This is not all that surprising. ''The economic situation abroad in the last 12 to 18 months has either been worse or has slowed more dramatically than in the U.S., creating an even bigger 'risk off' mind-set in those markets,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.
Yet Mr. Paulsen believes that investors' appetite for risk-taking overseas is likely to improve. In fact, that process may have already begun.
Among the early signs are that economically cyclical sectors, like financial stocks in the MSCI EAFE index of foreign equities, have been outperforming defensive areas like health care and consumer staples since December.
Part of this can be attributed to the growing clarity about the state of the global economy, money managers say. It is not so much that the economy is booming, but that some of the greatest potential dangers seem to have receded.
Most prominently, concerns about a euro zone breakup have abated since Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, declared that the bank would do ''whatever it takes'' to save the euro. Ever since that announcement, in late July, European equities have been in rally mode.
''In the international markets, you saw the removal of major tail risks last year, particularly in Europe,'' said Jason A. White, a portfolio specialist at T. Rowe Price.
Meanwhile, fears over China's slowdown seemed to subside at the end of last year on signs that the world's second largest economy was finally beginning to re-accelerate. In November, government data showed that industrial output and retail sales in China grew much faster than expected, bolstering the bullish case for Chinese and emerging-market stocks. Since then, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index has soared nearly 20 percent.
The improving global economy, though, isn't the only reason risk-taking may be re-emerging.
Money managers note that fear over Europe's debt crisis has been driving investors into defensive-oriented stocks overseas for several years. This is particularly true for shares of consumer companies that manufacture staples like food and household products that continue to be in demand regardless of the health of the economy.
''In an environment where returns for the equity markets were quite poor, you saw very decent returns in those staples,'' said Harry Hartford, president of Causeway Capital Management. As a result, though, ''consumer staples outside the U.S. looks pretty fully priced,'' he said.
Take Diageo. Shares of the British spirits maker, which has sales in about 180 countries, have climbed more than 26 percent a year for the last three years. That means Diageo shares now trade at a price/earnings ratio of more than 18, based on forecast profits. By comparison, the average P/E for MSCI EAFE stocks is less than 14.
Unilever, the packaged food and household goods company, is another example. In 2008, amid the global financial crisis, the stock was trading at around 11 times earnings. Today, Unilever's P/E ratio stands at 17 times earnings.
''A lot of the defensive industries had big runs, so valuations got extended,'' said W. George Greig, head of international investing for the asset manager William Blair & Company. As a consequence, he said, ''some investors are starting to say that the defensive stocks aren't as defensive as they thought.''
NOT all money managers are convinced that the worst of the economic storm is behind us. ''We know that after a financial crisis, it takes a long time to recover,'' said Simon Hallett, chief investment officer for the asset manager Harding Loevner. ''We think a conservative approach is still appropriate -- there are still an awful lot of things that can go wrong.''
Mr. Greig said investors were not seeking economically sensitive stocks out of a newfound sense of euphoria. ''This is not a venturesome 'risk on' mind-set,'' he said. Rather, investors are reluctantly seeking out cyclically oriented stocks because their valuations are so low that they now look compelling, and there may be better values in areas that had been considered riskier.

HEADLINE: As Cuts Loom, Governors Seek More Control of Federal Funds to Lessen the Pain

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Governors of both parties said on Saturday that they knew federal budget cuts were coming, and they pleaded with President Obama and Congress to give them more discretion over the use of federal money so they could minimize the pain for their citizens.
The governors, arriving here for the winter meeting of the National Governors Association, said that the automatic across-the-board cuts in federal spending that are scheduled to begin at the end of the week were creating havoc, threatening jobs and sapping economic growth in their states. 
They urged the president and Congress to strike a deal that would allow state officials to set priorities and prune spending in a more selective way. They said the cuts would be easier to cope with if they had more freedom to decide how to allocate the savings in education, health care and public safety programs.
''We are just saying -- as you identify the federal cuts and savings -- give us flexibility to make the cuts where they will do the least harm to our citizens,'' said Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, a Republican and the vice chairwoman of the association. ''Don't balance the federal budget on the backs of state governments.''
Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat and the chairman of the association, said: ''Deficit reduction should not be accomplished simply by shifting costs from the federal government to the states or by imposing unfunded mandates. States should be given increased flexibility to create efficiencies and to achieve results.''
With more discretion, Mr. Markell said, governors could moderate the effects of the looming cuts.
''We know that cuts are coming, but we don't want to suffer disproportionately,'' Mr. Markell said. ''We want to have some input. We want a seat at the table.''
If the stalemate between Mr. Obama and Congress continues, the across-the-board cuts will begin to take effect Friday under a budget procedure known as sequestration.
''The uncertainty of sequestration is really harming our states and the national economy,'' Ms. Fallin said. ''I've already had several companies in Oklahoma tell me they are not going to expand because there's so much uncertainty, especially around our military installations. It's projected that we could lose up to 8,000 military jobs, with a multiplier effect on up to 20,000 jobs in Oklahoma's economy.''
Mr. Markell said: ''The uncertainty of how much will be cut, from where and when, can undermine our budget. It can also slow the economic growth in our states. State economies are slowly recovering and just returning now to the level of revenues we collected back in 2008.''
The governors put aside their partisan disagreements and united in sending an urgent message to Congress.
''We do need to get our national deficit down,'' Ms. Fallin said, ''but give us flexibility. Relax those mandates. Give us some leeway.''
Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, agreed that the federal deficit and debt were ''a serious risk,'' saying, ''We recognize that we will have to be part of the solution and share the pain.''
But Mr. Hickenlooper said the across-the-board cuts were a blunt instrument. ''Sequestration was originally designed by both the administration and Congress as something so odious, so repellent, that it would force both sides to a compromise,'' he said.
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican, said Congress should be ''more strategic'' in making cuts.
''I think there should be limited government, but I don't like random changes,'' Mr. Walker said. ''If you look at my budget, I did not do across-the-board cuts.''
Gov. Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii, a Democrat, said the automatic cuts could force layoffs of 19,000 workers at the Pacific Command and Pearl Harbor.
''That will undermine our capacity for readiness at Pearl Harbor,'' Mr. Abercrombie said, and it symbolizes what happens when Congress fails to meet its responsibilities.

SECTION: Section RE; Column 0; Real Estate Desk; LIVING IN | BATH BEACH, BROOKLYN; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 1280 words

HEADLINE: Assets Many, Listings Few

BYLINE: By VERA HALLER

 BODY:
At St. Finbar Roman Catholic Church, the Rev. Michael Louis Gelfant presides over a flock that spans an old and new Bath Beach.
He leads a Sunday morning Mass in English and Italian for parishioners, many of them Italian-Americans who have lived in this South Brooklyn neighborhood for decades. The afternoon Mass is celebrated in Spanish for more recent arrivals, many from Guatemala and Mexico.
Bath Beach is a neighborhood of melding communities, a long-ago beach resort along Gravesend Bay that became an Italian-American area and is now increasingly home to Chinese-American families and recent Latino immigrants.
As the ethnicities begin to blend, Father Gelfant said, some Hispanic families are attending special children's Masses in English, forgoing the Spanish versions later in the day. He views this as a result of the Spanish speakers' increasing comfort level with the language. 
He said parishioners had begun a fund-raising drive for the commission of a statue of Archangel St. Michael -- the patron saint of the cathedral in the Guatemalan town of Totonicapán, where many parishioners came from -- to be erected on church grounds. The effort was another sign that the Guatemalan community is growing roots here. ''It will be a very large statue,'' he said.
As for the growing Chinese population, it is drawn to Bath Beach -- a neat rectangle of about a square mile sandwiched between Bensonhurst and Gravesend Bay -- by its larger homes, good schools and subway access.
Eric Chan, a broker who owns Exit Realty Best in Bath Beach, says about 90 percent of the people he meets who are looking to buy in Bath Beach are of Chinese or Asian heritage. He pointed out the growing number of restaurants and markets on 86th Street, the main shopping area, that cater to Chinese residents.
According to 2010 census data that the city government sorted by neighborhood, 55 percent of Bath Beach's 29,931 residents were white, 30 percent were Asian and 13 percent Hispanic. The Asian and Hispanic populations had both grown by nearly 70 percent since the 2000 census, the numbers showed.
Mr. Chan says some Chinese buyers already own single-family homes in Bath Beach and are looking for places to accommodate multiple generations as their children marry and have families. Others are coming from Sunset Park in search of a quieter Brooklyn neighborhood, and still others are second-generation Chinese-Americans from Chinatown in Manhattan who want more space for their children and elderly parents. The neighborhood's multifamily houses are especially sought after, Mr. Chan said.
Kathy Samaris, a broker at Pecoraro Realty in Bath Beach who has lived in the area her whole life, said she welcomed the changes in demographics. She described many of the Italian-Americans who remain in Bath Beach as elderly people whose children had long since moved on to Long Island, New Jersey or Staten Island to start families of their own. The recent arrivals bring new life to the area. ''It's so nice to see the young children,'' Ms. Samaris said.
What You'll Find
According to Brooklyn Community Board 11, Bath Beach is defined by Gravesend Bay to the south, 86th Street to the north, 14th Avenue to the west and Bay Parkway to the east. Some brokers lump Bath Beach together with Bensonhurst, its neighbor to the north.
Although the Belt Parkway, built in the late 1930s by Robert Moses, precludes direct access to the water, its presence at the bottom of Bath Beach imparts a distinctive quality. Residential streets run north to south from 86th Street to the parkway, and many blocks open up to wide vistas of Gravesend Bay.
The most prevalent house style is the squared-off red-brick row house, often with a small front yard and a porch with an awning. There are also various multifamilies with two to four units, both wood-frame and brick. Among new options are midsize brick co-ops of as many as six units.
The area also has rentals. Along the Belt Parkway, for instance, is the 32-building campus of Shore Haven, built in 1949 by Fred Trump, Donald J. Trump's father. Immigrants from Mexico and Central America live in some of the rentals closer to Bath Avenue, where Guatemalan shops are popping up.
What You'll Pay
Anthony Mussolino, an associate broker at Ben Bay Realty, says one-family houses start around $500,000 and go higher depending on size and parking. Multifamilies begin at $650,000 and can reach $1 million, he said.
A search of Bath Beach properties on Trulia.com turned up 85 listings ranging from $199,000, for a one-bedroom one-bath co-op in a three-story brick building, to $1.1 million for a two-family with six bedrooms, four baths and a pool.
Mr. Mussolino, like other local brokers, said housing prices had dipped slightly during the economic downturn but were now back at pre-2007 levels. Tight inventory and a high demand have kept the prices strong, he said.
''The one- and two-family houses cater to young professionals as well as families with children,'' he said, extolling the attributes of homes close to the city with parking, a backyard and the added convenience of the Belt Parkway.
What to Do
Residents are well situated to take part in outdoor activities. The Belt Parkway Promenade, with 4.3 miles of waterfront walkway, is ideal for jogging, walking or in-line skating. The promenade offers spectacular views of the bay and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Residents can access the promenade via a footbridge over the highway near 17th Street, or by following Bay Parkway until it dead-ends at the water. Bensonhurst Park, at Cropsey Avenue and Bay Parkway, has playgrounds and basketball courts. Dyker Beach Park, which runs along Bath Beach's western border, has tennis courts, one of Brooklyn's two public golf courses (the other is in Marine Park), baseball fields and the CityPark Junior Golf Center.
Residents do most of their shopping on 86th Street, which has boutiques as well as chain retailers like the Gap and Marshalls. Caesar's Bay Shopping Center, on the bay off Bay Parkway, was damaged by flooding from Hurricane Sandy. Some stores, including Kohl's, remain closed.
The Commute
In addition to easy access to the Belt Parkway -- a conduit to the Verrazano, Staten Island and New Jersey in one direction and the parkways of Long Island in the other -- residents have good public transportation options. The D train runs on elevated tracks along 86th Street. Commuters heading to Rockefeller Center in Midtown from the Bay Parkway station have a 45-minute ride during rush hour. There are also two express buses, the X28 and X38. The trip to Lower Manhattan takes about 45 minutes.
The Schools
Mr. Mussolino cited the public elementary schools as a particular attraction. They include Public School 229 on Benson Avenue, which runs through Grade 8; P. S. 163 on Bay 14th Street, also through Grade 8; and P. S. 101 The Verrazano, on Benson Avenue, which stops after Grade 5. At the most sought after, P. S. 229, 82 percent of third graders last year met standards in English and 85 percent in math, versus 49 and 57 percent citywide. For high school, most students travel outside the neighborhood. SAT averages last year at the New Utrecht High School in Dyker Heights, which has about 3,200 students, were 416 in reading, 485 in math and 413 in writing, versus 496, 514 and 488 citywide.
The History
Named after the English spa town of Bath, the area started life as a waterside resort. Historical accounts describe yacht clubs and villas lining the bay, and a popular restaurant, Captain's Pier. There was even an amusement park, Ulmer Park, created by the Ulmer Brewery, with rides and a dance hall. It closed in 1899 as Coney Island gained a following.

HEADLINE: A Smith Asserts His Own Name

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
What took so long? Twenty-five years after he left the Smiths, perhaps the most influential British pop band of the 1980s, the guitarist Johnny Marr has finally made a solo album.
On ''The Messenger'' (Sire), due out on Tuesday, Mr. Marr has written not just the music, as he did in the Smiths, but also the lyrics for all 12 songs, and stepped forward to be the singer too. Every song opens with a guitar intro, and there are even some blazing guitar solos -- all big departures for a musician who has always prided himself on his collegiality, rather than seeking the spotlight.
''This record is a little bit of thinking and a whole lot of instinct,'' Mr. Marr, 49, said in a recent interview in New York. ''From the time I was 13 or 14 I've been thinking like part of a group. But in this case I didn't need to enable anybody else -- or be enabled by anybody else.'' He added, ''To do what I'm doing now I need not to be receptive to collaborations.'' 
It's not that Mr. Marr hasn't been active since the Smiths broke up, in the summer of 1987. If anything, he's been a wandering spirit, recording, writing for or touring with the Pretenders, Electronic, the The, Modest Mouse, Bryan Ferry, the Pet Shop Boys, Beck and most recently the Cribs. He has also written film scores and in 2010 played on the soundtrack of ''Inception.''
''The idea of looking at the same musicians year in and year out to me is weird if you don't need to do that,'' he said when asked about his restlessness. ''I understand the dynamic, but if you don't need to do it, why would you? I feel like I've been able to do what I want, the way I want. I would join a band, learn from that band and be committed and passionate and bring my thing to the band. Then, when I felt like we were going to repeat ourselves, and I needed to learn more, I would go somewhere else.''
The Smiths, of course, were famous for the intensely personal, even lugubrious lyrics that Morrissey, the group's lead singer, ripped from his diaries and notebooks. On ''The Messenger,'' in contrast, most of Mr. Marr's lyrics tend toward the abstract or enigmatic -- dystopian fantasies that address issues like the disconnect between man and technology.
''I didn't want to sing about my feelings,'' said Mr. Marr, slim, affable, soft-spoken and well dressed, his hair cut in classic British rock star style. ''There's this weird paradigm that has crept into all music, but particularly pop music, that unless one is singing from the very very depths of your soul, as loudly as possible, using every note in your limited range, then it's not authentic. That made me want all the more to sing from my mind, my analytical mind. I thought: Well what's wrong with singing from the brain? It doesn't make it any less authentic.''
But Mr. Marr's guitar playing, lyrical and melodic, is an entirely different matter. A student of the instrument, he has always enjoyed a reputation as one of the premier craftsmen of his generation, with a distinctively restrained sound and style that seems descended more from the tasteful chording of Pete Townshend, Nile Rodgers or Keith Richards than the solo pyrotechnics of an Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix.
In December Mr. Marr performed with Dinosaur Jr. in New York, playing the Smiths anthem ''The Boy With the Thorn in His Side'' as a guest at a live show. A few days later J. Mascis, that band's leader, offered this explanation for the invitation: Though he initially found the Smiths ''too wimpy'' when he saw them on MTV, and didn't much care for the fact that ''all you'd see and hear was Morrissey, Morrissey, Morrissey,'' he found Mr. Marr's guitar playing to be ''very cool, English and new.''
''It's just the sound he made,'' Mr. Mascis explained. ''He came up with interesting parts, and they were all so clean, which made it seem like they would be hard to play. Distortion makes it easy to play, so the cleaner a part, the more difficult it seems, and his parts were so intricate. And they are all there for the song, all part of the music, not solos sticking out and drawing attention to themselves: Look what I can play on guitar.''
''The Messenger'' is full of intricate, interlocking guitar parts as well as riffs and solos. But as Andy Rourke, the bass player in the Smiths, noted, Mr. Marr has made a point of bringing those embellishments forward in the mix, rather than burying or muddying them.
''I still love the Smiths' songs and the way they sound, but texturally they sound a lot thinner than what Johnny's doing right now,'' said Mr. Rourke, who now lives in New York, where he leads a duo, Jetlag, and has a Web radio show. (His interview with Mr. Marr, scheduled to run on Monday, is available here.) ''It's kind of a wall of sound, but not in a mushy way. It's clear, but it's a kind of 360-degree sound.''
Mr. Rourke, a friend of Mr. Marr's since both were 11 years old and living just outside Manchester, England, added that Mr. Marr's preference for a big, full sound actually harks back to one of their earliest musical interests, namely Phil Spector's recordings with girl groups like the Ronettes and the Crystals. That in turn underlines another essential point about Mr. Marr: Though the Smiths were a band strongly influenced by punk, he has a fondness for classic pop that he no longer feels a need to hide or deny.
''I like David Bowie's singing, but Ray Davies is my man,'' he said, referring to the leader of the 1960s band the Kinks, in response to a question about influences on his vocal style. He cited Chet Atkins and George Harrison as guitarists whose restrained, economical playing ''serves the song.'' And his inspiration for the package of frontman, singer and guitar player all in one? Marc Bolan of T. Rex was the first name that came to his lips.
Mr. Marr answers questions thoughtfully, pausing before he replies, and shows boyish enthusiasm when the subject turns to his favorite subjects: guitars and amps, the technology of the recording studio.
Though Mr. Marr recorded ''The Messenger'' in Manchester and Berlin, he and his family have in recent years been living in Portland, Ore. (Mr. Marr and his wife, Angela, have been married since 1985; they have two children.) He first went there in 2005, he said, ''on a 10-day experiment'' to write songs with Modest Mouse but decided to stay a while after he discovered that he enjoyed the city's ''liberal nature and very cool musical community,'' satirized in the television series ''Portlandia,'' in which Mr. Marr has appeared.
He has ''gone from being someone who partied very hard, in thrall to the image of Keith Richards, to someone who is now 100 percent vegan, a marathon runner, with very definite Buddhist tendencies to his lifestyle,'' said Tony Fletcher, author of a ''A Light That Never Goes Out,'' a new book about the Smiths. ''His enthusiasm is still the same as when he was 15 or 16 years old, and he's still in the same relationship as he was back then. But he really has made a very concrete and concerted effort to change himself as a person in other ways.''
The Smiths were always a political band, resolutely anti-monarchist, antiwar and contemptuous of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, attitudes Mr. Marr has retained. Morrissey absorbed much of the controversy his lyrics generated, but all four members shared a similar outlook, which Mr. Fletcher's book traces to their working-class and Irish-immigrant origins.
''In the U.K. if you were born Northern solidly working-class, that part of you is not going to change,'' Mr. Fletcher said. ''And Johnny came from a very poor background. The politics has always been there, and has not changed with success.''
Mr. Rourke agreed, citing the Red Wedge tour he and Mr. Marr made in support of the Labour Party in the mid-'80s. ''If you've been downtrodden yourself, it's something you pay attention to,'' he said. ''So we were always standing up for the poor guy, for Labour and against conservatism.''
Yet not long after he became leader of the Conservative Party in 2005 David Cameron proclaimed his admiration for the Smiths, and when he became prime minister in 2010, the Labour opposition mocked him in debate in Parliament by citing titles of Smiths songs like ''Miserable Lie'' and ''Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now.'' Mr. Cameron replied by mentioning other songs by the group, much to Mr. Marr's irritation.
''Stop saying that you like the Smiths, no you don't,'' Mr. Marr tweeted. ''I forbid you.'' Early last year, at an awards ceremony sponsored by the magazine New Musical Express, which just this month gave him its Godlike Genius Award, he raised the ante. ''If this government steps down, then I'll re-form the band,'' he said. ''How's that? That's a fair trade, isn't it?''
When it was suggested to Mr. Marr that the improbability of Mr. Cameron doing that made his own offer a clever and very effective way of deflecting the unending queries about a Smiths reunion, he smiled and chuckled. The last time he had any communication with Morrissey, he said, was ''probably a couple of years ago,'' when ''we did a couple of e-mails.'' But ''there's really no need to'' stay in touch, he added, and no point, at least artistically, in even contemplating a reunion.
''No, absolutely not,'' he said. ''It would have to be really special not to ruin the good work that we left -- very, very special. It's not like there was any unfinished business.''
On the other hand, Mr. Marr said, he could envision returning to the Cribs or Modest Mouse for new projects. But his immediate priorities, he quickly added, continue to be a long tour in support of the new CD and then, indulging his love of recording studios and their equipment, making another solo recording.
''I don't like to talk a good game, but when I went into this, I thought I'd be disappointed if I didn't get an opportunity to do at least three,'' he said. ''That would make sense of the whole thing for me. So this is absolutely not a one-off.''

HEADLINE: Major Banks Aid In Payday Loans Banned By States

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Major banks have quickly become behind-the-scenes allies of Internet-based payday lenders that offer short-term loans with interest rates sometimes exceeding 500 percent.
With 15 states banning payday loans, a growing number of the lenders have set up online operations in more hospitable states or far-flung locales like Belize, Malta and the West Indies to more easily evade statewide caps on interest rates.
While the banks, which include giants like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, do not make the loans, they are a critical link for the lenders, enabling the lenders to withdraw payments automatically from borrowers' bank accounts, even in states where the loans are banned entirely. In some cases, the banks allow lenders to tap checking accounts even after the customers have begged them to stop the withdrawals.
''Without the assistance of the banks in processing and sending electronic funds, these lenders simply couldn't operate,'' said Josh Zinner, co-director of the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, which works with community groups in New York. 
The banking industry says it is simply serving customers who have authorized the lenders to withdraw money from their accounts. ''The industry is not in a position to monitor customer accounts to see where their payments are going,'' said Virginia O'Neill, senior counsel with the American Bankers Association.
But state and federal officials are taking aim at the banks' role at a time when authorities are increasing their efforts to clamp down on payday lending and its practice of providing quick money to borrowers who need cash.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are examining banks' roles in the online loans, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter. Benjamin M. Lawsky, who heads New York State's Department of Financial Services, is investigating how banks enable the online lenders to skirt New York law and make loans to residents of the state, where interest rates are capped at 25 percent.
For the banks, it can be a lucrative partnership. At first blush, processing automatic withdrawals hardly seems like a source of profit. But many customers are already on shaky financial footing. The withdrawals often set off a cascade of fees from problems like overdrafts. Roughly 27 percent of payday loan borrowers say that the loans caused them to overdraw their accounts, according to a report released this month by the Pew Charitable Trusts. That fee income is coveted, given that financial regulations limiting fees on debit and credit cards have cost banks billions of dollars.
Some state and federal authorities say the banks' role in enabling the lenders has frustrated government efforts to shield people from predatory loans -- an issue that gained urgency after reckless mortgage lending helped precipitate the 2008 financial crisis.
Lawmakers, led by Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, introduced a bill in July aimed at reining in the lenders, in part, by forcing them to abide by the laws of the state where the borrower lives, rather than where the lender is. The legislation, pending in Congress, would also allow borrowers to cancel automatic withdrawals more easily. ''Technology has taken a lot of these scams online, and it's time to crack down,'' Mr. Merkley said in a statement when the bill was introduced.
While the loans are simple to obtain -- some online lenders promise approval in minutes with no credit check -- they are tough to get rid of. Customers who want to repay their loan in full typically must contact the online lender at least three days before the next withdrawal. Otherwise, the lender automatically renews the loans at least monthly and withdraws only the interest owed. Under federal law, customers are allowed to stop authorized withdrawals from their account. Still, some borrowers say their banks do not heed requests to stop the loans.
Ivy Brodsky, 37, thought she had figured out a way to stop six payday lenders from taking money from her account when she visited her Chase branch in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn in March to close it. But Chase kept the account open and between April and May, the six Internet lenders tried to withdraw money from Ms. Brodsky's account 55 times, according to bank records reviewed by The New York Times. Chase charged her $1,523 in fees -- a combination of 44 insufficient fund fees, extended overdraft fees and service fees.
For Subrina Baptiste, 33, an educational assistant in Brooklyn, the overdraft fees levied by Chase cannibalized her child support income. She said she applied for a $400 loan from Loanshoponline.com and a $700 loan from Advancemetoday.com in 2011. The loans, with annual interest rates of 730 percent and 584 percent respectively, skirt New York law.
Ms. Baptiste said she asked Chase to revoke the automatic withdrawals in October 2011, but was told that she had to ask the lenders instead. In one month, her bank records show, the lenders tried to take money from her account at least six times. Chase charged her $812 in fees and deducted over $600 from her child-support payments to cover them.
''I don't understand why my own bank just wouldn't listen to me,'' Ms. Baptiste said, adding that Chase ultimately closed her account last January, three months after she asked.
A spokeswoman for Bank of America said the bank always honored requests to stop automatic withdrawals. Wells Fargo declined to comment. Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for Chase, said: ''We are working with the customers to resolve these cases.'' Online lenders say they work to abide by state laws.
Payday lenders have been dogged by controversy almost from their inception two decades ago from storefront check-cashing stores. In 2007, federal lawmakers restricted the lenders from focusing on military members. Across the country, states have steadily imposed caps on interest rates and fees that effectively ban the high-rate loans.
While there are no exact measures of how many lenders have migrated online, roughly three million Americans obtained an Internet payday loan in 2010, according to a July report by the Pew Charitable Trusts. By 2016, Internet loans will make up roughly 60 percent of the total payday loans, up from about 35 percent in 2011, according to John Hecht, an analyst with the investment bank Stephens Inc. As of 2011, he said, the volume of online payday loans was $13 billion, up more than 120 percent from $5.8 billion in 2006.
Facing increasingly inhospitable states, the lenders have also set up shop offshore. A former used-car dealership owner, who runs a series of online lenders through a shell corporation in Grenada, outlined the benefits of operating remotely in a 2005 deposition. Put simply, it was ''lawsuit protection and tax reduction,'' he said. Other lenders are based in Belize, Malta, the Isle of Man and the West Indies, according to federal court records.
At an industry conference last year, payday lenders discussed the benefits of heading offshore. Jer Ayler, president of the payday loan consultant Trihouse Inc., pinpointed Cancún, the Bahamas and Costa Rica as particularly fertile locales.
State prosecutors have been battling to keep online lenders from illegally making loans to residents where the loans are restricted. In December, Lori Swanson, Minnesota's attorney general, settled with Sure Advance L.L.C. over claims that the online lender was operating without a license to make loans with interest rates of up to 1,564 percent. In Illinois, Attorney General Lisa Madigan is investigating a number of online lenders.
Arkansas's attorney general, Dustin McDaniel, has been targeting lenders illegally making loans in his state, and says the Internet firms are tough to fight. ''The Internet knows no borders,'' he said. ''There are layer upon layer of cyber-entities and some are difficult to trace.''
Last January, he sued the operator of a number of online lenders, claiming that the firms were breaking state law in Arkansas, which caps annual interest rates on loans at 17 percent.
Now the Online Lenders Alliance, a trade group, is backing legislation that would grant a federal charter for payday lenders. In supporting the bill, Lisa McGreevy, the group's chief executive, said: ''A federal charter, as opposed to the current conflicting state regulatory schemes, will establish one clear set of rules for lenders to follow.''

HEADLINE: Rays' Price Is Realistic About His Worth and His Future

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. -- David Price was shooting a commercial for a home-security company at his house in Tampa on Feb. 7 when his brother, Damon, called. Price ignored him once, then twice. With the third call, he finally picked up. He figured it must be important.
Damon was eager to share the news that Felix Hernandez, the ace of the Seattle Mariners, had agreed to a contract worth $175 million over seven years. The cost for elite pitchers had just crossed a threshold.
''I was like, Wow, that's insane,'' Price said Friday morning in the Tampa Bay Rays' spring training clubhouse. ''That's Monopoly money.'' 
He shook his head and laughed. Price, 27, won the American League Cy Young Award last season and is the hardest-throwing starting pitcher in the majors. In the last 12 months, peers like Matt Cain, Cole Hamels, Zack Greinke and now Hernandez have each signed for more than $125 million. Price is among the next in line.
With others -- Justin Verlander of the Detroit Tigers and Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers -- the question is: How much will their well-financed current teams pay? With Price, it is, when will the low-budget Rays deal him? Their contract with Evan Longoria, the star third baseman, runs through 2022. Nobody pretends they can afford another nine-figure deal, putting Price's future in limbo.
''But I don't think about it,'' Price said. ''I just don't. That's not why I play the game. I love the game. I've loved it since I was 2 years old. I enjoy being a part of an environment like this and doing stuff the way that we do stuff. It's the right way.''
The Rays have averaged nearly 92 victories a season since 2008, when they won the A.L. pennant with Price on the mound. He had been drafted first over all the previous June, and when he visited Tropicana Field, he received bags of free merchandise, only to learn that the trinkets would soon be obsolete. The next season, he was told, the team would drop its black-and-green color scheme and no longer be known as the Devil Rays.
It was Price's introduction to an organization in which nothing stays the same -- except a relentlessly creative operating philosophy. In 10 tries, the Devil Rays had only losing seasons. In five tries, the Rays have known only winning. To sustain that streak, they have traded several top starters, including Scott Kazmir, Matt Garza and, this winter, James Shields.
''There's nothing we do where we're not thinking about the future and how to extend our talent runway, to have the requisite depth to put us in position to have success in the American League East,'' General Manager Andrew Friedman said.
''So we're consumed by that. We're driven by that.''
The Rays have kept some stars until they reached free agency, including outfielders Carl Crawford and B. J. Upton. They could always do the same with Price, whose rights they retain through 2015. But the trade of Shields, who actually had more innings and strikeouts than Price last season, came with two years left on his deal and netted an impressive return.
The Rays sent Shields and another starter, Wade Davis, to the Kansas City Royals for a prospect package that included two pitchers and outfielder Wil Myers, Baseball America's minor league player of the year. Rays players understood the move.
''I get it,'' starter Matt Moore said. ''It's part of the game. This isn't Little League, where you get to play with your friends all the way up. I'm just grateful he was my teammate.''
Shields, 31, had been with the organization for 13 years, including 7 in the majors. He was a leader on the staff, a role that now falls mainly to Price, who enthusiastically fills it.
Each inning a fellow starter comes off the mound, Manager Joe Maddon said, Price is the first to greet him in the dugout. When a teammate throws live batting practice, Price stands behind the cage, encouraging him. Price invites teammates to his home to play video games, and his French bulldog, Astro, is the clubhouse mascot.
''Stuff like that, that goes so far,'' Maddon said. ''Those kinds of things are impactful. I don't know exactly how much, but I know it's great.''
Mostly, of course, Price leads with his left arm. According to Fangraphs, his average fastball last season was 95.5 miles per hour, best among major league starters. Yet he continued to grow as a pitcher, using the fastball less often and baffling hitters by throwing off-speed pitches nearly 40 percent of the time. He held opponents to a puny .276 slugging percentage with runners in scoring position.
The result was a 20-5 record and an A.L.-best 2.56 earned run average, and the Rays rewarded him with a one-year contract for a little more than $10 million, avoiding salary arbitration. Price said there were no active discussions on a long-term deal, but he has no plans to take a discount. An economics major at Vanderbilt, he has a strong grasp of the marketplace.
''As major league players, we're a brotherhood,'' Price said. ''We have to look out for other guys that are coming along, the next King Felix or the next C. C. Sabathia or Justin Verlander. Those guys are putting their work in now, whether they're in the minor leagues or still in high school.
''If we sign a lesser deal, or whatever the case is, it affects everybody, not just you. That's something you want to take into consideration, because people have obviously paved the way for us to make the money that we've been making. We're very fortunate, and we're very grateful.''
Friedman said that it was obvious that Price deserved a ''very substantial contract,'' and that the team would continue to evaluate his status. For now, he said, it makes most sense to concentrate on this season, and that seems fine with Price.
Price said he rarely thought about the business side of baseball until 2010, his first full year in the majors. He had signed for $8.5 million out of college, but teammates never held it against him. The hazing at his first training camp, he said, was harmless fun -- Troy Percival slapped a sticker of himself on the hood of Price's BMW, and Price drove around with it for a week.
The high jinks never seem to end around the Rays, a loose team with few rules. On the clubhouse bulletin board Friday, someone superimposed Maddon's likeness into a photo of Peyton and Eli Manning, poking fun at the manager's prowess as a small-college quarterback. Around the corner, the giant head of a wild boar hung from the locker of outfielder Luke Scott, who killed it with a spear.
Price said he had always liked being on the Rays -- the proximity to his Nashville home, the diversity of the roster, the chance to win. But he does not discount the possibility he might even be traded this season.
''Whether I spend the rest of my career here, whether I spend a half-year here, a year or more, I cherish this time -- because I know it's invaluable, what we have going on here,'' he said. ''You can't say enough about what this organization has done for me, how they've all taken me in.''
Soon enough, they may have to let him go, an outcome that might be necessary, even if neither side really wants it to happen. Price can appreciate the resourcefulness of the front office, even if it means he must leave someday to keep the talent runway moving.
''You can't knock it,'' he said, ''because what they've done has worked.''

HEADLINE: Hard Budget Realities As Agencies Prepare To Detail Reductions

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the first week of March, a laid-off person living on $300 a week in unemployment benefits is liable to find a surprise in the mailbox: notification from Uncle Sam that come April the check will be $33 lighter.
''Sequestration,'' that arcane budget term consuming Washington in recent weeks, is about to move from political abstraction to objective reality for tens of millions of Americans. Barring an extremely unlikely last-minute deal, about $85 billion is set to be cut from military, domestic and certain health care programs beginning Friday.
Much of the government will be immune, only magnifying the cuts for the rest. If they are not reversed, federal spending at the discretion of Congress will eventually fall to a new five-decade low. Cuts of even larger size are scheduled to take effect every year over the next 10, signaling an era of government austerity.
By the end of this week, federal agencies will notify governors, private contractors, grant recipients and other stakeholders of the dollars they would be about to lose. As of March 1, the Treasury Department will immediately trim subsidies for clean energy projects, school construction, state and local infrastructure projects and some small-business health insurance subsidies. 
Nearly two million people who have been out of work for more than six months could see unemployment payments drop by 11 percent in checks that arrive in late March or the first days of April, according to the White House budget office, an average of $132 a month. Doctors who treat Medicare patients will see cuts to their reimbursements.
If the stalemate in Washington continues, furloughs and layoffs will probably begin in April, starting largely in the 800,000-member civilian work force of the Defense Department and then rippling across the country, from meat inspectors in Iowa to teachers in rural New Mexico.
''If they hit me with a $3 million cut in March, I'm not sure what I'm going to do,'' said Raymond R. Arsenault, the superintendent of the Gallup-McKinley County Schools, a district that serves primarily Navajo students on the Arizona-New Mexico border.
Mr. Arsenault's school system would be hit much harder than most because 35 percent of his $100 million annual budget comes from federal education ''impact aid'' to offset the large tracts of land that are owned by Washington and therefore not subject to taxation. Of that, $3 million may be about to disappear.
The sequester involves trimming $85 billion from a $3.6 trillion annual federal budget, or about 2.4 percent. But the cuts will not affect Social Security or Medicaid, and the Medicare cuts total only about $11 billion in the 2013 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, according to calculations by the Bipartisan Policy Center.
Thus, entitlement spending, which poses the biggest long-term challenge to the federal budget, accounts for only a sliver of the cuts. That leaves more than $70 billion in cuts to be applied over the next seven months to the roughly two-fifths of the budget that is devoted to discretionary spending, including the military, education and dozens of other categories.
In a matter of weeks the cuts would cascade through the government, delaying snow removal on the Tioga Pass in Yosemite National Park, for example, and keeping an aircraft carrier battle group docked in Norfolk, Va., rather than steaming through the Persian Gulf.
''The cut is so big and over such a short period of time that there's no way to avoid all the operational and program harms,'' said Daniel I. Werfel, controller of the White House budget office.
These cuts would probably not be confined to 2013. Even if President Obama manages to persuade Congress to raise new revenue, he has said he would replace only half of the spending cuts with tax increases, in essence accepting a half-trillion dollars in cuts over 10 years. That would be on top of more than $1 trillion in cuts already enacted by the Budget Control Act, which created the sequester in 2011 as part of a deal to raise the country's statutory borrowing limit.
A comprehensive deficit-reduction deal, which is currently moribund but is still both Congress and the White House's stated goal, might mitigate the impact by including fast-growing programs like Medicare and Medicaid in the cuts. But belt-tightening, for now, appears to be the new normal.
In private, Capitol Hill staff members and members of Congress have admitted that there are no viable plans on the horizon to delay or offset the cuts. At best, Congress might be able to pass a bill giving agencies more discretion in carrying out the budget cuts. But that is opposed by the White House because officials fear that such a change would give lawmakers a false sense that they had done much to ease the pain of the cuts, when in fact, budget officials say, little would have changed.
That means that as of Friday, dozens of federal agencies must start bringing their budgets down to reduced levels by the end of the fiscal year. Given how much they have to cut, White House budget officials said, they will have no choice but to start the reductions immediately.
The worst hit by far would be the Defense Department, which is already absorbing a $500 billion budget cut over 10 years agreed to in 2011 and is operating under a temporary spending agreement even as it draws down the war in Afghanistan. Military personnel are exempted from furloughs, but civilian personnel are not, so the Pentagon is preparing to put hundreds of thousands of civilian workers on notice that they might lose 22 days of work this year.
''We have long argued that the responsible way to implement reductions in defense spending is to formulate a strategy first and then develop a budget that supports the strategy,'' Ashton B. Carter, the deputy secretary of defense, told Congress this month. Sequestration ''would achieve precisely the opposite effect by imposing arbitrary budget cuts that then drive changes in national security strategy.''
Throughout the government, the cuts would hit certain programs particularly hard without touching others. The National Institutes of Health, for instance, would need to cut about 5 percent of its annual budget in just seven months, meaning hundreds fewer research grants, said Kathleen Sebelius, the health secretary. Money for food safety inspection and air traffic controllers would also be cut.
Roughly 600,000 low-income women and children would stop receiving food aid. The Interior Department would issue 300 fewer leases for oil and gas production in Western states. NASA plans to cancel six technology development projects, including deep-space communications. National parks would close or curtail operations in their visitor centers, affecting hundreds of thousands of travelers.
The transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said on Friday that flights to major cities could be delayed by as much as 90 minutes because fewer air traffic controllers would be on the job.
Most Education Department programs are already fully financed for the current school year, so the big cuts would not occur until next September. But ''impact aid,'' which goes to school districts with untaxed federal lands, is paid during the school year and will be affected immediately.
Budget experts said the dollar amount of the cuts might not be devastating to government operations or to the economy, particularly if agencies had discretion in how they carried them out. ''Can we survive this? Of course we can. It's a $16 trillion economy,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''Cutting wisely, not stupidly, is a good idea. We've got what everybody thinks is a stupid way to cut.''
In some cases, small cuts can take big tolls. Because meat and poultry plants cannot operate without federal inspectors on site at all times, one furloughed inspector would shut down an entire plant.
Alarmed, J. Patrick Boyle, the president of the American Meat Institute, sent a letter on Feb. 11 to Mr. Obama asserting that keeping inspectors home would violate federal law. ''I respectfully request that, in the event of sequestration, U.S.D.A. meat and poultry inspectors not be furloughed so that the secretary of agriculture can fulfill his statutory obligations,'' he wrote.
But the request, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack replied, would run counter to the legal requirement he faces under sequestration.

HEADLINE: New York Builds Momentum in Sports

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
New Yorkers like to think they live in the center of the universe, and when it comes to finance, theater, advertising and other areas, they may be right. But when it comes to sports, the argument is shakier. Sure, the Yankees are perennial contenders and the Giants, among others, have at times risen to the top. But for all the money in New York, many of its teams fail to grab the national stage.
In the next few years, though, the New York metropolitan area will host numerous marquee events that will thrust it into the sports spotlight. This summer, the major league baseball All-Star Game will be played at Citi Field, followed next year by the first outdoor cold-weather Super Bowl, at MetLife Stadium. A few weeks later, basketball fans will head to Madison Square Garden to see the final rounds of the East Regional of the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament. By then, the N.B.A. will probably have decided whether the 2015 All-Star Game will be played at the Garden or at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. 
Throw in the N.F.L. and N.B.A. drafts in Manhattan and the N.H.L. draft at Prudential Center in Newark, as well as annual events like the United States Open tennis tournament and the New York City Marathon, and New Yorkers will have a full slate of top-flight sports to attend.
The convergence is not accidental. Sports leagues tend to reward teams that build new arenas and stadiums by letting them host title games and other high-profile events. After a spasm of construction in the 1960s and '70s, few new sites were built in the New York area.
In the last seven years, however, the Mets, the Yankees, the Jets, the Giants, the Nets and the Devils have moved into new homes, and the Knicks and the Rangers play in the Garden, which is in the midst of a nearly $1 billion renovation. The construction was prompted by the desire to replace aging buildings coupled with relatively low interest rates and tax incentives, as well as encouragement from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has seen sports as a key to attract dollars to the city.
''This is the harvest of a great period of building, but also the result of a lot of strategic thinking,'' said Robert A. Boland, who teaches at the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. ''New York City has taken a much more active footing in seeking mega-events, and it's great from a sports and tourism viewpoint.''
The economic justification for investing in sports is well known, though hotly debated. Stadiums and arenas attract local and out-of-town fans who spend hundreds and even thousands of dollars, create jobs and can become centerpieces of real estate development. The All-Star Game at Citi Field this summer is expected to produce economic benefits topping $190 million, according to the mayor's office, nearly 18 times as much as a Yankees playoff game.
''The investments we've made in the city's infrastructure, including our stadiums and arenas, are clearly paying off in the form of record tourism and the resulting economic dividends,'' the mayor said in a statement, which cited an 18.7 percent increase in tourism since 2006. ''New York City is the world's biggest stage, and we've shown that we can pull off a big event like no one else. New York City always puts on a good show, and the leagues are clearly taking notice.''
The latest potential addition to the sports calendar is the N.B.A. All-Star Game. Last week, Commissioner David Stern confirmed that the Knicks and the Nets have applied to host the game in 2015, and because no other cities have applied, it is a near certainty that the game will be in New York, which last hosted the event in 1998.
In theory, the Knicks and the Nets could share the event with, say, the dunking contest in one arena and the game in the other. More likely, though, one site will be chosen, inflaming the growing rivalry between the teams.
The teams observed league protocol and declined to comment on their bids. But they were not shy about promoting their buildings.
''We look forward, with our nearly $1 billion investment in the Garden transformation, to ensuring that we continue to attract high-profile events to our arena and New York City,'' Hank Ratner, president of the Madison Square Garden Company, said in a statement.
Brett Yormark, the chief executive of Barclays Center and the Nets, said that hosting boxing matches, college basketball games and other events helped put his arena on the map outside the city.
''We want to host events with national appeal,'' he said. ''It creates value for our naming rights partner, and it's important to be seen nationally because boxers, artists and others will aspire to perform on our court and stage.''
For all of sports' appeal, critics contend that stadiums and arenas rarely generate the economic benefits that their backers claim because cities, including New York, provide builders with hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other subsidies that could be used for other things, like hospitals and schools. Others argue that New York is already one of the most visited cities and does not need an All-Star Game, for instance, to boost tourism.
But with cities like Indianapolis and Orlando, Fla., campaigning heavily to host events and sports organizations, officials in New York want to remain a fixture not just for fans, but for leagues like the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. that have their headquarters in the city.
''The biggest payoff for New York is having these associations,'' said John Tepper Marlin, who worked as the chief economist in the city comptroller's office. Other cities, he said, have ''modest ambitions to become the amateur sports capital, but New York is the pro sports capital.''

HEADLINE: Overcoming Obstacles To Better Health Care

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
AMERICANS spend far more on health care than people in other countries and we have little to show for it. And as we live longer after retirement, the share that will be paid by the government will rise.
Unfortunately, no single change will transform our health care delivery system into one that we can afford. We are going to have to try lots of new approaches that depart from standard practices.
I have several suggestions that I think would help, including an experiment that would require a change in either state or federal regulations: giving some high-quality health care providers the opportunity to practice in a world without malpractice lawsuits. 
To me, the ideal health care delivery system would include:
¶ A fee for health rather than fee for service model. Doctors and hospitals should be paid for keeping their patients well. Paying them for doing more tests and surgeries creates bad incentives.
¶ A scientific, evidence-based approach to everything it does. Although this sounds unobjectionable, as soon as we get into some details you can see that it is easier to say than to do. For example, consider setting guidelines for when to use expensive imaging technology such as M.R.I. and CT scans.
Not only are such tests expensive, but they can lead to more, sometimes pointless, expensive procedures. A CT scan conducted to investigate a symptom will often find a small unrelated abnormality. These tiny masses are sometimes called ''incidentalomas.'' The vast majority of them are benign, and further testing can be expensive, worrisome and dangerous, leading to interventions that cause serious side effects or even death. But a few incidentalomas are portents of real disease. The problem is that as technology improves, it can lead to more accidental discoveries, and we need thoughtful guidelines to avoid leaving lots of patients unnecessarily anxious, scarred and broke.
¶ More employment of midlevel professionals like pharmacists, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, to give primary care physicians more time to talk to their patients. While I don't want to be treated by someone exceeding his level of competence, many of these professionals are underused. A goal should be to allow all members of the health care team to work to the full extent of their expertise, something that is not currently the norm. This would free primary care physicians to spend more time with patients.
¶ A requirement that all patients meet with their doctors or trained end-of-life counselors and prepare living wills. I am not suggesting that anyone be required to make any particular choices about these difficult end-of-life questions, merely that patients talk about the trade-offs and make some choices before they are incapable of doing so.
We now spend a disproportionate amount of money during the final months of people's lives, often with little hope of meaningfully extending them. We should at least make sure that patients are given the opportunity to opt out of spending their final days in a hospital, hooked up to tubes and running up enormous bills.
MANY fine providers do some of these things now, but they face an important impediment. They worry that if they stop administering a test that might cause more harm than good, or take steps to fully use the abilities of assistants, they will be sued for malpractice. As it is now, a doctor or hospital can be sued if the plaintiff can show that ''normal standards of care'' were not followed, even if those normal standards of care are inappropriate.
Thus, to encourage high-quality health care providers to adopt sensible practices, let's offer an inducement. Those with a record of providing high-quality care at good value could apply to the government for a safe harbor from malpractice suits. Organizations that receive this status could require patients to waive their right to sue for adverse outcomes. Of course, no patient would be forced to stick with such a provider, and with the new rules on pre-existing conditions under the health care reform law, those who wanted to retain their right to sue could go elsewhere. And an organization could lose this right if its quality declines.
Courts have previously ruled that such waivers are illegal, presumably because they do not believe patients should be trusted to make this judgment, but the experiment I suggest can test this concept in a limited way, starting with only the highest quality providers.
Personally, I would gladly give up my right to sue. Maintaining it is implicitly costing me money, for which I get little in return. Over the past five years, malpractice insurance companies have paid out to patients only 37 percent of the premiums they collect, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. About 40 percent of that money goes to lawyers, meaning that patients end up with less than a quarter of the dollars that doctors and hospitals pay for insurance. That is a return that makes state lotteries look like good investments.
Tort reform is a complicated subject and not a panacea. Texas capped malpractice awards for noneconomic damages at $250,000 in 2003, yet health care costs have not fallen. But tort reform deserves a better test.
To be clear, I am not proposing that this change be made universally. My suggestion is that we experiment by offering patients the option of selecting a health care provider with a record of quality that requires patients to waive certain rights to sue.
When it comes to my health, I would rather my doctor base her decisions on science rather than what she, or some lawyer, thinks will stand up in court.

GODS LIKE USOn Movie Stardom and Modern Fame
By Ty BurrIllustrated. 413 pp. Pantheon Books. $28.95.
Admit it. You idolize George Clooney and know he'd be your close friend, or at least a good drinking buddy -- if only you'd ever met. And that mass schadenfreude the culture indulges in whenever Lindsay Lohan crashes another car -- isn't that comforting? Stars may be rich or beautiful, but we get to feel sane in comparison.
In ''Gods Like Us,'' a penetrating, lively cultural history of movie stardom, Ty Burr doesn't lose sight of those and other paradoxes as he examines the idolatry and the illusion of intimacy, the worship and the resentment, the willed belief in an image we secretly know to be a mask. That unwavering focus on our push-pull relationship with screen icons from the days of silent films through cellphones, and a sophisticated sense of how films both reflect and shape culture, add freshness to what sounds like a worn-out topic. 
I might have liked this book just for the dead-on way it defines Tom Cruise's persona: ''maximum charisma with minimum depth.'' Burr, a film critic for The Boston Globe and a former writer for Entertainment Weekly, has a witty, readable style, but don't let that pop facade fool you. There is substance here, as he dissects how each period in American history finds or creates stars to serve its needs.
Back in 1910, the now forgotten Florence Lawrence was at the center of the first movie-related street crowd, as fans tore at her clothes trying to get near her during a personal appearance in St. Louis. They had only recently learned her name, because in the earliest days actors weren't credited on-screen. Soon those unknowable figures became familiar, as the screen magnified the country's desires and ambitions. In the '30s and '40s, Bette Davis showed women that they could be strong-willed, Ava Gardner that it was O.K. to be blatantly sexy. Clark Gable, at the height of his stardom during the Depression, gave audiences an image of unquestioned masculine swagger, confidence and virility at a time when so many unemployed men may have felt emasculated.
The culture always outgrows its idols, though. In the '60s and '70s, the old movie-star model -- a steady, studio-crafted persona carried through film after film -- gave way to a natural approach, which, Burr carefully notes, is merely the illusion of naturalness. Dustin Hoffman embodied this new ''dialectic in star culture,'' reconciling art and celebrity. Was he really an ordinary schlub or expertly acting like one?
A book of such scope is bound to have some bare patches. Burr's detour into music, with Elvis and the Beatles, seems necessary -- movie fame isn't self-contained -- yet skimpy. He might have said much more about politics, beyond a glancing mention that one Hollywood actor parlayed celebrity into the presidency of the United States.
But heading toward the present, Burr shrewdly discerns how stardom changed with television and video, as the celebrities got closer to home, closer to our size. Today, as movie stars flash across cellphone screens, ''they are finally much smaller than we are.'' When anyone with a cheap camera and Internet access can be a YouTube star, fame itself becomes devalued. If we feel drawn to Clooney in the old paradoxical way, it's because he follows the archaic Cary Grant model: a consistent personality no matter the film.
What does this mean for us? I think Burr overstates his case in saying that America once found stable identities in stars and that losing this ''luxurious fantasy of the fixed self'' leaves us adrift. But it's the mark of a valuable, provocative book that it can make us laugh, think and argue about the starry contradictions that are so profound a part of our lives, whether we like to acknowledge their importance or not.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: The Future of Medicare

 BODY:
Readers weigh in on problems with the health care program.
To the Editor:
The Medicare budget is now facing economic pressure that will force political leaders to make difficult choices to extend the solvency of the program. Medicare is already paying more in benefits than it receives in income.
As a result, the Medicare trustees in their most recent report issued a ''Medicare funding warning'' again, for the sixth straight year. Yet despite the looming crisis, before lawmakers start cutting benefits, raising premiums or increasing taxes, let's fix Medicare first and make it worth saving.
Over the years, Medicare has become more complicated and confusing for the beneficiaries covered by this insurance plan. For example, it now includes four parts, A, B, C and D, each with different yearly deductibles, co-payments and monthly premiums. 
In addition, beneficiaries are confronted with many other complex and expensive decisions, like whether to buy a Medicare supplement insurance policy as protection against skyrocketing deductibles and co-payments, or which of the many Part D prescription drug plans is the right choice for them. Regrettably, there are no Medicare field offices for a face-to-face interview to help customers make an informed decision. Instead, beneficiaries are directed to call 1-800-MEDICARE or to visit www.medicare.gov for help.
While lawmakers must address the ominous Medicare financing crisis, their first priority should be to fix Medicare and transform it into a user-friendly health insurance program with one monthly premium and reasonable co-payments for all services. After all, why ask taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries to pay more money to support an obsolete health insurance program when a far better plan is within reach?
THOMAS M. CASSIDY Stony Brook, N.Y., Feb. 18, 2013
The writer, an economist, is a clinical associate professor of social welfare at Stony Brook University and a former senior investigator for the New York State attorney general's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.
Readers React
Canada's Medicare program -- phased in at the same time as the American version -- shows how we can make Medicare simpler and thriftier, while simultaneously upgrading its coverage. Canada's program covers all Canadians (not just the elderly) under a single public program in each province, and bans co-payments and deductibles.
Patients can choose any doctor and hospital. Cutting out private insurers and the complexity and fragmentation they impose has simplified paperwork for patients, doctors and hospitals. Administrative costs are roughly half United States levels, saving more than $1,000 per capita.
Over all, Medicare spending on the elderly has grown three times faster in the United States than in Canada since 1980, while life expectancy (for the elderly, as for all age groups) has grown faster in Canada. If American Medicare costs had risen at Canadian rates, we'd have saved more than $2 trillion by now, and Medicare's trust fund would show a healthy surplus.
STEFFIE WOOLHANDLER DAVID U. HIMMELSTEIN New York, Feb. 20, 2013
The writers, internists and professors at the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, co-founded Physicians for a National Health Program.
As a professional and a Medicare subscriber, I have found the program's customer service to be unfailingly efficient and polite. I could never say the same for private insurers. I agree with Mr. Cassidy that rather than cut Medicare, we can change it, but I believe that I might differ in how.
Our Congress can change Medicare if it is serious about real savings. How many billions would it save to cut all subsidies for Medicare Advantage plans; allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices for Medicare Part D with pharmaceutical companies; and take for-profit companies out of Part D entirely?
Medicare is seamless in paying my fees, and paying for care when I need it. The fees Medicare pays are very low, and cutting them further is not a good cost-cutting maneuver. It hurts small businesses like mine and that of my primary care physician; both of us have the same expenses we have always had.
Medicare could run its own show with no private subsidies to for-profit entities. We seniors would be better off.
VIRGINIA D. REIBER Boston, Feb. 20, 2013
The writer is a clinical psychologist.
Mr. Cassidy's proposed fix is sensible but is far short of what is needed.
Medicare is headed for bankruptcy because it depends largely on open-ended fee-for-service payment of almost any services providers choose to deliver, at prices mainly determined by the providers. Compounding the problem, most providers act like independent businesses seeking to increase their income, regardless of whether they are for-profit or investor-owned.
An effective Medicare fix would require a new payment system that prospectively pays providers for comprehensive care at a rate set by a single public payer. It would also need a not-for-profit medical care system based on multispecialty doctor groups that pay physicians by salary, thus minimizing incentives to deliver duplicative or unnecessary care.
The new system would have to be mandatory for all citizens, including legislators, and it would have to be financed by a progressive, earmarked health care tax.
Obviously, such reform would be slow and difficult, but so would any other change that threatened vested interests. All reform will depend on an aroused public opinion.
ARNOLD S. RELMAN Tucson, Feb. 21, 2013
The writer is professor emeritus of medicine and social medicine at Harvard Medical School and a former editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine.
Medicare suffers from an economic ''tragedy of the commons.'' Every stakeholder in the Medicare program has an incentive to overuse the system for his own benefit. In the end, when exploitation of Medicare exceeds its finite capacity, the resource is destroyed.
The Medicare patient has an incentive to accept expensive treatment because it seems to be free and is enthusiastically recommended by the physician. The physician has an incentive to offer high-cost services because she is paid well to do so. Compensate physicians on almost any basis other than piecework fee-for-service, and you remove the incentive to overtreat.
In the end, the appetite of Americans for Medicare treatment will always exceed the capacity of the Medicare system to provide it while controlling costs. By any other name, cost containment requires rationing (limitation) of services.
Rationing medical services is not itself immoral. Some methods of rationing are often inequitable. After all, we ration by a person's ability to afford insurance. The most effective rationing is achieved when an unnecessary medical service is neither requested by the patient nor recommended by the physician. Properly structuring incentives makes this more likely.
THOMAS SHAPIRO San Jose, Calif., Feb. 20, 2013
The writer is a retired surgeon.
Mr. Cassidy's plea to simplify the rules for gaining access to Medicare benefits makes good sense, but doing so will not be enough to ''fix Medicare.''
The greatest threat to Medicare's continued ability to serve elderly and disabled Americans is its failure so far to contain its spending. Indeed, the failure to contain health care costs is a characteristic of the American health care system as a whole.
A multipronged approach can help reach the goals of more reliable quality of care and lower costs: paying providers to care for patients instead of to provide individual services; electronic medical records and other advances that can increase the probability that the services doctors recommend will really benefit patients; and new provider organizations -- accountable care organizations -- that take responsibility for the health of the patients who enroll with them.
This strategy can both improve the quality of services provided and bring health system costs under control. It will take time, and it won't be easy.
Providers and patients alike will need to learn from unfolding experience. If successful, the payoff will be durable improvements not only to Medicare but to the American health care system as a whole.
STEPHEN M. DAVIDSON Brookline, Mass., Feb. 21, 2013
The writer, a professor at the Boston University School of Management, is the author of the forthcoming book ''A New Era in U.S. Health Care: Critical Next Steps Under the Affordable Care Act.''
Mr. Cassidy discusses various problems facing Medicare, in particular its solvency and transparency. With respect to the first issue, it may be worth noting that any remnant of personal responsibility is completely lacking in the program.
There are numerous health problems that are a result of lifestyle choices, including emphysema (smoking) and obesity (lack of exercise and poor eating habits). But Medicare pays regardless of the cause.
If one burns down his own house, insurance payments are generally withheld. Withholding such payments for problems caused by irresponsible behavior would have two effects. There would be an immediate savings in Medicare costs, while in the long run people would be healthier, their poor choices no longer being subsidized.
Such an approach may appear draconian to some, but all the low-lying fruit has already been picked. Eventually, difficult choices have to be made.
WILLIAM VAUGHAN Jr. Chebeague Island, Me., Feb. 20, 2013
The Writer Responds
As Drs. Woolhandler and Himmelstein say, there are lessons in efficiency and simplicity to be learned from Canada's single public health program, which provides coverage for all Canadians. But after the polarizing campaign that resulted in the passage of the Affordable Care Act, legislators in the United States have sent a clear message that the fragmentation in the health care system, like Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance, will remain in place for the foreseeable future.
As a result, Medicare cannot rely on a single-payer system to rescue it from dysfunction. Instead, Medicare can and must make meaningful changes for beneficiaries and providers alike. As I said before, Medicare should be simple to use, easy to understand and affordable for beneficiaries. But reform must also include cost containment to save Medicare for future generations.
Although the new types of payment systems recommended independently by Professor Davidson and Dr. Relman provide a far better approach for controlling skyrocketing costs than today's fee-for-service model, these types of fundamental reforms are uncertain and take time.
Medicare must immediately reduce its risk for exploitation, whether by outright fraud or billing for medically unnecessary services. Medicare processes more than four million claims each business day from 1.5 million providers. Trying to identify all of the bogus claims submitted to Medicare is an insurmountable challenge.
Therefore, to protect the integrity of the program, Medicare must raise enrollment standards so that only first-rate professionals and businesses with established credentials can earn the privilege to participate in the program.
The time to act is now; time is not on our side.

HEADLINE: The Great Air Race

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
Because a room with a view has always been preferable to one without, the price of air in New York City is becoming more expensive. Yes, the air is for sale, but not on sale.
And not the dodgy urban air the city's eight million inhabitants breathe as they scurry around the boulevards, but the rarefied and fast-disappearing air overhead where condominium towers do not fear to tread, and rooms with sunlit windows can make the lucrative difference between a legal three-bedroom residence and a mere two-bedroom with a den/office.
With Manhattan's skyscraper-proof bedrock in finite supply and the city's fixation on housing and envelope-pushing office buildings on the upswing -- and also the impetus behind the proposed rezoning of 70 blocks around Grand Central Terminal called Midtown East -- the sky is not only the limit, it's the solution. Ubiquitous developers-about-town like Gary Barnett, Harry B. Macklowe and the Zeckendorf brothers are all not-so-secret members of the air appreciation society. 
''When I tell people outside of New York that I'm buying air from other building owners, they look at me as if I've lost my mind,'' said Kenneth S. Horn, the president of Alchemy Properties. His 18-story Isis Condominium at 303 East 77th Street acquired air rights from two adjacent tenements; it cantilevers eight feet above the roofs of both of them beginning at the sixth floor. The payoff for this complex and expensive undertaking is 360-degree views, more spacious apartments, abundant light and higher resale value.
''If the real estate gods line up,'' Mr. Horn said, ''and I find a site in a friendly neighborhood where I can and do buy air rights, and then let's say I can't build any higher, but if they let me cantilever, I can create views and add square footage to my project.''
Air rights are, in actuality, not fluffy chunks of available or orphaned air. They are unused or excess development rights gauged, like building density or lot size, by the square foot and transferable, when zoning permits it, from one buildable lot to another. They have become the reigning currency of the redevelopment realm, major components in the radical vertical transformation of the city's skyline.
These days developers don't just tailor their blueprints to the lot they own: they often annex, for fees that can run into the multimillions, the airspace above and around their property. The process, essentially an invisible merger of building lots that tranlates into taller, heftier towers with increased profitability, is emerging from a minislump dictated by the economy.
''The trading of air rights is more prevalent than it's ever been before,'' said Robert Von Ancken, an air-rights expert and appraiser who is the chairman of Landauer Valuation and Advisory Services, ''and it's why you're seeing these monster buildings springing up all over town. All of these new supertowers that are changing the look of the city's horizon, they couldn't happen without air-rights transfers.''
Mr. Von Ancken estimates that air rights trade for 50 to 60 percent of what the earth beneath them would sell for. Once sold, they are gone for good, a detail that occasionally adds a serious stress component to negotiations.
Unless the property doing the selling is a designated city landmark, these deals are usually restricted to properties that share at least 10 feet of lot line. Landmarks can sell their unused air rights to neighbors across the street or down the block.
Not all small-fry neighbors opt to sell: ''We get turned down more often than not,'' said Michael Namer, the chief executive of Alfa Development, who bought air rights to expand two of his downtown condominium projects, the eight-story, 36-unit Village Green on East 11th Street, and the nearly completed 14-story, 51-unit Chelsea Green on West 21st Street. Both are in height-restricted neighborhoods.
''There are people who believe in skyscrapers and people who don't,'' he added, ''and you can't do the Hudson Rail Yards and you can't do One57 without air rights, but that's not really the issue. The city Planning Department has taken steps to ensure that the way we sculpt our city is something that makes sense in terms of light and air. The reason behind the big increase in air-rights trades is that, bottom line, they can make the difference between a marginal and a profitable project.''
Post-recession, the air above New York City is its own best marketing tool.
''It's coming back with a vengeance,'' said Robert A. Jacobs, a land-use specialist and partner at Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman. ''The technology available is such that if you're a developer of a residential property you should build as high as you can, because you get the higher sales price for the higher floors. The race to accumulate light easements and air rights is tied to the mandate for these high-priced condos to offer views worthy of the purchase price,'' added Mr. Jacobs, who lectures on air rights at the city bar association.
If there is a danger inherent in them, it is the potential, Mr. Jacobs mused, for a city dominated by towers that overshadow the rest of the landscape.
''Is the future of the city going to be this series of 200-story towers with stultified buildings in between?'' he asked. ''You wonder how this will affect the street life, the trees. You wonder about urban plazas surrounded by 50-story walls: what would grow there, mushrooms?''
Before 1916, air and light were not an inalienable right of New Yorkers, but since then zoning rules have imposed varying height restrictions on new construction. The concept of air rights, also called transferable development rights (T.D.R.'s), as a salable commodity came about after a 1961 revamping of city zoning regulations that established density quotas for every block.
The restrictions are defined by the ratio of floor area to lot size; the floor-area-ratio (F.A.R.) determines a building's permissible bulk and varies by zone as well as by its position on a block or boulevard. Corner and boulevard sites have fewer restrictions than side streets, particularly in matters of height.
As Donald J. Trump demonstrated with his 72-story black glass tower at 845 United Nations Plaza, which was at one time the tallest residential building in the city, it is possible for a tower to, well, tower over its neighbors if it has successfully transferred sufficient air rights. Mr. Trump performed a dominolike maneuver and legally stockpiled air rights from at least seven low-rise properties that had F.A.R. to spare, merging their lots with his. Then -- presto -- he maxed out the block's allowable density in the form of a single slender tower.
Controversial when it was built, Trump World Tower has its defenders. ''You could subscribe to the theory that towers like these are the Empire State Buildings of the 21st century,'' said Joshua Stein, a prominent commercial real estate lawyer.
''In the real estate market,'' he added, ''some projects are very buffeted by the economic winds and some aren't, but residential development projects are often the first to get buffeted. And now we're in a market where people are developing again, which is why we're talking about development rights again. Whenever you see a potential rezoning, like we're seeing with Midtown East, you create unused development potential: you're dumping a whole lot of untapped value on property owners.''
In the last six months of 2012, Robert I. Shapiro, the president of City Center Real Estate, a brokerage that specializes in land assemblage and development rights deals, was involved in the negotiations of 11 transactions totaling 291,623 square feet of air rights, with an aggregate worth of $75 million in sales. He has, he said, been busy.
''That's what I do for a living, I sell air, and there is a lot more to doing air-rights deals than knocking on the door of the guy who owns the property next door,'' he said. ''The art of land assemblage and the acquisition of air rights is a high-stakes poker game, and because some of these transactions can take a decade or more to complete, you need the patience of Job.''
The accumulation of air rights for 432 Park Avenue, the site of the former Drake Hotel and the future site of the city's tallest residential tower at 95 stories, began back in 2004, even before the involvement of Mr. Macklowe, who visualized the luxury skyscraper, and CIM Group of Los Angeles, which now owns the property. When the Host Marriott Corporation sold the site to Mr. Macklowe for $418.3 million in 2006, it had already acquired nearly 115,000 square feet of buildable air rights, according to Mr. Shapiro. Perfect fodder for an $82.55 million penthouse.
Supply and demand dictate the price of air rights: 20 years ago, $45 a square foot was considered a reasonable fee, but in recent years the norm in prime neighborhoods has crept toward $450 a square foot.
According to one real estate professional, along the High Line corridor, a 21st-century development-rights hot spot, the air rights of a low-rise building desired by a high-rise condominium traded for more than the land beneath it.
''There's a price on everything in New York, and the air is no exception,'' said Ross F. Moskowitz, a partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who specializes in land use and zoning. ''From the viewpoint of real estate, air is simply invisible land, because you can build on it. Sometimes the air above, behind, to the left or right is worth far more than the building that carries the rights to it; it's a potential pot of gold for many properties. It's found money.''
Think of One57, the unfinished Midtown juggernaut that soars 90 stories above 57th Street; two duplexes there have already sold for more than $90 million each. Its developer, Gary Barnett of Extell, who is generally considered the grandmaster of the chess game that empowers air-rights assemblages, spent more than 15 years, and umpteen millions, buying up unused air rights from a string of smaller properties surrounding his tower. His objective: vertiginous height accompanied by this city's notion of priceless perfection: enhanced Central Park views.
One of Mr. Barnett's stops along the way to piling up the mountain of air rights that helped make his trophy tower possible was Joyce Manor, a 10-story prewar co-op at 140 West 58th Street. When Amy Casey moved into a tiny penthouse there in 2004, she was told that it came with air rights attached; she envisioned someday expanding her 600-square-foot space, perhaps creating a duplex with enhanced views of Carnegie Hall. She found out her air rights were worthless in terms of personal expansion: zoning did not permit it. But the aggregate air rights owned by the co-op were salable, and Mr. Barnett was buying.
''I owned something that was worthless to me,'' said Ms. Casey, a vice president of Halstead Property, ''but when One57 came along, we sold our air rights to Gary Barnett just like every other midrise on the block. I didn't get money in my pocket, but our co-op got $5 million, so it was a win-win in the end.'' Well, not quite. ''Now One57 blocks my view of Carnegie Hall.''
Bolstered by the recovery of the condominium market, with developers tripping over one another to build ever taller and more luxurious residential towers, air-rights deals are buzzing again, after having foundered along with the market in 2008.
That is why the Alexico Group, the developer in 2007 of a 57-story condominium tower at 56 Leonard Street designed by Herzog & de Meuron, agreed to pay New York Law School $150 million for the land and air rights to the site. When completed (construction had stalled during the recession), it will have extra bragging rights, as the tallest, and presumably the most luxurious, condominium in that neighborhood, with prices from $3 million to $35 million. Hines came on board as a co-developer of the project in September 2011.
For a new TriBeCa condominium development of somewhat less gargantuan proportions, the Warren Lofts, an 11-story building at 37 Warren Street, Sonny Bazbaz, the president of Bazbaz Development, found himself suddenly in need of an additional air and light easement.
Mr. Bazbaz bought the building, which was in foreclosure, for $15.5 million in 2011; his plan was to offer 14 apartments in the original seven-story loft building and four floor-through three-bedroom penthouses in an ultramodern four-story addition perched on the roof.
But when he approached the Department of Buildings about marketing his penthouses, he was informed that three of the four were ineligible as three-bedroom units because bedroom windows faced a lot line and could, technically, end up being blocked by a wall. So he needed more air rights, and fast.
''Three-bedroom apartments sell at a premium in TriBeCa,'' Mr. Bazbaz said, ''and besides, who really wants a two-bedroom penthouse? I had thought the previous transfer of T.D.R.'s from a building at 37 Murray included the light and air easement, but it turns out it hadn't.''
He went to 37 Murray with an offer of $80,000 and was rebuffed. ''They told me they wouldn't sign anything for less than a million dollars,'' he said. ''So I took a look at 41 Murray, which is adjacent to the rear of 37 Warren.''
End of story: he got the easement for $400,000 and an unexpected bonus. He was able to apply the easement to nine units that had bedroom windows facing 41 Murray, which agreed not to build taller and block them.
Mr. Shapiro of City Center Real Estate has negotiated both sides of air-rights transfers for nearly 50 years. ''It can be very much like playing three-card monte,'' he said. ''Air rights are like the tail wagging the dog, and to understand them, you've got to understand every nuance of New York City zoning.''
Air rights are generally worth nothing unless a developer wants to buy them. And apartment owners often don't own unused air rights; they are more likely controlled, if they exist, by the co-op or condo corporation that runs the building.
Robert I. Shapiro, an air-rights expert, has cautionary words for anyone who thinks he or she has excess air rights to sell: hire a real estate adviser. Supply and demand determine their worth, and transfers are complicated by a raft of zoning rules governing building height, density, setbacks and other technicalities. According to Joshua Stein, a real estate lawyer, it is usually the developer who approaches sellers after conducting a zoning analysis of potential supply sites. In some neighborhoods, height and density restrictions make significant air-rights transactions unlikely.
Invisible, Yet Buildable
Ross F. Moskowitz, a lawyer who specializes in land use and zoning cases, tells sellers never to part with 100 percent of their air rights, no matter how enticing the price.
''I always recommend to my clients that they keep some back, say 150 square feet or so,'' he said. ''You never know when you might need to make some adjustment to your building, but once you sell air rights, they're gone forever.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Vet Debt Trap

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
HAYLEY SCHAFER chose her dream job at the age of 5. Three years later, her grandmother told her that if she wrote it down, the dream would come true. So she found a piece of blue construction paper and scrawled on it with a pencil: ''Veterianian.'' ''No one told me how to spell it,'' she remembers. ''They just said, 'Sound it out.' ''
At the age of 30, she still has the sign, which is framed on her desk at the Caring Hearts Animal Clinic in Gilbert, Ariz., where she works as a vet. She also has $312,000 in student loans, courtesy of Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Or rather, $312,000 was what she owed the last time she could bring herself to log into the Sallie Mae account that tracks the ever-growing balance.
''It makes me sick, watching it increase,'' she says. ''There's also the stress of how am I going to save for retirement when I have this bear to pay off.'' 
They don't teach much at veterinary school about bears, particularly the figurative kind, although debt as large and scary as any grizzly shadows most vet school grads, usually for decades. Nor is there much in the curriculum about the prospects for graduates or the current state of the profession. Neither, say many professors and doctors, looks very promising. The problem is a boom in supply (that is, vets) and a decline in demand (namely, veterinary services). Class sizes have been rising at nearly every school, in some cases by as much as 20 percent in recent years. And the cost of vet school has far outpaced the rate of inflation. It has risen to a median of $63,000 a year for out-of-state tuition, fees and living expenses, according to the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, up 35 percent in the last decade.
This would seem less alarming if vets made more money. But starting salaries have sunk by about 13 percent during the same 10-year period, in inflation-adjusted terms, to $45,575 a year, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. America may be pet-crazed and filled with people eager to buy expensive fetch toys and heated cat beds. But the total population of pets is going down, along with the sums that owners are willing to spend on the health care of their animals, one of the lesser-known casualties of the recession.
Today, the ratio of debt to income for the average new vet is roughly double that of M.D.'s, according to Malcolm Getz, an economist at Vanderbilt University. To practitioners in the field, such numbers are ominous, and they portend lean times for new graduates.
''We're calling for more bodies coming through the veterinary educational pipeline at higher and higher cost at the very point in time that we need fewer and fewer,'' says Dr. Eden Myers, a vet in Mount Sterling, Ky., who runs the Web site JustVetData, where she crunches numbers about the profession. ''And they are going to get paid less and less.''
For years, the veterinary medical association contended that the United States needed more vets, not fewer, especially in rural areas. To support this view, in 2007, the organization helped underwrite a study, hoping to bolster a call for government assistance to help meet a putative shortfall of 15,000 vets by 2024.
The results, released last year, came to a strikingly different conclusion. Titled ''Assessing the Current and Future Workforce Needs in Veterinary Medicine'' and conducted under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, the study found little evidence of vet shortages. It also concluded that ''the cost of veterinary education is at a crisis point.''
The current president of the veterinary medical association, Dr. Douglas G. Aspros, isn't talking about unmet needs. Instead, he sounds like a man ready to rethink many of the premises his organization has long espoused.
''It's not a sustainable model,'' he says of vet school economics. ''For the long-term success and health of the veterinary practice, we've got to look at every end of it.''
That is a common sentiment among working vets, many of whom say the job market is the worst they have seen. But the deans of many vet schools see growth and opportunities, and one of them is Dr. Elaine Watson of Ross, the only profit-making vet school accredited by the veterinary medical association. Some vets and professors say the school, which is owned by DeVry Inc., a publicly traded educational company based in New Jersey, is a vivid example of all that has gone haywire for aspiring doctors of veterinary medicine, or D.V.M.'s, as they are known.
When you factor in cost of living and commuting costs, Ross is one of the more expensive places in the world to get a degree. And Ross mints D.V.M.'s at a remarkable clip. Last year, it graduated 287 of them -- triple the number of many American schools.
Dean Watson, not surprisingly, says focusing on the oversupply of vets is shortsighted. She says educators ought to think about how the field will look in 10 or 20 years. At any rate, she adds, students come to Ross with their eyes open. ''They've made the decision that they desperately want to be vets,'' she says, ''and they all realize that when they start taking on debt.''
ROSS is on the southern coast of St. Kitts, an island that once did a robust trade in sugar cane but today earns much of its money through tourism. The campus is a five-minute drive from the harbor town of Basseterre, where a cruise ship is often anchored. The hodgepodge of lecture halls and small labs are scattered around a grand, triangular-shaped outdoor amphitheater in front of the student union, with an unobstructed view of the sea.
One afternoon in January, Dr. Kathleen Yvorchuk was teaching a course called Introduction to Physical Exam. That day's lesson was the correct way to check a horse for a sinus infection. The trick is to knock on the bone that runs above a horse's muzzle -- knock hard, like that bone is a door -- and then listen.
''If they have a mass in their sinuses, it will sound dense and it thuds,'' Dr. Yvorchuk told a handful of students. A horse named Chocolate stood by, awaiting knocks. ''Please recognize, this is a large animal and you're not going to hurt it.''
The students took turns knocking on the forehead of Chocolate, who seemed impervious, as well as sinus-infection-free.
Students spend seven semesters at Ross, one after another, without summer breaks. This allows them to get through the program in less time, but to critics, Ross is a bit like a factory that is constantly building up production. This same criticism has also, in a milder form, been leveled at many of the 28 vet schools in the United States.
There are roughly 91,000 working vets in the country, about one-tenth the number of M.D.'s. But this relatively small universe is expanding rapidly. State budget cuts have led many domestic schools to make up lost revenue by adding students, in some cases by 10 percent in one year. Four more vet schools, both public and private, are either in the planning phases or under construction, one in New York, two in Arizona and one in Tennessee. If all are ultimately built, there will be thousands of additional D.V.M.'s on the market in coming years.
At the same time, the veterinary medical association's Council on Education has picked up the pace of its accreditation of foreign schools, like Ross on St. Kitts, giving its imprimatur to 10 of them since 2000. The goal, says Dr. Aspros, the association's president, is to make the United States the global standard setter for veterinary medicine. He defends this practice by noting that you don't need a diploma from a school accredited by the association to practice in the United States; graduates from unaccredited schools simply have to jump through a few additional hoops. But the association's seal of approval means students can qualify for certain federal loans. Because tuition at foreign schools is not subsidized by any states, graduates from places like Ross tend to wind up with larger-than-average debts.
And the level of debt for American graduates, says Dr. Alan M. Kelly, former dean of the veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania, who led the study on work force needs, is already too high. ''The general guideline is that your debt should never be twice your starting salary,'' Dr. Kelly says. ''The debt of graduates today, on average, is three times their starting salary. Well, this is a cataclysm.''
For Dr. Schafer, the burden of her student loan has dictated some crucial decisions, including where to live. After she graduated from Ross in 2011, she wanted to head home to San Diego, but she realized the city was too expensive, given her debts. She has a sister who lives in Scottsdale, so she settled on Arizona.
It took an intensive, monthlong search to find a job. Her technique was to walk unannounced into a clinic -- she eventually visited a couple of dozen -- and introduce herself to anyone who seemed to work there. She got lots of sympathetic smiles and heard many variations of ''We're not hiring.'' She finally found Caring Hearts through a help-wanted ad, and beat out 30 other applicants.
The job pays well -- $60,000, which is higher than the average starting salary for vets in this country. Her days now start at 7 a.m. and are booked until 7:30 p.m. with new-puppy exams, emergency surgeries and anything else that rolls in the door.
''There is no typical day,'' she says. ''I love the job.''
Her childhood mission to become a veterinarian was no whim. Soon after she made that sign, she started collecting animals on the 11-acre plot in the town outside San Diego where she grew up. Not just dogs, cats and a horse, but also chickens, fish and iguanas.
''My parents didn't know how to say no,'' she says, laughing. ''When I was 12, we went to buy some equipment for my horse, and I told the guy selling it that I was going to be a veterinarian. So he told my dad, 'You should buy her this pregnant goat.' Which he did.''
Today, her debt exceeds her salary by a factor of five -- much higher than the recommended twice-starting-salary ratio. She signed up for income-based repayment, a government program available to federal student loan recipients. (A newer program with slightly more generous terms, called Pay As You Earn, or PAYE, is available to more recent graduates.) Both income-based repayment and PAYE allow graduates to lead relatively normal lives by paying back a modest percentage of their income based on a formula. After a fixed amount of time, from 10 to 25 years, the balance of the debt is discharged.
That's the good news. The bad news is that the interest on the debt keeps growing and taxes must be paid on the amount discharged, as if it is income. Dr. Schafer sends $400 a month to Sallie Mae, a sum that will rise. But what kind of tax bill awaits her? Asked to run the numbers, GL Advisor, a financial services company that specializes in student loans, calculated that Dr. Schafer's debt is likely to exceed $650,000 when her tax bill lands 25 years after the start of the loan, which means she will owe the Internal Revenue Service roughly $200,000. That will happen while she is still deep in her career, perhaps around the time she wants to send some children to college.
''What I've done isn't a bright move,'' she says. ''But I can afford to eat. I bought a car. Nothing fancy, but functional.''
Dr. Schafer wound up with this huge debt because Ross was the only school to give her a come-hither after American schools refused her. She was twice turned down by the University of California, Davis, where she was an undergraduate, in large part, she says, because she received Bs as a freshman and sophomore. ''There were 120 openings and more than 1,000 applicants,'' she says. ''It's competitive.''
Getting admitted to Davis would have cut her tuition bills more than 50 percent. But she never balked at Ross's offer. Though Ross is rarely anyone's first choice, even detractors say its educational standards are high and its graduates are impressive. But the commuting costs, the foreign setting and the faint stigma that attends education at profit-making institutions have made it a school of last resort.
If getting in is easy, staying in is surprisingly hard. About 20 percent of Ross's first semester students won't make it to graduation, say administrators, an exceptionally high rate of attrition. (At American schools, it's typically closer to 2 percent.) About half of those students are bounced for poor academic performance. Dean Watson says most students flunk out early on, in the first and second semester. But some fail much later. In 2006, Diana Reyes was ejected in her sixth semester, leaving St. Kitts with $160,000 in debt and no degree.
''It was one of the saddest moments of my life,'' she says of the day she learned the news. She took a break, then borrowed more money to earn a technical degree from Purdue University. Today she earns $18 an hour as a technician in a veterinary clinic in Lafayette, Ind.
''My father is paying half of my loans,'' she says. ''I can't afford them myself.''
THE poor job market for new veterinarians is not the much-publicized fiasco that it is for new lawyers. But it's getting worse. For decades, new D.V.M.'s were snapped up by clinics and hospitals in the months before they graduated. In 2012, a mere 45 percent of graduating vets reported that they had accepted a permanent job offer -- as opposed to a time-limited and lower-paying internship, or a residency -- down from 84 percent in 1999. Last year, 39 percent of graduates had no job offers, up from 19 percent in 1999.
But after graduation, little data is collected about employment and salaries. Nobody knows the number of unemployed and underemployed vets. Vet-market optimists have long argued that many parts of the country are underserved. And if you look at a map of where vets set up practices, you will see large areas of the country with little or no coverage.
To address this problem, many states and the Department of Agriculture have offered loan-forgiveness programs, hoping to lure new graduates to places where vets are needed. Success stories are rare. Even with government assistance, it is hard to make it financially as a vet in areas that are both sparsely populated and poor.
Alisha Oehling, a 2009 graduate of Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, gave it a shot when she moved to Clarksville, Va. To qualify for loan forgiveness, she would have to spend 80 percent of her time treating cows and oxen. ''I took all the bovine work I could get, but it was just 25 percent of my practice,'' she says. ''There was no way to get to 80 percent.''
But even if she qualified for loan forgiveness, she says, it wouldn't have made much difference. During the winter, her phone often didn't ring for days at a time. During the spring, she once worked 42 days in a row. The feast-or-famine pace was trying enough, but even worse was that many of her clients, though devoted to their animals, often couldn't afford needed care.
''The average household income is about $26,000 a year,'' she says. ''If you have a backyard pony, you probably can't afford to spend $1,000 on it.''
So recently she moved. She beat out hundreds of vets who applied for a job at a clinic in Northern Virginia, where she will work mostly on high-priced horses, and where a vet can charge more, even for vaccines.
It's slowly dawning on leaders in the field that vet schools can't simply increase the number of graduates and expect them to move to underserved areas, hanging shingles where there currently are none.
The last refuge for rosy forecasters is the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report. It states that ''overall job opportunities for veterinarians are expected to be good.'' As Ross's public relations office points out, the report's data suggests that the country will need 22,000 new vets by 2020, far more than will be produced under the current system.
But many people believe that the bureau's report, which was written in 2009, is badly in need of an update. One of them is Henry Kasper, the economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who helped draft the report. There are others.
''We've gotten several calls from disgruntled vets who say, 'What is wrong with you guys? Are you completely blind? There is no demand for vet services,' '' says Mr. Kasper. ''This is pretty high on our list to really home in on the effects of the recession and see if there are long-term trends that have changed.'' Mr. Kasper said the full impact of the economic downturn had not yet hit when the bureau published its report. Also, the bureau looks at long-term trends, rather than short-term business cycles. Research at the time suggested, as Mr. Kasper put it, that ''people will always spend money on pets because they view them as part of the family.''
That belief has been tested. Not only are there fewer dogs -- from 2006 to 2011, the number of dogs in the country dropped for the first time, albeit slightly, to 70 million from 72 million, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association Sourcebook survey -- but the amount owners paid to vets fell, too. Owners reported they spent about $20 less a year in inflation-adjusted terms in that five-year span.
The declines are more significant when it comes to cats. About 36.1 million households owned at least one cat in 2011, down 6 percent from 2006. During that period, the number of cat visits to the vet declined 13.5 percent. In the business, this is known as ''the cat problem.''
The horse market has suffered the most. Pet horses are expensive, and the market for them since the start of the recession has been crushed. Thoroughbred racing, meanwhile, has been hurt by the expansion of casinos, reducing the number of horses in need of veterinary care.
''The estimates are that the horse population is down about 30 percent since 2008,'' says Dr. Stuart E. Brown of Hagyard Equine Medical Institute in Lexington, Ky. ''Traditionally we have hired five to seven new grads to our internship program. Lately, it's one or two.''
There is no simple solution to the problem of sinking salaries and rising debt, nor to the market saturation of vets, Dr. Aspros says. Tuition is expected to keep going up, class sizes are expected to grow and if new vet schools are built to the proper specifications, they will get the veterinary medical association's seal of approval.
An added wrinkle to the debate is gender. The number of women in vet schools has been rising for decades; today they account for 80 percent of graduates, flipping the gender mix on its head as compared to 30 years ago. As with most professions, there is a pay gap between men and women, and in the veterinary field it has widened since the downturn. Last year, starting salaries for women were 16 percent lower than for men, according to figures compiled by Dr. Myers of JustVetData, compared to a 3 percent difference in 2002. Everyone is losing ground, she says, but women are losing ground much faster than men.
''Still, when you go to meetings, almost every person in charge is an old white guy in a suit,'' she says. ''They want to find solutions as badly as anyone else, but we're like ships passing in the night.''
DISCUSSIONS about these and other vexing issues are conspicuously absent in most vet schools, say academics. Dr. James Wilson, a veterinarian, lawyer and professor who has taught at more than a dozen vet schools over the years, says he is consistently amazed at how little students know about their financial future.
Many schools do not seem eager to enlighten them. That includes Ross, where Dr. Wilson lectured for seven years, until early 2010. He was asked not to return, he says, soon after he persuaded the school to let him teach a personal finance class as part of the first-semester curriculum. (A Ross representative wrote in an e-mail that the school would not discuss personnel matters, but that ''Dr. Wilson's relationship with R.U.S.V.M. did not end for the reasons he's articulated to The New York Times.'')
The class, he said, had left many students with an existential case of sticker shock. ''By the end of each of these sessions,'' Dr. Wilson says, ''I witnessed much fear and considerable depression. More than once, I saw tears.''
''I have said it over and over to myself and friends, 'This is as close to predatory lending as anything I've ever seen,' '' Dr. Wilson continues. ''The only reason it's not a high-profile crime in 2013 is because income-based repayment and pay as you earn have postponed the reality and pain for 20 to 30 years.''
What Dr. Wilson learned long ago is that it is hard to talk anyone out of vet school. Many students, like Dr. Schafer, set their hearts on the job at an early age. If you are doing what you have always wanted, and you find it fulfilling, the numbers don't seem relevant. At least initially.
''It comes down to this,'' Dr. Schafer says. ''Is there anything else I'd be happy doing? No. Is there any way around paying off the loans? No. So, what the heck? A lot of it is just trying to put it out of your mind and maybe it'll disappear.''
She realizes that this is crazy. The bear that is her tuition bill has an appointment in about 23 years, and that is the one beast she doesn't know how to treat.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 3, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the financial challenges facing the veterinary profession referred incorrectly to the federal tax treatment of forgiven debt for veterinary students. It is treated as income, not as a gift. The article also referred incorrectly to conditions under which foreign veterinary schools can have their students qualify for United States federal loans. Although a school's accreditation by the Council on Education of the American Veterinary Medical Association is needed for some loans, it is not required for all types. The article also misstated the name of the town where Alisha Oehling, a 2009 graduate of Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, once practiced. It is Clarksville, Va., not Sparksville.
A chart with the article, showing trends in the profession, reversed the labels in a line graph. The bottom line was for the number of pet dogs and cats in the United States, and the top line for the number of visits to veterinarians. And another line graph in the chart mislabeled veterinary pay figures. The graph showed the average starting pay for veterinarians, not average overall pay in the profession. A corrected chart can be found at nytimes.com/businessday.

HEADLINE: Not Your Average Hostels

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE AJUDUA

 BODY:
Grupo Habita, the Mexico City-based team behind the upscale Hôtel Americano in New York, is known for taking an unconventional approach to hospitality. Still, its latest property -- Downtown Mexico, a hotel within a 17th-century palace in the Centro Histórico district of Mexico City -- houses a bit of a surprise: the company's first hostel, Downtown Beds.
Downtown Beds occupies the palace's former service quarters. ''The space had the bones for a youthful project,'' said Carlos Couturier, managing partner at Grupo Habita, which created an upscale hotel at the opposite end of the building. ''There was an intimate patio and a rooftop that could be transformed into something cool.'' The local architecture firm Cherem Serrano kept the original Catalan vaulted ceilings, painted the wooden floors white and installed up to eight bespoke lattice-brick bunks in each room, as well as en-suite bathrooms with rain showers. The patio is now a ''chela'' garden (that's slang for beer) and the rooftop has a swimming pool and bar that draws a steady stream of locals. There's also a kitchen serving Mexican street snacks, a screening room, table tennis, foosball and free use of bikes. 
''People don't come to Downtown Beds because it's cheap; we have had guests pay with Amex black cards,'' said Mr. Couturier, whose company also plans to open a hostel in Mazunte, Oaxaca, in two years. ''They come because it's fun and different.''
Clearly, Downtown Beds is not your traditional hostel, nor could its guests be defined as typical backpackers. There are no chores required, no lockout hours or curfews, and linens and toiletries are provided in each of the 17 rooms, whether private or shared. It is one of the latest examples of a global, industrywide trend focused on accommodating design-conscious 20- and 30-somethings who are seeking out the scene (via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) for reasons beyond saving a buck.
''We're seeing more and more travelers who can afford to stay at hotels, yet choose to stay at hostels for the social experience,'' said Aaron Chaffee, director of hostels at Hostelling International USA, who noted that many modern hostels are offering the same amenities as hotels: private rooms, concierge service, Wi-Fi, restaurants and bars. And, of course, stylish interiors.
According to Mr. Chaffee, the trend has its roots in Asia, known for its capsule hotels, and Europe, largely considered the vanguard of hosteling. There is, for example, Matchbox, which opened near Singapore's Chinatown in 2011. It calls itself a ''concept hostel.'' Think breakfast all day (Indian rojak or Malay cookies) and pod-style bunks with panels that open and close, in case you'd like to chat with your neighbor.
Meanwhile, outside Munich, the German Youth Hostel Association has tapped the Laboratory for Visionary Architecture, also known as LAVA, an eco-conscious local firm, to transform the circa-1930 Berchtesgaden Youth Hostel. ''We were commissioned to rethink what a hostel could be in the age of boutique hotels,'' said the LAVA director Tobias Wallisser. The first section reopened just over a year ago with natural-wood ''cocoon'' bunks, energy-efficient wood pellet heating and cantilevered window nooks affording views of the Bavarian Alps, where a resident outfitter arranges mountain biking and ski trips; the next phase, with a bistro and lounge, is set to be completed by 2015, along with LAVA's second hostel, in Bayreuth.
And in Reykjavik, a group of former soccer player and filmmaker friends recently turned a disused biscuit factory -- originally scouted by the Icelandic director Oskar Thor Axelsson for his movie ''Black's Game'' -- into Kex Hostel. With a retro barbershop, a gastropub and a music venue-slash-art gallery that stages events from the likes of Sigur Ros (or Russell Crowe and Patti Smith, who recently gave an impromptu performance), it has a cult following among travelers and locals.
Increasingly, the hostel is being reinvented abroad -- in places like South America. Inspired by his backpacking trips around the world, 28-year-old Guilherme Perez left a career in banking to create the old-meets-new, minimalist-chic We Hostel Design back home in São Paulo, Brazil. After finding the location -- a whitewashed, early-20th-century mansion in the Vila Mariana neighborhood -- Mr. Perez asked the architect Felipe Hess to design the seven dorm rooms, two private rooms and multiple common spaces (including a ''glass room'' with wraparound windows and a low slate roof, where guests are invited to leave their mark in chalk) with a black-and-white color scheme. The hostel's creative director, the 26-year-old user-experience designer Rodrigo Marangoni, embedded the space with smartphone-compatible QR codes, allowing guests to download everything from subway maps to, say, a song by the São Paulo rapper Criolo.
We Hostel Design is a family-financed project. However, ''investors are starting to realize that there is money to be made in this business,'' said David Chapman, director general of the Amsterdam-based World Youth Student and Educational Travel Confederation. According to the latest international hosteling survey -- which was produced by STAY WYSE, the accommodation sector of the World Youth Student and Educational (WYSE) Travel Confederation, in collaboration with Hostelling International, Hostelworld.com, HostelBookers.com and others -- the industry is now valued at $34 billion, with the global economic downturn acting as a boon.
That said, the profitability of hostels has gone largely unnoticed -- until now. ''There's been an influx of high-profile brands in the market,'' said Mr. Chapman, ''with hostels that are challenging two- and three-star hotels. The difference between these two options is basically the letter 's.' It stands for 'social.' ''
The United States has been rather resistant to hosteling, though a number of hoteliers have started experimenting. Last year, in South Lake Tahoe, Calif., the former Joie de Vivre executive Christian Strobel opened the adventure-friendly Basecamp with amenities (communal dinners, fire pits, a rooftop hot tub) meant to encourage guest interaction. Its 50 rooms are all private, but some have bright orange bunk beds and sleep up to eight. More recently, the ''straight-friendly urban resort,'' Out NYC, opened eight hostel-style Sleep Share rooms featuring roomy bunks with personal TVs and privacy curtains; access to the hotel's nightclub, spa and 24-hour gym is included.
In Florida, the Sydell Group, which runs the Nomad Hotel in New York, describes its latest property -- Freehand Miami -- as ''the first upscale hostel in the U.S.'' It opened last December in an Art Deco building a short stroll from the luxury hotels lining South Beach, with 239 beds divided among 63 rooms.
''We wanted a happy, summer camp vibe,'' said Robin Standefer of Roman & Williams, the New York-based design firm responsible for the hostel's boho-chic interiors (not to mention Manhattan's Ace Hotel). The wooden bunks have Mexican blankets, bolster pillows, linen shutters and built-in nightstands with reading lights and power outlets so you can recharge your smartphone while you sleep. Staff members wear T-shirts by the emerging American fashion duo Timo Weiland, custom beach cruisers are available for rent, and the bar, in an overgrown tropical garden with mismatched vintage furnishings and a swimming pool, is a favorite among Miami's hipster set. Bartenders mix cocktails ($11) using herbs grown on site; there are $3 Miller High Lifes and bottles of Krug for $350 a pop.
''People are generally putting up hotels that have some sort of lifestyle or design element,'' said the Sydell Group founder and chief executive Andrew Zobler. ''It was only natural that would happen in the hostel space, but it really hadn't reached the U.S.''
For many travelers, though, a hostel is just a cheap place to crash; in this country, the word tends to connote an environment akin to its pronunciation. Set on changing that perception, the Sydell Group plans to open Freehand locations nationwide (next up: New York). Still, designer uniforms and Champagne aside, there is something to be said for the romance of roughing it -- the journey, not the lodging being the point. If you ask Mr. Chaffee, ''a hostel is only well designed if it supports what it was designed to do: provide a social space for travelers to meet up, go out and explore the location and then return to reflect on the experiences of the day.''
Farryn Weiner, a 27-year-old New Yorker, is one such traveler. Whether for work (as the global director of digital and social media for Michael Kors) or pleasure, she is on the road about 10 days a month, stopping anywhere from a business hotel in Tokyo to a tented camp at Coachella. Recently, Ms. Weiner booked a bed in one of Freehand's ''quad'' rooms. ''It was like a mix of a hostel and a boutique hotel,'' she said. ''Everyone was sharing tips on where they were going and what they were doing; I walked away with all sorts of connections. For me, at this moment in my life, that's worth more than a five-star spa.''

HEADLINE: As Oscars Fever Builds, Some Chinese Ask: 'What About Our Films?'

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: An annual prediction of Oscars winners by the actress Zhang Ziyi is drawing attention here as Oscars fever grows, and some mourn Chinese films aren&#8217;t present. They&#8217;re just not good enough, many say. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - As Oscar fever grows around the world with the 85th Academy Awards set to begin in Los Angeles just hours from now, excitement is building in China, even though it has no films in competition. There is also a sense of frustration here about why China's movies aren't nominated for the world's biggest awards? 
China sees itself as advancing in many ways, growing richer and more powerful, so its inability to come up with serious Oscars contenders rankles. 
The most popular answer to the question, held by ordinary Chinese and film experts alike, is: "Too few good films. That's the real reason in recent years Chinese films have moved further and further away from the Oscars dream," wrote The International Herald Leader newspaper, in a story carried on the country's popular Tencent entertainment site.
An article by The Economic Daily, carried on People's Daily Web site, gave another interpretation: "The Oscars have never been a communal forum, the films taken seriously have only the responsibility to portray the North American world view and the lives they're willing to see."
As I've explored elsewhere, strict censorship hobbles the Chinese film industry. Directors are increasingly voicing their frustration in public, yet there's little they can do against the directives of the state. One result of this hamstringing of talent is it's virtually impossible to make probing films about contemporary society, which has many social tensions the government doesn't want openly explored. Instead, filmmakers retreat to the safety of historical themes, with tales of warring dynasties commonplace. 
Also, strict import rules governing overseas movies mean few may be shown here. As a person with the handle LA-YIN wrote on Sina Weibo, the microblog: "With the exception of Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi,' none of the nominated films has screened in China."
Much attention is being focused on a prediction of winners in an annual list drawn up by the actress Zhang Ziyi. Ms. Zhang starred in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," a hit in 2000 by the Taiwanese director Ang Lee. She is also the first Chinese star from the People's Republic of China to be listed on the jury for the Oscars, in 2005, Xinhua, the state news agency, reported. 
Many netizens are pointing out that Ms. Zhang's list runs at an estimated 90 percent accuracy rate. So what's she tapping? 
Best Director? Mr. Lee and Steven Spielberg ("Lincoln") are in tight competition, she writes. "Emotionally, I'm drawn to Ang Lee. Intellectually I'm drawn to Spielberg. These are the two films I've liked most this year."
Best Film? "Lincoln. Whether you like the movie or not, it gives off glamor and radiance. I salute Spielberg's youthfulness," she wrote.
China is 16 hours ahead of Los Angeles, so watching will be tricky for people headed into a normal working day on Monday. As -Mostro- wrote on a microblog site, "It's the Oscars today!!!!!!! But it'll only be on tomorrow, Beijing time ....I can't watch it," followed by four yellow, grimacing emoticons.

HEADLINE: Debt, Spreads, and Mysterious Omissions

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The euro makes all the difference. 

 BODY:
Binyamin Applebaum reports on a new paper by Greenlaw et al alleging that bad things will happen to America, because debt over 80 percent of GDP leads to high interest rates, and is skeptical - but not skeptical enough. I found the paper amazing, and not in a good way. 
As Applebaum says, Japan poses a big problem for this kind of analysis. So the question is whether Japan is a special case. The argument that it isn't revolves around the suggestion that what really matters is borrowing in your own currency - in which case the US and the UK are, in terms of borrowing costs, like Japan rather than Greece. That's certainly what the De Grauwe (pdf) analysis suggests.
Even the quickest look at the data suggests that there's something to this argument; for example, taking data from the paper itself, and dividing the countries into euro and non-euro, we get a scatterplot like this:
It's not just Japan, off at the far right, that looks different; Canada, the UK and the US, the three red squares along the middle bottom, also seem to have borrowing costs well below what euro-area experience might have suggested. 
Furthermore, the experience since mid-2012, in which the ECB drove spreads down sharply after it signaled its willingness to head off self-fulfilling liquidity crises - which can't happen to countries with their own currencies - also suggests that the own-currency issue is crucial.
So how do Greenlaw et al respond to this issue? Well, they don't - not at all. They don't even cite De Grauwe. So as far as I can tell this paper isn't helpful at all; it ignores the key question in the whole debate.

HEADLINE: Governors Issue Warning on Impact of Cuts

BYLINE: RAYMOND HERNANDEZ


HIGHLIGHT: Governors in both parties warned of the potentially damaging consequences across the country if President Obama and Congress do not agree on a plan to avoid across-the-board spending cuts that are scheduled to take effect beginning on Friday. 

 BODY:
Governors in both parties warned on Sunday of the potentially damaging consequences across the country if President Obama and Congress do not agree on a plan to avoid across-the-board spending cuts that are scheduled to take effect beginning on Friday. 
With the prospect of a last-minute agreement in Washington increasingly unlikely, the governors said the scheduled cuts would have a grave impact in a wide range of areas, including the military, Border Patrol and job growth.
"The effects will be significant, and people will feel them," Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
"There's been so much uncertainty," said Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, who also appeared on the program. "It's really going to hurt our economy."
On Friday, $85 billion in cuts will automatically begin taking effect, with many domestic programs facing reductions of as much as 9 percent and military programs being reduced by 13 percent over the rest of the federal fiscal year.
Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress have been hoping that the threat of drastic automatic cuts - particularly those to the Pentagon - would force Republicans to the bargaining table and lead them to accept a compromise that included a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.
But as of late last week, Republicans made it clear that they would not accept any additional increase in taxes to avoid the scheduled cuts, known as the sequester. Many Republicans believe their party already relented significantly when they agreed on New Year's Eve to $600 million in tax increases to end the last budget standoff.
On Sunday, some governors held out hope that the president and Congress could still get a deal even at this late stage. But they also insisted that the nation would be hit hard if the cuts were allowed to go into effect.
Appearing on "Face the Nation," Gov. Martin O'Malleyof Maryland described the sequester cuts as a threat to the economy and seemed to advocate Mr. Obama's notion of a "balanced approach" that mixed spending cuts and tax increases.
"These are job killing cuts," he said. "We cannot cut our way to prosperity."
Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia said that while cuts in government spending were necessary, he expressed concern that the automatic cuts would fall too heavily on the military.
Mr. McDonnell, speaking on "Face the Nation," faulted Mr. Obama, suggesting he was using the threat of cuts to exact concessions from Republicans. "I think the president is overplaying his hand in order to get people to raise taxes," he said.

HEADLINE: The Forgotten Emancipationists

BYLINE: MANISHA SINHA


HIGHLIGHT: Recent popular history has overlooked the critical role of abolitionists in ending slavery. 

 BODY:
On the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, discussion over who freed the slaves, fueled by movies like "Lincoln," have become commonplace. While historians have debated the relative roles of Abraham Lincoln and the slaves themselves in the coming of emancipation, few have paid attention to the abolitionists, the forgotten emancipationists in the story of black freedom. 
Actually, they're hidden in plain sight, even in contemporary emancipation narratives. In Steven Spielberg's "Lincoln," which may well win the Academy Award for Best Picture this evening, they are represented by the lone figure of the Radical Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens. In Quentin Tarantino's fictional western on slavery, "Django Unchained," perhaps by the articulate German bounty hunter posing as a dentist (Christoph Waltz's character isn't pure fantasy; many "Forty Eighters," refugees from the failed 1848 revolution in the German states, were political radicals and staunchly antislavery). In fact, the idea of a Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery, the subject of Lincoln, originated with abolitionists. 
The problem with movies like "Lincoln" is not that they depict passive black characters - in fact most black characters in the movie are drawn in a nuanced fashion - but that nearly all characters in the movie, including Lincoln himself, are devoid of their proper historical context, particularly the abolitionists and the even larger political antislavery movements. Emancipation was not simply a presidential and congressional game; it was the long and hard-won result of decades of black and white activism before and during the war. 
But the abolition movement is rarely the focus of popular depictions on emancipation. Radical "fanatics," abolitionists do not fit into mainstream, Whiggish depictions of the progress of liberty in United States history. Nor do their severe castigations of the slaveholding republic conform to the conservative ideal of American "exceptionalism." 
The three-part series on the abolitionists airing on PBS (to which I, among other historians, contributed as a "talking head") seeks to correct this neglect. Yet even while the series does a generally admirable job of rescuing at least the individuals it showcases from historical obscurity, the full and complex story of the abolition movement that advocated emancipation for years before the Civil War has yet to be told. 
The roots of the abolition movement lay in the revolutionary era, when outstanding individual abolitionists in Philadelphia like the Quaker school teacher Anthony Benezet and Richard Allen, the former slave who founded the African Methodist Episcopal church, along with newly formed abolition societies and newly emancipated black communities, worked to end the slave trade and slavery. During the American Revolution, African-Americans fought on both sides, ran away and petitioned to gain their freedom, and many abandoned the land of their enslavement. The first wave of antislavery would end with the abolition of the African slave trade by Britain and the United States in 1808 and the gradual emancipation laws of the North. Instead of withering and dying away, as some had hoped it would, Southern slavery expanded and became entrenched in the nation's economy and its political institutions, even as black freedom in the North fell far short of equality. It would once again be up to the abolitionists to break the national complicity on slavery and racism.
During the early part of the 19th century, Northern free blacks helped launch the antebellum abolition movement and determine its program of emancipation and black citizenship in the United States. In rejecting all forms of antislavery severely tainted by racism, including the original Jeffersonian plan to "colonize" African-Americans out of the country, abolitionists did not embrace fanaticism but racial egalitarianism. When William Lloyd Garrison started publishing The Liberator in 1831, he had a keen appreciation of black abolitionists like David Walker, who had preceded him and whose anti-colonization program and radical rhetoric he adopted. African-Americans sustained Garrison's brand of immediate, uncompensated abolition and his newspaper, forming two-thirds of its subscribers and contributing generously to keep it afloat. They were the first abolitionists.
Few people today appreciate the extent to which grass-roots black activism, enslaved and free, lay at the heart of the abolition movement. Building on Quaker precedent, black abolitionists like David Ruggles and William Still gave organizational form to the abolitionist rebellion against the fugitive slave laws that led to rendition of runaways and wholesale kidnapping of free blacks into slavery. 
In the 1840s and 1850s, scores of slave runaways like Frederick Douglass breathed new life into a fractured movement, divided between Garrisonians and evangelical and political abolitionists. They gave the abolitionists their most potent issue, the fugitive slave controversy. Charles Sumner, the Radical Republican senator from Massachusetts featured in a ridiculous cameo in "Lincoln," called them the "heroes of our age." 
The resistance of runaway slaves had repercussions that resonated in the halls of Congress and Northern state and courthouses, and fugitive slave narratives long preceded Harriet Beecher Stowe's best-selling antislavery novel "Uncle Tom's Cabin." These "freedom seekers" were the forerunners of the slaves who sought freedom in Union Army lines and who with their abolitionist allies pushed the Lincoln administration to move on emancipation during the Civil War. 
Their real-life stories are far more compelling than the seductively gratifying fantasy of slave resistance depicted by a lone slave gunman in "Django Unchained." To give Tarantino his due, the vengeful violence unleashed by Django evokes Nat Turner's no-quarter-given rebellion. But even Turner had at least 50 to 60 followers and perhaps many more sympathizers. And slave rebels like Turner, Cinque, Madison Washington and above all the participants in the Haitian Revolution continued to exercise a powerful influence on the abolitionist imagination. This was true not just of black abolitionists but also of pacifist Garrisonians and the more conservative evangelicals led by Lewis Tappan of New York. 
Abolitionists critiqued not just Southern slavery but also Northern racism, which became increasingly ubiquitous in intellectual circles and popular culture in the years before the Civil War, acting as a powerful argument against emancipation. Black abolitionists in particular opposed federal and Northern state laws that discriminated against free African-Americans. 
Despite what some scholars have dubbed the "romantic racialism" of some white abolitionists, all factions of the abolition movement would share this programmatic commitment to black civic and political equality. Indeed the problem that abolitionists confronted was the fundamental failure of a majority in the country to imagine African-Americans as fellow citizens of the American republic. Abolitionists are often accused of not developing a full-fledged program for emancipation, since they opposed compensation for slaveholders and long periods of "apprenticeship," a euphemism for new forms of servitude, for emancipated slaves. 
But the attempt during the years following the Civil War to base Reconstruction on black citizenship, which was codified in the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, had abolitionist origins. Some now argue that citizenship was not enough, but the fact remains that even that minimal abolitionist demand was not met until the civil rights movement a hundred years later. And many abolitionists proved to be more radical, demanding the redistribution of land among former slaves and advocating for labor rights.
Abolitionism would also inspire the struggle for "woman's rights" as women fought for equality both within and outside the movement. One of the first American women to speak out in public for "African liberty" was the black female abolitionist Maria Stewart. (The abolitionist feminist and labor-rights spokeswoman Francis Wright had preceded her in the United States, but she was British.) As another activist, Angelina Grimke, put it, "In striving to strike the slave's chains off, we found most surely, that we were chained ourselves." 
Nor was female abolitionism a purely white woman's domain, as is the common misperception. The first female antislavery society, founded in 1832, was an all-black group in Salem, Mass., which would later start admitting white women into its ranks. Women's rights would prove to be a bone of contention among abolitionists, as evangelical abolitionists parted company with the Garrisonians on this issue. In turn, some predominantly white suffragists, led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, would split with abolitionists and most African-Americans over the Reconstruction amendments to the Constitution that excluded women. Still, it was the Garrisonian commitment to citizenship regardless of race and gender that had given birth to their movement; the American women's movement became more autonomous after the war but it also lost the abolitionist commitment to racial equality.
Abolitionist advocacy of black citizenship, as well as the movement's inclusion of African-Americans and women, incited "gentlemen of property and standing" to launch a long campaign of harassment against it. Mob violence and censorship married the cause of abolition with that of civil liberties and republican government. 
By the eve of the Civil War, hundreds of thousands men and women, primarily from the Northern states, had joined the abolition movement, and nearly two million abolitionists and fellow travelers signed petitions against slavery and the domestic slave trade. And they waded into politics, too: even as the Garrisonians rejected what they increasingly viewed as the essentially proslavery nature of the American state and church, many more would vote for the abolitionist Liberty Party and the Free Soil party. 
Ironically, as abolitionists divided over politics, religion and women's rights, antislavery would become more popular in the North. While abolitionists remained a minority, large numbers of Northern citizens came to oppose the western expansion of slavery in the aftermath of the Mexican War and the 1854 Kansas Nebraska Act. The antislavery majority in the North that elected Abraham Lincoln to the presidency on the Republican platform of the non-extension of slavery in 1860 was the product of at least three decades of abolitionist agitation to overturn the proslavery consensus. 
"In order to form a more perfect Union, they tore the nation apart," reads the blurb advertising the PBS abolition series. But abolitionists, even John Brown, did not start the Civil War. Southern states, which refused to abide by the results of a presidential election, seceded from the Union and fired the first shot on Fort Sumter, did. Abolitionists may have expected violence, but they didn't seek it. In the end, we can blame the abolitionists for emancipation but not the carnage.

HEADLINE: Nigeria Abuzz Over Who Paid for Beyoncé Concert

BYLINE: FRANKIE EDOZIEN


HIGHLIGHT: Increasing anger in Nigeria as President Goodluck Jonathan comes under fire for spending money on public relations and lobbying. 

 BODY:
[Video: Beyoncé performed in Nigeria in 2006 Watch on Youtube.]
Did the Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, divert $1 million from an anti-poverty program to finance a trip to Lagos by American pop stars Beyoncé Knowles and her husband Jay-Z?
Documents unearthed by the intrepid journalists at Sahara Reporters and released recently seem to indicate that he did. 
And they have sparked an angry debate among Nigerians.
The gist of the matter is that in 2006 as governor of the oil-producing Bayelsa state, Mr. Jonathan robbed the very poor in his state to help pay the very rich Americans, to burnish Nigeria's image abroad. 
There is no indication that Beyoncé and Jay Z, who thrilled crowds in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, knew that their visit could have been paid for, in part, by funds designated to ending abject poverty. 
But when she performed this rendition of Nigeria's national anthem, photos of Bayelsa state appeared on the screens behind her. You can see her thrill the audience above and here, singing live as it were.
This news came on the heels of reality star Kim Kardashian flying into Lagos for a Valentine's Day event she "co-hosted" for a reported $500,000. 
Her entire contribution was a brief appearance and a two-word greeting to the well-heeled crowd: "Hey Naija," slang for "Hey, Nigeria. She took off immediately after. Folks are wondering where the money to fund her appearance came from.
While many Nigerians are outraged, Mr. Jonathan's administration has remained mum on the issue. But Nigerian press accounts revealed this month that in recent years, the administration paid up to $60,000 to contract a American public relations and lobbying powerhouse. 
As president, Mr. Jonathan has worked hard to try to burnish Nigeria's image abroad, even as millions of Nigerians remain mired in poverty in his home state and the country at large. 
Sahara Reporters points out that "according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, 47 percent of Bayelsans live in poverty. The World Bank says that per capita gross domestic product in the Niger Delta is significantly below the country's average. According to the state's own 2005 development strategy, 80 percent of rural communities have no access to safe drinking water."
Mr. Jonathan's efforts - even his successful ones - are not always impressive. The January interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour from Davos, below and here, was not widely seen as one of his finer moments. 
[Video: Watch on Youtube.]
The Beyoncé concert was organized by Ndukka Obaigbena, a publisher whose efforts to wrangle money from government entities for his jamborees, as well as his high-profile media portrayals abroad have been called into question. 
More importantly, the image of Nigeria as a haven for poverty and corruption on the continent - and terrorists - doesn't appear to be on the verge of changing soon, as Britain sends bombers to Nigeria and the Obama administration sends drones next door.
But maybe through film, and soft power Nigeria can be rebranded. On Friday, on the eve of the Academy Awards, for the first time a Nigerian film from the country's Nollywood industry was released in U.S. movie theaters.

HEADLINE: Less Innovation, More Inequality

BYLINE: EDMUND S. PHELPS


HIGHLIGHT: America&#8217;s peak years of indigenous innovation ran from the 1820s to the 1960s. A slowdown in dynamism since then has contributed to soaring inequality. 

 BODY:
ONE source of the outsize inequalities in America is the dynamism that made economic activity so rewarding. An economy open to new concepts and novel ventures is bound to generate unequal gains. To tax all of those gains would close off the prospects for success that many entrepreneurs need if they are to undertake ambitious ventures - a big mistake. But it would also be a mistake to misunderstand the relation of inequality and innovation. It is less innovation - not more - that has widened inequality in the United States in recent decades.

America's peak years of indigenous innovation ran from the 1820s to the 1960s. There were a few financial panics and two depressions, to be sure. But in this period, a frenzy of creative activity, economic competition and rapid growth in national income provided widening economic inclusion, rising wages for all and engaging careers for most. Innovations gave workers better tools to work with and better products to make, thus lifting their wages. Then this innovation began to retreat, most of it to an area of land along the West Coast. In the early 1970s the rate of indigenous innovation (as measured by its estimated contribution to the rate of growth in labor productivity) dropped by about half - to around 1 percent since then, from about 2 percent before then. 
The economist Robert J. Gordon has noted this slowdown in innovation, which he lays to the end of big breakthroughs. My view is that innovation has declined in the everyday processes that businesses tinker with incrementally as they try to become more productive over time. This decline of innovation across many fields - with notable exceptions like Silicon Valley, biotechnology and clean energy - has set back much of the earlier gains in productivity in American history.
It forced a broad devaluation of business assets, including employees. Wage restraint and reduced hiring followed, especially in the heavy manufacture of capital goods. As a result, wages of workers on the low rungs of the ladder slowed more than the wages of those in the middle, and the rising gap leveled off only in the 1990s. Unemployment rates tend to rise and fall in roughly equal proportion at all rungs of the ladder, and that happened between 1973 and 1985. (Over that time, the rate for white men went from 4.3 to 6.2 percent, for black men from 9.4 to 15.1 percent.) But the rise in unemployment was of greater consequence to those on the bottom rung, since their economic precariousness had been higher to start with. This is the heart of the inequality story.
The gap between the less advantaged and the more advantaged widened as the gap between high-school graduates and dropouts and Americans with college and graduate degrees rose. Many of the more advantaged could opt to retire on their resources, which fewer of the less advantaged could do. No wonder that between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, the labor force participation rate of white men - who were already relatively advantaged - drifted down while, in contrast, the participation rates of black and Latino men did not. (The rise of female participation rates, white and nonwhite, is another story.)
The inequality gaining attention recently is different in scale but not kind. In my 1997 book "Rewarding Work: How to Restore Participation and Self-Support to Free Enterprise," I wrote that wages had declined in the middle of the income distribution - "approximately at the border between the working class and the middle class" - relative to the affluent.
In short, there has been a widening between the middle and the top in both employment and wages. This "decompression," as some economists call it, began swelling with the return, around 2004, of the meager innovation and slow growth that had plagued the economy since the 1970s until the brief respite offered by the Internet boom that began in the mid-1990s.
The question that confronts policy makers is what steps to take.
There has been a drumbeat for investment in infrastructure. Advocates in business and government assert that such projects would create more work while they last and leave productivity higher in the end - though maybe not high enough to earn the revenue to cover the cost. The impact on jobs is clear over the short run. Economists have been sifting data for evidence that cities and states have won measurable gains in productivity from their capital projects. Whatever the answer, the debate has missed the point that the government will have to keep on finding new projects as old ones are completed. Such an endless series of projects will run into the law of diminishing returns. And even if returns hold up, bricks and mortar are not a solution to the decline in dynamism that - largely if not wholly - lies behind the slowdown in innovation.
Two ideas about how to revive the nation's dynamism are much in discussion.
Some observers attribute the bulk of the American economy's innovation - new products and new methods - to commercial applications of recent scientific advances. This pool of scientific advances, the argument goes, has pretty much run dry, with little replenishment in recent years, and so American innovation has run out of fuel. These scientists then say that stepping up government funding for scientific research could refill the pool, creating new possibilities for innovation into the indefinite future.
But this thesis is based on a mistaken premise. There is no evidence that innovating in America is or has been tethered to scientific advances. Some historians find that innovations largely ran ahead of scientific advances in the 19th century. The myriad new products of recent decades were mostly created by new commercial ideas and tinkering, not by new scientific advances.
A second approach, advocated by some economists and policy makers, is the explicit adoption of an industrial policy. It is argued that the government can spark innovation in the private sector by providing finance for development and marketing of new products or methods in companies or industries that offer promise, at least in the government's view, of boosting innovation. President Obama has implicitly endorsed such an approach. In his State of the Union address last month, he vowed to make America "a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing," favorably cited a "manufacturing innovation institute" in Youngstown, Ohio, that engages in 3-D printing, and announced the start of three more such manufacturing hubs, which will work with the Defense and Energy Departments "to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs."
But this thesis that the government can adequately make the decisions once made by a well-functioning private sector raises serious doubts. Granted, enterprises in the private sector are prone to making mistakes when deciding to develop new products - since feasibility, cost and market reception are all unknown. The difficulty with a national industrial policy is that it places those decisions in the hands of government officials who are remote from the local expertise and insights that companies draw on for dynamic innovation. It is hard enough for venture capitalists and early-stage investors to make the right choices. It is unimaginable that the government can do it well. Besides, there is a moral hazard. Operating an industrial policy runs the risk that government officials - perhaps unconsciously - will do what is best for their political prospects rather than what they might agree was best if they were not directly involved.
What, then, can be done to address the slowdown in innovation and the attendant rise in inequality? There is no question that effective initiatives can be taken to address particular inequalities. Subsidies for employers to hire low-wage workers is one initiative that could be taken to address a particularly serious inequality. But there is no way to restore the sense of equality that prevailed as late as the 1960s without remedying the ills that caused inequalities to widen: the narrowing of high innovation to a handful of industries and the consequent slowing of economic growth to a snail's pace.
I am convinced that a return to the productivity growth and broad economic inclusion of the past will require nothing less than a revival of the high dynamism that underpinned that performance.
The needed revival will require a reform of the financial sector and of the business sector. In the financial sector it is necessary to put an end to the short-term thinking that unduly focuses on hitting quarterly earnings targets instead of aiming for long-range profitability and growth. Financial institutions' addiction to liquidity has made lending to business less attractive, while an addiction to diversified investments has left very few financial institutions willing to make money the old-fashioned way - by lending, or investing in projects for new products and methods.
In the business sector, it is necessary to put an end to infighting in established companies and the shortsightedness of chief executives who know they have only a few years in which to haul in some big bonuses. Better corporate oversight by boards and by government regulators is also essential.
Little of this will happen, however, and any government reforms will be undermined without a wider embrace of the old ethos of imagination, exploration, experiment and discovery. It is that ethos that laid the foundation for the broad-based prosperity of the American middle class in the postwar years, and without its revival, no amount of government intervention can fully mitigate the widening inequality that the slowdown in innovation has helped create.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Dismiss China's Denials Over Cyberattacks

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: In some of his strongest public remarks about the reported Chinese-sponsored cyber attacks on American companies and government agencies, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said that the situation was &#8220;as bad as I&#8217;ve ever seen it and exponentially getting worse.&#8221; 

 BODY:
In some of his strongest public remarks yet about the cyberattacks on American companies and government agencies that are believed to have been sponsored by China, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday that the situation was "as bad as I've ever seen it and exponentially getting worse." 
The committee chairman, Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, confirmed recent reports of ambitious efforts by Chinese hacking groups - traced by one American computer security firm to a Chinese military unit in Shanghai - to penetrate American, European and Asian businesses and siphon off blueprints and corporate secrets.
Obama administration officials have said the attacks have become so intense that they threaten the fundamental relationship between the United States and China. Beijing has denied any role in computer hacking, saying the activity is illegal.
Asked on the ABC News program "This Week" whether he believed that the Chinese government and military were behind the economic espionage, Mr. Rogers replied, "Beyond a shadow of a doubt."
He said the attacks were illegal and unprecedented in scope, and that the United States was not currently able to protect American companies from them.
"We're not ready yet," he said. "We are completely vulnerable to this."
Mr. Rogers suggested that the United States use not just economic sanctions on those responsible but also to take tough action against specific Chinese individuals.
"I argue you need to start indicting bad actors," he said. "You need to start impacting individuals' ability who are participating in this activity in China to get visas, their families to get visas."
"It's that serious," he said.
Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on the same program that he had confronted top Chinese officials with the accusations during a recent visit to Beijing. "They just let it roll off their back," he said. "They pooh-poohed it." He said Washington should make it clear to the Chinese that "there's a price to pay."
While some reports have suggested that the United States and Israel were likely behind cyberattacks against Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Rogers made two points: First, he said, that people should be "very cautious about ascribing authorship" for those attacks and, second, that such defensive attacks were different from the sort of economic espionage that China is suspected to be involved in.
That, he said, was why he would "send a message to China that you cannot - if you want to be an international player, you can't act like a thief in the night."

In the television business, there is no such thing as a sure thing. You can have a gold-plated director, a bankable star and a popular concept and still, it's just a roll of the dice.
Or is it?
In any business, the ability to see into the future is the killer app, and Netflix may be getting close with ''House of Cards.'' The series, directed by David Fincher, starring Kevin Spacey and based on a popular British series, is already the most streamed piece of content in the United States and 40 other countries, according to Netflix. The spooky part about that? Executives at the company knew it would be a hit before anyone shouted ''action.''
Netflix, which has 27 million subscribers in the nation and 33 million worldwide, ran the numbers. It already knew that a healthy share had streamed the work of Mr. Fincher, the director of ''The Social Network,'' from beginning to end. And films featuring Mr. Spacey had always done well, as had the British version of ''House of Cards.'' With those three circles of interest, Netflix was able to find a Venn diagram intersection that suggested that buying the series would be a very good bet on original programming. 
Big bets are now being informed by Big Data, and no one knows more about audiences than Netflix. A third of the downloads on the Internet during peak periods on any given day are devoted to streamed movies from the service, according to Sandvine, a networking provider. And last year, by some estimates, more people watched movies streamed online than on physical DVDs.
Film and television producers have always used data, holding previews for focus groups and logging the results, but as a technology company that distributes and now produces content, Netflix has mind-boggling access to consumer sentiment in real time.
How much data does it have at its fingertips? According to GigaOm, Netflix looks at 30 million ''plays'' a day, including when you pause, rewind and fast forward, four million ratings by Netflix subscribers, three million searches as well as the time of day when shows are watched and on what devices.
Jonathan Friedland, the company's chief communications officer, said, ''Because we have a direct relationship with consumers, we know what people like to watch and that helps us understand how big the interest is going to be for a given show. It gave us some confidence that we could find an audience for a show like 'House of Cards.' ''
In addition, movies and TV shows on the service are annotated with hundreds of tags -- metadata descriptors -- inserted by viewers commissioned to describe the talent, the action, the tone and the genre, among many, many other things. In the past, those tags were used to recommend other shows from the long tail of content on the service, essentially building profiles based on the preferences of individual subscribers. But now Netflix is commissioning original content because it knows what people want before they do. ''There are 33 million different versions of Netflix,'' said Joris Evers, the company's director of global corporate communications.
Based on that information, Netflix bought ''House of Cards.'' It is also producing new episodes of ''Arrested Development,'' and in April, it will begin streaming episodes of ''Hemlock Grove,'' a horror-thriller based on a novel of the same name.
Netflix has always used data to decide which shows to license, and now that expertise is extended to the first-run. And there was not one trailer for ''House of Cards,'' there were many. Fans of Mr. Spacey saw trailers featuring him, women watching ''Thelma and Louise'' saw trailers featuring the show's female characters and serious film buffs saw trailers that reflected Mr. Fincher's touch.
It is impossible to say that ''House of Cards'' is a hit because Netflix, to the consternation of some of its more traditional competitors, is not participating in ratings. But social media is thick with mentions of both the new programming and the new paradigm. The show made the front page of The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, and was on the cover of Emmy magazine, a good omen for its awards future. And when your price is as low as Netflix's -- $7.99 a month for streaming -- a flurry of buzz can pull plenty of people off the fence.
While careers and entire networks have been made and lost based on the mysterious alchemy of finding a hit, Netflix seems to be making it look easy, or at least making it a product of logic and algorithms as opposed to tradition and instinct.
A cable executive who has talked to Amazon says that its Prime service, a nascent effort to get into original content, will also lean hard on data-driven approaches to determine its programming. The executive, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private, said it would change the way that business operates sooner than people thought.
''I think it is a little hysterical to say that Big Data will win the day now and forever, but it is clear that having a very molecular understanding of user data is going to have a big impact on how things happen in television,'' he said.
Others aren't so sure. John Landgraf, who, as president and general manager of FX Networks, has had a good run at the channel in finding hits, said he thought numbers-crunching would never have predicted the success of ''The Sopranos,'' ''South Park,'' and ''Mad Men,'' among others, including hits he has said yes to, like ''Sons of Anarchy.''
''Data can only tell you what people have liked before, not what they don't know they are going to like in the future,'' he said. ''A good high-end programmer's job is to find the white spaces in our collective psyche that aren't filled by an existing television show,'' adding, those choices were made ''in a black box that data can never penetrate.''
The rise of the quants has some worried about the impact on quality and diversity of programming. Writing in Salon, Andrew Leonard wonders ''how a reliance on Big Data might funnel craftsmanship in particular directions. What happens when directors approach the editing room armed with the knowledge that a certain subset of subscribers are opposed to jump cuts or get off on gruesome torture scenes'' or are just interested in sexual romps?
Netflix insists that actual creative decisions will remain in the hands of the creators. ''We don't get super-involved on the creative side,'' Mr. Evers said. ''We hire the right people and give the freedom and budget to do good work.'' That means that when Seth Rogen and Kristen Wiig are announced as special guests on coming episodes of ''Arrested Development,'' it is not because a statistical analysis told Netflix to do so.
But there are potential conflicts. Given that Netflix is in the business of recommending shows or movies, might its algorithms tilt in favor of the work it commissions as it goes deeper into original programming? It brings to mind how Google got crossed up when it began developing more products, and those began showing up in searches.
And there are concerns that the same thing that makes Netflix so valuable -- it knows everything about us -- could create problems if it is not careful with our data and our privacy. But many think the trade is worth it.
''Netflix and Amazon know when you stop and start a program, whether you wanted the whole thing, all of that,'' said Rick Smolan, whose most recent book was ''The Human Face of Big Data.'' ''Programmers have been wandering out and shooting a shotgun into the night sky and hoping they hit something, and I end up paying $150 for channels full of nothing I want to watch. These guys know what they are aiming at.''
Netflix's command of data, including mine, isn't foolproof. It thinks I like ''The West Wing,'' which I don't, and it thinks I am a sucker for every quirky little indie movie that floats in, which I am not. But when it came to guessing if ''House of Cards'' might appeal to me -- politics, media and Mr. Fincher are all hot buttons -- the deck was stacked in its favor.
Not long after the series became available, I found myself in a dark room, surrounded by empty food wrappers and unmet deadlines, wondering when the second season was going to start. I never had a chance.

HEADLINE: In Cyberspace, New Cold War

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the Obama administration circulated to the nation's Internet providers last week a lengthy confidential list of computer addresses linked to a hacking group that has stolen terabytes of data from American corporations, it left out one crucial fact: that nearly every one of the digital addresses could be traced to the neighborhood in Shanghai that is headquarters to the Chinese military's cybercommand.
That deliberate omission underscored the heightened sensitivities inside the Obama administration over just how directly to confront China's untested new leadership over the hacking issue, as the administration escalates demands that China halt the state-sponsored attacks that Beijing insists it is not mounting.
The issue illustrates how different the worsening cyber-cold war between the world's two largest economies is from the more familiar superpower conflicts of past decades -- in some ways less dangerous, in others more complex and pernicious. 
Administration officials say they are now more willing than before to call out the Chinese directly -- as Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. did last week in announcing a new strategy to combat theft of intellectual property. But President Obama avoided mentioning China by name -- or Russia or Iran, the other two countries the president worries most about -- when he declared in his State of the Union address that ''we know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.'' He added: ''Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions and our air traffic control systems.''
Defining ''enemies'' in this case is not always an easy task. China is not an outright foe of the United States, the way the Soviet Union once was; rather, China is both an economic competitor and a crucial supplier and customer. The two countries traded $425 billion in goods last year, and China remains, despite many diplomatic tensions, a critical financier of American debt. As Hillary Rodham Clinton put it to Australia's prime minister in 2009 on her way to visit China for the first time as secretary of state, ''How do you deal toughly with your banker?''
In the case of the evidence that the People's Liberation Army is probably the force behind ''Comment Crew,'' the biggest of roughly 20 hacking groups that American intelligence agencies follow, the answer is that the United States is being highly circumspect. Administration officials were perfectly happy to have Mandiant, a private security firm, issue the report tracing the cyberattacks to the door of China's cybercommand; American officials said privately that they had no problems with Mandiant's conclusions, but they did not want to say so on the record.
That explains why China went unmentioned as the location of the suspect servers in the warning to Internet providers. ''We were told that directly embarrassing the Chinese would backfire,'' one intelligence official said. ''It would only make them more defensive, and more nationalistic.''
That view is beginning to change, though. On the ABC News program ''This Week'' on Sunday, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, was asked whether he believed that the Chinese military and civilian government were behind the economic espionage. ''Beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' he replied.
In the next few months, American officials say, there will be many private warnings delivered by Washington to Chinese leaders, including Xi Jinping, who will soon assume China's presidency. Both Tom Donilon, the national security adviser, and Mrs. Clinton's successor, John Kerry, have trips to China in the offing. Those private conversations are expected to make a case that the sheer size and sophistication of the attacks over the past few years threaten to erode support for China among the country's biggest allies in Washington, the American business community.
''America's biggest global firms have been ballast in the relationship'' with China, said Kurt M. Campbell, who recently resigned as assistant secretary of state for East Asia to start a consulting firm, the Asia Group, to manage the prickly commercial relationships. ''And now they are the ones telling the Chinese that these pernicious attacks are undermining what has been built up over decades.''
It is too early to tell whether that appeal to China's self-interest is getting through. Similar arguments have been tried before, yet when one of China's most senior military leaders visited the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon in May 2011, he said he didn't know much about cyberweapons -- and said the P.L.A. does not use them. In that regard, he sounded a bit like the Obama administration, which has never discussed America's own cyberarsenal.
Yet the P.LA.'s attacks are largely at commercial targets. It has an interest in trade secrets like aerospace designs and wind-energy product schematics: the army is deeply invested in Chinese industry and is always seeking a competitive advantage. And so far the attacks have been cost-free.
American officials say that must change. But the prescriptions for what to do vary greatly -- from calm negotiation to economic sanctions and talk of counterattacks led by the American military's Cyber Command, the unit that was deeply involved in the American and Israeli cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear enrichment plants.
''The problem so far is that we have rhetoric and we have Cyber Command, and not much in between,'' said Chris Johnson, a 20-year veteran of the C.I.A. team that analyzed the Chinese leadership. ''That's what makes this so difficult. It's easy for the Chinese to deny it's happening, to say it's someone else, and no one wants the U.S. government launching counterattacks.''
That marks another major difference from the dynamic of the American-Soviet nuclear rivalry. In cold war days, deterrence was straightforward: any attack would result in a devastating counterattack, at a human cost so horrific that neither side pulled the trigger, even during close calls like the Cuban missile crisis.
But cyberattacks are another matter. The vast majority have taken the form of criminal theft, not destruction. It often takes weeks or months to pin down where an attack originated, because attacks are generally routed through computer servers elsewhere to obscure their source. A series of attacks on The New York Times that originated in China, for example, was mounted through the computer systems of unwitting American universities. That is why David Rothkopf, the author of books about the National Security Council, wrote last week that this was a ''cool war,'' not only because of the remote nature of the attacks but because ''it can be conducted indefinitely -- permanently, even -- without triggering a shooting war. At least, that is the theory.''
Administration officials like Robert Hormats, the under secretary of state for business and economic affairs, say the key to success in combating cyberattacks is to emphasize to the Chinese authorities that the attacks will harm their hopes for economic growth. ''We have to make it clear,'' Mr. Hormats said, ''that the Chinese are not going to get what they desire,'' which he said was ''investment from the cream of our technology companies, unless they quickly get this problem under control.''
But Mr. Rogers of the Intelligence Committee argues for a more confrontational approach, including ''indicting bad actors'' and denying visas to anyone believed to be involved in cyberattacks, as well as their families.
The coming debate is over whether the government should get into the business of retaliation. Already, Washington is awash in conferences that talk about ''escalation dominance'' and ''extended deterrence,'' all terminology drawn from the cold war.
Some of the talk is overheated, fueled by a growing cybersecurity industry and the development of offensive cyberweapons, even though the American government has never acknowledged using them, even in the Stuxnet attacks on Iran. But there is a serious, behind-the-scenes discussion about what kind of attack on American infrastructure -- something the Chinese hacking groups have not seriously attempted -- could provoke a president to order a counterattack.

HEADLINE: Eyes on Town After Tale of Strippers at a Teenage Party

BYLINE: By PAUL POST

 BODY:
SOUTH GLENS FALLS, N.Y. -- At the southern end of town, about a mile and a half from Cooper's Cave, a spot memorialized in James Fenimore Cooper's ''Last of the Mohicans,'' a far less bucolic locale has dragged this small North Country community of 3,500 people into the limelight.
Inside the Spare Time Family Fun Center, a 42-lane bowling alley, a November birthday party for a 16-year-old boy has gained an outsize level of notoriety because of the party favors offered that day: two exotic dancers, who performed for some of the invited guests. 
The dancers entertained in a separate, enclosed bar area, and the glass doors and windows were covered with brown paper so bowlers and other patrons could not see what was going on.
But South Glens Falls is a small town, and word spread quickly, especially on social media.
''It was all over Facebook,'' said Xavier DeLuke, a 17-year-old junior at South Glens Falls High School.
Daniele Fish, a parent, said, ''I'm sure a lot of kids knew about it right away. My sixth-grader came home and told me about it.''
But it was not until last Monday, when the boy's mother, Judy H. Viger, 33, was arrested on charges of endangering the welfare of a child, that the episode went viral.
Calls have come in from media outlets around the world. Jay Leno even opened his monologue Thursday night with a three-joke sequence about the party.
''Hey,'' Mr. Leno said. ''Have you heard about this?''
The answer, to the dismay of many residents here, was an unqualified yes.
''It's mind-boggling,'' said the mayor of South Glens Falls, Keith Donohue. ''My sister and brother-in-law live in D.C. and it's the talk of the town down there, too.''
About 80 people were present at the party, including guests as young as 14. Some who were upset by the lewd conduct told their parents, who reported the incident to police.
''They were expecting ice cream, cake and presents, not lap dancing and exotic dancing,'' said the Saratoga County district attorney, James A. Murphy III.
Ms. Viger, of nearby Gansevoort, is accused of hiring two female adult ''entertainers'' who performed ''personal and intimate dances'' for some party attendees, police said.
Photos surfaced on Facebook. One picture, made available by Mr. Murphy's office, shows a female dancer, wearing only a thong and bikini top, with her legs wrapped around a teenage boy's head and shoulders.
The exotic dancers work for a business called Tops In Bottoms, in Albany, that provides female adult entertainers for special events.
''A lot of bad decisions were made,'' the company's owner, Nathan Rice, said.
Ms. Viger, who is to be arraigned on March 7, could not be reached, and her lawyer, Joseph Brennan, did not return calls for comment. Because Ms. Viger is charged with a misdemeanor and she has no prior convictions, she probably will face no jail time, Mr. Murphy said.
Police said no other arrests are expected.
Mr. Murphy said he believes the charges are appropriate, primarily because the activities Ms. Viger organized involved other people's children.
''Parents of the children who attended had no idea that the adult female entertainers would be present and were shocked and stunned when they discovered what had occurred,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, it's a salacious story that has all the ingredients for what it seems people want to read about.''
Employees at the bowling alley refused to talk about the incident; Spare Time's parent company, Bowl New England, said in a statement that it did not arrange or pay for ''the entertainment that was provided at the party.'' The company said it is cooperating with law enforcement authorities.
South Glens Falls is in northernmost Saratoga County, and sits beside the Hudson River as it rushes down out of the Adirondacks toward New York City, about 200 miles away.
Large paper mills, a major source of local industry, line the banks on both sides of the river, their huge plumes of billowing white steam a constant presence in the local landscape. Cooper's Cave has become a tourist spot and a source of local pride, but in many ways, South Glens Falls has struggled to establish an identity distinct from Glens Falls, its much larger neighbor to the north.
The village has also been slow to benefit from the fast-paced economic growth of southern Saratoga County, fueled by GlobalFoundries' new $6.9 billion semiconductor plant. South Glens Falls is an incorporated village in the Town of Moreau, and both town and village have hopes of attracting spinoff businesses related to the growth.
Yet the Moreau Industrial Park, created about 20 years ago, has just one tenant.
Many people here said it was unfortunate that the bowling party has attracted so much attention, especially when there are other, more substantive issues and concerns.
At the high school, for example, a marathon dance charity event, which raised $395,352 last year, takes place this weekend, and the students hope to raise more than $400,000 this year.
Goods and services are donated by dozens of local business leaders, including Arthur Dare, a barber who cuts hair during the dance, and gives all his proceeds to the charitable event.
Mr. Dare said he came home from work late Thursday night and saw Mr. Leno joking about South Glens Falls. ''I just feel bad that 600 good kids and the community work so hard on the dance marathon and the focus is on this,'' he said. ''It's all about strippers.''

HEADLINE: As Governors Meet, White House Outlines Drop in Aid to States

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In an effort to put pressure on Congressional Republicans, the White House warned on Sunday that automatic budget cuts scheduled to take effect this week would have a devastating impact on programs for people of all ages in every state.
Cabinet officers sounded the alarm on television talk shows, and their concerns resonated with state officials, who were in town for the winter meeting of the National Governors Association. 
Daniel I. Werfel, the controller of President Obama's budget office, held an unusual Sunday briefing to catalog the effects of the cuts state by state.
He and Jason Furman, the principal deputy director of the National Economic Council, said they were not exaggerating the damage that would be done.
In place of the across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, Mr. Obama wants Congress to agree to what he calls a ''balanced plan.'' The plan includes cuts in selected domestic programs, savings in certain benefit programs and additional tax revenue collected from some corporations and high-income people.
The conflict is shaping up as a real-world test of the importance and value of the federal government. Democrats expressed confidence that Americans would feel the impact of an $85 billion cut in a $3.5 trillion budget, while Republicans insisted that they would not accept new taxes on top of those signed into law by Mr. Obama last month.
The White House intensified its campaign just as Congress was returning to work this week and some governors were expressing anguish over the impact of the impending automatic cuts in federal spending.
''We don't do across-the-board cuts in state government, and it's a stupid idea in the federal government,'' said Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, a Democrat.
But Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska, a Republican, said in an interview: ''The White House is engaged in scare tactics. Every governor in this country knows how to cut their budget by 2 or 3 percent, and the White House ought to learn how to do it.''
''The sequester is not the best way to do it,'' Mr. Heineman added. ''We need greater flexibility in that process. But it's hard for me to believe that America is going to be devastated by the federal government cutting its budget 2 or 3 percent. That's a bunch of malarkey.''
Another Republican, Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, said in an interview, ''The White House is in a campaign mode of trying to scare everybody, rather than sitting down with Congress and working out what the solution is to the budget.''
State-by-state estimates of the impact of federal policies have been a staple of White House efforts to mobilize public opinion for more than 20 years.
In its report Sunday, the White House described how the budget cuts would hit states, with an emphasis on jobs lost.
''Ohio will lose approximately $25.1 million in funding for primary and secondary education, putting around 350 teacher and aide jobs at risk,'' the White House said. ''In Georgia, around 4,180 fewer children will receive vaccines for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough, influenza and hepatitis B due to reduced funding for vaccinations of about $286,000.
''Pennsylvania could lose up to $271,000 in funds that provide services to victims of domestic violence, resulting in up to 1,000 fewer victims being served. In Texas, approximately 52,000 civilian Department of Defense employees would be furloughed, reducing gross pay by around $274.8 million in total.''
In addition, the White House said, many of the nation's 398 national parks would be partly or fully closed.
On Friday, the administration said, $85 billion in cuts will automatically begin to take effect, with many domestic programs facing reductions of 9 percent and some military programs being reduced by 13 percent in the remaining seven months of the federal fiscal year.
Appearing Sunday on the CBS program ''Face the Nation,'' Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, a Democrat, described the cuts as a threat to the economy.
''These are job-killing cuts, and we have to find a way to avoid them,'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''We cannot cut our way to prosperity. We need a balanced approach to continue our jobs recovery.''
Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, portrayed the Republicans as willful and obstinate.
''Republicans have decided they want the sequester to go into effect,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said in a conference call with journalists. ''They have decided that they are not open to compromise, that these cuts should happen, that these cuts are better for the country, better for 100,000 Americans to lose their jobs. It's better for people to wait in longer lines at airports; it's better for kids to get kicked out of Head Start than to close a few loopholes that benefit the wealthy. That's the choice they've made.''
Mr. Pfeiffer said Republicans were undermining their own long-term goal of deficit reduction because ''they don't want to give the president the win of additional revenue.''
Republicans say the tax changes proposed by the president would stifle economic growth.
Sean M. Spicer, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said Republicans agreed that ''the sequester is not the right way to control federal spending.'' But he described the White House report on the state-by-state impact as ''a public relations stunt.''
In deciding how to carry out the cuts, Mr. Werfel said, agencies have only ''limited flexibility.''
''There are constraints to what an agency can do in taking this across-the-board $85 billion cut,'' Mr. Werfel said. ''The way the law is written, it has to be taken from a percentage cut from every program, project and activity.''
Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, which created the latest version of the sequester, some programs, like Medicaid and food stamps, are exempt from the automatic cuts, and cuts in Medicare payments cannot exceed 2 percent.
Social Security benefits would not be cut. But the White House said that the automatic budget cuts would force the agency to ''curtail service to the public,'' and that the backlog of Social Security disability claims would increase.

HEADLINE: In France, a Proposal to Tax Data Harvesting Is Aimed at Altering Web Practices

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- Only a few weeks after the French Constitutional Council rejected one new tax idea -- a 75 percent levy on annual incomes of more than 1 million euros ($1.3 million) -- another began percolating through the halls of the finance ministry here: a proposal to tax the collection of personal data on the Internet.
Google and Facebook know that John Doe ''likes'' wine, is shopping for a Volkswagen and often e-mails Jane Doe. The new idea would require the companies to pay for gathering that information. 
Nicolas Colin, one of the authors of a report in which the idea of taxing data collection was floated in January, said the immediate goal would be to promote sound practices for data collection and protection.
While the report does not specify how much revenue the tax would yield, Mr. Colin said it would probably be minimal.
''It's meant to incentivize everyone to operate at a higher level, not to raise a lot of money,'' he said. ''You can't go from zero to collecting hundreds of millions overnight.''
Like other European countries, France has been frustrated by its inability to raise significant tax revenue from the billions of dollars in sales and profits that Internet companies, many of them American, generate in Europe every year.
And despite so-called austerity measures, budget deficits remain large.
''Every government needs revenues,'' Mr. Colin, a government auditor and technology entrepreneur, said in an interview. ''If they can't get them from the most profitable companies, then they have to get them from the rest of us -- individual taxpayers and smaller, struggling companies.''
Internet companies like Amazon.com, Facebook and Google stay largely out of reach of tax collectors in large European countries like Britain, France and Germany by routing their sales through smaller countries, like Ireland and Luxembourg, where corporate tax rates are lower. The companies insist that such practices are permitted under European Union law and international taxation treaties.
France and other countries have begun talks to change those conventions, so Internet companies could be taxed in the country where a sale takes place, rather than in the location where the transaction is recorded. But that could take many years, with no guarantee of any change.
On the other hand, France could impose a tax on data collection unilaterally and quickly, Mr. Colin said.
The prospects for his proposal are unclear. While the report was commissioned by the government, it is not an official policy document, and the finance ministry has yet to take a position on the idea.
On other issues involving the digital economy, the administration of President François Hollande has sent mixed signals. After threatening Google with a law that would have let publishers charge the search engine for links to their Web sites, for example, the government backed down and accepted a negotiated deal that maintains Google's existing business model, under which links are free.
The French data protection agency, which is known by the initials C.N.I.L. and is independent of the government, has been more forthcoming about the taxation proposal.
''Personal data are the fuel of the digital economy,'' Edouard Geffray, the agency's secretary general, told the French version of the online magazine Slate. ''Given that, it would seem like a natural idea to envision taxing the use of them.''
While business plans built on mining consumers' personal information from the Internet are proliferating, so are concerns about the use of the data.
Last week, the data protection authorities of the 27 European Union countries threatened Google with punitive action over a privacy policy that the company put in effect last year, under which it harvests data from a range of services. The agencies, led by C.N.I.L., gave Google four months to make changes or face legal action. Google insists its policy complies with European Union law.
A recent study by Ovum, a research firm in London, showed that 81 percent of Internet users in France would use a ''do not track'' feature on Web sites if it were readily available. That was the highest percentage in any of the 11 countries surveyed.
''The privacy market is heating up,'' said Mark Little, an analyst at Ovum. ''There is a move away from what I would call data fracking to consumers' creating their own contracts governing data use, and corporations' having to abide by those.''
Mr. Colin said the main goal of his tax plan would be to reward companies for providing their customers with useful information, while penalizing those that did not do so.
Internet companies, for example, could be taxed if they collected ''cookies'' -- digital markers of the Web sites that Internet users visit -- without enabling consumers to see how the information was used. Companies that did provide that information readily would be exempt.
Analysts call such a practice ''smart disclosure'' because it can help consumers make informed decisions. Utilities that provide consumers with more detailed information on, for example, their patterns of electricity or natural gas consumption could help them reduce their bills.
Mr. Colin said there was no intention to stop Internet companies from collecting data.
''That would be bad for business, and it would hurt French companies too,'' he said.
While Internet companies are not alone in collecting vast amounts of data, Mr. Colin made it clear that the proposal was aimed at the likes of Google and Facebook, which are making inroads in more and more areas.
''I'm convinced the telecoms, even car manufacturers, will be disrupted by these companies,'' Mr. Colin said. ''We'd better learn to tax them before they eat the whole economy.''
A secondary purpose of the proposal, Mr. Colin said, would be to provide leverage in negotiations for a change in international conventions on corporate taxes. If those were altered so that France could tax foreign Internet companies on their profits, then the data tax could be dropped, he said.
''In France, we are seen as a nation of tax lovers, which isn't always good for the French image, and isn't always true, either,'' he said. ''But it is true that we are leaders in this area. Maybe the French government has the opportunity to make the case for accelerated negotiations.''

HEADLINE: 'Bloodless' Lung Transplants Offer Hint at Surgery's Future

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Last April, after being told that only a transplant could save her from a fatal lung condition, Rebecca S. Tomczak began calling some of the top-ranked hospitals in the country.
She started with Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, just hours from her home near Augusta, Ga. Then she tried Duke and the University of Arkansas and Johns Hopkins. Each advised Ms. Tomczak, then 69, to look somewhere else.
The reason: Ms. Tomczak, who was baptized at age 12 as a Jehovah's Witness, insisted for religious reasons that her transplant be performed without a blood transfusion. The Witnesses believe that Scripture prohibits the transfusion of blood, even one's own, at the risk of forfeiting eternal life.
Given the complexities of lung transplantation, in which transfusions are routine, some doctors felt the procedure posed unacceptable dangers. Others could not get past the ethics of it all. With more than 1,600 desperately ill people waiting for a donated lung, was it appropriate to give one to a woman who might needlessly sacrifice her life and the organ along with it? 
By the time Ms. Tomczak found Dr. Scott A. Scheinin at The Methodist Hospital in Houston last spring, he had long since made peace with such quandaries. Like a number of physicians, he had become persuaded by a growing body of research that transfusions often pose unnecessary risks and should be avoided when possible, even in complicated cases.
By cherry-picking patients with low odds of complications, Dr. Scheinin felt he could operate almost as safely without blood as with it. The way he saw it, patients declined lifesaving therapies all the time, for all manner of reasons, and it was not his place to deny care just because those reasons were sometimes religious or unconventional.
''At the end of the day,'' he had resolved, ''if you agree to take care of these patients, you agree to do it on their terms.''
Ms. Tomczak's case -- the 11th so-called bloodless lung transplant attempted at Methodist over three years -- would become the latest test of an innovative approach that was developed to accommodate the unique beliefs of the world's eight million Jehovah's Witnesses but may soon become standard practice for all surgical patients.
Unlike other patients, Ms. Tomczak would have no backstop. Explicit in her understanding with Dr. Scheinin was that if something went terribly wrong, he would allow her to bleed to death. He had watched Witness patients die before, with a lifesaving elixir at hand.
Ms. Tomczak had dismissed the prospect of a transplant for most of the two years she had struggled with sarcoidosis, a progressive condition of unknown cause that leads to scarring in the lungs. The illness forced her to quit a part-time job with Nielsen, the market research firm.
Then in April, on a trip to the South Carolina coast, she found that she was too breathless to join her frolicking grandchildren on the beach. Tethered to an oxygen tank, she watched from the boardwalk, growing sad and angry and then determined to reclaim her health.
''I wanted to be around and be a part of their lives,'' Ms. Tomczak recalled, dabbing at tears.
She knew there was danger in refusing to take blood. But she thought the greater peril would come from offending God.
''I know,'' she said, ''that if I did anything that violates Jehovah's law, I would not make it into the new system, where he's going to make earth into a paradise. I know there are risks. But I think I am covered.''
Cutting Risks, and Costs
The approach Dr. Scheinin would use -- originally called ''bloodless medicine'' but later re-branded as ''patient blood management'' -- has been around for decades. His mentor at Methodist, Dr. Denton A. Cooley, the renowned cardiac pioneer, performed heart surgery on hundreds of Witnesses starting in the late 1950s. The first bloodless lung transplant, at Johns Hopkins, was in 1996.
But nearly 17 years later, the degree of difficulty for such procedures remains so high that Dr. Scheinin and his team are among the very few willing to attempt them.
In 2009, after analyzing Methodist's own data, Dr. Scheinin became convinced that if he selected patients carefully, he could perform lung transplants without transfusions. Hospital administrators resisted at first, knowing that even small numbers of deaths could bring scrutiny from federal regulators.
''My job is to push risk away,'' said Dr. A. Osama Gaber, the hospital's director of transplantation, ''so I wasn't really excited about it. But the numbers were very convincing.''
None of the 10 patients who preceded Ms. Tomczak, including two who had double-lung transplants, had problems related to surgical blood loss or postoperative anemia, Dr. Scheinin said. The first, a North Carolina man who received a lung in 2009, died in November after developing internal bleeding and an infection. Several others had various postoperative complications, but all were doing fine, Dr. Scheinin said.
Dr. Scheinin, 52, a native New Yorker, said he liked the tightrope walker's rush of operating without a net. He said his focus was intensified by the knowledge that if a patient died for lack of blood, a second life might hang in the balance -- the wait-listed patient who would otherwise have received the organ.
''If I agree to do an aortic bypass on a patient who refuses blood, and it's a risk we're both willing to take, that's between me and him,'' Dr. Scheinin said. ''With a transplant, if the patient dies, you risk having people say you wasted a precious organ.''
But Dr. Scheinin and his team are also motivated by the broader agenda -- of limiting transfusions for all surgical patients, not just those with religious objections.
The latest government data show that one of every 400 units transfused is associated with an adverse event like an allergic reaction, circulatory overload or sepsis. Even so, the share of hospital procedures that include a transfusion, usually of two or three units, has doubled in 12 years, to one in 10.
Yet at dozens of hospitals with programs that cater to Jehovah's Witnesses, a million-patient market in the United States, researchers have found that surgical patients typically do just fine without transfusions.
''They are surviving things that on paper were not expected to go well at all,'' said Sherri J. Ozawa, a nurse who directs the long-established bloodless medicine program at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey.
The economy is also helping the blood management movement. Processing and transfusing a single unit of blood can cost as much as $1,200, and many hospitals are trying to cut back. Administrators at Methodist said their bloodless lung transplants typically cost 30 percent less than other lung transplants, partly because careful management of hemoglobin levels before surgery has resulted in fewer complications and shorter stays.
Experts say they are beginning to see a measurable impact on blood usage, although the data to support it are not yet available. Dr. Richard J. Benjamin, the chief medical officer of the American Red Cross, predicted that the numbers would show the first decline in use since the AIDS scare began in the 1980s, perhaps by one million units.
''We're changing this culture, this knee-jerk transfusion reaction,'' Dr. Scheinin said. ''And I think that's been a good thing for all our patients.''
A Plan in Place
In October, the Tomczaks sent their poodle, Coco, to live with friends and moved temporarily to Houston. They stayed for the first month in a tidy suburban house with a Witness couple, Peter and Gerry Deichler, whom they had never met. The arrangements had been made by the church's hospital liaison committee, a nationwide network that connects patients with doctors.
Two days after arriving, Ms. Tomczak walked Methodist's long corridors as her husband, Gene, wheeled her oxygen tank behind her. Although wheezing and weary, she was characteristically cheerful as she endured numerous tests and met her doctors for the first time.
Ms. Tomczak, a nonsmoker who had been trim before falling ill, took mock offense when one doctor read from her chart that she had become obese. ''He is supposed to say that I'm fluffy,'' she objected.
Dr. Scheinin explained that the disease had shrunk her lung capacity by nearly half. The good news, he said, was that a CT scan showed that she did not have the kind of adhesions that might cause heavy bleeding during surgery.
The doctors reviewed the form Ms. Tomczak had signed to ''knowingly refuse consent'' for transfusions of whole blood and its four primary components -- oxygen-carrying red cells, infection-fighting white cells, clot-forming platelets and plasma. The form released the doctors from any liability if she died for lack of blood.
Five days later, the hospital added Ms. Tomczak to its waiting list for a lung from a deceased donor. To determine her rank, the team's pulmonologist, Dr. Harish Seethamraju, calculated a score based on how urgently she needed a transplant and how long she was likely to survive.
It placed her among the top half of candidates listed nationally, and Dr. Seethamraju predicted that it would take two to three months for her to rise up the list and be matched. Without a transplant, he gave her a 50 percent chance of surviving a year.
The hospital's charges for a lung transplant, which would be paid by Medicare and a supplemental private policy, would most likely approach half a million dollars.
When Ms. Tomczak announced in a family conference call that she planned to have the transplant without a transfusion, her three daughters did not mount much of a challenge. They knew she was serious enough about her faith to carry a wallet card warning medics not to treat her with blood.
But they nonetheless found the prospects unsettling. Ms. Tomczak's eldest daughter, Kim R. Davis, 49, who left the church as a teenager, struggled to make sense of the seeming inconsistencies, like how Witnesses could have transplants but not transfusions. ''It's hard for me to reconcile,'' said Ms. Davis, who lives in Charlotte, N.C. ''But she strongly believes in this.''
Founded in the late 19th century and best known for door-to-door evangelism, the Jehovah's Witnesses first published a position on transfusions in 1945, as the blood donation system expanded after World War II. It grew out of edicts in both the Old and New Testaments that forbid the consumption of blood, which is revered as a life source. The church, based in Brooklyn, takes the position that there is no distinction between oral consumption and intravenous feeding.
The Witnesses' hard line does have its soft spots. The church declared in 2000 that it was up to members to decide whether to accept blood fractions like clotting factors that are extracted from plasma. It has also left to individual conscience whether to accept synthetic proteins that stimulate red cell production or to use mechanical techniques that conserve and salvage blood.
Ms. Tomczak consented to allow all of those additional measures.
Waiting for an Organ
There were times during the nerve-fraying wait, as it stretched past Thanksgiving and Christmas and into the new year, that Ms. Tomczak felt ready to give up and go home.
The boredom had grown oppressive in the small apartment that she and her husband eventually rented, interrupted only by people-watching at Walmart and card games at a senior center. Two urgent calls from the hospital, both false alarms, had jangled her nerves.
In January came the news that Mr. Tomczak had cancer of the pancreas and liver. He had complained of abdominal pain for months, but it had been dismissed as a recurrence of his diverticulitis, an intestinal inflammation.
The diagnosis shocked the couple, and their attention had shifted to Mr. Tomczak's care when Ms. Tomczak's cellphone rang shortly before 9 p.m. on Jan. 30. It was the hospital. There was a lung, from a donor in New Mexico, and it was hers if she wanted it.
Before long, a surgeon from Methodist was taking off on a chartered jet for Albuquerque to recover the lung. Thirty minutes into the trip, the co-pilot announced that the plane's flaps had malfunctioned, forcing a return to Houston. After a two-hour delay, another plane set off.
The donor, Raisa M. Montoya, 24, a single mother who had collapsed mysteriously, had been declared brain-dead three days earlier and was on life support as officials worked to place her organs. When the doctor from Methodist arrived, a team from another hospital had already started removing her liver.
After its flight back to Houston, the donor's right lung arrived in the operating room at Methodist, iced in a blue cooler, at 9:35 a.m. Donated lungs remain viable on ice for only about six hours, so Dr. Scheinin had less than three hours to finish the transplant.
It had been a long night for the Tomczaks. While in the waiting room, Mr. Tomczak, 80, began having tremors and dizziness, wound up in the emergency room and was later admitted. The couple waved their goodbyes in a video chat on a pair of iPhones.
Before rolling into the operating room, Ms. Tomczak joined in a short prayer. Then she asked Dr. Scheinin if he had gotten plenty of rest. ''I don't want to hear any 'oopses,' '' she said.
Before surgery, doctors ordered doses of intravenous iron and Aranesp, a drug that stimulates red cell production. They also limited the number of blood draws for lab testing. Every milliliter might count.
As Dr. Scheinin opened the thoracic cavity and began cauterizing his way through tissue, another surgeon suctioned blood with a long tube. Rather than disposing of it as medical waste, he routed it through a hose into the cylinder of a cell salvage machine.
A centrifuge spun out the heavy red cells, which were washed with saline and later returned through a port in Ms. Tomczak's jugular vein. The church does not view this as a transfusion because the blood ostensibly remains in a continuous circuit with the body.
The same was true of a process called hemodilution. At the outset of the operation, doctors ordered a unit of whole blood removed from Ms. Tomczak and replaced it with saline to maintain her blood pressure. The process diluted the hemoglobin concentration of her remaining blood, cushioning the impact of any blood loss. The drawn blood hung in a bag from a pole until shortly after the new lung was transplanted, when it was returned to the body.
Dr. Scheinin worked with cool and quiet focus as a soundtrack shuffled from ZZ Top to Bob Seger to Lynyrd Skynyrd. With Ms. Tomczak breathing on a ventilator, he clamped the pulmonary artery and vein, severed them and the bronchus and lifted her diseased lung into a bowl. It was riddled with BB-size nodules, hard to the touch.
After suturing in the new lung with methodical strokes, Dr. Scheinin unclamped the vessels and prodded the organ to inflate like a beach ball. The lung began to rise and fall in precise rhythm.
Ms. Tomczak's recovery has not been without setbacks, albeit unrelated to her hemoglobin levels. Two weeks after the transplant, while building stamina in a rehabilitation unit, she contracted pneumonia in her new lung. Enough fluid accumulated that Dr. Scheinin had to surgically insert a tube and drain a liter. She is being treated with antibiotics.
Tests also detected the presence of unwelcome antibodies, which Dr. Seethamraju addressed with intravenous immunoglobulin, one of the blood proteins that Ms. Tomczak had consented to accept. But the doctors said scans and a biopsy otherwise showed that the lung was working properly, with no signs of major rejection. They expected Ms. Tomczak to be hospitalized for several more weeks, and to remain in Houston for monitoring for six months.
In a raspy telephone interview from her hospital room, Ms. Tomczak said that although sore from the trauma, she could feel a difference in the depth of her breathing. ''I'm back from the dead,'' she said, adding that she was eager to care for her husband, who had been discharged with a grim prognosis.
She expressed amazement -- ''Well, how about that?'' -- when told that the drop in her hemoglobin levels, measured before and immediately after surgery, had been barely perceptible. Jehovah, she said, must have been guiding Dr. Scheinin's hand. Given what they had achieved together, that sat just fine with Dr. Scheinin, who is Jewish.
''Over the years, I've been blessed by Catholic priests, rabbis, Baptist ministers, even a Buddhist monk or two,'' he said. ''I wouldn't trade in my surgical skills for a life of piety. But can anyone deny that a higher power doesn't have some bearing on how this all plays out?''

HEADLINE: For Stocks, An Upturn Is Battered By Doubts

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
The investor euphoria that began the year is beginning to seem like a hazy dream.
After looking to be ready to rocket past milestone levels just a few weeks ago, the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has been stalled, and is now coming out of its first negative week of the year.
The index could just as easily have ended last week in the black -- it was down only 0.3 percent -- and it is still just a few good days away from the nominal high set in 2007. But there has been a distinct shift in the sentiment on trading desks, as investors have returned their focus to the risks of the automatic federal budget cuts set to begin on March 1, and to the possibility that the Italian elections will produce an ineffective government. 
Beyond these risks, though, economists say that investors entered the year with too much enthusiasm and ignored signs that the United States was still in a period of slow economic growth.
''The optimism that got built into the market assumed that things were going to get a lot better,'' said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. ''Truly, things are not getting really good. They are just so-so, as they have been.''
The S.& P. 500 index is now almost exactly where it was at the beginning of February, but there is lots of speculation that the market is due for a downturn after rising nearly 6 percent in January.
''Everybody is looking for some type of pullback,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at the Solaris Group. ''It's what the chatter is out there from traders.''
The shift in opinion has extended to smaller investors. A poll of individual investors found last week that bearish sentiment had risen above the historical average for the first time this year. Those saving for retirement who were pouring money into stock mutual funds through January have dialed it back to a trickle.
The political agreement early in the year to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff seemed to remove one of the last major weights that had been dragging down the economy, opening up the possibility of faster growth. But that compromise did not avert a two percentage point increase in the payroll tax, which is already being blamed for the slowdown in consumer spending that Wal-Mart Stores reported last week.
At the same time, Congress decided at the beginning of the year to delay the automatic budget cuts, known as sequestration, until March 1 rather than cancel them altogether. The spirit of political compromise seemed to be in the air, but Democrats and Republicans are showing no signs now of coming together to avert a $44 billion reduction in federal spending in 2013. Economists have said the cuts could hold back economic growth by half a percentage point this year.
In presenting their financial results for the last three months of 2012, American companies have also been reining in expectations that profits will remain at the elevated levels of last few years.
Seventy-nine companies in the S.& P. 500 index have warned in their quarterly earnings presentations that their future profits will be lower than analysts expect, while only 19 have said profits will be better than expected, according to Thomson Reuters. This has led analysts to lower their expectations for profits in the current quarter.
Many strategists say these hurdles for the economy are likely to be temporary, while the type of existential crises that weighed on stock prices for the last few years have largely dissipated.
James O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said that he was prepared for economic data to show signs of a slight slowdown over the next few months. But he said that the recovery in housing prices looked set to continue at the same time that companies are putting more money into hiring new employees.
''The recovery still looks pretty secure,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said.
Even if the markets do begin to take off again, the Federal Reserve is likely to serve as an impediment to any big upward moves. The central bank has said that when the economy assumes a steadier footing, it will stop the bond buying programs that have pushed markets up since the financial crisis.
One hint of what could happen came last week, when the Fed released minutes from its January meeting, indicating that its members were growing more divided on how long the stimulus program should continue. That news led to the biggest one-day market decline of the year. By the end of the week, though, Fed officials were emphasizing that the bond buying was not likely to stop anytime soon.
There is an outspoken contingent in the investing community that believes the Fed's actions will bring their own problems, encouraging a bubble in riskier assets that will end in another financial crisis. The Fed has discounted those worries, and the consensus among strategists is that a slow but steady recovery is under way.
''There are things to be worried about out there,'' Mr. Ghriskey said, ''but to us, the outlook for the U.S. is favorable with short-term blips.''

HEADLINE: Governor of New Mexico, and Now an Envoy for Republicans

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
SANTA FE, N.M. -- If there is one trait of Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, that irks lawmakers on the opposite side of the aisle, it is her reluctance to negotiate. Ms. Martinez handles the Legislature in much the same way that she made a name for herself as a county prosecutor -- a tough-as-nails approach that helped carry her all the way to the state's highest government post.
On one of the defining issues of her tenure, the fight to repeal the state's law allowing illegal immigrants to get a driver's license, her persistence -- or intransigence, depending on whom you ask -- may have paid off. She immediately embraced a bipartisan bill introduced on Feb. 13 that would do just that; though to hear her tell it, she also gave in by supporting an alternate driver's license for young immigrants benefiting from deferred deportation.
Ms. Martinez's spokesman called it a ''very reasonable compromise.'' It comes at a perfect time for the governor, who is about to travel the country as an envoy of the Republican Party, recruiting Latinos to run for office or, at the very least, to give the party a second chance. (Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada has also been drafted for the same role.) 
Ms. Martinez, 53, is by many measures the ideal ambassador: accomplished, charming and not afraid to speak her mind. She took office in 2011 as the nation's first Latina governor, a distinction that alone qualifies her as a role model. In New Mexico, though, she has faced steady and increasingly vociferous criticism over the disconnect between the tone of her pronouncements and the substance of her policies.
While Ms. Martinez deplored Mitt Romney's suggestion of ''self-deportation'' as a solution to illegal immigration, she also directed police officers in New Mexico to inquire about the immigration status of those arrested, a move described by one immigrants' advocate as ''our mini S.B. 1070,'' a reference to Arizona's restrictive immigration law.
While she has promoted economic recovery as one of her major goals, Ms. Martinez has almost single-handedly fought for repealing the driver's license law. And all along she has refused to entertain any deals.
''The governor is very good at staying on message, but she doesn't have a diverse message,'' said State Senator John Arthur Smith, a conservative Democrat from southern New Mexico and a sponsor of the driver's license bill endorsed by Ms. Martinez. ''The risk for her is that people can get tired of it.''
Ms. Martinez said she keeps a list of the promises she made during her election campaign and puts check marks next to those she has fulfilled.
''I don't waver from them,'' she said during an interview in her office here, and then went on to recite her foremost accomplishments: raising the state's dismal high school graduation rate by 7 points, to 70 percent; eliminating a locomotive fuel tax, which was decisive in luring the Union Pacific Railroad from El Paso to southeastern New Mexico, where it is building a $400 million hub; and promoting a program that has made it easier for trucks from Mexico to unload their cargo in New Mexico, resulting in record-setting traffic at two of the state's border-crossing ports.
Ms. Martinez has shepherded legislation creating a letter-grading system for the state's schools, and last week she scored a victory when the New Mexico House approved a budget that includes a merit-pay system for teachers, another element of her sweeping overhaul efforts. Still, New Mexico has lingered in the bottom five states in student achievement, even though it ranks 18th in the country in per-pupil spending.
Despite her efforts to diversify the economy, the state registered year-over-year job losses every month since June -- the worst record in the nation, according to estimates from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Ms. Martinez is promoting a $65 million package that includes tax credits for small businesses for each worker hired and retained, and a business tax cut of almost three percentage points so New Mexico's rate would match that of neighboring Arizona. But leaders in the Legislature's Democratic majority say the proposal does not go far enough.
There is a lot of bad blood circulating in the Legislature this year after a combative campaign season, fueled in large part by stinging ads focused on incumbents who stood in the way of legislation the governor supported.
The effort to repeal the driver's license law drove a wedge in a body that is usually collegial. Last year, Ms. Martinez's political action committee, Susana PAC, attacked two top Democrats, Timothy Jennings, the Senate president pro tem, and Michael Sanchez, the Senate majority leader, for supporting the 2003 law that allowed illegal immigrants to obtain a driver's license.
Mr. Jennings lost his bid for re-election. Mr. Sanchez won. Harvey E. Yates Jr., who was the state Republican chairman when Ms. Martinez was elected and is known for calling things as he sees them, told New Mexico In Depth, an online journalism organization, that her administration had been ''a divisive force rather than a uniting force'' in the way it handled the Legislature.
State Representative Antonio Maestas, an Albuquerque Democrat and the House majority whip, said in an interview that the candidates the governor opposed but who won nonetheless had arrived at the Roundhouse, the state's circular Capitol, ''emboldened.''
''Being the first Hispanic governor in a state that takes pride in its Hispanic heritage could have been a powerful force in bringing people together,'' Mr. Maestas said. ''She chose instead to pander to the anti-immigrant sentiment in her party, and that's her record.''
Mr. Smith, the conservative Democrat, and State Senator Stuart Ingle of Portales, the Republican minority leader and main sponsor of the license bill, originally wanted to propose a system like Utah's, where citizens and legal residents get regular driver's licenses and illegal immigrants get driver's permits. But once they brought the governor into the discussion, ''it became clear she wasn't going to go for it,'' Mr. Ingle said.
A competing bill that tightens residency requirements to prevent fraud while still allowing illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses has also been introduced. Ms. Martinez has said that if it passed, she would not sign it into law.
Mr. Ingle, for his part, did not sound too confident about his bill's fate, saying, ''We'll see where it goes.''
Ms. Martinez says that keeping illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses is a matter of public safety. ''We're not deporting anyone,'' she said.
She has high approval ratings: 64 percent over all and 56 percent among Hispanics, according to a Colorado College survey released this month.
Despite polls suggesting that most New Mexicans support ending driving privileges for illegal immigrants, the issue is sure to fuel debate as Ms. Martinez travels around the country. The question, however, is whether it will matter more to Latinos than her record on job creation and education, or whether it is her personality and personal history that will shape their opinions.
''What she's intending to do is craft a message of inclusion, and just in doing that she's already separating herself from the extreme rhetoric in the Republican Party,'' said Christine Sierra, the director of the Southwest Hispanic Research Institute at the University of New Mexico.
It is a ''calculated gamble,'' Professor Sierra said, but whether it will work ''is a book that has yet to be written.''

HEADLINE: In Impasse, New York Would Face Steep Cuts

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- New York, New Jersey and Connecticut face steep reductions in federal aid for education, childhood vaccinations, military operations, environmental protection and other programs if President Obama and Congress fail to reach agreement on a plan to avert a looming series of across-the-board cuts in spending. 
Nationwide, $85 billion in cuts will automatically go into effect on Friday, with many domestic programs facing reductions of as much as 9 percent and military programs being reduced by 13 percent over the rest of the federal fiscal year.
For New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, that means reductions totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to popular programs, according to a state-by-state document that the White House released on Sunday in an effort to apply pressure on Congressional Republicans as both sides appear to be deadlocked over how to avert the automatic cuts, known as sequester.
Some of the biggest reductions will be to financing for primary and secondary education, with New York set to lose about $42 million, New Jersey nearly $12 million and Connecticut nearly $9 million. The cuts, according to the White House's estimate, would jeopardize nearly 900 teaching and classroom aide positions in all three states.
Steep cuts would also be made to environmental programs, including those aimed at maintaining water and air quality. New York would see its environmental financing cut by nearly $13 million, while New Jersey would lose about $5 million and Connecticut $2 million.
The three states would also face nearly $1 million in curtailments to programs providing vaccinations to children against diseases like mumps, rubella, tetanus, measles, whooping cough, hepatitis B and influenza. If enacted, the cutbacks would mean that 12,670 fewer children would be receiving vaccinations in all three states, according to the White House estimate.
The reductions would affect military installations in all three states. Roughly 11,000 civilian Department of Defense employees would be furloughed in New Jersey, 12,000 in New York and 3,000 in Connecticut. The furloughs could amount to about $151 million in lost pay, according to the administration's estimate.
Programs providing meals for older people would also be hit. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut would face about $2.1 million in cuts to such programs, the White House estimated.
New York and Connecticut would lose $1.1 million from programs that help find jobs for unemployed people. The White House estimates that the decrease would mean that nearly 15,000 unemployed individuals would go without this service.
Democrats had hoped that the prospect of the reductions -- particularly to the Pentagon -- would force Republicans into accepting a deal that would include specific spending cuts and tax increases. Yet Republicans have signaled that they have no interest in accepting tax increases, even if that means allowing the automatic cuts to go into effect.
Many Republicans say that they already made significant concessions in the area of taxes during the last budget standoff, when their party agreed to $600 billion in tax increases as part of a deal struck on New Year's Eve.

HEADLINE: Panel on Health Care Work Force, Lacking a Budget, Is Left Waiting

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One of the biggest threats to the success of President Obama's health care law comes from shortages of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals. But a 15-member commission created to investigate the problem has never met in two and a half years because it has no money from Congress or the administration.
''It's like 'Waiting for Godot,' '' said Dr. Richard D. Krugman, the dean of the University of Colorado Medical School and a member of the commission. ''We are sitting on a park bench, waiting for Godot. We'll see if he shows up.'' 
With an aging population and 30 million people expected to gain coverage under Mr. Obama's health care law, the demand for medical care is expected to increase. But Dr. Sheldon M. Retchin, the vice chairman of the panel, the National Health Care Workforce Commission, said, ''We are prohibited from meeting and discussing these issues.''
Members of the independent nonpartisan panel said they wanted to address these questions: How many more doctors are needed? What is the right mix of primary care physicians and specialists? Who will care for the millions of people gaining Medicaid coverage next year?
Should states rewrite their laws to allow nurse practitioners and physician assistants to do more of the work done by doctors? Could pharmacists play a larger role in coordinating care and managing the use of medications?
The commission was created by the 2010 health care law, the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Obama has requested $3 million for the panel in each of the last two years, and some Democrats, like Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on health, have supported the request.
But Republicans in Congress have been reluctant to provide money for anything connected with the law, which they opposed. ''Anything authorized in the Affordable Care Act has a tough road with the Republicans,'' said Dr. Atul Grover, the chief lobbyist for the Association of American Medical Colleges.
The chairman of the commission, Peter I. Buerhaus, a professor of nursing at Vanderbilt University, said: ''It's a disappointing situation. The nation's health care work force has many problems that are not being attended to. These problems were apparent before health care reform, and they will be even more pressing after health care reform.''
Dr. Krugman said the commission was ''caught in a broader political struggle, and in the gridlock between Congress and the administration.''
Dr. Retchin, who is the senior vice president for health sciences at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said ''the government needs to analyze the scope, caliber and composition of the health care work force'' because labor costs accounted for a large share of the nation's health care bill.
Members of the panel, appointed in September 2010 by the comptroller general of the United States, have no staff, no budget and no agenda.
Kim J. Gillan, the director of the work force training program at Montana State University Billings, said federal officials had made clear to her and other panel members that ''we were not to function as a group or have contact with one another.''
Ms. Gillan said some people apparently feared that the commission might recommend the national licensing of health care professionals or other steps that could interfere with state prerogatives.
Another panel member, Prof. Thomas C. Ricketts of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, had advised the panel that ''we were not to work or be seen to be working.''
Dr. Krugman said, ''We were told that we were to have no conversations until we were funded because that would be a violation of some federal law or rule.''
Chuck Young, a spokesman for the accountability office, said, ''Agencies generally cannot conduct business without an appropriation.''
In a summary of research, the Department of Health and Human Services said, ''The United States faces shortages of primary care physicians, dentists, nurses and other health professionals.''
Roger J. Moncarz, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that employment in health care occupations was expected to grow by 29 percent, with the addition of 3.5 million new jobs from 2010 to 2020. Federal officials expect 712,000 new jobs for registered nurses -- more than for any other occupation in the country -- and a total of 1.3 million new jobs for home health and personal care aides, he said.
Edward S. Salsberg, the director of the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis at the Health and Human Services Department, said 57 million people were living in areas with shortages of primary care practitioners.

HEADLINE: On Portugal Beach, Riding a Wave That Hits Like a Quake

BYLINE: By MAÏA de la BAUME

 BODY:
NAZARÉ, Portugal -- The big ones typically come only once a year, in the winter. Whipped up by powerful storms in the North Atlantic, they roll for days toward Europe, rising to seemingly impossible heights before crashing on the shores of Praia do Norte, a beach along the Portuguese coast just north of this picturesque fishing town.
''It is like an earthquake,'' said Pedro Pisco, a city hall administrator from this old fishing port, a few miles away from Praia do Norte. ''When it breaks, you can feel the earth shaking under your feet.'' 
The area has a reputation as a dangerous spot for its turbulent gales, crushing surf and frequent accidents, though on a recent day the sea was flat as a reflecting pool. Normally, though, the waves crash on shore with a special power, and for years residents were not even sure they were safe to surf.
Despite its charm and a stunning 14th-century church, Nazaré has seen some bad times, with the decline of its once-prosperous fishing industry and an exodus of local youth. And that was before the euro crisis and the deep slump in the Portuguese economy.
But thanks to a photo that electrified the world last month -- showing a big-wave surfer named Garrett McNamara setting a world record by streaking down the face of an estimated 100-foot breaker -- the city is now busily trying to cash in on its moment of fame to promote itself and its now famous beach, Praia do Norte, as a pre-eminent big wave surfing spot.
The waves here have long been compared to invincible enemies, killing fishermen, vacationers and frequently inundating streets and shops. There is even a spot called ''the reef of widows,'' where by legend the wives of fishermen would watch their husbands drowning after waves had destroyed their boats.
The town is still filled with widows wearing black dresses or the traditional seven layers of multicolored petticoats and long socks. A local legend says that women wore seven skirts because while waiting for their husbands to sail home, they would count seven waves until the sea would calm down.
Dino Casimiro, a 35-year-old body-boarder from Nazaré, is an ardent admirer of the waves and one of the major initiators of the city's image makeover.
''For many years, we didn't know if the waves were surfable or not,'' said Mr. Casimiro, a physical education teacher in several local schools. ''They were too big.''
In 2010, with the town's big-wave fame spreading, several of the biggest names in surfing -- including Mr. McNamara, who lives in Hawaii, and Kelly Slater, Shane Dorian and Tiago Pires, the Portuguese surf champion -- came to Praia do Norte. ''Praia do Norte is the best secret in the world,'' Mr. McNamara said by telephone from Hawaii. ''There is nowhere in the world where you can be so close to the giant waves.''
The project, called the ''Zon North Canyon show'' and developed with Mr. McNamara, was aimed at promoting him as well as the town. It was sponsored by Zon, Portugal's main media holding company, after Mr. McNamara broke his first world record here by surfing a 78-foot wave.
Then last month Mr. McNamara spent about 30 seconds on the face of a giant wave still spoken of with awe by other surfers. ''It was like riding a mountain, like snowboarding down a giant mountain,'' he said.
There are big wave spots far from land, like Cortes Bank 100 miles west of San Diego, Calif. But there are very few in coastal areas, because the gently sloping continental shelf normally flattens out the giants, gradually sapping their strength before they can reach land. But this small part of the Portuguese coast sits at the end of a giant funnel called the ''canyon of Nazaré,'' 130 miles long and 16,000 feet deep (at its deepest), that points like an arrow toward the town.
The canyon, said Luis Quaresma, an oceanographer at the Lisbon-based Instituto Hidrografico, creates ''a highway for the swell,'' which arrives with a lot of energy, very close to the beach. ''While the waves here are almost always imposing, local people say, occasionally -- on average, once a year -- a few swells of almost unimaginable height will roll in,'' he said.
As a child, Mr. Casimiro says he would look at the waves almost every day from the 16th-century fortress and its lighthouse set atop a cliff overlooking Praia do Norte. ''Just looking at the waves scares you,'' he said. ''They are very strong, powerful and hollow.''
In 2005, he bought a camera, took pictures of the most impressive waves at Praia do Norte and sent one to Mr. McNamara, who he knew only from the Internet.
''Garrett called me at 3 a.m. once,'' Mr. Casimiro said. ''He had seen the forecast.''
The swells are picked up by a midocean buoy several days before they come ashore, enabling big-wave surfers like Mr. McNamara to scramble to Nazaré in time to catch them. In recent years, Mr. McNamara has caught high waves in places like Tahiti, Hawaii and even on the coast of south-central Alaska, where he surfed tsunami waves formed by calving glaciers.
But Nazaré, he said, holds a special place in his heart. ''It's a place for everybody to go enjoy, it doesn't matter if you surf or not,'' he said.
Here, in a town that welcomed Vasco da Gama before and after his trip to India more than 500 years ago, Mr. McNamara is considered a modern hero of the sea.
Some days, when he surfs Praia do Norte, the children of the local school interrupt classes to watch him streaking down the breathtakingly high mountains of dark water.
In April, Mr. McNamara and the city will inaugurate a ''High Performance Center'' to teach people the dangers of the sea and to promote surfing and environmental protection.
Mr. Pisco, the city administrator, also plans to turn the fortress and its adjoining lighthouse into a museum of the big wave with a panoramic viewpoint.
From this particular spot, Mr. Pisco said, ''you see the giant wave forming off in the distance and then growing little by little,'' he said. ''In a matter of a few minutes, it breaks like an explosion.''

HEADLINE: Budget Impasse Signals a Shift in G.O.P.'s Focus

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With Congress unlikely to stop deep automatic spending cuts that will strike hard at the military, the fiscal stalemate is highlighting a significant shift in the Republican Party: lawmakers most keenly dedicated to shrinking the size of government are now more dominant than the bloc committed foremost to a robust national defense, particularly in the House.
That reality also underscores what Republicans, and some Democrats, say was a major miscalculation on the part of President Obama. He agreed to set up the automatic cuts 18 months ago because he believed the threat of sharp reductions in military spending would be enough to force Republicans to agree to a deficit reduction plan that included the tax increases he favored.
''Fiscal questions trump defense in a way they never would have after 9/11,'' said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. ''But the war in Iraq is over. Troops are coming home from Afghanistan, and we want to secure the cuts.'' 
Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and one of the lawmakers Democrats had hoped would never accept the military cuts, went almost as far. ''Republicans aren't cookie cutter,'' he said, ''but we do agree on the basic premise of where we're trying to go. And if we don't get our fiscal house in order, it's very hard to provide for the defense of the nation.''
As lawmakers prepared to return to Washington, the White House tried to raise the ante by highlighting the effects the cuts would have on programs in every state.
But at the heart of the battle over sequestration -- the nearly $1 trillion in budget cuts that are scheduled to begin on Friday and accelerate over the next decade -- are fundamental misunderstandings between the two parties over their respective priorities.
During the 2011 negotiations to raise the nation's statutory borrowing limit, Mr. Obama wanted an onerous ''trigger'' to force both sides to reach a compromise on deficit reduction. For Democrats, the bludgeon that would drive them to negotiate changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security would be cuts to domestic programs like child nutrition and national parks. For Republicans, the president wanted automatic tax increases to force a compromise on the broader tax code.
Republicans balked, but offered what Mr. Obama thought was a different Republican sacred cow -- military cuts.
Ultimately, taxes trumped all of that. Republicans, who last month let taxes rise on incomes over $400,000 to avert broader tax increases and the ''fiscal cliff,'' are now ready to stand their ground, regardless of the military cuts.
''I really think they misunderstood what happened on the fiscal cliff,'' Mr. Cole said. ''They thought they had Republicans on the run, when all they did was push us to high ground. All the muskets are pointing out. You want to charge the hill? Come on.''
But the Republicans were surprised by Democrats, who would not shift the automatic domestic cuts to entitlement programs unless the people least affected by government support -- the rich -- also bore some of the burden.
''We always thought it wouldn't happen because the other side wouldn't stomach the nondefense reductions,'' said Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican and a leading voice among House conservatives. ''I guess what happened was each side was too smart for the other.''
Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said on Sunday that there was no miscalculation. In the final months of last year's presidential campaign, Republicans ''racked up a lot of frequent flier miles booking flights to Virginia'' to denounce the coming military cuts, he said. If Republican leaders would step out of the way, he said, rank-and-file Republicans most worried about the military cuts would step forward to compromise on taxes.
A sizable number of Republicans, including many senators, are incensed by the cuts about to fall on the Pentagon, totaling $43 billion for the 2013 fiscal year. Because the Defense Department will have only seven months to put them into effect and because military personnel are protected, military training, weapons acquisition and maintenance stand to be cut by 13 percent.
President Ronald Reagan's push in the 1980s for tax cuts and domestic spending restraint were accompanied by a huge military buildup. ''There's no way the party of Ronald Reagan should be accepting these cuts,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has privately sought some compromise on tax loopholes.
Writing in the conservative Weekly Standard, William Kristol, a Republican hawk, excoriated Republicans for being ''so desperate for a 'victory' over Obama'' that they were ''willing to sacrifice national defense for minor cuts in domestic spending which will in no way fundamentally change our trajectory toward national insolvency.''
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called the cuts ''unconscionable'' on the CNN program ''State of the Union'' on Sunday.
But most Congressional Republicans are standing their ground, a position they say is strategic. The federal government's growing debt cannot be controlled through the spending at the annual discretion of Congress, and after the cuts take effect, that part of the federal budget will drop to levels not seen in five decades as measured against the size of the economy. Long term, the problem is entitlements, especially Medicare and Social Security.
The pain of further cuts to discretionary programs could bring Mr. Obama to the negotiating table on them by the spring, if not by midsummer, when Congress must once again raise the government's borrowing limit.
''Because the Democratic-controlled Senate and the president refuse to negotiate, the only way to potentially bring them to the table to negotiate is to go forward with the spending reductions as they are,'' Mr. Price said.
With so many rank-and-file Republicans adamant that they would rather see the cuts stand than raise any taxes, Speaker John A. Boehner finds himself in a bind. Three times this year -- on the tax deal to resolve the fiscal cliff, on a measure to suspend the debt ceiling and on a package of Hurricane Sandy relief -- he has let legislation pass the House against the votes of a majority of Republicans. In 2011, Republicans accepted caps on military spending as well.
Each time, the speaker has promised to stand his ground on the next showdown with the president. That showdown comes this week.
Representative Tom Cotton of Arkansas, an Iraq War veteran with combat experience and a rising Republican star, said that the speaker was in a ''very tough position'' in one-on-one negotiations with the president, and that the opportunity for a grand bargain was gone.

HEADLINE: A Costly and Unjust Perk for Financiers

BYLINE: By LYNN FORESTER de ROTHSCHILD. 
Lynn Forester de Rothschild is the chief executive of E. L. Rothschild, a family-owned investment holding company.

 BODY:
OF the many injustices that permeate America's byzantine tax code, few are as outrageous as the tax rate on ''carried interest'' -- the profits made by private equity and hedge fund managers, as well as venture capitalists and partners in real estate investment trusts. This huge tax benefit enriches an already privileged sliver of financiers and violates basic standards of fairness and common sense.
President Obama recently suggested that he would ask Congress to close this loophole. Eliminating the carried-interest tax rate should be an easy sell. It should play to Republicans' supposed hatred of government handouts and to Democrats' commitment to social justice. 
But because of the financial lobby's clout, the loophole most likely won't be closed. If it isn't, shame on both parties for giving us another reason to distrust our democracy and our capitalist system.
While the tax legislation passed on Jan. 1 increased the top individual-income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for couples making more than $450,000 and individuals making more than $400,000, it left carried-interest income taxed at just 20 percent.
Carried interest is taxed at ordinary capital-gains rates, rather than at the significantly higher ordinary income-tax rates that apply to the wealthiest Americans. The issue came up last year, because Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, had made much of his fortune through private equity.
This special tax treatment for carried interest protects the general partners of private equity, venture capital, real estate, hedge funds and other investment vehicles organized as limited partnerships. (The investment-holding company I run does not receive carried-interest income.)
Millions of general partners in investment funds receive carried-interest income when they earn profits for their clients. Since these partners do not have to risk any of their own capital, carried interest is really a taxpayer-subsidized fee for managing their clients' money -- often 20 percent of the profits generated in the fund, and sometimes significantly more than that.
No other affluent Americans enjoy this benefit. A brain surgeon, stockbroker, corporate lawyer or actor will have to pay the new top marginal rate percent, while a general partner who manages other people's money pays, on carried-interest income, only the 20 percent rate on long-term capital gains.
This discrepancy dates from 1922, when the top ordinary-income tax rate was 58 percent and capital gains were taxed at 12.5 percent -- a big change from the years 1918 to 1921, when both kinds of income were taxed, in the top bracket, at 77 percent. But the amount of lost government revenue has widened significantly since 2000 as a result of the growth of nontraditional finance.
Although the industry keeps a close lid on the total amounts, experts have estimated that there are more than 1,400 private equity and venture capital funds, which collectively manage more than $1 trillion in limited-partnership equity investments and earn an average of $18 billion a year on them that is taxed as carried interest. There are also 8,000 or 9,000 hedge funds managing about the same amount of these investments generating another $18 billion in carried-interest income. And let's not forget the 1.2 million real estate partnerships, with more than $1.3 trillion in limited-partnership investments, which yield a further $20 billion each year in such income. The difference in revenue to the United States government when this combined income is taxed at 20 percent rather than at 39.6 percent is about $11 billion annually. Indeed, the Real Estate Roundtable, a leading industry lobbying group, puts the estimate even higher, at $13 billion -- $5 billion in real estate alone.
The first legislative effort to treat carried interest like ordinary income was a bill submitted by Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, in 2007. Annual spending by the private equity, hedge fund and real estate industry lobbies exploded in that year. Predictably, the legislation has been shelved or voted down repeatedly ever since. Although Mr. Obama paid lip service to the removal of the preferential treatment for carried interest during both of his presidential campaigns, he has yet to achieve it.
This state of affairs denies our Treasury much-needed revenue; fuels public cynicism in government; and is evidence of the ''crony capitalism'' that favors some economic sectors over others. When plutocrats join with both parties to protect their own vested interests, the result is a corrosion of confidence in the free-market system.
The carried-interest loophole may seem small compared with this year's projected $900 billion deficit, but ending it would be a major signal that Washington is ready to put an end to business as usual.

HEADLINE: As BP Trial Nears, Hints Of Progress On a Deal

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- As settlement talks continued Sunday on the eve of a trial against BP stemming from the 2010 explosion of a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the details of an offer by federal and state officials to the oil company started to emerge.
The plan, worth a total of $16 billion, would limit the fines paid by BP under the Clean Water Act to $6 billion, a proposal that could help reduce its tax liability, said one person briefed on the plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
BP would also pay $9 billion in penalties to cover damages to natural resources as well as the cost of restoration, that person said. The remaining $1 billion would be set aside in a fund that could be tapped if unanticipated environmental damages related to the spill developed.
No one at BP, the Justice Department or the states involved has commented on any settlement proposal, but several lawyers briefed on the negotiations said that a $16 billion proposal had been made. The affected states are Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, although only Alabama and Louisiana are participating in the trial.
Even if settlement talks slow or stall, the proposal represents a big breakthrough for several reasons, lawyers briefed on the talks said. For one, it represents the first time that Louisiana, which was hardest hit by the spill and would receive the largest payout of any state from a settlement, has participated in an offer.
In addition, the proposal signals the first agreement among states and the federal government on two other crucial issues: a rough plan for how the states would divide any settlement money, and how the settlement would balance fines and penalties against BP.
In any deal, BP would want to pay penalties as opposed to fines, because penalty payments, like those that cover damages to natural resources, are tax-deductible, while payments for fines, like those for Clean Water Act violations, are not.
All parties said they were prepared to go to trial. On Sunday evening, it appeared that opening arguments would proceed, though Judge Carl J. Barbier of Federal District Court in New Orleans could delay them if parties in the case told him that settlement talks were progressing.
The first phase of the trial, which was expected to last three months, will determine whether BP or its contractors were ''grossly negligent'' in causing the accident, which killed 11 workers and soiled hundreds of miles of beaches from Louisiana to Florida. The accident occurred when a drilling rig leased by BP, the Deepwater Horizon, exploded, causing an estimated four million barrels of oil to spill.
If Judge Barbier were to find BP grossly negligent, the company could face fines of up to $17.6 billion under the Clean Water Act. If the company and its contractors were found to have acted ''negligently,'' a less-severe standard, the per-barrel fines would be only one-quarter of that, or some $4 billion. The higher fine would also require that Judge Barbier agree with the government that four million barrels of oil spilled into the gulf. BP says the estimate is exaggerated.
In time, the company will also be assessed penalties under a separate federal statute, for environmental damages and remediation costs. Estimates of those penalties range widely, from $5 billion to $20 billion, with some projections estimating current costs and higher ones reflecting potential future effects on the gulf, lawyers said.
One reason for the states' difficulty in shaping an offer has been their disagreement over how the money would be paid. Some states, like Florida, prefer to see the company pay more in economic damages because those would give the states greater flexibility in spending the payouts. Payments for pollution-related penalties typically must be used for environmental purposes.
There are strong reasons for all sides to reach a deal. Blaine LeCesne, a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans, said payments could flow faster, and it would be costly to proceed with a trial only to have it interrupted by a settlement or partial settlement later. A settlement would also avert future appeals. For BP, a settlement could avert months of bad publicity coming out of a trial that could include embarrassing testimony and documents retelling the story of the accident.
But Mr. LeCesne added that progress had been slow because ''there are too many diverse claimants with varying interests and varying litigation perspectives.''
Left unresolved by the current settlement proposal are claims by the affected Gulf Coast states against BP for economic damages, which could account for billions of dollars more.
As part of the trial scheduled to start Monday, Transocean, the owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon rig, and Halliburton, which was responsible for pouring the cement plugs in the well, also face possible civil penalties.
The fallout from the spill has dealt a punishing blow to BP, forcing it to divest valuable oil and gas fields around the world over the last three years to set aside $42 billion in payments. It has already spent more than $14 billion on spill response and cleanup, and nearly $10 billion in payments to affected local governments, businesses and individuals.
BP pleaded guilty last year to 14 criminal charges, including manslaughter; admitted negligence in misreading important tests before the blowout; and agreed to pay $4.5 billion in fines and other penalties. The Justice Department has also filed criminal charges against four BP employees.
Last February, a trial to resolve claims against BP by individuals and businesses affected by the spill was delayed by Judge Barbier on the eve of trial because of settlement talks. BP subsequently agreed to create a fund now valued at $8.5 billion to settle those claims. However, numerous individuals and businesses chose not to participate and are also parties to the trial starting Monday.

HEADLINE: Adults Are Flocking to College That Paved Way for Flexibility

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
In September, Jennifer Hunt of Brown County, Ind., was awarded a bachelor's degree from Thomas Edison State College in New Jersey without ever taking a Thomas Edison course. She was one of about 300 of last year's 3,200 graduates who managed to patch together their degree requirements with a mix of credits -- from other institutions, standardized exams, online courses, workplace or military training programs and portfolio assessments.
Years ago, fresh out of high school, Ms. Hunt had finished enough advanced work to enter the University of Texas at Austin with sophomore standing. But after a year, homesick, she returned to Virginia. Then she married and eventually moved to Indiana. She had 10 children, whom she home-schools, and worked in her husband's business.
About a year ago, at 39, she resolved to complete a degree. In a kind of a higher-education sprint, she took a number of college equivalency exams, earning 54 credits in 14 weeks. 
''I tried to do an exam a week at the University of Indianapolis test center,'' where the exams could be proctored, she said. ''Each test cost about $80.''
Ms. Hunt estimated that her degree in business administration, plus a simultaneous associate degree in applied science, had cost her $5,300, including books and fees. There are almost as many routes to a Thomas Edison degree as there are students. In a way, that is the whole point of the college, a fully accredited, largely online public institution in Trenton founded in 1972 to provide a flexible way for adults to further their education.
''We don't care how or where the student learned, whether it was from spending three years in a monastery,'' said George A. Pruitt, the college's president, ''as long as that learning is documented by some reliable assessment technique.''
''Learning takes place continuously throughout our lives,'' he said. ''If you're a success in the insurance industry, and you're in the million-dollar round table, what difference does it make if you learned your skills at Prudential or at Wharton?''
At a time when student debt has passed $1 trillion, such institutions seem to have, at the very least, impeccable timing. Thomas Edison, New Jersey's second-largest public college, and two like-minded institutions -- Charter Oak State College in Connecticut and the private, nonprofit Excelsior College in New York -- are all growing. Thomas Edison's graduating class last fall was a third bigger than the class five years earlier. And the idea of measuring students' competency, not classroom hours, has become the cornerstone of newer institutions like Western Governors University in Utah.
At Thomas Edison and the other such colleges, almost all students are over 21, many are in the military, and few have taken a direct path to higher education.
Pilar Mercedes Foy, 31, a Thomas Edison graduate whose parents did not go to college, said after she got an entry-level job at PSEG, the New Jersey energy company, she realized that she would need a degree to advance. She earned the bulk of her credits through heavily subsidized evening classes offered at work, supplemented by classes at Union County College and 12 credits from the CLEP Spanish exam. For her, earning a degree without taking on a penny of student debt was enough of a milestone that she invited her husband, parents, siblings, in-laws and nieces to the September graduation ceremony.
Thirty years ago, when Dr. Pruitt became president, the Thomas Edison approach was controversial. Some academics, in particular, were skeptical, he said, almost believing that ''if we didn't teach it to you, you couldn't have learned it.''
Results have quieted most naysayers, Dr. Pruitt said. For example, Thomas Edison graduates had the highest pass rate on the exam for certified public accountants in New Jersey, in the latest national accounting-boards report. Still, the approach raises real questions about the meaning of a college degree.
''If I'm giving you a degree, I'm vouching for you, testifying to your competence,'' said Clifford Adelman, a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy in Washington. ''With these nomad students in higher education, whose students are they? There are questions of ownership and ethical responsibility.''
Most Thomas Edison students arrive with some credits, at times earned many years earlier. Others get credits by submitting a portfolio of their work or passing standardized exams like the College Level Examination Program, administered by the College Board. Many complete online college courses from Thomas Edison or ''open courseware'' sources like the Saylor Foundation. Many bring transcripts from the American Council on Education's credit recommendation program, certifying their nontraditional programs.
Arthur C. Brooks, a former economics professor at Syracuse who heads the American Enterprise Institute, earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Thomas Edison in 1994, at age 30, after a decade as a musician. He took correspondence courses, he said, ''at the cheapest places I could find.''
Mr. Brooks believes he did the same homework, wrote the same papers and took the same tests as on-campus students at other colleges, without meeting a single professor. To get his degree, he had to prove mastery of economics in a two-hour telephone conversation with a professor at Pace University.
''It was like a field exam,'' said Mr. Brooks, now 48. ''He asked about Adam Smith, John Keynes, supply and demand, macro and micro -- everything an economics major at any university would be expected to know.''
David Esterson, 45, of Whittier, Calif., started taking college classes while in high school, attended the University of Washington for a year, was a photographer in Los Angeles, then started a music business. About three years ago, when his nephews began talking about college, Mr. Esterson decided he should complete his degree.
He took online courses at the University of Minnesota and the University of Phoenix before trying a couple of California community colleges and an acupuncture school. He finally earned a bachelor's degree in liberal studies from Thomas Edison in September.
''It sounded like a scam, but the fact that it was a state school, and accredited, made it more real,'' Mr. Esterson said.
And it has been real, he said: ''Nobody I contacted about graduate programs seemed to look down on the Edison degree, and I got into every grad school I applied to.''
Now enrolled in two graduate programs -- an online master's in leadership at Northeastern and a dual-degree executive M.B.A. program from Cornell University and Queen's University in Canada -- Mr. Esterson is a booster for his alma mater. ''I've never been there, but I did buy a sweatshirt,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Complex Role for Medicare in the Standoff in Washington

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In some ways, the partisan standoff over looming budget cuts resembles earlier links in the chain of fiscal battles that began two years ago.
But the politics of one core dispute between Democrats and Republicans -- what to do about Medicare -- are changing. And some of those changes complicate President Obama's agenda, even as he continues to flex his postelection muscle.
One shift is the shrinking magnitude of the Medicare spending problem -- a consequence, at least for now, of a recent slowdown in the rise of health care costs. That diminishes the willingness of Congressional Democrats, and perhaps the administration, too, to accept the sort of Medicare curbs that Mr. Obama has indicated that he favors. 
Another is a moderation in the public stance of Republican leaders. In recent weeks, they have advocated smaller changes to Medicare than the ''premium support'' or voucher plan that Mitt Romney advocated and that Mr. Obama denounced in last year's presidential campaign.
As a result, Mr. Obama's ability to deliver a bipartisan compromise on entitlement spending may be waning even as Republicans edge closer to one.
The reduction in Medicare spending levels is the more drastic change.
In August 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicare would cost $6.5 trillion from 2012 to 2020. A few months later, a deficit reduction panel appointed by Mr. Obama called those spending levels unsustainable.
But the budget office's latest projections have pegged Medicare spending over the same period at $6.1 trillion. That $400 billion decline exceeds the $303 billion in savings over that period recommended in 2010 by the panel, which was led by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican, and Erskine B. Bowles, who served as a chief of staff under President Bill Clinton.
The causes of the decline, which could include the impact of a weak economy as well as adjustments by doctors and hospitals to policy changes in the 2010 health care law, remain unclear. As does the decline's duration.
Even so, Harold M. Ickes, a longtime Democratic strategist and a veteran of Mr. Clinton's White House, said that ''it's going to be a hard case to make among Democrats that entitlements should be cut'' as long as that trend persisted.
Yet no one argues that the deceleration in health costs has resolved the looming fiscal squeeze caused by the aging of the baby boom generation. Among the more optimistic liberal economists, Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research argues that the trend, if it continues, will eventually resolve 75 percent of the long-term budget challenge posed by Medicare.
Mr. Obama, in calling for a ''grand bargain'' budget deal with Republicans, has repeatedly invoked the need to curb entitlement spending. And he has said he would consider changes beyond the roughly $300 billion in Medicare spending reductions proposed in last year's budget.
But lately the administration has backed away from the idea of raising Medicare's eligibility age, which Mr. Obama entertained in 2011 negotiations with Speaker John A. Boehner. Democratic policy experts say his willingness to bargain beyond existing public proposals may be ebbing.
''It's not clear to me how he goes much further,'' said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''We have some time to examine the progress we've made and whether we can continue it. There's a little more oxygen in the room.''
Such reluctance worries Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bowles, who last week issued a new call for $600 billion in savings from Medicare, Medicaid and other health care programs. ''Any time you have an excuse not to make a cut in Washington, you take it,'' Mr. Bowles said.
That could, in turn, sour prospects for an accord on Medicare just as Republicans shift toward a less confrontational stance.
Like Mr. Romney, House Republicans have pressed for shifting Medicare from an open-ended commitment to one that offers a fixed amount for each beneficiary. The president and his party have harshly criticized that approach for shifting financial risk from the government to retirees; Mr. Bowles, too, calls it ''a step too far.''
Republicans have shown concern about the political risks by postponing their plan to carry out that idea to spare current beneficiaries and those who are within 10 years of enrolling in Medicare. But lately they have displayed even more caution.
Mr. Boehner did not demand premium support in negotiations with Mr. Obama over the ''fiscal cliff'' late last year. And in a recent speech intended to improve the Republican Party's image, the House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, highlighted a less controversial way to ''modernize Medicare,'' by combining its separate hospital and doctor services benefits with ''reasonable and predictable levels of out-of-pocket expenses.''
In internal budget negotiations, House Republicans are now weighing the need to broaden their political appeal as well as to find more immediate budget cuts to meet Mr. Boehner's pledge to eliminate the deficit within 10 years. Unless they rapidly accelerate implementation of ''premium support,'' the idea will not help on either count.
''We are rethinking,'' said Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who is on the Budget Committee.
Although the Budget Committee's chairman, Representative Paul D. Ryan, who was Mr. Romney's running mate, strongly backs premium support, ''it isn't realistic while Obama's president,'' said Yuval Levin, a former domestic policy adviser to President George W. Bush. ''It makes sense for them to try to see what incremental steps can be taken.''
The Simpson-Bowles commission estimated that a shift of the sort that Mr. Cantor discussed could save $110 billion through 2020. Paul Starr, a Princeton professor and co-founder of the liberal magazine The American Prospect, has called the Simpson-Bowles version ''pretty good'' ideas and said Democrats ''should not reject them out of hand'' even though they would affect beneficiaries.
Republicans could press for other sources of Medicare savings that would be difficult for Democrats to resist. Both the deficit reduction panel and Mr. Starr have said the government could save $60 billion or more over 10 years by reducing the amount Medicare pays hospitals to educate medical residents.
The Obama administration has proposed saving only a small portion of that amount, largely in deference to the influence of teaching hospitals and their Congressional backers in Democratic-leaning states like California, Massachusetts and New York. If Republicans heighten scrutiny of those payments, Democrats may find their resistance harder to defend than their opposition to benefit cuts.

HEADLINE: What Investment Are You Willing to Make to Get Your Dream Job?

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: What sacrifices does your dream job require before you land it? 

 BODY:
 The road to many careers starts with a serious investment: an education that takes time, energy and tuition payments. 
What is your dream career? Does it require an up-front commitment on your part in terms of education or other training?

In "High Debt and Falling Demand Trap New Vets," David Segal writes about the challenges faced by many new veterinarians: 
Hayley Schafer chose her dream job at the age of 5. Three years later, her grandmother told her that if she wrote it down, the dream would come true. So she found a piece of blue construction paper and scrawled on it with a pencil: "Veterianian." "No one told me how to spell it," she remembers. "They just said, 'Sound it out.' " 
At the age of 30, she still has the sign, which is framed on her desk at the Caring Hearts Animal Clinic in Gilbert, Ariz., where she works as a vet. She also has $312,000 in student loans, courtesy of Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Or rather, $312,000 was what she owed the last time she could bring herself to log into the Sallie Mae account that tracks the ever-growing balance.
"It makes me sick, watching it increase," she says. "There's also the stress of how am I going to save for retirement when I have this bear to pay off."
They don't teach much at veterinary school about bears, particularly the figurative kind, although debt as large and scary as any grizzly shadows most vet school grads, usually for decades. Nor is there much in the curriculum about the prospects for graduates or the current state of the profession. Neither, say many professors and doctors, looks very promising. The problem is a boom in supply (that is, vets) and a decline in demand (namely, veterinary services). Class sizes have been rising at nearly every school, in some cases by as much as 20 percent in recent years. And the cost of vet school has far outpaced the rate of inflation. It has risen to a median of $63,000 a year for out-of-state tuition, fees and living expenses, according to the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, up 35 percent in the last decade.
This would seem less alarming if vets made more money. But starting salaries have sunk by about 13 percent during the same 10-year period, in inflation-adjusted terms, to $45,575 a year, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. America may be pet-crazed and filled with people eager to buy expensive fetch toys and heated cat beds. But the total population of pets is going down, along with the sums that owners are willing to spend on the health care of their animals, one of the lesser-known casualties of the recession.
Today, the ratio of debt to income for the average new vet is roughly double that of M.D.'s, according to Malcolm Getz, an economist at Vanderbilt University. To practitioners in the field, such numbers are ominous, and they portend lean times for new graduates.
"We're calling for more bodies coming through the veterinary educational pipeline at higher and higher cost at the very point in time that we need fewer and fewer," says Dr. Eden Myers, a vet in Mount Sterling, Ky., who runs the Web site JustVetData, where she crunches numbers about the profession. "And they are going to get paid less and less."

HEADLINE: Trading More and Sharing Nicely

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Buying and selling directly with other people and sharing items you are not using can deliver important economic gains that don&#8217;t show up in conventional economic data, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
The online economy may be helping us in ways that are hard to measure. The declining cost of individual transactions increases both trading and sharing among individuals, increasing the "productivity" of consumption in ways that are underestimated by conventional indicators of economic output such as gross domestic product. 
You can increase the value of things that you own but don't use regularly in three ways: 
 Sell them online through Craigslist, eBay or similar peer-to-peer sales, with more flexibility - and less time commitment - than the traditional yard sale. These exchanges increase the utilization rate of stuff that has already been produced, but they aren't necessarily recorded as market transactions. Purchases of used goods probably displace some purchases of new goods that might otherwise take place, though they can also have the paradoxical effect of increasing the demand for new goods by increasing their long-term value. You might be more likely to buy a new commodity, for instance, if becomes easier to sell it, in turn, to someone else. 
 Rent your goods to other people through the use of online interfaces that speed transactions, help address liability and insurance problems, and provide quick publicly available feedback on the behavior of both parties. You can rent space in your home to others through services like Airbnb, rent your car through services like Wheelz or drive people around for pay as in the Lyft model. You get money; your renters get a room or transportation at a substantially lower cost than they would pay a traditional company. A recent article in Forbes on peer-to-peer rentals asserts that they will grow 25 percent this year, "moving from an income boost in a stagnant wage market into a disruptive economic force." 
 Share your goods with other people, either by giving away things you no longer use through a site like Freecycle or by participating in a reciprocity-based exchange like Couchsurfing, which connects travelers looking for places to stay with hosts interested in meeting new people. Snapgoods offers opportunities for both sharing and rental of consumer durables; NeighborGoods and Acts of Sharing match borrowers and lenders of shareable goods; and Yerdle provides a platform for giving and getting stuff from friends. 
The reciprocity-based model of "collaborative consumption" may take longer to catch on than new technologies for buying and renting, but it could have bigger effects in the long run, because it represents an especially low-cost form of exchange and it helps develop social networks that offer some intrinsic benefits. 
Anders Fremstad, a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who is planning dissertation research on this topic, has shared some of his ideas about this model with me. He observes that Couchsurfing has achieved an impressive scale, with more than 5.5 million registered Couchsurfers living in 97,000 cities across 207 countries. Compare that with the 4.9 million rooms offered by the lodging industry in the United States.
The service is successful partly because it provides an interesting social experience as well as a place to sleep. Previous empirical research shows a high level of reciprocity. Over 40 percent of people with two Couchsurfing experiences have been both surfers and hosts. Further, 12 to 18 percent of Couchsurfing stays are directly reciprocated, suggesting that they lead to new friendships. 
It seems harder to promote sharing of consumer durables, as with the NeighborGoods model (which Mr. Fremstad plans to analyze). The value of services provided by lawnmowers, vacuum cleaners and food processors is smaller relative to the costs of organizing and taking part in a sharing transaction. On the other hand, such items often sit idle most of the time. 
Many consumer durables are already shared among household members. Indeed, one reason it is cheaper to live with others than to live alone is the capacity to use household equipment, as well as space, more efficiently. But for a variety of reasons, average household size has shrunk by about half in the United States over the last 150 years, to about three people from six. This shift has increased privacy, but it has also raised living expenses. 
Further, as more women have entered employment and fertility has declined, the percentage of homes that remain largely empty during the day - along with the percentage of cars on the road with only one passenger - has almost certainly increased over time. Much of our consumption infrastructure now goes underused.
We know that the Internet has increased social networking, so it seems likely that it could encourage economic networking as well. If new sharing technologies could be combined with social scripts that make it easier for people to interact positively with others, the economy as a whole could become more productive and more environmentally sustainable. 
Prof. Yorchai Benkler of Harvard Law School describes sharing as a new mode of production that is likely to grow in importance over time. Perhaps we should call it a new mode of consumption. 
Whatever we call it, we should recognize its potential contributions to economic efficiency.

HEADLINE: Chairman of Barnes & Noble Planning Offer for Its Stores, but Not Nook

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Leonard Riggio, who built Barnes &#038; Noble into a book-selling empire, wants to buy its 689 stores and create a private company that would not have to meet Wall Street&#8217;s expectations. 

 BODY:
 7:55 p.m. | Updated 
Leonard S. Riggio has spent nearly his entire career building Barnes & Noble into the biggest name in book chains.
Now, Mr. Riggio, the company's 71-year-old chairman, is readying a bid to buy the struggling bookseller's 689 stores in an effort to save them from a stormy future in the public markets.
The plan by Mr. Riggio, disclosed in a securities filing on Monday, highlights how relentless competition from online sellers and elsewhere, which has demolished much of the traditional book-selling industry, continues to hound Barnes & Noble. 
 The move would effectively cleave the retail arm, which established itself over four decades as the industry's giant, from Nook Media, the e-book division that investors and analysts had believed would usher the retailer into the Internet era. The Nook has been beaten badly by Amazon.com's Kindle and the iPad in sales.
Earlier this month, the company's retail unit reported a 10.9 percent drop in holiday sales, while its Nook unit disclosed a 12.6 percent decrease. The retailer has said that it plans to close about 15 unprofitable stores a year, replacing them much more slowly.
While Mr. Riggio has often speculated to associates for years about potentially taking at least some of the company private, he appeared to become serious about buying its stores only in the last few weeks, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Investors appeared pleased by the prospect, as the company's shares jumped 11.5 percent on Monday, to $15.06. That values the retailer at $901.1 million - half of the roughly $1.8 billion valuation that Nook Media fetched from investors last year.
It's unclear how much Mr. Riggio would offer for the retail arm, which accounted for half of the company's second-quarter revenue. Analyst estimates of the division's worth on Monday ranged from $484.5 million to more than $1 billion.
While Barnes & Noble has weighed the possibility of selling the Nook division before, few appetizing options have materialized. An analyst at Forrester Research, James L. McQuivey, argued that the company had little ability to command a top-drawer price for its legacy business.
"Making a bet on bookstores now, when we don't know what the ultimate footprint of those stores will be, will require getting a really great price," Mr. McQuivey said.
But a person close to the company suggested that Barnes & Noble would be hard pressed to accept anything short of $1 billion.
Should Mr. Riggio make an offer, which would very likely be mostly in cash, he would face one of his biggest challenges since buying a single troubled bookshop in Manhattan and turning it into a national empire.
Mr. Riggio has watched the rise of Amazon as a lower-priced competitor, which has beaten its profits and shares down, while smaller rivals like the Borders Group eventually went out of business.
Still, he repeatedly emphasized that Barnes & Noble understood that the future lay in digital sales, and introduced the Nook in 2009 to show that it could compete with its much younger rival.
The Nook drew in as investors Microsoft and the British publisher Pearson, which collectively bought a 23 percent stake last year. And the division's various offerings have won praise from critics, some of whom recommended the devices over Amazon's.
But in three years after the first device was sold, the Nook still trails the Kindle, the iPad and other tablets. Barnes & Noble warned earlier this month that the division's losses will have grown from the previous year, not decreased.
An analyst at Credit Suisse, Gary Balter, described Nook Media in a research note on Monday as "money-losing and increasingly poorly positioned."
Analysts said that a separation of the company's businesses could make sense. Supporting the enormous costs of Nook Media has long weighed on the retail arm, and eliminating that could help profitability.
"What I suspect we are seeing is that the current management brought in to develop the Nook has been distracted from the stores," said Mike Shatzkin, the founder of Idea Logical, a media consulting firm. "And I am sure Mr. Riggio said to himself, 'I can do this better.' "
Book publishers also said that they welcome any move that would keep Barnes & Noble afloat, which would give them some negotiating leverage with Amazon over book prices. Physical bookstores also serve as a crucial way for readers to decide on new titles.
"Publishers and the public benefit from a healthy competitive market with many choices for readers who want to buy books in print or digital form," David Steinberger, the chief executive of Perseus Books Group, wrote in an e-mail. "Given the volatility of the public markets, taking this kind of business private will be a positive step for publishers and readers."
But Barnes & Noble executives are concerned that a separation could leave Nook Media cut off from the cash flow it depends on, according to the person close to the company. Any deal would most likely include an agreement to keep featuring Nook devices in Barnes & Noble bookstores, analysts said.
Barnes & Noble said that a special committee of its board, led by Patricia L. Higgins, would evaluate any proposal. Those directors have retained Evercore Partners and the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison as advisers. Mr. Riggio is working with the Peter J. Solomon Company.
An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the role of its largest shareholder, Leonard Riggio, in the company's history. While Mr. Riggio founded the modern company that acquired the name in the 1970s, William Barnes and G. Clifford Noble opened the original Barnes & Noble bookstore, in 1917.

 The Week's Bests 
 Mark Suster explains why the "Harlem shake" is the beginning of an important new video trend: "Participation. We are the media. We want to be in it. Create it. Take part in it. Have a say, a vote. Think 'American Idol' voting, where the audience gets to feel like they're participating. And where they're willing to pay by dialing a paid number to feel like they're, well, participating."
 Chris Heivly, writing about nondisclosure agreements, explains why he won't sign your N.D.A.: "I am in the business of backing great teams working on great ideas. Inherent in this new relationship is trust. I am not going to steal your idea. I don't have time to build a company - I invest in companies. I am not in the business of pitching your idea to others to build. And most important, if I did this just once, I would be labeled, and my deal flow would disappear."
 Christopher Mims explains how robots are eating the last of America's - and the world's - traditional manufacturing jobs: "Not everyone is suffering. Skilled workers, for example, are earning more than ever. So are the very rich, those who own the capital that can be put to work in the world's increasingly person-free farms, mines and factories. But those who used to make middle-class wages are increasingly slipping into lower-paying, service-sector jobs. That's led to what M.I.T. economist David Autor calls an 'hourglass economy,' with more workers at both the top and (mostly) the bottom of the income spectrum."

HEADLINE: 'There Is No Sustainable Business.'

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE


HIGHLIGHT: Douglas Tompkins, the founder of Esprit and The North Face and now an ardent conservationist, has some radical notions &#8212; and millions of acres in South America. 

 BODY:
BARCELONA - Sustainable entrepreneurship - a buzzword in an increasingly eco-conscious business world - is often described as a balance between profit and environmental impact.
It's a subject that Douglas Tompkins seems to have thought a lot about. He founded Esprit and The North Face, two of America's most iconic clothing and fashion brands, only to quit the business world to become a staunch conservationalist, environmentalist and critic.
"Remove 'sustainable' from your dictionary, there is no sustainable business. Only biological sustainability counts," he told a room full of business students at the IESE business school Doing Great and Doing Good conference on responsible business. (Disclosure: I moderated a panel at the same conference). 
"Economic activity has impact and we are just now doing a better job of measuring what those impacts are," said Mr. Tompkins in an interview.
A strict conservationalist, he rejects the idea that big business can reform itself and thinks the answer lies outside what he calls the "techno-industrial culture." He thinks measuring biodiversity is a yardstick for how society is doing.
"Healthy biodiversity is at the base of everything," he said, with species extinction being the ultimate catastrophe. "We'll be living on a sand heap with a Norwegian rat and a few cockroaches at the end."
Despite having co-founded ESPRIT, the multinational clothing giant, and The North Face, the maker of outdoor equipment, in the 1960s and having earned millions of the sale of the former, Mr. Tompkins is critical of business's paradigms.
"We have an economy that's based on growth without limits," he said. "How is that possible?"
"To grow and grow and grow without limits is out of the question," he said.
Even the companies that he is famous for launching do not escape his disapproval.
"My two companies are two monsters now," he said.
His conversion from fashion to conservation work took place around 1990, however Mr. Tompkins still retains his sense of simple beauty.
"If we just use the aesthetic rule of thumb of saying if it looks bad, it is bad and if it looks good, it - probably - is good," we'd get a lot further than with arcane and complex economic theories."
But Mr. Tompkins is much more than an anti-business theorist or a conservation advocate. In the last two decades he and his wife have managed to conserve land that will ultimately enlarge or create national parks in Chile and Argentina.
Mr. Tompkins started his drive toward conservation and reclaiming natural habitat in 1990, right around the time he had sold his share of Esprit for a reported $150 million. (He sold his interest in The North Face much earlier in his career and at a much lower price.)
To date, he and his wife have bought up 1.1 million hectares (or almost 2.5 million acres) in South America, through several of his conservation foundations. The land conserved or in the process of being restored, is open to public use, with conditions, until it is donated to the countries' national park systems. (My colleague Larry Rohter visited Mr. Tompkins in 2007 and wrote about the political implications of an American buying up so much land in Chile.)
Besides their work restoring land for parks, the Tompkins are developing sustainable farms (he doesn't like to call it sustainable, just less unsustainable) in both Chile and Argentina.
At Laguna Blanca in northeastern Argentina, the Tompkins have bought and reconstituted land for a sustainable farm project. 
Organic crops are planted using small-scale methods not in square plots, as is common in commercial farming, but following the contours of nature. Passages for wildlife are integrated into the fields.
The farm products are then sold to the surrounding community, with profit going toward his conservation efforts.

HEADLINE: Religious Groups Urge Deficit Reduction and Protection of the Poor

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Leaders from some of the nation&#8217;s largest Christian congregations are urging President Obama and members of Congress to end their fiscal brinkmanship and find a balanced approach to reducing the deficit that will also protect the poorest Americans. 

 BODY:
Leaders from some of the nation's largest and most influential Christian congregations are urging President Obama and members of Congress to end their fiscal brinkmanship and find a way to agree on new revenue and spending cuts that will reduce the deficit while protecting the poorest Americans.
In a public letter, to be released on Monday just days before severe budget cuts are scheduled to go into effect, the groups urge that the fiscal debate be framed in terms of "moral choices." The letter blames both parties for slowing the country's economic recovery and risking the possibility that more people will slide into poverty. 
"Moving from one crisis to another has slowed economic recovery and has kept Congress from finding a sound, moral path to fiscal sustainability," the letter says. "Other important issues go unaddressed, all the while increasing cynicism about our political process." 
Almost 100 pastoral leaders signed the letter, including the president of the National Association of Evangelicals, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the president of the National Baptist Convention. 
The group calls itself the "Circle of Protection" and has organized to weigh in on political issues. The mission statement on the group's Web site says it is committed to resisting "budget cuts that undermine the lives, dignity and rights of poor and vulnerable people."
In the letter, the religious leaders use similar language to that of Mr. Obama in calling for what they call a "balanced and thoughtful" approach to cutting the deficit that protects people who rely on government services.
"Important choices must be made: we must weigh the benefits of tax credits for low-income people and tax breaks for high-income people; of nutrition assistance to low-income families and subsidies to agricultural businesses," the letter says.
It adds: "Congress can and must develop a balanced and thoughtful path forward that protects the most vulnerable and preserves economic opportunity."
Jim Wallis, the chief executive of Sojourners, a social justice organization, said the battle over the automatic cuts, called "sequestration," is "a good but tragic example of how the idea of the common good is failing in American politics."
Mr. Wallis, who helped to organize the letter from the religious leaders, said he hoped it would convince the president and the lawmakers to consider how to meet their fiscal obligations without hurting the people who need government the most.
"The unity of the faith community is clear here," he said. "It is time to move responsibly toward fiscal responsibility and protect the poor at the same time. That is our commitment and our principle; and both political sides should embrace it."
In a news release set to accompany the letter, several other religious leaders urged the political parties to pay attention.
Kathryn M. Lohre, the president of the National Council of Churches, called it a "scandalous reality" that one in five children are living in poverty in America. In a statement in the news release, Ms. Lohre said that officials should find a way to protect the poor while enhancing the nation's economic situation.
"We urge our elected leaders to continue to seek financial health for this nation while protecting those who are living at its margins, those whom Jesus called 'the least of these,' " she said. "The fiscal showdowns of recent months fail to honor the fact that 46.2 million of us are already living on the brink. This is not acceptable to us, nor is it acceptable to God."

HEADLINE: Japan Plans to Sell $10 Billion Stake in Cigarette Firm

BYLINE: HIROKO TABUCHI


HIGHLIGHT: The Japanese government is set to loosen its grip on Japan Tobacco, the world&#8217;s third-largest tobacco company, by selling a third of its stake. 

 BODY:
TOKYO - The Japanese government is set to loosen its grip on Japan Tobacco, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, by selling a third of its stake in a sale that will net the country about $10 billion.
Under laws passed in 2011 after a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, proceeds of the sale of Japan Tobacco shares will go toward rebuilding the country's battered northeast coast. The reconstruction costs have threatened to weigh on Japan's public finances at a time when public debt is twice the size of its economy. 
The nation's Finance Ministry, which owns just over 50 percent of the former state monopoly, will sell 333 million of its shares in the cigarette manufacturer, according to a company statement issued on Monday.
The deal will be priced next month, from March 11 to 13, the statement said. Before the sale, Japan Tobacco will buy back up to 250 billion yen ($2.7 billion) of its shares.
Japan's stock market has rallied since mid-November, and Japan Tobacco's shares have tracked the market's ascent, climbing 20 percent in the last three months, making the move an opportune time for the Japanese government to sell.
Shares in Japan Tobacco closed 1.43 percent higher on Monday, at 2,901 yen ($31), before the planned sale was announced. At that price, the government's share sale would be valued at roughly 967 billion yen.
Japan has already been reducing its stake and involvement in the cigarette maker, which traces its origins to a Finance Ministry bureau set up in 1898 to create a national tobacco monopoly that lasted until 1985.
Even after the company went public, the Finance Ministry held two-thirds of its shares until 2004, when it reduced its stake to 50.1 percent, or roughly one billion shares. Other investors in Japan Tobacco include Mizuho Trust & Banking, Goldman Sachs and the Children's Investment Fund Management.
The nation's investment in Japan Tobacco has put the government in a controversial position.
The government has squeezed more funds from its smokers, raising the price of a pack of cigarettes about 40 percent in 2010, its single largest increase in tobacco taxes. Still, cigarettes remain relatively cheap in Japan, at about $4.30 a pack.
But antismoking advocates have blamed the Japanese government's continued ownership of Japan Tobacco - whose brands include Camel, Winston and Mild Seven - for the country's delay in passing laws to protect nonsmokers from cigarette smoke, for example, and more stringently regulating of tobacco-related marketing.
In a 2012 report, the Washington-based Global Business Group on Health said Japan's ownership of Japan Tobacco shares "leads to a national conflict of interest, in which the government treats smoking as a behavioral issue rather than a health concern."
Though smoking rates have started to decline in recent years, the Japanese remain heavy smokers, consuming about 1,841 cigarettes a person, according to data compiled last year by the World Lung Foundation and American Cancer Society. That compared with about 1,000 cigarettes a person in the United States.
To make up for declining cigarette consumption at home, Japan Tobacco has aggressively expanded overseas, acquiring Britain's Gallaher Group in 2007 for $15 billion, and adding the Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges brands to its portfolio. The company has also made a push into packaged foods and soft drinks, as well as pharmaceuticals.
The government's sale of Japan Tobacco shares is part of a wider effort to raise money to finance reconstruction from the country's natural and nuclear disasters in 2011. The government also plans to sell shares of Japan Post Holdings, which runs the country's postal system and also acts as its biggest bank.

HEADLINE: The Ant, the Grasshopper and Electricity Prices in New England

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: New England&#8217;s electricity shortage is rooted in disincentives for gas-fired generators to invest in pipeline capacity, experts say. 

 BODY:
The electricity crunch in New England that I wrote about on Feb. 15 persists, and it is clearly related to a shortage of natural gas pipeline capacity relative to growing demand. But experts say the root cause is something more complicated: a structural flaw in the regional electric market. 
The gas industry, the electricity generators and the , which runs the grid, all say there is a problem, although they are not quite in agreement on how to solve it. The details are important because the phenomenon could spread around the country. 
The problem in New England, which has resulted in electricity for sustained periods, is that all of the pipeline transmission capacity has been purchased by the local gas distribution companies that sell gas for home heating and retail uses. When those companies need all that capacity to meet customer demand during a cold snap, there is nothing left over for them to sell to the gas-fired electricity generators.
The two sets of companies are a bit like the in Aesop's fable. The hard-working ant, or local distribution company, survives the winter, but the grasshopper, or merchant generator, does not. 
In theory, those merchant generators, which are independently owned and compete in selling to the electric companies that sell power at the retail level, could solve the problem by buying capacity themselves. But in practice, the electric market discourages them from doing so, experts say.
The reason is that the merchant generators operate in a competitive market and cannot afford the burden of buying constant transmission capacity; it is a bit like buying a train ticket for a trip every day of the year even though you don't make the journey every day. A merchant generator who bought such capacity would be very competitive for the few weeks a year when capacity is tight, but not for the rest of the year.
By contrast, the gas distribution companies are monopolies regulated by public service commissions and can simply fold their pipeline charges into electricity rates. 
"The fundamental problem when you look at the New England market is economics,'' saidDonald F. Santa Jr., president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, the trade association of the pipeline owners. 
"The way the electric market is now structured, there is little premium placed on reliability and on compensating generators for that,'' he said. "There's no real incentive for them to hold firm capacity, and if they do, you can argue it puts them at a competitive disadvantage relative to their peers.''
And that is because of another quirk in the market. Other kinds of investment in transportation are made because the investor senses there will be a market and wants to capture the business and make a profit, but gas pipelines are built only when contracts are in hand from shippers. 
"We don't build on spec," as a spokeswoman for the pipeline group, Cathy Landry, put it. 
The pipeline owners agree that demand for gas has grown far faster than their ability to transport it, and that they should either lay new pipe or add compressor stations to squeeze more gas through existing pipe. The trend in New England is not very different from the trend in the Midwest. New York is in a slightly different situation; local rules require that gas generators be able to run on fuel oil as well in a pinch. 
New England generators used to avoid this problem by stocking up on diesel oil, but environmental rules discourage this. (The "gas" in "gas-fired generator" does not refer to natural gas, but to the physical form of the gas being burned; fuel oil, although stored as a liquid, can be turned into a gas.) And at the moment, if New England generators spend the extra money to build and fill a tank, they are not compensated for that. 
The group that represents the local gas companies, the American Gas Association, agrees that a structural problem exists. "Our nation has access to abundant supplies of natural gas and a robust network of 2.4 million miles of natural gas pipelines that reliably deliver this fuel," Dave McCurdy, its president and chief executive, said in a statement. "Until power generation markets appropriately incentivize continued infrastructure investments, New England will struggle to meet the growing energy needs in the region."
In other words, the market should pay more for electricity from a generator that has invested in making its power supply reliable than for the same product from a generator that can only produce when the weather is warm and gas demand is low.
Even the power generators agree. Yet Dan Dolan, a spokesman for the New England Power Generators Association, said the devil is in the details: how should the market be structured to compensate the grasshopper for becoming an ant?
The Independent System Operator is thinking of both incentives and disincentives. New England, like New York State and the market to the south,PJM, (which used to stand for Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland), has a market for electric energy but also for capacity. 
Companies that buy electricity, like utilities that distribute it to homes and businesses, also pay for generating capacity equal to their expected demand. So independent generators collect a fee for simply having capacity available as well as a fee for the energy they produce. 
At the New England Independent System Operator, Vamsi Chadalavada, the chief operating officer, said companies that collect the capacity fee must be able to get fuel and produce electricity when called upon. "If we call upon them and they do not deliver, there has to be a significant consequence," he said. Companies that cannot produce would pay penalties, he said, and that money would go to companies that do. 
"If I stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars any given day, I'm going to do everything within my capability to make sure that doesn't happen," Mr. Chadalavada said. Generators would therefore buy firm gas transmission capacity or make other kinds of investments to ensure reliability. 
An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of the spokeswoman for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. She is Cathy Landry, not Kathy.

HEADLINE: What if the Republicans Had Won the Senate?

BYLINE: CARL HULSE


HIGHLIGHT: What would the political landscape in Washington look like if Republicans had won the Senate last November? 

 BODY:
Alternative history is a popular niche in fiction. What would the world look like if Pickett had carried the day at Gettysburg? What if the Japanese had prevailed at Midway? How different would current events be if President Kennedy's assassination had been thwarted?
A similar exercise is being conducted in Washington these days as President Obama and Congressional Republicans engage in a series of grinding showdowns over fiscal policy, nominations, gun laws and immigration changes, with more to come. In light of the implications of the partisan divide, it seems a fair question to ask: What would the political landscape in Washington look like if the Republicans had won the Senate last November? 
Given how the election played out, it isn't a stretch to imagine an Obama presidency and a Republican Senate, along with continued Republican control of the House. With Mr. Obama's re-election, Republicans needed to gain four seats to win the majority. Democrats won five seats in states won by Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, four of them in races where Republicans started out with big advantages: Indiana, Missouri, Montana and North Dakota.
Victories there would have made Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader while making Mr. Obama miserable, since a Republican Senate held the potential to significantly reshape the contours of the president's second term. 
It is clear that if Richard Mourdock, Todd Akin, Denny Rehberg and Rick Berg were now casting votes in the Senate, the national political dynamic would be sharply different. In the building fight over the across-the-board spending cuts set to take effect Friday, the Republican-controlled Congress would probably be dictating terms to Mr. Obama, sending him legislation that would redistribute the cuts away from the Pentagon to social programs that Democrats would be unable to protect.
Former Senator Chuck Hagel would not be about to clear a filibuster to become secretary of defense, but would instead be bottled up in committee, perhaps along with John O. Brennan, awaiting a vote on his nomination to head the Central Intelligence Agency, and Jack Lew, the nominee for Treasury secretary. John Kerry would still be at the State Department, but his confirmation might have been bumpier.
Even the lame-duck session would have been different. It seems implausible that Mr. Obama would have been able to stare down soon-to-be-majority Congressional Republicans over the Bush tax cuts. Instead, Republicans could have held out for all the cuts to remain in place and then tried to force the issue when the 113th Congress convened with them in control.
The Newtown shootings would still have spurred discussion in Congress about tighter gun laws, but it is highly doubtful that debate about new background checks and limits on magazine size would be as serious as it is. As for immigration policy, the lack of Hispanic support that helped doom Mr. Romney's presidential bid would have provided strong reason for Republicans to explore changes in immigration law. But would a path to citizenship be on the table, given conservative resistance?
And instead of using nominations to try to pry information out of the White House, Senate Republicans would have been empowered to conduct oversight hearings of the kind that can tie a second-term administration in knots.
Then there is the one aspect of a Republican Senate that might most frighten Democrats.
"Ted Cruz would be in the majority," Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat re-elected in November, said about the confrontational Republican newcomer from Texas, who is already making his presence felt in the minority.
Republicans acknowledge that they have occasionally given wistful thought to what might have been.
"Maybe after a few beers," said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. He, like other Republicans, believes that Congress and the country would be much better off if Republicans had taken over as a counterweight to the president, creating a unified Congress able to reach some agreement on thorny policy issues.
"If those five seats had gone the other way, we'd have a budget right now, the appropriations process would be working, it would just be very different," Mr. Portman said. "It happened over two election cycles, so they kind of add up, but if we can even get a slim majority we can get a budget."
Ms. Klobuchar said she thought the divided Congress offered more potential for true compromise than a Republican House and Senate constantly confronting a Democratic president. With the Senate in Democratic hands and the House under Republicans, lawmakers will have to reach consensus agreements on the tough issues of guns, immigration and spending if they want to see them enacted.
"I think this is just a better situation," she said. "Instead of Congress versus the president, you at least have something in the middle, which is the Senate."
Moving forward, Republicans will no doubt continue to rue the losses that kept them in the Senate minority. For instance, a Supreme Court seat could open up, and Republicans won't have the same leverage they might have had to push Mr. Obama toward a pick that could clear a Republican-led Senate.
But that might just be more incentive for Republicans to try to seize that majority in the elections next year.
"You have to live with the reality of it," said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming. "You just work that much harder for 2014."

HEADLINE: Notes on the Decline of Work

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Should we worry about the decline of workforce participation? 

 BODY:
My Sunday column on America's declining rates of workforce participation raised a provocative issue without addressing all the possible objections to my claim that this is something we should be concerned about. With that in mind, here are provisional responses to three questions that a careful reader might have about my argument. 
 Isn't declining workforce participation just an inevitable consequence of America's steady aging? 
To some extent, yes. The Baby Boomers' retirement always guaranteed that we would have a lower employment-to-population ratio in 2030 than in 1990. But demographic change alone doesn't explain the trend we're seeing: The workforce participation rate has been falling since the 1990s among prime working-age Americans, not just among the retired and near-retired, and for the population as a whole, there's been a faster dropoff in employment than most analysts expected. (As you can see from the second chart in this post by the Atlantic's Derek Thompson, this was true even before the Great Recession, though the projections and the reality have diverged more sharply since 2008.) What's more, since the financial crash workforce participation actually actually been going up among Americans 55 and older, as more people postpone retirement or take part-time work to cushion the loss of savings. For today, at least, the trend away from employment is happening entirely among the under-55s.
 Isn't this just a male phenomenon - and isn't it offset by women entering the workforce? 
Twenty years ago, the answer was yes: Male labor force participation was dropping from its mid-century high, but female employment rates had risen steadily, and the overall effect was a larger workforce overall. But since the 1990s, as this Brookings paper explains, women's labor force participation rates have leveled off and started dropping as well. And the female trend is now similar to the male trend (though not as sharp and swift), with younger, less-educated, unmarried women exiting the workforce in the largest numbers than their married, better-educated peers. In other words, it isn't just an "opt-out" situation, with today's wives leaving the workplace to raise children in larger numbers than their mothers did: That phenomenon may exist, but it isn't the big driver of workforce decline.
 Okay, but since we did have those decades of female employment growth, we have more people in the workforce overall than we did fifty years ago - and that's likely to remain the case for some time. So what's the big worry? 
Well, the aging of America means that if working-age labor force participation keeps falling, we'll be back to the levels of the 1950s much faster than anyone expected - and that workforce will be paying for a much more expensive entitlement system than the workforce of the Eisenhower era did. But as I said in the column, the economic costs of this trend may actually be manageable; it's the social costs that are more worrisome. The non-employed working age Americans of the 1950s were mostly married women with wage-earning partners and children at home, with meant that they were members of income-producing economic units and embedded in strong social networks even if they weren't holding down a 9-5 job. If today's shrinking employment-to-population ratio were mostly a post-feminist variation on that theme, driven by a combination of married men staying home with the kids while their wives work and professional women taking time off during their prime childbearing years, then it would be less troubling that what we're seeing today. But instead today's decline in work is concentrated among the unmarried and less-educated - populations, that is, that tend to lack precisely the sources of social capital and economic advancement that participation in an even a low-paying job can help supply.
So while a decline in workforce participation is not inherently problematic, the fact that it's happening among people who lack other sources of community and other means of socioeconomic ascent means that it's more likely to compound existing trends toward stratification and atomization, hardening the lines of class and making individual lives unhappier even if the economic pie continues to grow. Hence my suggestion that this trend is of a piece with the declines in marriage and churchgoing and other forms of social "joining" - trends which aren't likely to impoverish us, but whose consequences for opportunity and community and self-sufficiency threaten other, equally crucial, elements of the American Dream.

HEADLINE: With Rent Ever Higher, Irish Pub Gives Up

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: The Emerald Inn, which survived as its Upper West Side neighborhood reinvented itself with pricier and pricier stores, is to close April 30 after 70 years. 

 BODY:
In a neighborhood where shiny outposts of big-name retailers have displaced the little stores and restaurants where everybody seemed to know everybody else, a longtime holdout is finally planning a last last call.
The Emerald Inn, which survived on Columbus Avenue as the Upper West Side reinvented itself as a pricier and pricier neighborhood, will close on April 30, the owners said.
"It's rent," said Charlie Campbell, whose grandfather opened the Emerald Inn during World War II. "It's really sad." 
The monthly payment would have come to $35,000 if the lease had been renewed, he said. He has been paying $17,500 a month under a deal worked out in 2011. 
Mike Clarke, an owner of the A.J. Clarke Real Estate Corporation, which manages the apartment building that houses the Emerald Inn, would not discuss the exact amount the landlord had sought for a lease renewal. But he did not dispute Mr. Campbell's figures.
Mr. Clarke said the storefront the Emerald Inn has occupied since Franklin D. Roosevelt was president and Fiorello H. La Guardia was mayor would become a Kate Spade clothing store. It will be the chain's third shop in Manhattan.
The Emerald, as its regulars call it, has come close to closing before. In 2009, there was talk of a final goodbye, but because the recession was deepening and new tenants were suddenly in short supply, Mr. Campbell managed to negotiate a rent increase he could handle.
A couple of other old-time Irish bars in the neighborhood have struggled against the same daunting economics. 
Malachy's Donegal Inn, at 103 West 72nd Street, faced a March 1 closing date but won a reprieve and will remain open at least through the end of the year. Another Irish pub in the same block of West 72nd Street, P.D. O'Hurley's, closed last month. A sign on the window said it was moving to 250 West 72nd Street, between Broadway and West End Avenue. But that storefront was dark on Monday. Its Web site, which was live just last week, appeared to have been disconnected. 
"It's to the point where anybody who's still left is paying an exorbitant amount of money," Mr. Campbell said.
The Emerald's regulars have their memories: 
Of the Christmas Eve scene in the movie "The Apartment" that was filmed there. (One thing led to another after Hope Holiday pelted Jack Lemmon with straw-paper wrappers.)
Of the time Hugh Downs's secretary walked in with a copy of Bartender magazine. (Mike Campbell, Charlie Campbell's father, said he had thrown out his copy without bothering to read it. The secretary pointed to an article quoting Mr. Downs on his favorite bars. "He had picked someplace in Africa," Mike Campbell said, "and the Emerald Inn.")
Of the time the bass-baritone Bryn Terfel sang "Danny Boy." Of star turns by the likes of Regis Philbin, Liam Neeson and Howard Stern. Of stars who sat at the bar, reading a book, and were left alone. (James Gandolfini, when "The Sopranos" was still new.)
Of network-news expense accounts that once seemed limitless. "They can't afford to go out in this area anymore," Mr. Campbell said. "They can't afford to spend $8 for a drink, $9 for a drink."
Of "The Pint Man," a 2010 novel that involves a love story and a lot of scenes in a bar that seemed to be the Emerald in everything but name.
"I'm devastated," said Steve Rushin, the sportswriter who wrote "The Pint Man." And no wonder. The Emerald was where he had his first date with Rebecca Lobo, then a women's basketball star.
"We met at the Dublin House" - another Irish bar on the Upper West Side - "but I thought I'd class it up by taking her to the Emerald Inn," he said. "It was like a home away from home, an extension of people's apartments. If you have a one-room apartment, this was like the front room. I remember sitting in that second booth on the right, waiting for the woman who is now my wife to walk through that swinging door."
Michael Morfit, an investment banker and youth lacrosse coach, said the Emerald's closing would be another sad moment for the neighborhood. "We've lost a lot of the traditional places around here," he said, standing at the bar on a recent afternoon. "I see people who'd come here and they say, 'Where are we going to go now?'"
Charlie Campbell said he was looking for a new storefront on a side street. His 24-year-old son, Charles III, who was tending the bar on a recent afternoon, said he had taken the licensing test to be a plumber.
"As a backup," Charles III said, in case the search for a new place drags on.
For his part, Mr. Clarke, the managing agent, said he was sorry to see the Campbells leave.
"They're very nice people," he said. "We've had a wonderful relationship." But he said the two sides were too far apart on money this time around.

HEADLINE: The Sequester, State by State

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: Across-the-board budget cuts will hurt all 50 states, but not equally. 

 BODY:
The hatchet job on the federal budget commonly known as the sequester will hurt all 50 states both directly and indirectly, but it won't hurt them equally.
The Pew Center on the States has assembled a pain gauge, ranking the states according to various "indicators of vulnerabilities to the cuts." One indicator is federal grants subject to the sequester as a percentage of state revenue. By that metric, South Dakota will fare the worst, at 10.3 percent versus a national average of 6.6 percent. Then Illinois, Georgia, Texas and Tennessee. (For those who keep track of this sort of thing, that's four red states and one blue state in the top five.)

By other metrics, it's the D.C. region that will suffer the most. Federal spending on procurement, salaries and wages as a percentage of state GDP is 19.7 percent in Maryland, Virginia and D.C., versus a national average of 5.3 percent. (Pew combined the data due to the large number of commuters in the area.) So when across-the-board cuts go into effect, those three states will be far more exposed than, say, Delaware, where such spending amounts to only 1.3 percent of GDP. 
States that seem relatively lucky under some measurements get hosed under others. West Virginia, for example, falls into the bottom third of vulnerability for federal defense spending as a percentage of state GDP, and in the top third for nondefense spending.
If the sequester won't damage the states evenly or equally, it certainly won't redound to any state's benefit.
Desperate to save the government from default during the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011, the White House proposed automatic across-the-board cuts, which would go into effect if legislators failed to pass a rational deficit reduction plan. Jack Lew, the nominee to replace Tim Geithner as Treasury Secretary and the budget director during the negotiations, has described the sequester as "a consequence that would be so unacceptable to everyone that we would be able to get action." That is to say, the sequester is ugly by design, though apparently not ugly enough to "get action" from Republicans, who won't agree to the revenue increases that would stop it.

HEADLINE: Memo to Europe: What About T-Bills?

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A transaction tax could work well for stocks, but not so well for Treasury bills 

 BODY:
In my column on Friday, I looked at the proposed European transaction tax from a stock market perspective, and found it to be reasonable.
A friend who is a tax lawyer says - rightly - that I should have considered bonds, particularly short-term Treasury securities. He has a point. 
The proposed tax would be applied to all trades in stocks, bonds and derivatives that were engaged in by European financial institutions, or in European markets. That encompasses about everything. For stocks and bonds that tax would be one-tenth of 1 percent of the value of the bond. There would be no tax when the bond is sold at issuance, but there would be a tax whenever it changes hands after that.
The trouble is that Treasury bills these days yield almost nothing. The current rate on one-month bills is a little under 0.1 percent. A tax of 0.1 percent would wipe out the yield entirely. 
Treasury bills are prized for their liquidity, meaning that if you need cash you can sell one at any moment. Who would buy it in the secondary market with this tax? When I asked one European official about that, he pointed out that there would be no tax on borrowings, so you could repo the T-bill without paying the tax.
The tax would not apply if American institutions traded the bills, but would if banks from the European countries planning to levy the tax chose to do so. That list includes France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
The tax would apply to any bank anywhere trading German government securities. Their yields are - believe it or not - a tad bit lower than American yields. 
It seems to me that there will need to be some exceptions made.

HEADLINE: Banks Fear Court Ruling in Argentina Bond Debt

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: An appeals court ruling on a case between the government of Argentina and hedge funds and other investors could have a major effect on world debt markets. 

 BODY:
A fierce battle between the government of Argentina and investors led by a group of hedge funds has already led to the seizure of a naval ship and dragged in the United States Treasury. Now a federal appeals court is hearing the dispute, and how it rules could have a major impact on world debt markets.
The investors - including the hedge fund tycoon Paul E. Singer - sued Argentina seeking payment for $1.3 billion relating to bonds that the country defaulted on in 2001. On Wednesday, the case comes before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which has already sided with the hedge funds on their main arguments.
But the issue that the appeals court is still undecided about is perhaps the most important. It involves devising a method to pressure Argentina to pay up on the disputed bonds. And that has left the investors who hold a majority of Argentina's foreign debt vulnerable, as well as the banks that process the payments to those investors. 
 While the hedge funds have grabbed the headlines - winning a temporary court order to seize an Argentine naval ship docked in Ghana, for example - most of the other holders of Argentina's nearly $100 billion in defaulted debt agreed over the last decade to accept new bonds, taking big losses in the process. The country has since faithfully paid on the exchange bonds.
At the same time, Argentina has vehemently repeated that it will not pay the hedge funds and other holders of its old debt and has passed laws forbidding the government from paying anything to the bondholders who didn't participate in the exchanges.
But last year, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that if Argentina wanted to pay the holders of the restructured debt, it would have to pay the hedge funds and other holders of the defaulted debt, too. The judge included third-party banks in his injunction, and prohibited them from processing payments to holders of the exchange bonds unless all debt holders were paid.
Large banks, investors and the United States Treasury Department have objected to the judge's order. In short, they say, using the sanction could cause financial losses for innocent bystanders and lead to unnecessary disruption in the bond markets.
"They are trying to block the payments system," said Vladimir Werning, executive director for Latin American research at JPMorgan Chase. "This is unprecedented in the New York jurisdiction."
In an e-mail, Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, which handles bond payments, said the ruling, "will create unrest in the credit markets and result in cascades of litigation, which is precisely the opposite effect that an injunction should have."
A ruling in favor of the hedge funds would also have ripple effects throughout the debt markets.
"Any time you have something that can change of balance of power, it can matter beyond Argentina," said Robert Kahn, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Despite the legal worries, investors have so far been keen to hold higher-yielding emerging markets debt, given that interest rates are so low. Apart from Argentine bonds, debt issued by developing countries has performed strongly.
Unlike Argentina, some countries have held their noses and cut deals with holdouts in the past to get on with important economic overhauls, most recently Greece on certain smaller foreign-law bonds.
And in the years since Argentina's default, most sovereign bonds have special clauses in them that make it much harder for holdouts to succeed. These are called collective action clauses, which state that if a certain majority of bondholders agree to take losses in a bond restructuring, those losses would be forced on all bondholders, even would-be holdouts who don't agree.
But large amounts of bonds, those issued more than 10 years ago, do not have collective action clauses. And those that do have the clauses may not act as intended if the holdouts win their Argentina case, said Mr. Werning of JPMorgan.
Right now, a bond with a collective action clause might get restructured if 75 percent of the holders agree to it. If Judge Griesa's ruling is upheld, more bondholders might be reluctant to enter a restructuring and the required majority might not be achieved. Bondholders might not enter the restructuring because they fear holdout litigation depriving them of payments later on.
"This could adversely affect the level of participation in a swap," Mr. Werning said.
Still, others contend that the market for sovereign debt may be improved if the judge's ruling is upheld, with the sanction on payments banks mostly intact. Countries like Argentina, they say, have taken advantage of the fact that there is no bankruptcy regime in the sovereign debt market to allow creditors to recoup money in a default. Indeed, Judge Griesa has said the Argentina case is partly about creating safeguards for creditors in the absence of bankruptcy regime.
But Anna Gelpern, a professor at the Washington College of Law at the American University, said that if the federal court's rulings are upheld, it might just end up underscoring the limitations of the American courts' power.
"What if Argentina still doesn't settle? How does the court look then?" she said. "It can only isolate Argentina and Argentina seems content to be isolated."
While there is a chance that the appellate court's decision could be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, it is more likely that its ruling will be the final word on the lower court order.
According to that order, if a bank chose to channel payments from Argentina to the owners of the restructured debt, the bank would not be in compliance with his order. A payments bank, Bank of New York Mellon in the case of Argentine exchange bonds, would then decline to process the exchange bond payments, and the bonds could fall into default, inflicting big losses on their holders.
Some market specialists have raised the prospect that Argentina could keep paying the exchange bondholders by avoiding payments banks that operate in the United States. It could, for instance, swap the exchange bonds for new instruments registered under Argentine law that make payments through an Argentine entity.
But the court may decide that, in such a situation, the exchange bondholders themselves would be breaking its injunction. One of the things the appeals court is looking into is how to determine which third parties should sit outside the reach of the district court's ruling.
It is not just hedge funds who are hoping to gain from an affirmation of the lower court ruling. This group also includes many individual investors, who are now feeling more optimistic about getting their money back as the case comes before the appeals court.
"We are hopeful the ruling will stay as issued," said Horacio Vázquez, who helps lead a group in Buenos Aires that represents bondholders.

HEADLINE: 'Shareholder Democracy' Can Mask Abuses

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: It increasingly appears that the rise of &#8220;shareholder democracy&#8221; is leading, in some cases, to a perverse game. 

 BODY:
Martin Lipton, one of the nation's top corporate lawyers, was dismayed.
Having watched David Einhorn, the activist investor, go to battle with Apple in the last two weeks to push it to distribute some of its $137 billion cash hoard to shareholders, Mr. Lipton had seen enough. Mr. Einhorn, he thought, had gone too far.
A longtime counselor to the Fortune 500 as one of the founding partners of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, he sat down and wrote a scathing memo to his clients on his view that "shareholder democracy" has run amok.
 "The activist-hedge-fund attack on Apple - in which one of the most successful, long-term-visionary companies of all time is being told by a money manager that Apple is doing things all wrong and should focus on short-term return of cash - is a clarion call for effective action to deal with the misuse of shareholder power," he wrote. The memo was entitled, "Bite the Apple; Poison the Apple; Paralyze the Company; Wreck the Economy." 
Mr. Lipton said that long-term shareholders in public companies are being undermined "by a gaggle of activist hedge funds who troll through S.E.C. filings looking for opportunities to demand a change in a company's strategy or portfolio that will create a short-term profit without regard to the impact on the company's long-term prospects."
While "shareholder democracy" may be a good sound bite, Mr. Lipton has a point worth considering.
It increasingly appears that the rise of "shareholder democracy" is leading, in some cases, to a perverse game in which so-called activist investors take to the media to pump or dump stocks in hopes of creating a fleeting rise or fall in a company's stock price. The battle over Apple is just one minor example. Carl Icahn's investment in Herbalife, betting against William Ackman's accusation that the company is a "pyramid scheme," is another.
That's not to say that shareholder democracy is a bad thing. Shareholders have successfully and properly brought pressure to bear on underperforming companies, pushed out entrenched directors and, in some cases, pressed for operational changes to address health and the environment.
At a time when investors are calling for managements and directors to think more about the long term, this latest breed of activism is also multiplying. But are these activists interested in the long term?
According to Leo E. Strine Jr., the chief judge of the Delaware Court of Chancery, the answer is usually obvious: no.
"Many activist investors hold their stock for a very short period of time and may have the potential to reap profits based on short-term trading strategies that arbitrage corporate policies," he wrote in a widely circulated essay for the American Bar Association. Near the beginning of his essay he asked: "Why should we expect corporations to chart a sound long-term course of economic growth, if the so-called investors who determine the fate of their managers do not themselves act or think with the long term in mind?"
The academic literature provides a mixed and inconclusive assessment of the true effect of activism on shareholder value over the long-term.
In fairness, it must be said that not all activist investors are created equal and not all of their investments should be considered in the same way. Nelson Peltz, once called a corporate raider, fought his way onto the board of Heinz in 2006. He is still on the board and approved the sale of the company to Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital just weeks ago.
Daniel Loeb, the founder of Third Point Management, similarly fought his way onto the board of Yahoo after exposing its former chief executive, Scott Thomson, for lying on his résumé. He is now a board member and helped recruit Marissa Mayer to be chief executive. Whether he likes it or not, Mr. Loeb is a long-term shareholder in Yahoo. Just weeks ago, however, he announced that he had made an investment in Herbalife that his peer, Mr. Ackman, is betting against. Part of Mr. Loeb's bet was simply a short-term gamble; he has since sold some of his investment, taking profits off the table.
Similarly, Mr. Ackman has made some long-term bets - he held his short position in MBIA for years and is now a long-term investor and director of J. C. Penney - but he has also made a series of short-term investments as well.
As for Mr. Einhorn's fight with Apple, it is hard to argue he is a short-term investor in the company; his firm, Greenlight Capital, has held a stake for the past three years. But the measures he is pressing the company to pursue - creating a "iPref" or preferred share that pays a dividend to shareholders in perpetuity - feel a lot like financial engineering to create some quick value for investors.
In a news release announcing his proposal, which would have Apple create $50 billion in perpetual preferred stock, Mr. Einhorn said that amount of the new shares "would unlock about $30 billion, or $32 per share in value. Greenlight believes that Apple has the capacity to ultimately distribute several hundred billion dollars of preferred, which would unlock hundreds of dollars of value per share." He continued, "Greenlight believes additional value may be realized when Apple's price-to-earnings multiple expands, as the market appreciates a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy."
In truth, Mr. Einhorn's proposal is a lot more long-term thinking than just pressing Apple to distribute a special one-time dividend or pursue a series of stock buybacks; his proposal requires shareholders to remain so as to reap the dividends the special "iPrefs" would throw off. But make no mistake, Mr. Einhorn is also hoping that Apple's common shares will jump in price if Apple takes up his proposal.
Mr. Einhorn declined to comment for this column.
I've had my own run-ins with Mr. Lipton. In 2008, before the financial crisis, I wrote a column questioning Mr. Lipton's various efforts "to stiff-arm the people who actually own the company." At the time, he wrote a memo arguing that the "limits on executive compensation, splitting the role of chairman and C.E.O. and efforts to impose shareholder referendums on matters that have been the province of boards should be resisted."
As the inventor of the anti-takeover maneuver called the "poison pill" and as one who has made a career trying to protect boards from agitators, Mr. Lipton was talking his own book. I wrote, "Mr. Lipton's advice isn't just wrongheaded. It's dangerous."
But nearly five years later, with the perspective of the financial crisis, Mr. Lipton's underlying worry that certain shareholders will abuse the powers of democracy is not unfounded. The question, as is often the case, is whether the influence of a few interested in the short term overwhelms the best interests of the many in the long term.

HEADLINE: Continuing the Conversation on Paid Parental Leave

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: The Times would like you to share your employer&#8217;s policy on paid parental leave. 

 BODY:
Dozens of readers wrote to us with their company's parental leave polices after reading the Your Money column, which discussed how American public and private organizations offer the least generous paid leave policies in the world. 
Some readers were stunned that even the largest companies offered so little paid time off, especially during a newborn's critical early months when nursing can benefit both mother and child. Several Canadian readers, whose a country has a more liberal policy, chimed in with their thoughts and went as far as calling the American way barbaric. Other readers agonized about how to make sure their infants will be cared for when they return to work, while others viewed child care as the individual parent's problem.
So we've decided to begin a progress report that will highlight employers' paid parental leave policies (similar to the way we keep track of companies that equalize the cost of health insurance for same-sex couples). We started with responses we received from some of the largest companies, which we've listed in a chart.
But we'd like to expand the chart over time so that it becomes a repository of sorts, highlighting the most and least generous policies. So please tell us about your own employer's policy with the form below, or in the comment section.
Here's a sampling of recent comments from readers:
Christine, from Toronto, wrote:
From where we stand in Canada, the lack of maternity leave makes Americans look like barbarians. Here we pay a small portion of our pay into unemployment insurance and after a child is born the mother can take up to a year off and earn up to 55% of her pay up to a maximum amount of about $1500 the month. The father can take a portion of this leave instead of the mother if necessary. Guess what - people are still having on average of 2 children per family and our economy is not falling apart...
AnnieOmaha, NE, said:
As one can see by many comments here, this country is dysfunctional when it comes to working and having families. Yes, new parents should be given generous family leave packages, their children are someday going to drive our economy, funding Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid (or what ever form of benefits exist). It's fine if you don't want to have children, but who do you think will replace retiring people? The sad, bad joke is the notion, put forward by many conservatives, that the USA cares about "family values."
And Criordan, from Brooklyn, wrote:
The Walt Disney Company: FMLA unpaid leave only. Zero paid leave. Ironic for a company whose main customer base are families with children.

HEADLINE: Top Deal Maker Returns to the Law

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: James C. Woolery is leaving JPMorgan Chase to join Cadwalader. | The recent spate of deals has come as the stock market hits record levels. | The latest round of financing for Warby Parker attracted two prominent names. | The old Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been crippled by 21st-century finance. 

 BODY:
James C. Woolery, the co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase, said on Sunday that he was leaving the bank after two years to become deputy chairman of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. In his new job, Mr. Woolery, who joined JPMorgan following 17 years at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, is a potential successor to the current chairman of Cadwalader, W. Christopher White, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports. His departure from JPMorgan leaves Chris Ventresca as sole head of the North American mergers division.
Mr. Woolery said he became convinced that Cadwalader "really had a desire to go in a direction I'd wanted to go." After laying off scores of lawyers as its practice of advising on complex debt offerings dried up, the 221-year-old Cadwalader is looking to move further into the top ranks of advisers on corporate and regulatory matters, rather than try to compete with firms that offer a "supermarket" model. In his career as an investment banker, Mr. Woolery worked on AT&T's attempted takeover of T-Mobile USA and the $24.4 billion proposed buyout of Dell.
"Mr. Woolery's decision to try his hand at banking marked him as one of a handful of top deal lawyers to do so," Mr. de la Merced writes. 
MINDFUL OF BUBBLES AS DEAL-MAKING REVIVES | The recent spate of deals has come as the stock market hits record levels. That would seem to contradict the investing adage of "buy low and sell high," James B. Stewart writes in his column for The New York Times. "You always see a lot of M.&A. activity when the market is overvalued," said Matthew Rhodes-Kropf, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. "Of course, you only know a market peak with benefit of hindsight. But when you look back, you'll see a lot of M.&A. activity."
The safest deals may come at the start of a boom. Early in the merger cycle, "You typically buy companies that are in the same industry or where there's a fit," said Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group. "As you get further along in an economic expansion, confidence gets higher and higher, and people start buying almost anything that they think has prospects."
So what is behind the enthusiasm? "The simple answer may be that chief executives and corporate boards don't seem to be any better at detecting market peaks than anyone else," Mr. Stewart writes. "They also experience the same psychological factors that afflict nearly all investors caught up in a bubble."
WARBY PARKER ADDS PROMINENT INVESTORS | Millard S. Drexler, the chief executive of J. Crew, and American Express joined the latest round of financing for the eyeglass seller Warby Parker, which closed at $41.5 million last month, Mr. de la Merced reports. The new investors underscore the growing popularity of the three-year-old Warby Parker, whose backers include General Catalyst Partners, Spark Capital, Tiger Global Management, Thrive Capital and Menlo Ventures. "We've tried to be very deliberate in getting people with specific expertise," Neil Blumenthal, one of Warby Parker's founders, said in an interview. "Nobody knows retail like Mickey.

FALL OF THE BANKING HOUSE OF SIENA | Over its 541-year history, the bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been a mainstay of the city where it is based, backing charities and civic works.

The chairman, Alessandro Profumo, a prominent banking executive who once led UniCredit, said Monte dei Paschi was undone in part by its dealings with large international banks like JPMorgan Chase. "Clearly, many investment banks made a lot of money on Monte dei Paschi," he said. "I would say too much money." The bank's troubles have political ramifications, becoming an issue in the Italian elections held on Sunday and Monday.

HEADLINE: Cadwalader Attracts a Top Deal Maker

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: James C. Woolery is leaving JPMorgan Chase to join Cadwalader. | The recent spate of deals has come as the stock market hits record levels. | The latest round of financing for Warby Parker attracted two prominent names. | The old Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been crippled by 21st-century finance. 

 BODY:
James C. Woolery, the co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase, said on Sunday that he was leaving the bank after two years to become deputy chairman of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. In his new job, Mr. Woolery, who joined JPMorgan following 17 years at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, is a potential successor to the current chairman of Cadwalader, W. Christopher White, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports. His departure from JPMorgan leaves Chris Ventresca as sole head of the North American mergers division.
Mr. Woolery said he became convinced that Cadwalader "really had a desire to go in a direction I'd wanted to go." After laying off scores of lawyers as its practice of advising on complex debt offerings dried up, the 221-year-old Cadwalader is looking to move further into the top ranks of advisers on corporate and regulatory matters, rather than try to compete with firms that offer a "supermarket" model. In his career as an investment banker, Mr. Woolery worked on AT&T's attempted takeover of T-Mobile USA and the $24.4 billion proposed buyout of Dell.
"Mr. Woolery's decision to try his hand at banking marked him as one of a handful of top deal lawyers to do so," Mr. de la Merced writes. 
MINDFUL OF BUBBLES AS DEAL-MAKING REVIVES | The recent spate of deals has come as the stock market hits record levels. That would seem to contradict the investing adage of "buy low and sell high," James B. Stewart writes in his column for The New York Times. "You always see a lot of M.&A. activity when the market is overvalued," said Matthew Rhodes-Kropf, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. "Of course, you only know a market peak with benefit of hindsight. But when you look back, you'll see a lot of M.&A. activity."
The safest deals may come at the start of a boom. Early in the merger cycle, "You typically buy companies that are in the same industry or where there's a fit," said Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group. "As you get further along in an economic expansion, confidence gets higher and higher, and people start buying almost anything that they think has prospects."
So what is behind the enthusiasm? "The simple answer may be that chief executives and corporate boards don't seem to be any better at detecting market peaks than anyone else," Mr. Stewart writes. "They also experience the same psychological factors that afflict nearly all investors caught up in a bubble."
WARBY PARKER ADDS PROMINENT INVESTORS | Millard S. Drexler, the chief executive of J. Crew, and American Express joined the latest round of financing for the eyeglass seller Warby Parker, which closed at $41.5 million last month, Mr. de la Merced reports. The new investors underscore the growing popularity of the three-year-old Warby Parker, whose backers include General Catalyst Partners, Spark Capital, Tiger Global Management, Thrive Capital and Menlo Ventures. "We've tried to be very deliberate in getting people with specific expertise," Neil Blumenthal, one of Warby Parker's founders, said in an interview. "Nobody knows retail like Mickey. And within financial services, nobody knows a brand more prominent than American Express."
ON THE AGENDA | George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, is questioned by the Parliamentary Banking Standards Commission at 10:45 a.m. Lowe's reports earnings before the market opens, while Stifel Financial reports earnings on Monday evening. Roger Altman, chairman of Evercore Partners, is on CNBC at 7:30 a.m. The Dallas Fed manufacturing survey is out at 10:30 a.m.

HEADLINE: Chairman of Barnes & Noble Planning Offer for Its Stores, but Not Nook

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Leslie Kaufman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
7:55 p.m. | Updated Leonard S. Riggio has spent nearly his entire career building Barnes & Noble into the biggest name in book chains.
Now, Mr. Riggio, the company's 71-year-old chairman, is readying a bid to buy the struggling bookseller's 689 stores in an effort to save them from a stormy future in the public markets.
The plan by Mr. Riggio, disclosed in a securities filing on Monday, highlights how relentless competition from online sellers and elsewhere, which has demolished much of the traditional book-selling industry, continues to hound Barnes & Noble. 
The move would effectively cleave the retail arm, which established itself over four decades as the industry's giant, from Nook Media, the e-book division that investors and analysts had believed would usher the retailer into the Internet era. The Nook has been beaten badly by Amazon.com's Kindle and the iPad in sales.
Earlier this month, the company's retail unit reported a 10.9 percent drop in holiday sales, while its Nook unit disclosed a 12.6 percent decrease. The retailer has said that it plans to close about 15 unprofitable stores a year, replacing them much more slowly.
While Mr. Riggio has often speculated to associates for years about potentially taking at least some of the company private, he appeared to become serious about buying its stores only in the last few weeks, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Investors appeared pleased by the prospect, as the company's shares jumped 11.5 percent on Monday, to $15.06. That values the retailer at $901.1 million -- half of the roughly $1.8 billion valuation that Nook Media fetched from investors last year.
It's unclear how much Mr. Riggio would offer for the retail arm, which accounted for half of the company's second-quarter revenue. Analyst estimates of the division's worth on Monday ranged from $484.5 million to more than $1 billion.
While Barnes & Noble has weighed the possibility of selling the Nook division before, few appetizing options have materialized. An analyst at Forrester Research, James L. McQuivey, argued that the company had little ability to command a top-drawer price for its legacy business.
''Making a bet on bookstores now, when we don't know what the ultimate footprint of those stores will be, will require getting a really great price,'' Mr. McQuivey said.
But a person close to the company suggested that Barnes & Noble would be hard pressed to accept anything short of $1 billion.
Should Mr. Riggio make an offer, which would very likely be mostly in cash, he would face one of his biggest challenges since buying a single troubled bookshop in Manhattan and turning it into a national empire.
Mr. Riggio has watched the rise of Amazon as a lower-priced competitor, which has beaten its profits and shares down, while smaller rivals like the Borders Group eventually went out of business.
Still, he repeatedly emphasized that Barnes & Noble understood that the future lay in digital sales, and introduced the Nook in 2009 to show that it could compete with its much younger rival.
The Nook drew in as investors Microsoft and the British publisher Pearson, which collectively bought a 23 percent stake last year. And the division's various offerings have won praise from critics, some of whom recommended the devices over Amazon's.
But in three years after the first device was sold, the Nook still trails the Kindle, the iPad and other tablets. Barnes & Noble warned earlier this month that the division's losses will have grown from the previous year, not decreased.
An analyst at Credit Suisse, Gary Balter, described Nook Media in a research note on Monday as ''money-losing and increasingly poorly positioned.''
Analysts said that a separation of the company's businesses could make sense. Supporting the enormous costs of Nook Media has long weighed on the retail arm, and eliminating that could help profitability.
''What I suspect we are seeing is that the current management brought in to develop the Nook has been distracted from the stores,'' said Mike Shatzkin, the founder of Idea Logical, a media consulting firm. ''And I am sure Mr. Riggio said to himself, 'I can do this better.' ''
Book publishers also said that they welcome any move that would keep Barnes & Noble afloat, which would give them some negotiating leverage with Amazon over book prices. Physical bookstores also serve as a crucial way for readers to decide on new titles.
''Publishers and the public benefit from a healthy competitive market with many choices for readers who want to buy books in print or digital form,'' David Steinberger, the chief executive of Perseus Books Group, wrote in an e-mail. ''Given the volatility of the public markets, taking this kind of business private will be a positive step for publishers and readers.''
But Barnes & Noble executives are concerned that a separation could leave Nook Media cut off from the cash flow it depends on, according to the person close to the company. Any deal would most likely include an agreement to keep featuring Nook devices in Barnes & Noble bookstores, analysts said.
Barnes & Noble said that a special committee of its board, led by Patricia L. Higgins, would evaluate any proposal. Those directors have retained Evercore Partners and the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison as advisers. Mr. Riggio is working with the Peter J. Solomon Company.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Virtual March Will Push For Immigration Changes

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
High-tech leaders including the former heads of AOL and Mozilla are organizing a ''virtual march for immigration reform'' aimed at pressing lawmakers to enact sweeping changes to immigration laws. The effort unveiled Monday is focused on making it easier for the United States to attract highly educated immigrants and those aiming to work in high-tech fields. Silicon Valley leaders and others have long complained of the difficulties of bringing high-tech workers to the United States and allowing them to stay, and immigration legislation taking shape on Capitol Hill is expected to address the issue. The new effort, backed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York's Partnership for a New American Economy, aims to collect supporters and organize a date this spring for them to flood lawmakers' offices via Twitter, Facebook and other means.

HEADLINE: With Rent Ever Higher, An Irish Pub Is Giving Up

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
In a neighborhood where shiny outposts of big-name retailers have displaced the little stores and restaurants where everybody seemed to know everybody else, a longtime holdout is finally planning a last last call.
The Emerald Inn, which survived on Columbus Avenue as the Upper West Side reinvented itself as a pricier and pricier neighborhood, will close on April 30, the owners said.
''It's rent,'' said Charlie Campbell, whose grandfather opened the Emerald Inn during World War II. ''It's really sad.'' 
The monthly payment would have come to $35,000 if the lease had been renewed, he said. He has been paying $17,500 a month under a deal worked out in 2011.
Mike Clarke, an owner of the A.J. Clarke Real Estate Corporation, which manages the apartment building that houses the Emerald Inn, would not discuss the exact amount the landlord had sought for a lease renewal. But he did not dispute Mr. Campbell's figures.
Mr. Clarke said the storefront the Emerald Inn has occupied since Franklin D. Roosevelt was president and Fiorello H. La Guardia was mayor would become a Kate Spade clothing store. It will be the chain's third shop in Manhattan.
The Emerald, as its regulars call it, has come close to closing before. In 2009, there was talk of a final goodbye, but because the recession was deepening and new tenants were suddenly in short supply, Mr. Campbell managed to negotiate a rent increase he could handle.
A couple of other old-time Irish bars in the neighborhood have struggled against the same daunting economics.
Malachy's Donegal Inn, at 103 West 72nd Street, faced a March 1 closing date but won a reprieve and will remain open at least through the end of the year. Another Irish pub in the same block of West 72nd Street, P.D. O'Hurley's, closed last month. A sign on the window said it was moving to 250 West 72nd Street, between Broadway and West End Avenue. But that storefront was dark on Monday. Its Web site, which was live just last week, appeared to have been disconnected.
''It's to the point where anybody who's still left is paying an exorbitant amount of money,'' Mr. Campbell said.
The Emerald's regulars have their memories:
Of the Christmas Eve scene in the movie ''The Apartment'' that was filmed there. (One thing led to another after Hope Holiday pelted Jack Lemmon with straw-paper wrappers.)
Of the time Hugh Downs's secretary walked in with a copy of Bartender magazine. (Mike Campbell, Charlie Campbell's father, said he had thrown out his copy without bothering to read it. The secretary pointed to an article quoting Mr. Downs on his favorite bars. ''He had picked someplace in Africa,'' Mike Campbell said, ''and the Emerald Inn.'')
Of the time the bass-baritone Bryn Terfel sang ''Danny Boy.'' Of star turns by the likes of Regis Philbin, Liam Neeson and Howard Stern. Of stars who sat at the bar, reading a book, and were left alone. (James Gandolfini, when ''The Sopranos'' was still new.)
Of network-news expense accounts that once seemed limitless. ''They can't afford to go out in this area anymore,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''They can't afford to spend $8 for a drink, $9 for a drink.''
Of ''The Pint Man,'' a 2010 novel that involves a love story and a lot of scenes in a bar that seemed to be the Emerald in everything but name.
''I'm devastated,'' said Steve Rushin, the sportswriter who wrote ''The Pint Man.'' And no wonder. The Emerald was where he had his first date with Rebecca Lobo, then a women's basketball star.
''We met at the Dublin House'' -- another Irish bar on the Upper West Side -- ''but I thought I'd class it up by taking her to the Emerald Inn,'' he said. ''It was like a home away from home, an extension of people's apartments. If you have a one-room apartment, this was like the front room. I remember sitting in that second booth on the right, waiting for the woman who is now my wife to walk through that swinging door.''
Michael Morfit, an investment banker and youth lacrosse coach, said the Emerald's closing would be another sad moment for the neighborhood. ''We've lost a lot of the traditional places around here,'' he said, standing at the bar on a recent afternoon. ''I see people who'd come here and they say, 'Where are we going to go now?'''
Charlie Campbell said he was looking for a new storefront on a side street. His 24-year-old son, Charles III, who was tending the bar on a recent afternoon, said he had taken the licensing test to be a plumber.
''As a backup,'' Charles III said, in case the search for a new place drags on.
For his part, Mr. Clarke, the managing agent, said he was sorry to see the Campbells leave.
''They're very nice people,'' he said. ''We've had a wonderful relationship.'' But he said the two sides were too far apart on money this time around.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Banks Fear Court Ruling In Argentina Bond Debt

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
A fierce battle between the government of Argentina and hedge funds and other investors led by a group of hedge funds has already led to the seizure of a naval ship and dragged in the United States Treasury. Now a federal appeals court is hearing the dispute, and how it rules could have a major impact on world debt markets.
The investors -- including the hedge fund tycoon Paul E. Singer -- sued Argentina seeking payment for $1.3 billion relating to bonds that the country defaulted on in 2001. On Wednesday, the case comes before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which has already sided with the hedge funds on their main arguments.
But the issue that the appeals court is still undecided about is perhaps the most important. It involves devising a method to pressure Argentina to pay up on the disputed bonds. And that has left the investors who hold a majority of Argentina's foreign debt vulnerable, as well as the banks that process the payments to those investors. 
While the hedge funds have grabbed the headlines -- winning a temporary court order to seize an Argentine naval ship docked in Ghana, for example -- most of the other holders of Argentina's nearly $100 billion in defaulted debt agreed over the last decade to accept new bonds, taking big losses in the process. The country has since faithfully paid on the exchange bonds.
At the same time, Argentina has vehemently repeated that it will not pay the hedge funds and other holders of its old debt and has passed laws forbidding the government from paying anything to the bondholders who didn't participate in the exchanges.
But last year, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that if Argentina wanted to pay the holders of the restructured debt, it would have to pay the hedge funds and other holders of the defaulted debt, too. The judge included third-party banks in his injunction, and prohibited them from processing payments to holders of the exchange bonds unless all debt holders were paid.
Large banks, investors and the United States Treasury Department have objected to the judge's order. In short, they say, using the sanction could cause financial losses for innocent bystanders and lead to unnecessary disruption in the bond markets.
''They are trying to block the payments system,'' said Vladimir Werning, executive director for Latin American research at JPMorgan Chase. ''This is unprecedented in the New York jurisdiction.''
In an e-mail, Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, which handles bond payments, said the ruling, ''will create unrest in the credit markets and result in cascades of litigation, which is precisely the opposite effect that an injunction should have.''
A ruling in favor of the hedge funds would also have ripple effects throughout the debt markets.
''Any time you have something that can change of balance of power, it can matter beyond Argentina,'' said Robert Kahn, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Despite the legal worries, investors have so far been keen to hold higher-yielding emerging markets debt, given that interest rates are so low. Apart from Argentine bonds, debt issued by developing countries has performed strongly.
Unlike Argentina, some countries have held their noses and cut deals with holdouts in the past to get on with important economic overhauls, most recently Greece on certain smaller foreign-law bonds.
And in the years since Argentina's default, most sovereign bonds have special clauses in them that make it much harder for holdouts to succeed. These are called collective action clauses, which state that if a certain majority of bondholders agree to take losses in a bond restructuring, those losses would be forced on all bondholders, even would-be holdouts who don't agree.
But large amounts of bonds, those issued more than 10 years ago, do not have collective action clauses. And those that do have the clauses may not act as intended if the holdouts win their Argentina case, said Mr. Werning of JPMorgan.
Right now, a bond with a collective action clause might get restructured if 75 percent of the holders agree to it. If Judge Griesa's ruling is upheld, more bondholders might be reluctant to enter a restructuring and the required majority might not be achieved. Bondholders might not enter the restructuring because they fear holdout litigation depriving them of payments later on.
''This could adversely affect the level of participation in a swap,'' Mr. Werning said.
Still, others contend that the market for sovereign debt may be improved if the judge's ruling is upheld, with the sanction on payments banks mostly intact. Countries like Argentina, they say, have taken advantage of the fact that there is no bankruptcy regime in the sovereign debt market to allow creditors to recoup money in a default. Indeed, Judge Griesa has said the Argentina case is partly about creating safeguards for creditors in the absence of bankruptcy regime.
But Anna Gelpern,a professor at the Washington College of Law at the American University, said that if the federal court's rulings are upheld, it might just end up underscoring the limitations of the American courts' power.
''What if Argentina still doesn't settle? How does the court look then?'' she said. ''It can only isolate Argentina and Argentina seems content to be isolated.''
While there is a chance that the appellate court's decision could be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, it is more likely that its ruling will be the final word on the lower court order.
According to that order, if a bank chose to channel payments from Argentina to the owners of the restructured debt, the bank would not be in compliance with his order. A payments bank, Bank of New York Mellon in the case of Argentine exchange bonds, would then decline to process the exchange bond payments, and the bonds could fall into default, inflicting big losses on their holders.
Some market specialists have raised the prospect that Argentina could keep paying the exchange bondholders by avoiding payments banks that operate in the United States. It could, for instance, swap the exchange bonds for new instruments registered under Argentine law that make payments through an Argentine entity.
But the court may decide that, in such a situation, the exchange bondholders themselves would be breaking its injunction. One of the things the appeals court is looking into is how to determine which third parties should sit outside the reach of the district court's ruling.
It is not just hedge funds who are hoping to gain from an affirmation of the lower court ruling. This group also includes many individual investors, who are now feeling more optimistic about getting their money back as the case comes before the appeals court.
''We are hopeful the ruling will stay as issued,'' said Horacio Vázquez, who helps lead a group in Buenos Aires that represents bondholders.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ikea Recalls Meatballs After Detection Of Horse Meat

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS and STEPHEN CASTLE; Stephen Castle reported from London, and Andrew Higgins from Brussels.

 BODY:
LONDON -- The furniture giant Ikea joined a growing list of brands that have been touched by Europe's food scandal on Monday and withdrew its signature Swedish meatballs from its markets and cafeterias across most of Europe after one batch was found to contain traces of horse meat.
Ikea's decision -- which followed a recall by the Swiss food maker Nestlé last week -- demonstrated that even closely guarded brand names have found themselves vulnerable. 
In weeks of tracing the problem, European Union and national officials have conceded that their oversight had not been aimed at authenticating food products. Now that governments and companies have undertaken more extensive testing, the results appear to indicate that food adulteration may be more commonplace and widespread than previously believed.
''Clearly there has been fraud on a massive scale across multiple countries in the E.U.,'' Simon Coveney, the agriculture minister for Ireland, which holds the union's rotating presidency, told a news conference after a meeting with colleagues in Brussels on Monday.
Noting that ''big brands and big names that people trust'' have been caught up in the issue, Mr. Coveney said, ''We are all eager to get to the bottom of this.''
The detection of horse meat, which began in Ireland and spread quickly, has raised questions about the quality and oversight of Europe's complex chain of slaughterhouses, processed meat producers, distributors and retailers.
Already millions of products have been withdrawn, and new cases of adulteration are being discovered almost daily, involving some of the best-known food makers -- including Findus and Iglo -- and most prominent supermarket chains.
Ikea's announcement underlined how few retailers can rest easy as more scrutiny is applied. The recall risks denting the homely Scandinavian image of Ikea, one of Sweden's best-known companies.
A traditional part of Swedish cuisine, meatballs are consumed in huge quantities -- 150 million a year, according to the company's Web site -- by customers in Ikea cafeterias and are also sold for consumption at home.
The company said its action concerned meatballs manufactured by one supplier in Sweden and applies to all European countries except Norway and Russia and to a limited number of products in Switzerland and Poland. The United States is not affected, the company said.
Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, an investment banking company in London, said that Ikea's announcement was ''another left-field random outcome of the whole situation. Did Ikea want to sell horse meat? No. Have they been caught out by rogue elements? Yes.''
''The breadth with which contamination has been found clearly shows that there has been substantial rogue activity,'' he added.
Ikea first said that it would not sell or serve any meatballs at its stores in Sweden after the Czech authorities detected horse meat in frozen meatballs that were labeled beef and pork, even though Ikea's own tests two weeks ago had not detected horse DNA.
The company also said it was stopping sales in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, France, Britain, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Ireland. The meatballs were produced by Ikea's main supplier of the product, a Swedish company called Familjen Dafgard.
In a statement later in the day, Anders Lennartsson, a spokesman for Ikea Food Services, said, ''We take seriously the test result from the Czech Republic authorities, indicating presence of horse meat in one batch of our meatballs.''
Results of DNA tests conducted by the food industry in Britain, released last week, showed that 1 percent of beef products were tainted with horse meat. But that news was offset by the discovery of tainted beef products destined for school meals in Scotland.
And, while the issue is primarily seen as one of fraud and mislabeling, there is concern that a powerful equine painkiller, phenylbutazone, or bute, may have entered the food chain.
''It started off as a local problem, then became national, then international,'' said Chris Elliott, the director of the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen's University Belfast. ''At the last count, something like 19 countries were involved either in the supply chain or in uncovering tainted products.''
Mr. Elliott highlighted the complexity of the supply chain for processed food as a big factor in the loss of quality control. Horse meat is significantly cheaper than beef, so unscrupulous individuals can profit from the substitution, he said.
''Wherever you have a high-value product and you can substitute it for a lower-value product, people will try to do so,'' he said. ''that's the history of the food industry, unfortunately.''
The evidence suggested that cases were widespread and included the substitution of pork for beef, as producers sought to lower costs.
The most likely solution is either an increase in DNA testing, which is expensive, or a simplification of the supply chain to enable better controls.
''Either way, there is going to be a substantial additional cost in food production,'' Mr. Elliott said.
Ikea's announcement came as European Union ministers gathered to discuss changes to a farm subsidy program, but their meeting was swamped by the meat crisis.
Desperate to restore consumer confidence, ministers at the meeting spoke in favor of extending European Union rules on food labeling. Since 2011, labels on unprocessed beef sold in Europe have been required to identify where a cow was born, raised and slaughtered; most countries now want this requirement extended to processed beef. This could prove cumbersome, as processed food contents often originate in multiple countries.
Tonio Borg, Europe's commissioner for health and consumer policy, told the news conference that place-of-origin labeling for processed foods would not have stopped those intent on fraudulently passing off horse as beef. ''The problem is not an absence of regulations,'' he said.
He said that the European Commission, the union's policy-making arm, would accelerate a report on labeling issues that was originally due at the end of the year. Once the report is done it will take months for its findings to be turned into legislation.

HEADLINE: Two Key Foreign Policy Openings for Obama

BYLINE: By IAN BREMMER and DAVID GORDON

 BODY:
TOKYO -- During a visit to the White House last Friday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan reportedly discussed two opportunities with President Obama that should be high on his broader second-term foreign policy agenda: A massive multinational trade deal and access to America's newly abundant shale gas. Abe hopes that improving U.S.-Japanese ties will help his country win negotiating concessions on the trade deal and new energy supplies.
Whatever the direction of Washington's relations with Tokyo, Abe's interest should make clear for the president that these are two of America's most formidable assets in re-establishing U.S. influence around the world. 
Obama scored notable victories in the war on Al Qaeda during his first term, but he also began to move U.S. security policy beyond counterterrorism toward a focus on making the country more secure by making it more prosperous. With this in mind, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid the groundwork for a new form of economic statecraft, one guided by recognition that expanded trade and investment ties have never been more important for national strength and resilience.
Obama must translate this vision into policies that extend U.S. influence abroad and spur economic growth at home. The two most important tools now at his disposal are the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership and the opportunity to expand the export of America's newly abundant supply of liquefied natural gas. These tools, products of U.S. faith in market-driven capitalism and the innovation it enables, should be central components of the president's second-term foreign policy.
There are two reasons why Pacific partnership is so important. First, trade will be crucial for U.S. growth, and this deal is as big as they come. Negotiations now include the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. If Japan joins the talks, the group would represent 40 percent of world trade and 40 percent of global G.D.P. It is a geostrategic game-changer.
Second, the Pacific partnership is the right answer to China's state-driven capitalism. China's rise has created important challenges for the United States and its economy, in particular by empowering a system of state capitalism that gives political officials a powerful role in directing market activity. By using state-owned companies, state-run banks, and privately owned but politically reliable national champions to achieve political goals, China has made it much more difficult for U.S. and other foreign companies to compete.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership can help counter the growth of state capitalism and extend U.S. influence in the Pacific in much the same way that potential E.U. membership once encouraged reform in former Warsaw Pact countries, states that might otherwise have followed a familiar path of least resistance back toward state-run economics and authoritarian rule.
This trade pact is not an attempt to contain China or stunt its growth. Instead, it is an enormous investment in the future of free markets -- and an invitation to China's neighbors to share the benefits of free trade while deepening their political and security relationships with Washington. It is also a signal that America intends to remain in Asia as a stabilizing force, even as China becomes a more influential economic and security player, in the region and beyond.
Hurdles must be cleared on regulatory and agricultural issues if Pacific partnership members are to complete talks by their stated October deadline, and Obama can provide crucial momentum. By publicly highlighting his prioritization of the Pacific partnership and personally pressing Abe to join the bargaining, he will signal to both current and potential members that he is ready to spend political capital at home to make the partnership a reality.
Washington will have to compromise on key provisions of the deal, but the Pacific partnership will provide the United States with something it badly needs: A secure and lasting foothold for liberal trade, investment, and regulatory principles in the world's most economically promising region, one that might otherwise remain frozen in China's lengthening state capitalist shadow. With a parallel agreement brewing with the European Union, Obama has a golden opportunity to reshape the global trade and investment landscape to better serve U.S. interests and enhance growth prospects at home.
The shale revolution creates a similar opportunity. The unprecedented growth in U.S. gas production brought about by changes in drilling and extraction technology has triggered a battle in Washington over who should benefit. Refiners, manufacturers and consumers want the benefits of cheap energy for the domestic economy. Producers want to profit from access to new markets both at home and abroad. Under U.S. law, the Department of Energy must find that exports of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., are in the public interest before approving a project. U.S. allies in Europe are hoping for a surge on L.N.G. exports from America that will ease dependence on countries like Russia and Iran.
By giving our friends what they want, the president can promote free-market principles, add significant downward pressure on global gas prices that benefit all consumers, and blunt the market power of Russia and Iran. A decision to green light L.N.G. exports could be written into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would create U.S. leverage for its partners, especially Japan, which has long pushed for access to more U.S.-produced energy.
Perhaps the best reason for Obama to do these things is that they are doable. On questions of budgets and borrowing, immigration reform, gun control, and a dozen other hot topics, Democrats and Republicans stand miles apart. But if the president will devote time, energy and political capital to a trade deal that defines the United States as a permanent Pacific power and an energy policy that both redefines America's market potential and tightens the bonds that bind America and its allies, he will have enough votes from the two parties -- and the support he needs from U.S. business leaders -- to make both happen.
He will also have established a foreign policy legacy worthy of the name.

HEADLINE: Italian Moments

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Italian paradox: An important election is held and the public seems uninterested. The economic numbers say crisis, yet Italians seem unperturbed. Why?
When I lived in Rome I found that two Italian expressions were central to understanding the country. The first was ''Se non è vero, è ben trovato'' -- roughly ''If it is not true, it is well observed,'' or, more loosely, ''If it is not true it damn well ought to be.''
The line between truth and untruth runs blurry in Italy, stripped of Anglo-Saxon exactitude. Truth is readily sacrificed on the altars of beauty and fantasy. Difficult realities are circumvented. 
The second was ''Il potere logora chi non ce l'ha'' -- ''Power wears out those who do not have it.'' The phrase, a favorite of Giulio Andreotti, the owlish Christian Democrat survivor, said much about the view that moralizing folk fixated on right and wrong are at heart just envious of the powerful.
A city like Rome that once ran an empire is bound to the daily contemplation of gilded palaces given over to diminished business. Freed of any obligation to administer or protect the world, but living with glorious architectural reminders of that time, Italians seemed to me wise in their pessimism about human nature, their knowledge that everything passes in the end, and their celebration of ephemeral pleasures.
Those were Cold War days. Italian elections were serious affairs, watched with some foreboding by the myriad folk up at the U.S. Embassy. Not only did they watch, they sought to influence the outcome. Italy was the soft underbelly of the West where the Communist Party might enter government. It never did.
By comparison, the Italian election unfolding as I write is a geostrategic minnow. Markets are worried, but then markets always are.
Silvio Berlusconi -- a man enamored of power and dismissive of truth -- has been doing his number. Beppe Grillo, an ex-comedian, has been making crazy promises about a 30-hour week that seem to have won over up to 20 percent of Italians. Meanwhile, the serious center-left represented by Pier Luigi Bersani and the outgoing prime minister, Mario Monti, has been making its case for cuts and needed reforms.
The spectacle, overall, has not been edifying. The temptation to dismiss Italy as unserious is always strong. The question is, which Italy? The north, serious to the point of dourness in cities like Turin, or the south, locked in habits of crime and corruption?
Another question is this: Does Italy, in its crisis-defying equanimity, hold lessons for us all? Last time I was there, three months ago, I was struck by an enduring humanity that gets lost elsewhere as pressures grow and life accelerates. Where interactions often seem purely transactional in New York or London -- what can you do for me now this minute and if you can't do anything why don't you get out of my way? -- they have an added layer in Rome. Encounters are more lingering. The eye dwells a moment, takes you in, registers your particular existence. These are Italian moments.
This humanity is accompanied by a flexibility that, again, reflects skepticism of hard lines and single truths. Technology is geared to the most efficient result. It can sift immense amounts of data in the instantaneous pursuit of optimization through efficiency. The chip is much less good at adaptability, the weighing of the intangible elements in human affairs. Italy holds the intangible precious in a unique way. Mario Draghi has proved such an adroit governor of the European Central Bank precisely because of this emotional intelligence.
I was talking the other day with my friend Ed Vulliamy of The Observer. He had just returned from the hilltop Tuscan town of Volterra, where he had been interviewing Aniello Arena, a convicted murderer serving a life sentence in the town's prison. Arena is also the star of the award-winning movie, ''Reality,'' by the director Matteo Garrone.
Was it hard, I asked, to get permission to interview Arena? No, Vulliamy said, they went out for a drink at a local café: Arena can leave jail for a few hours every day. Here are a few lines from the fine piece Vulliamy wrote:
''Arena, according to the rather bizarrely agreed rules, must 'check in' to jail at midnight. So we go for a beer, the murderer and I, in a café on a pretty square on the edge of town with a view across the rolling Tuscan hills vanishing into the night. I ask him why he doesn't just escape. 'Why would I do that?' he says. 'Yes, we could be in Holland by tomorrow, but I'd be back in jail again, always afraid, looking around me. As things are, I don't feel like a prisoner any more, just because I go to sleep in a jail. It's all in the head, this so-called reality, freedom, whatever -- all in the head, and in my head, I'm free.'''
Reality in Italy is all in the head. A prisoner is free. Elections come and go. Italy's human difference, thankfully, endures.

HEADLINE: Smartphones Gain Ground in India

BYLINE: By DEVIDUTTA TRIPATHY and HARICHANDAN ARAKALI | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- As BlackBerry introduces the first smartphone from its make-or-break BB10 line in India, one of its most loyal markets, the company faces new competition from a formidable rival that has long had a minimal presence in the country.
More than four years after it started selling iPhones in India, Apple is aggressively pushing the devices with installment payment plans that make it more affordable, a new distribution model and a marketing blitz. 
''Now your dream phone'' at 5,056 rupees, or $94, read a recent full front-page ad for the iPhone 5 in the Times of India, referring to the initial payment on a phone priced at about 45,500 rupees, or almost two months' wages for an entry-level software engineer.
The newfound interest in India suggests a subtle strategy shift for Apple, which has moved tentatively in emerging markets and has allowed rivals like BlackBerry and Samsung Electronics to dominate with more affordable smartphones. With the exception of China, all Apple stores are in advanced economies.
Apple expanded its Indian sales effort in the second half of 2012 by adding two distributors. Previously it had sold iPhones only through a few carriers and stores it calls premium resellers.
The result: Shipments of iPhones to India between October and December nearly tripled to 250,000 units, from 90,000 in the previous quarter, according to an estimate by Jessica Kwee, a Singapore-based analyst at the consulting firm Canalys.
At the MobileStore, an Indian chain owned by the Essar conglomerate, which says it sells 15 percent of the iPhones purchased in the country, iPhone sales tripled between December and January, thanks to a monthly payment program introduced last month.
''Most people in India can't afford a dollar-priced phone when the salaries in India are rupee salaries,'' said Himanshu Chakrawarti, the MobileStore's chief executive. ''But the desire is the same.''
Apple, its distributors, its retailers and banks share the advertising and interest costs of the marketing push, according to Mr. Chakrawarti. Carriers like Bharti Airtel, which also sell the iPhone 5, run separate ads.
India is the world's second-largest cellphone market by number of users, but most Indians cannot afford fancy handsets. Smartphones account for just a tenth of total phone sales. In India, 95 percent of cellphone users have prepaid accounts without fixed contracts. Unlike those in the United States, Indian carriers do not subsidize handsets.
Within the smartphone segment, Apple's Indian market share last quarter was just 5 percent, according to Canalys, meaning its overall penetration is tiny.
Still, the industry research company IDC expects the Indian smartphone market to grow more than five times, to 108 million units in 2016, from about 19 million last year, which presents a big opportunity.
Samsung Electronics dominates Indian smartphone sales with a 40 percent share, thanks to its wide portfolio of Android devices, priced as low as 5,900 rupees. The market has also been flooded with lower-cost Android phones from local brands like Lava and Micromax.
Most smartphones sold in India are much cheaper than the iPhone, said Anshul Gupta, a Gartner analyst: ''Where the masses are -- there, Apple still has a gap.''
Apple helped create the smartphone industry with the iPhone in 2007, but last year it lost its lead globally to Samsung, whose free Android software is especially attractive in Asia. Many in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street believe the surest way to penetrate lower-income Asian markets would be with a lower-cost iPhone, as has been widely reported but never confirmed. The risk is that a lower-cost iPhone would reduce demand for the premium version and eat into Apple's margins.
The new monthly payment plan in India goes a long way toward expanding the potential market, Mr. Chakrawarti said.
''The Apple campaign is not meant for, really, the regular top-end customer; it is meant to upgrade the 10,000-12,000 handset guy to 45,000 rupees,'' he said.
Apple's main focus for expansion in Asia has been Greater China, including Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan, where revenue grew 60 percent last quarter to $7.3 billion.
Asked last year why Apple had not been as successful in India, Timothy D. Cook, the company's chief executive, said that its business in India was growing but that the company remained more focused on other markets.
''I love India, but I believe that Apple has some higher potential in the intermediate term in some other countries,'' Mr. Cook said. ''The multilayer distribution there really adds to the cost of getting products to market.''
Apple, which has partly addressed that situation by adding distributors, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
Ingram Micro, one of its new distributors, also declined to comment. Executives at Redington, the other distributor, could not immediately be reached.
BlackBerry, which has seen its global market share shrivel to 3.4 percent from 20 percent over the past three years, is making what is seen as a last-ditch effort to save itself with the BB10 series.
The high-end BlackBerry Z10, introduced in India on Monday, is expected to be priced not far from the 45,500-rupee price tag for an iPhone 5 with 16 gigabytes of memory. The Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note 2, the Nokia Lumia 920 and two HTC models are the main iPhone rivals.
Until last year, BlackBerry had a market share of more than 10 percent in India, thanks to a push into the consumer segment with lower-priced phones. Last quarter, its share fell to about 5 percent, according to Canalys, just ahead of Apple.

HEADLINE: Pound Falls Against Dollar and Euro on U.K. Downgrade

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
LONDON -- The pound fell to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar and a 16-month low against the euro on Monday, the first trading day after the loss of Britain's prized triple-A credit rating. 
Analysts said more declines were likely in the near term, given a grim outlook for the British economy and growing evidence that the Bank of England is comfortable with a falling currency as it seeks to rebalance the economy and encourage more exports.
Moody's Investors Service on Friday cut Britain's credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa, citing weak prospects for economic growth.
Britain joined the United States and France in having lost its triple-A rating from at least one major agency.
Sterling fell as low as $1.5073, its weakest since mid-July 2010.
So far this year the pound has lost nearly 7 percent against the dollar, while the euro has gained 7.3 percent against the pound.
Ten-year British bonds sold off sharply in early Monday trading but later regained most of their losses.
British stocks were broadly higher, lifted in many cases by prospects of greater exports from a weaker currency.
Britain's finance minister, George Osborne, sought to put a positive spin on the developments in an appearance before Parliament on Monday.
''The credit rating is an important benchmark for any country, but this government's economic policy is tested day in and day out in the market, and it has not been found wanting today,'' said Mr. Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer.
But analysts were less sanguine. The rating cut ''reinforces the perilous economic position the U.K. is in,'' Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex.com, said.
She added that the downgrade might fuel more speculation that the Bank of England will step up its purchases of government bonds -- a measure known as quantitative easing -- as a way of pumping more money into the economy to stimulate it.
More quantitative easing is seen as a negative for the currency as it involves the central bank printing more money to buy bonds. That increases the supply of the currency and puts more pressure on its value.
The pound was already under pressure last week after Bank of England minutes showed policy makers, including its governor, Mervyn A. King, edging closer to another round of easing.
The bank's quarterly report earlier this month also said policy makers were prepared to tolerate higher inflation to support growth.
''By moving the goal post of its 2 percent inflation target from two to three years, the Bank has reduced real rate expectations, markedly pushing the pound lower,'' Morgan Stanley wrote in a note Monday.
''Now rising inflation and pound weakness will pare living standards back down,'' the bank's analysts wrote.

HEADLINE: China Factory Growth Slips From Recent High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Growth in the giant China manufacturing sector in February withdrew from the highest point in nearly two years despite a fourth consecutive month of expansion, a private survey showed Monday, as foreign demand remained unsteady.
The HSBC flash purchasing managers' index for February slipped to 50.4, the lowest reading in four months and down from the January reading of 52.3, which had been the best showing since January 2011. Index readings higher than 50 indicate expansion, while those lower than 50 indicate contraction.
The flash P.M.I. is the earliest indicator of China's economic health each month and should not alter expectations that China, which has the world's second-largest economy, after that of the United States, is enjoying a gentle recovery, experts said. That would be a welcome development for China's new leaders, who take office in March. 
''The underlying strength of the Chinese growth recovery remains intact, as indicated by still-expanding employment and the recent pickup of credit growth,'' said Qu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC.
In line with recent trends, the flash P.M.I. showed demand for Chinese exports wobbling in February. A subindex measuring new export orders slipped to 49.8.
The export sector has been a weak point for the Chinese economy in the past two years, as faltering global economic growth has caused net exports to drag on growth.
Although export growth surged to a 21-month high in January in a sign that business was picking up, most economists say that exporters face continued difficulty as demand from Europe and the United States languishes.
Still, the survey did not suggest that China's factories were re-entering a slowdown. While most P.M.I. subindexes fell in February, they were pulling back from highs of several months, suggesting that manufacturers were only taking a breather.
Some economists may attribute the dip in the February data to the Lunar New Year holiday, which began Feb. 10 this year and fell in January last year, although the survey's publisher, Markit, says the data are seasonally adjusted.
The output subindex fell from a 22-month high; new orders backed away from a 20-month high; factory employment edged down from its highest level in 20 months; input prices fell from a 16-month peak; and output prices slid from a 14-month high.
As in previous months, the February survey showed that domestic demand had held up better than demand from abroad. The new-order subindex remained comfortably above 50, even after falling from its January level.
China holds its annual full-session parliamentary meeting March 5, when the incoming president, Xi Jinping, officially takes the reins of state power, while the departing prime minister, Wen Jiabao, presents the government's 2013 economic goals.
Most analysts believe Beijing will retain its 2012 goal for gross domestic product growth of 7.5 percent for this year, giving itself some room to surpass expectations slightly.
The Chinese economy grew 7.8 percent in 2012, about in line with expectations, but still the slowest rate in 13 years. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the economy to grow 8.1 percent in 2013.
The rebound, though gentle, would comfort investors banking on a modest Chinese economic recovery to lift global growth.
Indeed, February was still the fourth consecutive month in which the flash P.M.I. was above 50, despite the retreat. Before the turnaround that began in November, the index had languished at less than 50 for 12 consecutive months.
The HSBC P.M.I. survey is based on a poll of purchasing executives from more than 420 manufacturing firms. The flash P.M.I. is compiled from responses from 85 percent to 90 percent of that pool. The final results will be published March 1.

HEADLINE: From the Schoolhouse to the Factory Floor, Girding for Cuts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER, FERNANDA SANTOS, TAMAR LEWIN, JULIA PRESTON, JOHN ELIGON, MICHAEL WINES, KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The owner of a Missouri smokehouse that makes beef jerky is worried about a slowdown in food safety inspections. A Montana school district is drawing up a list of teachers who could face layoffs. Officials at an Arizona border station fear that lines to cross the border could lengthen. And if Olympic National Park in Washington cannot hire enough workers to plow backcountry trails, they may stay closed until the snow melts in July.
With some $85 billion in spending cuts -- known as sequestration -- set to begin at the end of the week, officials in Washington were blaming one another. In the rest of the country, local officials, business owners and people who rely on government services were trying to fathom what it would mean for them.
-- MICHAEL COOPER 
THE MILITARY
GROUNDED
At Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, the first casualty of the federal government's spending cuts might seem frivolous: its biennial air show.
But it is a vastly popular spectacle that doubles as an open house for the base, which is about 15 miles west of the center of Phoenix. Some 250,000 people watched it in 2011, gawking from inside and outside the base as fighter jets made impossible maneuvers in the sky. The show was scheduled for mid-March.
''I cannot in good conscience spend some of our limited resources to host an open house while the Defense Department considers potential civilian furloughs,'' Brig. Gen. Michael Rothstein, the commander of the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke, said in announcing the show's cancellation.
The cuts have already led to the postponement of repairs to nonmission equipment and of flying that is not specific to pilot training.
The base employs approximately 1,200 civilian workers; 850 of them could be forced to take 22 days of unpaid leave over the next six months, reducing the payroll by up to 20 percent, officials said. Another option is to reduce the number of flying-training hours, at a base that is one of the nation's prime training grounds for F-16 Fighting Falcon jet pilots.
Luke is one of seven military bases in Arizona, which also has a robust private defense industry. (Raytheon, which builds mission systems in Tucson, and Honeywell, which makes military turbines, are among the state's largest employers.)
At a constituents' meeting last week, Senator John McCain said the cuts could significantly undermine military programs.
''We're facing a situation where our national security is at risk,'' Mr. McCain said, adding that furloughs could affect as many as 49,000 military and defense jobs in Arizona.
-- FERNANDA SANTOS
RESEARCH
BELT-TIGHTENING IN THE LABS
The University of Washington, one of the nation's research giants, gets about $1 billion a year in research money from the federal government, mostly from the National Institutes of Health. And although the spending cuts do not start until Friday, some of that money is already drying up.
''Starting in the fall, because of the budget situation and the uncertainty, N.I.H. has been giving out only 90 percent of each annual award,'' said Mary Lidstrom, the university's vice provost for research.
Dr. Lidstrom estimates that the cuts will cost the university $75 million to $100 million, taking a toll on researchers who will lose part of their multiyear grants and on those whose grant proposals will now remain unfinanced.
''Since we don't know what's going to happen, everybody's been very conservative in hiring post-docs,'' she said. ''And what's starting to happen is that people hired as technicians are being given notice.''
She added: ''It translates to lost jobs and lost opportunities. What I'm most worried about is that it will discourage a whole generation of young people from going into research.''
Dr. Lidstrom, who holds an endowed chair and has financing for research on engineering bacteria for biofuels, said that by moving some endowment money into salaries, she had been able to protect the most vulnerable people in her laboratory, six undergraduates in a training program.
Although the university has an internal bridge program to help researchers through a temporary loss in financing, it is far too small to offset the cuts.
''We usually help about 20 people a year, but nearly 1,000 are going to be affected,'' Dr. Lidstrom said. ''The next deadline to apply is May 1. We're bracing ourselves.''
-- TAMAR LEWIN
CUSTOMS
LIFE IN THE SLOW LANE AT THE MEXICAN BORDER
Guadalupe Ramirez, the director for Customs and Border Protection of the bustling border station at Nogales, Ariz., keeps his operation humming. In the lanes for travelers coming from Mexico -- including returning Americans and also many Mexicans who come to Arizona to shop -- the waiting time in line is down to 30 minutes.
Inspectors under Mr. Ramirez's command are trained to spot a show of nerves, or an unusual lump under clothing that might be a drug package, or an identity document that does not quite match the appearance of the person presenting it.
Last month, through a combination of intuition and surveillance technology, Nogales inspectors caught the largest marijuana shipment ever detected coming in to Arizona -- more than 14,000 pounds packed into a truck.
With the federal spending cuts, waiting times at Nogales could grow to as long as five hours during the day, ''functionally closing those ports during core hours,'' said Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary.
Thousands of inspectors who examine incoming tourists and commercial trucks will face furloughs, slowing trade and making it less likely that an inspector will have the 20 seconds Mr. Ramirez says it takes to spot trouble among the vast flow of people and traffic each day.
-- JULIA PRESTON
AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT
FEWER MEAT INSPECTORS, LESS BEEF JERKY
For more than three decades, Western's Smokehouse, a family-run meat processing operation in rural northeastern Missouri, has specialized in the art of jerky. Its varieties include smoked Mandarin teriyaki beef, smoked pepper beef and smoked original beef.
But now, there is concern at the plant.
The automatic federal spending cuts have raised the possibility that the United States Department of Agriculture will have to furlough some of its meat inspectors. Many plants like Western's are not allowed to operate without inspectors present.
''I'm nervous about it,'' said Kevin Western, the owner of the company, which is based in Greentop, Mo., and was started by his father, Sam, in 1978. ''The livelihood of our business depends on meat inspection.''
Mr. Western said he recently spoke with one of his plant's inspectors about the possibility that some of them would be furloughed or would have to take on more responsibility. There are about a half-dozen meat processing plants in his area, Mr. Western said, and inspectors may be forced to oversee multiple facilities.
Western's has a day shift and a night shift, Mr. Western said, and one federal inspector present during each shift. Without inspectors, the plant would have to halt operations, he said, and he would probably have to send home about 85 percent of his 30-person work force.
''Really, what can you do?'' Mr. Western asked. ''I've heard this for the last six, eight months. Now they're saying it's really serious. I don't really know what to do to brace for it.''
-- JOHN ELIGON
NATIONAL PARKS
'WE'LL CUT WHATEVER WE CAN'
Olympic National Park, a wild patch of mile-high mountains that dominates peninsular Washington west of Seattle, accommodates three million visitors each year on a $12.8 million shoestring. Up to 90 percent of expenses are largely fixed -- permanent employees, insurance, utilities and such -- that cannot be cut without affecting basic operations.
''There isn't a lot of wiggle room here,'' Sarah Creachbaum, the park superintendent since November, said in an interview.
So any federal spending cuts that affect Olympic will, as at other parks, fall on what can be curtailed: services to the public.
Precise cuts are still under discussion, Ms. Creachbaum said. But they will probably include not filling 14 full-time vacancies and 14 of 125 seasonal jobs, like the park's safety and maintenance officers. ''They clean restrooms, mow lawns,'' Ms. Creachbaum said. ''They pick up trash, they give interpretive programs, hand out maps.''
Just the loss of four interpretive rangers who work at visitor centers would reduce park programs for about 35,000 visitors, she said.
Parts of the park will probably open late, like Deer Park Road, an 18-mile asphalt-then-gravel ribbon that is a popular route to the backcountry. Usually plowed clear in late May, the road probably will be closed until snowmelt opens it in mid-July.
Olympic is the sixth most visited of the National Park Service's 398 parks. Cuts can be made, Ms. Creachbaum said, but no more easily than most households with flat incomes can tighten belts by 5 percent. ''We'll do what we can do, like all families,'' she said. ''For the rest of the year, we'll cut whatever we can.''
-- MICHAEL WINES
THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY
TRICKLE-DOWN PROGRAM CUTS
BAE Systems, a global defense and aerospace company, employs 40,000 people in the United States, about 4,600 of them in New Hampshire; BAE is the biggest manufacturer in the state.
The company estimates that spending cuts demanded by Washington could result in the loss of more than 10 percent of its work force, or more than 4,000 employees. It could mean drastic reductions in contracts and in research and development programs. Any cuts would probably trickle down to the 400 contractors in New Hampshire who supply the company with components and parts.
At this point, there is no way to know who might be furloughed or what contracts might be curtailed, said Kristin Gossel, a spokeswoman for BAE. But, she said, the indiscriminate nature of the cuts would be ''devastating'' to the defense industry.
The company's scheduled ship maintenance contracts with the Navy could be delayed or canceled; its vehicle and depot maintenance programs for the Army could be stalled; and many major weapons programs could be delayed.
Another possible cut: a $20 million Aircrew Protection Center in Merrimack, N.H., where it tests and evaluates Infrared Countermeasure systems. These small black boxes, about the size of a toaster, are topped with lasers and placed on helicopters and other aircraft. When a heat-seeking enemy missile is fired at the aircraft, the laser is used to divert it, protecting those onboard. The center allows rigorous testing under demanding conditions that simulate the warlike environment.
-- KATHARINE Q. SEELYE
SCHOOLS
TEACHER LAYOFFS
Dale Lambert, the director of student services for the Great Falls Public Schools in Montana, is trying to solve a complex math problem these days: how to limit the number of teachers he would have to lay off under the automatic federal spending cuts.
The district of just over 10,000 students is vulnerable to impending reductions in a number of federal programs that help support public schools. It is eligible for money for low-income students and those in special-education classes, as well as for money that supports students on Native American reservations and the children of active-duty personnel and civilian workers at Malmstrom Air Force Base.
Mr. Lambert and Cheryl K. Crawley, the superintendent, are braced to present a list of planned layoffs to the school board next month. Twenty teachers could be at risk.
Mr. Lambert said he feared that he would have to raise student-teacher ratios in classes for students with cognitive delays or autism. ''The budget is that narrow and that tight,'' he said.
The challenges reflect others across the country as schools prepare for what could be $2 billion in federal cuts. The Department of Education estimates that more than 10,000 jobs could be affected. That would come on top of the approximately 290,000 local education jobs lost during the recession and its aftermath.
The Great Falls district could take a disproportionately severe hit because of the number of students whose parents work at the Air Force base. Mr. Lambert calculates that job losses at the base would affect about 1,260 students in the district. If half of those families moved out to find jobs elsewhere, the district could be forced to cut about 60 more teaching jobs.

HEADLINE: In Putin's Russia, Shooting the Messenger

BYLINE: By JEFFREY D. KAHN. 
Jeffrey D. Kahn is an associate professor of law at Southern Methodist University. .

 BODY:
DALLAS
WHAT is the difference between Dmitri A. Medvedev and Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's tag-teaming presidents? It's the difference between officially asking experts for unvarnished advice, and punishing those experts for giving it.
In early 2011, when Mr. Medvedev (now prime minister) was still president, the Kremlin's human rights council selected nine experts to scrutinize the 2010 conviction of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was once one of Russia's richest men but is now its best-known political prisoner. I was invited to serve, the one American in a group with six experts from Russia, one from Germany and one from the Netherlands. We did not mince our words criticizing the Khodorkovsky trial.
That December, Russian television showed the council's chairman delivering our findings to Mr. Medvedev, with a recommendation that Mr. Khodorkovsky's conviction be annulled. But then Mr. Putin, who was president from 2000 to 2008 and then bided his time as prime minister, returned to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, for their willingness to speak truth to power, at least four of my Russian counterparts have been questioned in connection with a criminal investigation. The court order used to harass them refers to their ''deliberately false conclusions.'' Talk about killing the messenger. 
You may be surprised to learn that the Kremlin has a human rights agency. Not only has one existed since 1993, but the human rights council, as it is currently known, was active and respected under Mr. Medvedev's presidency. Its membership was a who's who of leading Russian human rights personalities, including Lyudmila M. Alexeyeva, the leader of the Moscow Helsinki Group and a former Soviet dissident.
In the Medvedev years, the council's work had impact. For example, its study of the death in custody of the Russian anti-corruption lawyer Sergei Magnitsky forced the state to reopen its own investigation of the event. The United States Congress cited the council's findings in an act named for Mr. Magnitsky that was passed late last year. That law, which was linked to a lifting of trade restrictions, restricted the ability of the officials responsible for Mr. Magnitsky's death to move themselves or their assets to American shores. Even more remarkably, the council scrutinized the case of Mr. Khodorkovsky, who is still paying the price for daring to finance Mr. Putin's political opponents a decade ago. He was arrested in 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of evading taxes on oil sold by his Yukos oil company. He was dropped into the Russian prison archipelago, and Yukos was lost to a state-owned company. In 2010, as he approached eligibility for parole, he was convicted again, this time for embezzling the oil he was previously convicted of selling on the sly; he remains in prison today. Many have questioned the validity of these charges, their sequential filing, and the fairness of his trials.
My involvement began in April 2011, when I received an e-mail from Tamara Morshchakova, a retired justice of the Russian Constitutional Court; she was heading the council's working group on the case. She asked me to write a report evaluating this second conviction. At the time, I thought this might be a chance to shine sunlight on this shadowy case, and that Mr. Medvedev would be more open to reconsideration than Mr. Putin.
Ms. Morshchakova had written to me: ''The expert analysis is to be conducted on a voluntary basis and on the condition of confidentiality.'' That meant I worked without pay, and without contact with the council, through that spring and summer, before submitting my report.
I now realize that this isolation was a safety precaution, intended to avoid false accusations of expertise-for-hire or collusion. Only when the work of all the experts was personally given to President Medvedev did I learn who else had written reports and what they had said. The six Russians included leaders in the country's top academic institutions and prominent professors with expertise in legal scholarship, economics or both.
But once Mr. Putin switched places last year with Mr. Medvedev, my Russian counterparts began to pay for their too-public public service. Just weeks after Mr. Putin's election last March, a Russian official smeared the council's impartiality, citing charitable donations Yukos made over a decade ago to nongovernmental organizations whose leaders now sit on the council.
Then, shortly after Mr. Putin's inauguration in May, search warrants were issued under the pretext of investigating whether Mr. Khodorkovsky had financed the ''deliberately false conclusions of specialists under the guise of independent public expertise by paying those who organized their production as well as the experts.'' I'm told that, one by one, these experts and people they work with are finding their homes and workplaces searched, their papers and computers seized. They are also being subjected to aggressive questioning.
Meanwhile, many council members, including Ms. Alexeyeva, have resigned in protest of Mr. Putin's return. Their ranks have been restocked and enlarged, but the council now seems a shadow of its former independent-minded self.
Of course, as an American working outside of Russia, I am insulated from the full force of Mr. Putin's wrath. Not so these Russian experts. Their work showed true courage, particularly because they must have known the risks.
Punishing the leaders to quiet the herd is an old practice for authoritarian regimes, and this message was intended for news editors, television reporters, bloggers and others who would speak their minds to the public. With Mr. Putin back in the Kremlin, it is no longer safe to express an opinion on public affairs, even if that opinion was requested by the state itself.

HEADLINE: How Will Titans Merge? Carefully

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
When Jack Griffin, the former president of the magazine company Meredith, took the reins at Time Inc., he threw a holiday party for his staff on the 34th floor of the Time & Life Building. For many employees at the famously hierarchal company, their first visit to the rambling executive suites that inspired the sets of ''Mad Men'' became known as ''The Miracle on 34th.''
Mr. Griffin lasted just six months at Time before he was asked to leave by Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of its parent company, Time Warner publicly rebuked Mr. Griffin, saying that his ''leadership style and approach did not mesh with Time Inc. and Time Warner.''
As bankers and media executives work out the details of creating a new publicly traded company to house the magazine titles of the Meredith Corporation and the lifestyle titles of Time Inc., employees at both companies have been wondering how executives will take on the harder task of merging two very different corporate cultures. 
Meredith's headquarters in Des Moines have an open floor plan; the executives have their offices on the first floor and favor early-morning meetings. A recent lunch at one of Meredith's magazines featured kale salad and rosemary-infused cucumber lemonade. Time Inc. executives tend toward lunches at Michael's, where the dry-aged steak is a highlight, and after-work cocktails at the Lamb's Club.
And then there are the postrecessionary approaches to travel: Meredith's chief executive turned its corporate jets into shuttles with open seating, while Time Inc. still allows staff members to expense hotel rooms at the Four Seasons.
''It's like the Yankees' farm team taking over the Yankees,'' according to a current Time Inc. executive who, like many who talked about the merger, declined to be identified while criticizing bosses or potential bosses.
The merger news appears to be more troubling to employees at the long revered Time Inc., whose lucrative titles like People and InStyle have been essentially sold off by Time Warner and are likely to be overseen by Meredith's chief executive, Stephen M. Lacy. Time Inc. employees have made cracks about Des Moines and shared more sobering fears about the merger.
And unanswered questions swirl around the offices: Will Time Inc.'s Cooking Light and its fierce rival at Meredith, Eating Well, be expected to share intelligence? Can celebrity titles like People and InStyle flourish sharing a publisher with Wood magazine? And, most important of all, how many former Time Inc. executives might be moved to Iowa?
Press officers for both companies declined to comment about any specific negotiations. But an earlier effort to blend Meredith's folksy culture with the titans of Time failed quickly.
In August 2010, Mr. Griffin became the first chief executive to join Time Inc. from outside the company. His efforts to restructure some of the company's entrenched hierarchy and infuse his management experiences from Meredith were largely rebuffed. While he garnered praise for the holiday party, staff members bristled when Mr. Griffin, a marathon runner, introduced 7:30 a.m. breakfast meetings -- similar to the daily meetings he attended at Meredith, but a shock to the culture at Time Inc., where late nights on deadline are typical.
But this time, the companies are blending the titles that magazine industry executives say are more compatible. Time Inc. is holding onto the older titles that gave the company its gravitas, like Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated. The new company will include titles it created or purchased in recent decades, like the cash cows People and InStyle and smaller titles like Southern Living and This Old House.
Both companies also have major work forces beyond their home cities. Only 3,000 of Time Inc.'s nearly 8,000 employees are based in New York City, with offices in London and Birmingham, Ala. Meredith has its 1,000 magazine employees split evenly between its Midtown offices on Third Avenue and its headquarters in Des Moines.
''If you take Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated from the mix, you have much greater similarity to the titles that are left than differences,'' said Peter Kreisky, who worked as a senior adviser to Mr. Griffin at Time Inc. and who also has advised Meredith in the past.
In recent years, Meredith has actually fared worse than Time Inc. in terms of advertising pages for its monthly titles. Craig Huber, an independent research analyst with Huber Research Partners, noted that Meredith performed better during the recession, then dropped off relative to its competition as the economy improved. But he added that Meredith had continued to expand its magazine business while Time Warner shifted its focus elsewhere.
''Meredith has been willing to invest in small acquisitions that Time Warner has been trying to get out of,'' he said. ''Time Warner is focused on the rest of their business, all of their entertainment business, whereas Meredith only has magazines and TV stations.''
Meredith has also focused on bringing in new sources of revenue from events and custom publishing around its magazine titles, according to Reed Phillips, a managing partner for DeSilva & Phillips, a media banking firm. He said that Mr. Bewkes believed that ''under Meredith's management, with their ability to monetize marketing services for the Time Inc. magazines,'' the magazines would be ''better off and more profitable.''
Mr. Kreisky said that when he was hired by Meredith a decade ago to reinvent its corporate strategy, the magazine company was trying to expand beyond the category of shelter magazines. He pointed to its acquisitions of Gruner & Jahr's magazines, like Family Circle, and to how its existing titles expanded their platforms, as Better Homes and Gardens did in its licensing deal with Wal-Mart Stores and its television specials. Mr. Kreisky noted that Time Inc. had not leveraged its highly regarded brands as profitably over the years, suggesting that they could have developed a television network affiliated with People.
''Meredith is a very businesslike company,'' Mr. Kreisky said. ''They're very practical, pragmatic. They don't sacrifice editorial integrity. But they take a balanced approach to the development of their brands, whereas Time Inc. had an obsessive need for editorial control for everything around their brands. As a result, they've lost huge opportunities to develop their brands in other platforms.''
While Time Inc. executives privately characterized Meredith executives in the last week as being cheap on everything from compensation to their magazines' spending on paper stock, former Meredith executives say the company merely spends wisely.
While public filings do not reveal the salary of Time Inc.'s chief executive, Laura Lang, Mr. Lacy makes an annual base salary of $950,000 as Meredith's chief and has total compensation of $5.8 million including stock awards. Mr. Griffin said that when he worked at Meredith, the company focused aggressively on spending judiciously and weathering the recession.
''There's a difference between spending and investing, and Meredith has aggressively invested,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''There really is a sense we're all in this together.''
Time Inc., which its former executive Ed McCarrick described as ''the Harvard of the publishing business,'' has followed a very different trajectory. Nancy Williamson, who worked for the company from 1959 to 1998 at Sports Illustrated, Time and People, described how the company evolved from a news organization investing in serious journalism to a much fatter company.
''Greed came to the company in the '90s,'' she said. ''It was just a huge company: huge bonuses, huge salaries, stock shares for the big guy, not the little guy.''
Jim Kelly, a former Time Inc. executive, stressed that the company had tried to address its costs for years and added that ''Time has had more restructurings than Angelina Jolie has tattoos.''
Titles like InStyle may be able to thrive after the transition in ways it has not previously, as part of a company that has sometimes turned up its nose at celebrity journalism. Lynette Harrison Brubaker, who for eight years was InStyle's publisher, noted how much attention the magazine paid to its readers, which complements the extensive consumer data Meredith tracks and studies about its customers.
''The focus for everything that Time Inc. did was how was the reader going to react,'' Ms. Harrison Brubaker said. ''It was a laser focus.'' She added that ''From that standpoint, I could see InStyle and frankly all of those titles thriving with Meredith.''
There still will be plenty of growing pains. One former Time Inc. editor said Meredith executives should prepare to be surprised when they discover how much magazines like InStyle spend on celebrity fashion shoots.
''They're going to have sticker shock,'' the former editor said, chuckling. ''Every time they blink, it's another 20 grand.''

HEADLINE: Disquiet Over Italy, and Wall St. Dives

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market posted its biggest drop in more than three months on Monday after political turmoil in the Italian elections increased investor worries that Europe's debt problems could once again destabilize the global economy.
The sell-off accelerated late in the trading session after the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell below the 1,500 level, which has acted as a significant support point. Monday was the S.& P. 500's first close under 1,500 since Feb. 4.
This was the biggest percentage drop for the S.& P. 500 since Nov. 7 and was its lowest close since Jan. 18. 
The CBOE Volatility Index, known as the VIX, a significant measure of investor fear, surged 34 percent, its biggest jump since Aug. 18, 2011.
Italy's center-left coalition held a slim lead over former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's center-right bloc in the election for the Lower House, according to projections on three television networks. But any government must also command a majority in the Senate, a race that is decided by region.
If gridlock developed in the Italian Parliament, it could lead to new elections and cast into doubt Italy's ability to pay down its debt through its economic austerity program.
''Europe hasn't gone away as an issue; it is going to hang around, and it is rearing its ugly head today,'' said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.
''If someone gets elected who is simply not going to play by the rules, what are they going to do?'' Mr. Massocca said. ''It puts them in a real quandary here because their financial support, their monetary support is all stipulated by the fact that these austerity programs are going to be in place.''
After a strong start to the year, stocks have retreated recently. The S.& P. 500's slight fall last week was its first weekly drop after a seven-week string of gains.
In Monday's volatile session, banks and other financial stocks were among the worst performers because of worries about the sector's exposure to Italy's enormous debt. The KBW Bank Index fell 2.7 percent.
The VIX ended at 18.99, up 34.02 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 216.40 points, or 1.55 percent, to close at 13,784.17. The S.& P. 500 lost 27.75 points, or 1.83 percent, closing at 1,487.85. The Nasdaq composite index fell 45.57 points, or 1.44 percent, to 3,116.25.
Political uncertainty in Washington also weighed on Wall Street's mind. The stock market will be tested with the looming debate over the so-called sequester -- the government budget cuts that will take effect starting on Friday if lawmakers fail to reach an agreement over spending and taxes.
''Sitting out there is the 1,000-pound gorilla -- the sequester issue -- and certainly nothing is happening there,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of the Solaris Group.
Although the overall market lost ground on Monday, there were a few bright spots.
Barnes & Noble shares shot up 11.5 percent to $15.06 after the bookseller's chairman offered to buy its declining retail business.
Amgen shares climbed 3.1 percent to $89.55, after a rival, Affymax, issued a voluntary recall of its only drug, an anemia treatment that competed with Amgen's top-selling drug, Epogen. Affymax shares lost 85.4 percent and closed at $2.42.
But Lowe's, the home improvement retailer, lost 4.8 percent to $35.86 after it posted fourth-quarter earnings.
With 83 percent of the S.& P. 500 companies having reported results so far, 69 percent beat profit expectations, compared with a 62 percent average since 1994 and 65 percent over the last four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Fourth-quarter earnings for S.& P. 500 companies are estimated to have risen 6 percent, according to the data, above a 1.9 percent forecast at the start of the earnings season.
As stock prices dropped, investors shifted their money to the perceived safety of government bonds, and interest rates declined. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 28/32, to 101 7/32, while its yield fell to 1.87 percent, from 1.96 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Now the Desert Is Just a Desert

BYLINE: By RUBÉN MARTÍNEZ. 
Rubén Martínez, a professor of literature and writing at Loyola Marymount University, is the author of ''Desert America: Boom and Bust in the New Old West.''

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
TWELVE years ago I was broke, broken and on drugs in Mexico City, one of the most densely populated places on earth, and I dragged myself to the Mojave in California, one of the loneliest. I was following a deep tradition of healing journeys to the desert. The consumptives of the 19th century came to soothe their lungs in the dry, clean air; the Christian mystics of the fourth century retreated far from the Nile River Valley into their desert cells, seeking spiritual transformation. In recent years, the desert West has seized the imagination of a new generation of Americans from both coasts with the means to buy a vacation house in Sedona, Ariz., Joshua Tree, Calif., or Marfa, Tex.
At the same time, the desert has received new denizens from other social stations -- working-class refugees from gentrified cities, immigrants from Asia and Latin America. I was among the cohort who went because it was cheap. I started to put my life back together, aided by the relative quiet that characterizes a landscape that is simultaneously considered so utterly alien and so iconically American. But I eventually realized that the place I'd come to to purify body and spirit was anything but pure. Nearly everywhere I encountered precisely what I'd been running away from: poverty, racial tensions, drugs, addiction, smuggling-related violence. 
After a few years, because of my family and career, I had to leave the desert and move to Los Angeles. Then, last summer, more than a decade after I left Mexico City, my nephew Noah made a healing journey whose itinerary was the opposite of mine. He abandoned my wife's and his hometown, Albuquerque, to take refuge with us, fleeing the desert that I fled to.
He is a smart, earnest kid who is every inch his 21 years, with progressively large black ''gauges'' expanding the already gaping holes in his earlobes and a prominent piercing across the bridge of his nose. He'd gotten himself into trouble in Albuquerque. Noah and his mother, my sister-in-law, struggled for years in the desert of drugs, and he knew he had to leave.
Noah is a Westerner, even if our popular notions of the region haven't caught up to the way it's lived today. His parents are Mexican-American and African-American. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood devastated by addiction and incarceration. For his generation, the desert landscape that has served as symbolic touchstone for American natural grandeur -- prime real estate for those seeking detachment and spiritual renewal -- is increasingly phantasmagorical.
Migrants from Mexico and Central America are fed methamphetamine by the coyotes who are rushing them along the trails. Drug smugglers, crossing the desert en route to the rest of the country, drop off samples along the way, like pharmaceutical company reps trying to open up new markets. Just south of the border, in Mexico's ''gran desierto,'' the drug war rages, indifferent to the cowboy antics of ''America's Toughest Sheriff'' Joe Arpaio. The violence of turf battles and hideous mutilations correlates with spiking rates of abuse and overdose on this side of the line, on Native American reservations and in the shadow of the tourist destinations.
Adding to the strain is the fact that the desert West has endured a heavy burden in the Great Recession. Its foreclosure rates are among the highest in the nation. Two states -- Nevada and California -- still have unemployment rates hovering around 10 percent. Call it desert capitalism. Or the desert of capitalism.
Yet very little of Noah's West is visible to the rest of the country. The region's tourist imagery (aided by the artistic brilliance of the likes of Georgia O'Keeffe and Ansel Adams) has proved extraordinarily resilient in spite of what lurks just beyond the edges of the frame. Take, for example, the Santuario de Chimayo, a Catholic shrine that is one of northern New Mexico's most popular destinations. Entrenched poverty and heroin addiction exist within yards of the old church and its pit of holy dirt, said to hold miraculous healing powers. The tourist is shielded from that sight by the living diorama of the Old West.
This is a shame, because the American desert stands for the extremes we endure as a country. It is a place of radical growth at opposite ends of the economy, of increasing diversity and the nativist reaction against it. It highlights the utter failure of the ''war on drugs'' to stem the tide of smuggling and abuse. The Old West brought us Arizona's draconian immigration law; the New West helped elect and re-elect Barack Obama, with Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado swinging into the blue column. And, of course, as troubled as the region is, it's still vast enough to harbor the kind of natural beauty that drew me and countless others to it. The beauty is still there, alongside the darkness.
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, my newly clean nephew and I have taken to watching episodes of the television series ''Breaking Bad.'' We imagine ourselves versions of the show's protagonists: Walt, the chemistry teacher who stumbles into manufacturing meth while fighting cancer, and his protégé, Jesse, who gets by the way many young Westerners do -- scheming and scamming in a world where drugs are the central fact of life.
As we watch ourselves on-screen, we share our war stories, reliving the highs and the crashes. We also recognize many of the locations in Albuquerque, where the series is set and filmed. Hey, that's the gas station by Grandma's, Noah will say, or I'll spot an old restaurant whose green chile I miss. Sometimes, we catch sight of the rusty-hued Sandia Mountains in the distance -- the land I desired for its purity and Noah fled for its fallenness.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding On Their Own

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS
''Cities change from the bottom up, block by block,'' said Roberta Gratz, as we drove down Magazine Street, on our way to the Lower Ninth Ward here.
The author of ''The Battle for Gotham: New York in the Shadow of Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs,'' Gratz, like her friend and mentor Jacobs, is a student of what she calls ''urban regeneration.'' Since 2007, she has owned a home in New Orleans, and she was giving me what amounted to a tutorial on her next book subject: the rebuilding of the city post-Katrina.
''Look at this,'' she said, gesturing to storefronts. ''This is one of the longest shopping streets in the country. There are residential and commercial buildings, and local stores and chain stores. Very little was done for streets like this because the big money went to the tourism districts,'' she said. ''This grew back organically.'' Which, she believes, is the way it always happens. 
I was already coming around to that point of view. Some months earlier, when I had gone to the Rockaways, a stretch of New York coastal towns that had been pummeled by Hurricane Sandy, I had been struck by the lack of government response. Personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency set up offices, where they sipped coffee while waiting for Sandy victims to drop by. The city's sanitation department did heroic work, but other city agencies were largely invisible. (City officials later complained that they had done much more than I had acknowledged.)
Mostly, people helped other people. Churches donated space where victims could get staples. Nonprofit organizations were everywhere. Volunteers went from house to house, helping homeowners clear out debris.
I remember wondering at the time if it was always going to be like this. Despite the billions of dollars appropriated by Congress for Sandy recovery, would the rebuilding be as ad hoc, and as volunteer-dependent, as the initial emergency phase? If New Orleans is any indication, the answer is yes.
It is not as if New Orleans didn't have a grand plan. Its plan was put together by many of the city's machers, which concluded that the Lower Ninth, the poorest district in the city, which had been virtually wiped out by Katrina, should never be rebuilt. The plan called for turning a neighborhood that once had 14,000 residents into ''green space.'' The plan died a quick, deserved death.
And then?
''I remember going to visit a house in the Lower Ninth four months after Katrina with the owner, who was seeing it for the first time,'' said Gratz. ''It was as bad as anything you'd ever seen. He looked at it and said, 'It was in bad shape when I got it. I fixed it once, and I'll fix it again.' ''
Gratz told me this story in a sweet little restaurant called Café Dauphine in the Lower Ninth. It had been open for nine months. The woman who owned it lived across the street. Business was good, said the maître d'. Many of the houses on the surrounding street had been rebuilt, but there were still many that had not been touched since Katrina.
That is what you saw all over the Lower Ninth. People had trickled back -- not everyone because not everyone could afford to come back, but more than you'd think. Volunteer groups were helping to rebuild homes. Neighbors were helping neighbors. Most strikingly, Brad Pitt's rebuilding organization, Make It Right, has spent $24 million to build around 90 colorful, environmentally friendly homes in the Lower Ninth -- with plans to build about 60 more. There are many people in New Orleans, Gratz included, who believe Pitt is one of the true heroes of the rebuilding effort.
The city government no longer ignores the rebuilding in the Lower Ninth. It has small but meaningful programs to help smooth the path for people who want to move there. Then again, it has idiotically planted palm trees along one of the Lower Ninth's major streets, an inexplicable choice in a city known for its great live oaks.
Back in the Rockaways, the ''ground up'' rebuilding has already begun. Habitat for Humanity has arrived in force. In 2005, firefighters from New York went to New Orleans to help out after Katrina; now, firefighters from New Orleans are returning the favor. A group called Friends of Rockaway, using grant money from the Robin Hood Foundation, the primary philanthropy of the hedge fund industry, is employing local people to rebuild homes in their neighborhoods.
And government? New York City started a program called Rapid Repairs. People would order a boiler from the program and then wait for weeks for it to arrive. And half the time, it was the wrong boiler and had to be returned. It only reinforced what people in the Rockaways were coming to understand.
They're on their own.

HEADLINE: Skepticism Abounds as Six World Powers Resume Nuclear Talks With Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Talks between Iran and six world powers over its nuclear program resume here on Tuesday after a break of eight months, but there is a general atmosphere of gloom about their prospects for success, even if narrowly defined.
Since talks in Moscow last June, Iran has continued to increase its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 percent purity, has begun to install a new generation of centrifuges and has not yet completed an agreement on inspection of suspect military sites with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a deal originally advertised as all but done last May.
With presidential elections in Iran scheduled for June, senior Western diplomats involved with these talks expressed skepticism that Tehran's chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, would be willing to make compromises that could be portrayed as weakness at home.
Mr. Jalili is the personal representative of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, considered the dominant voice on the nuclear issue. Ayatollah Khamenei has recently expressed continued mistrust of the United States and its intentions, saying that he would not allow the kind of bilateral talks between Washington and Tehran that most analysts think would be crucial to any resolution. 
At the same time, Iran has taken some of its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium and converted it into reactor fuel, which cannot easily be turned back. The conversion means that Iran now has less of the uranium needed to make a bomb, reducing the sense of urgency among the six powers, and Israel, that its nuclear program needs to be slowed.
But the total Iranian stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium has nonetheless grown since November to 167 kilograms from 135 kilograms, according to the most recent I.A.E.A. report -- closer to, if still significantly below, the 240 kilograms or 250 kilograms many experts consider necessary, once enriched further, to produce a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies that its nuclear program has any military aim. The six world powers, the ''P5-plus-1'' group, which are the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- and Germany, want Iran to obey Security Council resolutions ordering it to suspend enrichment and open itself up fully to I.A.E.A. inspectors, to ensure that there is no effort to build a nuclear weapon.
To press Iran to comply, the Security Council, the United States and the European Union have created an increasingly painful set of economic sanctions on Iran, as part of a dual-track strategy -- negotiations and sanctions. Iran has insisted that as a precondition for serious negotiations, the world should lift all the sanctions and recognize Iran's ''right to enrich,'' which Iran asserts it has as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
The negotiations have been tedious, with Iran appearing to be playing for time, diplomats say. The six powers had asked for a resumption of talks as early as December, but Iran rejected dates and sites before finally suggesting Almaty.
The choice pleased Western diplomats for its symbolic value, since Kazakhstan, when it became independent of the Soviet Union, freely relinquished the nuclear weapons it had inherited from Moscow. American officials are holding up Kazakhstan, one of the world's largest producers of uranium and a maker of nuclear fuel, as an example to Iran of the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy and compliance with the I.A.E.A.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan appealed to Tehran in a New York Times Op-Ed article in March 2012 to abandon what he suggested was its pursuit of nuclear power status. ''Kazakhstan's experience shows that nations can reap huge benefits from turning their backs on nuclear weapons,'' he wrote.
While expectations are low, the six hope to leave here with some momentum and signs of Iranian willingness to engage in what all have agreed should be a reciprocal and step-by-step process of lifting sanctions in return for Iranian actions to comply.
''Iran needs to understand that there is an urgent need to make concrete and tangible progress'' in these talks, said Michael Mann, the spokesman for Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief and chairwoman of the P5-plus-1 group.
Mr. Mann said that the six powers had together ''prepared a good and updated offer for the talks which we believe is balanced and a fair basis for constructive talks'' and ''responsive to Iranian ideas.''
He and other Western diplomats refused to detail the offer before it was presented to the Iranians, but one senior diplomat called the offer ''substantial and serious'' and said recent news reports that suggested only some loosening in sanctions regarding gold sales ''do not reflect the full offer.'' The diplomat said the offer was ''not a big bang deal, more an agreement on a package of confidence-building measures.''
''Our main concern is the enrichment over 5 percent,'' which brings uranium closer to becoming bomb-grade, he said. ''Iran has a great deal to gain by engaging,'' the diplomat said. ''Once the international community has the assurances it needs, sanctions will start to be lifted.''
Another Western diplomat said that the offer had been updated to account for the new enrichment Iran has done in the eight months since Moscow. There, the offer was described as ''stop, shut, ship'' -- demanding that Iran stop enrichment of uranium to 20 percent purity; shut the Fordo underground enrichment facility, which is heavily protected deep inside a mountain; and ship abroad its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium to be turned into nuclear fuel.
The six said in Moscow that they would reciprocate initially by lifting some sanctions, including on parts for American civilian aircraft that Iran has long sought, and provide fuel for an Iranian nuclear reactor.
The sanctions have hurt the Iranian economy, especially the sanctions on oil exports, which make up a large part of the economy. French officials say that Iran's annual economic output has fallen by 8 percent because of the sanctions, inflation is very high -- officially at 27.4 percent in 2012 but unofficially much higher -- and the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, has dropped by about half over the past year.
Though Iranian officials insist that their economy is resilient, a senior American official said, ''They're beginning to feel the pressure of the sanctions.''
As for Iran's presidential elections in June, the American official acknowledged that the vote ''may constrain their political space,'' but said that the nuclear negotiations had their own pace, which the six would like to accelerate. ''We all understand that when it comes to the nuclear file, the key decisions are in the hands of the supreme leader,'' the official said, referring to Ayatollah Khamenei. ''And he is not going to change.''

HEADLINE: Reduced Spending Would Limit Park Services and Revenue, Interior Secretary Says

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mandatory federal spending cuts scheduled to begin Friday are already affecting operations at many of the nation's national parks and wildlife refuges, officials said Monday.
Contracts for plowing Tioga and Glacier Point roads in Yosemite National Park and Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park have been delayed, pushing back the opening of large parts of those popular parks. Hiring of seasonal workers -- including firefighters, law enforcement officers, search-and-rescue teams, and maintenance staff members -- has been frozen. Rangers are preparing to close or cut back hours at campgrounds, trails and visitor centers at parks from Cape Cod in Massachusetts to Denali in Alaska in anticipation of the across-the-board budget cuts.
Ken Salazar, the interior secretary, did not announce the closing of any parks, monuments or refuges, but said that hours for visitors centers, tours and interpretive programs, like those at the Gettysburg battlefield, would be curtailed. He also said that access to some backcountry trails and campgrounds could be limited if firefighting and rescue teams are cut back. 
''These are real impacts we're looking at,'' Mr. Salazar said in a call with reporters on Monday. ''The sequester was not supposed to happen and now we have to implement these reduced numbers in the remaining seven months of the year.''
Mr. Salazar's comments and his dire predictions for impacts on the millions of visitors to the nation's 398 national parks and 561 wildlife refuges are part of a concerted administration campaign to pressure Congress to cancel the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration and to accept President Obama's demand for balanced deficit reduction including some tax increases.
Mr. Salazar and Jonathan B. Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, used the call to highlight the economic impact of the 280 million annual visits to federally managed lands and the businesses that depend on them. They said the national parks generate $30 billion in economic activity and support 252,000 jobs and that some portion of those businesses and those jobs will suffer under the looming cuts.
Under the mandatory spending cuts, each park must absorb a 5 percent decrease in its annual budget. But since the sequester begins in the middle of the fiscal year, the immediate impact is in effect doubled.
Mr. Salazar has announced that he intends to leave office in March to return to his family in Colorado. President Obama has nominated Sally Jewell, currently the chief executive of the outdoor outfitter REI, to take over the department.
Mr. Salazar said that if the cuts take effect as scheduled, the agency will have to temporarily furlough thousands of employees, some for as long as 22 days. He said that federal personnel law requires 30 days' notice of involuntary furloughs, so none will take effect before April 1. He said that he and other officials are now planning such actions.
The Interior Department has already warned that the budget cuts will reduce federal revenue by slowing development of oil, gas and coal on federal lands and waters. Mr. Salazar, in a letter earlier this month to Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Maryland Democrat and chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said that the required cuts will have serious effects on the nation's prized natural, scientific and tribal resources.
Mr. Salazar said that the spending slowdown would delay review of an expected 550 drilling plans for the Gulf of Mexico and permits for seismic testing and air quality in Alaska. He also said that the agency would issue about 300 fewer drilling permits than anticipated this year for oil and gas wells in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
In addition, delays in coal leasing because of the sequester will cost the federal government $50 million to $60 million for each delayed lease sale, Mr. Salazar said.
Mr. Salazar also warned that federal mineral revenue sharing payments to state and local governments will decline by more than $200 million and that programs for Native American tribes would be trimmed by nearly $130 million.
Joan Anzelmo, the former superintendent of the Colorado National Monument and spokeswoman for the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, said that Mr. Salazar and Mr. Jarvis are highlighting the cuts that will be most immediately felt by the public to bring pressure on Congress to call off the sequester.
She said that the park service budget has been stagnant for four years while operating costs are rising. Something has to give, she said.
''Instead of being focused on getting their jobs done, park managers are all focused on how they're going to implement these cuts,'' she said in a telephone interview from her home in Wyoming. ''It's hurting people, it's hurting communities around the parks, and employees are at a point where they're hitting a wall. This is no way for our government to work.''

HEADLINE: Japan to Sell Part of Stake In Large Cigarette Maker

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The Japanese government is set to loosen its grip on Japan Tobacco, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, by selling a third of its stake in a sale that will net the country about $10 billion.
Under laws passed in 2011 after a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, proceeds of the sale of Japan Tobacco shares will go toward rebuilding the country's battered northeast coast. The reconstruction costs have threatened to weigh on Japan's public finances at a time when public debt is twice the size of its economy. 
The nation's Finance Ministry, which owns just over 50 percent of the former state monopoly, will sell 333 million of its shares in the cigarette manufacturer, according to a company statement issued on Monday.
The deal will be priced next month, from March 11 to 13, the statement said. Before the sale, Japan Tobacco will buy back up to 250 billion yen ($2.7 billion) of its shares.
Japan's stock market has rallied since mid-November, and Japan Tobacco's shares have tracked the market's ascent, climbing 20 percent in the last three months, making the move an opportune time for the Japanese government to sell.
Shares in Japan Tobacco closed 1.43 percent higher on Monday, at 2,901 yen ($31), before the planned sale was announced. At that price, the government's share sale would be valued at roughly 967 billion yen.
Japan has already been reducing its stake and involvement in the cigarette maker, which traces its origins to a Finance Ministry bureau set up in 1898 to create a national tobacco monopoly that lasted until 1985.
Even after the company went public, the Finance Ministry held two-thirds of its shares until 2004, when it reduced its stake to 50.1 percent, or roughly one billion shares. Other investors in Japan Tobacco include Mizuho Trust & Banking, Goldman Sachs and the Children's Investment Fund Management.
The nation's investment in Japan Tobacco has put the government in a controversial position.
The government has squeezed more funds from its smokers, raising the price of a pack of cigarettes about 40 percent in 2010, its single largest increase in tobacco taxes. Still, cigarettes remain relatively cheap in Japan, at about $4.30 a pack.
But antismoking advocates have blamed the Japanese government's continued ownership of Japan Tobacco -- whose brands include Camel, Winston and Mild Seven -- for the country's delay in passing laws to protect nonsmokers from cigarette smoke, for example, and more stringently regulating of tobacco-related marketing.
In a 2012 report, the Washington-based Global Business Group on Health said Japan's ownership of Japan Tobacco shares ''leads to a national conflict of interest, in which the government treats smoking as a behavioral issue rather than a health concern.''
Though smoking rates have started to decline in recent years, the Japanese remain heavy smokers, consuming about 1,841 cigarettes a person, according to data compiled last year by the World Lung Foundation and American Cancer Society. That compared with about 1,000 cigarettes a person in the United States.
To make up for declining cigarette consumption at home, Japan Tobacco has aggressively expanded overseas, acquiring Britain's Gallaher Group in 2007 for $15 billion, and adding the Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges brands to its portfolio. The company has also made a push into packaged foods and soft drinks, as well as pharmaceuticals.
The government's sale of Japan Tobacco shares is part of a wider effort to raise money to finance reconstruction from the country's natural and nuclear disasters in 2011. The government also plans to sell shares of Japan Post Holdings, which runs the country's postal system and also acts as its biggest bank.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Threat of Cuts Intensifies The Air Travel Headache

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I'M not foolhardy enough to venture guesses about what, if anything, may happen in Congress this week as the deadline for deep spending cuts looms on Friday. But there is the prospect of significant effects on air travel.
In recent days, Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary, has been warning that the budget cuts would create major disruptions in air travel. He said, for instance, that staff furloughs at the Federal Aviation Administration could force the closing of 100 air traffic control centers, and the elimination of overnight shifts at 60 others, in small and midsize markets. In an interview Monday on MSNBC, Mr. LaHood insisted that his comments were meant as ''warning flares'' about the effects of threatened cuts. 
No one, incidentally, is predicting immediate widespread disruptions if Congress allows those cuts to take effect on Friday.
''While the F.A.A. is using words like shuttered and furloughed, it is unlikely transportation will go into an immediate worst-case scenario,'' said Greeley Koch, the executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives.
''But with the economy showing some signs of life, the last thing you would want to do is stop or reverse the process by having the F.A.A. restrict air travel,'' he added.
Whatever the immediate impact, those warning flares from Mr. LaHood do illuminate a landscape where business travelers and company travel managers are already feeling uneasy, given the uncertainty about rising prices and continuing capacity cuts that have been reducing airline service in smaller markets.
''The most frustrated folks right now are business travelers, who expect a certain amount of predictability going through the system,'' said Geoff Freeman, the chief operating officer of the U.S. Travel Association. With the possibility of increased waiting times at airport security, where furloughs would also occur, business travelers and corporate managers might cut back on planned trips ''in a travel process that's already pushed to the brink.'' He added, ''Travel could very easily become the face of the sequester.''
One of the immediate effects of reduced operations at the F.A.A. would probably be felt in regional air service, or the vital connections between midsize and small airports and big city hubs.
The budget standoff is ''an irresponsible game of chicken, with no winners,'' said Roger Cohen, the president of the Regional Airline Association.
Cutbacks in smaller markets would create ''delays and missed connections at the major hubs, such as Chicago O'Hare, Houston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Minneapolis, New York's La Guardia and Newark, and Washington Reagan, each where regional airlines account for more than half the daily flights,'' he said.
Airlines would also probably further reduce flights in those feeder markets. Major furloughs in the ranks of air traffic controllers ''will undoubtedly have a negative effect on capacity,'' according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
''Airlines will have fewer flights, and fewer passengers will fly,'' the group said in a statement.
If travel cuts occur, airlines will do everything they can to protect operations at the big hubs where most of their revenue is generated, including for international flights.
Dan Elwell, the senior vice president for safety, security and operations at Airlines for America, the domestic airlines' trade association, said that it was too early to speculate on how airlines might adjust to possible cutbacks.
Will airlines begin to triage already reduced service in the regional markets to keep the hubs functioning efficiently?''We fully expect to get details,'' as the budget showdown approaches, Mr. Elwell said. ''We have a team that works full time at the national command center of the F.A.A., and they're in place for anything that could arise.''
For their part, travel managers who need to plan well ahead are deeply concerned, said Mr. Koch of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives.
''Dire warnings of 90-minute delays at major airports and limited or no services at regional airports are being evaluated by travel management executives around the world today,'' he said, noting that if cuts did occur, ''international travel headed to the United States will suffer, too.''
Mr. Freeman, at the U.S. Travel Association, predicted that there would be ''a lot of frustrated travelers'' if the cuts occurred. Frustration with airline service cutbacks, as well as airport security and customs hassles, ''is already the biggest issue we face as an industry when it comes to growth,'' he said. ''The fact is that air travel is already widely considered by many people to be a pain in the fill-in-the-blank.''
Even without the aggravating effects of budget cuts, the costs of air travel are mounting, especially as airlines struggle with fuel prices that are expected to rise to record average levels this year.
In a recent report, the Global Business Travel Association said buyers ''expect travel prices to increase substantially in 2013, from 4.6 percent for domestic economy airfare to 8.3 percent for international economy airfare.''
Those expectations are already starting to be realized. Late last week, the major airlines began a round of price increases for trips booked within seven days of departure -- the sort of fares ''that are typically flown by business travelers,'' said Rick Seaney, the chief executive of FareCompare.com.

HEADLINE: Elevating the Land of Nod

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Those flat-bed seats for international business-class fliers? Now that most airlines offer them, they are not so special anymore.
Instead, in the newest iteration of the battle for deep-pocketed fliers, the airlines are introducing an ever-growing assortment of in-flight amenities to go with those seats.
Delta Air Lines, in the latest move, plans to announce on Tuesday that a partnership with Westin Hotels and Resorts will give business-class passengers on international and transcontinental flights ''Westin Heavenly In-Flight Bedding,'' starting this summer.
That follows the introduction in the last two years of upgrades in business-class services by airlines like American Airlines, United Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa, Cathay Pacific and Qantas, featuring everything from improved mood lighting and in-flight entertainment to designer amenity kits and the option to pre-order meals by e-mail. 
Carriers are willing to invest in the services, said Henry Harteveldt, an analyst for Hudson Crossing, a travel industry consultancy, because ''profits from long-haul, international premium cabins can be five times greater, or more, than what is earned in economy, and several times greater than what is earned on domestic or regional flights.''
''Since the end of the last financial recession in 2010, we've seen the beginning of reinvestment by airlines in their products,'' he added. ''It reflects the normal cycle.''
Peter J. Bates, president of Strategic Vision, a marketing communications company in Tarrytown, N.Y., said that ''as airlines consolidate into smaller groups, they are continuously trying to find ways to gain market share and differentiate their product.'' He added: ''This goes in phases. Now that the airlines have gone through the flat-bed phase, they have to create more bells and whistles to differentiate themselves.''
Carriers no doubt also want to respond to what Egencia, the travel management arm of Expedia, identified in research last summer as companies' ''increasing willingness to bump their travelers'' to business or first class on ''flights lasting more than nine hours.'' Egencia said 45 percent of business travelers were permitted by their employers to travel in such seats ''on flights over nine hours, compared to just 6 percent of business travelers on flights lasting less than nine hours.''
Delta's Westin bedding is part of a new, broader strategy to cater to the need for a good night's sleep, company executives said. They pointed to customer research, which has shown that this is the top priority for all passengers, regardless of their class of service.
Tim Mapes, Delta's senior vice president for marketing, said, ''The airline that comes to represent a good night's sleep in the minds of customers will be the airline that attracts a disproportionately large share of customers.''
To that end, Delta worked with Westin to create a comforter as well as sleeping and lumbar pillows and pillow cases. The hotel chain introduced its ''Heavenly Bed'' program, featuring a pillowtop mattress and special sheets, pillows, down blankets and duvet, in 1999, and briefly collaborated five years ago with United Airlines to offer special bedding on transcontinental flights and Westin seating, lighting and scent in some airport lounges. Delta will begin offering the new bedding this summer in business-class cabins on all international flights, and on flights from Kennedy Airport to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, and from Atlanta to Honolulu.
In addition, Delta is training its pursers, who supervise cabin crews, to change in-flight procedures to provide a more restful environment by, for example, streamlining public announcements, closing overhead compartments gently and controlling lighting. Delta's in-flight entertainment system has a new ''white noise'' channel, and the carrier is creating an express meal menu, with lighter fare and one-step delivery, for transcontinental business-class passengers. The menu is already available on many international flights.
The introduction of the Westin bedding coincides with an agreement announced this month by Delta and Westin's parent, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, to offer reciprocal benefits to elite-level participants in both companies' loyalty programs. In addition, Delta has been working with prominent, often high-end, consumer brands. It uses Porsche cars to transfer top frequent fliers to connecting flights at its main hub in Atlanta. It sells Diageo premium liquor brands at its airport lounges, and this month it began distributing Tumi amenity kits, with Malin & Goetz luxury skin care products, to business-class passengers on international flights.
Mr. Mapes declined to say how much money Delta was putting into the new sleep strategy, describing it as a ''substantial investment, in the hundreds of millions of dollars,'' which would also cover the installation of flat-bed seats.
Peter Vlitas, senior vice president for airline sales and marketing for Protravel International, a travel agency in New York that books business and leisure travel, predicted that the strategy could help Delta win passengers on relatively short transcontinental flights and on trans-Atlantic flights from the East Coast of the United States. ''If an airline can maximize comfort and the passenger perceives this is the way to go to get the best sleep, it could have a significant impact,'' he said.
Greeley Koch, executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, said Delta's initiatives might appeal to companies concerned about their employees' productivity on the road. ''They're focusing on what kind of value they're getting for the airline ticket, and if the meeting is revenue-producing, the traveler is rested and as productive as possible for the business mission,'' he said.
But Michael Steiner, executive vice president of Ovation Corporate Travel, a travel agency in New York, said price, schedules and corporate travel policies were the most important factors in business travelers' choice of airlines, followed by loyalty program benefits and then in-flight amenities.
Similarly, Gene Kaskiw, an aviation lawyer from Newark who has flown in Cathay Pacific's updated business-class cabin, said an airline's seat and schedule were the most important factors when he chose a flight. ''Amenities like a duvet are important,'' he said, ''but they're not the primary drivers of my decision.''
Tim Winship, publisher of FrequentFlier.com, a Web site on travel loyalty programs, called the Delta initiatives ''better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.'' But they would not be ''a difference-maker,'' he said. ''If I'm looking to choose an airline for a long-haul flight, I'm not focused on bedding, I'm focused on the seat itself.''
In fact, he said the latest loyalty program collaboration by Delta and Starwood was more significant than Delta's sleep strategy because Delta and Starwood were the first travel companies to offer reciprocal benefits to each other's elite customers.

HEADLINE: Treasury Nominee Weathers a Wave of Questioning

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
As the Senate gears up to vote on the next Treasury secretary, President Obama's choice for the job, Jacob J. Lew, has been forced to navigate through something of a political minefield.
As White House chief of staff and a former budget director, Mr. Lew has sought to show he has enough Wall Street experience to handle turbulent financial markets, but not enough to prevent him from reining in the powerful banking industry.
Mr. Lew, who is expected to win an initial nod from the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday and sail on to approval in a full Senate vote, has battled a range of criticism, including questions about his lucrative tenure at Citigroup, a Cayman Islands investment and housing assistance he received as an administrator at New York University more than a decade ago.
To shore up his support, Mr. Lew has met privately in recent weeks with 41 senators and responded to 738 questions for the record. On Tuesday, he is scheduled to head to Capitol Hill for another meeting. 
Much of the vitriol surrounding Mr. Lew's nomination concerns the terms of his employment at Citigroup, which seemed to reward him for leaving the bank if he took a high-ranking position in government.
During Mr. Lew's confirmation hearing, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, peppered Mr. Lew with questions about the terms of that contract, specifically challenging whether the contract violated the president's efforts to ''close the revolving door.''
Under the terms of Mr. Lew's contract with Citi, he kept certain bonus compensation if he left for a ''high level position with the United States government or regulatory body,'' but not a competitor in the private sector, according to several people with direct knowledge of the contract.
Many of the most exacting questions have come from Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, related to a money-losing investment in a fund based in the Cayman Islands.
Mr. Lew had a $56,000 investment in the Citigroup fund, leading to questions from Republican senators about whether the investment had been put there to dodge taxes.
At one point during the hearings, Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, held up a huge picture of Ugland House, an office building in the Cayman Islands where thousands of companies, including Mr. Lew's fund, have registered. The display struck a particularly discordant note because Mr. Obama has used the Ugland House as a symbol for tax havens in his first campaign for president.
''Well there's a certain hypocrisy in what the president says about other taxpayers, and your appointment,'' Mr. Grassley said during the hearing.
Mr. Lew responded by saying that he did not get any tax advantages because of the investment's location and sold it for a loss.
Senator Grassley also pressed Mr. Lew for more details on hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans that New York University provided while he was an executive with the school.
''N.Y.U. provided the financing over a decade ago,'' Mr. Lew wrote in a response to Senator Grassley's follow-up questions, providing details on the dollar figures and construction of the financing. ''During the intervening time period, I repaid the university and privately refinanced the mortgage on my home multiple times. I am still living in the same home today.''
Senator Grassley was not satisfied with Mr. Lew's written responses, saying he still had concerns about the transparency of Mr. Lew's compensation. ''Mr. Lew has a lack of knowledge or a poor memory of some of the perks he received through his tenure at New York University and Citigroup,'' the senator said in a statement. ''Most people who receive a $1.4 million loan from their employer remember the terms.''
Privately, officials involved in the confirmation process called the spate of attacks on Mr. Lew politically motivated, arguing that the Cayman Islands criticisms are a direct reprisal for attacks leveled at Mitt Romney during the presidential campaign for his offshore bank accounts.
Much of the battle over Mr. Lew's income and former status on Wall Street is inconsistent, the aides contended, pointing out that Republicans broadly backed Henry M. Paulson Jr., who left his position as chief executive of Goldman Sachs to become Treasury secretary in 2006.
Despite the criticism, some Republican senators on the committee have signaled their support for Mr. Lew, including Rob Portman of Ohio. In a promising sign for Mr. Lew's prospects, Richard Shelby of Alabama, who sits on the appropriations committee as well as the banking committee, said he would back Mr. Lew.
Mr. Lew is a longtime Democratic budget expert, who has spent most of the last 30 years as a Congressional aide or in the White House working on issues like Social Security, taxes and fiscal policy. While still in grade school, Mr. Lew served as a foot soldier in Eugene McCarthy's first presidential campaign. He later served as an aide to Tip O'Neill, a longtime speaker of the House.
Mr. Lew quickly rose to more prominent positions, eventually serving as the powerful White House budget director, first for President Bill Clinton and later for President Obama.
Mr. Obama chose him in no small part for that expertise. The next Treasury secretary will need to deal with the so-called sequestration, a round of $85 billion in budget cuts to be made before the end of the fiscal year in September, as well as a fight over financing the government.
Mr. Lew began his relatively brief immersion on Wall Street when he joined Citigroup in 2006 as chief operating officer of the bank's global wealth management unit. But the role he took on in January 2008 as chief operating officer for the bank's alternative investment unit stirred the most congressional ire.
Containing some of the most volatile investments at the bank, the unit plowed money into hedge funds and private equity investments. Those investments helped to catalyze Citigroup's huge losses in the depths of the financial crisis, forcing the bank to take billions of dollars in taxpayer money.
In response to questions about the unit's investments, Mr. Lew told lawmakers that he was more of a logistics man, overseeing the budget operations, rather than hashing out investment decisions. Mr. Lew has struck this neutral tone before. In 2010 confirmation hearings for budget director, Mr. Lew described himself ''as a manager, not as an investment adviser.''
At one point, though, Senator Hatch questioned whether Mr. Lew saw e-mails about the sort of souring complex investments that brought Citigroup to near collapse. Also at issue for Senator Hatch was whether Mr. Lew knew that the unit had bet against some of the financial products it assembled. ''Did you not know about the marketing of the sales products in the unit you managed, in which case I wonder what you did do?'' Senator Hatch said.
Mr. Lew has maintained that he was not involved in those decisions. ''Yes, I was aware that there were funds that were in trouble,'' Mr. Lew testified, adding: ''I didn't have responsibility for the funds themselves, but I was aware that those difficulties were going on.''
The criticism of Mr. Lew reached a high pitch when Senator Grassley questioned whether Mr. Lew thought it was morally sound to take a $940,000 bonus in 2008, just a day before the bank took taxpayer money to help avert its demise. Mr. Lew said simply that he was ''compensated in a manner consistent with other people.''

HEADLINE: The States Get the Bad News

 BODY:
In Kentucky, home of the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, residents woke up on Monday to news articles like these: Widespread government spending cuts that begin on Friday will cost 21,484 jobs in the state. A construction project at Fort Knox will come to a halt. Three airports may endure partial shutdowns. Nearly $12 million in grants to public schools would be cut, putting at risk the jobs of 160 teachers and aides. More than 1,000 children would lose access to Head Start. 
The White House released warnings for every state on Sunday in the hope that angry voters would besiege Republican lawmakers like Mr. McConnell and the House speaker, John Boehner, to stop the $85 billion in cuts, known as a sequester. President Obama wants to replace the sequester with a mix of tax increases on the rich and less damaging spending reductions. Republicans say they won't consider any proposal that isn't all cuts, so the sequester is all but certain to begin this week.
The White House strategy on the sequester was built around a familiar miscalculation about Republicans. It assumed that, in the end, they would be reasonable and negotiate a realistic alternative to indiscriminate cuts. Because the reductions hurt defense programs long held sacrosanct by Republicans, the White House thought it had leverage that would reduce the damage to the domestic programs favored by Democrats.
It turns out, though, that the defense hawks in the party are outnumbered. More Republicans seem to care about reducing spending at all costs, and the prospect of damaging vital government programs does not seem to bother them. ''Fiscal questions trump defense in a way they never would have after 9/11,'' Representative Tom Cole, a Republican of Oklahoma, told The Times. ''But the war in Iraq is over. Troops are coming home from Afghanistan, and we want to secure the cuts.''
Cuts this draconian have no place in a tottering economy. But, realistically, the only way to break this standoff is for the cuts to exact their toll on daily life, causing Republicans to face pressure from the public to negotiate an alternative plan with higher revenues in March as part of talks to finance the government for the final six months of the fiscal year.
The details the White House released over the weekend are eye-opening. In Ohio, Mr. Boehner's home state, the cuts could cost 30,000 jobs. An 8 percent cut in federal research grants ''would probably bring us to our knees,'' said Dr. Thomas Boat, dean of the University of Cincinnati's College of Medicine, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer.
New York would lose $42.7 million in education aid, according to the White House, putting at risk nearly 600 jobs for teachers and their aides. About 12,000 civilian defense workers would be furloughed, and there would be big cuts to grants for law enforcement, job training, child care, public health and environmental protection.
The White House should have released these kinds of details months ago, when there was more time to make a strong case to the public against these cuts. Instead, administration officials failed to discuss the consequences, fearing political blame while confidently predicting the Republicans would cave. The result of that miscalculation -- and of the Republican disdain for the health of the economy and those who depend on government services -- will become clearer in just a few days.

HEADLINE: We Paid for the Research, So Let's See It

 BODY:
The Obama administration is right to direct federal agencies to make public, without charge, all scientific papers reporting on research financed by the government. In a memorandum issued on Friday, John Holdren, the president's science adviser, directed federal agencies with more than $100 million in annual research and development expenditures to develop plans for making the published results of almost all the research freely available to everyone within one year of publication. 
The agencies must submit plans to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy within the next six months that will apply to both peer-reviewed scientific papers and digital manuscripts and supporting data.
Under current procedures, much of the federally financed research is published in scientific and medical journals that can cost thousands of dollars a year for a subscription and $30 or more for an individual copy. That is simply too much for many people and small businesses to afford.
The principle that must be upheld, as Mr. Holdren described it, is that Americans ''deserve easy access to the results of research their tax dollars have paid for.'' He added that ''the logic behind enhanced public access is plain'' because broad dissemination of scientific findings will increase innovation and promote economic growth.
The National Institutes of Health, the government's chief supporter of medical research, already makes papers available in a common database within a year of publication. Other agencies should create similar centralized repositories for papers.
Both the new directive and the N.I.H. policy allow delays of a year before making papers freely available. That may be too long. Federal agencies should keep any delays as short as possible.

HEADLINE: A Vote on Sick Leave

 BODY:
For many months now, advocates of paid sick leave on the New York City Council have seen their efforts put on hold by Speaker Christine Quinn. Now, one of Ms. Quinn's prominent supporters in the upcoming mayor's race, Gloria Steinem, has said she would withdraw her backing if the speaker continues to block a vote on sick leave. ''Making life fairer for all women seems more important than breaking a barrier for one woman,'' Ms. Steinem said. 
The business community and Mayor Michael Bloomberg oppose such legislation, but that is no excuse for not allowing a vote on the bill. A majority of the Council supports the measure offered by Council Member Gale Brewer, and it would be approved if it reached the floor. The bill would require employers with five or more employees to grant up to five paid sick days a year. Businesses with fewer than five employees would not pay for sick days but could not fire workers for taking those days off.
The bill gives businesses the flexibility to grant any type of paid leave -- vacation, personal leave days -- to count as sick days. It would cover domestic workers, but not most student trainees or union workers with comparable benefits. There would be no cashing out of stored sick days when an employee leaves, and small businesses with fewer than 20 employees would have a grace period of one year before the law would take effect.
Ms. Quinn continues to stall on the issue, saying that she is willing to keep discussing the idea. But she insists that a change would be harmful to businesses in the current economy, even though there is little evidence that sick-leave requirements have hurt job markets. The bill is scheduled for a hearing next month. If it passes muster at the Civil Service and Labor Committee as expected, Ms. Quinn should allow a vote.

HEADLINE: Low Pay at Weight Watchers Stirs Protest as Stars Rake It In

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Tammy Williams became a Weight Watchers leader in Texas five years ago after losing 97 pounds in the program. The supplies that she handles fill a bedroom in her home, and she holds four meetings a week advising more than a hundred customers about the diet regimen.
The problem, Ms. Williams said, is that she works so many hours and is paid so little. ''They know my love for the program, but I can't say we're treated right,'' she said. ''We are professionals, we have to dress nice, but we are paid less than kids who work at McDonald's.''
As the highly competitive weight-loss industry continues to suffer from the sluggish economy -- Weight Watchers reported a 15.6 percent decline in earnings last year -- hundreds of its rank-and-file workers are waging an open rebellion that management is scrambling to address.
This frustration reflects a growing discontent among low-wage workers, as seen in the recent protests at dozens of Walmarts, at high-end retailers in Chicago and at fast-food restaurants in New York. Low-wage workers have become more assertive out of dismay that while corporate profits have rebounded to record levels since the recession, wages have floundered. 
Many also feel trapped as the gap between haves and have-nots has widened. Some employees at Weight Watchers expressed irritation at being paid the minimum wage while the company lavishes millions of dollars on celebrities like Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Hudson to advertise its weight-loss program.
Executives at Weight Watchers say they are paying attention to their employees' concerns, and have hinted they will increase compensation.
The company's chief executive, David Kirchhoff, wrote to employees earlier this month, saying, ''One of our top priorities is to improve your working life at Weight Watchers, and in particular, the way we reward you for the incredible work you do.''
Employees -- many of them leaders like Ms. Williams who run meetings -- have inundated an internal company Web site with complaints about poor wages and being pressured to work many hours unpaid.
Some leaders say that the $18 base rate for running meetings has not increased in more than a decade, and many complain that they receive no mileage reimbursement for the first 40 miles driven each day. Some also assert that a major reason Weight Watchers keeps its pay so paltry is that the overwhelming majority of its employees are women.
''We are not working for a charity or a nonprofit corp,'' one Weight Watchers leader posted on the Web site. ''This is a multimillion-dollar company with enough cash to advertise relentlessly on TV, and pay celebrities tons of money to lose weight.''
The restlessness over low pay extends across the weight-loss industry to Weight Watchers' rivals, including Jenny Craig and Nutrisystem. A pending lawsuit asserts that Jenny Craig's employees in New York State typically work through their lunch hour, but are not paid for that time -- a claim the company denies. That comes after Weight Watchers reached a $6.2 million settlement two years ago to end a class-action lawsuit in California in which employees complained about minimum wage violations, off-the-clock work and receiving paychecks that did not explain how wages were calculated.
''People feel they did everything right. They're working hard, they have higher levels of education than ever before, and they find the job market is offering them a wage that they can't live on,'' said Janice R. Fine, a professor of employment relations at Rutgers University.
For Weight Watchers, one of the world's oldest and largest dieting companies, keeping its leaders happy is crucial to the company's future, because it relies on them to recruit and retain members through the nearly 50,000 face-to-face meetings the company runs each week worldwide.
The leaders, often highly educated professionals who were hired after losing dozens of pounds in the program, sometimes sound like religious disciples, so eager are they to help others lose weight.
But their disillusionment over compensation is not unique to their industry. Sharon H. Mastracci, an expert on women's employment at the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of ''Breaking Out of the Pink-Collar Ghetto,'' said these complaints parallel those in other fields with mostly female workers, like child care and social work.
''It's a female-dominated job, it's in the service industry, and it's caring work,'' Professor Mastracci said of Weight Watchers. ''Caring work is undervalued, and they're taking for granted that you care so much you're going to be there no matter what.''
The appeals for higher pay come at a difficult time for Weight Watchers; its earnings slid last year to $257.4 million on slightly higher revenue of $1.83 billion. It forecasts lower earnings this year because of problems recruiting new members to its meetings. Members pay $42.95 a month on average to belong to the program.
Mr. Kirchhoff, who made $2.96 million in 2011 according to Forbes magazine, wrote that revamping the compensation system was complicated and would ''require careful consideration.'' In a second note, last Wednesday, corporate leaders said they would begin online discussions with 80 employees about the ''changes and enhancements'' they are seeking.
Stacie Sherer, the company's communications director, said a large majority of employees earned ''significantly more than minimum wage'' for their meetings through sales commissions. She dismissed the notion that pay levels were low because most employees were female.
Kelley Brickfield, a leader in Tampa, also defended the company, saying she liked being able to increase her pay through sales commissions. She praised it for having a better benefits package than many other companies.
But Ms. Williams complained that she was paid just $7,600 last year for leading four meetings a week in Wichita Falls, Tex. She receives extra pay as a local coordinator and commissions for selling company products like recipe books, scales and smoothie mixes.
While the company pays for two and a half hours of work to run a meeting, Ms. Williams, who is planning to quit, said it could take three hours or more to set up chairs, weigh in members, give talks, sell products and clean up. (For meetings that attract 50 or 60 members, several leaders said that they received around $60 instead of the $18 base rate, and that receptionists for meetings received a base rate of $12 before commissions.)
Like many leaders, Ms. Williams said she worked many hours unpaid -- ordering products, delivering them to meetings, counting and banking the money collected, and preparing her remarks for meetings.
''We're bankers, we're storehouses -- it's unduly burdensome,'' said Patricia Sorlien, a Weight Watchers leader outside Seattle. ''All of us are highly skilled or we wouldn't be leaders, yet for the most part we are paid the minimum wage.''
Teri Weatherby began leading meetings in Hartford, Conn., after retiring from her job as an insurance company's senior vice president. ''Other than the financial problems, it's probably the most rewarding thing I've ever done,'' she said. ''That's what they prey upon. It's like an abusive relationship. You know you should leave, but you stay because you love it.''

HEADLINE: Yahoo Orders Home Workers Back to the Office

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER and CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Since Marissa Mayer became chief executive of Yahoo, she has been working hard to get the Internet pioneer off its deathbed and make it an innovator once again.
She started with free food and new smartphones for every employee, borrowing from the playbook of Google, her employer until last year. Now, though, Yahoo has made a surprise move: abolishing its work-at-home policy and ordering everyone to work in the office.
A memo explaining the policy change, from the company's human resources department, says face-to-face interaction among employees fosters a more collaborative culture -- a hallmark of Google's approach to its business.
In trying to get back on track, Yahoo is taking on one of the country's biggest workplace issues: whether the ability to work from home, and other flexible arrangements, leads to greater productivity or inhibits innovation and collaboration. Across the country, companies like Aetna, Booz Allen Hamilton and Zappos.com are confronting these trade-offs as they compete to attract and retain the best employees. 
Bank of America, for example, which had a popular program for working remotely, decided late last year to require employees in certain roles to come back to the office.
Employees, especially younger ones, expect to be able to work remotely, analysts say. And over all the trend is toward greater workplace flexibility.
Still, said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger Gray & Christmas, an outplacement and executive coaching firm, ''A lot of companies are afraid to let their workers work from home some of the time or all of the time because they're afraid they'll lose control.''
Studies show that people who work at home are significantly more productive but less innovative, said John Sullivan, a professor of management at San Francisco State University who runs a human resource advisory firm.
''If you want innovation, then you need interaction,'' he said. ''If you want productivity, then you want people working from home.''
Reflecting these tensions, Yahoo's policy change has unleashed a storm of criticism from advocates for workplace flexibility who say it is a retrograde approach, particularly for those who care for young children or aging parents outside of work. Their dismay is heightened by the fact that they hoped Ms. Mayer, who became chief executive at 37 while pregnant with her first child, would make the business world more hospitable for working parents.
''The irony is that she has broken the glass ceiling, but seems unwilling for other women to lead a balanced life in which they care for their families and still concentrate on developing their skills and career,'' said Ruth Rosen, a professor emerita of women's history at the University of California.
But not only women take advantage of workplace flexibility policies. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly as many men telecommute.
The bureau says 24 percent of employed Americans report working from home at least some hours each week. And 63 percent of employers said last year that they allowed employees to work remotely, up from 34 percent in 2005, according to a study by the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit group studying the changing work force.
During the recession, the institute expected employers to demand more face time, but instead found that 12 percent increased workplace flexibility, said Ellen Galinsky, its president and co-founder. She attributed this to companies' desire to reduce real estate costs, carbon footprints and commuting times.
Technologies developed in Silicon Valley, from video chat to instant messaging, have made it possible for employees across America to work remotely. Yet like Yahoo, many tech companies believe that working in the same physical space drives innovation.
A Yahoo spokeswoman, Sara Gorman, declined to comment, saying only that the company did not publicly discuss internal matters.
The company's memo, written by Jackie Reses, director of human resources at Yahoo, and published on All Things D, a blog on digital issues, said: ''Some of the best decisions and insights come from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people and impromptu team meetings. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home.''
In part, the memo looks like an effort to bring a Google spirit to Yahoo, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners who covers both companies.
''Marissa's trying to increase the energy and output and change the culture of the company,'' he said. ''She brings all the Google lessons to the table, and Google is very focused on having your life revolve around their campus so you can spend a significantly larger chunk of time at work.''
Still, Google, as well as Facebook, does allow people to work remotely on a case-by-case basis. But both companies also strongly stress in-person collaboration.
Standard Silicon Valley perks like cafeterias with free food, shuttle buses, gyms, ice cream parlors and dry cleaners not only make employees' lives easier, but keep them on campus during the day and promote contact with other employees. Nearly all tech companies have desks packed tightly together without walls and communal work areas with sofas and beanbags.
Zappos, the e-commerce company owned by Amazon.com, previously allowed some customer service agents to work from home, but now has a rule against working remotely. The company locks all office doors except one so employees are forced to run into more people on the way out, and budgets fewer than 100 square feet per employee, versus the standard 120 square feet or more.
''It's to maximize those serendipitous encounters,'' said Zach Ware, who oversees campus development at the company. ''The success of our company is built on our culture, and our perspective is you can't really do that on e-mail.''
Some companies outside the tech industry are also re-evaluating flexible work arrangements. In addition to Bank of America, certain industries that deal with sensitive client information, like health care and finance, have more restrictions on working remotely.
Yet more companies embrace flexibility. At Aetna, 47 percent of workers telecommute, up from 9 percent in 2005. The company provides secure Internet and phone connections, locked file cabinets and shredders. During that period, the policy has saved the company $78 million in real estate costs, said Susan Millerick, an Aetna spokeswoman.
At Booz Allen, employees can work at home or sign up to work at a desk in another branch, called ''hoteling.'' The policy has been vital to employee retention, said Christopher Carlson, a senior associate in human resources at Booz Allen. He works from his home in Florida, where he moved from the Washington, D.C., region to care for his aging parents.
''It allows me to integrate my work and life and be successful at both,'' Mr. Carlson said. ''And I spend less money on gas.''

HEADLINE: Secrets to Success in Online College Learning

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A few counterpoints must be made in response to your Feb. 19 editorial ''The Trouble With Online College.''
First, not all online learning can be characterized as failing its students. The online learning company Udacity, for instance, is running a pilot program for remedial students at San Jose State University, and so far only 20 percent of them have dropped the class, much below the rate of 50 percent for similar online offerings. 
This can be attributed to a superior pedagogy. Udacity provides top-notch professors, active tutorials that engage the student and live helplines for students who get stuck. When more digital learning providers adopt this quality of instruction, outcomes will improve as well.
Your editorial also doesn't mention that, in contrast, more than 40 percent of students who enroll in a four-year college do not graduate within six years. The average student debt burden is around $25,000, and the unemployment/underemployment rate for 2011 graduates was more than 50 percent.
To give the impression that brick-and-mortar courses offer an unquestionably superior product is disingenuous. As the public becomes more aware of the underperformance of higher education (and so holds it more accountable for its output), it becomes more likely that online alternatives will supplant or replace much of what goes on at traditional colleges and universities.
WILLIAM J. BENNETT DAVID WILEZOL Washington, Feb. 21, 2013
Mr. Bennett, a member of Udacity's advisory board, was education secretary in the Reagan administration. The writers are the authors of the forthcoming book ''Is College Worth It?''
To the Editor:
You condemn an entire medium instead of focusing on the failure of those in the cited studies. The implied assumption is that if community and technical colleges in Washington and Virginia can't make online education work, then no one can.
At the University of Phoenix, our significant online and information technology capacities have created systems that identify when students are struggling with course work and steer them toward remediation, reducing the attrition rate cited in your editorial.
As you point out, online education is booming. Rather than shun it, we must embrace and improve it, acknowledging that this medium will provide the best opportunity to bridge the widening skills gap.
MARK BRENNER Phoenix, Feb. 22, 2013
The writer is senior vice president, external affairs, of the Apollo Group, parent of the University of Phoenix.

HEADLINE: Teacher Layoffs

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Dale Lambert, the director of student services for the Great Falls Public Schools in Montana, is trying to solve a complex math problem these days: how to limit the number of teachers he would have to lay off under the automatic federal spending cuts. 
The district of just over 10,000 students is vulnerable to impending reductions in a number of federal programs that help support public schools. It is eligible for money for low-income students and those in special-education classes, as well as for money that supports students on Native American reservations and the children of active-duty personnel and civilian workers at Malmstrom Air Force Base.
Mr. Lambert and Cheryl K. Crawley, the superintendent, are braced to present a list of planned layoffs to the school board next month. Twenty teachers could be at risk.
Mr. Lambert said he feared that he would have to raise student-teacher ratios in classes for students with cognitive delays or autism. ''The budget is that narrow and that tight,'' he said.
The challenges reflect others across the country as schools prepare for what could be $2 billion in federal cuts. The Department of Education estimates that more than 10,000 jobs could be affected. That would come on top of the approximately 290,000 local education jobs lost during the recession and its aftermath.
The Great Falls district could take a disproportionately severe hit because of the number of students whose parents work at the Air Force base. Mr. Lambert calculates that job losses at the base would affect about 1,260 students in the district. If half of those families moved out to find jobs elsewhere, the district could be forced to cut about 60 more teaching jobs. MOTOKO RICH

HEADLINE: Miami-Dade Sees Failure In Company It Favored

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- When Banah International Group, a sugar company, agreed to establish its headquarters in Miami-Dade County -- lured by $430,000 in state and county tax breaks -- the announcement was trumpeted from County Hall to Capitol Hill.
The county's mayor, Carlos Gimenez, last year named a stretch of road in Hialeah as Banah Sweet Way. A former Florida congressman issued Banah's chairman a Congressional certificate. Business groups lauded the company's commitment to staying in Miami-Dade County and vouched for its economic health. 
But after falling under a load of debt, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday, just over a year after the tax incentives were approved. That development has raised new questions about how thoroughly the company was vetted by Enterprise Florida, the state agency that decides who should receive tax breaks here.
In addition, Banah's chairman, Alexander I. Perez, is a convicted cocaine trafficker who served a four-year sentence in federal prison and was released in 2007, a fact that Banah did not disclose when the company applied for a tax break from the state. Mr. Perez's probation ended in 2009.
''Taxpayers have already footed the bill for his time in jail,'' said State Representative Mike Fasano, a Republican who sits on the subcommittee that oversees Enterprise Florida. ''Let's not reward him for a business that winds up going belly up. There needs to be a lot more vetting and transparency here.''
Banah's bankruptcy filing comes as Enterprise Florida, a private-public agency that serves as the state's chief economic development agency, faces increased scrutiny from watchdog groups and lawmakers. Gov. Rick Scott, a former health care executive, has made job creation the centerpiece of his administration. This year, he has asked the Legislature to more than double the budget for Enterprise Florida to $297 million from $111 million.
But some lawmakers are skeptical about the request. This month, Integrity Florida, a watchdog group, issued its second report calling into question Enterprise Florida's effectiveness and criticizing it as lacking transparency. The report raised concerns about how board members are chosen and how their bonuses are awarded, and pointed out potential conflicts of interest.
Banah is one of several companies that ultimately failed to live up to its end of a tax-incentive agreement, which was to create jobs and invest in Florida.
''Things haven't changed,'' said Daniel B. Krassner, the executive director of Integrity Florida. ''They are not vetting these companies well enough to ensure that tax resources are protected.''
Responding to news of Banah's bankruptcy filing, Enterprise Florida said the company had not received any of the tax breaks, which were to be rolled out over time if it met its job-creation obligations.
Enterprise Florida has also criticized Integrity Florida, saying it is financed by Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group that the agency said was philosophically opposed to tax incentives.
Gray Swoope, the head of Enterprise Florida, has defended the agency, saying tax incentives had created 103,000 jobs since 1995 at a taxpayer cost of $335 million. Many of those contracts are shielded from the public.
Mr. Swoope said last month: ''The story is more jobs, better wages, better return and less money going out. It's a strong story.''
Still, the questions have caught the attention of leading Republican state lawmakers. They wonder whether too much incentive money is going to large corporations like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., as opposed to smaller Florida businesses. Because the agency lacks a searchable database, it is difficult to know how grant money was allocated.
''I'm personally planning on really critiquing them, because it's hundreds of millions of dollars we're spending on these programs,'' State Senator Joe Negron, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said this month. ''If these companies are going to come here anyway and expand here anyway, then they don't need parting gifts from the Legislature.''
Enterprise Florida, which was created in 1996 to take the place of the Commerce Department, is the first place companies go to ask for tax incentives. The group is charged with assessing companies and passing a pared-down list of candidates to the State Department of Economic Opportunity for a decision.

HEADLINE: 'Shareholder Democracy' Can Mask Abuses

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Martin Lipton, one of the nation's top corporate lawyers, was dismayed.
Having watched David Einhorn, the activist investor, go to battle with Apple in the last two weeks to push it to distribute some of its $137 billion cash hoard to shareholders, Mr. Lipton had seen enough. Mr. Einhorn, he thought, had gone too far.
A longtime counselor to the Fortune 500 as one of the founding partners of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, he sat down and wrote a scathing memo to his clients on his view that ''shareholder democracy'' has run amok.
''The activist-hedge-fund attack on Apple -- in which one of the most successful, long-term-visionary companies of all time is being told by a money manager that Apple is doing things all wrong and should focus on short-term return of cash -- is a clarion call for effective action to deal with the misuse of shareholder power,'' he wrote. The memo was entitled, ''Bite the Apple; Poison the Apple; Paralyze the Company; Wreck the Economy.'' 
Mr. Lipton said that long-term shareholders in public companies are being undermined ''by a gaggle of activist hedge funds who troll through S.E.C. filings looking for opportunities to demand a change in a company's strategy or portfolio that will create a short-term profit without regard to the impact on the company's long-term prospects.''
While ''shareholder democracy'' may be a good sound bite, Mr. Lipton has a point worth considering.
It increasingly appears that the rise of ''shareholder democracy'' is leading, in some cases, to a perverse game in which so-called activist investors take to the media to pump or dump stocks in hopes of creating a fleeting rise or fall in a company's stock price. The battle over Apple is just one minor example. Carl Icahn's investment in Herbalife, betting against William Ackman's accusation that the company is a ''pyramid scheme,'' is another.
That's not to say that shareholder democracy is a bad thing. Shareholders have successfully and properly brought pressure to bear on underperforming companies, pushed out entrenched directors and, in some cases, pressed for operational changes to address health and the environment.
At a time when investors are calling for managements and directors to think more about the long term, this latest breed of activism is also multiplying. But are these activists interested in the long term?
According to Leo E. Strine Jr., the chief judge of the Delaware Court of Chancery, the answer is usually obvious: no.
''Many activist investors hold their stock for a very short period of time and may have the potential to reap profits based on short-term trading strategies that arbitrage corporate policies,'' he wrote in a widely circulated essay for the American Bar Association. Near the beginning of his essay he asked: ''Why should we expect corporations to chart a sound long-term course of economic growth, if the so-called investors who determine the fate of their managers do not themselves act or think with the long term in mind?''
The academic literature provides a mixed and inconclusive assessment of the true effect of activism on shareholder value over the long-term.
In fairness, it must be said that not all activist investors are created equal and not all of their investments should be considered in the same way. Nelson Peltz, once called a corporate raider, fought his way onto the board of Heinz in 2006. He is still on the board and approved the sale of the company to Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital just weeks ago.
Daniel Loeb, the founder of Third Point Management, similarly fought his way onto the board of Yahoo after exposing its former chief executive, Scott Thomson, for lying on his résumé. He is now a board member and helped recruit Marissa Mayer to be chief executive. Whether he likes it or not, Mr. Loeb is a long-term shareholder in Yahoo. Just weeks ago, however, he announced that he had made an investment in Herbalife that his peer, Mr. Ackman, is betting against. Part of Mr. Loeb's bet was simply a short-term gamble; he has since sold some of his investment, taking profits off the table.
Similarly, Mr. Ackman has made some long-term bets -- he held his short position in MBIA for years and is now a long-term investor and director of J. C.Penney -- but he has also made a series of short-term investments as well.
As for Mr. Einhorn's fight with Apple, it is hard to argue he is a short-term investor in the company; his firm, Greenlight Capital, has held a stake for the past three years. But the measures he is pressing the company to pursue -- creating a ''iPref'' or preferred share that pays a dividend to shareholders in perpetuity -- feel a lot like financial engineering to create some quick value for investors.
In a news release announcing his proposal, which would have Apple create $50 billion in perpetual preferred stock, Mr. Einhorn said that amount of the new shares ''would unlock about $30 billion, or $32 per share in value. Greenlight believes that Apple has the capacity to ultimately distribute several hundred billion dollars of preferred, which would unlock hundreds of dollars of value per share.'' He continued, ''Greenlight believes additional value may be realized when Apple's price-to-earnings multiple expands, as the market appreciates a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy.''
In truth, Mr. Einhorn's proposal is a lot more long-term thinking than just pressing Apple to distribute a special one-time dividend or pursue a series of stock buybacks; his proposal requires shareholders to remain so as to reap the dividends the special ''iPrefs'' would throw off. But make no mistake, Mr. Einhorn is also hoping that Apple's common shares will jump in price if Apple takes up his proposal.
Mr. Einhorn declined to comment for this column.
I've had my own run-ins with Mr. Lipton. In 2008, before the financial crisis, I wrote a column questioning Mr. Lipton's various efforts ''to stiff-arm the people who actually own the company.'' At the time, he wrote a memo arguing that the ''limits on executive compensation, splitting the role of chairman and C.E.O. and efforts to impose shareholder referendums on matters that have been the province of boards should be resisted.''
As the inventor of the anti-takeover maneuver called the ''poison pill'' and as one who has made a career trying to protect boards from agitators, Mr. Lipton was talking his own book. I wrote, ''Mr. Lipton's advice isn't just wrongheaded. It's dangerous.''
But nearly five years later, with the perspective of the financial crisis, Mr. Lipton's underlying worry that certain shareholders will abuse the powers of democracy is not unfounded. The question, as is often the case, is whether the influence of a few interested in the short term overwhelms the best interests of the many in the long term.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Death by Davos

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The failure of Europe&#8217;s VSPs. 

 BODY:
This is the way the euro ends: not with the banks but with bunga-bunga.
OK, the euro isn't doomed - yet. But the Italian election signals that the eurocrats, who never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity, are getting very close to the edge. 
The fundamental fact is that a policy of austerity for all - incredibly harsh austerity in debtor nations, but some austerity in the European core too, and not a hint of expansionary policy anywhere - is a complete failure. None of the nations under Brussels/Berlin-imposed austerity has shown even a hint of economic recovery; unemployment is at society-destroying levels. 
This failure came close to destroying the euro twice, in late 2011 and again last summer, as debtor nations threatened to enter a doom loop of plunging bond prices and failing banks. Each time Mario Draghi and the ECB stepped in to contain the damage, first by lending to the banks buying sovereign debt (LTRO) then by announcing a willingness to buy sovereign debt directly (OMT) ; but rather than taking the near-death experience as a warning, Europe's austerians took the ECB-engineered calming of markets as a sign that austerity was working.
Well, the suffering voters of Europe just told them differently.
How could they not have seen this coming? Well, in Europe even more than in the US the Very Serious People live in a bubble of self-regard at their own seriousness, and imagine that the general public will follow their lead - hey, it's the only responsible thing to do. Wolfgang Münchau has a great lede in his column today, that gets at the essence:
There was a symbolic moment in the Italian elections when I knew that the game was up for Mario Monti, the defeated prime minister. It was when in the middle of the campaign - in the midst of an anti-establishment insurgence - he took off to Davos to be with his friends from international finance and politics. I know his visit to elite gathering in the Swiss mountains was not an issue in the campaign, but it signalled to me an almost comic lack of political realism.
What Europe's VSPs fail to get is that the public perception of their right to lead depends on achieving at least some actual results. What they have actually delivered, however, is years of incredible pain accompanied by repeated promises that recovery is just around the corner - and then they wonder that many voters no longer trust their judgment, and turn to someone, anyone, who offers an alternative.
I wish I believed that the Italian election would serve as a wake-up call - a reason to, for example, give the ECB a green light for more expansion, a reason for Germany to do some stimulus and for France to call off its unnecessary belt-tightening. My guess, however, is that we'll just have more lectures to the Italians and everyone else about how they just aren't trying hard enough.
And there may be worse figures than Beppe Grillo lurking in Europe's future.

HEADLINE: Private Equity Players See Signs of Excess in Buyout Market

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Speaking at the annual SuperReturn conference in Berlin, several private equity executives discussed concerns about the recent flurry of deal-making activity. 

 BODY:
BERLIN - The buyout market is showing signs of the excesses that led to the financial crisis, leading private equity managers say.
Speaking at an annual private equity conference in Berlin, Howard S. Marks, chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, said investors continued to pay high prices for companies and were tapping into growing amounts of cheap credit to finance takeovers. 
"We are seeing some elements of precrisis behavior," Mr. Marks said on Tuesday at the SuperReturn International 2013 conference. "We are seeing people engaging in bullish behavior."
His comments come after a series of recent multibillion-dollar deals, which have raised expectations that debt-fueled buyouts are back.
Michael S. Dell and Silver Lake struck a $24 billion deal this month to buy Dell, the computer maker. And Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and the Brazilian firm 3G Capital have agreed to pay $23 billion to acquire H.J. Heinz, the maker of Heinz ketchup.
As fears wane over the European debt crisis and the American presidential election, access to capital markets has slowly returned, including debt financing for potential deals.
Over the last two years, investors have flooded into the world's debt markets. The greater demand for bonds and other products has allowed firms to tap into the capital markets, including the so-called high-yield market that has traditionally funded riskier investments.
The growing ability to finance deals has led to increasingly higher price tags on potential deals, according to Leon D. Black, chief executive of the private equity giant Apollo Global Management.
"With easy money, there's a temptation to pay higher prices," Mr. Black said on Tuesday "There's no institutional memory, we know that about Wall Street."
For Mr. Black, the cost of potential European deals remains higher than investments in the United States despite the lack of economic growth and continuing political risk across the Continent. Cheap short-term funding from the European Central Bank has eased pressure on local banks to sell badly performing investments, while many corporate buyers have been able to raise money in the financial markets to finance their divisions.
There are opportunities, particularly in so-called distressed assets like loan portfolios that banks are looking to shed, though the returns are unlikely to match those of previous eras, he said.
"We like opportunities in distressed assets in Europe," Mr. Black said. "If the M.&A. spigot opens up, you may see buyouts, but with high-teen returns."
Investors also say they have learned lessons from the financial crisis.
In the boom times, private equity giants like Bain Capital secured multibillion-dollar takeovers by loading companies with debt. Some of these investments ran into trouble when the financial markets imploded, and prompted some private equity firms to shy away from large deals.
To succeed, investors must redouble their efforts to help companies improve revenue, not look for profit through highly-leveraged deals, according to Mark Nunnelly, managing director at Bain Capital.
"If you're making investments driven by the capital markets, you take more risks," Mr. Nunnelly said on Tuesday. "Wall Street tends to have a short memory."

HEADLINE: Nides Rejoins Morgan Stanley From State Dept.

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Morgan Stanley has announced that Thomas R. Nides, who served as its chief operating officer until early 2011, will return as a vice chairman. 

 BODY:
A former top Morgan Stanley official is coming back to the firm, after a two-year stint at the State Department under Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Morgan Stanley announced on Tuesday that Thomas R. Nides, who served as its chief operating officer until early 2011, would return as a vice chairman. In that role, he will have wide-ranging responsibilities covering clients and external and government affairs. 
He will also serve on Morgan Stanley's operating and management committees
Mr. Nides will report to James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chairman and chief executive, and will work with the heads of Morgan Stanley's core securities and wealth management businesses, Colm Kelleher and Gregory J. Fleming.
"We are excited to have Tom rejoin the management team, this time focusing on the firm's clients," Mr. Gorman said in a statement. "His deep experience over the past 25 years in government and financial services uniquely qualifies him to deliver the full capabilities of Morgan Stanley to our current and prospective clients globally."
The homecoming will be Mr. Nides's first stop from Washington, where he served as deputy secretary of state for management and resources, focused on internal operations for the agency.
He had previously worked at Morgan Stanley for five years, joining when his boss at Credit Suisse, John J. Mack, returned to lead the firm. Mr. Nides served as one of Mr. Mack's top lieutenants and helped steer the investment bank through the financial crisis.
And earlier in his career, Mr. Nides worked as chief executive of the public relations firm Burson-Marsteller.
But politics had been the starting point of his career: He was chief of staff for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman during the 2000 presidential campaign; an aide to a former House speaker, Thomas S. Foley; and chief of staff for Mickey Kantor, a former United States trade representative.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Pay Rises, for Those Who Still Have a Job

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: The average cash bonus for people employed in New York City in the financial industry rose by roughly 9 percent, to $121,900, in 2012, the New York State comptroller said. 

 BODY:
 7:39 p.m. | Updated 
Wall Street may be shrinking - cutting thousands of jobs over the last year - but for those who remain, the pay is still very lucrative. 
The average cash bonus for those employed in the financial industry in New York last year rose roughly 9 percent, to $121,900, Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York State's comptroller, said on Tuesday.
Cash bonuses in total are forecast to increase by roughly 8 percent, to $20 billion this year.
The total, however, is down from 2010, when it was $22.8 billion. Wall Street's peak came in 2006, before the financial crisis, with a total $34.3 billion in bonuses. The year-end bonus can account for the bulk of a finance professional's annual compensation.
The report from the state comptroller's office gives estimates on the bonuses, based on tax withholding data, data from banks and conversations with industry experts. It came the same day that JPMorgan Chase, one of the country's biggest banks, announced it was eliminating 17,000 jobs over the next two years through layoffs and attrition, adding its name to a string of large banks that continue to cut jobs to reduce expenses.
Wall Street has regained 30 percent of the 28,300 jobs lost during the financial crisis, Mr. DiNapoli said. And firms are continuing to streamline as they cope with a sluggish economic recovery, difficult markets and a heavier regulatory burden. While financial industry employment in New York City was steady in the first half of 2012, it was down slightly in the second half of the year, the comptroller's office said.
"Wall Street is still in transition, but it is very slowly adjusting to changes in its economic and regulatory environment," he said.
In an effort to hold down - albeit temporarily - compensation costs, a number of financial firms have deferred cash payments to employees in recent years. Mr. DiNapoli said on Tuesday that part of the increase in 2012 was cash promised in recent years but actually paid out last year. He said that it was difficult to break out what percentage of the total was deferrals, but he believed that it was still a small part of the total.
The ebbs and flows of Wall Street pay have a major impact on the economy of New York City, where 169,700 are employed in finance. Local businesses like restaurants, luxury goods retailers and the upper end of the real estate market pin their fortunes to the flood of cash from year-end bonuses.
Before the start of the financial crisis, business and personal income tax collections from finance-related activities accounted for up to 20 percent of New York State tax revenue. In 2012, that contribution fell to 14 percent.
Yet finance remains the best paying sector in New York City, Mr. DiNapoli told reporters during a conference call.
All told, the average pay package for securities industry employees in New York was $362,900 in 2011, the last year for which data is available, almost unchanged from 2010.
"Profits and bonuses rebounded in 2012, but the industry is still restructuring," Mr. DiNapoli said. Despite its smaller size, the securities industry is still a very important part of the New York City and New York State economies."

HEADLINE: Beware of Investments Promoted as 'Just Like a C.D.'

BYLINE: CARL RICHARDS


HIGHLIGHT: The answer to the double whammy of investment losses in 2008-9 and low interest rates now on savings accounts is not some dubious new product. 

 BODY:
 Carl Richards is a financial planner in Park City, Utah, and is the director of investor education at the BAM Alliance. His book, "The Behavior Gap," was published last year. His sketches are archived on the Bucks blog.
A recentNew York Times article highlighted the sad trend of investors getting fleeced after putting their money in exotic, alternative investments they hoped would help them recover from past investing losses. 
I understand the problem. Many of us lost a bunch of money in 2008-9. And if you're retired or coming up on retirement, the situation is even tougher. You're sitting on less money than you planned for and have little time to rebuild your savings.
At the same time, you may have been planning to live off the income from that money. But with interest rates near zero, the income you can safely earn has been cut dramatically.
It's a double whammy! Less money, earning less interest.
That is leading to a frantic search for alternative investments that can make up the difference quickly.
Often the search for a "solution" comes in two flavors:

        
Looking for investments that will grow fast. This is a bit like doubling down at the casino to make up for losses, often with the same outcome.
        
Looking for investments that pay higher interest. This is also called "chasing yield." When traditional, income-generating vehicles like savings accounts or certificates of deposit are paying next to nothing, you start looking for something "just as safe," but with a higher interest rate.
Enter slick salespeople with alternative investments that just happen to solve your problem. One sentence in the Times article perfectly illustrates this point:
While the offering was unfamiliar - part ownership in a fleet of luxury cars - Ms. Beck bought the pitch because her broker had been around for years, and the product offered what seemed to be a modest annual interest rate of 7 percent.
Who wouldn't prefer a "modest 7 percent" return to living with stock market gyrations or earning 1.5 percent on a bank C.D.? Sign me up!
It would be great if we could find an alternative investment like this, but what we're really talking about is finding an alternative to the basic idea of taking a risk to generate a return. The trouble is that risk and expected return are still - and will always be - closely related.
Take, for instance, stock mutual funds, which come with the risk that the value of your investment will go up or down a lot in the short term. The reward comes over the long term, with the higher returns historically associated with owning stock versus other types of investments.
Now there are other "safer" investments that don't come with as much risk, but offer a smaller reward, like bank C.D.'s. It's common to see alternative investments pitched as comparable to these safe investments, but the numbers tell a different story.
The current average one-year C.D. nationwide pays 0.6 percent, and a five-year Treasury bill yields 0.78 percent. Those returns should give you a benchmark for the return on a relatively low-risk investment.
So when someone comes to you offering an investment that's "just like a C.D.," but it pays 7 percent, guess what: This investment is NOT just like a C.D. If it was just like a C.D., it would pay you what you expect a C.D. to yield.
Yes, we're in a terrible, tight spot. But the answer isn't to hope that a dubious, new product someone sells you will solve your problem. The odds are high it will only make things worse.
Let's use these sad stories of fraud and loss as a important reminder. Be honest with yourself if you discover what appears to be a brilliant loophole to the fundamental rules of investing. As tough as the current situation is, you're likely to make things worse when you think you can separate risk from expected returns.

HEADLINE: Did Democrats Get Lucky in the Electoral College?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The tendency of Democrats to cluster in urban areas has harmed them in the House of Representatives, but not in the Electoral College. 

 BODY:
President Obama won the Electoral College fairly decisively last year despite a margin of just 3.8 percentage points in the national popular vote. In fact, Mr. Obama would probably have won the Electoral College even if the popular vote had slightly favored Mitt Romney. The "tipping-point state" in the election - the one that provided Mr. Obama with his decisive 270th electoral vote - was Colorado, which Mr. Obama won by 5.4 percentage points. If all states had shifted toward Mr. Romney by 5.3 percentage points, Mr. Obama would still have won Colorado and therefore the Electoral College - despite losing the national popular vote by 1.5 points.
Contrast this Democratic advantage in the Electoral College with the Republican advantage in the House of Representatives. Democrats actually won slightly more votes in the House elections last year (about 59.5 million votes to the G.O.P.'s 58 million). Nevertheless, Republicans maintained a 234-201 majority in the House, losing only eight seats.
Democrats are quick to attribute the Republican advantage in the House to gerrymandering. This is certainly a part of the story. Republicans benefited from having an extremely strong election in 2010, giving them control of the redistricting process in many states. (Although Democrats were no less aggressive about creating gerrymandered districts in states like Illinois.) 
However, much or most of the Republican advantage in the House results from geography rather than deliberate attempts to gerrymander districts. Liberals tend to cluster in dense urban centers, creating districts in which Democrats might earn as much as 80 or 90 percent of the vote. In contrast, even the most conservative districts in the country tend not to give more than about 70 or 75 percent of their vote to Republicans. This means that Democrats have more wasted votes in the cities than Republicans do in the countryside, depriving Democrats of votes at the margin in swing districts. Eliminating partisan gerrymandering would reduce the G.O.P.'s advantage in the House but not eliminate it.
But if this geographic principle holds true for the House, why doesn't the same apply for the Electoral College?
Actually, it might hold true, if state boundaries were drawn a different way, and the states were required to have equal populations (as Congressional districts are). Neil Freeman, a graphic artist and urban planner, created just such a map in which the nation's population was divided into 50 states of equal population. Mr. Freeman's map also sought to keep metro areas within the same state - so, for instance, Kansas City and its suburbs would be entirely within the new state of "Nodaway" rather than divided between Kansas and Missouri.
Nate Cohn, of The New Republic, calculated what would have happened had the Electoral College been contested under Mr. Freeman's map. He found that Mr. Romney probably would have won, by virtue of narrow victories in the new tipping-point states of Susquehanna (which consists of portions of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Maryland) and Pocono (formed from rural and suburban portions of present-day Pennsylvania and New York).
We must qualify Mr. Cohn's answer because the margin would have been so close in these states that the election would have gone to a recount. Nonetheless, the new boundaries would have been enough to shift us from a map in which Democrats had an Electoral College advantage (relative to their share of the popular vote) to one in which it would have considerably helped Mr. Romney.
Mr. Cohn concludes from this that the Democrats' apparent advantage in the Electoral College is "a product of luck." If state boundaries were drawn just slightly differently, the Electoral College might harm them rather than help them, he argues.
I've seen a couple of objections to Mr. Cohn's claim, one of which is that Mr. Obama's strategy was dictated by the Electoral College as currently configured. Had the new states of Susquehanna and Pocono been the tipping-point states, instead of Colorado and Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama would have directed more resources there and might have won them as a result.
This is an intriguing argument, and an important one for thinking about the Electoral College in 2016 and beyond. If Mr. Obama's apparent advantage in the Electoral College in 2008 and 2012 was the result of superior voter-targeting operations, then Democrats will maintain that advantage as long as they remain ahead in the voter-targeting game, but no longer.
Still, I doubt that this is enough to explain all of the difference between Mr. Freeman's map and the actual Electoral College. Most empirical research on Mr. Obama's "ground game" has found that it might have been worth an extra one to three percentage points in the swing states. In other words, Mr. Obama's turnout operation might be enough to explain why the Electoral College slightly favored him rather than being essentially neutral. However, the inference we might make from Mr. Freeman's map, and from the distribution of votes in Congressional districts, is that the Electoral College should not merely have been neutral but should actually have favored Republicans by several percentage points because of the concentration of Democratic voters in urban areas.
So why hasn't the tendency of Democrats to cluster in urban areas harmed them in the Electoral College, as it has in the House of Representatives?
We can gain some insight by comparing the distribution of votes under the actual Electoral College to that which would have resulted under Mr. Freeman's map. I've done that in the chart below. The chart orders the states and the District of Columbia based on what share of the vote Mr. Obama received in each one. (The percentages listed are two-way vote shares, meaning that they exclude votes for third-party candidates.)
There is one technicality to explain in these results. Although Mr. Freeman assigns most of the population of Washington, D.C., into a new state with portions of Virginia and Maryland, he preserves a small region consisting of the National Mall, major monuments and federal buildings "set off as the seat of the federal government", as might be required under the Constitution. This remaining part of the District of Columbia would still have three electoral votes despite having a permanent population of only about 33 people. (This is as best as I can infer from census data: the area corresponds to census tract 62.02 in the District of Columbia. Presumably, it would still be extremely Democratic, as its population might consist largely of Mr. Obama and his family, and high-level officials in his administration.)
That aside, the key facet of the chart is what happens in the upper-right corner, where the orange line (which represents how electoral votes would be allocated under Mr. Freeman's system) diverges significantly from the black line (which reflects how they are allocated today). This reflects the results in the new states that are centered around Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, all of which would have given Mr. Obama at least 65 percent of their vote. Collectively, these "city-states" would represent about 65 electoral votes in Mr. Freeman's map. By comparison, the only present-day states to have given Mr. Obama at least 65 percent of their vote were Hawaii and Vermont, which together have just seven electoral votes. The superfluous votes in these "city-states" wind up costing Democrats dearly in swing states like Pocono.
These large cities create much less electoral wastage for Democrats under the current map. Let's consider each of them individually:
 Philadelphia. Mr. Obama's margin of victory in Pennsylvania (about 300,000 votes) was less than his margin of victory in the city Philadelphia alone (about 470,000 votes). Mr. Obama also netted about 100,000 votes from the Philadelphia suburbs. If Philadelphia and its suburbs seceded from the rest of Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama would win the city-state of Philadelphia overwhelmingly but would probably lose what remained of Pennsylvania.
 Washington. The District of Columbia itself yields some wasted votes for Democrats. (Although it should be noted that it is overrepresented in the Electoral College: it has roughly one electoral vote per 100,000 voters, versus a national average of 0.4 electoral votes per 100,000 voters.) However, Washington's suburbs have now also become Democratic, enough to swing Virginia to Mr. Obama in the last two elections. Thus, Democrats get considerable leverage out of the Washington metro area under the current Electoral College. Under Mr. Freeman's map, Democrats would win the city-state centered around Washington overwhelmingly, but the regions just beyond it would mostly go Republican.
 Chicago. This is roughly the same case as Philadelphia. Mr. Obama actually lost Illinois outside of Cook County, which consists of Chicago and its immediate suburbs. Thus, Democrats won all 20 electoral votes in Illinois. If Cook County separated from the rest of the state, by contrast, Mr. Obama would have won its roughly 10 electoral votes but lost the 10 belonging to the rest of Illinois.
 San Francisco and Los Angeles. Mr. Obama won California by about 3 million votes last year. Of this advantage, about 2 million votes came from the San Francisco and Los Angeles metro areas, as Mr. Freeman defines them. California would still be Democratic-leaning without them, but Republicans would have some chance of competing instead of Democrats automatically having 55 electoral votes in their column. The G.O.P. would be further helped if California were broken apart into a total of four or five states, as Republicans could perform well in states centered around San Diego or the Central Valley.
 New York. Mr. Obama won New York state by about eight percentage points, excluding votes from New York City itself. Without the five boroughs, therefore, New York state would be a blue-leaning swing state, similar to Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota, instead of a safely Democratic one.
In other words, under the current map, the votes in these big cities don't wind up being redundant. They allow Democrats to win Pennsylvania, Illinois and Virginia when they would otherwise usually lose them. California and New York would still be Democratic-leaning even without San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City, but Democrats get to win all their electoral votes whereas some regions would be competitive if they were subdivided. (The aforementioned swing state of Pocono consists partly of upstate New York under Mr. Freeman's map, for example.)
I would also take objection to Mr. Cohn's notion that the allocation of the United States into its 50 states should be thought of as a matter of "luck" - as though it reflects one draw from a randomly-generated pool of alternatives. Certainly, the boundaries of the states are quirky in some ways: Vermont, for instance, could easily have wound up as part of New York or New Hampshire.
But as books like "How The States Got Their Shapes" make clear, many other states have boundaries that were the result of careful deliberation by Congress. In particular, there was an effort to grant them roughly equal amounts of geographic territory, and to allow them to share access to important natural resources like the Great Lakes. (Most of the exceptions are in states that were brought into the nation whole-hog, like California and Texas, or the 13 original colonies.) 
Here's a thought experiment: if you could play geographer king, and were charged with dividing the United States into 50 political units with the goal of maximizing the nation's collective economic well-being, what would your map look like? Would it be more like Mr. Freeman's map, with the states divided based on equal populations and urban continuity, or would it be more our actual map of 50 states, however haphazard it might seem?
I don't think this question has a simple answer, but there are some things to be said for the status quo.
Mr. Freeman's map runs the risk of creating some small, urban states that are rich in human capital but lack natural resources, and some gargantuan, rural states that have the opposite problem. Under the actual map, most states have a reasonably good balance of urban and rural areas. The chart below reflects the percentage of voters in each state that are in urban, suburban and rural areas, according to 2008 exit polls. (The exit polls did not contain good data for Alaska and Hawaii, so I had to infer these separately.) Some 33 of the 50 states have somewhere between 20 and 50 percent of their populations in urban areas. Only one state (Nevada) has more than half its population in urban centers (Nevada occupies a large amount of territory, but most of its population is in Las Vegas). Only eight have under 10 percent of their population in urban areas (including New Jersey, which is otherwise suburban rather than rural).
This is not to say that the allocation of territory and resources into the states is perfect. From an economic standpoint, it's hard to justify Delaware being its own state, or California being one state instead of two or more. And the geographic size of a state would have been a better proxy for its economic potential in the early days of the Republic, when the United States was primarily an agrarian nation.
But it also shouldn't be thought of as merely coincidental that Chicago, for example, happens to be attached to the territory that makes up the rest of Illinois. Seeking to equalize populations across the states would have made it harder for Congress to equalize other types of resources between them. Illinois "needs" to have a larger-than-average population because the alternative would be to create a rich city-state of Chicago (but one that lacked agricultural or mining resources) and a poor state of Downstate Illinois (which had lots of farmland but no large cities and no access to Lake Michigan).
As a byproduct of the Congress's goal of equalizing geographic resources across the states, most states have reasonably diverse populations and economic interests, and the income distribution across the states is reasonably even. The poorest state in 2009 was Mississippi, which had a median household income of about $35,000, while the wealthiest was New Jersey (about $65,000). This range is narrow when compared to almost any other type of geographic division. More than 90 of the 435 Congressional districts, for instance, fell somewhere outside this range.
As a result, the Electoral College does not convey all that much advantage to rural voters versus urban ones, or wealthy voters versus poorer ones, and therefore does not provide all that much long-term advantage toward either party. The Democrats slightly benefited from the Electoral College in 2008 and 2012, but the opposite was true as recently as 2000.
The Electoral College may nevertheless be a flawed system in that some votes count much more than others. This is not intended as an enthusiastic defense of it, as much as a warning that attempts to reform it could wind up exacerbating its flaws (as opposed to eliminating it entirely, as would be my preference).
The best feature of the Electoral College is that it takes advantage of the 50 states. And those states got their shapes not by luck but by design.

HEADLINE: Lexus Ranked No. 1 on Consumer Reports Annual Report Card

BYLINE: CHERYL JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Subaru and Mazda tied for second, Toyota came in fourth and Acura fifth. This is the first year the magazine used its new grading system for the report. 

 BODY:
 10:46 a.m. | Updated Lexus earned the top overall score of 79 in the Consumer Reports 2013 Annual Report Card, the magazine announced on Tuesday.
Subaru and Mazda tied for second with scores of 76. The magazine said both brands build solid cars that have good handling and fuel economy, are versatile and relatively affordable.
Rounding out the top five were Toyota and Acura with scores of 74. 
Honda scored a 72, hurt by the Insight and CR-Z, which had low scores.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz were the only non-Japanese brands to break into the top 10. Audi's score of 70 put it into 8th place and Mercedes was in 10th with a 69. Audi was the only European brand to have very good reliability over all along with an excellent road-test score.
Eight of the top 10 brands in the report were Japanese. Most Detroit brands were toward the bottom, with European brands generally in the middle.
The magazine used a new grading system this year. In the past, the magazine calculated one overall score for each automaker, but this year there are separate scores for each brand and for individual brands. In the case of Toyota, its three brands, Lexus, Scion and Toyota, get separate scores. Ford also gets separate scores for the Ford and Lincoln brands instead of just one overall score for Ford.
It is more in line with the way consumers shop, the magazine said. Grouping Scion with Lexus doesn't make a lot of sense from a consumer's point of view "since they are rarely cross-shopped," Jake Fisher, director of automotive testing for Consumer Reports, said in a telephone interview.
The 2013 Annual Brand Report Card rankings, Top Picks and more were released by the magazine at a news conference before the Washington Automotive Press Association in Washington.
A brand's score is calculated using road test and reliability scores, equally weighted, for each of the models tested. The reliability scores come from information provided by the magazine's subscribers during its Annual Auto Survey.
The bottom five on the Report Card were Chrysler with a score of 52, Ford with 51, Lincoln with 50, Jeep with 47 and Dodge at the very bottom with 46.
Although the new Dodge Dart is an improvement over other small cars from Dodge, "it is not nearly up to the levels of the best competitors," Mr. Fisher said.
Ford and Lincoln are still suffering from problems with the MyFord and MyLincoln Touch infotainment systems, as well as with the dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Those two issues hurt Ford (including Lincoln) in last year's Report Card as well.
Ford has made some improvements, but not nearly enough; and problems are spreading as more vehicles have the MyFord and MyLincoln Touch system, Mr. Fisher said.
Those issues have been joined by performance issues related to Ford's new 1.6-liter and 2-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engines.
"They both have less performance and drink more fuel than the competitors; it hurts their road test scores," Mr. Fisher said.
To be included, the magazine must have data for at least three models, which meant Fiat, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mitsubishi, Porsche, Ram and Smart were not rated.
The April issue will be on newsstands March 5 and online for subscribers to the magazine's Web site on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Deaths of Teenage Drivers Spiked in First Half of 2012, Report Says

BYLINE: TANYA MOHN


HIGHLIGHT: The death toll for 16- and 17-year-old drivers of passenger vehicles jumped 19 percent, compared with the first half of 2011, a study by the Governors Highway Safety Association finds. 

 BODY:
Fatalities among teenage drivers rose sharply for the first six months of 2012, according to a new report.
The death toll for 16- and 17-year-old drivers of passenger vehicles jumped 19 percent, compared with the first half of 2011.
"It's troubling" said Barbara L. Harsha, executive director the Governors Highway Safety Association, an organization representing state highway safety offices that released the study, "Teenage Driver Fatalities by State: 2012 Preliminary Data," on Tuesday. 
Based on initial data supplied by the 50 states and the District of Columbia for the first six months of 2012, 25 states reported increases, 17 showed a decrease, and eight states and the District of Columbia reported no change. Over all, 16- and 17-year-old driver deaths increased from 202 to 240.
"Even though the numbers are pretty small, 19 percent is pretty sizable," Ms. Harsha said in a telephone interview. "We didn't expect the increase to be as large as it is, so that's a concern." 
She said the data did not include passengers, bicyclists or pedestrians. "We only looked at drivers, as that is the group most involved in fatal crashes," Ms. Harsha said.
If the trend persisted in the second half of the year, it would be the second year of increased deaths for teenage drivers in this age group after eight consecutive years of decline. Final data is not available for 2012, but fatalities typically go up in the second half of the year, she said.
The spike in teenage driver deaths appears to have increased at an even greater rate than overall highway fatalities during this same period, Allan Williams, a road safety consultant who wrote the report, said in a telephone interview. He based the projections on data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Safety Council.
Despite these increases, the deaths of teenage drivers remain historically low and are still better than they were five or even 10 years ago, he said.
"But anytime there is a favorable trend and it reverses, there is concern and alarm. We don't want that to continue to happen," said Mr. Williams, who is the former chief scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit group financed by the insurance industry. "We don't want that to continue to happen."
While it is too soon to know for certain, he attributes the increase in fatalities, in part, to a rebounding economy. With lower gas prices during the study period and greater discretionary income, more teenagers may be on the roads, which increases their exposure to risk.
Another contributing factor may be that progress has slowed among states to strengthen graduated driver licensing laws. All 50 states have some form of the laws that were first introduced in the mid-1990s to gradually grant privileges to teenage drivers during higher-risk situations, like driving at night or with peer passengers. Distracted driving is also thought to play a role, Mr. Williams said.
But while studies and surveys indicate that laws are not particularly effective in changing cellphone use, graduated driver licensing laws have proven to help reducing crashes.
"The more comprehensive state laws are, the greater the effect," he said.
Compliance is also essential, he said. "A lot, quite frankly, depends on parental involvement," he said. "But many parents don't even know what the laws are. They need to know what the laws are. They need to know what the rationales are."
In addition to strengthening laws and creating programs and awareness to increase parental supervision, improving driver education programs is also critical to reverse the upward trend, said Ms. Harsha, the executive director. "It's time to redouble our efforts."
The full report, including state-by-state data, is available online at ghsa.org.

HEADLINE: Mismeasurement of Federal Spending, Investment and Saving

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Failing to distinguish between consumption spending and investment spending has muddied the debate about the nation&#8217;s deficit and economy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Much of the motivation for deficit reduction, a goal shared by policy makers across the political spectrum, is the belief that deficits consume the nation's seed corn. That is, deficits represent negative saving. Because saving is presumed to be the key determinant of long-term real economic growth, deficits deplete the supply of saving and thus reduce growth. 
There are many problems with this analysis. One is that it assumes that all government spending is consumption. In fact, much of it consists of investment. According to the 2013 budget (see Section 21, Page 356), the federal government will invest $550 billion this year in physical capital (buildings, equipment), research and development and human capital (education). This includes grants to state and local governments for these purposes.
It is perfectly reasonable to finance long-lived capital projects with borrowing. Because the benefits will accrue over many years, it would be silly to treat things like highways as if they were consumed within a single year for budget purposes. Virtually all homeowners know this and borrow to buy homes. They understand that the flow of housing services they receive on an annual basis compensates for the interest that is paid.
Unfortunately, the federal budget is silly in this respect. It treats investment spending the same way every other budgetary item is treated - as if it were consumption with no long-lasting benefits for the nation.

An unfortunate consequence of this budgetary convention is that reducing federal investment is viewed as beneficial if it reduces the deficit. Moreover, it is often easier to cut investment spending than consumption, just as homeowners suffering from an income loss may find that deferring maintenance or planned improvements is the easiest way to conserve cash.
But just as deferred maintenance on our homes, like putting off repairs to the roof, can be very costly in the long run, reducing the value and hence the net worth of our principal asset, the same is true of government investment. Maintenance that is deferred too long may require assets that would have lasted many more years to be replaced prematurely at much higher cost.
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the nation is already in a net deficit position as far as building and maintaining its basic public infrastructure. The society estimates that the added costs to people and businesses from this underinvestment will reduce the aggregate gross domestic product by $3 trillion over the next decade. The group recommends an additional $1.1 trillion of public investment through 2020 to what is currently planned, $157 billion per year.
Of course, the federal government is not going to spend that much more because it would make the goal of balancing the budget more difficult, based on the way deficits are calculated, making no allowance for capital outlays. Indeed, it will be difficult to prevent cuts in investment outlays that will reduce such spending below current projections.
One solution to this problem would be to have a capital budget that segregates government investment spending from consumption spending. Virtually all the states do this already. Conservatives who routinely defend a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, on the grounds that the states must balance their budgets annually, appear to be unaware that such requirements apply only to operating budgets, excluding capital outlays.
If households were required to balance their budgets the way balanced-budget amendment supporters want the federal government to operate, they would almost never be able to buy homes or cars. Such outlays almost always exceed their annual incomes over and above consumption and would thus constitute deficit spending.
Of course, families could draw down savings to buy homes and cars. But that's an option not available to the government because it has no savings, only a large debt. Treating it and private individuals the same way, as balanced-budget supporters propose, would require the entire national debt to be paid off and a surplus accumulated before it would be permitted to make new investments in roads, bridges, buildings and other long-lived assets.
Of course, no one actually believes that. But it follows logically from arguments one often hears about why the government should balance its cash income and outlays annually, because that is supposedly how families and the states are said to operate. In fact, they don't.
The distinction between capital spending and consumption spending also affects the way economists interpret the rate of saving. The standard measure, produced by the Commerce Department, calculates personal income and personal outlays. The difference between these two figures is assumed to be personal saving. Thus saving is not calculated directly, but is merely a residual between income and spending.
An alternative measure of saving that treats consumer durables, like autos, as investments would raise the measured rate of saving considerably. Alternatively, one could measure saving directly from financial institutions and other sources, as the Federal Reserve does (see Page 17). This yields a much higher measure of saving. In 2011, the last full year available, the Commerce Department estimated the personal saving rate at 4.2 percent, while the Fed put it at 10.3 percent.
Periodically, administrations have suggested creating a capital budget, both to give clearer picture of the economic effects of federal spending and to shield investments from budget cuts that should be limited to consumption outlays. The Reagan administration floated the idea in 1986, and the Clinton administration created a commission to study it.
A common criticism has always been that the definition of "capital" is too slippery and could too easily become a loophole through which consumption spending could escape. The obvious answer is to assign some entity, like the Government Accountability Office, to audit investment spending and ensure that it truly represents investment and not consumption.
Many economists say they believe that the best thing the federal government can do to raise the long-term economic growth rate is increase infrastructure spending. It would have the double benefit of mobilizing idle resources, especially unemployed workers, while low interest rates permit capital projects to be financed very cheaply.
One main barrier to achieving this double benefit is the confusion between investment spending and consumption spending, which is distorted by the way the budget is presented and the way we calculate saving.

HEADLINE: Europe's Reaction to Italian Elections: 'Devastating' 'Chaos'

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The European press went into overdrive on Tuesday with a shocked response to the political gridlock in Italy and the potential spillover to the euro zone. Are the doom-mongers justified, or is the indecisive outcome just a historical blip? 

 BODY:
LONDON - Deadlock? Impasse? Stalemate? Take your pick.
The European press was united on Tuesday in its anguish over an indecisive election in Italy that commentators said threatened to make the country ungovernable. 
Germany's Der Spiegel said the only good news was that Silvio Berlusconi did not win.
"But the bad news is disturbing enough," according to Der Speigel's Hans-Jürgen Schlamp. "Center-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani was unable to win control of the Senate, meaning that a stable government in Italy looks unlikely.
"The results for Europe could be devastating."
Italy's European partners have more than a passing interest in the electoral gridlock. The political uncertainty puts new strains on the euro at a time when leaders had hoped the worst of the crisis in the currency zone was over.
Italian bonds fell on Tuesday as a period of instability threatened the euro zone's third largest economy.
"Italians choose a government of chaos!" declared Germany's Bild Zeitung and asked: "Will they now destroy our euro?"
"The Italian impasse revives the specter of the crisis," according to Les Echos, the French business daily, describing the election outcome as a worst-case scenario for investors.
The Open Europe think tank said on its blog that the final result looked like Brussels' and Berlin's worst nightmare.
It predicted there would be a lot of pressure to change Italian electoral law in the event of a re-run of the election. "For that, of course, you need a majority in both houses...," it added wistfully.
As my colleague Rachel Donadio reported from Rome, Italian voters delivered a rousing anti-austerity message and a strong rebuke to the existing political order in the national elections.
That included a massive turnout for the populist Five Star Movement of Beppe Grillo, a former stand-up comedian.
Most European commentators failed to see the joke. François Sergent at Libération, the left-leaning daily, wrote, however, that it was understandable that Italians should have rallied to this "sinister clown of the Republic" given their recent political history.
Conservative Home, a grassroots journal of the British Conservative Party, lamented that "the only grown-up candidate in the election" - Mario Monti, the technocrat prime minister - won just 10 percent of the vote.
Markets in Europe and beyond responded initially with predictable nervousness to the news from Italy.
But my colleague Roger Cohen offered a sober reminder that Italian elections have been even more serious affairs in the past. During the Cold War, they were watched with some foreboding from the U.S. embassy. 
"Italy was the soft underbelly of the West where the Communist Party might enter government," Roger writes. "It never did."
"By comparison, the Italian election unfolding as I write is a geostrategic minnow. Markets are worried, but then markets always are."

HEADLINE: Feeding Ourselves on a Warming Planet

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: A new working paper suggests that modest efforts to tackle climate change are not enough to protect the world&#8217;s food supply. 

 BODY:
As has often been noted here on the Green blog, one of the biggest uncertainties humanity faces regarding climate change is the potential effect on the world's food supply. 
If there is a risk that global warming and related changes could hit much sooner and much harder than scientists are expecting, agriculture could be the crucial realm where that occurs. In fact, we have already entered an era of sharply higher global food prices, with climate change as one of the likely causal factors.
A new paper from researchers associated with Tufts University puts the overall risk in perspective. It is billed as a working paper, meaning it has not gone through formal scientific review, but it strikes me as worth highlighting nevertheless. The findings pretty closely match the conclusions presented in some of my reporting from 2011.
The authors, Frank Ackerman and Elizabeth A. Stanton, point out that in the 1990s, research suggested that climate change would be fairly benign for agriculture. The first few degrees of warming would help agriculture expand in chilly regions, the thinking went, and the rising level of atmospheric carbon dioxide would act as plant fertilizer, increasing crop yields. More recent science has cast sharp doubt on some of those conclusions. 
Yet the earlier, rosy forecast is still incorporated into a lot of economic models of climate change. As a result, economists sometimes come to the conclusion that relatively modest efforts to tackle climate change are adequate for now.
"Can we muddle along without expensive climate initiatives, and go on living - and eating - as before?" the authors of the new paper ask. "Not for long, according to some of the new research on climate and agriculture."
I would say the research they cite, though clearly an improvement over the work from the 1990s, is by no means definitive; a major new program designed to improve predictions about climate and agriculture is still in its early phases. Anyway, what attempt to predict the future is ever definitive? 
But anybody who wants a tight synopsis - less than 20 pages - of the emerging indications that we are in trouble on the food supply could do worse than consulting this working paper. It recaps recent findings that the benefits on plant growth of rising carbon dioxide levels may not be as great as originally hoped, that temperature extremes resulting from climate change may have a severe effect on crop yields and that fresh water scarcity could exacerbate the problems.
"If warming continues unabated, it will, in a matter of decades, reach levels at which adaptation is no longer possible," the researchers conclude. "Any long-run solution must involve rapid reduction of emissions, to limit the future extent of climate change."

HEADLINE: A Musical Pitch to Albany to Raise Minimum Wage

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: In a video on YouTube, restaurant workers stacking dishes, shaking drinks, chopping onions and plating burritos take a moment to lip-sync and dance along to the 1959 Motown hit &#8220;Money (That&#8217;s What I Want).&#8221; 

 BODY:
[Video: Watch on Youtube.]
As the battle over whether to raise the minimum wage heats up in Albany, some laborers are pressing their case in a musical fashion.
In a new video on YouTube, restaurant workers stacking dishes, shaking drinks, chopping onions and plating burritos take a moment to lip-sync and dance along to the 1959 Motown hit "Money (That's What I Want)." 
What they want, more specifically, is a $9 minimum wage. That's what President Obama proposed in his State of the Union address that it be by the end of 2015, with earlier increases made in stages. His plan gave a push to Democrats in Albany who had initially wanted a wage of $8.50 (Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo last month called for an $8.75 minimum as of July).
The minimum in New York currently stands at $7.25, or about $14,500 a year for a 40-hour week and a 50-week year, and has not increased since 2009. Workers who receive tips have a base minimum of $5 an hour.
The video, created for the lobbying group Strong Economy for All and the worker-advocacy group Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, uses the original recording by Barrett Strong. Tim Murphy, one of the video's creators, said that permission was not sought and royalties were not paid for the use of the song and recording, but that it was for a noncommercial use.

HEADLINE: The Fever Swamp of the Center, Continued

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Desperately seeking sequester parity. 

 BODY:
I love Jonathan Chait's phrase "the fever swamp of the center"; it really is true that self-identified centrists are sounding crazier and crazier, as they try to reconcile their fanatical devotion to the proposition that both parties are equally at fault with the distressing reality that Obama actually advocates the policies they claim to want. And today's WaPo editorial on the sequester takes the fever to a new pitch. The editorial admits that Obama is calling for exactly the polices the WaPo wants, while Republicans are off the deep end in refusing to consider any revenue; but the piece is nonetheless written as a criticism of Obama, because 
Mr. Obama has presented entitlement reform as something he would do grudgingly, as a favor to the opposition, when he should be explaining to the American people - and to his party - why it is an urgent national need. 
Oh, Barack, you're telling me what I want to hear, but you don't sound as if you mean it! Is this policy analysis, or a lovers' quarrel?
Oh, and I can't help reacting to this:
Interest alone will have risen from $224 billion this year to an astonishing $857 billion 10 years from now, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Is $857 billion really astonishing? The American economy is huge, and interest costs are currently very low, so some perspective might be in order. Let's look at interest as a percentage of GDP:
So yes, interest payments are projected to rise, which is not great. But even a decade from now, they're expected to be no higher than they were when Bush the Elder was in the White House - not particularly astonishing in the aftermath of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s.
So it's all there: hyperventilating about the deficit, together with an absolute determination to blame both sides equally no matter how unbalanced they really are. And as Chait, Greg Sargent, and others say, this refusal to hold the worse parties accountable is in itself an important source of our political dysfunction.

HEADLINE: In Wall St. Tax, a Simple Idea but Unintended Consequences

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: A financial transaction tax seems to be a winner for everyone, but a century of experience with the tax suggests that it is not as successful as thought. 

 BODY:
Some say that a financial transaction tax is a cost-free way to kill many a bird with one stone - raising revenue, preventing financial crashes and making markets safer. But advocates of this neat idea conveniently ignore the century of less-than-successful experience with this tax, including New York State's own failed attempt.
The idea behind a financial transaction tax, which is a tax on individual market trades, has a smart pedigree. John Maynard Keynes suggested it, and James Tobin, a Nobel laureate in economics, was its most famous modern advocate. Tobin, who died in 2002, wanted to "throw some sand in the wheels" of the markets, and his idea, endorsedby Joseph Stiglitz and Lawrence H. Summers among others, is based on an increasingly held belief that markets are far from efficient. Imposing a transaction tax on each individual trade would eliminate wasteful trading and reduce market volatility, ending short-term speculation and mispricing of assets.
This net benefit is paired with a simple budget argument. The Robin Hood Tax campaign in Britain, for example, has used the slogan "Not complicated. Just brilliant" to support a 0.05 percent tax on transactions as an effective way to ease the budget without harming markets. Let's face it, the banks are an easy target after the financial crisis. 
 It seems to be a win for everyone.
Unfortunately, the reality has been much different.
Let's start with New York State, which has had such a tax since 1905. Over the next eight decades, the tax was revised up and down nine times, including a large increase in the middle of the Great Depression. In 1966, Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York City ended up raising the tax by 25 percent. It led to an immediate reaction as the New York Stock Exchange threatened to jump across the Hudson River to New Jersey.
In the 1970s, the tax began to be phased out. New York State still collects the tax - some $14.5 billion annually - but since 1981, the state has simply returned it to traders instead of keeping it. In other words, the tax is collected and immediately given back, something that can happen only in the strange world of taxes. (Other financial transaction taxes include a federal version, which was put in effect in 1914 to help pay for World War I and eliminated in 1966, and taxes in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania that were also done away with in the 1950s.)
A study of New York State's tax from 1932 to 1981 by Anna Pomeranets and Daniel G. Weaver found that it increased the cost of capital for investors and reduced trading volume. Most important, they found the tax actually increased trading volatility by as much as 10 percent.
Increasing volatility is exactly what advocates of the tax don't want. They want volatility reduced to prevent market disruptions, but the decline in traders in the markets mean fewer buyers and sellers and more price jumps. This finding of increased volatility is in general accord with nine other major papers to study this issue, including studies of the tax in 23 countries, among them Britain, Sweden and Japan. Only one of these papers found that a financial transaction tax reduced volatility.
The New York State tax experience raises a bigger issue - that of traders just going elsewhere. This problem was mirrored in Sweden.
In 1984, Sweden adopted a financial transaction tax. Some 30 percent to 50 percent of the country's trading volume then shifted to Britain. The lower amount of trading meant that not only did the tax yield less money than predicted but that the country lost more in capital gains taxes than the financial transaction tax raised. The tax was abolished in 1991.
The Swedish and New York State examples show that not only will traders leave to trade elsewhere; the money that people think this tax will reap will not appear, as that trading migrates and volume declines. Japan decided to eliminate its financial transaction tax in 1999 for this reason.
And even if the trading does not shift to other places, financial people are adept at avoiding it. In Britain, for example, where the financial transaction tax has fluctuated from half a percent to 2 percent, the tax has raised significantly less revenue than one might expect, about £3 billion a year. The reason is that investors who trade regularly in Britain use options to avoid the tax, which applies only to trading in stock. The result may be that the tax pushes investors into more risky securities in their efforts to avoid it.
And the reduced volume does not just reduce the amount of revenue collected. It may impose the largest costs on people who cannot afford or avoid the tax. The money management firm BlackRock has calculatedthat if the financial transaction tax were set at 0.1 percent per trade, an investor putting $10,000 in its global equity fund would lose more than $2,300 in expected returns over a 10-year period. This amount would rise to $15,000 if the money were invested in a more actively managed European fund.
This means not only less in retirement funds, but fewer jobs. Although disputed, one study in 2004 by the Partnership for the City of New York found that if New York State started keeping a tax of 0.25 cents per share traded, it would lose 23,000 to 33,000 jobs for every 10 percent drop in volume and more than $3 billion in lost revenue and economic value, probably more than offsetting the amount it collected.
This is not to say that a financial transaction tax by itself is such a terrible idea. My point is that we already have lots of experience with this kind of tax, and it argues for caution. If you think a financial transaction tax will reduce volatility, then you have to account for the fact that taxes in the past have shown the opposite. And if the tax is not imposed globally, it will force migrations of trading to less regulated places and in more byzantine forms, possibly making the world markets less safe.
As for seeking revenue gains to solve budget problems, if the tax is too small, it will have no effect. But the larger it is - and the Robin Hood Foundation's proposal is in the large sphere - the more markets will be affected. It is for these reasons that Canada has rejected such a tax.
Now, we are about to get a real-life case study. France has adopted a 0.2 percent financial transaction tax involving securities of a company with a market capitalization of more than 1 billion euros. The full effects of France's tax are not yet known, but a preliminary study by Credit Suisse, according to The Economist, found that stocks not subject to a tax rose 19 percent by volume, but those affected by the tax declined 16 percent. And the net effect of the tax appears to have shifted trading to smaller stocks not subject to it, distorting the allocation of capital, which is another problem with the tax. And the European Union has proposed a tax for 11 of its member countries, giving us a possible second test.
Instead of rushing into the adoption of a financial transaction tax, it may behoove us to watch and see whether these new taxes in Europe work. And even if the United States plunges ahead, history tells us that any tax should be carefully structured and considered before being put into effect. For there are likely to be many unintended consequences. There's a reason that economists say there is no free lunch.
An earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to the time period covered in a study by Anna Pomeranets and Daniel G. Weaver of New York State's experience with such a tax. It was from 1932 to 1981, not "eight decades."

HEADLINE: Toward a Republican Synthesis

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: How to integrate the Tea Party era with the policy turn the G.O.P. needs to make. 

 BODY:
I've been reading with interest the discussion the Claremont Review of Books is hosting on moderation, conservatism, and the Republican Party, which opens outward from William Voegeli's review of Geoffrey Kabaservice's recent history of moderate Republicanism, "Rule and Ruin," and then loops in Steven Hayward and David Frum as well as Voegeli and Kabaservice for a wide-ranging conversation. This discussion is brought to a point in Voegeli's concluding back-and-forth with Frum, which provides a neat capsule summary of two very different ways of thinking about the Tea Party/Ryan budget era in Republican politics, and how the G.O.P. candidates of 2014 and 2016 should approach their task. First, Voegeli: 
... the Republican Party already has a substantively admirable agenda that, if implemented, would point America in the right direction. The Paul Ryan fiscal framework, which House Republicans overwhelmingly endorsed and which Kabaservice and Frum have criticized, will suffice as a shorthand version of that agenda. I take its essential feature to be that federal spending on entitlement and discretionary domestic programs, which has grown steadily as a proportion of our growing economy for the past eight decades, should account for a declining proportion of a growing economy over coming decades. America, that is, will bend its domestic spending curve downward until it comports with revenues from a tax system no more burdensome than the historic average. An important vehicle for realizing that change will be to means-test and voucherize entitlement programs.
The belief in the wisdom of the Ryan fiscal framework and Tea Party challenge to liberalism implies two things. First, and more hopefully, it suggests that better arguments and advocates could secure better electoral results than they have so far ...
... The other, more discouraging possibility is that Ryan's fiscal framework is wise policy that will never be good politics, no matter how persuasively it is explained ... [because] persuading Americans to demand and accept less from government ... may be a political Mission Impossible.
And Frum, in response:
As mentioned, post-2008 hard-right conservatives did rally around one new idea: the Ryan plan praised above by William Voegeli. And what was the Ryan plan? Simply this: a plan to load almost all the burden of fiscal adjustment onto Americans under age 55, while largely exempting Americans over age 55 ... Once you begin to think of the Tea Party as a vehicle for advancing the economic interests of the old against the young ... a lot of otherwise mysterious behaviors suddenly begin to make sense.
But that is a lesser point. The more important point is: Times change. Conditions change. Problems change ... Within the context of our present politics-a politics in which market-minded people have won, not lost, most of the major arguments since 1975-we need a party of the center-right that can advocate private initiative, reasonable taxation, and sustainable government in ways that make sense to contemporary voters: without despair, without rage, without resentment, and without reliance on pseudo-facts and pretend information. We need a center-right that does not blame the voters for its own mistakes of head and heart. We need a center-right that is culturally modern, environmentally responsible, and economically inclusive. There's the "finale" we should be seeking after the broken crockery from the Tea Party tantrum is cleared away.
Now these seem like nearly-irreconcilable positions - either the last few years have been a "tantrum" to be transcended, or a fertile period that's produced a "substantively admirable agenda" that may only await the right salesman to be implemented. But I actually think that they need to be reconciled - and more, that the Republican Party cannot escape its current predicament unless leaders emerge who are capable of reconciling them.
Such a reconciliation might run as follows: For both practical and political reasons, it was necessary and important for the post-Bush Republican Party to become more serious about long-term deficits than the party was in the flush years of dot-com surpluses and the emergency years that followed 9/11. The projected growth of Medicare and (to a lesser extent) Social Security are threats to both American solvency and conservative principle, and absent a commitment to entitlement reform, there can be no fiscal conservatism worthy of the name.
Seen in this light, the fact that the party is now generally united behind a premium-support reform to Medicare is not a small thing or a pointless detour, but a major breakthrough for sound right-of-center policymaking - and one that wouldn't have been possible absent Tea Party zeal and Paul Ryan's efforts to direct that zeal into constructive projects. Of course those projects were compromised in various ways by cynicism and generational pandering, but the Republicans could have just as easily opted for cynicism all the way down, hammering the Obama White House's Medicare cuts without adopting any entitlement reform proposals of their own. The fact that they chose substance instead - rallying around first the Ryan plan and then its more plausible Ryan-Wyden variation - is a good thing, a necessary thing, and a step that was to crucial to conservative credibility in spending debates to come.
But - and here comes the pivot from Voegeli to Frum -what was necessary is not sufficient. The Republican Party needs a plan to prevent entitlements from swallowing the American economy, but the evidence of 2012 suggests that it also needs what any successful political party tends to need - namely, realistic policy responses to the problems that loom largest in Americans' everyday lives right now. These responses should be consonant with limited-government conservatism, and compatible with the attempt to keep public spending from growing at its current pace. But the problems such policies should be intended to solve are not the same as the problem that entitlement reform is designed to solve, and a successful Republican Party would show signs of understanding that distinction. There's more to public policy than fiscal roadmaps, and it should be possible to correct America's fiscal course while also displaying policy imagination on questions like work-life balance, health care access and affordability, the cost of college, social mobility, and so forth.
Republicans need some version of Frum's modernization, in other words, not as an alternative to Voegeli's broad commitment to keeping government within its historic limits, but as a complement to that commitment. And the two visions really can be complementary. Absent entitlement reform, there will be no money left for the "limited but active" government favored by many moderate Republicans to do anything except pay retirees' health care bill. Absent a policy agenda more capacious and responsive than entitlement reform alone, there will be no Republican majority capable of implementing any sort of Medicare overhaul whatsoever. What's needed is not an all-out conflict between the two visions of the G.O.P. future, but a synthesis that furthers both.

HEADLINE: House Republican Expresses Support for Guest-Worker Program

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Robert Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he could support a measure that would offer at least temporary legalization for illegal immigrants who are currently in the country working in agriculture. 

 BODY:
Representative Robert Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, appeared willing to carve out a sliver of middle ground on Tuesday in the debate over the future of the nation's immigration system, offering up the possibility of a guest worker program as a trial case for how the country handles both legal and illegal immigration.
At a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the topic of agricultural workers, Mr. Goodlatte, the chairman of the full committee, said that he could support a measure that would offer at least temporary legalization for illegal immigrants who are currently in the country working in the agriculture industry. 
"A guest worker program should help farmers who are willing to pay a fair wage for law-abiding, dependable workers - not punish them," Mr. Goodlatte said. "And for this reason I support replacing the H-2A program and implementing new policies that will bring our illegal agricultural workers out of the shadows, as a first step in the process of overhauling our nation's immigration system." 
An H-2A visa allows workers into the country to perform temporary or seasonal agricultural work. As Mr. Goodlatte acknowledged, the vast majority of farmworkers in the United States - as much as 70 percent of the farm labor force, according to growers' groups - are immigrants here illegally.
Mr. Goodlatte, a former immigration lawyer, has previously taken a hardline stance on an immigration overhaul, opposing a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally. But he has also said he is open to finding some middle ground between deportation and full citizenship.
The agriculture guest worker program, he implied on Tuesday, could be a first step.
"Addressing the complex labor issues of the relatively small agriculture sector can help us understand how we can build our broader immigration laws and enforcement mechanisms in order to enhance the U.S. economy and make our immigration laws more efficient and fair for all involved," he said.
Visas for lower-skilled workers have proved a divisive issue in past immigration debates, pitting the business community - which favors allowing guest workers into the country to help employers fulfill their labor needs - against the labor community, which worries that immigrant workers could depress wages and take away jobs from Americans. But last week, labor and business groups jointly called for a visa system that would meet labor market demands while protecting American workers.
The tone of Tuesday's subcommittee hearing was far less heated than a full-committee hearing on broad immigration proposals earlier this month, and several members expressed optimism that, at least on this topic, an agreement could be reached.
Still, some House Republicans remained hesitant about the logistics of reforming the temporary worker program. Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, said that a "true" guest worker program would have to be a "short" guest worker program, seeming to rule out the possibility of any form of legalization for the workers. And Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, suggested a program that would "bond" workers; employers, he explained, would be forced to post a bond of sorts - much like the bond system in criminal court - to ensure that their workers would ultimately return home.
"I'm going to guess from the look on your face that you haven't discussed that," Mr. King said, shortly after making the suggestion.
On Wednesday, the subcommittee is set to look at the record of the E-Verify program, the current tool to help employers determine the legal status of newly hired workers.

HEADLINE: Only Half of First-Time College Students Graduate in 6 Years

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center looks at six-year graduation rates for first-time college students who enrolled in fall 2006. 

 BODY:
As we've covered here many times before, there is an abundance of evidence showing that going to college is worth it. But that's really only true if you go to college and then graduate, and the United States is doing a terrible job of helping enrolled college students complete their educations. 
A new report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center digs deeper into these graduation rates. It finds that of the 1.9 million students enrolled for the first time in all degree-granting institutions in fall 2006, just over half of them (54.1 percent) had graduated within six years. Another 16.1 percent were still enrolled in some sort of postsecondary program after six years, and 29.8 percent had dropped out altogether. 
As you can see, many of the students who ultimately graduated did so at a different institution than the one where they had originally enrolled. Of the whole cohort of 2006 matriculants, 42 percent graduated where they had first enrolled, and another 9.1 percent graduated from a place to which they had transferred.
The graduation and transfer rates varied greatly by state, and by the type of institution in which the student first enrolled. In Minnesota, for example, 27 percent of students who enrolled at four-year public institutions graduated at a different school within six years. That was the highest share for any state in this metric.
A small share of students (3.2 percent) who started out at four-year schools ended up receiving their first degree or certificate instead from a two-year school, with rates above 5 percent in Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin. On the other hand, 9.4 percent of all students who initially enrolled at a two-year public institution received their first degree at a four-year school.
The report also looked at the state-level completion rates for students who are "traditional" (that is, age 24 and younger) versus "nontraditional" or "adult" (over age 24).
Not surprisingly, in almost every state, traditional-age students starting at public four-year schools had higher completion rates than nontraditional-age students. The smallest gap was in Arizona (1 percentage point, 68.4 percent of traditional students graduating versus 67.6 percent of adult students) and the highest was in Vermont (42 percentage points, 74.3 percent versus 32.2 percent).

HEADLINE: Bernanke: By Unemployment, Not So Good

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The Fed chairman&#8217;s tenure has produced low inflation and high unemployment. But the credit or blame may lie elsewhere. 

 BODY:
As Catherine Rampell notes, Ben S. Bernanke pointed to the low inflation in his tenure in Senate testimony on Friday. Inflation has been lower during his tenure than during that of any postwar Fed chairman. But the Fed has a dual mandate: 
"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
That mandate was established in 1977, but we took all postwar Fed chairmen and ranked them by average unemployment rate during their tenure. Mr. Bernanke has the second-worst record: 
Paul Volcker, 7.7%
Ben S. Bernanke, 7.3%
Arthur Burns, 6.3%
G. William Miller, 5.9%
Alan Greenspan, 5.5%
Thomas McCabe, 5.0%
William McC. Martin, 4.6%
If his term ended now, the rate would also have gone up more in his tenure than during any previous chairman since World War II.
All this means very little in determining how good a job Mr. Bernanke has done. He, along with others, deserves credit for keeping the Great Recession from being even worse than it was. The weak world economy had a lot to do with keeping inflation low and unemployment high. He does not deserve credit for the first, or blame for the latter.

HEADLINE: Dependents of the State

BYLINE: AMIA SRINIVASAN


HIGHLIGHT: Why do we loathe and fear some people&#8217;s reliance on the government but not others? 

 BODY:
Of all the sins to which an American can succumb, the worst may be dependence on the state.
Think back for a moment to the two biggest missteps in the 2012 presidential election: Mitt Romney's dismissal of the "47 percent" of people "dependent on the government," and President Obama's "you didn't build that," intended to remind American business owners that their success wasn't all due to smarts and hard work, but also to the roads and bridges built by others, the government-sponsored research that produced the Internet and the "unbelievable American system we have that allowed you to thrive." Both statements came off as stinging insults directed at large groups of voters, and both were seen as tactical disasters. 
Conservatives champion an ethos of hard work and self-reliance, and insist - heroically ignoring the evidence - that people's life chances are determined by the exercise of those virtues. Liberals, meanwhile, counter the accusation that their policies encourage dependence by calling the social welfare system a "safety net," there only to provide a "leg up" to people who have "fallen on hard times." Unlike gay marriage or abortion, issues that divide left from right, everyone, no matter where they lie on the American political spectrum, loathes and fears state dependence. If dependence isn't a moral failing to be punished, it's an addictive substance off which people must be weaned.
Like so many politically important notions, the concept of "state dependence" purports to do no more than describe the way things are, but contains within it a powerful and suspect moral judgment. What is it for one thing to depend on another? Put most simply, X depends on Y when it's the case that X wouldn't exist if Y didn't exist. More subtly, X depends on Y when it's the case that X wouldn't be in the state it is in without Y's being in the state it is in. Americans who collect food stamps, Medicaid, unemployment insurance or welfare checks are said to be dependent on the state because the lives they lead would be different (indeed, worse) if the state did not provide these services - at least without their working harder and longer. Despite the symbolic resonance of Ronald Reagan's fictitious "welfare queen," most of the people who rely on means-tested social services either cannot work, have been recently laid off thanks to the economic downturn, or are already working in poorly paid, immiserating jobs. Of the 32 million American children currently being raised in low-income families - families who cannot afford to meet their basic needs - nearly half have parents who are in full-time, year-round jobs.
But if the poor are dependent on the state, so, too, are America's rich. The extraordinary accumulation of wealth enjoyed by the socioeconomic elite - in 2007, the richest 1 percent of Americans accounted for about 24 percent of all income - simply wouldn't be possible if the United States weren't organized as it is. Just about every aspect of America's economic and legal infrastructure - the laissez-faire governance of the markets; a convoluted tax structure that has hedge fund managers paying less than their office cleaners; the promise of state intervention when banks go belly-up; the legal protections afforded to corporations as if they were people; the enormous subsidies given to corporations (in total, about 50 percent more than social services spending); electoral funding practices that allow the wealthy to buy influence in government - allows the rich to stay rich and get richer. In primitive societies, people can accumulate only as much stuff as they can physically gather and hold on to. It's only in "advanced" societies that the state provides the means to socioeconomic domination by a tiny minority. "The poverty of our century is unlike that of any other," the writer John Berger said about the 20th century, though he might equally have said it of this one: "It is not, as poverty was before, the result of natural scarcity, but of a set of priorities imposed upon the rest of the world by the rich."
The irony isn't only that the poor are condemned for being dependent on the state while the rich are not. It's also that the rich get so much more out of their dependence on the state than the poor. Without the support of the state, poor people's quality of life would certainly drop, but only by degrees: their lives would go from bad to worse. Take the state's assistance away from the rich, however, and their lives would take a serious plunge in comfort. No wonder rich people are on the whole conservative: the most ferocious defenders of the status quo are usually those who are most dependent on the system.
So, the question should not be why Americans loathe and fear dependence on the state, but rather: why do Americans loathe and fear some forms of state dependence but not others? Why is state dependence condemned when evinced by the poor, but tolerated, even unrecognized, when enjoyed by the rich? What justifies this double standard?
Here's one possible answer. While the rich are dependent on the state, the state is in turn dependent on them. The elite might enjoy levels of comfort and prosperity that the majority can scarcely imagine, but it's no more than they deserve: they are, after all, the "job creators," the engines of economic growth. The poor, by contrast, are just a drag on the system.
Even if it were granted that some sort of market-driven economy is in the public interest (or, to adapt Churchill's quip about democracy, that it is the worst option except for all the rest), the case would remain to be made that the sort of market-driven economy we have in the United States serves that interest. Indeed, this case would be especially difficult to argue at a time when we are living with the effects of an economic recession caused by the wealthiest among us, the cost of which is being paid largely by the poor and middle classes - in the loss of their homes and jobs, but also in the form of tax-dollar-driven bank bailouts. The orthodoxy is that inequality is the necessary price of economic growth, but research strongly suggests that inequality of income causes economic instability and slows overall growth, and that the rapid rise in inequality in the last few decades is to blame for the current economic recession.
The case for our current arrangements is still harder to make once one acknowledges the argument, put forward by Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, that economic inequality has a negative multiplier effect, making poor people in very unequal societies like the United State worse off - in terms of mortality, education, imprisonment rates, social mobility and so on - than they would be in more equal societies, even if they were just as poor. In other words, when the rich get richer, it doesn't just make them better off: it makes everyone else worse off.
Neither will it help anyone trying to make the case for the American way to compare the United States with other developed nations, where the average citizen is healthier, happier, better educated and enjoys more social mobility. Here we have a real-life chance to apply the political philosopher John Rawls's test for a just society, what he called the "veil of ignorance." If you didn't know what kind of person you were going to be - your gender, family circumstances, ethnicity - which of the developed nations would you choose to be born into? Would you be hoping to have a home, a job and good medical care? Would you like to be able to clothe, feed and educate your children someday? In that case you'd be foolish to pick the United States. You'd be better off choosing Norway, or any one of a number of countries that have better evened the balance between rich and poor state dependence with higher taxes and greater investment in social services.
Here's another answer one might give when asked why we should tolerate state dependence on the part of the rich, but not of the poor: the rich earn the benefits they accrue from the state, while the poor get something for nothing. Sure, the rich might have needed the state's help to get rich, but they have also had to work for their success; the poor can just sit back and wait for the welfare check to arrive. But this is to ignore the fact that most rich Americans didn't earn their wealth: they were given it, either directly through inheritance from their parents, or only slightly less directly through their access to elite secondary and higher education. Despite the sustaining myth of American meritocracy, one of the most significant determinants of where a child will end up on the socioeconomic ladder is which rung his or her parents occupied. (This reminds me of a story I heard from a fellow philosopher, Jason Stanley, about a guy he met in a bar, who explained that he had lost his job in the economic downturn, but that he had pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and re-launched his career as an entrepreneur. If he could do it, he said, anyone could. It turned out that he got his start-up capital from his father, a venture capitalist.) While middle-class and rich children no doubt have to burn the midnight oil to get into Harvard and Yale, they mostly end up at those places because of the huge advantages that wealth confers in the context of a failing public education system. Liberals and conservatives alike pin their hopes on education as the "great leveler," but the data tells us that the American education system magnifies the advantages of wealth and the disadvantages of poverty. The unearned advantages enjoyed by the children of rich parents dwarf the sums given to welfare recipients.
To claim that the rich earn what they have also ignores the fact that most of the people who depend on social services do work - only they work for their poverty rather than their wealth. Many of them depend on the state because the jobs available to them - the ones produced by the much-vaunted job creators - don't pay enough to allow them to live. Thus welfare payments to the poor effectively operate as yet another kind of corporate subsidy, making up for the difference between the increasing cost of living and declining real wages. California taxpayers alone pay $86 million dollars annually to subsidize Walmart via state assistance to its employees and their children.
America's socioeconomic elite has been successful in part because it has been allowed to get away with the argument that its success has nothing to do with the state: with a little elbow grease, the rich seem to say, the poor can be just like them. And the poor may all be too ready to agree. "Socialism never took root in America," John Steinbeck said, "because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires." It's a myth dear to the American psyche, the myth that Obama tried to pierce when he insisted that "you didn't build that." And while Obama might have retained the presidency, Romney and his ideological comrades have won, it seems, the long fight against "state dependence." 
The tax bill passed by Congress just in time to avert the "fiscal cliff," making the Bush tax cuts permanent for households under the $450,000 threshold, will cost the government $3.6 trillion over the next decade, as compared with the $4.5 trillion it would have cost if the Bush tax cuts had stayed in place. That isn't a lot in savings - and isn't enough to allow the government to continue funding social services at current levels. In the short term, America's rich, those earning above $450,000, will see their tax bills increase. But in the long term, it's America's poor who will be paying. Under the terms of the latest deal, the poor will enjoy a temporary extension on refundable tax credits; at the same time, the Bush-era estate tax cut, which will cost about $375 billion over the next decade as compared with the Clinton-era estate tax policy and will benefit only millionaires and their children, was made permanent. Now the once unthinkable sequester will almost surely go into effect on March 1, bringing $85 billion in budget cuts. The Democrats are scrambling to replace some of the most drastic of those spending cuts - to primary and secondary education, vaccination programs, medical research and environmental protection - with increased taxes on the rich, but the Republicans aren't budging. The sequester will almost certainly come into force by the end of this week, and is estimated to cost 700,000 jobs. Meanwhile, of the 47 percent that Romney lambasted for not paying taxes and scrounging off the state, 7,000 are millionaires.
We are all dependents of the state, not just the poor, and it's certainly not the poor who benefit most from their dependence. The question isn't who is dependent on the state, but whether the current political settlement treats everyone with fairness and dignity: whether the odds are stacked in particular people's favor, whether some are able to prosper only at the expense of others, whether everyone has an equal opportunity to make a decent human life. That we may not like the answers to these questions is the very reason we should ask them.

An earlier version of this post misstated the estimated number of jobs that will be lost due to the sequester. It is 700,000, not 70,000.

HEADLINE: Rivalries Begin to Emerge In a New Seat of Power

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Home to Apple, Google and other high-tech pioneers, the 17th Congressional District here recorded a political first in last fall's elections, becoming the first majority Asian-American district in the mainland United States.
At the same time, voters sent candidates of Asian descent to the Legislature and to local city councils like the one here, where Asian-Americans account for 63 percent of the population.
The Congressional seat itself was easily retained by Michael M. Honda, a Democrat first elected in 2000 and one of the most influential Asian-Americans in Congress. A Japanese-American whose views on politics and civil rights were shaped by his internment during World War II, Mr. Honda, 71, helped build a network for Asian-American political aspirants here and served as a mentor to many.
But a possible challenge to Mr. Honda in 2014 -- coming from Ro Khanna, 36, an Indian-American lawyer who served as a deputy assistant secretary in the Commerce Department and is a rising star in the Democratic Party -- has already set off intense maneuvering inside the district. Even as Asian-Americans represent the nation's fastest growing racial group, the attention focused on this potential contest underscores the diversity, and possibly emerging rivalries, among different Asian groups. 
Mr. Khanna said he has yet to decide whether to run. Mr. Honda, perhaps in one of the earliest moves to fend off a potential challenge next year, recently secured the endorsements of President Obama, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and other Democrats. The possible face-off has put many Asian-Americans here, especially Indian-Americans, in an awkward situation.
''I really appreciate what the congressman has done for the Asian-American community, and I have worked closely with him,'' said Kamil Hasan, an Indian-American who has long been involved in the tech industry and the Democratic Party. ''Ro Khanna would be a very strong candidate in whichever district he runs. The Indian community has wanted him to run for office for a long time.''
Mr. Hasan, who said he would not take a position until Mr. Khanna decided whether to run, has held fund-raisers for both Mr. Honda and Mr. Khanna.
California's system of nonpartisan redistricting created the 17th Congressional District, where Asian-Americans total 51 percent of the population. Asian-American politicians and activists had long sought such a district from which to build power nationally.
Although the district includes parts of San Jose, suburbs like Cupertino, Milpitas and Fremont have the highest concentration of Asian-Americans, especially the most recent waves of immigrants, said James S. Lai, the director of ethnic studies at Santa Clara University. Institutions like the Silicon Valley Asian Pacific American Democratic Club remain under the leadership of more established groups like Japanese-Americans and Chinese-Americans. The San Jose airport, for example, is named after Norman Y. Mineta, the Japanese-American politician.
But newer Asian-American groups have begun exerting influence. Democrats and Republicans have especially courted Indian-Americans, many of whom work in Silicon Valley and have proved formidable fund-raisers.
''The question is what Asian Indians feel ideologically aligned with,'' Mr. Lai said. ''This election could be an example of whether Asian Indians see themselves along the lines of pan-Asian, progressive politics that are part of what Mike Honda stands for, or whether they will they go for his challenger's politics, which are more conservative and pro-business.''
A teacher, Mr. Honda got his political start in 1971 when Mr. Mineta, as mayor of San Jose, appointed him to the planning commission. Mr. Honda rose steadily -- from the school board to the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors to the State Assembly -- before being elected to Congress in 2000 in a district that had been represented by Mr. Mineta.
Ami Bera, an Indian-American physician elected to Congress last fall in a district near Sacramento, said he approached Mr. Honda for advice four years ago when he was considering running. Speaking after a panel on Asian-Americans and politics with Mr. Honda here recently, Mr. Bera said of the Asian-Americans serving in the House, ''Each of us has our own unique story of how Mike took us under his wing, mentored us and then was out there probably the most active of any member of Congress helping us getting elected.''
Mr. Khanna has been laying the groundwork for a possible campaign by meeting influential people in the district and writing op-ed articles on subjects that resonate here, like American relations with Asia and manufacturing. Under California's top-two primary system, Mr. Khanna and Mr. Honda, both Democrats, could end up facing each other in a general election.
In a Democratic primary a decade ago, Mr. Khanna unsuccessfully challenged Representative Tom Lantos in a district north of here. He drew attention last year by easily raising $1.2 million for an exploratory committee seeking an unspecified seat; he considered challenging Representative Pete Stark, a longtime Democratic incumbent in the East Bay who was defeated last fall by a young Democrat, Eric Swalwell.
In a district that is heavily Democratic but includes a large percentage of undeclared voters, Mr. Khanna could try to woo moderate Democrats from Mr. Honda, who has a liberal voting record and favors higher taxes.
In an interview, Mr. Khanna said he favored ''a pro-economic growth agenda.'' The district's majority Asian-American status, he said, ''can be a huge asset to our nation in figuring out the right policies for global competitiveness.''
His economic message draws favorable comments from some Democrats, though none are willing to say so publicly for fear of offending Mr. Honda. Mayor Jose Esteves of Milpitas, a Republican and Filipino-American, recently endorsed Mr. Khanna and has been gathering support for him among other Filipino-Americans.
''Ro is more focused on Silicon Valley,'' Mr. Esteves said.
In an interview, Mr. Honda, who previously helped Mr. Khanna with fund-raising, brushed off the potential challenge. Competition among Asian-Americans, he said, is a sign of political maturity. ''Whites get challenged by whites -- how's that different?'' Mr. Honda said. ''When a community gets more diverse, you're going to run into that.''
But some of his closest allies have reacted angrily.
''We could have gotten behind Ro if he ran against Stark, but he's going against our leader,'' said Paul Fong, a Chinese-American assemblyman from here. ''Mike is the leader of the Asian Pacific Islander movement.''
A run by Mr. Khanna against an established figure twice his age could be regarded both negatively and positively in the district, said Madison Nguyen, the vice mayor of San Jose and a Vietnamese-American.
''Speaking from an Asian perspective, it could be seen as a sign of disrespect,'' she said, adding, however, that Silicon Valley's culture of risk-taking offered a counterbalance. ''When is the right timing to run for public office? Are you going to sit and wait for someone to retire?''

HEADLINE: As Budget Cuts Loom, Austerity Has Killed Off Government Jobs

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The federal government, the nation's largest consumer and investor, is cutting back at a pace exceeded in the last half-century only by the military demobilizations after the Vietnam War and the cold war.
And the turn toward austerity is set to accelerate on Friday if the mandatory federal spending cuts known as sequestration start to take effect as scheduled. Those cuts would join an earlier round of deficit reduction measures passed in 2011 and the wind-down of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that already have reduced the federal government's contribution to the nation's gross domestic product by almost 7 percent in the last two years. 
The cuts may be felt more deeply because state and local governments -- which expanded rapidly during earlier rounds of federal reductions in the 1970s and the 1990s, offsetting much of the impact -- have also been cutting back.
Federal, state and local governments now employ 500,000 fewer workers than they did on the eve of the recession in 2007, the longest and deepest decline in total government employment since the aftermath of World War II.
Total government spending continues to increase, but those broader figures include benefit programs like Social Security. Government purchases and investments expand the nation's economy, just as private sector transactions do, while benefit programs move money from one group of people to another without directly expanding economic activity.
The Federal Reserve and other economic forecasters say that the latest round of government austerity is not likely to return the economy to recession, thanks to stronger private sector growth. But the spending cutbacks and actions to raise taxes could reduce growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, leaving the sluggish economy operating well below capacity.
In testimony to lawmakers on Tuesday, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, urged Congress and the Obama administration to replace the scheduled budget cuts with a plan to reduce federal deficits more gradually.
''Although monetary policy is working to promote a more robust recovery, it cannot carry the entire burden of ensuring a speedier return to economic health,'' Mr. Bernanke said. He warned that the combination of previous spending cuts and the looming mandatory reductions ''could create a significant headwind for the economic recovery.''
The shrinking government is a normal response to an extraordinary situation. Government spending generally rises during recessions and falls as the economy recovers. Spending always declines at the end of one war, let alone two. And three years after a recession, the American economy typically is restored to full bloom.
But this time is different. Growth has remained sluggish and millions remain unemployed even as the federal government, riven by partisan differences, has largely turned its attention to deficit reduction.
Mr. Bernanke, like many critics of sequestration, said the government could not ignore the need to reduce its annual deficits and curtail the growth of its debt. But he said short-term cuts would worsen those problems by slowing the economy. Moreover, sequestration mostly spares Medicare and Medicaid, the health care programs that are the primary reason federal spending is projected to increase.
Congress and the administration, he said, should ''introduce these cuts more gradually and compensate with larger and more sustained cuts in the future.''
Others, however, say that it makes no sense to postpone inevitable cuts. They note that government cutbacks may cause short-term pain, but also tend to provide long-term benefits by making resources available to the private sector.
''People focus on the upfront cost and they don't think through the whole timeline,'' said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University and an occasional contributor to the Sunday Business section of The New York Times. ''You have to cut spending within the next 10 years anyway. It may be time to take some lumps.''
The current round of austerity does not yet approach the depth or the duration of the earlier round of cutbacks. Between 1969 and 1974, as spending on the Vietnam War declined, the government reduced consumption and investment by 24 percent after adjusting for inflation. Between 1991 and 1999, the government reduced consumption and investment by an inflation-adjusted 14 percent.
Over the last two years, federal consumption and investment declined by 6.9 percent. Including state and local consumption, a larger category that has declined more slowly, the inflation-adjusted reduction since 2011 was 4.9 percent.
But Alec Phillips, an economist at Goldman Sachs, estimated that federal consumption could fall by another 11 percent over the next two years. Mr. Phillips also noted that those earlier rounds of cuts in the 1970s and the 1990s came primarily from the military budget. The sequester is designed to be indiscriminate, cutting everything from air traffic control to nursery schools.
That could increase the resulting pain, because economic research suggests that military cuts are less painful than other kinds of spending reductions.
''It is cutting some of the best spending that government does,'' Professor Cowen said of the cuts that would fall on the domestic side of the ledger. He said Congress should focus instead on cuts to military spending, farm subsidies and health care programs like Medicare that he regarded as ripe for reductions.
He said that military contractors and personnel might be able to find new jobs with relative ease, because unemployment rates are fairly low for well-educated workers; it is those with less education who are struggling most.
An important reason for the depth of the current cutbacks is that the federal government mounted an unusually large response to the recession, even adjusting for its severity, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
Federal spending expanded to equal almost 25 percent of annual economic output in 2009, well above the 23 percent share that would have been expected based on past recessions, the San Francisco Fed found.
But that pattern has now flipped. While federal spending remained above the historical trend until earlier this year, scheduled cuts over the next two years would push government spending well below the trend.
''History shows that discretionary fiscal policy often helps to support a recovery,'' Janet Yellen, vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said in a recent speech. ''Discretionary fiscal policy this time has actually acted to restrain the recovery.''
She added: ''I expect that discretionary fiscal policy will continue to be a headwind for the recovery for some time, instead of the tail wind it has been in the past.''

MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY) (A16) CHARTS: Austerity Is Already Here: Federal government spending often falls after recessions and wars, but the current round of cuts in investment and spending on goods and services is unusually deep. Combined with cuts by state and local governments, the drop in government's contribution to economic growth is the largest in more than 50 years. Government jobs, which have generally increased during and after recessions, have declined 2.3 percent since the most recent one began in late 2007.

WASHINGTON
LAST month Emmanuel Saez, a celebrated economist at the University of California, Berkeley, issued another depressing report on income inequality. Among other things, Mr. Saez examined how real family incomes changed in the United States from 2009 to 2011, the first two years of the recovery. The richest 1 percent of Americans, he found, saw their incomes grow, on average, by more than 11 percent. As for the other 99 percent? You guessed it: incomes shrank by nearly half a percent.
The phenomenon is hardly new. The yawning gap between rich and poor has been growing since the 1970s and reached a 90-year peak in 2007, just before the financial crisis. The Great Recession narrowed the gap a bit, but now, once again, the richest Americans are vacuuming up what wealth is out there, a trend that Mr. Saez expects to continue. 
I am a capitalist and a lifelong Republican. I believe that, in a meritocracy, some level of income inequality is both inevitable and desirable, as encouragement to those who contribute most to our economic prosperity. But I fear that government actions, not merit, have fueled these extremes in income distribution through taxpayer bailouts, central-bank-engineered financial asset bubbles and unjustified tax breaks that favor the rich.
This is not a situation that any freethinking Republican should accept. Skewing income toward the upper, upper class hurts our economy because the rich tend to sit on their money -- unlike lower- and middle-income people, who spend a large share of their paychecks, and hence stimulate economic activity.
But more fundamentally, it cuts against everything our country and my party stand for. Government's role should not be to rig the game in favor of ''the haves'' but to make sure ''the have-nots'' are given a fair shot.
President Obama, who has rightly made income inequality a signature issue, cannot be pleased that the über-rich have gained under the policies pursued by his administration, while the bottom 99 percent have not. Unfortunately, his economic team, populated by acolytes of the former Treasury secretary Robert E. Rubin, has relied on the same ''growth'' policies that got us into trouble precrisis: generous treatment of the financial sector and easy money from the Federal Reserve. These strategies have done little to encourage sustainable economic growth, but they have worked wonders to increase Wall Street profits and inflate the value of stocks and bonds -- which are disproportionately owned by the rich.
Why haven't Republicans made an issue out of this? No doubt some fear that discussing it openly would catalyze support for redistributionist policies, which are anathema to a party that prides itself on increasing the pie, not redividing it. But there are other policy options to demonstrate Republicans' commitment to the average Joe and Jane that are very much in the party's tradition.
For instance, as part of renewed fiscal discussions over sequestration, Republicans should put fundamental tax reform on the table and make it our priority to end preferential treatment of investment income, which lets managers of hedge funds pay half the tax rate of managers of shoe stores.
Defenders of this giveaway make the unsubstantiated claim that it encourages job-creating investments. But what we have now is merely an immense pool of investment funds that has created far too few jobs. A report last year by Bain and Co. projected that by 2020 there will be $900 trillion in financial assets around the globe, chasing investments in a real economy worth only $90 trillion in gross domestic product. Why in heaven's name do we need to keep a tax preference to encourage more?
If we eliminate this and other unjustified tax breaks, we can produce enough new revenues to lower marginal rates and reduce the deficit, according to both the Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin debt-reduction plans.
Republicans should also put rebuilding the nation's transportation and energy infrastructure high on our political agenda. From Lincoln's transcontinental railroad to Eisenhower's highway system, Republicans have understood that investing in critical infrastructure projects creates jobs and expands commerce.
And given that the Federal Reserve insists on giving us cheap money, let's use it for the benefit of the country by issuing long-term debt to finance such projects and repay it over decades through dedicated taxes and user fees.
Some may say I am tilting at the windmills of Tea Party orthodoxy in making these suggestions, but I believe that most Republican politicians would be sympathetic to them, if only they could overcome their fear of primary challenges and the loss of Wall Street money. Having worked for Senate Republicans in the 1980s, I remember a time when Republicans stood up to special interests and purged the tax code of preferences for investment income and other special breaks.
They managed to survive re-election by showing leadership, taking principled positions and defending them vigorously. It's time for the Grand Old Party to return to those roots.

HEADLINE: Limiting Carbon Dioxide Pollution by Power Plants

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. BECKER and JAMES GERSTENZANG. 
Daniel F. Becker directs the Safe Climate Campaign. James Gerstenzang, the campaign's editorial director, covered the White House and the environment for The Los Angeles Times.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
ELECTRIC power plants spew about 40 percent of the carbon dioxide pollution in the United States, but, amazingly, there are no federal limits on utility emissions of this potent greenhouse gas. The Obama administration plans to remedy this situation by drafting rules that would curtail these discharges from existing plants. The president should make sure they are tough. Nothing he can do will cut greenhouse gases more.
By accomplishing this under the executive authority Congress granted him in the Clean Air Act, the president will be stepping in where recent Congresses have refused to go. He did the same thing last August, when he toughened auto emissions standards that will result in a new car fleet that averages 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, and again last spring, when he proposed rules, restricting carbon dioxide emissions, that will effectively prevent the building of new coal-burning power plants. 
Now President Obama should require existing power plants to reduce their emissions by at least one-quarter by 2020. These plants emitted 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2011, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, so a 25 percent cut would result in a reduction of more than 500 million tons. This would reduce lung-related illness and premature deaths, slow the accumulation of climate-changing gases in the atmosphere and demonstrate to the rest of the world that the United States was serious about taking on global warming.
To achieve these reductions, the rules should favor making homes, buildings and power plants more energy efficient over the more costly conversion of coal-fired plants to natural gas. (Gas-fired power plants emit half as much carbon dioxide as coal-fired plants. But expanding energy efficiency will reduce electricity demand and eliminate the need for the coal plants. Closing them is better than converting them to gas.) The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says the technology exists now to cut electricity use by one-quarter by 2020 through efficiency alone. Based on the average electricity production of the nation's large coal-fired power plants, this would allow for the closing of close to 60 such plants across the nation.
Certainly, the coal and utility industries won't take this lying down. Some coal mines may be closed, and the electric industry will be reconfigured. A study by the Natural Resources Defense Council estimated recently that reducing emissions by at least one-quarter over the next seven years would cost $4 billion in compliance expenses in 2020. But the reduced hospitalizations and fewer days of work lost to illness, and other health and environmental benefits would save $25 billion to $60 billion, the study said. The approach would also stimulate investments of more than $90 billion in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, according to the analysis for the N.R.D.C. by the consulting firm ICF International.
The progression to using less coal will create new jobs to build the highly efficient appliances, wind turbines, solar farms and other technologies that capture renewable energy. In addition, jobs will be created as some states and utilities choose to comply by building natural gas power plants, which should be done only if they won't cause environmental havoc.
The auto industry is beginning to show how strong emissions standards and the technological advances they stimulate can benefit employment. When the new rules were announced last summer, Bob King, president of the United Auto Workers, predicted that they would require ''more engineers and more factory workers, expanding employment in the industry.'' And Ford, which had already doubled its team working on fuel-saving engineering, said it planned to redouble the unit in 2015. Indeed, last week, Ford announced that it was adding 450 jobs at its Brook Park, Ohio, plant to produce its EcoBoost engine.
Not everyone will benefit immediately, of course. As demand for coal drops, some miners will lose their jobs. The nation owes them economic support, job training and sustainable jobs. There is a precedent for this: the government established a fund to help workers at nuclear weapons plants move to new jobs as the cold war ended.
But even as we reduce power plant pollution, we will need to do more to protect the atmosphere. We should also reduce emissions of such short-lived contributors to global warming as methane by tightening up leaky natural gas systems, and hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air-conditioning.
Ultimately, we must meet our energy needs largely without coal, oil or gas. We must use energy more efficiently to lower demand to the point that ramped-up clean, renewable energy supplies most of what we require.
By ordering the new auto emissions standards, Mr. Obama took an enormous step in the fight against global warming. In a similarly bold move, he can reduce our reliance on coal, a dirty fuel that is the greatest contributor to the nation's greenhouse gas pollution. By setting stringent power plant standards, he will slow global warming at a fraction of the cost of ignoring it.

HEADLINE: Report Shows Consumer Confidence Is Growing

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with automatic spending cuts looming, the outlook for the economy brightened a bit on Tuesday after reports showed that Americans were more confident and were buying more new homes. 
Home prices are also rising steadily, and banks are lending more. Such improvements suggest that the economy is resilient enough to withstand about $85 billion in government cuts that are expected to take effect on Friday.
''The stars are lining up for stronger private sector growth this year,'' said Craig Alexander, chief economist at TD Bank.
Sales of new homes jumped nearly 16 percent in January to their highest level in 4.5 years, adding momentum to the housing recovery. Consumer confidence rose in February after three months of declines. And home prices increased in December from the comparable month in 2011 by the largest amount in more than six years.
Over all, tax increases and spending cuts could shave up to 1.2 percentage points from growth this year, economists estimate. Mr. Alexander estimates that without the spending cuts or tax increases, the economy would expand more than 3 percent this year. Instead, he predicts growth of 2 percent.
But growth should accelerate later this year as the effects of the government cutbacks ease, he and other economists say. And several reports on Tuesday suggest that the economy's underlying health is improving despite the prospect of lower government spending and further budget stalemates.
The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 6.8 percent in December from a year earlier. That was the biggest year-over-year increase since July 2006. Rising home prices tend to make homeowners feel wealthier and encourage more spending. They also cause more people to buy before prices rise further. And banks are more likely to provide mortgages if they foresee higher home prices.
Sales of new homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 437,000, the Commerce Department said. Higher sales are keeping the supply of new homes low, even as builders have tried to keep up.
Consumer confidence rose after three months of declines, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Confidence had plunged in January after higher taxes cut most Americans' take-home pay. The rebound, though, suggests that some consumers have begun to adjust to smaller paychecks. The consumer confidence index rose to 69.6 in February from 58.4 in January, higher than last year's average of 67.1.
Bank lending rose 1.7 percent in the October-December quarter, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said. It was the sixth rise in seven quarters. Banks made more commercial and industrial loans to businesses and auto loans to consumers.
The F.D.I.C. also reported that profits at American banks jumped almost 37 percent for the October-December period, reaching the highest level for a fourth quarter in six years as lending increased.
Banks earned $34.7 billion in the last three months of 2012, up from $25.4 billion a year ago and the highest for a fourth quarter since 2006. Sixty percent of banks reported improved earnings from the fourth quarter of 2011, the agency said.
For all of 2012, the F.D.I.C. said bank earnings rose 19 percent to $141.3 billion, the second-highest annual level ever.

HEADLINE: Fed Defends Stimulus In Testimony to Senate

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, played down concerns about the Fed's economic stimulus campaign on Tuesday, describing it as necessary and effective and making clear it was likely to continue for some time.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Bernanke was relatively upbeat about the broader economy, which he said was growing again after pausing in the fourth quarter. But he said unemployment remained unacceptably high. 
''In the current economic environment, the benefits of asset purchases, and of policy accommodation more generally, are clear,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Monetary policy is providing important support to the recovery'' even as inflation remains in check.
The Fed, which has amassed almost $3 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to promote more borrowing and lending, is expanding those holdings by $85 billion a month until it sees clear improvement in the labor market. It plans to hold short-term interest rates near zero even longer, at least until the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent.
Other Fed officials unsettled some investors in recent weeks by raising concerns that the Fed was encouraging excessive risk-taking, or that it would be difficult to unwind the extensive purchases, which might lead the central bank to pull back. Mr. Bernanke's remarks appeared to soothe those concerns. Stocks rose as he spoke, and stayed up. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 0.61 percent on the day.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, wrote that the testimony amounted to a ''robust defense'' of the aggressive efforts by the Federal Open Market Committee that ''gives no ground to those within and without the F.O.M.C. who think asset purchases will soon need to be curtailed.''
The reception on Capitol Hill was frostier, as several Republican senators challenged Mr. Bernanke's assertion that the purchases were producing clear economic benefits, and questioned the potential costs. Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, drew Mr. Bernanke into an unusually sharp exchange.
Mr. Corker, asserting that low interest rates were ''throwing seniors under the bus,'' by reducing returns on some kinds of investments, asked Mr. Bernanke, ''Do you all ever talk about the longer-term degrading effect of these policies?''
''One thing we talk about is unemployment,'' Mr. Bernanke responded. He added that the best way to increase interest rates was to increase growth.
Mr. Corker then accused Mr. Bernanke of insufficient concern about potential inflation, saying, ''I don't think there's any question that you would be the biggest dove since World War II,'' using the term ''dove'' to denote a Fed official who is more concerned about unemployment than higher inflation.
Mr. Bernanke, clearly piqued, responded, ''You call me a dove, but my inflation record is the best of any chairman in the postwar period.''
The Fed chairman was more measured on the subject of asset bubbles.
Jeremy C. Stein, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, and some other Fed officials have expressed concern in recent months that low interest rates were encouraging excessive risk-taking by investors pursuing higher returns. Mr. Stein in a recent speech highlighted rising demand for junk bonds and certain kinds of real estate investments, and shifts in bank balance sheets, as areas of potential concern.
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed took these concerns ''very seriously,'' noting that the central bank had significantly expanded its efforts to monitor financial markets, as well as giving greater priority to financial regulation.
But he said that low interest rates also were helping to strengthen the financial system, by encouraging companies to increase reliance on long-term financing, allowing debt levels to decline and fostering growth.
He added that he saw no reason to consider a change in course.
''To this point we do not see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a stronger economic recovery and more rapid job creation,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
He also played down the concern expressed by some Fed officials and analysts that the central bank's plans to control inflation as the economy recovers could be complicated by a political penalty because it may lose money as it sheds some of its vast holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds.
Such losses could be large enough to prevent the Fed from transferring profits to the Treasury Department for the first time since 1934, according to a Fed analysis.
Mr. Bernanke, noting that the Fed had transferred $290 billion to Treasury since 2009, said it was ''highly likely'' Treasury still would see a net benefit from the purchases because any losses would not exceed those profits.
''Moreover,'' he said, ''to the extent that monetary policy promotes growth and job creation, the resulting reduction in the federal deficit would dwarf any variation in the Federal Reserve's remittances to the Treasury.''
Much of the hearing focused on fiscal policy as Mr. Bernanke renewed his warning that short-term spending cuts have become a major impediment to faster growth. He urged Congress to make cuts more gradually.
Several senators vainly pressed Mr. Bernanke to agree that the economic impact could be reduced by calibrating the cuts without altering the pace.
''The near-term effect on growth would not be substantially different,'' he said, although he eventually agreed that there might be modest benefits.
He even offered senators a little pep talk. ''I know that you're trying,'' he said, ''and I hope you can find the agreement to achieve these important objectives.''

HEADLINE: Is Mexico the Comeback Kid?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
MONTERREY, Mexico
Visiting Mexico this past week reminded me of one of my favorite quotes from my days in Beirut. It was when a hostess asked her dinner guests during the Lebanese civil war: ''Would you like to eat now or wait for the cease-fire?'' One of the lessons of both Mexico and Lebanon is how irrepressible is the human spirit -- that no matter how violent a country becomes, people will adapt and take risks to innovate or to make profits or get to school or to just have fun.
That is a key reason that Mexico is making something of a comeback these days. Whether it will make it back in a sustainable way is unclear. Mexico still has huge problems: stifling monopolies in energy, telecom and media; a weak K-12 education system; violent cartels; and a corrupt police and judiciary. Together, they will keep a lid on Mexico's prospects if they're not addressed, the human spirit notwithstanding. 
That said, it's useful to look at what Mexico has gotten right, despite its problems. The first two had to do with actions by the government -- improved higher education and macroeconomic policy. The third happened naturally. It's when a critical mass of youth ''just don't get the word'' -- they don't get the word that the government is a mess or that China is going to eat their lunch or that the streets are too dangerous. Instead, they take advantage of how the Internet and globalization promote individual empowerment and opportunities to start stuff and collaborate on stuff really cheaply -- and they just do it. Let's look at all three.
According to the Inter-American Development Bank: Despite Mexico's weakness in K-12 education, in the past 10 years, Mexico doubled its number of public education institutions at the postsecondary level, and many are dedicated to science and technology. It now graduates many more engineers. On Sept. 19, The Financial Times reported that ''according to Unesco, the number of engineers, architects and others in disciplines related to manufacturing graduating from Mexican universities has risen from almost 0.4 per 1,000 people in 1999 to more than 0.8 today. ... The number for the U.S. over the same period has remained roughly flat at 0.6 per 1,000.'' That is a reason that Mexico in 2012 became one of the largest exporters of information technology services in the world, approaching the likes of India, the Philippines and China.
As for economics, Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, summed it up in a Nov. 2 speech, when he said of Mexico: ''Between 1975 and 2000, there was one crisis after another: in 1976, 1982, 1985-88 and 1994.'' But thanks to a series of monetary and fiscal reforms, Fisher argued, the Mexican economy's vital signs look a lot healthier. ''The U.S. deficit is 7 percent of gross domestic product,'' said Fisher. ''Mexico's deficit is about 2 percent of their G.D.P.'' Meanwhile, he added, America ''is growing slowly, weighed down by debt and the pervasive uncertainty caused by our nation's fiscal imbalances and growing regulatory complexity. Mexico, in contrast, is growing robustly, and, in contrast to their Washington counterparts, Mexican policy makers are demonstrating remarkable commitment to fiscal discipline.''
As for Mexico's ''just do it'' generation, I'd put it this way: Monterrey has tens of thousands of poor living in shantytowns. They've been there for decades. What is new, though, is that this city, Mexico's Silicon Valley, now also has a critical mass of young, confident innovators trying to solve Mexico's problems, by leveraging technology and globalization.
I met a few of them: There was Raúl Maldonado, founder of Enova, which has created an after-school program of blended learning -- teacher plus Internet -- to teach math and reading to poor kids and computer literacy to adults. ''We've graduated 80,000 people in the last three years,'' he told me. ''We plan to start 700 centers in the next three years and reach six million people in the next five.'' There was Patricio Zambrano from Alivio Capital who has created a network of dental, optical and hearing aid clinics to provide low-cost alternatives for all three, plus loans for hospital care for people without insurance. There was Andres Muñoz Jr. from Energryn, who demonstrated his solar hot-water heater that also purified water and could cook meat. There was the administrator from Cedim, a start-up university offering a ''master's in business innovation.'' And there was Arturo Galván, founder of Naranya, a mobile Internet company that offers a range of services, including micropayments for consumers at the bottom of the pyramid.
''We've all been here for many years, but I think that the confidence is starting to happen,'' said Galván. ''You start to see the role models who started from zero and are now going public. We are pretty creative. We had to face a lot of challenges,'' As a result, he added, ''we are strong now, we believe, and the innovation ecosystem is happening.''
Naranya is based on the Spanish word for ''orange,'' or naranja. Why that name? I asked Galván. '' 'Apple' was already taken,'' he said.
My column on Sunday misstated how much the U.S. was spending in Afghanistan daily. It was about $300 million.

HEADLINE: Home Depot Share Rise as Profit Tops Forecasts

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Home Depot posted better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday, helped by a nascent recovery in housing and rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Sandy.
The company, the world's largest home improvement chain, also forecast higher sales and earnings per share for this fiscal year, an outlook analysts said might be conservative. Home Depot's shares gained 5.7 percent to close at $67.56 on Tuesday. 
For the 15th straight quarter, Home Depot also bested its rival, Lowe's, in sales at established stores. ''They are getting the assortment right,'' Robin M. Diedrich, an analyst at Edward Jones, said of merchandise in stores. ''This quarter is a kind of perfect example of that, where they really seemed to have gone after the holiday market, in a much bigger way than Lowe's did.''
Also on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes jumped 15.6 percent in January, to a four-and-a-half-year high, raising hopes for a housing recovery.
Home Depot said it expected overall sales to rise about 2 percent and sales at stores open at least 12 months to increase about 3 percent in the 2013 fiscal year, which began on Feb. 4. The company forecast earnings of $3.37 a share after stock repurchases, up about 12 percent from the previous year. That was below most forecasts.
Many Wall Street analysts, including Budd Bugatch at Raymond James and Ms. Diedrich, called the outlook conservative, citing recent improvements in the housing market and market share gains.
''We are not surprised that management remains a bit cautious given the uncertainty about the timing of the recovery in the economy and the housing market and its flow through to Home Depot,'' Mr. Bugatch said.
Wall Street's average estimate for the current fiscal year was for earnings of $3.49 a share.
New York and New Jersey were Home Depot's best-performing regions in the fourth quarter, which ended on Feb. 3, mainly because of repairs from Hurricane Sandy.
Net earnings rose to $1.0 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $774 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time gain, the company earned 67 cents a share, while analysts on average had expected a profit of 64 cents, Thomson Reuters said. Sales rose 13.9 percent, to $18.2 billion, beating the analysts' average estimate of $17.7 billion.
Home Depot, which is based in Atlanta, raised its quarterly dividend by 34 percent, to 39 cents a share, and approved a $17 billion stock repurchase.

HEADLINE: European Markets Dip Amid Uncertainty of Italian Election

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Stocks fell Tuesday across Europe and investors sold Italian bonds, a day after an inconclusive election in Italy raised fears that political deadlock there could hamper efforts to restore the economy and complicate the governance of the euro zone.
European leaders argued for calm, stressing that the political confusion would soon clear up and that negative market reaction would be short-lived as Italians and their European partners returned to the work of building greater integration. But they also stressed that the course of reform started under the current prime minister, Mario Monti, must be continued, for the good of the 17-nation euro zone. 
Results indicated that the center-left Democratic Party, led by Pier Luigi Bersani, would have a majority in the Lower House, thanks to the premium of bonus seats given to the largest bloc. But it would only have about 119 seats in the Senate, compared to 117 seats for the center-right People of Liberty party, led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- far short of the majority of 158 required to govern.
Mr. Berlusconi hinted that his party might be inclined to form a grand coalition with the Democratic Party, a prospect that would be ideologically incoherent but that experts said might be the only governing coalition possible, given the results.
Mr. Monti's party, which had helped restore investor confidence at the cost of unpopular spending cuts and tax increases, dropped into last place, behind the protest vote winner, the Five Star Movement of the former comedian Beppe Grillo. The result left the recession-weary nation with no clear path forward and the possibility that another round of elections might be necessary.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, fell 3.1 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London dipped 1.3 percent. The MIB stock index in Milan slid 4.9 percent.
Investors also dumped Italian debt. The yield on the 10-year sovereign bond, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose 40 basis points to almost 4.9 percent. Portuguese, Spanish and Greek bond prices also fell.
Bond yields have a direct effect on government financing costs, and it was the rise in Italian and Spanish government yields that led the European Central Bank to promise last July that it would do whatever necessary to save the euro. The Italian stalemate risks releasing the market pressure that the E.C.B.'s action was meant to end.
The euro was roughly unchanged at $1. 3061, after falling sharply Monday in New York.
Uncertainty about the Italian situation echoed around the world. Asian shares dropped Tuesday, with the Nikkei 225 stock average in Tokyo closing down 2.26 percent and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closing down 1.32 percent. New York stocks fell Monday, but were little changed Tuesday afternoon.
Olivier Bailly, a spokesman for the European Commission, the policy making arm of the European Union, on Tuesday urged Italy to form a government and to continue policies aimed at bringing down its public debt.
''The European Commission places its full confidence in Italian democracy, and the European Commission will work closely with the new government in order to relaunch growth and the creation of jobs in Italy,'' Mr. Bailly said during a news conference in Brussels.
He suggested that continuing reforms was the best way to combat the instability on financial markets that followed the vote. ''Markets are free to react the way they want,'' he said. Italian leaders needed to ''establish a political majority that will continue to deliver a growth and jobs agenda, which is basically what Italy needs in order to reduce the unsustainable level of its debt.''
According to a recent and wide-ranging study on the reform prospects for countries in the euro zone, the Lisbon Council, a research organization based in Brussels, concluded that Italy ranked last among all countries that use the euro in terms of its ability to generate economic growth over the long term.
Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, said on Tuesday that he was confident that the negative impact of the Italian vote on financial markets would be ''only in the short term.'' He told Spanish reporters that Italy would eventually manage to form ''a stable government,'' which would also be in the interest of Spain and the rest of the euro zone.
Before the election, Germany made very clear its expectations that whoever takes over in Rome must continue to implement the course of reforms begun under Mr. Monti. This line echoed throughout Berlin on Tuesday.
''It is important that Italy have a functioning government,'' Michael Grosse-Broemer, an important ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel and parliamentary floor leader of her center-right party, said Tuesday. ''Mr. Monti's course of reform must be continued.''
''There is no alternative to the course of structural reform that has been started,'' Philip Rösler, Germany's economy minister, told the German public broadcaster ARD, adding his disappointment at the apparent lack of support for the country's pro-reform parties .
Guido Westerwelle, the foreign minister, also called for Italy to swiftly form a ''stable and functioning government,'' stressing its importance for the rest of Europe.
But Werner Faymann, chancellor of Austria, warned against allowing concerns over the future Italian government to spark another debate over the future of the euro, insisting that the common currency was strong enough to withstand a period of instability.
''The euro remains stable even when it is not yet clear in any given country how a government will be formed,'' Mr. Faymann said, according to ARD.
How worried Germans are about what political chaos in Rome could mean for them came across clearly in the German media.
''The election shows that Italy remains susceptible for populist slogan. This is demonstrated by the nearly 25 percent support for the cheap, angry outbursts of the anti-party of comedian Beppe Grillo. And then the 30 percent for Berlusconi,'' wrote the daily Tagesspiegel in a commentary on Tuesday, pointing out that amounted to about every second voter supporting a populist.
''It is a very scary prospect that does not engender hope for Italy's future,'' the newspaper wrote. ''We are a long way from a cure for the Berlusconi disease.''
David Jolly reported from Paris. Rachel Donadio in Rome, James Kanter in Brussels, Melissa Eddy in Berlin, Raphael Minder in Madrid, and Landon Thomas Jr. in London contributed reporting.

 BODY:
1913 No Canal for Europe
WASHINGTON -- The United States has concluded a treaty with Nicaragua, by which the latter agrees that no nation other than the United States shall be permitted to construct an inter-oceanic canal through Nicaraguan territory. This treaty was made to forestall any European government seeking to build a rival to the Panama Canal. Under the terms of the convention, only the United States or Nicaragua may build a canal, and the treaty in effect is a notice that the United States proposes a monopoly of inter-oceanic canal transit in the hemisphere. 
1938 First Lady Opposes Rights Law
NEW YORK -- Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, considered one of the country's leading feminists, is opposed to a constitutional amendment, proposing equal rights for women under the law. The First Lady told a small group of women here that she would be delighted when the day arrived that protective legislation for women would no longer be needed, but for the present she believed that there was need of special treatment under the law. Mrs. Roosevelt cautioned her hearers against arguing solely from the point of view of their own experience or position. A woman had come to see her, she said, ''simply bursting'' with indignation that Mrs. Roosevelt was not in favor of the amendment. Upon being questioned, however, as to what industry she was employed in the visitor admitted she did nothing but deliver lectures.
1963 Invasion Dreams Shelved
HONG KONG -- Although Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek still promises to lead his Chinese Nationalist forces back to mainland China, it has now become apparent that his dreams for a ''sacred war of national recovery'' are quietly being shelved. Nationalist spokesmen repeatedly talk of recapturing China, but more attention is being devoted to the economic development of Formosa. Though never explicitly stated by officials, this would eventually lead to the creation of ''two Chinas,'' in which Formosa could flourish independently.

HEADLINE: Inconclusive Vote in Italy Points to Fragmenting of Political System

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO and NICHOLAS KULISH; Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ROME -- In recent years, recession and financial turmoil have felled governments throughout Europe as voters looked for change in an era of economic distress. Now, experts are asking whether politicians are capable of promoting plans that offer a way out of the malaise -- or whether they could be elected if they did.
After its voters this week denied any party enough backing to form a credible government, Italy joined Greece in preventing establishment parties from achieving the mandate required to push through painful reforms, inviting new financial instability. 
That dynamic is quite familiar to Americans, who have watched President Obama and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives lock horns over the debt ceiling, the so-called fiscal cliff and now sequestration in what many experts consider the biggest threat to the economy.
''The governing parties tilt ever more toward populism instead of making decisions that are important but unpopular,'' said Eckhard Jesse, professor of political systems and institutions at the Chemnitz University of Technology in Germany. ''The room to maneuver has gotten tighter, but the expectations have risen.''
In Italy, the surprise success of the Five Star Movement, founded by the comedian Beppe Grillo, has dashed hopes that the recent calm in financial markets was anything but a brief pause.
''We will change everything,'' said Nicoletta Febbraro, 57, a self-described ''flower child'' and follower of Mr. Grillo's, elected to the regional council in Lazio outside Rome.
The uncertain outcome of the election in Italy is only the latest illustration of how a sclerotic system has become increasingly fragmented, leaving fragile multiparty coalitions incapable of bold gestures and holding the reins of power only tentatively.
The question remains whether the phenomenon, in countries with high debt, aging populations and slower growth, is a natural outgrowth of the financial crisis and its aftermath or representative of a permanent shift, driven by demographic changes that have forced difficult policy choices, new technologies that have put the quick formation of mass movements within reach and an electorate with no patience for missteps or difficult reforms.
On Tuesday, Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of Italy's left-wing Democratic Party, called on the Five Star Movement to work with others to govern the country, rather than just calling for the existing politicians to go home. ''Until now, they've been saying: 'Everyone go home.' But now they're here, too,'' he said. ''So either they should go home as well, or say what they want to do for their country and their children.''
The Democratic Party, which campaigned against austerity, managed a relatively strong showing, finishing first in the lower house, although not in the Senate. The country's caretaker prime minister, Mario Monti, had been praised across Europe for his steady hand and willingness to try to reform the economy. Voters disagreed, giving his fledging civic movement about 10 percent of the vote, enough for only a fourth-place finish.
Blindsided by the success of the Five Star Movement, Italy's leading political parties struggled on Tuesday to find a governable majority. While the Democratic Party won in the lower house, it was the center-right party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi that came back from the grave to take control there. And so far, Mr. Grillo has shown no signs of moderating his position about forming alliances with the mainstream parties his people were elected to repudiate.
Gripped by economic and social malaise, voters are in a repudiating sort of mood. More and more people are casting their ballots against mainstream parties, choosing protest votes even when they know the fringe groups are unlikely to govern better, said Peter Filzmaier, professor for democracy studies and political research at the Danube University Krems, in Austria.
''We are experiencing a phase where it is enough for a party to be different for it to win votes,'' Mr. Filzmaier said. ''It could be the Pippi Longstocking party. It makes no difference.''
When they are not expressing their outrage at the ballot box, people are taking to the streets. In Bulgaria last week, the prime minister resigned in the face of nationwide protests.
In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has struggled for weeks to set up a coalition in a newly elected Parliament where 48 out of 120 lawmakers are new and the defiant Yesh Atid Party won 19 seats.
Traditional politicians, representing entrenched interests, are ill equipped to address the root of the problems, making the people even more contemptuous. And the upstart parties appear to have no solutions either, aside from turning over an old system that has fed distrust of the political class.
''There's a sense that the old politics, in whatever form and whatever country, have reached the limits of their ability to cope with a world that seems to be spiraling out of control,'' said Yossi Klein Halevi, a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, a research institute.
In Greece, where austerity measures imposed by foreign lenders have helped collapse the real economy, the leftist Syriza party nearly won national elections last May, prompting a second round. European leaders had a strong response: If Syriza was elected, Greece would be kicked out of the euro.
Today, Europe has more mechanisms to protect the single currency, and Syriza -- with its charismatic young leader, Alexis Tsipras -- is almost neck-and-neck with the governing center-right New Democracy party in polls. The party has a strong anti-austerity line and has criticized the established parties as tainted by cronyism and corruption.
The duration and depth of the problems have made them more difficult to stomach. The farther away solutions seem, the farther afield voters look for solutions.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Backs Treasury Choice

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - The Senate Finance Committee, dismissing some Republican objections, on Tuesday approved the nomination of Jacob J. Lew for Treasury secretary and sent it on to the full Senate for a confirmation vote in the days ahead. 
Mr. Lew, a longtime Democratic budget expert, received the support of all of Democrats on the committee as well as six Republicans, including Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior member of the opposition. The final vote was 19 to 5. Mr. Lew is widely expected to win confirmation, becoming the second Treasury secretary of Mr. Obama's presidency.
In the Obama administration, Mr. Lew has served as chief of staff, budget director and a high-level State Department official. Before then, he worked as budget director in the Clinton administration and on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Lew's short stints in the private sector drew considerable scrutiny during his confirmation process -- his third during the Obama administration, and fourth over all.
Just before the financial crisis, Mr. Lew was an executive at Citigroup, where he worked for a spell in a proprietary-trading unit that at one point benefited from the housing collapse. Mr. Lew never made investment decisions. But he did draw hundreds of thousands of dollars in salary and bonuses, and his contract contained an unusual provision allowing him to keep certain bonus income if he returned to a high position in the federal government.
Mr. Lew also won an unusual exit payment and a form of housing assistance from New York University, where he served as an administrator.
Republicans on the Finance Committee, particularly Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, pressed Mr. Lew for more details on his contracts with Citigroup and New York University, as well as an investment based in the Cayman Islands. Before the Finance Committee vote, Mr. Grassley, who did not support Mr. Lew, said that he felt that the nominee's answers were still unsatisfactory.
Ultimately, Mr. Lew -- known as bookish and unassuming, and a familiar figure in Congress -- won Republicans over. Senator Hatch praised his testimony during his hearing earlier this month, and said again Tuesday that he liked him personally. Republicans including Richard Shelby of Alabama and Rob Portman of Ohio have lined up behind him.
Mr. Lew is expected to win the support of the full Senate. As Treasury secretary, succeeding Timothy F. Geithner, he would face a slate of complicated budget issues.
On March 1, so-called ''sequestration'' comes into effect, and $85 billion in budget cuts, mostly to discretionary spending on the military and domestic programs, need to be made before the end of the fiscal year.
Later in March, Democrats and Republicans are gearing up for a fight over financing the government, threatening a government shutdown. And over the summer, the debt ceiling, a statutory limit on the amount the government can borrow, would need to be raised again.
More generally, the White House and Congress are still seeking a way to rein in large federal deficits without harming the sluggish recovery. The White House hopes to raise new tax revenue, primarily by closing loopholes in the tax code. Republicans are still seeking to reduce long-term spending on the entitlement programs of Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.

HEADLINE: Miami's Surprise Season, Meticulously Planned

BYLINE: By SCOTT CACCIOLA

 BODY:
CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Jim Larranaga always has a plan. He plans by the day, week, month and year. If anyone wonders how he stays so organized, Larranaga walks behind his desk here at BankUnited Center and opens two large cabinets, which house more than two decades' worth of Franklin Covey daily planners: thick, three-ring monstrosities the size of dictionaries.
Larranaga, the men's basketball coach at Miami, keeps track of everything in those binders. His goals. His team's statistics. His thoughts and observations. He also jots down what he expects to happen, and that includes the Hurricanes' remarkable rise this season. Larranaga was so confident in his team that he showed up at a board of trustees meeting last October and delivered a message.
''I told them this could be the best year in school history,'' he said this week. 
It was a low bar. Long known for the success -- and various suspected extracurriculars -- of its football program, Miami has an unexceptional basketball past, with six trips to the N.C.A.A. tournament and a lone appearance in the Round of 16 back in 2000. Yet in just his second season, Larranaga, 63, has built the team into an improbable contender, much as he did at George Mason, which he coached to the Final Four in 2006.
The Hurricanes (22-4, 13-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) are ranked No. 5 entering Wednesday's game against Virginia Tech, and their home games regularly sell out. Fans stormed the court Jan. 23 after a 27-point victory over Duke, then ranked No. 1. The Heat stars LeBron James and Dwyane Wade have made courtside cameos. And students, who line up for tickets on a patch of real estate known as Larranaga's Lawn, wear T-shirts that feature Larranaga's face on the front along with the slogan ''40 Minutes of L'' -- a play on the slightly more profane catchphrase of the high-octane teams at Arkansas in the 1990s.
''I thought it was hilarious,'' the assistant Michael Huger said, adding: ''People think because of Coach's age, he can't do this, he can't do that. Can't? That's not even in his vocabulary. He's healthy, he moves well, he communicates well, and his mind is sharp as a tack.''
Miami had won 14 straight games before last Saturday's loss at Wake Forest, a breakdown that was still fresh on Larranaga's mind this week. On Monday, he kept a box score in his pocket and cited what his team did wrong: ''Everything.'' Larranaga wants Miami to limit opponents to 40 percent shooting over all and 30 percent from beyond the 3-point line. Wake Forest shot 54.2 percent over all, 58.3 percent from long range.
In coping this week, Larranaga said he was relying on one of his favorite books, ''The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,'' by Stephen R. Covey. Citing the need for rest -- part of Habit No. 7 -- Larranaga did not have his players practice on Sunday and barred them from speaking with reporters until after Wednesday's game. ''The thing we can't afford to do is allow our priorities to change,'' Larranaga said.
There are times when Larranaga, who grew up in the Bronx, would seem right at home at a TED conference, exchanging innovative management ideas. Part coach and part management guru, he has always been fascinated by numbers and strategy, dating to his college days at Providence, where he started as a math major before switching to economics. (Economics, he said, was more practical.) As a basketball coach, he believes in the data-crunching wizardry of Ken Pomeroy, whose semi-eponymous basketball statistics Web site, KenPom.com, has been an invaluable resource for Larranaga for years.
Of particular interest are his team's offensive and defensive efficiency ratings, which are based on points per possession. According to Pomeroy, the Hurricanes rank 6th in defensive efficiency and 39th in offensive efficiency. Defense, Larranaga said, is the foundation. Scoring points? ''That keeps your players happy,'' he said.
On defense, he wants to limit his opponents to 12 points per position. In other words, if the starting point guard scores 9 points and his backup hits a 3-pointer, the limit has been reached. That also means opponents should average no more than 60 points a game. This season, opponents are averaging 59.2 points and 38.4 percent shooting. Larranaga's players get a dose of his man-to-man principles every day.
''Sometimes, it's reiterating things over and over,'' said the assistant Chris Caputo, who worked for Larranaga at George Mason. ''You need to get the message across, and I think we've given a very, very honest defensive effort the whole season -- other than the Wake Forest game.''
Larranaga preaches offensive balance. The goal is for each position on the floor to produce 15 points, for a total of 75. Miami is scoring 68.7 points a game, and the senior guard Durand Scott averages a team-high 13.3. Four others average at least 9 points. The Hurricanes operate with a collective sense of purpose that makes them extremely difficult to defend.
Larranaga also cited the positive influence of Shane Larkin, his pass-first point guard. Larkin, a sophomore and the son of the Hall of Fame shortstop Barry Larkin, averages 13.1 points and 4.3 assists.
''He was the missing piece of the puzzle,'' Larranaga said. ''If we need more passing, he can get the ball moving. If we need more scoring, he can score. If the big guys haven't touched the ball in a while, he knows to get it to them.''
Huger, the assistant, recalled interviewing with Larranaga for a coaching position at George Mason in 2007. There were 11 other candidates, and toward the end of a rigorous set of interviews, Larranaga invited Huger and his wife, Tonya, to meet at his office. Tonya Huger was struck by a long row of management books on Larranaga's desk, and she recognized one in particular, ''Good to Great,'' by the business consultant Jim Collins.
''You remember that quote where he writes, 'Get the right people on the bus, then figure out where to go?' '' she asked Larranaga. ''Well, Michael is the right guy to have on your bus. Now you need to decide where you're going to go.''
Her husband got the job.
In Larranaga's case, that message not only means hiring the right coaches and recruiting the right players. It also means that he must be flexible and willing to play to their strengths.
At George Mason, Larranaga coached players who were skilled at shooting off the catch, so his offense featured more down screens, with players popping out to take passes along the perimeter. At Miami, his top players are much more comfortable shooting off the dribble. As a result, Larranaga has incorporated more pick-and-rolls into his offensive sets.
There are differences on defense, too. With a smaller lineup at George Mason, Larranaga could full-court press and fluster opponents by double-teaming guards in the backcourt. Larranaga has more size but less quickness at Miami, so he puts a premium on protecting the lane.
''We're always adapting,'' Huger said. ''From one year to the next, we never keep the same plays.''
The only constants are Larranaga's baseline goals. Those never change. They go into the planner, and Larranaga hopes -- no, believes -- his players will make it happen.

HEADLINE: No Move Yet By U.N. Body After Test By Koreans

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; William J. Broad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The international expressions of anger and dismay that followed North Korea's announcement of a nuclear test a few weeks ago, punctuated by a United Nations Security Council pledge to immediately work on ''appropriate measures'' in a new resolution, appear to have given way to slow-motion diplomacy and some frustration that not even a draft has been circulated among the Council's 15 members.
United Nations diplomats privately said the process had become bogged down mainly over bridging differences between China and the United States about how forcefully to respond, in some ways replicating a pattern that has prevailed in deliberations taken previously in dealing with North Korea's defiant tests of ballistic missiles and nuclear devices. 
The frustration level, diplomats say, has been most prominent in South Korea, which has just sworn in a new leader, President Park Geun-hye. The frustration has been amplified because North Korea's announcement of a nuclear test on Feb. 12, its third, coincided with South Korea's turn as president of the Security Council under a monthly rotation system, giving South Korea a powerful measure of control over setting its priorities.
There had been hope in South Korea that a forceful Security Council resolution, expanding the economic penalties already in place against North Korea, would be completed and presented for a vote before South Korea relinquishes the presidential gavel at the end of Thursday to Russia, the Council president for March.
But given the lack of progress, that prospect appears unlikely, diplomats said. And Russia, like China, appears in no hurry to take action that, in its view, would only further antagonize North Korea and destabilize the Korean Peninsula. ''The South Koreans would like to see a resolution during their tenure,'' one diplomat said.
Members of the South Korean Mission to the United Nations did not respond to telephone messages or e-mails regarding the status of a North Korean resolution.
North Korea has said it would regard any new Security Council resolution as a provocation. Since the Feb. 12 test, the North has threatened to conduct more tests, promulgated video propaganda showing President Obama covered in fire, and vowed a ''miserable destruction'' of American and South Korean forces should they proceed with planned joint military exercises in March.
China has shown increasing impatience with North Korea, a destitute nation that depends on China for vital economic aid and trade. But on Tuesday China signaled its cautious approach on a Security Council resolution. A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, was quoted by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying the Council's discussions ''should be conducive to the denuclearization of the peninsula as well as peace and stability in northeast Asia.''
Xinhua said the spokeswoman was responding to comments made earlier by Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, who was quoted as saying in Moscow that any Security Council resolution ''must confirm that negotiations are the only choice for the parties involved.''
There has been no public indication that China would be willing to expand the sanctions against North Korea, which cover military and dual-use goods, as well as luxury items for the elite. Nor has China given any indication that it would be willing to stop trade that helps keep its longtime ally afloat.
Diplomats and scholars of China-North Korea history say that although China increasingly regards North Korea as intransigent, it does not wish to take any steps that would collapse North Korea's government.
Many expect to see another Security Council resolution, which may have the appearance of consequences, but nothing that China would regard as destabilizing. No clues have emerged on whether North Korea used plutonium or uranium to fuel the recent blast. The impoverished state is rich in uranium deposits, and a switch to that fuel in theory could speed the expansion of its arsenal since Western intelligence officials believe that its plutonium supplies are limited.
In the two weeks since the underground test, Western states and a United Nations agency have monitored winds for signs of radioactive seepage that might answer the question. No finds have yet been reported.

HEADLINE: With Virginia Shipyard as Backdrop, Obama Warns Again on Cuts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and THOM SHANKER; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
NEWPORT NEWS, Va. -- President Obama flew on Tuesday to the vast shipyard where the nation's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers are built to send a warning that automatic cuts in the Pentagon budget, only three days away, threatened the jobs of tens of thousands of workers and America's fragile economic recovery.
''This work, along with hundreds of thousands of jobs, are currently in jeopardy because of politics in Washington,'' the president told a crowd of several hundred at Newport News Shipbuilding, which employs 21,000 people in Virginia and is the state's largest industrial employer. ''These cuts are wrong. They're not smart. They are not fair. They are a self-inflicted wound that doesn't have to happen.'' 
In a sign of the deepening intransigence on both sides, Republicans dismissed Mr. Obama's remarks as political grandstanding and accused him of trying to scare Americans by exaggerating the impact of the cuts. They mocked Mr. Obama's recent trips to sound alarms about the budget cuts as campaign-style events that would not ease the nation's fiscal problems.
House Speaker John A. Boehner said the president was using the country's ''military men and women as a prop in yet another campaign rally,'' and showed no willingness to accept Mr. Obama's demands for more revenue by closing tax loopholes. ''Spending is the problem, and spending cuts are the solution,'' Mr. Boehner said on Capitol Hill. ''Yes, we should close loopholes, but we should do it as part of tax reform that lowers rates and helps create jobs.''
But any compromise seemed increasingly elusive and Republican lawmakers appeared divided about how to proceed. Senate Republicans emerged Tuesday from a policy meeting at odds over what they should offer to replace or mitigate across-the-board spending cuts slated to hit Friday, probably postponing a showdown in the Senate on the parties' two approaches.
Newport News Shipbuilding is the nation's only builder of the Navy's nuclear-powered carriers and one of only two builders of nuclear-powered submarines. Pentagon officials say the prospect of the automatic cuts, known as the sequester, has delayed the Navy's overhaul of the carrier Abraham Lincoln at the shipyard, and would also delay construction of a future aircraft carrier, the John F. Kennedy. The Navy has already signaled that the cuts would delay the routine deployment of a second carrier to the Persian Gulf region.
But Mr. Obama's trip to the shipyard was intended to draw attention to what officials say would have a far bigger financial impact at home -- the loss of economic activity and jobs at private companies that do contract work for the military. White House officials said the cuts could cost thousands of jobs at the shipyard and at the many suppliers around the country who provide the raw materials to build the nation's fleet of warships.
''Already, the uncertainty around these cuts is having an effect,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Companies are starting to prepare for layoff notices. The longer these cuts are in place, the greater the damage.''
The visit was part of a continuing effort by the Obama administration to dramatize the real-world impact of the budget cuts, which were enacted 18 months ago by both parties as a way of persuading lawmakers to compromise on less onerous ways of reducing the deficit. Joining Mr. Obama on Air Force One for the brief flight from Washington was Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia, whose district includes Norfolk and parts of Newport News near the shipyard.
He told reporters that he agreed with the president on the need for tax increases to go along with spending cuts -- a view that splits him from his conservative colleagues.
''I believe that a position that says we will reject a proposal if it has even a dollar increase in revenue, I don't think that's a wise position and I don't hold that value,'' Mr. Rigell said, adding he favors getting rid of ''lobbyist-inspired, lobbyist-written loopholes. I am in favor of that.''
But he criticized the president for not offering a specific proposal to resolve the impasse.
''I think both parties are responsible for where we are now,'' Mr. Rigell said.
The president, however, praised Mr. Rigell at the event, giving him credit for being willing to join Democrats in calling for the closing of tax loopholes rather than letting the automatic spending cuts happen. ''That's not always healthy for a Republican, being with me,'' Mr. Obama said.
The president said the budget cuts set to take effect on Friday would severely affect companies that depend on the defense industry and their workers.
Although military officials say there will be little visible impact on the country's fighting ability immediately after the cuts begin, they say the damage would build over weeks and months as ground brigades scheduled to go to Afghanistan do not receive the training they need.
Military officials have said that within a year it is possible that two-thirds of Army and Marine Corps ground combat brigades would not have been trained or equipped to merit a rating of full readiness. Likewise, Air Force and Navy pilots eventually may not be able to fly the required training hours for readiness certification.
''This is not a government shutdown,'' said George Little, the Pentagon press secretary. ''But it will start the erosion of our military readiness, and we will soon see impacts to bases and installations around the world.''
The Defense department has already notified 800,000 civilian employees that they may be subject to temporary furloughs that would require them to take leaves without pay in the remaining seven months of the current budget year.
Before his remarks, Mr. Obama toured the sprawling facility, where sections of the John Warner and the Illinois, two Virginia-class submarines, were under construction. The company, which has built more than 800 military ships since it was formed in 1886, has revenues of $3.5 billion per year.

HEADLINE: Dimon Pledges to Change JPMorgan's Practices on Payday Loans

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, vowed on Tuesday to change how the bank deals with Internet-based payday lenders that automatically withdraw payments from borrowers' checking accounts. 
At an investor meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Dimon called the practice, which was the subject of an article in The New York Times on Sunday, ''terrible.'' He said JPMorgan was examining the issue and would make changes.
While JPMorgan Chase does not make the loans directly, the bank, along with other giants like Bank of America and Wells Fargo, enable the online payday lenders to deduct payments from customers' checking accounts, even in the 15 states where the loans are banned entirely. The withdrawals sometimes continue even after customers have pleaded with the banks to prevent the lenders from tapping their accounts.
The banks are a critical link for payday lenders, which are increasingly moving online, to evade statewide caps on interest rates. The loans can carry annual interest rates above 500 percent. Without access to customers' checking accounts, the lenders, according to state and federal authorities, would not be as easily able to make loans to residents in states where high-interest payday loans are banned.
Lawmakers have taken aim at the issue, too. In July, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, introduced a bill that would restrict the payday lenders by forcing them to follow laws in states where the borrower is located, rather than where the lender is. Another crucial aspect of the bill, which is pending in Congress, is a provision allowing borrowers to more easily stop the automatic withdrawals.
For payday loan customers, many of whom are shouldering a glut of overdue bills, the automatic withdrawals sometimes cause a wave of fees.
According to a report released this month by the Pew Charitable Trusts, an estimated 27 percent of payday loan borrowers say the loans caused them to overdraw their accounts.
In the Times article on Sunday, two JPMorgan Chase customers explained their travails in trying to persuade the bank to halt automatic withdrawals.
Ivy Brodsky, one customer in Brooklyn, was charged $1,523 in fees by Chase, after six Internet payday lenders tried to take money from her account 55 times in a single month. Ms. Brodsky thought the withdrawals would stop after she visited her Chase branch in March to close the account.
Subrina Baptiste, an educational assistant in Brooklyn, said the overdraft fees charged by Chase ate into her child-support income. Ms. Baptiste said she begged Chase to stop automatic withdrawals on loans she got in 2011.
Under New York law, the loans, which came with interest rates of more than 500 percent, are illegal.
Both Ms. Baptiste and Ms. Brodsky sued Chase in federal court in New York last year. JPMorgan Chase said in a statement on Tuesday that it was ''in discussions with these customers to resolve their issues'' and added that the bank apologized ''to them for the problems they had.''
JPMorgan officials are ''taking a thorough look at all of our policies related to these issues and plan to make meaningful changes,'' the statement said.
A spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association did not have an immediate comment.

HEADLINE: A First Step On Medicare: Slow Down And Think

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
What's the rush? For all the white-knuckled wrangling over spending cuts set to start on Friday, the fundamental partisan argument over how to fix the government's finances is not about the immediate future. It is about the much longer term: how will the nation pay for the care of older Americans as the vast baby boom generation retires? Will the government keep Medicare spending in check by asking older Americans to shoulder more costs? Should we raise taxes instead?
It might not be a good idea to try to resolve these questions quite so urgently. Partisan bickering under the threat of automatic budget cuts is unlikely to produce a calm, thoughtful deal.
''We don't have to solve this tomorrow; not even next year,'' said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who worked on the design of President Obama's health care reform. 
More significantly perhaps, some economists point out that the problem may already be on the way toward largely fixing itself. The budget-busting rise in health care costs, it seems, is finally losing speed. While it would be foolhardy to assume that this alone will stabilize government's finances, the slowdown offers hope that the challenge may not be as daunting as the frenzied declarations from Washington make it seem.
The growth of the nation's spending slowed sharply over the last four years. This year, it is expected to increase only 3.8 percent, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the slowest pace in four decades and slower than the rate of nominal economic growth.
Medicare spending is growing faster -- stretched by baby boomers stepping out of the work force and into retirement. But its pace has slowed markedly, too. Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office said that by 2020 Medicare spending would be $126 billion less than it predicted three years ago. Spending over the coming decade, it added, would be $143 billion less than it forecast just last August.
While economists acknowledge that the recession accounts for part of the decline, depressing incomes and consumption, something else also seems to be going on: insurers, doctors, hospitals and other providers are experimenting with new, cheaper and more efficient ways to deliver care.
Prodded by President Obama's Affordable Care Act, which offers providers a share of savings reaped by Medicare from any efficiency gains, many doctors are dropping the costly practice of charging a fee for each service regardless of its contribution to patients' health. Doctors are joining hundreds of so-called Accountable Care Organizations, which are paid to maintain patients in good health and are thus encouraged to seek the most effective treatments at the lowest possible cost.
This has kindled hope among some scholars that Medicare could achieve the needed savings just by cleaning out the health care system's waste.
Elliott Fisher, who directs Dartmouth's Atlas of Health Care, which tracks disparities in medical practices and outcomes across the country, pointed out that Medicare spending per person varies widely regardless of quality -- from $7,734 a year in Minneapolis to $11,646 in Chicago -- even after correcting for the different age, sex and race profiles of their populations.
He noted that if hospital stays by Medicare enrollees across the country fell to the length prevailing in Oregon and Washington, hospital use -- one of the biggest drivers of costs -- would fall by almost a third.
''Twenty to 30 percent of Medicare spending is pure waste,'' Dr. Fisher argues. ''The challenge of getting those savings is nontrivial. But those kinds of savings are not out of the question.''
We could be disappointed, of course. Similar breakthroughs before have quickly fizzled. Just think back to that brief spell in the mid-1990s when health maintenance organizations seemed to beat health care inflation -- until patients rebelled against being denied services and doctors dropped out of their networks rather than accept lower fees.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services already expects spending to rebound in coming years. Without tougher cost control devices, be it vouchers to limit government spending or direct government rationing, counting on savings of the scale needed to overcome the expected increase in Medicare rolls may be hoping for pie in the sky.
''It makes no sense,'' said Eugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban Institute, to expect the government will reap vast Medicare savings without having an impact on the quality of care.
The Affordable Care Act already contemplates fairly big cuts to Medicare. In its latest long-term projections published last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that under current law, growth in spending per beneficiary over the coming decade would be about half a percentage point slower than the rate of economic growth per person.
To understand how ambitious this is, consider that Medicare spending per beneficiary since 1985 has exceeded the growth of gross domestic product per person by about 1.5 percentage points per year. Slowing down that spending would require deep cuts in doctor reimbursements that, though written into law, Congress has never allowed to happen -- repeatedly voting to cancel or postpone them.
Under a more realistic situation, the Budget Office projected that the growth of Medicare spending per capita over the next 10 years would be in fact 0.6 percentage points higher than under current law and accelerate further after that.
Yet despite the ambition of these targets, they would not be enough to stabilize future Medicare spending as a share of the economy. A report by three health care policy experts, Michael Chernew and Richard Frank of Harvard Medical School, together with Stephen Parente of the University of Minnesota, concluded that to do that would require limiting the growth of spending per beneficiary at 1.25 percentage points less than the growth of our gross domestic product per person.
''The Affordable Care Act places Medicare spending on a trajectory that is historically low,'' Mr. Chernew said, noting his opinion was not an official statement as vice chairman of Medicare's Payment Advisory Commission, which advises Congress on Medicare. ''Could we do better? Of course. Will we? That requires a little more skepticism.''
Yet even if it is unrealistic to expect that newfound efficiencies will stabilize Medicare's finances, the slowdown in health care spending suggests that politicians in Washington calm down. It offers, at the very least, more breathing room to carefully consider reforms to the system to raise revenue or trim benefits in the least damaging way.
There are many ideas out there -- from changing Medicare's premiums, deductibles and coinsurance to introducing a tax on carbon emissions to raise revenue. Some of them are not as good as others. Until recently, President Obama favored increasing the eligibility age for Medicare. Then research by the Kaiser Family Foundation concluded that raising the age would increase insurance premiums and cost businesses, beneficiaries and states more than the federal government would save. The nation would lose money in the deal.
''As we do this, there are smarter and dumber ways to do it,'' Mr. Gruber said. ''It would be a problem if we were to do things in a panic mode that set us backward.''

HEADLINE: After Years of Delay, A Lower East Side Gap Is Ready to Be Filled

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
Nearly half a century after a neighborhood of tenements on the Lower East Side was razed in the name of urban renewal, the area -- which happens to be the largest undeveloped swath of city-owned land in Manhattan south of 96th Street -- is finally poised for redevelopment. Last month, the city released a request for proposals from developers, ending a bitter chapter in New York City's development history.
The nine sites, including several parking lots along the south side of Delancey Street from Essex Street to the Williamsburg Bridge, make up 1.65 million square feet of space for development. The city's proposal is a hard-fought compromise for a six-acre slice of Manhattan that has been a trigger point since nearly 2,000 residents were displaced and most of their homes bulldozed in 1967.
While the rest of the Lower East Side grew into a hip neighborhood of fashionable restaurants, chic hotels and glassy condos, the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area stood out as a dreary reminder of the failings of urban planning. But three years ago, the city gingerly revived discussions with vying neighborhood factions. 
Led by the community board, they drew a road map for redevelopment, paving the way for a substantial expansion of the Lower East Side, one that will eventually reconnect the northern and southern tiers of the neighborhood. (The Lower East Side stretches from Houston Street south to Canal Street and is bound by the Bowery and the East River.)
''Forty-five years is a very long time to look at those lots everyday, and that wasn't something that we wanted to continue for another 40 years,'' said Gigi Li, the chairwoman of Community Board 3. ''I think this time when all the stakeholders were called, we were really hoping that this would be the time that everything would move along.''
For decades, advocates of affordable housing sparred with residents of the powerful Grand Street co-ops, who preferred more market-rate housing and commercial uses for the site. The new agreement splits the difference, calling for 1,000 new units of housing, half of which will be permanently affordable. The 500 affordable units will be a mix of housing for seniors, and low- to moderate-income housing for families earning from 60 to 165 percent of the area's median income.
The remaining 40 percent of the development area will be reserved for commercial uses, with up to 600,000 square feet of commercial space that will include street level retailing, and a hotel or office space. The plan also calls for 15,000 square feet of open public space and a new public school.
As it is, the renewal area ''is a huge hole in that neighborhood. It really turns Delancey into a hard border,'' said Nat Rockett, an executive vice president at Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm. ''Putting something on that site will unify the Lower East Side into one relatively contiguous neighborhood.''
The redevelopment area includes sites north of Delancey, which house the Essex Street market and a health clinic, and a parcel on Grand Street with a five-story residential building and a former fire station. As part of the agreement, a community board task force will weigh in on the proposals, and the city expects to make a final selection by fall.
Interest among developers has been frenzied, city officials said. Since the announcement, bidding information has been downloaded from the city's Web site 750 times by parties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut as well as other states including Arizona, California, Georgia and Missouri, according to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has led the effort along with the city's Economic Development Corporation.
More than 200 people turned up at a city information session this month, including representatives from the Related Companies, Forest City Ratner, Edward J. Minskoff Equities and AvalonBay Communities, a developer based in Arlington, Va.
''All anybody could talk about was Seward Park. The buzz was palpable,'' Mathew M. Wambua, the commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said of his conversations with developers at a recent real estate industry event.
Gotham Organization, which is developing affordable housing in Hell's Kitchen, confirmed through a spokesman that it planned to bid on the site. The city, however, prohibits developers from discussing their proposals publicly.
''It's the largest public opportunity that we've seen in a very long time, and developers are cognizant of that,'' said Jamie Torres Springer, a partner at HR&A, a real estate advisory firm that was involved in the development of the High Line. His firm has been advising a developer on a proposal for the renewal area, although he declined to name his client.
Some developers, however, are wary of the strict restrictions on market-rate housing. ''I think at that ratio, we would have pause to throw our hat in the ring,'' said Joshua A. Schuster, a principal at DHA Capital, which recently built market-rate rental lofts on Pitt Street. Mr. Schuster says he does not plan to bid on the site, but has considered acquiring other sites south of Delancey Street in anticipation of the changes.
Others still question putting affordable housing on such valuable land. ''Why are you taking a commercial viable location and building affordable housing?'' said Harold Jacob, general manager of the East River Housing Corporation., one of the co-op complexes in the area. ''What the city should have done was build low-income housing in a different area,'' Mr. Jacob, who goes by Heshy, said.
Another piece of the redevelopment puzzle is the Essex Street market, a 15,000-square-foot public market at the corner of Essex and Delancey Streets. The market, a collection of food vendors, is housed in an antiquated brick building that lacks public restrooms. But it occupies a prime location on the northern side of Delancey Street. The Economic Development Corporation, which manages the property, pledged to preserve the market in a new, larger space. Vendors worry, though, that a move south of Delancey Street would cost them foot traffic.
''The reality of the real estate market is that developers are not going to give a prime real estate location to the market space. They'll put it in a less desirable spot,'' said Rhonda Kave, owner of Roni-Sue's Chocolates, standing in front of her 200-square foot shop one recent morning.
Attempts to redevelop this part of the Lower East Side have failed for different reasons over the years. The effort was contentious from the start, sparking protests from advocates of affordable housing long before demolition began.
A few years after the building demolition began in 1967, financing dried up and redevelopment efforts were scuttled. In the 1980s, the LeFrak Organization failed in a bid to redevelop it. Most recently, in 2003, opponents blocked a city effort that called for a mix of low- and middle-income housing at a community board meeting that grew so heated racial epithets were exchanged.
But in recent years, positions have softened. The Grand Street co-ops, a longtime labor union stronghold that had the support of Sheldon Silver, the powerful New York State Assembly speaker who represents the Lower East Side, suffered a loss of influence as new residents arrived. New City Council members like Margaret Chin threw their support behind affordable housing. So, on the heels of a rezoning of the Lower East Side in 2008, the community board took another stab at the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area.
''The dynamics changed; the elected officials changed,'' said Tito Delgado, who lived in a tenement in the area as a boy with his parents and four siblings. ''Once we sat at the table, we realized we had more in common than we thought. That was very enlightening to me.'' He described a working-class community made up mainly of immigrants.
After years of fighting and uncertainty, the general mood is one of stunned relief, people involved in the process said. Mr. Delgado, who hopes to return as a tenant in the new development, said: ''This has been quite a journey. I still can't believe it's happening.''

HEADLINE: New Report on Syrian Missiles Shows Extent of Death and Damage

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD; Hania Mourtada and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and Michael R. Gordon from Berlin.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The Syrian government fired at least four ballistic missiles last week that hit civilian neighborhoods in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, killing more than 141 people, including 71 children, according to a Human Rights Watch report released on Tuesday.
Syrian antigovernment activists had reported the missile strikes last week, corroborated by video of the aftermath posted on the Internet, but the Human Rights Watch report contained new details about the number of missile strikes and the scope of destruction, with a death toll that was far higher than previously thought. 
''The extent of the damage from a single strike, the lack of aircraft in the area at the time, and reports of ballistic missiles being launched from a military base near Damascus overwhelmingly suggest that government forces struck these areas with ballistic missiles,'' the report said.
The assessment came as both sides' international backers called with increasing urgency for a political solution but remained unable to get the antagonists to talk. That impasse has been the main focus of the first foreign trip by John Kerry, the new American secretary of state, who met with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, on Tuesday to try to push the Syrian combatants into talks.
Fighting intensified in Aleppo, including around the 12th-century Umayyad Mosque, one of the architectural centerpieces of Aleppo's Old City, and around a long-contested police academy, according to rebels and the government.
The ballistic missile strikes felled entire buildings in destruction that stands out even after months of fighting, according to Human Rights Watch. Its researchers visited all four sites, in residential areas, and found no evidence of military targets nearby, making the attacks a violation of international law, the organization said.
A resident of Ard al-Hamra, one of the neighborhoods hit, said he had just left his brother's house after evening tea on Friday when ''the sky was lit up by a tremendous flash and all air was sucked away.''
He ran back to find that ''my brother's house was gone,'' he told Human Rights Watch. ''We managed to find my five young nieces and nephews, aged between 3 and 17 years old. They were all dead under the rubble. We still have not found my brother. When will somebody stop this madness?''
As the death toll from the Syrian conflict exceeds 70,000, according to United Nations estimates, and the destruction of major cities continues unabated, fears are mounting that the conflict will spread throughout the region.
Jeffrey D. Feltman, the United Nations' top political official, told the Security Council during a Middle East briefing, ''The destructive military spiral churns more forcefully each day and threatens to pull its neighbors, most notably and worrisomely Lebanon, into its vortex.''
Lebanon, torn apart by political disagreements over Syria and longstanding sectarian divides exacerbated by the increasingly sectarian killing in Syria, last week became the country hosting the largest number of Syrian refugees, even though it is Syria's smallest and most politically vulnerable neighbor.
''Even tentative steps to dialogue are struggling to take root,'' Mr. Feltman said, referring to offers of negotiations issued -- with caveats and conditions -- by both the Syrian opposition and government in recent days. ''Regrettably, the warring parties remain locked in military logic which is bound to bring more death and destruction.''
Before a meeting in Rome on Thursday of the opposition's international backers, the main opposition group remains under pressure to further unify and organize itself -- in part to make sure there is someone for the government to meet with should talks become possible.
The opposition group, the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, has said that on Saturday it will select a prime minister to run an interim government to be established in rebel-held areas of northern Syria. But the group has set and missed such deadlines in the past, and members say there is no consensus yet on who should fill the post.
Even if a prime minister is appointed and empowered to negotiate with the Syrian government, it is unclear if talks will take place. The government of President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia, has long insisted that Mr. Assad be part of the process, while the opposition coalition, backed by the United States, declares that he cannot be.
Seeking to resolve that impasse, Mr. Kerry had his first meeting as secretary of state with Mr. Lavrov of Russia on Tuesday in Berlin.
The meeting covered the range of American-Russian issues, from economic relations to adoption of Russian orphans. But more than half of the session was devoted to the situation in Syria.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Kerry's predecessor as secretary of state, believed she had worked out an agreement with the Russians in Geneva in June that would have established the framework for negotiations on a political transition to a post-Assad government. But the Russians interpreted the agreement differently, saying that the understanding that Mr. Assad should leave power could not be a precondition for the talks.
Mr. Kerry, who has said he has new ideas on how to advance diplomacy on Syria, has been looking for a way to secure Russian backing for a transition.
''It was a really serious and hard-working session,'' said Victoria Nuland, the State Department's spokeswoman. Much of the discussion, she said, ''focused on Syria and how we can work together to implement the Geneva agreement.''
Mr. Lavrov told Russian news agencies after the meeting that Russia would try to establish the conditions for initiating ''a dialogue between the government and the opposition.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P.'s Ideological Split Appears in Virginia Governor's Race

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Va. -- As Republicans debate ways to appeal to voters whom their positions have pushed away, some Republican leaders in Virginia are warning that the party is poised to repeat the mistakes of last November, choosing a nominee for governor who turns off younger, female and nonwhite voters.
Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the presumed nominee, is a combative conservative who calls the Obama administration ''the biggest set of lawbreakers in America'' as he seeks to lead an increasingly purple state that twice voted for Mr. Obama.
''I don't think as a whole the Republican Party in Virginia is moving in the right direction,'' said Ken Stolle, the Republican sheriff of Virginia Beach. ''I think we're limiting our appeal and that's why we're losing elections.'' 
Mr. Cuccinelli, as attorney general, sued the federal government over the 2010 health care law, questioned global warming and authorized the state police to check the citizenship of anyone they stop.
At a closed-door meeting of Republican business leaders in Washington on Friday, two prominent Virginia executives confronted Mr. Cuccinelli for being too ideological to win in 2013, in what will likely be the highest-profile election nationally this year.
Much of the unease emanates from the camp of Gov. Bob McDonnell, and especially his lieutenant governor, William T. Bolling, who in an interview called Mr. Cuccinelli ''an ideological firebrand who is outside the mainstream of Virginia.''
Mr. Bolling is open to charges of sour grapes: He sought the nomination for governor but withdrew in the face of support by party activists for Mr. Cuccinelli. Still, his outspoken criticism is riveting Richmond's political class.
In his office downhill from the whitewashed Capitol designed by Thomas Jefferson, Mr. Bolling, who is considering a race as an independent, said of Mr. Cuccinelli: ''I think he believes there is a huge silent majority of voters out there just waiting for a candidate like him to come along and espouse unadulterated conservative ideology. That's not the way I read the Virginia electorate.''
Earlier in the day, Mr. Cuccinelli, 44, called that view of him a caricature. As he strode across Capitol Square, where lawmakers greeted him as ''General,'' he noted that he had been elected three times to the State Senate from Northern Virginia, outside Washington, the state's most Democratic region. ''It's not some Podunk little thing,'' he said of his Fairfax County district. ''You had to earn it.''
Mr. Cuccinelli's campaign is pointing to lesser-known chapters of his biography, like his lead in opposing human trafficking in Virginia. He has also worked to expand mental health treatment. It even notes that as an undergraduate at the University of Virginia he took part in protests calling for the hiring of a sexual assault awareness educator.
''His record is more complicated than he's given credit for,'' said Larry Sabato, a political scientist who taught Mr. Cuccinelli in an Introduction to American Politics class.
Polling shows a dead heat between Mr. Cuccinelli and his presumed Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe, a businessman and former political operative, with both getting 38 percent of registered voters in a Quinnipiac University survey last week. (A three-way race including Mr. Bolling showed him pulling more support from the Republican than the Democrat.)
Whether Mr. Cuccinelli is too conservative for Virginia voters remains a question: 30 percent of voters hold a favorable view of him, 25 percent unfavorable. But nearly half of voters said they still did not know enough about him to form an opinion.
The McAuliffe campaign has seized on that gap in knowledge to paint Mr. Cuccinelli as an enemy of women's health and bipartisanship, and so far Mr. Cuccinelli, to the frustration of some in his party, has done little to address issues of jobs and the economy that might appeal to independents.
His team's theory of the campaign appears to be that he can win by exciting the grass-roots alone, a stratagem made plausible because voters in an off-year election are older, whiter and more conservative.
Mr. Cuccinelli's most visible campaign statement is a book, ''The Last Line of Defense,'' published this month, which recounts high-profile battles that made him a hero to the Tea Party.
Although the Supreme Court upheld the health care law last year, it struck down a requirement that states must expand Medicaid to low-income families.
Without the health care suit, ''we wouldn't be having the Medicaid expansion debate,'' said Mr. Cuccinelli, who opposes extending Medicaid, even as eight Republican governors have reversed course to do so.
Mr. Cuccinelli recalls in his book how his mother was hospitalized for six months when he was a boy, when the family had no health insurance. ''Despite the hardship, the last thing my parents thought about doing was asking the government to force other people to pay our bills,'' he writes.
As attorney general, Mr. Cuccinelli brought suit against the Environmental Protection Agency, claiming as he writes in his book that the impact of carbon dioxide on man-made global warming was ''junk science'' from the United Nations. The suit was dismissed.
He said last month that opponents of the federal mandate to include contraception in health insurance should consider going to jail in protest.
Such views prompted two state business leaders to openly challenge Mr. Cuccinelli last week at a meeting of the Republican Governors Association in Washington, participants said. One executive, Bobbie Kilberg, who was a leading Mitt Romney fund-raiser in Virginia, declined to confirm the account, first reported by Politico. But in an interview Ms. Kilberg said she believed Mr. Cuccinelli was too polarizing.
''Everyone is going to be focused on Virginia as an indication of the future direction of the party nationally,'' Ms. Kilberg said. ''It is exceptionally important that that direction be a mainstream direction.''
Last week Governor McDonnell, who is limited to a single term, harpooned one of the great white whales of Virginia politics -- a long-elusive fix for the state's crumbling roads -- by reaching a compromise with Democrats.
Before it passed in a tense final day of the General Assembly, Mr. Cuccinelli denounced the plan because it raises taxes and issued a last-minute legal opinion that almost derailed it. Mr. McDonnell seemed to rebuff Mr. Cuccinelli when he declared, ''There is a 'Virginia Way' of cooperation and problem-solving.''
Nonetheless, a Republican state senator who voted with the governor, John Watkins, said Mr. Cuccinelli was ''more of a pragmatist than he gets credit for.''
''I think it's probably premature to write him off because of his strong social conservatism,'' Mr. Watkins said.
And on Tuesday, Mr. McDonnell extended his support in a television interview, saying, ''I think we're going to have Governor Cuccinelli here in about eight months.''
Mr. Sabato, the political scientist at the University of Virginia, said both Mr. McAuliffe, who has never held elective office, and Mr. Cuccinelli are imperfect candidates whose luster improves when held up to the other. ''They're both running against the only person who could elect them,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bonus Pay On Wall St. Rose 9% Last Year

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
7:39 p.m. | Updated
Wall Street may be shrinking -- cutting thousands of jobs over the last year -- but for those who remain, the pay is still very lucrative. 
The average cash bonus for those employed in the financial industry in New York last year rose roughly 9 percent, to $121,900, Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York State's comptroller, said on Tuesday.
Cash bonuses in total are forecast to increase by roughly 8 percent, to $20 billion this year.
The total, however, is down from 2010, when it was $22.8 billion. Wall Street's peak came in 2006, before the financial crisis, with a total $34.3 billion in bonuses. The year-end bonus can account for the bulk of a finance professional's annual compensation.
The report from the state comptroller's office gives estimates on the bonuses, based on tax withholding data, data from banks and conversations with industry experts. It came the same day that JPMorgan Chase, one of the country's biggest banks, announced it was eliminating 17,000 jobs over the next two years through layoffs and attrition, adding its name to a string of large banks that continue to cut jobs to reduce expenses.
Wall Street has regained 30 percent of the 28,300 jobs lost during the financial crisis, Mr. DiNapoli said. And firms are continuing to streamline as they cope with a sluggish economic recovery, difficult markets and a heavier regulatory burden. While financial industry employment in New York City was steady in the first half of 2012, it was down slightly in the second half of the year, the comptroller's office said.
''Wall Street is still in transition, but it is very slowly adjusting to changes in its economic and regulatory environment,'' he said.
In an effort to hold down -- albeit temporarily -- compensation costs, a number of financial firms have deferred cash payments to employees in recent years. Mr. DiNapoli said on Tuesday that part of the increase in 2012 was cash promised in recent years but actually paid out last year. He said that it was difficult to break out what percentage of the total was deferrals, but he believed that it was still a small part of the total.
The ebbs and flows of Wall Street pay have a major impact on the economy of New York City, where 169,700 are employed in finance. Local businesses like restaurants, luxury goods retailers and the upper end of the real estate market pin their fortunes to the flood of cash from year-end bonuses.
Before the start of the financial crisis, business and personal income tax collections from finance-related activities accounted for up to 20 percent of New York State tax revenue. In 2012, that contribution fell to 14 percent.
Yet finance remains the best paying sector in New York City, Mr. DiNapoli told reporters during a conference call.
All told, the average pay package for securities industry employees in New York was $362,900 in 2011, the last year for which data is available, almost unchanged from 2010.
''Profits and bonuses rebounded in 2012, but the industry is still restructuring,'' Mr. DiNapoli said. Despite its smaller size, the securities industry is still a very important part of the New York City and New York State economies.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tax on Trades Is a Simple Idea With Unintended Outcomes

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Some say that a financial transaction tax is a cost-free way to kill many a bird with one stone -- raising revenue, preventing financial crashes and making markets safer. But advocates of this neat idea conveniently ignore the century of less-than-successful experience with this tax, including New York State's own failed attempt.
The idea behind a financial transaction tax, which is a tax on individual market trades, has a smart pedigree. John Maynard Keynes suggested it, and James Tobin, a Nobel laureate in economics, was its most famous modern advocate. Tobin, who died in 2002, wanted to ''throw some sand in the wheels'' of the markets, and his idea, endorsed by Joseph Stiglitz and Lawrence H. Summers among others, is based on an increasingly held belief that markets are far from efficient. Imposing a transaction tax on each individual trade would eliminate wasteful trading and reduce market volatility, ending short-term speculation and mispricing of assets.
This net benefit is paired with a simple budget argument. The Robin Hood Tax campaign in Britain, for example, has used the slogan ''Not complicated. Just brilliant'' to support a 0.05 percent tax on transactions as an effective way to ease the budget without harming markets. Let's face it, the banks are an easy target after the financial crisis. 
It seems to be a win for everyone.
Unfortunately, the reality has been much different.
Let's start with New York State, which has had such a tax since 1905. Over the next eight decades, the tax was revised up and down nine times, including a large increase in the middle of the Great Depression. In 1966, Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York City ended up raising the tax by 25 percent. It led to an immediate reaction as the New York Stock Exchange threatened to jump across the Hudson River to New Jersey.
In the 1970s, the tax began to be phased out. New York State still collects the tax -- some $14.5 billion annually -- but since 1981, the state has simply returned it to traders instead of keeping it. In other words, the tax is collected and immediately given back, something that can happen only in the strange world of taxes. (Other financial transaction taxes include a federal version, which was put in effect in 1914 to help pay for World War I and eliminated in 1966, and taxes in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania that were also done away with in the 1950s.)
A study of New York State's tax from 1932 to 1981 by Anna Pomeranets and Daniel G. Weaver found that it increased the cost of capital for investors and reduced trading volume. Most important, they found the tax actually increased trading volatility by as much as 10 percent.
Increasing volatility is exactly what advocates of the tax don't want. They want volatility reduced to prevent market disruptions, but the decline in traders in the markets mean fewer buyers and sellers and more price jumps. This finding of increased volatility is in general accord with nine other major papers to study this issue, including studies of the tax in 23 countries, among them Britain, Sweden and Japan. Only one of these papers found that a financial transaction tax reduced volatility.
The New York State tax experience raises a bigger issue -- that of traders just going elsewhere. This problem was mirrored in Sweden.
In 1984, Sweden adopted a financial transaction tax. Some 30 percent to 50 percent of the country's trading volume then shifted to Britain. The lower amount of trading meant that not only did the tax yield less money than predicted but that the country lost more in capital gains taxes than the financial transaction tax raised. The tax was abolished in 1991.
The Swedish and New York State examples show that not only will traders leave to trade elsewhere; the money that people think this tax will reap will not appear, as that trading migrates and volume declines. Japan decided to eliminate its financial transaction tax in 1999 for this reason.
And even if the trading does not shift to other places, financial people are adept at avoiding it. In Britain, for example, where the financial transaction tax has fluctuated from half a percent to 2 percent, the tax has raised significantly less revenue than one might expect, about £3 billion a year. The reason is that investors who trade regularly in Britain use options to avoid the tax, which applies only to trading in stock. The result may be that the tax pushes investors into more risky securities in their efforts to avoid it.
And the reduced volume does not just reduce the amount of revenue collected. It may impose the largest costs on people who cannot afford or avoid the tax. The money management firm BlackRock has calculated that if the financial transaction tax were set at 0.1 percent per trade, an investor putting $10,000 in its global equity fund would lose more than $2,300 in expected returns over a 10-year period. This amount would rise to $15,000 if the money were invested in a more actively managed European fund.
This means not only less in retirement funds, but fewer jobs. Although disputed, one study in 2004 by the Partnership for the City of New York found that if New York State started keeping a tax of 0.25 cents per share traded, it would lose 23,000 to 33,000 jobs for every 10 percent drop in volume and more than $3 billion in lost revenue and economic value, probably more than offsetting the amount it collected.
This is not to say that a financial transaction tax by itself is such a terrible idea. My point is that we already have lots of experience with this kind of tax, and it argues for caution. If you think a financial transaction tax will reduce volatility, then you have to account for the fact that taxes in the past have shown the opposite. And if the tax is not imposed globally, it will force migrations of trading to less regulated places and in more byzantine forms, possibly making the world markets less safe.
As for seeking revenue gains to solve budget problems, if the tax is too small, it will have no effect. But the larger it is -- and the Robin Hood Foundation's proposal is in the large sphere -- the more markets will be affected. It is for these reasons that Canada has rejected such a tax.
Now, we are about to get a real-life case study. France has adopted a 0.2 percent financial transaction tax involving securities of a company with a market capitalization of more than 1 billion euros. The full effects of France's tax are not yet known, but a preliminary study by Credit Suisse, according to The Economist, found that stocks not subject to a tax rose 19 percent by volume, but those affected by the tax declined 16 percent. And the net effect of the tax appears to have shifted trading to smaller stocks not subject to it, distorting the allocation of capital, which is another problem with the tax. And the European Union has proposed a tax for 11 of its member countries, giving us a possible second test.
Instead of rushing into the adoption of a financial transaction tax, it may behoove us to watch and see whether these new taxes in Europe work. And even if the United States plunges ahead, history tells us that any tax should be carefully structured and considered before being put into effect. For there are likely to be many unintended consequences. There's a reason that economists say there is no free lunch.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

ADVOCATING CHANGE A hedge fund run by a former lieutenant of Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor famous for clashing with management, has teamed up with a major real estate developer to push for change at CommonWealth REIT. 
On Tuesday, Keith Meister, founder of Corvex Management and Mr. Icahn's protégé, and Jeff T. Blau, the chief executive of the developer Related Companies, disclosed a 9.8 percent ownership stake in CommonWealth. The investors published a letter they sent to CommonWealth management, along with a 50-page slide presentation that agitates for change at the company, based in Newton, Mass.
Mr. Meister and Mr. Blau said that if management was unwilling to engage in discussions about how to improve the company, they would take further action. PETER LATTMAN
HOMECOMING A former top Morgan Stanley official is coming back to the firm, after a two-year stint at the State Department under Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Morgan Stanley announced on Tuesday that Thomas R. Nides, left, who served as its chief operating officer until early 2011, would return as a vice chairman. In that role, he will have wide-ranging responsibilities covering clients and external and government affairs.
Mr. Nides will report to James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chairman and chief executive, and will work with the heads of Morgan Stanley's core securities and wealth management businesses, Colm Kelleher and Gregory J. Fleming. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED
BULLISH BEHAVIOR The buyout market is showing signs of the excesses that led to the financial crisis, leading private equity managers say.
Speaking at an annual private equity conference in Berlin, Howard S. Marks, chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, said investors continued to pay high prices for companies and were tapping into growing amounts of cheap credit to finance takeovers.
His comments come after a series of recent multibillion-dollar deals, which have raised expectations that debt-fueled buyouts are back. MARK SCOTT

HEADLINE: In Massachusetts We Trust

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Many people look to the Massachusetts health care law as a model of what the nation&#8217;s Affordable Care Act may bring, but the impact on labor markets reflects very different approaches, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
From a labor-market perspective, the Affordable Care Act has little in common with the 2006 health reform law implemented in Massachusetts.
Some employers are complaining about the $2,000 per-employee-per-year penalty they will pay beginning next year when the main provisions of the Affordable Care Act go into effect. The Congressional Budget Office also warned about the astonishing increase in marginal tax rates that middle-income Americans will experience, because the additional income earned by a family will be considered by the Internal Revenue Service as available for additional health insurance payments. 
One might guess that large changes like these would shock the nation's labor markets, especially the markets for less-skilled workers for whom $2,000 is a significant sum, not to mention the costs of health insurance.
The United States Department of Health and Human Services rejects these concerns, saying that the experience in Massachusetts suggests "that the health care law will improve the affordability and accessibility of health care without significantly affecting the labor market," The Washington Examiner reported. The Urban Institute also thinks the Massachusetts results will accurately model the national market.

If there were another country or region that had already tried the federal Affordable Care Act, we would learn a lot from the results, regardless of how much business people might be complaining. However, even though the Affordable Care Act and the Massachusetts law are both forms of "health reform," and both seek to reduce the number of people without health insurance, they are quite different in terms of the labor-market incentives they create.
One of several unique features of the Massachusetts law is that it attempts to leverage the exclusion of employer-provided health insurance from federal personal income tax for the purpose of getting insurance to the previously uninsured. The law encouraged employers to set up a "125 plan" that allows employees to use their own pretax dollars to buy health insurance.
Under a 125 plan, an employer need not pay for employee health insurance: the employer only assists a bit in the administration of the premium payments and withholding. The premium payments themselves come from employee paychecks. And the 125 plans are for employees (who may buy insurance on behalf of their families), not for people without jobs.
Even before the law was passed, Massachusetts employers typically offered some kind of health insurance plan to employees. The state law pushed a significant fraction of the remaining few to try the 125 approach by threatening to bill noncompliant employers for the uncompensated care their employees received around the state, a penalty known as the "free-rider surcharge." So far, studies have found that enough employers took on 125 plans that ultimately no employers were liable for the surcharge.
In contrast, the federal Affordable Care Act attempts to nudge the national labor market away from the federal tax exclusion for employer-provided insurance by offering large subsidies only to people who are not part of an employer plan, including people who are not employed. The act also passes judgment on the affordability of employer plans and penalizes employers who offer "unaffordable" plans and then have employees who receive the subsidies. The federal penalties can reach $3,000 per employee and are not deductible from business taxes.
As long as they do something like the 125 plan to help their employees use the federal tax exclusion, Massachusetts employers are only nominally responsible for the "affordability" of health insurance or for failures of their employees to take advantage of the plan offered. The Massachusetts penalty is only $295 per employee-year (as far as I can tell, it is business tax-deductible, which makes the $295 less than one-tenth of the federal penalty); it can be avoided by an employer that makes nominal contributions to its employees' premiums and induces enough employees to participate.
Perhaps it's wise for the Affordable Care Act to push in a different direction than Massachusetts did, because many economists think the federal personal income tax exclusion promotes health care inefficiencies and diverts much-needed revenue from the United States Treasury.
But that wisdom doesn't change the fact that the federal law will put very different pressures on employers and employees than the Massachusetts law does. It would be unwise to assume that next year's national labor market will follow the patterns that the labor market in Massachusetts experienced after 2006.

HEADLINE: Sweeping Before the Storm

BYLINE: KENNETH ROSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Metropolitan Diary: Helping an elderly man sweep his stairs, with the hope it will help others. 

 BODY:
Dear Diary:
Another storm was approaching when he beckoned for me. Toting a wimpy broom, he stood on the top step of his brownstone - the 10 other steps covered by light coats of snow. His weight shifted onto a cane. He reminded me of the man in East Harlem I'd seen earlier that day. That man sat in his electric wheelchair, one of its motorized wheels caked in mud and spinning like mad, unable to gain traction. 
I was up there for a meeting when I saw the man in his wheelchair in the middle of a path that cut through a housing development near 106th Street. Snow had mostly melted, leaving mud along paths and untended gardens - public space turned to wastelands. When he veered off the path, the right wheel sank into the mud. He tried backing out without effect. He tried again and pulled himself onto the path. But the wheel spun and spun and spun around.
 I walked past him, noting he'd be getting nowhere soon, the meeting and approaching storm still on my mind.
Now, as I stood below the man atop his stoop, I wondered if, like the man in his wheelchair, he'd ever get loose, ever get going down the stairs - if he'd move forward. In passing, I looked up and he called to me.
"Sweep my stairs," he said blankly. I figured I'd help with that.
At the bottom I looked up, only a few feet from where I'd stood minutes before. The steps were cleared of snow now. The street was still quiet except for a passing car. He said thank you and I felt as though I needed to help him, perhaps because I didn't want the second one to get stuck in the coming storm.

HEADLINE: Fight Over Spending Cuts a Prelude to Budget Battles Ahead

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: It may be hard to believe, given the intense partisan strafing ignited by the automatic government spending cuts set to begin on Friday, but this year&#8217;s budget wars have yet to fully get under way. 

 BODY:
It may be hard to believe, given the intense partisan strafing already ignited by the automatic government spending cuts that begin on Friday, but this year's budget wars have yet to get fully under way.
In the next month, Democrats and Republicans, so at odds with one another that they are not even negotiating to avert the across-the-board cuts set to kick in at the end of the week, will have to find a way to agree on spending levels for the remainder of this year. If they fail, they could risk a government shutdown starting March 27, when the current authorization for spending runs out.
From the White House to Capitol Hill, no one claims to have any idea about how things will play out or particular confidence that a crisis can be averted. 
As that drama unfolds, another argument will erupt, over a plan to be presented in mid-March by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee last year, to balance the budget in 10 years through spending cuts far deeper than anything adopted so far. 
Mr. Ryan's task will be made easier because his budget, which the House is likely to adopt largely unchanged as its tax and spending blueprint, will accept as a given the tax increases won by President Obama over Republican objections at the beginning of this year. But to give one indication of the kind of deep spending reductions necessary to achieve balance in a decade, last year's budget plan from Mr. Ryan did not eliminate the deficit until almost 2040.
March will also bring the belated unveiling of Mr. Obama's budget for next year, which will serve as a counterpoint to Mr. Ryan's proposal. To make things even more interesting, the two parties will also take up the first budget plan to be produced by Senate Democrats in four years, forcing vulnerable red-state Democrats into some tough votes.
Then, assuming no flowering of peace, love and understanding in the months following fiscal policy's March Madness, the White House and Congress could then find themselves in July back where they were two years earlier: deeply divided over both long- and short-term budget measures and confronting the need to raise the government's debt ceiling again amid calls from conservatives to use that leverage to further cut spending.
The succession of showdowns mirrors to a great degree those that played out tumultuously in 2011, leading to the ungainly compromise that produced this week's automatic spending cuts.
Two years ago, the unfolding conflicts were a test of the Tea Party movement's ability to drive the Republicans into a more aggressive posture on reducing the size and scope of government.
This time around they are a test of whether Mr. Obama's re-election shifted the political dynamic in Washington in a fundamental way.
Having prevailed in getting a tax hike in January, Mr. Obama is now trying to break a cycle in which conservatives regularly thwart his hopes of a legacy-enhancing bipartisan deal that would bring down the deficit through a combination of further tax increases and cuts to the entitlement programs. And he is still trying, with a notable lack of success so far, to return budget negotiations to a normal legislative process in Congress rather than lurching from one crisis-infused deadline to the next.
"The American public has been very clear that they do not want us to manage this country by crisis," said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, the chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee.
But for the next few weeks and months, brinkmanship could be more the rule than the exception.
At this point, the White House and both parties in Congress expect across-the-board cuts to domestic and military programs to take effect as scheduled on Friday and to remain in force for some relatively extended period.
House Republicans intend to move as early as next week to the next stage of the confrontation. They want to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government operating, probably through the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30.
The measure would authorize discretionary spending of $1.04 trillion - the legal cap for this year - with the understanding that the total would automatically be reduced by the amount of the automatic cuts for this year, effectively yielding a discretionary spending authorization of around $970 billion. House Republicans say the measure is clean and simple, and that if the Democratic-controlled Senate or the White House choose to reject it, then the responsibility for shutting down the government would fall to them.
Senate Democrats and White House officials declined to say exactly how they would respond, preferring to see how votes on a Senate Democratic alternative play out this week. Senate Democrats, saying they want to avoid indiscriminate spending cuts but still achieve the same amount of deficit reduction, have proposed swapping the cuts mandated by the sequester for a package of cuts to farm-subsidy programs and tax increases. That package has little chance of clearing the Senate.
Congress and the administration could have as little as three weeks to sort things out or risk a government shutdown. Congress is scheduled to leave town around March 22 for its spring break; in addition to resolving spending levels for this year, Congressional leaders are hoping to push budget plans for next year through the House and Senate before they leave town.
The experience of the past several years suggests that nothing will truly get settled in the next month. That would kick the big fights - over the composition of spending cuts, the willingness of Republicans to go along with Mr. Obama's demand for further tax increases and the prospects for a long-term deficit reduction deal - into the summer, when the federal government will again reach its legal borrowing limit.
Many analysts say the prospects for a comprehensive deal this summer are no better than they were in 2011, when talks between Mr. Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, collapsed.
"I don't think there's a grand bargain out there - not this year, not next year, maybe not until after 2016," said Stan Collender, a veteran budget analyst.
If that pessimistic view proves correct, the two parties will have to fall back again on temporary measures and gimmicks to avert total fiscal gridlock and the risks of further economic and financial damage to the country - exactly the sequence of events that put them where they are today.

HEADLINE: Putting a Number on Federal Education Spending

BYLINE: JASON DELISLE


HIGHLIGHT: Official tallies of government expenditures on education are often misleading, and a close look shows that education represents about 3 percent of federal spending, a policy analyst writes. 

 BODY:
Jason Delisle is the director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation. 
In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed to expand access to preschool, but offered few details on how much money the federal government would contribute. When the White House eventually releases that figure, everyone will want to know how it stacks up against what the federal government already spends on education each year. The trouble is, that number is tough to pin down.
You might try to look it up. But beware: most tallies, even official government figures, are incomplete or inaccurate because of the way they treat student loans, refundable tax credits and education programs run by agencies other than the United States Department of Education. Other tallies go too far, lumping veterans' education benefits and other programs into the mix. 
Before explaining how to get to a good number, I'll give you mine. The federal government spent $107.6 billion on education in fiscal year 2012. As a point of reference, that sum is about one-eighth as much as Social Security spending and about a fifth of Medicare spending. Most of our national education budget comes from state and local governments. But the $107.6 billion provides a dose of perspective for when federal policy makers pledge to "invest in education" and make education a "top priority." Federal education spending accounts for just 3 percent of the $3.5 trillion the government spent in 2012. 
The figure includes the annual appropriation for the entire Department of Education ($67.4 billion), so-called mandatory spending at the department ($16.3 billion), the school breakfast and lunch programs ($14.8 billion), the refundable portion of a higher education tax credit ($6.6 billion), the Head Start program ($8.0 billion) and the subsidy provided on all of the student loans the government will disburse in one year (which happened to be negative - -$5.5 billion - last year). 
The annual appropriation for the Department of Education is an obvious figure to include, but as you can see, education spending includes a significant amount outside annual appropriations, much of which goes to support the Pell Grant program for college students from low-income families. 
The school meal programs are less obvious components, but should be included. The programs help ensure that more than 31 million children each year do not go hungry at school, a prerequisite for good educational outcomes. Surely when a local district builds a new school it doesn't consider the cafeteria an optional line item tangentially related to the school's purpose. Feeding children during the school day is, in fact, integral to their education. 
Similarly, the Head Start program, although housed in the Department of Health and Human Services, is a national preschool program dedicated to early education. When people think of federal education spending, Head Start often comes to mind. 
The federal government also provides a long list of tax benefits (i.e., credits, exemptions and deductions) to support education. They totaled $33.2 billion in 2012 by one count, but I've excluded them in the spending tally. Experts argue over whether tax benefits are part of federal spending policy or tax policy. No funds leave the Treasury to finance these programs; instead, funds fail to arrive as revenue in the first place. Others argue that the benefits are not different from spending because a $1,000 tax credit has the same bottom-line effect on the federal budget as a $1,000 grant. 
A "refundable tax credit" is, however, a different matter. No one debates the fact that a refundable tax credit is government spending. The recipient owes no taxes but receives a refund check as if he did. He pays negative federal income taxes. Even the Treasury Department treats the payments as "outlays." Last year the government spent $6.6 billion in refundable payments under the America Opportunity Tax Credit, which I include in my measure of education spending. Tax filers can claim up to $1,000 of the credit against expenses for higher education, even if they have no tax liability to offset. 
Finally, the federal government disbursed $112 billion in student loans in 2012. Most of that will be paid back, with interest. So what does the government spend on the loans? The government measures the cost of its loan programs by the subsidy that they provide to the borrower. Put simply, if the government lends at very favorable terms, then the borrower receives a subsidy equal to the discount the borrower received relative to a loan he or she otherwise could have taken out. Even though the benefit is spread over the life of the loan, this calculation treats the subsidy as one lump sum in the year that the loan is made. 
By that measure, official figures show that the government's student loan programs provide negative subsidies, which is to say, interest rates and fees are set high enough that the government makes money. But there is a big flaw with those figures. 
The Congressional Budget Office and many economists argue that official figures don't factor in all of the risks inherent in the loans. In response, the Congressional Budget Office publishes fair-value estimates to more fully reflect risk, and I use those figures in my tally of federal education spending. Note that even after the adjustment, the one year's worth of loans still show a net gain to the government of $5.5 billion. 
Excluded from my tally are any of the education benefits provided through the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. Funds for those programs should be considered military and veterans' spending rather than federal education spending. The benefits are part of the compensation packages that the government provides to support an all-volunteer military. Similarly, a housing allowance for a member of the military is not a federal housing assistance program. The benefits are in-kind costs associated with financing the military. If included, those programs would add more than $10 billion to the $107.6 billion total. 
The $107.6 billion figure, despite excluding military and veterans' programs, reflects a more comprehensive measure of federal education spending than most. Even so, it is probably surprising to many that education spending comes in at just 3 percent of the $3.5 trillion the federal government spent in 2012. It is hardly the figure that comes to mind when a lawmaker or the president speaks of investments and priorities.

HEADLINE: In the Hunt for Capital, Private Equity Executives Outnumber Investors

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Networking at the Super Return conference in Berlin is an exhausting process, as private equity firms set up shop in private rooms, at tables and even at the bar in the conference hotel 

 BODY:
BERLIN - For private equity managers in search of investors, networking at the Super Return conference in Berlin is an exhausting process.
To pitch to potential investors throughout the three-day main event, firms set up shop in private rooms, at tables set apart from the main conference and even at the bar in the conference hotel 
The numbers are not in their favor. More than half of the 1,400 attendees are from private equity firms, while only a quarter are institutional investors and the like. The remainder comes from companies that offer services to the industry.
Hunched over tablets and ring-bound presentations, managers from the European industry giants like Apax and smaller boutique firms try to persuade wary investors to part with their money. The meetings are packed, with investors shuffling from one presentation to another in the hunt for the right firm.
The financial crisis has made fund-raising increasingly difficult.
While private equity raised a combined $312 billion last year, a small increase over 2011, the number of funds that successfully raised capital fell by almost a quarter, to 687, over the same period, according to the data provider Preqin. Still, almost 2,000 firms also are seeking to raise a combined $797 billion.
"Investors are concentrating on fewer managers," Robert D. Brown, head of limited partner services at Advent International, said during one of the many networking breaks at the industry conference in Berlin. "Less capital is going to fewer managers."
Advent, based in Boston, has been one of the success stories. In November, it completed a fund-raising campaign of 8.5 billion euros, or $11.1 billion, which was roughly 20 percent higher than its initial target.
The hunt for capital can often blind managers to what's around them.
At the main conference bar - named after the German-born actress Marlene Dietrich - bar staff complained that some conference participants were overly focused on networking. As such, they had failed to realize the drinks were not included in the $7,500 entry fee and thus were not paying their bar tabs on the first day of the event.
By the second day, however, the waiters had quickly solved the problem. As they delivered the 4 euro coffees to the waiting private equity managers, the bar staff made sure to include the check.

HEADLINE: Will Journalism Go The Way of Whaling?

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins ask how much new media mangle the message. 

 BODY:
 David Brooks: A couple of times a week I walk by the Yale Drama School. It's a strange experience because my dream through college was to go there and become a playwright, a cross between Clifford Odets and George S. Kaufman. When the socialist revolution came I wanted to be the one writing snappy one-liners to support it. Then I gave up that dream and decided to become Herbert Croly, the early New Republic editor, or John Reed, the radical who went to Harvard and then had a love affair with Diane Keaton (at least in "Reds").
 Gail Collins: Herbert Croly - wow. David, I have always admired the fact that your youth was spent fantasizing about being people I had never heard of until I was 30.
 David: Did you have any youthful ambitions to be obsolete cultural figures? 
 Gail: I was in Milwaukee. My friends and I just fantasized about being on a coast.
I did have a brief fling imagining myself part of the Algonquin Round Table, but that ended when I learned that in real time Dorothy Parker was not actually all that much fun to have around.
 David: I mention my nostalgic turn of mind only because I've been thinking a lot about technology and our brains. When I was a reporter in Chicago in the early '80s, we were still on typewriters.
 Gail: I actually remember when we got word processors, and the old guys muttered that you couldn't pound out a story on a computer.
 David: Then about five years ago, I felt we newspaper types were in the whaling business, doomed to die an unseemly death as newspapers succumbed to the inevitable triumph of the blogosphere.
 Gail: And you really do not want to be knocked off by something with that name. It was like a "Star Wars" movie: "Chewy! The ship is being sucked into the Blogosphere."
 David: Now I feel, or maybe it's hope, that we've reached equilibrium. Blogging is real, but not hegemonic. YouTube is interesting for people who enjoy watching 54,000 versions of the Harlem Shake. College students these days seem to spend little time on blogs and not much on Twitter, but a lot of time on Facebook or at least on Instagram. And lo and behold recognizable newspaper journalism is still standing, benefitting from a popular flight to quality.
Do you share my sanguine view that we've reached a survivable equilibrium?
 Gail: I've always had faith that the great national newspapers would survive in some form. But to tell the truth, I've been feeling grimmer and grimmer about local reporting. Candidates for the House and even the Senate campaign with very little coverage. Press rooms in state capitols look like they've been evacuated. And I don't know what happens to national politics when the feeder system is covered mainly by right- and left-wing bloggers.
 David: Good point. I used to tell young journalists to start out writing crime stories somewhere. Now I tell them to produce Web pages that link and comment on the best pieces in the national press. The big editors will look to your site if you write obsessively about them. Eventually they'll hire you.
 Gail: That's a good career strategy, I suppose. Instead of covering the news, you cover the people covering the news.
 David: The next victim of all this technical transformation seems to be the universities. I remain genuinely confused by this transformation. On the one hand, there are studies to suggest that online learning can be as effective as old-fashioned classroom instruction. On the other hand, our colleagues recently published a good editorial that highlight the flaws. People who start online courses rarely finish them, and nobody has been able to flip the classroom - with lectures at home, homework and discussion at school - effectively on a large scale.
The whole thing may be undone by the reality that people learn best from people they care about. Without face-to-face emotional connection, nothing sinks in beyond the next test. Often the students who do best are the ones who make the most appointments to visit their professors during office hours.
 Gail: You know, I have a lot of books on my iPad, but when I try to read them, I find myself wandering off to play games. Those are books I'm interested in. I can't imagine what would have happened to me in college if my biology class had been on the same computer as "Words With Friends" and "Doom."
 David: Now even warfare seems to be going online. We live in an economic system in which the world is seen as a conversation, lots of free and open exchange, where it works best for everybody if we all trust one another.
The new cyber-mercantalists like China and Russia live in a system in which they review international trade as power competition, with cyberattacks and all the rest. It's kind of creepy that they spend so much effort gathering data on our power grid and water systems.
Is it possible brick-and-mortar warfare could be gradually displaced by taking down one another's power grids and Internet connections?
 Gail: The security folk certainly do seem to be freaked out by that possibility. I'm not smart enough about technology to know how conceivable a hacking war would be, but I've seen the movie. Or at least several TV series.
 David: My own view is that people tend to underestimate the pace of technological change but they tend to overestimate the pace of human change. That is, if you go back to past visions of the future as they were displayed in world fairs, for example, they generally fail to anticipate how quickly we will invent things like wireless communication, but they always imagine that social structures will change faster than they actually do. They imagine people living without nuclear families, without dysfunctional political squabbles. They imagine that technology will streamline and rationalize social institutions. That never happens.
 Gail: I did some research once on the way people in the past imagined the year 2000. They tended to picture the things they already had getting more sophisticated - flying cars, self-cleaning windows. And the folks in the early 1900s had a wildly optimistic estimate of the future of pneumatic tubes. But very few envisioned the kind of life-changing leaps we've experienced.
This is the moment when I should also admit that when the Internet first arrived I kept telling people it was a fad.
 David: Amazing. I said the same thing about the Pet Rock, and now when I look around there are rocks everywhere. There are even really tall ones in Colorado and Montana.
 Gail: Besides all the obvious stuff, the Internet is changing the way we communicate through writing. When the simple word processors came in, writing became crisper, less dense - just because of the way we could instantly edit on the screen. Now the ability to mash up words and pictures and links and songs and tweets is what matters. I can't imagine what writing will be like in 2154.
 David: My general rule is that technology supplements but doesn't replace. Supplement newspapers but not replace. Supplement the traditional dorm and seminar college but not replace, supplement regular warfare but not replace. As others have pointed out, the radio didn't go away with the TV, and the TV hasn't even gone away with the laptop.
That's good for those of us with one foot in the past.
 Gail: And you still can't pound out a story on a smartphone.

HEADLINE: History Shadows an Upbeat Music Sales Forecast

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: For those who have seen the industry&#8217;s optimism dashed before, an upbeat report on Tuesday by its global trade body, the International Federation for the Phonographic Industry, brought hope and skepticism. 

 BODY:
In early 2004, Billboard magazine ran a cover story with a hopeful headline: "Have Sales Finally Hit Bottom?"
The answer, as anyone who has paid attention to the music industry knows, was a most definite no. Aside from a couple of positive blips along the way, the recorded music business - shaken by digital media, the Internet and the loss of thousands of record stores - has been in precipitous decline for more than a decade.
So for those who have seen the industry's optimism dashed before, an upbeat report on Tuesday by its global trade body, the International Federation for the Phonographic Industry brought hope and skepticism. According to the report, the trade (or wholesale) value of global recorded music sales in 2012 was $16.5 billion, up 0.3 percent from the year before, the international market's first year-over-year gain since 1999. 
Digital music was responsible for much of that growth, such as it is. In developed markets like the United States, people are buying more digital files and starting to subscribe in significant numbers to streaming services like Spotify. (They are also getting less and less music through unauthorized peer-to-peer networks, according to another report on Tuesday by the NPD Group, a consumer-research firm.) These services are also rapidly spreading overseas. "Major" ones like iTunes, Spotify and Deezer are now available in more than 100 countries, up from 23 just two years ago, according to the I.F.P.I., while some countries, like Kenya and Vietnam, saw their first digital music services open last year.
"Digital is saving music," said Edgar Berger, Sony Music's international chief.
Those trends are all positive, and if they continue they could allow the music industry to earn money in areas once thought completely spoiled by piracy. But despite this good news, there are still some possible problems, as well as questions about how the new digital economy will work.

One issue is the future of of CDs, which still represent the majority of sales (and industry revenue) around the world; in Japan, for example, the world's second-largest music market, CD sales are actually growing. But these are under threat from the loss of stores like the HMV chain in Britain, which recently entered bankruptcy proceedings, and from shrinking shelf space at brick-and-mortar stores everywhere.
And while the I.F.P.I.'s report trumpets Sweden, Norway and India as exemplary digital markets, it is unclear what the rest of the world could learn from them. India's legitimate music sales are a tiny fraction of its overall entertainment spending, in large part because of piracy, and as Glenn Peoples at Billboardhas pointed out, Norway's population is about the size of Kentucky's.
The popularity of digital music services itself poses some difficulties. In the United States, rising competition and thin operating margins could force subscription services to reduce their prices from the current standard of about $10 a month; according to some reports, Spotify may already be pushing for this in its latest round of label negotiations. Lower prices could help these services attract millions of new customers, but they would likely also further reduce royalties, an issue that has drawn serious concern among artists and their advocates.
So what does it mean to "save" the music industry? Few expect the business to ever return to the salad days of 1999, when worldwide trade revenue was about $29 billion, and the world had just seen the arrival of the peer-to-peer system Napster. Many artists have long since adapted to the idea that recordings will no longer be their biggest source of income, even if they may be the foundation around which the artists build a more diversified career.
For the record industry, it may be too soon to declare victory. But the I.F.P.I.'s report, along with other data and analysis, make a decent argument that the bleeding has at least been stanched. The industry's challenge is to expand digital services more quickly and more profitably than the rate at which CD sales die out, and it looks as though that has finally been achieved.
Yet another report on Tuesday gave a glimpse of how success might look. The report, by the British media research firm Enders Analysis, had a rosy title: "U.S. Recorded Music Gets Some Mojo." It said that music sales "touched bottom" last year and projected that retail sales in the United States, estimated at $5.3 billion last year, would reach $5.7 billion by 2016, a growth of 7.5 percent over four years.
That may be billions less than the industry was making at its peak. But at least it is not less than it makes now.

HEADLINE: Union Leaders Call for Repeal of Automatic Spending Cuts

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: With President Obama and Congressional Republicans making little progress toward reaching a budget deal, the nation&#8217;s union leaders on Wednesday began pushing a new proposal to prevent the looming cuts: immediately repeal the sequestration law. 

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. - With President Obama and Congressional Republicans making little progress toward reaching a budget deal, the nation's union leaders on Wednesday began pushing a new proposal to prevent the automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration: immediately repeal the law that put them in place. 
At the annual winter meeting of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council, labor leaders - alarmed that large-scale cuts and layoffs would begin on Friday - abandoned their previous call for Congress to embrace a balanced approach toward reducing the deficit. Instead, the labor leaders said repealing the sequestration law was the best route to prevent what labor leaders fear will be disastrous cuts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of layoffs, many of them unionized government workers at the federal, state and local levels.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of 57 labor unions, has strongly backed Mr. Obama in his standoff with the Republicans. The labor federation has taken an approach diametrically opposed to the Republicans - it has said the $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction should be done totally by increasing taxes on the wealthy and on corporations. Having agreed to a tax increase on the wealthy in the last round of deficit talks, Republicans have said they want all deficit reduction now done through spending cuts. 
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. attacked the Republican approach, accusing Congressional Republicans of engaging in hostage-taking. 
"Republicans in Congress once again are threatening to harm the economy unless Democrats agree to cut Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits," the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council said in a unanimously backed statement. "We urge President Obama and members of Congress of both parties to reject the Republican ransom demands and disarm the hostage takers instead. Only then can we focus on the urgent challenge of fixing the economy, raising wages, investing in our people and putting America back to work.
The federation's executive council then added: "The solution is to disarm the hostage-takers so they no longer can hold the economy hostage to get their way. Disarming the hostage takers means repealing 'sequestration' - not replacing it. Across-the-board cuts would increase unemployment and harm the economy, but so would replacement cuts of the same size."
Republican leaders say that budget cuts are needed to reduce a dangerously large deficit. They resist further tax increases on the grounds that they would slow economic growth and discourage job creation.

HEADLINE: The Economics of Visual Effects

BYLINE: MELENA RYZIK


HIGHLIGHT: With visual effects firms under great financial strain, their artists are protesting their working conditions and the loss of jobs. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - There's a high-stakes fight brewing here, between the digital artists who create the movie-magic effects that many blockbusters depend on and the studios that employ them. Audiences got a taste of it on Sunday, when Bill Westenhofer, a visual effects winner for "Life of Pi," was played off the Oscar stage with the "Jaws" music, just as he was talking about the bankruptcy of the film's effects house, Rhythm & Hues. 
In a related protest, more than 400 people, many of them laid-off Rhythm & Hues workers, demonstrated just a few blocks from the theater where the Oscars were taking place, voicing their grievances against the industry. According to Deadline.com, they protested working conditions (long hours without equivalent pay) and the foreign subsidies that draw jobs overseas. Some talked of unionizing. A plane bearing the banner ""BOXOFFICE + BANKRUPT = VISUAL EFFECTS VFXUNION.COM" was scheduled to fly over the Dolby Theater during the Oscars red carpet. 
Rhythm & Hues is not the only casualty of the business. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the German company Pixomondo, which won an Oscar for "Hugo" last year, is closing its London offices because of financial strain, and shutting its Detroit office in November. At a time when the entertainment industry is sustained by tentpole movies driven by visual effects, it seems bewildering that so many are floundering. (The site Before VFX illustrates what blockbusters would look like without the digital add-ons.)
Many thought that playing off Mr. Westenhofer was poor form, especially after an introduction by the cast of the effects-heavy "Avengers."
 "It's particularly galling that the FX guy, speaking about a protest that was happening outside that directly addresses the financial realities that are starting to damage the FX community in a way they may not be able to fully recover from, was cut short at a ceremony where they actually had a computer-animated character give away an award on live television," Drew McWeeny, an editor at HitFix, wrote. 
In an interview in the press room at the ceremony, Mr. Westenhofer elaborated on his speech.
"The visual effects are definitely in a challenging position right now, and we've got to figure out how to make this business model work, because there are artists that are struggling right now," he said. "And I wanted to point out that we aren't technicians. Visual effects is not just a commodity that's being done by people pushing buttons. We're artists, and if we don't find a way to fix the business model, we start to lose the artistry. If anything, 'Life of Pi' shows that we're artists and not just technicians."
Backstage, Ang Lee, the best director winner for "Life of Pi," also took up the cause of the effects workers. "I refuse to think those are technicians that work, hundreds of them work by the computers. We create something that's visual art," he said. "The bad news, it's too expensive. It's very hard."
"Once it gets cheaper and easier," he added, "more filmmakers are going to dive into that and create something more and more interesting. And that language will establish the audience in the future."

HEADLINE: Private Equity's Tax-Advantaged Rivals

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER SWANN


HIGHLIGHT: Master limited partnerships received a tax break decades ago when United States oil production was declining. Now, with oil output booming, is this a wasteful subsidy? 

 BODY:
American buyout barons have new tax-dodge rivals: master limited partnerships. 
The low tax rates on private equity bosses' so-called carried interests save them $1.3 billion a year, according to the United States Treasury, an advantage critics want wiped out. But new data show investors in energy partnerships are now costing Uncle Sam a similar amount thanks to an outdated Internal Revenue Service perk from the 1980s. Both loopholes should be closed. 
Lobbyists for master limited partnerships have claimed that the sector's exemption from corporate income tax costs the Treasury Department about $300 million annually. But as the sector has grown, so has the amount the Treasury Department misses out on. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says that the annual bill will reach $1.6 billion by 2016. That's a big enough chunk of change to attract the attention of deficit hawks in Congress.
Given the sector's expansion, the tax cost of master limited partnerships is likely to rise further. Since the start of 2006, the market value of the top 50 partnerships has climbed fourfold to around $312 billion - far outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index along the way - and the number of master limited partnerships over all has nearly doubled. The tax break has also encouraged the sector to spread beyond its roots in pipelines into oil refining and even mining the sand used in hydraulic fracturing.
The exemption for master limited partnerships may have looked sensible when it was adopted in 1987 to help stem declining United States oil production. With oil output booming and master limited partnerships starting to sprawl, it now seems a wasteful subsidy. Supporters argue that taking away the break would slow energy production and infrastructure building. But just as private equity chiefs are unlikely to cut back their activities if forced to pay somewhat higher taxes, there are still adequate economic returns available on energy-related activities without extra help from the I.R.S.
Scrapping both tax perks would only bring in about $3 billion a year - around 0.4 percent of the $845 billion budget deficit forecast by the Congressional Budget Office. But it would be a start, with little downside. And with a shortfall this big, every little counts.
