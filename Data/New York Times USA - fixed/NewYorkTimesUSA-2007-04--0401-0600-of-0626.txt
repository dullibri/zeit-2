HEADLINE: Europe Finds Its Own Answer to Bangalore, And It's Growing Fast

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PRAGUE 

 BODY:
Fillip Pejfar works in a sparkling new office tower here on the western edge of the Czech capital, using high-resolution scanners to enter accounting material into the computing systems of Accenture, the global business consulting group. 
 Mr. Pejfar's bookkeeping is not helping Czech clients. His expertise is meant for companies like the French chemical giant Rhodia and the big German software group SAP.
Prague is turning into a center for outsourcing white-collar jobs like bookkeeping, data crunching and even research and development. The Czech Republic and other Central European countries like Poland, Hungary and Slovakia are clamoring to serve the needs of multinational corporations -- and themselves. 
 The United States may turn to India to fill many of its call-center jobs and the like. But Western Europe is turning more frequently these days to its own backyard, transforming a few urban centers of the former Communist bloc into the Bangalores of Europe. 
 American companies are cashing in as well. In recent years, I.B.M., Dell and Morgan Stanley, among others, have outsourced services to Eastern Europe, or helped other American companies do so. 
 To be sure, Eastern Europe, with an outsourcing business estimated at about $2 billion this year, represents just a fraction of the global outsourcing market, estimated this year at nearly $386 billion. But Robert H. Brown, an outsourcing analyst at Gartner Dataquest, expects growth in Eastern Europe to outstrip the rest of the market in the next four years, expanding close to 30 percent by 2010, compared with 25 percent for the global market.
 What is unusual about Eastern and Central Europe is that their most advanced cities offer a potent mix of attributes that even Bangalore cannot rival: a highly educated, multilingual pool of talent in an increasingly affluent consumer market -- all barely a stone's throw from its prime clients. 
 Outsourcing is booming as this region moves more quickly to integrate itself economically with its more affluent neighbors to the west, reflecting progress that is reducing the high unemployment that plagued these countries for years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet empire.
 It is also feeding a real estate boom in high-rise office space. Despite high unemployment in much of Europe, Western European companies are pressed by labor shortages in several important occupations, encouraging them to turn to their eastern neighbors to ease the strain. 
 ''Yes, there is a trend, and it started a few years ago,'' said Miroslaw Proppe, the director for the Warsaw office of KPMG, the accounting firm. He added that it was ''not necessarily based on low labor costs, but on the potential of young Polish graduates.'' Commerzbank of Germany does its data processing in Prague, and Siemens, the electrical giant, does bookkeeping, research and development here. Philips, the Dutch electrical conglomerate, operates a shared services center outside Warsaw. 
 Last summer, Morgan Stanley announced that it was opening a business services and technology center in Budapest that would supplement a mathematical research center the company established there in 2005. 
 The company employs about 200 people there, said Hugh Fraser, a spokesman, and will employ about 450 when fully up and running. He said the choice of Budapest in both cases was made because of the ''availability of high-quality talent.''
 The reasons for Central Europe's new attractiveness for outsourcing are not limited to promising talent at cheap prices. Central and Eastern European countries also remain some of the world's great untapped markets for services and consumer goods. 
 But there is no doubt that low wages in the region appeal to Western companies. Employees in Hungary and the Czech Republic earn a quarter of what employees in Western Europe make; Slovakia's pay runs only a fifth as much, the statistical agency Eurostat says. 
 If that does not make the region attractive enough, governments also offer incentives like simplified tax structures and subsidies for office construction.
 Unlike other regions that compete for outsourcing work, like India or the Philippines, where English is the sole operating language, employees in Accenture's Central European business speak a variety of languages, giving clients access to people who speak English, French, German, Russian and local languages. 
 ''The key thing is language,'' said Andrew Grech, an Australian native who directs Accenture's operations here. ''The other factor is a stable political and economic environment. The Czechs are in the European Union and NATO.'' 
 The growth of these jobs is helping stanch a hemorrhaging of workers from Central and Eastern Europe to the West in search of jobs. And it is exerting some influence on decreasing the unemployment rate across Eastern Europe, Mr. Proppe said. 
 In the Czech Republic, unemployment fell by the start of this year to 7.1 percent from 7.8 percent in 2002; in Poland, joblessness dropped to 13.4 percent from 20.2 percent five years ago; and in Slovakia, to 11.6 percent from 19.7 percent, according to Eurostat. 
 In Hungary, however, the unemployment rate rose, despite an increase in outsourcing jobs, to 8.2 percent from 5.8 percent, mostly because of government austerity measures to cut jobs in the public sector.
 Growth has been strong. Accenture will not disclose its total employment in this country, but the Rhodia account alone employs more than 110 people, and the firm occupies 13 stories in an 18-story skyscraper, plus two stories in an adjacent building. A fourth building is scheduled to go up in the new corporate park, and Accenture plans to take some of that space, too.
 Since entering the Czech Republic in 2001, Accenture has expanded to the city of Brno, the Slovak capital of Bratislava and Budapest. Last year, it opened offices in Warsaw and Bucharest, the capital of Romania. 
 ''We're mostly serving Western European clients,'' Mr. Grech said. He said those clients were increasingly interested in expanding the types of service they received, including bookkeeping and accounting, and computer and personnel services. The growth has come so fast that shortages are arising for specialists in finance and computer services, giving rise to recruiting services in Prague and elsewhere. 
 Three years ago, Ilona Jankovich started a recruiting firm in Budapest to find employees for Western companies moving services to Central Europe. 
 ''I had Hungarian roots,'' said Ms. Jankovich, a lawyer by training whose father fled Hungary for the Netherlands after the unsuccessful 1956 uprising. ''I wanted to come home, and I saw a need for professional recruitment services. Many new companies are coming in, and they all need people.'' 
 The firm, called ProfiPower, has 35 employees and continues to expand. Ms. Jankovich's brother, Bela Jankovich, 39, recently joined and is working to spread the business into Romania. 
 As the reservoir of capable labor in Central Europe dries up, companies are looking as far east as Ukraine. ''We have a regional vision,'' Mr. Jankovich said. With many of the countries of Central Europe now in the European Union, barriers to migration have been reduced. But most Western European countries still maintain hurdles to migrants.
 So instead of the people moving to jobs in Western Europe, the jobs are moving here. In 2004, when SAP chose to move accounting and personnel services to Prague, the company could hire five employees for the price of one in Germany. By now, the difference is down to 3.5 to 1, but SAP is still expanding, expecting to increase its work force to 450 by the end of this year from about 350 now. The wave of outsourcing is raising sticky questions among Western European white-collar workers and their union representatives. In 2005, when Unilever announced that it was seeking to outsource its Western European accounting, personnel and computer activities to Eastern Europe, company employees responded to calls from German labor leaders for a one-day walkout, fearing that as many as 4,000 jobs would be lost.
 Last year, Unilever awarded lucrative contracts for the outsourcing to I.B.M. and Accenture, but assured the unions that jobs in the West would be eliminated only through attrition or voluntary job changes.
 Union leaders remain skeptical. ''Until now it has not been a major problem,'' said Jorg Reinbrecht, who is responsible for financial service employees at Verdi, a German union that represents many white-collar workers. ''But I think it will grow larger as Europewide banks and financial service companies form.'' 
 But for all the concerns of union leaders, business executives say that such outsourcing often offers benefits to both sides of the equation.
 ''You cannot view it negatively,'' said Bernard Bauer, the director of the Czech-German Chamber of Commerce. ''It means a market for many companies -- after all, there are 12 million people in the Czech Republic alone.'' 
 The location here also serves Western companies as a springboard to markets further east, he said, pointing to more slowly developing Romania, with its 22 million people; Bulgaria, with a population of 7.5 million; and one day, perhaps, even Ukraine, with 47 million people.
 The movement, though, may be limited by the future availability of skilled workers in the countries that are now home to outsourcing.
 ''We may face an enormous shortage of qualified personnel,'' Mr. Bauer said.

HEADLINE: Atomic Agency Confirms Advances by Iran's Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
Iran has now begun enriching small amounts of uranium in more than 1,300 centrifuges at a newly opened underground site at its main nuclear complex, the International Atomic Energy Agency's top inspector said Wednesday.
 The information, contained in a letter from the inspector to Iran, provided the first official confirmation of Iran's boast that the country had made significant technical progress in recent weeks, in defiance of United Nations' resolutions aimed at curbing the Iranian nuclear program.
The details of Iran's progress that were spelled out in the letter, obtained through a European diplomat, lend some credence to Iran's contention that it will soon have installed 3,000 of the centrifuges, which can be used to provide nuclear fuel to power reactors, or can produce fuel for a weapon. 
 If Iran can get that many centrifuges running, experts say, it could possibly produce enough fuel for a weapon within about a year. But so far there is no evidence that Iran is enriching the nuclear material at the level needed to produce a weapon, and American officials said the amount of fuel now being fed into the system was so small that it might simply indicate that the Iranians were trying a test run with the delicate machinery. 
 In the past, Iran has had tremendous difficulty keeping all the machines spinning together in what is known as a cascade, a process that results in enriched uranium.
 The confirmation came in a confidential letter sent by the agency's deputy director general and its chief inspector, Olli Heinonen, to a top Iranian official complaining that inspectors had not been given sufficient access to some Iranian facilities.
 By moving forward with the assembly of the centrifuges, the Iranian government is in a contest of wills with the United Nations Security Council, which has demanded full suspension of the enrichment program. This month, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned that if the West did not end pressure on Iran to halt uranium production, Iran would consider halting cooperation with the agency. He said that the West ''should know that the Iranian nation will defend its right and that this path is irreversible.''
 In private, some American officials say Iran's hand may be strengthened by its calculation that, with the United States distracted across the border in Iraq, Mr. Bush has no stomach for a confrontation. White House officials say that is a misreading of Mr. Bush's mind, and that the United States plans to increase gradually the severity of sanctions against Iran, in the hope that it will prompt pressure on Mr. Ahmadinejad and other hard-liners in the government. 
 On Wednesday evening, Gordon Johndroe, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said that ''the I.A.E.A.'s letter to Iran shows the Iranian government continues to defy the international community.'' 
 ''The letter also indicates that Iran is obstructing the I.A.E.A.'s inspection requests,'' Mr. Johndroe added. ''While the government of Iran sees this as an advance, this is unfortunately a step backward for the Iranian people.'' 
 He added that ''Iran looks like it may be headed for additional resolutions'' at the United Nations.
 The Security Council announced a new set of sanctions in March, and gave Iran 60 days to comply. But at the speed at which Iran's workers are installing centrifuges, diplomats and outside experts say, it is possible that Iran will have many more cascades operating by the time the agency is supposed to issue its next report on the status of the Iranian effort, in late May.
 Iran's decision to deploy the centrifuges appears to be a victory, at least for now, for hard-liners in the government who have warned that to suspend uranium enrichment would be a surrender to the United States and Europe. But American officials have been hoping to use each Iranian announcement to prompt Russia and China, which have been most resistant to severe sanctions, to agree to a series of tougher resolutions.

HEADLINE: Bush Presses Sudan on Darfur, Citing Possible U.S. Sanctions

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
President Bush invoked the powerful imagery of the Holocaust on Wednesday to intensify pressure on Sudan, warning that the United States would impose stiff economic sanctions and seek others from the United Nations if President Omar Hassan al-Bashir does not bring a quick end to the brutal violence in Darfur.
 ''The time for promises is over -- President Bashir must act,'' Mr. Bush said, speaking at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. ''The world needs to act. If President Bashir does not meet his obligations to the United States of America, we'll act.'' 
But Mr. Bush stopped short of imposing sanctions immediately, a step that people inside and outside the administration who have been working on the issue said he had been prepared to take just days ago. 
 In the end, officials said, Mr. Bush bowed to pleas from the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who called Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Tuesday to ask for more time to negotiate with Mr. Bashir. Mr. Ban also raised the issue directly with the president last week. The White House made it clear that Mr. Bush was skeptical that those negotiations would succeed. 
 ''He's very frustrated about this,'' one senior administration official said of Mr. Bush, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations. ''We've seen a pattern of agreements made and never carried out, commitments to facilitate made and what we get is obstruction.''
 Mr. Bush has been trying to come up with a way to end what his administration has said it regards as genocide in Darfur, in western Sudan, where 200,000 people have been killed and more than 2.5 million displaced. His comments on Wednesday were the sharpest in a string of American warnings to the government in Khartoum over the past year.
 He said he would give Mr. Bashir ''a short period of time'' -- Mr. Bush was not specific, but administration officials put the time frame at several weeks -- to agree to a full deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces; to end his support for the janjaweed, the militias that have been carrying out systematic killings of civilians in Darfur; and to allow aid to reach the region.
 If Mr. Bashir does not comply, Mr. Bush said that he would direct the Treasury Department to block any dollar transactions between the Sudanese government and the United States, and to bar 29 Sudanese companies from doing business here. He said he would also impose sanctions against individuals responsible for the violence and direct Ms. Rice to seek new United Nations sanctions.
 Some of the advocates for peace in Darfur, who have long criticized the administration for inaction, expressed severe disappointment that he did not take stronger action. Still, some said the specter of the president laying out a specific plan for sanctions against Sudan to an audience of Holocaust survivors -- including Elie Wiesel, an author and Nobel Peace Prize winner -- signaled a new level of intensity.
 ''The president has now embarked on a new phase,'' Mr. Wiesel said after the speech. Asked if he thought the action was too late, he said: ''I am a Jew who believes in daily miracles. When such a miracle occurs, rather than saying 'Why so late?' I am thankful that it is done.''
 Bush administration officials said last month that they were fed up with Sudan's refusal to permit the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers in the country and that the president was ready to impose the kind of sanctions he outlined Wednesday. Andrew S. Natsios, the United States special envoy to Sudan, recently shared the proposal -- which the administration calls Plan B -- with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
 Then, on Monday, Sudan announced that it had dropped its objections to letting a 3,000-member United Nations force of military police officers and six attack helicopters into Darfur. The move, the second stage of a process aimed at getting a total force of 21,000 peacekeepers into the region, came just as a confidential United Nations study found that Sudan was flying arms and heavy equipment into Darfur in planes painted white, apparently to masquerade as United Nations jets.
 Those developments, coupled with the pleas from Mr. Ban, forced the White House on Tuesday to reconsider Mr. Bush's long-planned speech. Officials were still working out the precise language Tuesday evening. 
 Mr. Ban, in Rome on an official visit, said through a spokeswoman that he appreciated Mr. Bush's statement. And at the United Nations, ambassadors from China, Russia and South Africa said the Sudanese announcement persuaded them that this was not the time for sanctions.
 ''Why do we have to be so negative?'' said Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador. 
 Mr. Bush has been under political pressure from human rights advocates at home to act. But the speech came as a shock to the advocates, who had been advised earlier in the week by the State Department and the White House Office of Political Affairs that they would like what they heard. 
 Even so, Larry Rossin, an official with the Save Darfur Coalition, an umbrella group representing an alliance of faith-based and advocacy organizations, said he was heartened that the president had put Plan B in his own words. 
 ''Plan B, which has been around for months but has always been kind of hidden, is now public,'' he said, ''and it's not merely public out of the mouth of Andrew Natsios, but it's out of the mouth of the president of the United States before a bunch of Holocaust survivors, and us. It's on the record now, and they are on the hook.''

HEADLINE: Bombs Rip Through Baghdad in Wave of Attacks, Killing 171

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE; Reporting was contributed by Edward Wong and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Baghdad, David S. Cloud from Tel Aviv, and Iraqi employees of The Times from Baquba and Mosul.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, April 18 

 BODY:
Bombs ravaged Baghdad in five horrific explosions aimed mainly at Shiite crowds on Wednesday, killing at least 171 people in the deadliest day in the capital since the American-led security plan for the city took effect two months ago. 
 The wave of attacks, four of them involving car bombs, took place as Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki declared that the Iraqi government planned to take full control of security from the American-led forces before the end of the year.
In the worst of the bombings, a car packed with explosives exploded at an intersection in the Sadriya neighborhood that serves as a hub for buses traveling to the Shiite district of Sadr City. The blast killed at least 140 people and wounded 150; incinerated scores of vehicles, including several minibuses full of passengers; and charred nearby shops, witnesses and the police said. 
 Mr. Maliki said in a statement late Wednesday that he had ordered the arrest of an Iraqi Army officer who had security oversight in the Sadriya neighborhood. As rescuers thronged the site, a sniper opened fire on the crowd, killing at least one person and wounding two others. 
 ''The blast threw me to the ground and shattered a window over my body,'' said Salar Kamal Zari, a 37-year-old teacher visiting from Kurdistan, who had just stepped into a nearby store when the bomb exploded. ''I saw a human head in front of the store and many cars burning and smoke everywhere.'' 
 ''I will never stay in Baghdad anymore,'' he vowed.
 The Baghdad security plan calls for 28,000 additional American troops, as well as thousands of Iraqi soldiers, most of whom will be deployed in the streets of the violent capital in an attempt to pacify it. But Mr. Maliki said the gradual transfer to Iraqi authority would continue, with three provinces in the relatively tranquil region of Kurdistan the next to come under Iraqi security authority, followed by Karbala and Wasit Provinces in the south. 
 ''In this way, province by province, we will reach the end of the line before the end of the year,'' the prime minister said in a speech delivered by Mowaffak al-Rubaie, his national security adviser. The speech observed the transfer of the southern province of Maysan from British to Iraqi control. Maysan is the fourth of Iraq's 18 provinces to be handed to Iraqi security forces.
 American commanders have said that the Baghdad security effort has reduced the kinds of sectarian killings associated with Shiite death squads, in part because of the decision by many militia fighters to lay low. But the plan has failed to curb the spectacular attacks, many of them suicide bombings, that have become a gruesome hallmark of the Sunni Arab-led insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. As a result, commanders say, overall civilian casualty rates are actually higher now than they were before the plan was initiated. 
 ''As we've said before, it's going to be a tough fight,'' said Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, an American military spokesman. But, he added, ''The plan is not even fully implemented yet.''
 Two American brigades -- a total of about 7,000 soldiers -- are still scheduled to arrive in Iraq and join three other brigades that have poured into the capital and surrounding areas, he said. American commanders say their strategy to prevent these sorts of attacks focuses on rooting out insurgent redoubts in predominantly Sunni towns and villages on the capital's periphery, or what they call ''the Baghdad belts.'' 
 ''A high-priority mission is finding these car bomb factories and getting rid of them, and capturing and killing the terrorists who make the bombs,'' Colonel Garver said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Because of the complexity of building a car bomb -- the process can require a near-complete dismantling of the vehicle -- most are probably made in sparsely populated areas where the work can be more easily concealed, the American commanders say. 
 Wednesday's attacks risked reawakening the dormant Shiite militias, especially the Mahdi Army of Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and reigniting the cycles of sectarian violence that tormented Baghdad after the bombing of a revered Shiite shrine in Samarra in February 2006.
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said the Sunni insurgency's intent was to provoke more sectarian violence. ''We can only hope that the Shia will have the confidence in their government and in the coalition that we'll go after the people that perpetrated this horror,'' he told reporters in Tel Aviv after meeting with Israel's defense minister, Amir Peretz.
 Officials in Mr. Sadr's office in Sadr City would not comment Wednesday on whether the bombing campaign would provoke a resurgence of the Mahdi Army, though they declared that the continuing attacks underscored the failure of the security plan. ''The security situation is worsening,'' said Abdul Mehdi Mutayri, one of the top political officers for Mr. Sadr's organization. ''The security plan might have been declared a success in the media, but it has failed on the ground.'' 
 The Sadriya bombing recalled an attack near the same spot on Feb. 3, when a truck bombing killed at least 137 people, wounded 305 and obliterated a popular market. Mr. Maliki said in a statement that he had ordered the arrest of the commander of the Iraqi Army's Second Battalion, Second Brigade, ''because of the repetition of tragedy in the Sadriya district, showing the weakness of the security planning to protect civilians.''
 After the blast on Wednesday, scores of residents from the neighborhood gathered at the site to gawk at the wreckage, mourn the victims and shout imprecations. ''Oh God, what did they do?'' a man yelled. Women standing on a balcony overlooking the intersection beat their chests in a traditional sign of grief.
 In the mayhem that ensued, even more people died. A sniper opened fire on the crowd, killing at least one person and wounding two others. The shots appeared to come from the adjoining neighborhood of Fadhel, which is predominantly Sunni Arab.
 Rahim Rahim Karim Hmait, a 43-year-old taxi driver, said he tried to evacuate several wounded people to the hospital. But as he approached an army patrol at high speed, soldiers, perhaps thinking he was a suicide bomber, opened fire on his taxi. He was hit in the abdomen, leg and hand, he said. ''I lost control and the car smashed into one of the shops,'' he said in an interview at a hospital in Sadr City, where he was taken for care. ''Some of the wounded people died inside the car.'' 
 Earlier in the afternoon, a suicide car bomber detonated himself near an Iraqi police checkpoint at an entrance to Sadr City, home to more than 1.5 million people, mostly Shiites. The explosion ripped through a bottleneck of vehicles and pedestrians waiting to pass through the checkpoint, killing at least 17 people and wounding at least 45, an Interior Ministry official said. 
 In another attack, a parked car packed with explosives exploded on a busy shopping street in the predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Karada, killing at least 10 people and wounding at least 13, according to the Interior Ministry official. The blast also damaged a nearby private hospital and several other buildings. 
 In Saidiya, a mixed neighborhood in western Baghdad, a car bomb killed two people and wounded eight, including three police officers, the official said. A bomb on a minibus detonated as the bus passed through the Shiite district of Rusafa in central Baghdad, killing at least two people and wounding five, the police said.
 In the district of Uaireej, south of Baghdad, a suicide car bomber detonated himself near a police patrol, killing two police officers and wounding four people, including two police officers and two civilians, the Interior Ministry official said. 
 In another attack, a vehicle belonging to a private security detail exploded in the parking lot outside the entrance to the highly secure complex that includes Baghdad International Airport and the main military base of the American command, coalition security officials said. There were no reports of casualties. According to the security officials, the vehicle pulled into the lot, its occupants got out, and the car blew up. The blast tossed the vehicle onto the roof of a neighboring car, according to the officials, igniting both vehicles and snarling traffic around the airport for the entire day. 
 In Diyala Province, a government security official said Wednesday that 19 insurgents and 2 policemen were killed in heavy clashes on Sunday between Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and the Iraqi security forces in the villages of Al Mohola and Albosbaa, about 12 miles northeast of Baquba. 
 Fighting between government security forces and insurgents in Muqtadiya, north of Baquba, ended in the death of three insurgents and the arrest of four others, the security official said. Another Iraqi soldier was killed by gunmen in Khalis, northeast of Baghdad. 
 In Mosul, fighting between insurgents and the Iraqi Army and police killed six police officers, one soldier and a civilian, according to Brig. Saeed Abdullah al-Jubouri, a spokesman for the provincial police in Nineveh Province.

HEADLINE: In Nod to Consumer Tastes, Nissan to Sell Cleaner Cars

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
Nissan Motor will offer its flagship Maxima sedan with a cleaner-burning diesel engine in the United States by 2010, the company's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said on Wednesday, offering new details of a plan intended to resonate with environmentally conscious consumers and help Nissan meet new emissions rules.
 The timing of Nissan's announcement and a visit here by Mr. Ghosn to meet with lawmakers and lobbyists -- coming as the auto industry faces the possibility of stiffer environmental regulations -- suggests that the automaker is looking to polish its image as a green company. 
Nissan, which would not be the first automaker to offer cleaner diesel technology in the United States, has been slower than other Japanese automakers in developing green technology. While Toyota and Honda have sold gasoline-electric hybrid models for years, Nissan did not begin selling one until January. 
 But Mr. Ghosn said that consumer tastes and looming federal guidelines gave the company ample reasons to develop more environmentally friendly vehicles.
 ''The global automotive industry has a responsibility to be part of the solutions that increase fuel efficiency,'' he said in a speech here at the Council on Foreign Relations. He noted that the diesel Maxima would have up to 30 percent better fuel economy than the standard gasoline version. ''We will be ready to offer our customers what they want.''
 Modern diesel technology, already widespread in Europe, is slowly making its way to the United States. The new engines are a far cry from the coughing, stinking diesel engines of the past, and have lower greenhouse gas emissions and better fuel economy than gasoline engines.
 DaimlerChrysler offers a new-era diesel engine in the Mercedes E-Class, and has plans to start selling a diesel Grand Cherokee this year. 
 General Motors, Honda, Audi, Volkswagen and BMW have plans sell diesel engines that meet federal guidelines in the future. 
 But diesel engines have been less popular in Japan. Mr. Ghosn said on Wednesday that Nissan plans to sell the new diesel vehicles in Japan and China by 2010.
 Nissan has not said what percentage of its Maxima fleet in the United States or abroad would have diesel engines.
 Daniel F. Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global warming program, said the new engine would allow Nissan to make up for some of its past environmental missteps.
 ''There are a number of categories in which Nissan is sort of a laggard among the Japanese leaders,'' he said. ''It's good news that Nissan is trying to find ways to improve its environmental performance. If they follow the lead of Honda and Toyota, it can bring much cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles to market and make more money doing it.''
 With its sales and overall performance in a slump, Nissan is taking a hard look at what does, and does not, sell. ''Consumers want environmentally friendly cars,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''They want to have the pleasure of driving without the guilt.'' 
 Later, in answer to questions from reporters, Mr. Ghosn made it clear that the company would not buy Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler, which is looking at spinning off the money-losing division. ''Some people are a little worried about Nissan,'' he said. ''So you don't want to engage in anything like this.'' 
 He declined to address why the merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz did not seem to be working. Mr. Ghosn has faced questions himself about whether the alliance of Nissan and the French carmaker Renault is a failure.
 ''If you want to know the reality, you have to be inside,'' he said, adding that even from the inside, it is not always easy to tell why the business is stumbling. ''The execution of alliances is something that's extremely delicate.''
 Mr. Ghosn also offered his thoughts on the troubles in the American auto industry, which he said are probably cyclical. 
 ''We are used to hitting bumps and reflecting on them,'' he said. ''Hitting bumps is normal in our industry.'' He added: ''The mistake is to say, 'Don't worry. There's no problem.' ''

HEADLINE: Software By Microsoft Is Nearly Free For the Needy

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In an effort to expand its global reach in computing, Microsoft plans to offer a stripped-down version of Windows, Office and other software for $3 to people in developing nations.
 The program, which is being announced in Beijing today by the Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, represents an ambitious expansion of efforts to introduce products to those who have lacked access to personal computers, especially in developing nations.
While these countries have a growing appetite for technology as a means to spur growth and raise living standards, they also have very limited budgets. Some governments have encouraged alternatives to Microsoft's Windows, notably Linux, a free operating system. 
 The Microsoft push comes as a nonprofit project, One Laptop per Child, plans this year to start producing machines priced at about $150 -- with a goal of reaching $100 -- that will run a version of Linux. Several countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Nigeria, have made tentative commitments to distribute the laptops to millions of schoolchildren.
 Microsoft has offered discounted versions of Windows selectively in the past, to a few developing nations like Malaysia and Thailand, priced at $30 or less. But the new program, called Microsoft Unlimited Potential, goes further with more software and deeper price cuts and extends to all developing nations, said Microsoft's senior vice president for emerging markets, Orlando Ayala.
 Mr. Ayala said that the program also would be offered to low-income communities in the developed nations, including the United States -- those families with incomes in the bottom 15 percent of the population, about $15,000 a year for an average household .
 Under the program, Microsoft would make its discounted software available for installation on computers that would typically be sold to national, state or local governments, which would then distribute the PCs to individuals.
 The price of the machines, Microsoft said, would depend on PC makers and what hardware features were included. Industry analysts said basic machines with the $3 Microsoft bundle of programs could be priced at $300 or less. The standard retail price of the software in the $3 bundle, including Windows XP Starter Edition and Office Home and Office 2007, would be about $150. 
 There are about a billion PC users worldwide, mainly in developed nations. The initial goal of the Microsoft program, working with many industry partners, would be to add another billion PC users by 2015, Mr. Ayala said.
 The new Microsoft program is aimed directly at students, through national and local governments that buy Windows PCs for schoolchildren, both for schoolwork and for their personal use at home. For the last five years, Microsoft's outreach to developing countries has focused on schools and training teachers as well as students through a program called Partners in Learning.
 Software piracy is another pressing concern for Microsoft and other software companies in developing nations. Mr. Ayala acknowledged that piracy and the competition from Linux were business issues for Microsoft.
 ''But this isn't really about responding to those things, but about finding an economically practical way to put good software and a good computer into these people's hands and get them going in life,'' Mr. Ayala said.
 ''Certainly,'' he added, ''for Microsoft this is an investment in the long term. These are the consumers of the future.'' 
 No matter what happens with Microsoft's effort in developing countries, it is not going to have much impact on the company's financial performance anytime soon. Its annual sales are running at more than $45 billion a year.
 ''Microsoft is betting that at least some of the kids from developing nations will turn into buyers of more mainstream products later in life,'' said Roger L. Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, a research firm. ''The theory is that if you get them young, you can keep them for life.''
 Microsoft has additional steps planned beyond the discounted software. For example, the company said that it would add 200 Microsoft Innovation Centers in 25 countries in the next two years. These centers -- Microsoft already has 110 in 60 nations -- train local people in software development and provide assistance in starting businesses.
 Economic development experts have long debated whether scarce resources in poorer nations should be spent on computers, when there may be more pressing needs like training teachers, building schools and buying books. Programs like Microsoft's and One Laptop per Child are not giveaways.
 ''I haven't seen any evidence that the digital divide is more acute or more consequential than say the nutritional divide, the elementary education divide or the basic health care divide,'' said Aaditya Mattoo, an economist at the World Bank. 
 Still, as the price of technology continues to fall and its impact spreads, there is a recognition that access to computers and technology skills can be an important ingredient in development.
 Today Microsoft is announcing an alliance with the Asian Development Bank to support local technology entrepreneurs, use technology in teaching and learning and promote local research programs. 
 ''Information communications technology holds significant promise for poverty reduction,'' said Larry Greenwood, a vice president at the bank.

HEADLINE: Chinese Growth Shows Little Restraint, Rising 11.1% in Quarter

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 19 

 BODY:
China's economy continues to accelerate at a blistering pace, growing 11.1 percent in the first quarter of this year from the first quarter of 2006, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released Thursday.
 The surge in growth is almost certain to force Beijing to step up efforts to cool the economy. Pressure is also mounting on officials to allow the value of the currency, the yuan, to appreciate more quickly.
A benchmark Chinese share index -- anticipating higher interest rates and perhaps other measures aimed at restraining domestic stocks -- dropped 4.5 percent Thursday, ending a robust rally that had driven prices to record highs in recent days. 
 Despite the losses, the Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index closed at 3,449.02, up more than 200 percent in the last 16 months.
 Roughly a dozen interest rate increases and other moves to tighten money and lending over the last three years have failed to tame growth in China, the world's fastest-growing major economy.
 Fueled by soaring exports and huge investments in infrastructure, factories and energy supplies, China could soon overtake Germany to become the world's third-largest economy, behind those of the United States and Japan. 
 While most economists called the quarterly growth figures surprisingly strong, they said the data was distorted somewhat by a huge injection of government money into the economy, which encouraged lending, as well as by exporters' seeking to avoid foreign tariffs that may be imposed later in the year.
 ''This is the first-quarter blowout,'' says Jonathan Anderson, chief Asia economist at UBS. ''But we don't expect this to continue. There were a lot of wacky things happening in the first quarter.''
 The burst of growth, one of the largest in a decade, came on the heels of four consecutive years of double-digit economic growth, including an increase last year of 10.7 percent, the fastest annual growth in a decade.
 The statistics bureau said that retail sales rose 15 percent, industrial production was up 18 percent and exports jumped 28 percent. 
 The report also noted a 2.7 percent rise in consumer prices, partly because of rising food costs. But core inflation remained low, the government said.
 One challenge is to keep the economy humming ahead of 2008, when Beijing will play host to the Summer Olympics.
 Economists say China's economy remains largely healthy, though they expect another interest rate increase soon in an effort to reduce excessive lending.
 Mr. Anderson at UBS said officials could intervene in the equity markets to end the steep rally there that could prove to be a threat to the economy.
 Shen Minggao, an economist at Citigroup, said in a report issued late Thursday that officials may also step up efforts to allow the currency to appreciate more quickly, hoping to dry up excess liquidity.
 While some economists say that China could take stronger measures to cool things off, they expect tightening to be gradual. 
 Chinese officials have long asserted that the pace of currency revaluation must be measured and that they will not be pressed into moving hastily.
 Last week, the United States filed two complaints with the World Trade Organization, maintaining that China was engaged in widespread abuse of copyrights and trademarks. 
 With Washington stepping up efforts to win trade concessions, some economists expect China to concede some ground. Hong Liang of Goldman Sachs has forecast that the Chinese currency will appreciate about 9 percent in value in the next year. She also expects further policy tightening to curb lending.

HEADLINE: Navigating the Cinema Sprawl

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
Last year the Tribeca Film Festival had its big expansion, surging to 174 feature films shown at theaters far beyond TriBeCa. This year despite a slight contraction to 157 features -- about what it was two years ago -- the festival remains a daunting sprawl, reaching from Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan to the Upper East Side and up to the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights. 
Here are some suggestions for how to economize and get the most out of the festival, which opens Wednesday and runs through May 6. Full schedule and tickets: tribecafilmfestival.org. CONSIDER A PASS -- This year prices for most screenings have jumped 50 percent, to $18. Organizers say the additional revenue is needed to cover expenses -- outfitting dozens of theaters with digital projectors, for example -- and to defray a budget deficit. To soften the blow the festival offers various combo passes. At $1,100 the all-access Hudson Pass makes sense only for the most voracious film tourist. A $150 Daytimer Pass, for entry before 6 p.m. on weekdays and 4 p.m. on weekends, is a bargain for anyone planning to attend 10 or more screenings. Family packages are also available. FACTOR IN GEOGRAPHY -- All ticketholders must arrive 30 minutes before showtime or lose their seats, which is great news for anyone in a standby line. But with theaters across Manhattan it's best to plan a day's film outings -- ticketed or not -- for as few neighborhoods as possible. CONSIDER A MARATHON -- This year the festival is adding a new subseries, the Tribeca/ESPN Sports Film Festival, with 14 pictures. They are spread all over the schedule, but aficionados have a chance to see all the films on May 5 at the AMC Kips Bay Theater, on Second Avenue at 32nd Street. The 10 films in the family festival will be shown at the same theater tomorrow and Sunday. HIT THE DRIVE-IN (ON FOOT) -- Hustling around town and waiting on standby lines can be exhausting. A relaxing alternative is three so-called Drive-In screenings, outdoors on the World Financial Center Plaza beginning at dusk. The films this year are the 20th-anniversary rerelease of ''Dirty Dancing'' (Thursday), the new animated family comedy ''Surf's Up'' (next Friday) and the documentary ''Planet B-Boy'' (April 28). Most relaxing is the price: free. BEN SISARIO

HEADLINE: Times Co., Gannett and Tribune Co. Report Declines

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Buffeted by an ongoing advertising recession, The New York Times Company and the Gannett Company announced yesterday that their first-quarter profits declined while the Tribune Company reported a loss.
 The disappointing results underscored the increasingly tough economic times faced by the industry as advertisers continued to shift their focus away from print to the Internet. In particular, areas like real estate and classified, previously rich revenue generators for newspapers, continued to be weak.
The New York Times Company reported a 26 percent decline in its first-quarter profit. Earnings were $23.9 million, compared with $32.4 million last year. Stripping out special items like staff reduction costs, an accelerated depreciation charge and a tax adjustment, the company's earnings of 25 cents a share were the same as a year ago. 
 Within the Times Company's news media group, which includes The New York Times and The Boston Globe, overall advertising revenue decreased by 4.3 percent. Advertising revenue at The New York Times Media Group declined 3.5 percent, and it was down 4.2 percent at The New England Media Group. 
 While newspaper companies have been eager to highlight how fast their Internet advertising is growing, the Times Company decided to reduce its 2007 guidance for Internet revenue growth, suggesting that the transition from a print advertising model may be a long time coming.
 ''Clearly this is not going to be a bang-up year for the newspaper business,'' said John Morton, an independent newspaper analyst. ''There is stiff competition for Internet advertising, and the transition will take longer and may well be less profitable than was anticipated.''
 In a statement, Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive of the Times Company, described the advertising environment as ''difficult.'' She also mentioned the recent 31 percent increase in the company's dividend and said that the company's dividend yield of 4 percent was above its peers. 
 The Times Company, which has its annual meeting next week, is facing investor criticism over its stock performance and its broader investment strategies.
 She said that Internet revenue rose 22 percent and was now 10 percent of the company's total revenue. The company had originally forecast 2007 Internet revenue growth to be 30 percent.
 Asked on a conference call what the company planned to do with the $575 million it had raised via the pending sale of its television stations, Ms. Robinson said that debt reduction was one possibility -- the Times Company currently has $1.4 billion in debt -- and that others included investments and acquisitions. She also said that ''we are looking at a repurchase of stock.''
 The Tribune Company, which publishes The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times, reported a loss of $15.6 million after paying a series of nonoperating charges related to severance payments and making an adjustment in the value of a company investment. 
 Real estate advertising was down 15 percent and classified advertising was of 14 percent, underscoring the difficult advertising environment faced by publishers.
 ''The print advertising environment was challenging in the first quarter due to softness in classified categories,'' said Dennis J. FitzSimons, the chief of the Tribune Company, which last month agreed to a deal with the real estate investor Samuel Zell to be taken private.
 Gannett, which publishes USA Today, reported a 10.5 percent decline in its first-quarter profit, as income fell from $235.3 million to $210.6 million. Earnings declined to 90 cents a share, from 99 cents. 
 Advertising revenue was 8 percent lower compared with the previous year, a downturn the company attributed to an advertising spike in 2005 related to the Olympic Games as well as the weak domestic real estate market.

HEADLINE: Banker Personally Backed Friend for Iraq Contract in '03

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz, while serving as deputy secretary of defense, personally recommended that his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, be awarded a contract for travel to Iraq in 2003 to advise on setting up a new government, says a previously undisclosed inquiry by the Pentagon's inspector general.
 The inquiry, as described by a senior Pentagon official, concluded that there was no wrongdoing in Mr. Wolfowitz's role in the hiring of Ms. Riza by the Science Applications International Corporation, a Pentagon contractor, because Ms. Riza had the expertise required to advise on the role of women in Islamic countries. 
The investigators also found that Mr. Wolfowitz, now president of the World Bank, had not exerted improper influence in Ms. Riza's hiring. Earlier this week, Science Applications International said an unnamed Defense Department official had directed that she be hired. She had been a World Bank employee for five years at the time.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's office said it could not comment on the latest disclosure. Ms. Riza's lawyer, Victoria Toensing, did not respond to a request for a comment.
 The disclosure of Mr. Wolfowitz's role in Ms. Riza's contract in 2003 provides a new indication of his involvement in her employment, at a time when the World Bank's board is investigating his role in arranging for a large salary increase, a promotion and a transfer for Ms. Riza when he came to the bank in 2005.
 The disclosure also came on a day of swirling pressure at the bank, where the 24-member executive board met into the evening to discuss the situation amid mounting calls for Mr. Wolfowitz's resignation.
 Bank officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were divulging proceedings that were not supposed to be made public, reported that the rift between employees and the president had become a major distraction from their work, with some employees wearing blue ribbons in a display of defiance against his leadership. 
 ''People feel paralyzed,'' one official said. ''No one is doing any work at all. This genie can never go back to the bottle.''
 As the board met, officials said a separate review was being conducted by the vice presidents, who oversee specific countries, regions and subject matters, and who were polling their staffs. The overwhelming sentiment, officials said, was that Mr. Wolfowitz should step down.
 In another sign of crumbling support, bank officials and others said that a consensus had emerged among European officials involved with the bank that Mr. Wolfowitz had lost his ability to lead the institution, not so much because of the issue of Ms. Riza but because of other policy disputes over the last two years.
 The meeting of the board was called by the panel's most senior member, Eckhardt Deutscher, of Germany. There was no sign of what the board would do, but Mr. Deutscher gave a speech on Thursday to a German foundation offering a strong though oblique criticism of Mr. Wolfowitz.
 ''The World Bank needs a strong leadership with compassion, integrity and vision,'' Mr. Deutscher said in the speech, to the Friedrich Naumann Foundation. ''The governance structures need a fundamental reform. And lastly, the World Bank needs credibility, credibility, credibility.''
 Bank officials said Mr. Deutscher, who has worked closely with Mr. Wolfowitz on developing the bank's anticorruption policies, now favors having him step down, a consensus already reached by Britain, France, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries.
 A senior European official involved in the bank said Mr. Deutscher was ''leading the charge'' for a change in leadership and trying to assert the board's role, effectively wresting control from Mr. Wolfowitz.
 ''For the moment, the view among the Europeans is, 'Let's continue the discussions, and it is up to the dean to express what the concern is,' '' this official said, speaking about Mr. Deutscher. ''It is in everybody's interest to avoid bringing this to a head.'' 
 On the matter of the contract for Ms. Riza in 2003, the Pentagon inspector general's office opened a review in March 2005, two years after the invasion of Iraq and one year after it began a sweeping investigation into contracting practices during the early chaotic months of the war.
 The Pentagon official who disclosed details of the inquiry agreed to answer questions on the condition of anonymity because it involved the role of senior officials in recommending individuals. 
 The official said the relatively small contract came under scrutiny only when a Pentagon investigator noticed Ms. Riza's name and recalled that she was romantically linked to Mr. Wolfowitz. 
 The investigator deemed the matter was worth opening an inquiry, because the type of contract called specifically for it to be assigned to Ms. Riza. But a more formal investigation was not instigated, he said, because ''it was determined that Ms. Riza was uniquely qualified to fill the contract requirements.''
 Investigators also determined that ''the recommendation of individuals does not constitute any misuse of office,'' the official said in describing the findings of the inspector general. ''Nobody violated or misused their office.'' Nevertheless, the inquiry found that Ms. Riza ''was recommended by Wolfowitz as well as others, in verbal form,'' the official said.
 It was not clear how Mr. Wolfowitz's verbal recommendation was relayed through the Pentagon hierarchy and nascent occupation authority and then to the contractor, which is known as SAIC.
 Earlier this week, a spokeswoman for SAIC said the company was told to contract with Ms. Riza by an official in the office of the under secretary of defense for policy, then headed by Douglas J. Feith. 
 But on Thursday, Pentagon officials, clarifying the source of the contract, said it was managed through the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, then headed by Jay Garner, a retired Army three-star general. General Garner said in an interview that he did not remember Ms. Riza's playing any role in advising the American-led occupation. 
 The World Bank board is also examining the contract to see if it complied with bank rules requiring employees to get permission for outside consulting work when it might conflict with their duties at the bank. At the time of the contract, it was against bank policy to have dealings with Iraq, on the ground that it was a country under foreign military occupation.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Climbed Slightly in March

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The economy is continuing to lose steam and may expand only slightly in coming months, the Conference Board's gauge of future growth indicated yesterday.
 But economists said that a resilient labor market indicated that the economy remained generally healthy. 
The Conference Board, a business research organization, said its index of leading economic indicators climbed a tepid 0.1 percent, to 137.4, in March, as expected. The index forecasts economic activity over the next three to six months.
 The latest reading reverses two consecutive months of declines, but it still leaves the index below its most recent high of 138.6 in January 2006 and the year-ago level of 138.5 in March 2006.
 The reading tracks 10 economic indicators. Six of those readings were positive in March: initial unemployment claims, weekly manufacturing hours, real money supply, vendor performance, building permits and manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials.
 The negative contributors were stock prices, consumer expectations, interest rate spread and manufacturers' new orders for nondefense capital goods.
 In other economic data, the Labor Department said weekly applications for unemployment benefits slipped by 4,000, to 339,000, after hitting a two-month high a week earlier.
 The decline in jobless claims was significantly smaller than the expected drop of around 20,000. But economists said the data signaled that the labor market remained generally sound even as economic growth slowed over the last year.
 Ken Goldstein, labor economist for the Conference Board, said that the drop of 0.3 percent in the index of leading indicators over the last six months was not enough to indicate the economy was in danger.
 ''The winds are not all blowing in one direction. Who knows? Maybe after Labor Day, we might be talking about an economy picking up steam,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Feast of Serious Cinema; Partygoers Welcome

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
A three-ring circus and a temple of high art; a community development project and a political forum; a multipurpose theme park with oases for sports fans and children and a star-packed movie premiere -- this is the sixth annual Tribeca Film Festival, which begins on Wednesday and continues for 12 days around the city. 
 So much is happening that Tribeca's substance as a serious, sweeping survey of world cinema might be obscured by the glamour and fun. More than any other American film festival it operates from the premise that the movies wouldn't be the movies without some Barnum & Bailey razzle-dazzle and Hollywood tinsel. Think of it as the annual spring film festival that eats New York.
If the sprawl is intimidating, Tribeca isn't running wild. There are fewer films this year than last, and a New York category has been eliminated. Still, the statistics are daunting: 157 feature films and 88 shorts from 47 countries and territories. In the competition 18 films will vie for best narrative feature and 16 for best documentary feature. 
 There are grand openings: the United States premiere of ''Spider-Man 3'' on April 30; the world premiere of Curtis Hanson's romantic drama ''Lucky You'' on May 1; and on the closing night another world premiere: ''The Gates,'' Antonio Ferrera and Albert Maysles's HBO documentary about Christo and Jean-Claude's 2005 Central Park installation. 
 It all begins with a gala -- Al Gore is the host -- that introduces the SOS Short Films Program. Consisting of seven movies about global warming, each directed by a different filmmaker, the program includes contributions by Jonathan Glazer (''Sexy Beast''), Kevin Macdonald (''The Last King of Scotland''), Abel Ferrara (''King of New York''), Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (''Jesus Camp''), Aardman Animation (''Wallace and Gromit''), Amy Berg (''Deliver Us From Evil'') and Ari Sandel (''West Bank Story''). Like last year's opening salvo, the premiere of ''United 93,'' this year's pointedly addresses controversy and current events. The festival was born out of the ashes of 9/11 to help revitalize the devastated economy of Lower Manhattan, and its focus on issues makes it an exception among film festivals. This year there are a plethora of films dealing with the Middle East and the war in Iraq. 
 Business may have returned to the area, Jane Rosenthal, a co-producer of the festival with Robert De Niro and Craig Hatkoff, said the other day. ''But we're still living with a pit.'' 
 The festival's concept of community development involves more than attracting business to Lower Manhattan. It wants to lure the broad moviegoing audience beyond multiplex fare. The bells and whistles ballyhoo -- including a family movie series, a sports film series and a drive-in movie -- is bait. 
 Having seen some 30 of the films to be shown, many in the competitive categories, I can attest that the festival's artistic level is well above average, although some categories are spottier than others. The films in the Spotlight section (movies with stars, established directors and serious subject matter) and the Showcase section (movies that have earned praise at other festivals) are generally more consistent than the fare in the Discover section (movies by first- and second-time directors).
 As a showcase Tribeca may never match the Cannes Film Festival, which Peter Scarlet, Tribeca's executive director and chief programmer, described as ''a 200-pound gorilla.'' But the absence of the international A-list directors who regularly take their work to Cannes allows more room for lesser-known international talents. In its commitment to world cinema, it's way ahead of the Sundance Film Festival. Eastern Europe and Asia have been particularly fruitful sources of challenging Tribeca Festival films. In any case much of the best of Cannes, which takes place next month, can be seen this fall at the New York Film Festival. 
 Given its roots it is fitting that Tribeca is particularly strong on documentaries, a proliferating genre you might call reality television with a conscience. Last year it distinguished itself with ''The War Tapes,'' ''Jesus Camp'' and ''Jonestown: The Life and Death of the People's Temple.'' This year two films likely to generate serious debate, ''I Am an American Soldier: One Year in Iraq With the 101st Airborne'' and ''Taxi to the Dark Side,'' offer quietly devastating examinations of, respectively, the training of soldiers and the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.
 ''American Soldier,'' directed by John Laurence, follows an elite division for 14 months, from the United States to Samara and Sadr City and then home. By turns moving and appalling, it offers a picture of the best American soldiers as a tightly bonded band of brothers. At the same time it observes how these soldiers are trained to objectify the enemy, or anyone who might be confused with the enemy, as less than human. It's a movie about patriotic servicemen and servicewomen given official license to kill innocent civilians by their superiors; what makes it all the sadder is that the soldiers are such likable people. 
 ''Taxi to the Dark Side,'' Alex Gibney's follow-up to ''Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,'' is a meticulous examination of American policy on the interrogation of prisoners. It traces the scandals at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere to official changes of policy originating in the vice president's office and approved by the secretary of defense. We see documents listing approved methods of interrogation, including waterboarding, which simulates drowning. The film also examines the C.I.A.'s history of research into interrogation techniques, including sense deprivation, as ways to ''break'' a subject. 
 Beth Murphy's ''Beyond Belief'' follows two women whose husbands died in 9/11 on a journey to Kabul to help Afghan widows, whose lives are so miserable that the visitors feel grateful for what they have, despite their loss.
 If many of the films vying for best narrative feature are equally serious, their fingers are not pressed on hot buttons. High on the list of contenders is ''Lady Chatterley,'' the French filmmaker Pascale Ferran's screen realization of the D. H. Lawrence novel about the sensual awakening of a repressed, aristocratic woman with a disabled husband. The 168-minute film, which won five Cesars (the French Oscars) including best film and best actress, is a rapturous visual tone poem in which the images of the forest where Constance Chatterley (Marina Hands) romps with Oliver Parkin (Jean-Louis Couloc'h), the rough-hewn gamekeeper on her estate, and the couple's lovemaking converge in a pantheistic delirium. 
 Patrice Leconte's ''My Best Friend,'' not in the competition, is a smart, acidic French comedy about the meaning of friendship in which a successful art dealer, realizing he has no close friends, hires a garrulous taxi driver to teach him sociability. He is a slow learner. 
 The Turkish film ''Times and Winds'' (''Bas Vakit'') examines the harsh life in a remote mountain village through the eyes of three children. As in ''Lady Chatterley,'' nature is an overwhelming presence in the film, which belongs to the same school of primal humanism as the movies of Satyajit Ray and Abbas Kiarostami, although its edges are harder. Bitter father-son strife, passed down through generations, is a cruel subtext. The music of the Estonian composer Arvo Part wafts through the film likea dry mountain breeze.
 ''Times and Winds'' is typical of the majority of serious films in its toughness and absence of sentimentality. In Antonio Negret's ''Towards Darkness,'' a grim story of kidnapping set in Colombia, America Ferrera does a 180-degree turn from her endearing alter ego in ''Ugly Betty.'' In Shane Meadows's ''This Is England,'' set in 1983, an 11-year-old boy who has lost his father is adopted by a gang of racist skinheads; the movie feels more authentic than many documentaries. 
 In the Hungarian director Gyorgy Palfi's surreal ''Taxidermia,'' grossly obese men indulge in speed eating contests, then vomit what they've ingested; in the film's nauseated vision, the human body is a monstrosity to be stuffed and mounted. Leading off the five short stories in ''The Optimists,'' by the Serbian director Goran Paskaljevic, is a tale of a town devastated by a natural disaster whose residents clamor to be hypnotized into happiness by a lunatic. In the final story a busload of terminally ill patients who invested their faith and money in a con man go on a rollicking journey to a healing hot spring that lands them in a muddy pit. 
 The festival's most intriguing special event is Paolo Cherchi Usai's 74-minute silent film, ''Passio.'' Synchronized with Arvo Part's majestic 1982 oratorio, which will be performed live by the Trinity Choir, the film will have three screenings at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, on April 27 and 28, and a fourth at Trinity Church on April 29. 
 ''The hardest-hitting, cruelest, most affecting collection of sound and image this side of Bunuel'' is how Linda Williams, a film scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, described this assemblage of found images of human suffering and scientific experimentation in the journal Film Quarterly. Images, which Mr. Usai calls ''countless manifestations of our neglected or repressed collective memory,'' are coordinated with Mr. Part's stark, minimalist score so that the music seems to conjure the pictures rather than simply illustrating them. 
 From an entirely different musical wellspring is ''Rebirth of a Nation,'' DJ Spooky's eerie, unsettling video ''remix'' of D. W. Griffith's ''Birth of a Nation,'' with a hip-hop soundtrack that underscores the movie's crude racist stereotypes. Its creator, also known as Paul D. Miller, has described his work as making a film he finds offensive ''fall in on itself.'' It will be shown at the Winter Garden on May 4 and 5.
 But all is not doom and gloom. The festival includes an unusual number of music documentaries, from an upbeat tribute to the jazz singer Anita O'Day to the even more upbeat ''Autism: The Musical,'' in which five autistic children from Los Angeles write and rehearse a musical comedy; ''Chops,'' about a high school jazz-band competition; ''Planet B-Boy,'' about the global resurgence of break dancing; and ''Pete Seeger: The Power of Song,'' which looks at the life and contribution of the great folk singer. 
 Despite all the grief, suffering, strife and despair on view, there is still a song to sing.

HEADLINE: Owners Lose As Bosses Win In Bad Mergers

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
If it's not your money, you may be quite willing to spend more of it.
 That insight may seem obvious, but academic research demonstrating that it is true set off the great boom in equity compensation for corporate management over the last three decades.
As an article in The Journal of Finance this month puts it, a wealth of studies supports the hypothesis that ''managers with greater ownership, or managers with more equity-based incentives, are less likely to take value-destroying actions.'' Yet over time, few management actions have done as good a job of destroying value as have mergers and acquisitions. Some work out fine, but many do not. 
 Now academic research offers insights into how the very equity-based incentives -- stock options and restricted stocks -- that were supposed to make managers think like owners have instead encouraged them to overpay for acquisitions. The bosses win, whether or not the owners lose.
 A new study by economists at the University of Pittsburgh and Ohio State University looked at all-cash takeovers done from 1990 to 2005, and found that the premiums paid varied based on who was doing the buying.
 On average, public companies made bids that drove up the target share price by 32 percent. But bids from privately held companies were lower, pushing prices up 22 percent. The figure for private equity funds was 20 percent.
 That difference means the public companies are paying more -- and thus the merged companies are less likely to do well, all other things being equal.
 One of the authors, Rene M. Stulz, a finance professor at Ohio State, told me that he first thought the explanation would be in the type of companies being bought, but that did not prove to be the case.
 Nor did it turn out that the ownership position of the bosses of the target company made a difference. Those with big stakes were not more likely to negotiate good deals than those with smaller positions.
 Instead, the data showed that the public company differential vanished if managers of the bidder owned at least 20 percent of the equity. Then they acted like private companies, and paid about the same premium.
 If a bidding war develops, or negative information surfaces, private buyers are also more likely to walk away from deals than are public companies, concluded the study done by Leonce L. Bargeron, Frederik P. Schlingemann and Chad J. Zutter of the University of Pittsburgh, along with Mr. Stulz.
 So why are public companies willing to pay more? An answer may come from the Journal of Finance article, written by Jarrad Harford of the University of Washington and Kai Li of the University of British Columbia.
 They found that corporate managers are often richer after a bad merger than they were before.
 ''While shareholders might assume that their C.E.O.s' large portfolios of stock and options provide the necessary incentives to discourage them from making bad acquisitions,'' they wrote, ''the value of the flow of new grants after an acquisition can swamp'' any incentive offered by the pre-takeover holdings.
 Among mergers that left shareholders worse off than before, the managers emerged wealthier for the experience in three-quarters of the deals.
 One important lesson is that the managers' expectation of the continuing flow of equity grants can provide incentives that sharply differ from the incentives that exist because of the prior grants. A lower stock price can mean better-priced options.
 Pay consultants advising boards on pay for chief executives typically start by calculating the compensation at comparable companies. A big merger can catapult a company into a bigger size category, making the old executive-compensation package appear to be very low compared with the new set of comparable companies. So the bosses get big raises long before it is clear whether the merger is going to work out well.
 Mr. Stulz says the clear advantages to management of mergers -- even if they do not help the shareholders -- mean that the board should be involved in merger discussions from the beginning.
 ''You also want to make sure that you do not compensate management just because the company is bigger,'' he said.
 More likely, some clever consultant will discover this paper and conclude that the answer is clear: Give management 20 percent of the company to assure they will be adequately motivated to keep the interests of shareholders in mind.

HEADLINE: Shares Mostly Fall on a Day of Mixed News

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street averages closed mostly lower yesterday, as investors juggled upbeat economic data, divergent earnings reports and a pullback in Chinese stocks.
 Shares fell at the opening, then began to pare losses after the Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators reversed two months of declines and increased slightly in March, signaling modest growth in coming months.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.79 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,808.63, the second day it reached a closing high. 
 Broader market indicators were down. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.77 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,470.73, down from its highest point in a six and a half years on Wednesday. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.15 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,505.35. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization companies fell 5.06 points, or 0.62 percent, to 819.32.
 Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered those advancing by nearly 2 to 1. Volume was 1.64 billion shares compared with 1.61 billion Wednesday.
 Trading overseas was volatile and lower. The benchmark Shanghai share index tumbled 4.52 percent yesterday, a decline not as steep as the nearly 9 percent drop late in February that touched off wide selling elsewhere. 
 In Tokyo yesterday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues dropped 1.67 percent and in Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index lost 2.30 percent. Stocks declined modestly in Europe. 
 In the United States, earnings have so far buoyed the shares of most major companies reporting; even those with drops in first-quarter profit have been exceeding the forecasts of analysts, who lowered their expectations after the market fell in February.
 Shares of the online auctioneer eBay fell $1.26, to $33.19, after the company said its first-quarter earnings surged 52 percent, partly from lower taxes and a decrease in the number of its shares.
 Nokia, the largest mobile phone maker, said its net profit declined by 6.6 percent as handset prices fell. Nokia advanced 78 cents, to $24.65.
 Merrill Lynch said its first-quarter profit soared from a year earlier, when it booked a charge related to compensation expenses. Yesterday, it declined 55 cents, to $90.11.
 The drug maker Merck, a Dow component, said its first-quarter profit jumped 12 percent on higher sales; its shares rose 46 cents, to $50.15.
 Another drug maker, Schering-Plough, surpassed Wall Street forecasts when its first-quarter profit rose 55 percent. Its shares soared by $2.45, or 8.6 percent, to $31.
 Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris, said profit fell 21 percent amid weakness in domestic cigarette sales. The company raised its full-year earnings forecast, but its shares still fell 68 cents, to $69.40.
 Intel was the biggest gainer among the Dow industrials, up 46 cents, to $21.81, after analysts' upgrades.
 The UnitedHealth Group fell $2.16, to $52.05, after the company reported lackluster enrollment in Medicare-related programs.
 Crude oil for May delivery declined by $1.30 a barrel, to $61.83, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 On the bond market, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32, to 99 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.66 percent from 4.65 percent. Strong Debut for MetroPCS By Reuters 
 Shares of a wireless service provider, MetroPCS Communications, rose 20 percent in their market debut yesterday as investors sought stakes in a fast-growing niche in the telecommunications market.
 The offering price of $23 was above the forecast range of $19 to $21.
 The stock rose as high as $27.61 after opening up 9 percent, at $25.10, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares closed yesterday at $27.40.
 An analyst with SurTerre Research, Todd Rethemeier, said that the $1.15 billion initial public offering generated interest because MetroPCS was a good growth story.

HEADLINE: Ex-Chief At Qwest Found Guilty

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

DATELINE: DENVER, April 19 

 BODY:
Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive who transformed Qwest Communications International into a major telecommunications rival, was convicted Thursday of insider trading.
 A jury in Federal District Court deliberated six days before finding Mr. Nacchio guilty on 19 of 42 counts of insider trading. He was found not guilty of 23 counts of insider trading. The eight men and four women on the jury listened as witnesses testified during the 15-day trial that Mr. Nacchio had exaggerated financial forecasts while concealing Qwest's growing troubles.
 Mr. Nacchio, 57, who was released on $2 million bond, offered a slight smile as he left the courtroom. He declined to comment as he locked arms with his wife and son and walked away. He faces up to 10 years in prison and up to $1 million per count, as well as forfeiture of assets. 
 The judge, Edward W. Nottingham, set sentencing for July 27.
 Earlier, before a packed courtroom, Judge Nottingham methodically read each count. ''Not guilty,'' he said on Count 1, then repeated the phrase 22 times. Mr. Nacchio's son Michael began sobbing, piercing an otherwise hushed courtroom. The defendant and his lawyers stared straight ahead; prosecutors sat stoic. 
 On Count 24, the words and mood changed. ''Guilty,'' the judge said, saying it again 18 times. The younger Mr. Nacchio turned somber. A defense lawyer glanced back at the Nacchio family and shook his head. 
 Prosecutors said that counts 24 through 42 -- the ones Mr. Nacchio was convicted of -- were the most important because they represented $52 million worth of stock sales he made after a trading window opened in 2001. 
 After the trial, Mr. Nacchio's lawyer, Herbert J. Stern, said that he would appeal.
 The prosecution team stood outside the courthouse amid a thicket of reporters and cameras. 
 ''Convicted felon Joe Nacchio has a very nice ring to it,'' the United States attorney for Colorado, Troy A. Eid, said. ''I couldn't be happier that after five and half years, justice has finally been served.''
 An assistant United States attorney, Cliff Stricklin, who led the prosecution, said the jury's verdict proved that ''insider trading is not a victimless crime.'' 
 A fellow federal prosecutor, Colleen Conry, said the verdict would ring out from Denver to Wall Street.
 At a later hearing now that the trial has ended, the judge will rule on a prosecution request that Mr. Nacchio forfeit his assets.
 A former financial adviser to Mr. Nacchio testified at the trial that the executive's net worth was $536 million at the time of the stock sales in 2001 -- testimony that defense lawyers had tried to have stricken as irrelevant and prejudicial.
 The charges against Mr. Nacchio related to his sale of more than $100 million worth of Qwest stock in 2001. The case emerged from a federal investigation into accounting practices at Qwest, based in Denver, a telephone service provider in 14 states, mostly in the West.
 During the trial, which began in March, federal prosecutors sought to portray Mr. Nacchio as a man motivated by greed who knowingly deceived analysts by concealing the company's mounting money problems, while simultaneously unloading his own stock options. 
 Mr. Nacchio's defense team was led by Mr. Stern, a prominent lawyer who, as a young Manhattan prosecutor, helped investigate the murder of Malcolm X and who was praised for cracking down on political corruption as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey in the 1970s. 
 Mr. Stern contended that Mr. Nacchio was a passionately optimistic executive who may have misjudged Qwest's financial future but who believed deeply in his upbeat prognostications. Moreover, Mr. Stern asserted that Mr. Nacchio had needed to sell stock because the options were scheduled to expire.
 But Mr. Nacchio, prosecutors said, set aggressive financial targets that were wildly out of step with the warnings he received from fellow executives about Qwest's failure to increase its recurring revenue. 
 Several former Qwest executives, including Lee Wolfe, a former director of investor relations, testified about a surge of concern over how the company was going to meet its projections and over Qwest's lopsided reliance on one-time transactions. 
 Nonetheless, prosecutors said, Mr. Nacchio continually affirmed a bright financial forecast to analysts, even as the chorus of admonitions from other Qwest executives grew. Finally, in 2001, when he realized Qwest was facing a significant shortfall, prosecutors said, Mr. Nacchio began unloading his stock options, while still publicly proclaiming the company's good fortunes. Mr. Nacchio even backdated the sale of the stock to make it appear unrelated to Qwest's downturn, prosecutors contended. 
 Mr. Stern argued that Mr. Nacchio had derived his projections from a report compiled by a consulting firm hired to assess the merger of Qwest and US West in 1999. There was no way Mr. Nacchio could have foreseen a recession in the market, Mr. Stern said. 
 The defense called three witnesses, one of them Philip F. Anschutz, Qwest's founder. Mr. Anschutz testified that Mr. Nacchio had come to him despondent over the attempted suicide of one of his sons and wanted to resign, an indication of the enormous pressure Mr. Nacchio was under at the time of the stock sales, the defense said. 
 Under Judge Nottingham, who was considered a stickler for punctuality, the trial moved more swiftly than expected. As the proceedings drew to a close, there was speculation as to whether Mr. Nacchio would take the stand to testify about secret government contracts that Qwest was supposedly in line to win. 
 Before the trial, the defense indicated that Mr. Nacchio alone knew about the potentially lucrative contracts, which would have bolstered Qwest's revenues. 
 But the defense never called Mr. Nacchio; putting him on the stand could have proved risky because he would have faced a relentless cross-examination, legal experts said. As a result, the government contracts were barely mentioned. 
 The federal charges capped a sharp turn of fortune for Mr. Nacchio, the son of a New York longshoreman turned bartender, once heralded for his hard-charging leadership as an executive for AT&T. 
 Hired to lead Qwest in 1997, Mr. Nacchio oversaw the company during a period of revenue growth and acquisitions. 
 But by 2001, Qwest's stock value had started to sink, and Qwest's board forced Mr. Nacchio to resign in June 2002. During that period, the federal government was investigating possible accounting fraud at the company. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on Dec. 20, 2005. 

GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Selling While Things Turned Sour'' Joseph P. Nacchio, who became chief executive of Qwest in January 1997, was charged with 42 counts of insider trading and found guilty of 19 of them. On trades related to those counts, he made $52 million. Here is a timeline of events. A month after his ouster, the company restated $1.1 billion of transactions, citing accounting errors.

HEADLINE: 2 Subprime Lenders Announce Job Cuts; Call Centers Closed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
General Electric's subprime lending unit, WMC Mortgage, closed three centers yesterday and cut 771 jobs -- about half of its remaining staff -- while the Residential Capital home-lending unit of GMAC announced it would eliminate as many as 700 workers, or 5 percent of its American work force. 
 The moves were part of a broad retrenchment in the subprime lending industry amid mounting loan losses.
A WMC spokeswoman, Brandie Young, said that WMC Mortgage was tightening lending standards and reducing loan originations in the United States, and would have about 700 employees in two call centers after the cuts. The cuts, first reported by Reuters, are in addition to the reduction of 460 jobs announced in March.
 Centers shut yesterday were in Cosa Mesa and San Ramon, Calif., and in Addison, Tex. Remaining centers are in Orangeburg, N.Y., and at WMC's headquarters in Burbank, Calif.
 At GMAC, about 600 to 700 workers will lose their jobs by midyear, and at least 300 vacant positions will not be filled, a spokeswoman, Gina Proia, said in an interview. Residential Capital, known as ResCap and based in Minneapolis, will have about 12,000 employees after the reductions are made, she said.
 ''The decision was influenced by current market conditions and the deterioration of the U.S. mortgage market,'' Ms. Proia said.
 The cuts follow a $651 million fourth-quarter operating loss at ResCap. In the last month, the lender has also announced the departure of its treasurer, chief financial officer and chief executive.
 General Motors sold a majority stake in GMAC, formerly known as the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, in November to a group led by Cerberus Capital Management.
 The cutbacks were reported earlier by The Minneapolis Star Tribune.

HEADLINE: MAYOR TO UNVEIL 25-YEAR OUTLINE FOR GREENER CITY

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and CHARLES V. BAGLI; William Neuman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With New York's population expected to grow by one million in two decades, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will call on Sunday for a raft of ambitious and sometimes contentious proposals that are intended to ease traffic congestion, reduce air pollution, build housing, improve mass transit and develop abandoned industrial land.
 The speech, which mayoral aides have described as the centerpiece of his final 32 months in office, will outline his vision for the city over the next quarter century, setting priorities for refurbishing the city's aging bridges, water mains, transit system, power plants and building codes. And in the talk on Sunday -- Earth Day -- the mayor will propose doing so in a way that reduces the strain on natural resources like water, clean air and land.
Toward that end, Mr. Bloomberg is expected to advocate more than 100 proposals, including charging drivers to enter the busiest sections of Manhattan, and using zoning and tax incentives to encourage the construction of 250,000 homes. 
 He also is expected to call for offering rebates and other enticements to make new and existing buildings more energy-efficient, and to ask for the creation of a public authority that would supplant the power that state government holds over many city operations, people briefed on the speech said.
 He is also expected to propose spending $400 million to clean up polluted sites for new construction, to support the construction of another rail tunnel under the Hudson River to Midtown at a cost of $7.5 billion, and to create new zoning and tax breaks to increase the supply of housing in the hope of making the overall market more affordable.
 No one has ever accused the Bloomberg administration of not thinking big; trying to win approval to build one of the world's most expensive football stadiums on the West Side of Manhattan was just one example. But getting big results has often proved elusive. And there is little doubt that much of the mayor's package of proposals will face stiff opposition from local politicians as well as from the state legislators who will decide whether to approve many aspects of it.
 Policy experts said the mayor's agenda, known as PlaNYC, is perhaps his most far-reaching and its fate could determine whether his administration will be remembered as truly transformative.
 ''This is their best opportunity to stamp this city with the administration's imprint for decades to come,'' said David S. Birdsell, dean of the Baruch School of Public Affairs. The plan was developed by a team of experts working under Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. 
 Administration officials have worked hard to keep the plan under wraps and have declined to comment on any of its details, cautioning that they are not final. But a picture has emerged from interviews with several government officials, business leaders and advocates who have been briefed on it, none of whom would allow their names to be used because Bloomberg officials had sworn them to secrecy.
 One of the most significant proposals calls for creating an authority that would raise money and identify strategic infrastructure investments. The city currently has little say over the agencies, like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Empire State Development Corporation or the State Department of Transportation, that control large-scale projects. 
 The new authority would be composed of city and state appointees, giving the city greater control, although the governor would have some veto authority.
 What will almost certainly be the most contentious idea, however, involves charging drivers to enter the busiest sections of Manhattan. The proposal being formulated calls for money raised from congestion pricing, which could reach hundreds of millions of dollars a year, to go into a fund for large-scale transportation investments. Those would include projects for the boroughs outside Manhattan, where drivers would be most affected by new fees that could reach $8, minus a credit for any tolls already in effect. 
 The scope of Mr. Bloomberg's plan is fraught with economic and political obstacles that may make the Earth Day address more the beginning of a long and complex negotiation than an immediate spur to action.
 Opposition has already formed to congestion pricing, which Mr. Bloomberg himself has resisted in recent years. Walter McCaffrey, a lobbyist representing Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free, which is made up of garage owners, the Queens Chamber of Commerce and some labor and neighborhood advocates, says the city should look at other methods of dealing with congestion before resorting to such a ''draconian'' method.
 ''This is another tax for New York City folks,'' Mr. McCaffrey said. ''If you're riding in a limo you can afford it. But this city is also made up of working-class people who would be hurt by it.''
 The package of proposals is sure to cost tens of billions of dollars and require state legislation and the cooperation from the very people and institutions that may be threatened by the changes: the City Council, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the governor and the State Legislature. The notion of even proposing a plan for congestion pricing, for instance, is so politically toxic that some Bloomberg officials refer to it as ''the program that shall not be named'' for fear that the mayor himself will in the end decide to withdraw support for the idea.
 City officials seem mindful that their failure to win allies among legislators and civic groups helped in 2005 to scuttle plans to build a football stadium for the Jets on the West Side. That defeat in turn ended the city's Olympic bid, which had brought with it a grand development agenda for the city, some of which then lost momentum.
 This time, back with an agenda that in some ways resembles the Olympic plan in a green dress, officials are trying a different approach, working to engage the public and build good will for their ideas. Officials created an advisory council that included environmentalists, business groups, labor leaders and planning advocates like the Regional Plan Association; many of them opposed the stadium, but now say they are happy with the way the new package of proposals has developed.
 Over the past three months, officials from the city's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability have played host to meetings with environmentalists, energy and planning experts, scientists, academics, business leaders and ordinary citizens to solicit ideas. They created a Web site that got more than 50,000 hits and resulted in 3,000 ideas, including proposals to add more incentives for so-called green roofs and to ban cars in Manhattan.
 Aware of how high-stakes and controversial some of the proposals are, the administration has urged the Partnership for New York City, a business group that has pushed for a congestion pricing plan, and others to raise money for an ad campaign, which they are planning to start the day after Mr. Bloomberg's speech.
 ''We've been summoned to be at City Hall at 10:30 Monday to say nice things about this whole effort,'' said one real estate industry executive who is supportive of the mayor's initiative.
 Bloomberg officials have also been networking behind the scenes, beginning to share the plan with government officials and legislators over the last several days. 
 In some ways, the political moment is ripe for many of the proposals, as the leaders of the city, New York State and New Jersey -- Mr. Bloomberg, Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Gov. Jon S. Corzine (now recovering from a near-fatal traffic accident) -- are all wealthy, strong-willed men who are not so beholden to the traditional political apparatus.
 But as Mr. Bloomberg is only too well aware from the clock on his office wall that counts down the remaining time in his term, he has only 986 days left to pursue his policy ambitions.
 As Mr. Bloomberg put it in a speech on the subject in December, he began feeling that urgency as he saw the scale of the city's needs.
 ''Unless we considered the full range of challenges to our city's physical environment, the progress we'd worked so long and so hard for might be at risk,'' he said. ''And it became clear that to secure a stronger, cleaner, and healthier city for our children and grandchildren, we had to start acting now.''

HEADLINE: Seeking the Nixon Behind the Caricature

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
IN a quiet corner of the bar at the Hotel Plaza Athenee in New York, Frank Langella raised his hands in victory signs, furrowed his brow and shook his jowls violently: the International Symbol for Richard Nixon. 
 Mr. Langella, one of the most celebrated stage actors of his generation, has tackled both Dracula and Sherlock Holmes; he knows what it means to step into a role that is already cemented in myth. But there may be no caricature as permanently etched in the American imagination as the one he's playing now.
''Nixon was a great monster for good and bad, a delicious person to caricature,'' he said. ''The first week of rehearsals all of the actors were doing him, and I finally had to say, 'You have to stop.' '' 
 ''Frost/Nixon,'' which opens on Broadway Sunday night at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, is a play about the series of television interviews David Frost conducted in 1977 with Richard M. Nixon, who had resigned from the presidency three years earlier. Mr. Frost paid Nixon $600,000 for the chance to prove he could play hardball and nearly blew it when Nixon swatted away his questions with anecdotes and generalities.
 Then came the last interview. Nixon's startling admission that he had ''let the American people down'' was not the coup; the coup, a character in the play says, was having Nixon's face -- ''swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat -- filling every television screen in the country.''
 The reductive nature of imagery is one of the main points of the play: Make the dual victory signs for five seconds, and that's who you are for life. Breaking free is hard for the person involved; for an actor with less than two hours to work with, it's nearly impossible. It was difficult enough in London, where the play won raves before transferring to Broadway.
 ''We were not prepared for the degree the American audience might want to pull Nixon toward that,'' Mr. Langella said of the Tricky Dick caricature. ''After the first two or three previews I said to Grandage'' -- that would be Michael Grandage, the director -- '' 'They want me to become a clown. We have to ratchet this a little darker.' ''
 Mr. Grandage said he and Peter Morgan, the playwright, wanted to cast someone who had the presence that a role like this required.
 ''Peter and I were just very, very clear that we wanted to find an American actor of such stature that when they came onstage, it would be as close as you could come to a president coming onstage,'' Mr. Grandage said in a phone interview.
 Mr. Langella said he did far more research than he had ever done for a role, interviewing journalists and Nixon associates, visiting Nixon's childhood home and watching tapes of Nixon, including one that he enacts at the start of the show. Then, he said, ''I sort of put all the factual information away and allowed the visceral to take over.''
 Now onstage it's up to Michael Sheen, playing David Frost, to chase down and draw that visceral Richard Nixon out. Mr. Grandage described the play as a thriller. 
 The cat-and-mouse game of the news media is something Mr. Langella has had a chance to study recently, for his film roles as William S. Paley, the chief executive of CBS, in ''Good Night, and Good Luck,'' and, for that matter, Perry White, the editor of a major Metropolitan newspaper, in ''Superman Returns.''
 But the media interest him less than how people have to act out the roles the media define for them. Mr. Langella cites Barack Obama as skillful in this kind of theater. Nixon, he said, was not; no matter how hard he or his handlers tried, he could not hide that he was ''an unbelievable bag of neuroses.''
 It's curious: What is admired as authenticity in a politician could just be seen as incompetence in an actor. But Mr. Langella said he identified with Nixon nevertheless.
 ''I feel empathetic towards him,'' he said. ''Not sympathy, but tremendous empathy.'' 
 In 1989 Mr. Langella wrote an essay for The New York Times about actors and their demons: the fear of unemployment, the anxiety of keeping up images and the intense self-loathing that comes with wanting to be liked. 
 Many of the insecurities discussed in the essay sound remarkably like those of Mr. Morgan's Nixon, who growls to Mr. Frost in a drunken (and fictional) late-night phone call about ''the people whose respect we really wanted. Really craved. And isn't that why we work so hard now?'' 
 Mr. Langella, 69 and still maintaining his catlike charm, said that he was not the same person he had been when he wrote that essay, that he was now much more at peace. But when he teaches acting classes, he said, he sees parts of his younger self in his students.
 ''They are so twisted and tormented with stuff I let go years ago,'' he said. ''I was obsessive then, deeply in love and then out of love.''
 There are a few known facts here -- a marriage, two children, a divorce, a reputation as a tomcat, an affair with Whoopi Goldberg -- but he will not give specifics. Like his Nixon, Mr. Langella is an agile interviewee, taking the conversation toward anything but the specifics of his nonacting life. 
 ''My agenda, quite honestly,'' he said at one point, ''is to speak about as honestly and directly to you as I can, but to reveal as little as I care to about my personal life.''
 But even sticking to abstractions he spoke animatedly about the distractions in his youth and early middle age, when he was ''driven by my sexual energies or my ambition or my competitive urges or my desire for things.''
 He clearly has not abandoned his ambition, nor, one assumes, any of those other things. But it's a matter of control, he said, in a curious little echo of the character he is portraying at the Jacobs: ''You get to a particular point where you say, 'I'm not going to let them push me around.' ''

HEADLINE: In the Beverly Hills Style: Candidate's $400 Coiffure

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19 

 BODY:
Presidential campaigns spend all sorts of money on all sorts of things. Television advertisements. Polls. Big-time consultants. Coaches for the news media. Chartered airplanes. High-priced Beverly Hill haircuts for the candidate. 
 Wait, high-priced Beverly Hills haircuts for the candidates?
 John Edwards, the North Carolina Democrat, announced on Thursday that he was reimbursing his campaign $800 to cover what his aides said was the cost of two haircuts -- yes, you read that correctly -- by a Beverly Hills barber, though, perhaps, the word stylist is more applicable. 
 A spokesman for the campaign, Eric Schultz, said that Torrenueva Hair Designs of Beverly Hills sent the bill for a haircut in February and a second last month to the Edwards campaign and that the campaign mistakenly paid it. Mr. Schultz said Mr. Edwards would reimburse the campaign. He would not say how a haircut could cost $400 or whether it might cover other expenses, too. The stylist, Joseph Torrenueva, said in an interview that his normal charge was $175 ''in my shop'' and that the extra fee was to go to where the candidate was, a practice he described as routine among his clients. Beyond that, he said, ''I really can't talk about it.''
 Mr. Edwards has presented himself in the Democratic field as an advocate of working-class Americans, lamenting the nation's growing economic disparity.
 Mr. Edwards was disparaged as ''the Breck Girl'' by Republicans when he ran for president in 2004. More recently, he was captured on camera, waiting for an interview to begin and presumably unaware that he was being taped, fussing with his hair for nearly two minutes. 
 That clip found its way to You Tube, with the song ''I Feel Pretty'' playing in the background. Posted on Nov. 8, 2006, it was viewed 289,288 times as of Thursday evening.
 When Bill Clinton was president, he once summoned a Los Angeles hair stylist to Air Force One to cut his hair while the plane sat on the tarmac in Los Angeles.
 Candidates are finding more gaffes and foibles posted on the Internet. Senator John McCain, a Republican hopeful, was captured on camera in South Carolina on Wednesday when he was asked about sending ''an air-mail message to Teheran.''
 ''Remember that old Beach Boys song 'Bomb Iran?' '' Mr. McCain asked and burst out with the first three notes of ''Barbara Ann,'' with slightly different words. ''Bomb, bomb, bomb,'' he sang.

HEADLINE: Airfare Cost Depends on Where You Buy

BYLINE: DAVID G. ALLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Are there differences in the price of air tickets depending on which country a ticket is issued? For example, if I fly from the United States to Japan, will it be cheaper to buy the tickets there rather than in the U.S.? 

 BODY:
Airfares can vary enormously from country to country. Price discrepancies depend on such factors as exchange rates, bilateral agreements between countries, and market forces like competition and capacity. For example, the price of an economy-class round-the-world ticket with the Oneworld airline alliance will be about $3,900 from New York, $2,565 from London, $2,640 from Paris and $3,111 from Bangkok.
In your case, it is more expensive to buy a round-trip ticket to Japan from the United States than vice versa. Quick visits to American Airlines' United States and Japan Web sites (www.americanairlines.jp/en) showed me a round-trip economy fare from New York to Tokyo for $1,279, compared with only $972 from Tokyo to New York for travel in May. (Of course, this means little if your departure country has to be the United States, rather than Japan.)
Nick Grealy, a reader in Kingston upon Thames, England, finds a similar price difference between New York and London. "I plan to travel from London to New York," he writes. "The lowest fare on Expedia.co.uk (with Virgin Atlantic) is 37 percent more than the fare quoted on Expedia.com from New York to London on the same dates with the same airline. Can I get the dollar fare from London?"
The answer is that you can buy the lower fare in each of these cases, but you must start out in the country where you buy your ticket.
Travelers who make several international stops are the best placed to benefit from anomalies in fares, especially traveling around Asia and the Pacific. As I reported, Hong Kong and Bangkok are good places to buy tickets for low-cost travel. Compare fares at cities along the desired itinerary, both at airline sites and online travel agents such as Zuji.com and Travelocity.com, which have several regional Web sites, and with local travel agents. --ROGER COLLIS

HEADLINE: Mayor's Death Forces Japan's Crime Rings Into the Light

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: NAGASAKI, Japan, April 20 

 BODY:
The shooting death this week of this city's popular mayor has left people puzzling over the shooter's motive and has set off a national outcry about a less savory aspect of Japanese society: its teeming criminal underworld.
 On Friday, passers-by left flowers on the sidewalk where Mayor Kazunaga Ito, who went by the name Itcho Ito in public life, was killed Tuesday evening by a member of an organized crime group. Citizens also lined up to write their condolences at Nagasaki's City Hall, where employees were wearing black dresses and neckties.
The brazenness of the slaying, in front of crowds of commuters at the city's main train station, shocked this nation, which takes pride in its normally safe streets. It has brought growing calls in national newspapers and among ordinary citizens for Japan's central government to take tougher steps to crack down on criminal groups.
 ''We can no longer let organized crime run rampant in Japan,'' said Toru Shioyama, 36, who visited the site of Mr. Ito's killing during his lunch break. ''I'm outraged.'' 
 Japan has some of the lowest crime rates in the world, yet it is not uncommon, especially in regional cities like this one, to see dark-suited gangsters openly swaggering down streets. Some gangs even announce their presence by hanging signboards outside their headquarters and carrying business cards.
 In all Japan, there were some 84,700 known members of organized criminal groups as of March, according to the National Police Agency. By contrast, the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that there are only 1,000 ''made'' members of the Mafia, America's best-known organized crime group.
 For decades, Japan's gangsters, known as yakuza, enjoyed a romanticized image here for their role in keeping crime under control. Historians say these groups often kept cozy relations with politicians and the police, and were a widely accepted part of the social fabric. But in recent years, public opinion has begun turning against them, as tougher economic times have driven the underworld to victimize regular Japanese more frequently, organized crime experts say.
 According to the police, Mr. Ito, 61, was shot by a member of the Suishinkai, a local branch of the 39,700-member Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest organized crime group. The killer, Tetsuya Shiroo, 59, has confessed to shooting Mr. Ito twice from behind with an American-made revolver, the police said.
 Mr. Shiroo's motives are not clear. At first, many here thought the killing might have been politically motivated. Some speculated that Mr. Ito might have angered Japan's murky far right with his opposition to nuclear weapons, a common stance in a city that was flattened by an American atomic bomb in World War II. In early 1990, another Nagasaki mayor was shot and wounded by a rightist after saying that the late Emperor Hirohito bore some responsibility for the war.
 However, the police now appear to be investigating money-related disputes. The local news media have focused on a four-year-old clash between Mr. Shiroo and the city of Nagasaki over a car accident. In that dispute, Mr. Shiroo visited City Hall about 30 times from 2003 to 2005 to demand up to 2.7 million yen, or about $23,000, for damages to his car that he claimed were from an accident at a city construction site, city officials said.
 Lawyers said such requests for reimbursement were a common form of extortion. However, the small amount of money involved, and the fact that Mr. Shiroo had not raised the matter with city officials for two years, made many wonder if there was not some larger, hidden issue. Adding to the mystery was the fact that Mr. Ito was in the final stretch of campaigning for re-election in Sunday's mayoral election, which he was widely expected to win.
 ''We really have no idea what was the reason'' for the slaying, said Yoshinobu Hashida, chief of the city's personnel section, which advises city officials on how to deal with gangster threats. ''There's no clear-cut explanation.''
 Another possibility is a dispute over public works projects, which lawyers and other organized crime experts call a common source of revenue for criminal groups. A letter signed by Mr. Shiroo and sent to a Tokyo-based broadcaster just before the shooting reportedly expressed anger at Nagasaki for denying a contract to a construction company with links to him. On Thursday, the broadcaster, TV Asahi, turned over the letter to the Nagasaki police.
 It is also unclear why Mr. Shiroo chose the mayor as his target. Mr. Shiroo did not name the mayor during the traffic accident dispute, said city officials, and the TV Asahi letter reportedly mentioned him only briefly. Toshiaki Hayashida, the mayor's chief secretary, said he believed that Mr. Ito had never met Mr. Shiroo.
 Some experts said the killing might have been an act of desperation by gangsters, who have come under increasing pressure as Japanese companies and local governments have stepped up efforts to end dealings with organized crime. In recent years, Nagasaki has passed new regulations requiring companies to report all contact with organized criminal groups, or be barred from bidding on public works contracts.
 Organized crime has also felt the pinch as Japan has reduced public works spending to rein in runaway budget deficits, say experts like Takashi Ozaki, a lawyer in Tokyo specializing in organized crime cases. Criminal groups have responded by increasingly turning to violence to intimidate local officials, Mr. Ozaki said.
 ''Incidents like the Nagasaki shooting show how tough it's getting for these groups,'' Mr. Ozaki said.
 The National Police Agency said it was contacted 2,391 times last year in connection with violence against local government employees, an increase of 27 percent over the past six years. In Nagasaki, before this week's shooting, city officials had been the victims of violence 13 times in the past four years, though not all of these involved members of organized criminal groups, said Mr. Hashida, the city personnel official.
 In one case, a member of an organized criminal group was arrested after threatening a city official while demanding reimbursement for injuries he claimed he had suffered by stepping in a trap that the city had laid to control the local population of wild boars.
 It is rare for a case to be as high profile, and as brutal, as Tuesday's killing. After Mr. Shiroo's arrest, the boss of the Suishinkai visited the Nagasaki police headquarters to report that the group was voluntarily disbanding, a possible sign that gangsters were bracing for a crackdown, the police said. 
 The police said the group had close to 100 members, making it the second-largest organized crime group in Nagasaki Prefecture, of which Nagasaki is the capital. Local police officials said that while they monitored the Suishinkai and other of the prefecture's 555 known gangsters, they were powerless to arrest members until they actually broke a law.
 ''We can only act if they do something wrong,'' said Yoshihiro Hara, a spokesman for the Nagasaki prefectural police. ''We have to observe the rule of law.''
 Meanwhile, at Mr. Ito's former campaign headquarters, activity began picking up again. On Thursday, the campaign announced that Mr. Ito's son-in-law, Makoto Yokoo, a 40-year-old reporter with no experience in politics, would run Sunday in Mr. Ito's place. 
 ''Sadly, some types of people resort to violence when they can't get their way,'' said Mr. Hayashida, the mayor's secretary. ''But we cannot let this stop us from pressing on.''

HEADLINE: Growing Unrest Posing a Threat To Nigerian Oil

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria 

 BODY:
There are few safe places left for oil companies in the Niger Delta, the epicenter of this country's petroleum industry.
 Armed rebel gangs have blown up pipelines, disabled pumping stations, and kidnapped over 150 foreign oil workers in the last year. Companies now confine employees to heavily fortified compounds, allowing them to travel only by armored car or helicopter.
One company has fitted bathrooms with steel bolts to turn them into ''panic'' rooms, if needed. Another has coated the pylons of a giant oil-production platform 80 miles offshore with waterproof grease to prevent attackers from climbing the rig. 
 The violence in the Niger Delta is likely to be one of the thorniest political problems for Nigeria's new president, to be chosen in the election April 21. Oil, after all, is the mainstay of Nigeria's economy, providing 65 percent of its revenue. 
 The events in Nigeria, the world's eighth-largest oil exporter, have rippled across energy markets, contributing to higher prices and tighter supplies. 
 [On Friday, gunmen attacked a boat carrying oil workers to an offshore rig in the delta, pushing up oil prices by more than $1.50, to $63.38 a barrel.] 
 The United States imports more than one million barrels of crude oil from Nigeria every day.
 Many analysts warn that tensions here could derail plans to boost oil production in this country of 140 million people. Already, a quarter of Nigeria's oil output has been shut down, costing an estimated $12 billion in lost sales in over the last year. Some foreign operators have abandoned oil fields, or left the country altogether. 
 ''I can't think of anything worse right now,'' said Larry Johnson, a former United States Army officer who was recently hired to toughen security at a site here operated by Eni, an Italian oil producer. ''Even Angola during the civil war wasn't as bad.''
 Violence is not new to the Niger Delta, a vast area of 40,000 square miles of swamps and creeks where the Niger River washes out into the Atlantic Ocean. The region, which produces most of the country's oil, is also one of the nation's poorest. 
 In the 1990s, there were occasional kidnappings. But at the time, recalled Chris Haynes, a senior Shell executive, ''you could usually get them released for a few bags of rice or a cow.'' 
 Since January 2006, however, violence in the delta has surged. So far in 2007, there have been at least 18 attacks against oil facilities or bases in the delta, according to Bergen Risk Solutions, a consultancy based in Bergen, Norway. 
 And about 70 foreigners have been abducted in 2007, although most have been released within weeks in exchange for ransoms, typically hundreds of thousands of dollars. Oil companies find themselves in an uneasy position, stuck in a crisis that they, in a sense, helped create. For years, human rights groups accused them of turning a blind eye to the corruption of Nigeria's successive military regimes while damaging the environment in the delta. 
 Some companies have acknowledged these past grievances but say they changed after Nigeria returned to civilian rule in 1999. 
 Still, gas flaring into the atmosphere remains a serious problem despite a government deadline to end the practice by 2008; few expect that deadline will be met. Also, oil spills continue to spoil the delta's fragile environment. Energy executives blame locals for sabotaging their pipelines either to steal the oil or to gain lucrative cleanup contracts.
 By all accounts, petroleum profits have brought huge benefits to this country's rulers, but few to its people. Oil companies typically keep 7 percent of the profits from oil sales; the government gets 93 percent.
 Nigeria ranks as one of the most corrupt countries in the world according to Transparency International, a Berlin-based anti-corruption group; 70 percent of the country's population lives on $1 a day or less. Life expectancy is 47 years.
 Between 1960 and 1999, more than $380 billion was stolen or wasted, according to Nuhu Ribadu, Nigeria's top anti-corruption official. In that period, the country produced over $400 billion worth of oil.
 In an effort to redistribute wealth, the government now gives 13 percent of the proceeds from oil sales to the producing states but there is little accountability of how these funds are spent. Much of it simply disappears, wasted by inefficient or corrupt local officials, according to a recent Human Rights Watch report. 
 The River States government, for example, had a budget of $1.3 billion in 2006, the report said. It includes transportation fees of $65,000 a day for the governor's office; $10 million for catering, entertainment, gifts and souvenirs; and $38 million for two helicopters. Health services received $22 million.
 ''Oil companies are caught in an impossible situation,'' said Chris Albin-Lackey, a researcher with Human Rights Watch. ''They cannot meet the expectations of the communities in which they operate. At the same time, you have a government unwilling to do anything about the delta.''
 Oil companies have all set up programs to build roads, hospitals or schools in their communities. Shell, for example, said it spends over $100 million each year on social and health programs in the Niger Delta. Exxon, which has set aside $21 million for similar projects in 2007, noted it had built 95 percent of the roads in the town of Eket, close to one of its operations.
 But in the absence of government services, executives say their programs alone cannot buy them sustained peace.
 ''The government should really be the one who looks after everybody else,'' said Basil Omiyi, Shell's managing director in Nigeria. ''I don't think the capital program of oil and gas companies can be the government in the Niger Delta.''
 John Chaplin, Exxon's top executive in Nigeria, said ''The demands are limitless.''
 Critics say governments in Abuja, the country's modern capital, have neglected the delta region and blame oil companies for being complicit in a system that ignores the communities where the oil is produced. 
 ''The situation here is deplorable,'' said John Owubokiri, an advocate for the rights of the delta states in Port Harcourt. ''The people are being shortchanged.''
 That message is now being delivered in a more forceful way than the largely nonviolent militancy of the past decade. A new group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, has emerged in the past year and claimed responsibility for many of the kidnappings and attacks against oil companies. 
 MEND wants more money for the delta states and has vowed to bring Nigeria's oil exports to a stop if its demands are not met. 
 ''We are more than capable of escalating the violence,'' the MEND spokesman, Jomo Gbomo, who regularly sends e-mail messages to the media, wrote in response to e-mailed questions. The group, he said, is prepared for ''a protracted military confrontation.''
 The violence has driven some companies away. Willbros, one of the world's largest independent contractors, left Nigeria last summer after nearly 45 years, because nine of its employees were held in the swamps for weeks. After their release, Willbros said the dangers in Nigeria ''exceed our acceptable risk levels.'' 
 After one of Shell's big export sites was bombed in February 2006, the company abandoned its operations in the Western part of the delta and shut half its production, or 500,000 barrels a day. In early April, Shell outlined plans to restart production within six months. Meanwhile, the government has been unable to quell the unrest, security consultants said. ''Nigeria's securityforces are ill equipped, poorly led, unmotivated, and outgunned,'' said Ian Pilcher, the head of Nigerian operations for ArmorGroup, a British security consultant. 
 But Nigerian officials say they do not want to escalate tensions by sending more troops to the region. 
 ''It's definitely not a first option,'' said Edmund Daukoru, Nigeria's oil minister, referring to a more forceful military response. 
 The lack of security has created demand for private security firms to help oil companies make conditions safer for their workers who are adjusting to a new lifestyle. For example, Triple Canopy, an American security firm founded shortly after the Iraq invasion, opened its first office outside of the Middle East in Lagos last summer. 
 While the attacks against oil companies have slowed recently, replaced largely by election violence, few analysts believe the militant movement will disappear soon.
 Just a few months ago, foreign employees in Port Harcourt, the center for oil operations in the delta, lived in apartments with their families and could relax at local bars, including one popular pub, Goodfellas. 
 But after a rash of attacks around town last year, families have packed up and gone home, while workers and executives have retreated inside fortified bases surrounded by high walls and razor wire.
 On a recent evening, about a dozen men, mainly Italians, settled at the mess inside one such campus here operated by Eni to watch a live soccer game from Rome on satellite television. The 50-acre compound houses offices, dormitories, and some guest houses; there are tennis courts and manicured lawns, a swimming pool and a new gym. 
 There is also a large field for soccer games between the company team and local soldiers. The cook, the food and the wine come from Italy.
 The Eni campus is an oasis compared with the rest of town, a chaotic cluster of five million people. But violence can visit here at any moment, as it did a few months ago when a cellphone-activated car bomb blew up just across the street. 
 ''It's sad what is going on here,'' said Marco Castelli, a manager at Eni, who moved to Nigeria last June. After years living alone in far-flung places like Kazakhstan, Congo and Iran, Mr. Castelli was looking forward to a quiet family assignment in Nigeria. His wife was about to quit her job as a marketing executive for a drug company in Italy to join him.
 But soon after he arrived, gunmen entered a bar in Aker Base, a slum outside of Port Harcourt, and kidnapped an Italian worker. An army sergeant was shot dead as he tried to stop the attackers. Later that day, soldiers returned to the scene and razed the village.
 The hostage was released the same week, but shortly after that event Mr. Castelli's wife scrapped her plans to join him. 
 ''The more the situation worsened,'' he said, ''the more the restrictions became tough.''
 Still, many workers here say they are undeterred by the violence and few are considering leaving. 
 Antonio Fiore, an engineer with Eni, has been confined to the Port Harcourt base since December. In his three decades with the company, Mr. Fiore helped build a refinery in Iraq in the 1970s, worked on a petrochemical plant near the Iranian town of Isfahan in 1989, and spent time in Kuwait after the first gulf war. He has been posted in Nigeria for the last three years. 
 ''What we're doing here is important,'' he said. ''I have been in many critical areas. But for us, what happened last year was a nightmare.''

HEADLINE: When a Student Is Mentally Ill

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Laws Limit Colleges' Options When a Student Is Mentally Ill'' (front page, April 19):
 As a psychiatrist who has consulted in the college mental health system for many years, I am aware of one weak link in the system that needs urgently to be repaired. 
 You report on April 19 that after being discharged from a psychiatric hospital, a judge ordered outpatient treatment for Seung-Hui Cho but that ''officials said they did not know whether Mr. Cho had received subsequent counseling.'' 
 In such circumstances, colleges should be empowered by law to require continuing mental health treatment, with periodic review by appropriate officials. This should be a condition of the student's continuing to attend the college. Ronald Pies, M.D. Lexington, Mass., April 19, 2007 The writer is a clinical professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine. To the Editor: 
 Your article describing laws limiting colleges' options dealing with mentally ill students reminded me of how my doctors handle privacy. They require me to sign a form releasing sensitive information to insurance companies and others they deem fit. 
 If I don't, insurance will not cover me. It goes to a central bank available to all insurers and can affect my ability to get life coverage in the future as well as other insurance. 
 Corporate America is not as timid as college administrators. As an experienced psychiatrist practicing in Harvard Square, I would like to make a simple suggestion to the colleges. Entering students ought to be required to sign a privacy waiver covering serious mental and other illnesses under certain clearly defined conditions. Refusal to sign would mean failure to matriculate. 
 While this might inhibit students from confiding certain matters, it would allow adults to deal with the obvious behaviors revealed by the severely mentally ill. 
 It is inconceivable that parents and concerned administrators are not informed and permitted to act upon students who fall down drunk, take dangerous drugs, make suicidal attempts, lose weight in anorexic proportions, fail to get out of bed and go to class or stalk or threaten anyone in the college community. 
 When I was a part-time university health service psychiatrist years ago, the psychotherapists talked too much. Now the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. William S. Appleton, M.D. Cambridge, Mass., April 19, 2007 The writer is an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. To the Editor:
 Re ''A Volatile Young Man, Humiliation and a Gun'' (column, April 19):
 Bob Herbert is right. How natural it is for adolescent boys and young men in this country to find violent solutions to the psychosocial problems inherent to growing up. Our culture offers it to them in the deluge of media swill that drenches us all.
 Of course it is popular, given the anesthetizing purpose it serves among those with shaky family and community connections. The magic of the gun rests in its holder's fleeting sense of omnipotence, so different from his actual life condition. 
 When we add the easy availability of handguns to this caldron, it sheds light on why, since 1960, there have been more than 800,000 murders in this country, with few victims having been slapped to death. 
 H. Rap Brown was a truth-teller when he said in the '60s that ''violence is as American as cherry pie.'' Our culture, with its political and economic priorities what they are, is the destructive enabler. Robert Fine Tempe, Ariz., April 19, 2007 The writer is a senior lecturer in religious studies and sociology at Arizona State University. To the Editor:
 Re ''Building a Better Lockdown,'' by Christopher Whitcomb (Op-Ed, April 20):
 Every classroom or major work area should have a sturdy door that can be locked quickly from the inside. If the door has a window, the occupants should hide in a spot so that a glance from the outside indicates an empty room. 
 There should be an institution-wide signal to indicate a lockdown like a sequence of siren blasts. 
 Part of the employee or student handbook should be instructions to follow if gunfire is inevitable. Although hiding is the natural instinct, perhaps statistically it is better to collectively do something, like throw things at the shooter, yell loudly, put a book under your shirt as some protection or rush the shooter with makeshift weapons.
 Some of these may take inordinate daring, but at least they may provide more possibility of surviving an attack. James D. Peck Monroe Township, N.J. April 20, 2007

HEADLINE: Colleges Relying on Lenders to Counsel Students

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN; Jonathan D. Glater contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Rachel Jones, a senior at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, recently was sitting through a student-loan workshop that university officials had told her was mandatory when an uneasy feeling kicked in. 
 The woman in the front of the classroom asked students to fill out forms with personal information -- including names, addresses and phone numbers of relatives, an employer and a friend. Ms. Jones recalled that she also talked about ''other loan companies'' that would saddle students with unfavorable rates if they decided to consolidate loans on graduation.
Unable to keep quiet, Ms. Jones raised her hand: ''I just said, excuse me, who are you and what is your affiliation?'' The woman identified herself as an employee of All Student Loan, a California-based lender. 
 Ms. Jones, a 22-year-old who has $17,000 in student loans, had unwittingly stumbled upon another undisclosed relationship between universities and loan companies. 
 Recent investigations have largely focused on incentives lenders give universities to get coveted placement on the preferred lending lists students use to take out loans when they enter college. But colleges also give lenders crucial access to students when they are graduating, using lenders to conduct exit counseling required under federal law for students who have taken out federally guaranteed student loans. 
 In some cases, loan company representatives come on campus and run sessions for seniors on loan repayment. In others, colleges direct students to loan company Web sites, including Wells Fargo, Citibank and Sallie Mae. And in many cases, the loan companies are pushing a product: their consolidation loans.
 Anne Prisco, the vice president for enrollment management at Loyola, defended the practice, saying the lenders allowed on campus were carefully selected. ''Every year when we have exit interviews we ask if they want to assist,'' Ms. Prisco said. ''They are just there to provide additional information.''
 Others say the access to students is improper. Heather McDonnell, the director of financial aid at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., said she thought using loan companies for exit counseling was ''absolutely'' inappropriate. 
 ''Behind every lender is a consolidation loan,'' Ms. McDonnell said. ''I don't allow anybody to come on my campus to come and do that. I just don't think it's a good idea. I think that information should be coming directly from the financial aid office.'' 
 Many students have various kinds of loans, and consolidation allows them to combine the loans to pay a single interest rate and make one monthly payment.
 Karen Gross, the president of Southern Vermont College and a professor of law at New York Law School, said depending on a student's prospective job, income and health, consolidating loans was often unwise. For example, she said, students who take certain public sector jobs may sign away available benefits if they consolidate federal loans. 
 ''There is no shortage of erroneous information that a student could receive in a group counseling session,'' Ms. Gross said. ''Student loan consolidation makes sense for many students, but for many students it is absolutely not the right choice.'' She added that ''the reason this is bothersome is that students are required to engage in exit interviews, and so lenders have a captive audience.''
 The reason exit interviews are mandatory is that the federal government wants to crack down on default rates. According to the Department of Education, exit counseling is intended to explain borrowers' rights and responsibilities, loan repayment and the consequences of default.
 Students who consider skipping the sessions are often threatened with severe consequences. At Loyola, an e-mail message from the financial aid office said, ''A HOLD will be placed on your account and will only be removed upon your attendance at one of the above sessions.'' A hold typically prevents a student from registering for classes or even receiving a diploma. 
 Many institutions send students to complete exit counseling online through Direct Loan Servicing, part of the Department of Education. But others do not. 
 Capella University, an online institution where the director of financial aid was recently put on leave for accepting consulting fees from a loan company, allows Collegiate Funding Services, a loan consolidation company, to conduct online exit sessions and introduce its ''consolidation product.'' 
 Through a spokeswoman, Capella said that ''as part of the online counseling process, students are asked by C.F.S. whether they have an interest in debt consolidation.''
 The University of Maryland Eastern Shore, according to a recent news release, allows at least one lender, Consolidation Resource Center, to conduct exit counseling. The same news release also announced the company's $10,000 donation to a university scholarship fund. University officials did not return repeated calls for comment.
 All Student Loan, which ran exit interviews at Loyola, has conducted 25 counseling sessions at 20 institutions this year, said Joseph Booth, a company spokesman.
 The Indiana Institute of Technology directs students to complete exit counseling through OpenNet, an online service run by Sallie Mae, the nation's largest lender to college students. The Web sites of George Washington University and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland show that they do, too.
 Before signing in, students must agree to a disclaimer allowing Sallie Mae to use their data for purposes beyond loan processing, ''provided the proposed usage does not violate applicable laws and regulations or any confidentiality obligations.'' 
 The financial aid director at Indiana Tech, Teresa M. Vasquez, said, ''I didn't know that.'' She said Indiana Tech had been using Sallie Mae's exit counseling for three years. 
 Tom Joyce, a spokesman for Sallie Mae, said the students' data was shared with the students' lenders, whom they identify in the online exit counseling. Sallie Mae also uses their e-mail addresses to send solicitations from ''partners'' of Sallie Mae, ''where we have struck deals with industry-leading third parties, like Geico for insurance,'' Mr. Joyce said.
 At the end of the counseling, a link leads students to consolidate with Sallie Mae if they choose, Mr. Joyce said, but it is available only to students who have already chosen Sallie Mae as a lender.
 The Department of Education does not forbid the use of private lenders to conduct exit counseling, a spokeswoman, Jane Glickman, said. ''A lender may participate in exit counseling sessions offered by the school,'' she said, ''provided that the school maintains control of the session and school staff members are present.'' 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the education committee, is examining exit counseling as part of an investigation into student lending. 
 Mr. Kennedy said in a statement, ''When schools refer students to these counseling services, they should be able to rely on honest advice about their financial future -- not be subjected to unexpected marketing pitches from lenders.''
 Ms. Prisco of Loyola said that next year the university would consider making it clearer that the sessions were conducted by lenders. ''I'm not saying that maybe we can't make things a little more transparent,'' she said. 
 Weeks after her exit counseling at Loyola, Ms. Jones is still marveling over the session. She wrote an opinion column in the student newspaper, The Los Angeles Loyolan, denouncing the workshop as ''nothing more than an hourlong advertisement.''
 ''It just seemed really shady and underhanded the way it was run,'' Ms. Jones said. ''I still feel like I was duped.''

HEADLINE: World Bank to Broaden Its Inquiry Into Wolfowitz

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
The World Bank's board of directors expressed ''great concern'' on Friday about the furor over Paul D. Wolfowitz's leadership as president, and they said their inquiry into his conduct would extend beyond the allegations of favoritism shown to his female companion at the bank.
 The board's action, announced after a meeting that started at midafternoon on Thursday and ended at 1:30 a.m. on Friday, increased the uproar consuming Mr. Wolfowitz, who has rejected demands from the bank's staff and from one of his own top deputies that he resign.
With Mr. Wolfowitz's future clouded, but little appetite on the board to force his ouster, officials at the bank said the board had decided to broaden and lengthen its investigation into Mr. Wolfowitz, possibly into next month, in the hope that he would quit or that the Bush administration would recognize that his situation had become untenable. 
 The board did not specify any issues to be examined, but it set up an ad hoc committee to look into ''possible violations of staff rules'' and ''a number of issues requiring further consideration.'' The implication seemed unmistakable.
 ''It was designed to be a very clear message that they're going to turn over everything and look under every rock,'' said a bank official who had been briefed on the board's meeting.
 Among the issues that bank officials said the board would look into are accusations that a top aide of Mr. Wolfowitz recently tried to curb the bank's support of contraception in Africa, allegations of selectivity in prosecuting ethics violations by the bank's integrity unit and supposed favoritism in granting large salaries to top Wolfowitz aides.
 In addition, the board said it would look into ''various public communications made by the bank'' on the controversy over Mr. Wolfowitz's role in arranging for a pay and promotion package for his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, when she was detailed to the State Department shortly after Mr. Wolfowitz became the bank's president in 2005.
 At issue, bank officials said, were statements to news organizations earlier this year that Mr. Wolfowitz had let top ethics officials handle Ms. Riza's transfer. These were contradicted by some of the ethics officials, who said they had not been involved in the pay increase that raised her salary to $193,590 from $132,660.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's reaction to the board's announcement was muted but defiant. A statement from his office said he ''welcomes the decision of the board to move forward and resolve this very important issue.'' Bank officials said the board had discussed the possibility of rendering some kind of verdict on Mr. Wolfowitz's conduct on the matter of Ms. Riza as early as next week, accompanied perhaps by a larger assessment of his tenure at the bank.
 But the board members were reportedly divided about whether a gesture of no confidence was the right strategy.
 Officials familiar with the board's deliberations, speaking anonymously because the issues were supposed to be confidential, said that some directors from Europe and Asia favored a tough rebuke, but that representatives from the United States, Canada and Japan were resisting that approach.
 Board members from Latin America were described as favoring Mr. Wolfowitz's departure, whereas African leaders are known to have mixed views. African leaders have been grateful that Mr. Wolfowitz has increased aid to their region. But they also fear that European antagonism toward him could jeopardize their future support from the bank.
 European officials said that British, French, German, Dutch and Nordic leaders feared a confrontation with the United States over Mr. Wolfowitz, who has received almost daily words of support from the White House this past week.
 The Europeans' hope, according to various officials, is that a delay by the executive board, coupled with its widening investigation, could force the Bush administration to drop its support, perhaps persuading him to leave voluntarily.
 ''The steady view of the Europeans, led by the Germans, is that Wolfowitz's position is untenable,'' said a senior European official. ''They know that people at the Treasury Department agree, but that it will take time to convince George Bush. If the Europeans force the issue now, it becomes a clash.''
 Several bank officials said the situation was extremely delicate because Mr. Bush would not want an ouster of a onetime pillar of the administration at a time when Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is also under fire.
 As a result, this official said, it could take some weeks for Mr. Wolfowitz's fate to be decided. ''What all sides are doing is playing for time,'' he said. 
 Another factor, bank officials said, was the importance of discussing with the White House the question of whether Mr. Bush would be able to name a successor to Mr. Wolfowitz if he leaves before the end of his five-year term. While it is customary for the American president to name the leader of the bank, European leaders have been seeking a reconsideration of that practice.
 Officials also noted the bank's need to raise $30 billion from wealthy countries over the next three years for low-cost loans and grants to the world's poorest countries.
 So far, the wealthy countries have pledged the money, but all have fallen behind in fulfilling their commitments, and there are fears that Mr. Wolfowitz's difficulties may make raising the money harder, especially in Europe.
 A large amount of the discontent over Mr. Wolfowitz has focused on his top aides, Robin Cleveland and Kevin Kellems, both of whom worked with him on defense issues in the Bush administration. Bank officials have claimed that they have been given too much power and that their salaries, in excess of $200,000, are too high.
 But other complaints focus on other aides, including Juan J. Daboub, a former finance minister of El Salvador who is one of two top deputies to Mr. Wolfowitz; and Ana Palacio, a former foreign minister of Spain, who is general counsel and vice president.
 Documents have surfaced indicating that Mr. Daboub recently omitted language supporting contraceptives on family planning programs in Madagascar, and bank officials charge that he has been trying to undercut such programs for poor countries in general.
 Mr. Daboub, in an e-mail message to The New York Times, denied that he was seeking to change the policies. Mr. Wolfowitz gave similar assurances in a meeting of his own vice presidents earlier this week, bank officials said. But they said this matter would now be investigated by the bank's board.
 In addition, the bank's staff association asked the bank's integrity unit earlier this year to investigate the matter of Ms. Riza's salary. But the head of the unit sent an e-mail message back to the staff that investigating Mr. Wolfowitz's office was beyond its jurisdiction. This issue, too, is to be investigated by the bank's board, officials said.

HEADLINE: China's Automakers, With Beijing's Prodding, Show Alternative-Fuel Cars

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 20 

 BODY:
Chinese automakers, under pressure from the government to produce more fuel-efficient cars, unveiled an unexpectedly broad array of prototypes for fuel-cell cars, gasoline-electric hybrid cars and electric battery cars at the Shanghai auto show on Friday.
 The variety and sophistication of the cars showed a striking improvement not just since the last Shanghai auto show two years ago, when Chinese automakers demonstrated scant technological innovation, but even in the months since the Beijing auto show last November. 
Universities and technical institutes across China have started advanced vehicle propulsion research programs, combining strong government financial backing with China's growing ranks of skilled engineers.
 China, worried about severe air pollution and rising dependence on imported oil, has already imposed more stringent fuel economy standards than the United States -- although not as strict as the semi-voluntary standards in the European Union.
 China plans to tighten its standards considerably next year. It has raised its consumption tax to as much as 20 percent on gas guzzlers, while cutting it to 1 percent for cars with small fuel-sipping engines. And it is studying the possibility of tax incentives for buyers of hybrids.
 Multinational automakers like General Motors and Volkswagen have begun cooperating closely with Chinese joint venture partners on the development of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles. Larry Burns, G.M.'s vice president for research and development, said the company was in talks with a Chinese joint venture partner on sharing hydrogen fuel-cell technology as well.
 Xu Liuping, the chief executive of Changan Automobile in Chongqing, said the Chinese auto industry was hard working to save energy. 
 ''The speed will be accelerated because available energy supplies are dwindling and because of the environmental protection aspect,'' Mr. Xu said in an interview at the Shanghai auto show. 
 Changan showed a hybrid gasoline-electric minivan here. Mr. Xu said that he had lined up local governments that promised to use it, making it possible for Changan to start manufacturing the vehicle next year.
 Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, and Nick Reilly, the president of G.M.'s Asian and Pacific regional operations, met on Thursday with senior Chinese officials in Beijing to discuss the company's energy efficiency plans, Mr. Reilly said. The Chinese government has not chosen among options like electric battery cars, fuel cells, hybrids and ethanol combustion, but wants the industry to move quickly to find the best approach and adopt it.
 ''It's absolutely at the top of the agenda'' of the Chinese leadership, Mr. Reilly said.
 Western environmentalists have long speculated whether China may actually leapfrog the West in personal transportation by embracing new automotive technologies before the country's oil and auto industries can become too wedded to internal combustion engines.
 The odds of such a leapfrogging have eroded because nobody has yet surmounted the technological obstacles that prevent a broad switch from gasoline technology to hydrogen fuel cells, said An Feng, the executive director of the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation in Beijing.
 Japanese companies, particularly Toyota and Honda, are already far ahead in the hybrid gasoline-electric designs that have proved more attractive lately to Chinese companies than fuel cells, said Kelly Sims Gallagher, the director of the Energy Technology Innovation Project at Harvard. Japanese companies also control many crucial patents on hybrid technology.
 Multinational automakers face repeated demands from Chinese joint venture partners to share the most advanced technology available. Katsumi Nakamura, the president and chief executive of Dongfeng Motor, a joint venture in Hubei Province between Nissan and the Dongfeng Group of China, said the Dongfeng side had tried to negotiate an agreement that would require the sharing of the latest technology.
 But at Nissan's insistence, the final pact calls only for the sharing of ''appropriate'' technology. 
 Auto executives are reluctant to mention the illegal copying of technology in China, a problem that discouraged Chrysler from even trying to build minivans in China in the 1990s. China's vehicle market is now the second largest in the world, after the United States, and still expanding. It grew another 34 percent in the first two months of this year compared with the period a year earlier. Automakers have decided to risk the occasional piracy of existing designs but are still wary of sharing future technologies.
 G.M. has been the multinational automaker most willing to share designs with Chinese partners, and Mr. Wagoner reaffirmed in an interview with reporters on Friday that G.M. plans to maintain this policy.
 Mr. Burns said that G.M.'s lawyers believe that the automaker can share fuel-cell technology with a joint venture partner, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, even though G.M. had collaborated with the federal government in the United States on fuel-cell research. American export control laws are aimed only at preventing the transfer to foreign powers of technology with potential military applications, while not restricting the transfer of purely civilian technology.
 Mr. Burns said, ''It's in the best interest of the United States for China to diversify its energy resources.''
 Brushing aside a question about the possibility of illegal copying, Mr. Burns added, ''We have a good partnership with S.A.I.C. and a lot of trust -- at some point you just have to rely on your relationships.''
 Mr. Wagoner announced at the auto show on Friday that G.M. was far enough along in designing fuel cells that it could spend the next three or four years doing engineering work on a production process for them. G.M. showed a fuel-cell vehicle here that in some ways is more advanced than a model shown at the Detroit auto show three months ago. The prototype here relies more on hydrogen and, unlike the Detroit show prototype, does not include a small gasoline engine as a backup.
 China ''may very well be the first country to develop a broad-based fuel cell infrastructure,'' Mr. Wagoner said.
 S.A.I.C. and Chery each showed prototypes here of fuel cell cars that they said they had developed on their own. Haima, a less-known Chinese automaker, showed an electric battery car.
 Mr. Burns said that China was especially well suited for fuel-cell technology because the cities are densely populated and there is little driving between cities. 
 China is also the world's leading steel producer, and the production process for steel produces a significant amount of hydrogen gas as a byproduct, which could be stored and used for cars. Steel mills currently vent the hydrogen into the atmosphere.

HEADLINE: Bush Defends Troop Buildup in Iraq, Claiming Progress in War

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: EAST GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., April 20 

 BODY:
President Bush turned to visual aids on Friday to promote his troop buildup in Iraq, using maps and photographs on a wide electronic screen to assert that in Baghdad, ''the direction of the fight is beginning to shift.'' 
 The speech, to an audience of high school students and members of a civic group devoted to studying world affairs, was part of an intense White House public relations effort to persuade Americans -- and, more important, Democrats in Congress -- to give Mr. Bush's troop buildup a chance. Democrats are trying to use an Iraq war spending bill to force the president to bring troops home, and Mr. Bush has promised to veto it.
On the second day of a two-day outside-the-Beltway swing, Mr. Bush laid out in his most specific terms to date what he viewed as improvements in Iraq. ''So far, the operation is meeting expectations,'' he said, at one point quoting an unnamed Middle East scholar who, Mr. Bush said, drew a contrast between ''the gloomy despair in Washington and the cautious sense of optimism in Baghdad.''
 But Mr. Bush said that since the security operation began in Baghdad ''we have seen some of the highest casualties of the war,'' and his visuals included an image of one of Wednesday's bombings in Baghdad.
 Bombs killed at least 171 people on Wednesday in the deadliest day in the capital since before the American-led security plan for the city took effect two months ago.
 On Capitol Hill, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, took to the Senate floor to defend his assessment, made Thursday, that ''this war is lost,'' a comment Republicans have seized upon. ''The longer we continue down the president's path, the further we will be from responsibly ending this war,'' Mr. Reid said Friday. In Michigan, Mr. Bush chided Democrats for suggesting they had an ''alternative strategy,'' adding, ''Withdrawal is not a strategy.'' 
 Like a general outlining his battle plan, the president delivered a step-by-step analysis of the conflict in Baghdad, Anbar Province and the outskirts of Baghdad. He began with a map that used red triangles to pinpoint the location of joint security stations, posts in Baghdad where American and Iraqi forces are supposed to work to root out terrorists. 
 ''Day by day, block by block, Iraqi and American forces are making incremental gains in Baghdad,'' the president said, adding, ''Displaced families are beginning to return home. And the number of sectarian murders in Baghdad has dropped by half since the operation began.'' 
 Death squad killings have dropped by half, according to the United States military, but bombings, which have mainly been directed at Shiites, have increased in Baghdad.

HEADLINE: Running With Scissors

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Whether or not the country is ready to elect a woman president or a black president, it's definitely not ready for a metrosexual in chief.
 In presidential politics, it's all but impossible to put the man into manicure. Be sensitive, but not soft. Effete is never effective. Not much has changed since George H. W. Bush drove his New Hampshire campaign off the road by requesting ''a splash'' more coffee at a truck stop.
 John Kerry sank himself by windsurfing in spandex and ordering a cheese steak in Philly with Swiss instead of Cheez Whiz. 
 We haven't reached the point where we can handle a green-tea-soy-latte-drinking, self-tanning-sea-salt-mango-body-wrapping, Norah-Jones-listening, yoga-toning chief executive.
 Bill Clinton sometimes flirted with metrosexuality, with Zegna ties, Christophe haircuts, Donna Karan suits and keen anima, but the heterosexual beat out the metrosexual.
 Americans have revered such homely leaders as Abe Lincoln. They seem open to balding pates like Rudy's and flattops like Jon Tester's. They don't want self-confidence to look like self-love. 
 John Edwards has reminded us that even -- or especially -- in the age of appearances, you must not appear to care too much about appearances.
 When you spend more on a couple of haircuts than Burundi's per capita G.D.P. , it looks so vain it makes Paul Wolfowitz's ablutions spitting on his comb look like rugged individualism.
 Following his star turn primping his hair for two minutes on a YouTube video to the tune of ''I Feel Pretty,'' Mr. Edwards this week had to pay back the $800 charged to his campaign for two shearings at Torrenueva Hair Designs in Beverly Hills. He seems intent on proving that he is a Breck Girl -- and a Material Boy. 
 He did not pony up for the pricey bills from Designworks Salon in Dubuque, Iowa, or the Pink Sapphire spa in Manchester, which offers services for men that include the ''Touch of Youth'' facial, as well as trips ''into the intriguing world of makeup.'' The Edwards campaign calls makeup a legitimate expense.
 Speaking of roots, my dad, a police detective who was in charge of Senate security, got haircuts at the Senate barbershop for 50 cents. He cut my three brothers' hair and did the same for anyone else in the neighborhood who wanted a free clip job. Even now, Mr. Edwards could get his hair cut at the Senate barbershop for $21 or the Chapel Hill Barber Shop near his campaign headquarters for $16. 
 So it's hard for me to understand how a guy could spend $400 without getting Bergdorf Blonde highlights. (The tabloids claim that Brad and Jen used to get matching streaks.) And don't campaign donors get snippy about sponsoring tonsorial treats? 
 Someone who aspires to talk credibly about the two Americas can't lavish on his locks what working families may spend on electricity in a year. You can't sell earnestness while indulging in decadence.
 Mr. Edwards, the son of a mill worker, moved from a $5.2 million, six-bedroom Federal mansion in Georgetown to a 28,000-square-foot behemoth in North Carolina with a basketball court, a squash court, two stages and a swimming pool.
 His 25-year-old daughter, Cate, a former editorial assistant for Vanity Fair, co-founded Urbanista, an online Rolodex that dispenses advice for ''hip'' girls in Manhattan, offering to be a ''bestie'' (a best friend) and answer questions like ''Where should I go to get my Marc Jacobs shoes reheeled?'' and ''Does anyone know the best place to get a really great haircut?'' One salon the site recommends is Warren-Tricomi, where Edward Tricomi says haircuts range from $121 to $300.
 The cost of grooming hair is peanuts compared with the cost of grooming an image. Hillary is paying a fortune to try to buy the secrets of likability. Her financial reports for the first three months of 2007 show debts to consulting firms of $447,000. 
 John McCain, who's supposed to be giving it to us straight, has a jaw-dropping herd of consultants to tell him how to do that. Dubbed ''the 2007 Full Employment Act for Campaign Consultants,'' the McCain crew spent $645,000 on fund-raising consultants in the first quarter and $400,000 on political consultants in key states (four in South Carolina alone). His top political adviser, John Weaver, got more than $60,000 in just three months.
 Obviously, there's a lot of waste in political campaigns. But you don't have to be as flinty as Mitt Romney -- who has made his staff triple up at cheap hotels -- to know there's something special about throwing away money on vanity.
 All the haircuts in the world may not save John Edwards from a blowout.

HEADLINE: Two Cases Prove Test for Bush's Unwavering Loyalty

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Eric Lipton contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
Time and time again, President Bush has stood by his most embattled but loyal lieutenants despite loud calls for their heads, at times defying the established physics of Washington (rapidly diminishing support in one's own party times the number of instances in which one has failed to convincingly explain away accusations of incompetence or malfeasance equals the certainty of rapid resignation).
 But Mr. Bush's ability to turn aside that kind of pressure is now facing a serious test as he confronts what to do about Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and Paul D. Wolfowitz, the president of the World Bank. 
How Mr. Bush moves to resolve the situations is being watched closely in Democratic and Republican circles for what it says about his standing in the capital's new power dynamic, as a late-term president with low approval ratings and a hostile and increasingly assertive Congress. 
 They are two very different cases in two very different worlds: Mr. Wolfowitz faces questions about favoritism toward his girlfriend; Mr. Gonzales is dealing with bipartisan criticism about his competence and questions about whether the Justice Department dismissed several federal prosecutors for political reasons.
 In each case Mr. Bush is standing by a loyalist with an evaporating base of support and a serious challenge to his credibility even among Republicans. And, two Republicans close to the administration said, in the case of Mr. Gonzales, even some of Mr. Bush's close aides think that his resignation would best serve the administration but do not find a like-minded view from the president, who is personally close to the attorney general. 
 Yet, in a mark of his dwindling political capital, Mr. Bush has so far left Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Wolfowitz mostly to fend for themselves, pledging his continued confidence in them, but in each case saying it would fall to them to build back support among their core constituencies. And neither, to say the least, has made any visible progress.
 Mr. Bush's unwavering -- some say stubborn -- sense of loyalty has at times helped him to build support within his own party. But it has also angered his fellow party members, most notably when he refused to cut loose Donald H. Rumsfeld as defense secretary as the Iraq war ground along and then forced him out after the 2006 elections, when many Republicans complained it was too late to do any political good.
 ''Bush certainly goes against the grain of the cardinal rule of Washington politics, which is get rid of damage that can hurt the president and the presidency,'' said Hedrick Smith, author of ''The Power Game: How Washington Works.'' 
 ''The other rule of the power game,'' Mr. Smith added, ''is to hang on; the president's got to look strong and can't look weak or the sharks will be in the water, and they will go after every chunk they can.''
 Throughout his presidency, Mr. Bush has seemed to keep the latter point top of mind, often projecting welcome strength to supporters in times of siege. But now there is some question of whether that same projection of fortitude in these circumstances is driving supporters away from him at a time when the White House needs all the friends it can get. 
 On Friday, one day after Mr. Gonzales scored low marks from members of both parties for his testimony on Capitol Hill, Republicans seemed to have soured on him still more, voicing fears that his inability to rebuild credibility would ultimately harm administration efforts to nominate judges and push terrorism initiatives.
 ''The nation would be better served by fresh leadership at the Justice Department,'' Representative Adam H. Putnam, Republican of Florida and chairman of the House Republican Conference, said Friday.
 Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said in a statement: ''I think that the attorney general should take the weekend to consider Thursday's hearing and to determine whether he can reconstitute the Department of Justice and be an effective leader there If he and the president decide that he cannot be an effective leader moving forward, then he should resign.''
 Some Republicans close to the White House predicted he would do just that, but administration officials denied the reports, and one Justice Department official said that no matter how harsh the criticism of Mr. Gonzales during the hearing Thursday, there was at least some relief that Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, did not formally call for him to step down.
 The spectacle of Republican senators harshly questioning Mr. Gonzales in a televised hearing came roughly a week after officials at the World Bank heckled Mr. Wolfowitz with calls to resign. While the two cases have very different elements, both are feeding into Democratic assertions that the administration is adrift without an ethical compass.
 Administration officials said the fate of Mr. Wolfowitz, who does not otherwise have a huge store of support from the neo-conservatives who once viewed him as an ally, would ultimately rest with the international board of directors of the World Bank over which it exerts only so much control. And one senior official, who requested anonymity to speak frankly, said that even if the White House believed Mr. Gonzales had done nothing wrong, the handling of the prosecutor dismissals and his incomplete explanations had created serious challenges for him and Mr. Bush's desire to protect him.
 ''It served up a political combo-Grand Slam Denny's breakfast to be feasted on,'' the official said.

HEADLINE: French Voters Feeling Frustrated Despite a Not-So-Bad Economy

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
THE French presidential election, which has its first round tomorrow, features a dozen candidates, none of whom seem to have much good to say about the performance of the man who is leaving office after 12 years in power, Jacques Chirac. 
 A look at the economic performance of the country under Mr. Chirac does not easily explain the antipathy. Unemployment remains high, but it is lower than it was when he took office. Economic growth has lagged that of Britain and the United States, but it has outpaced that of Germany.
But there is a widespread feeling that the country has not done much to confront its real problems, which include a two-tier system that leaves many with secure jobs and guaranteed pensions while others -- particularly younger people and those from the poor suburbs of Paris -- have trouble finding work.
 All the major candidates have come up with proposed ways to lower unemployment, but have been reluctant to discuss how to pay for them. Talk of reform tends to be gentle, with many in France fearful that reforms could lead to dismantling the system that has promised them good retirement benefits. But at the same time, they are concerned about France's ability to compete if it does not change. The balance-of-payments surplus Mr. Chirac inherited has turned into a deficit, albeit a much smaller one than that of the United States. 
 Instead, much of the debate has centered on issues of national pride and identity.
 Tomorrow's voting will narrow the field to two. The favorites to survive to the second round are Nicolas Sarkozy, the former interior minister who famously called young Arab rioters ''scum,'' and Segolene Royal, the Socialist candidate who has pushed for government subsidies to hire unemployed youths. 
 A centrist challenger, Francois Bayrou, is also given a chance to slip into the top two, and some think the right-winger Jean-Marie Le Pen could confound the experts by getting into the runoff this time as he did in 2002.
 One reason for the hesitancy to offer really specific programs has been France's national debt, which has risen sharply under Mr. Chirac, from less than half of gross domestic product to nearly two-thirds. That is about the same figure as in the United States, but far higher than Germany, where debt is about 40 percent of G.D.P.
 Among people 25 to 49 years old, French figures show that unemployment has fallen to 7.6 percent from more than 10 percent when Mr. Chirac took over. But the rate among those under 25 is still more than 21 percent. Businesses routinely denounce the 35-hour workweek, approved in 1998 as a way of creating more jobs, but any efforts to repeal it would ignite labor unrest.
 During Mr. Chirac's terms, the French economy grew at an average rate of 2.1 percent a year, far below the 2.8 percent rate in Britain but surpassing the 1.5 percent rate in Germany.
 As a result, the per capita G.D.P. in France came to $36,463 last year. That is only 82 percent of the comparable figure in the United States, and 93 percent that of Britain, but it is higher than the figure in Germany.

HEADLINE: Labor Rights Issues Are Stalling Trade Pacts

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
Hopes for a bipartisan agreement between the Bush administration and Congress leading to approval of several pending trade pacts have dissolved in a burst of charges and countercharges over the issue of labor rights.
 Administration officials and leading Democrats said there was still a chance for a compromise that could clear the way for passage of the trade deals and even for extension of President Bush's authority to negotiate a global trade accord and receive an expedited vote in Congress.
But the optimism heard last month has vanished and been replaced by acrimony reflected in a sharp exchange this week between business groups, who were supporting the administration, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 ''I really thought that everyone was on board with this,'' Mr. Rangel said, referring to his statements last month that the administration and Republicans in Congress were open to labor guarantees. 
 ''But there are some people,'' Mr. Rangel said, ''who hate unions so much, they can't see their way clear to supporting this provision.''
 A failure to approve the four trade deals -- with Colombia, Panama, Peru and South Korea -- could end the possibility of trade negotiations for the rest of Mr. Bush's term and deal a blow to any chances of a global trade accord. 
 Without an agreement in the Democratic-led Congress on the president's so-called fast-track negotiating authority, which expires June 30, the administration would not be able to bring any global trade deal before lawmakers and get an up-or-down vote.
 Trade negotiations among 180 countries have been foundering since last summer, but the United States has joined with Europe, India and Brazil to try to revive them. More talks are expected next week in Washington, but trade officials said that the impasse between the Democrats and the administration on labor rights has clouded their chances.
 At issue is the Democratic demand that pending trade deals with Colombia, Panama, Peru and South Korea include a provision guaranteeing certain rights for labor in the trading partner countries, including a ban on child and slave labor and the right to organize.
 In addition, the Democrats want the accords to endorse general labor protections adopted by the International Labor Organization, like the right to organize.
 The Bush administration, backed by business groups, contends that this Democratic demand could lead to trading partners suing to overturn basic American labor practices, like teenage summer jobs or work on farms, or the practice in some American states of prisoners making consumer goods.
 Another fear is that governments in Latin America, perhaps inspired by anti-American figures like President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, might use trade deals to try to overturn ''right to work'' laws in states, which bar employers from requiring workers to join unions.
 ''Subjecting our labor system to foreign challenge is simply not something to which we can agree,'' said John Engler, a former Republican governor of Michigan who is president of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
 ''For state constitutions or laws to be subject to a foreign nation's challenge would be unacceptable,'' Mr. Engler said. 
 The United States Chamber of Commerce sided with Mr. Engler but suggested that there was still a possibility of compromise.
 Mr. Rangel and other Democrats said that the concern of Mr. Engler and other business leaders was bogus, noting that under the Democratic proposal only those laws that have an impact on trade might be challenged.
 He added that he was ''astounded'' that Mr. Engler would ''go to such lengths to jeopardize the hard work of so many in Congress and the administration who are negotiating these issues.''
 Republicans in Congress have tried to stay out of the fight between Mr. Rangel and the business groups. Both Representative Jim McCrery, a Louisiana Republican who is the ranking Republican member of House Ways and Means, and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, ranking Republican of the Senate Finance Committee, have said they were convinced that a compromise could be reached if the attacks stop.
 Administration officials have not spoken about Mr. Rangel's dispute with the National Association of Manufacturers, other than to say that they agree with the business groups. 
 Organized labor sides with the Democrats, but officials at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. say that while the Republican fear of an effort to change American labor laws is far-fetched, there would be an advantage to the International Labor Organization putting pressure on the United States to change some laws.
 ''At the end of the day, no American change in U.S. labor laws is going to come through a bilateral trade agreement with Peru,'' said Thea Lee, chief international economist of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''But putting these provisions into a bilateral agreement does put additional pressure on the United States government.''
 Ms. Lee and others noted that past trade agreements, like one with Jordan signed at the end of the Clinton administration and approved during President Bush's first year in office, had labor provisions that are similar to the ones the Democrats are seeking.
 Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said the administration's concern was ''a false issue'' because only governments could bring challenges to American labor laws.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Levin said the Democrats were still pressing for environmental protections and other issue to be put in the trade deals before Congress.
 ''I think some in the administration doubt that Democrats are united on this,'' he said. ''We believe that putting worker rights in to trade agreements is a critical piece of shaping globalization in the world today.''

HEADLINE: China Adds Billionaires With I.P.O.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 20 

 BODY:
The 52-year-old Chinese farmer turned developer is as plain as the company's English name: Country Garden. But there was nothing ordinary about his company's debut Friday on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. 
 Friday morning, at 9:30 a.m., shares of Country Garden soared 35 percent on the opening day of trading in one of China's hottest initial public offerings of the year. When trading ended, this little-known real estate company based in southern China was valued at $15 billion, making the family of Yang Guoqiang, a dirt-under-the-fingers property tycoon, perhaps the richest in China.
In many ways, Country Garden's public offering -- which raised about $1.6 billion, or as much as Google's 2004 stock offering raised in the United States -- is just the latest symbol of China's meteoric rise, and this country's continuing stock market fever.
 After more than two decades of spectacular economic growth, fueled mostly by building factories that export low-cost goods, China has a rising number of entrepreneurs who are forming private companies, going public and getting extremely rich. 
 ''The general economic environment here has unleashed this tremendous entrepreneurial spirit,'' said Jing Ulrich, chairwoman of China equities at JPMorgan. ''People who in the past saw their ambitions stifled are now seeing them realized. They're going public.''
 There are Internet pioneers, like Robin Li of Baidu and Ma Huateng of Tencent; billionaire retailers, like Huang Guangyu of Gome; and real estate barons like Xu Rongmao of Shimao, Zhu Mengyi of Hopson and Country Garden's Yang Guoqiang, who told journalists a few months ago that for years he planted rice, tended cows and mixed cement before founding Country Garden in 1997.
 Now, his company is a virtual assembly line of home building for China's raidly growing middle class. Mr. Yang's genius is that he has a created a Wal-Mart approach to housing development for the middle class.
 Mr. Yang could not be reached for comment Friday and rules on public listing prevent company executives from promoting their stocks.
 The company has the backing of some of Wall Street's biggest investment bankers, including Morgan Stanley and UBS, and its profits this year are expected to reach $500 million, putting Country Garden's earnings in league with the world's biggest corporations.
 In an odd twist to his rags-to-riches tale, in 2005 Mr. Yang gave all of his shares in Country Garden to his daughter, Yang Huiyan, now 25, who will someday run the company. After Friday's listing, those shares are worth about $9 billion, which probably makes her China's wealthiest individual.
 Zhang Yin, the 50-year-old woman who controls Nine Dragons Paper, a company that recycles American waste paper and sells it to factories here in China, is far behind at about $3 billion. Her company went public early last year.
 The richest person in China last year, according to Forbes, was Huang Guangyu of the privately controlled Gome, the giant electronics retailer. He was said to be worth $2.3 billion, but was easily eclipsed Friday by the heirs of Country Garden.
 That makes Ms. Yang, who studied in the United States and owns 60 percent of Country Garden, richer even than George Soros, Steven P. Jobs of Apple and Rupert Murdoch.
 Her fortune was made possible, of course, by a global investment frenzy for all things Chinese, particularly stocks. 
 Last year, Hong Kong's stock market raised more money from public offerings than the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market combined, thanks to the listing of some of China's biggest state-owned banks.
 Hong Kong is getting more help this year from another Chinese lender, Citic Bank, which raised $5.4 billion yesterday in the world's biggest initial public offering yet in 2007, according to Bloomberg News.
 Shanghai's stock market has been even hotter, so hot in fact that the Chinese government is worried that a 200 percent jump in share prices in the last 16 months is beginning to look like a stock market bubble soon to burst.
 The sense of frenzy can be seen at brokerage houses throughout the country, where mostly elderly people congregate in front of huge red trading scoreboards or cheer their stocks on from the rows of plastic seats that resemble those found in an old bus terminal.
 With millions of Chinese now racing to invest in stocks at home, everyone wants to be listed and everyone wants to own a public company that has an opening-day pop reminiscent of the dot-com boom in the United States.
 ''This is the kind of thing that gets people excited, that encourages people to become more entrepreneurial in China,'' said Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance at Yale University who in recent months has been visiting Chinese entrepreneurs, including lesser-known ones like Jason Jiang, whose company puts screens with advertisements in elevators.
 ''People like Robin Li of Baidu and Jason Jiang of Focus Media really excite people,'' the professor said. ''Many people think they, too, can create their own companies. The big state-owned banks can have big I.P.O.'s, but no one cares about their stories. It's the entrepreneurs who are really changing China.''
 But investors are hardly ignoring the banks. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which a few years ago was saddled with debt, is now worth about $220 billion, making it the third-most-valuable bank in the world after Citibank and Bank of America.
 On a smaller scale, Tencent, owned by 35-year-old Ma Huateng -- one of China's biggest Internet companies -- is already worth $5.7 billion.
 And then there are the real estate barons, who have often used their political connections to get access to cheap land, only to see land and housing prices soar as the country's increasingly wealthy look to purchase their first homes.
 Now, companies like Hopson, R&F and Agile Property Holdings have in recent years gone public in Hong Kong, and then watched their shares soar 100, 200 and 650 percent since listing.
 Shimao, a developer of luxury properties based in Shanghai, is valued at more than $7 billion.
 The story of Country Garden, which is based in Guangdong Province, near Hong Kong, is much simpler.
 According to analysts and accounts in the Chinese media, Mr. Yang grew up poor in the city of Foshan, worked as a farmer and construction worker and married a bricklayer who was in the same construction crew.
 In the 1990s, he moved into real estate and acquired distressed property or even wastelands at a time when the future of the Chinese real estate market was still uncertain.
 When the government began reforming the market and allowing companies to acquire public land and sell plots to home buyers in the late 1990s, the market began to take off.
 Now, Mr. Yang, who is the company's chairman, is sitting on huge reserves of land and churning out new, modestly priced homes at breakneck speed, analysts say.
 ''I get the land and sell properties at a reasonable price,'' Mr. Yang told investors during the road show before the public offering. ''I move a lot of product.''

HEADLINE: 2008 Democratic Hopefuls Propose a Ceiling on the President's Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
Grappling with one of the biggest domestic policy choices that will confront the next administration, the leading Democratic presidential candidates say they would raise a variety of taxes on affluent people but extend President Bush's tax cuts for middle- and lower-income families.
 Virtually all of Mr. Bush's tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2010, and the issue of whether to extend some or all of them sharply divides the parties and is a complex one for the Democratic candidates on both political and fiscal policy grounds.
Already, Republicans are signaling that they will attack the Democrats for what they say would be a mammoth tax increase that would threaten the economy and fuel growth in government spending. Democrats say the shift they are advocating would bring more fairness to the tax system and help pay for needed expansions of social programs while helping to keep the budget deficit under control. 
 Although they have yet to release detailed proposals or to talk about the issue in any depth on the campaign trail, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, and former Senator John Edwards, said through aides that they were backing variants of the same approach, which would result in higher taxes on income, capital gains and stock dividends for upper-income people. All of them, as well Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Gov. Bill Richardson, have made clear that they would support keeping in place the tax cuts that have benefited the vast majority of people, roughly speaking households with income less than $200,000 or so. In that way, the Democratic stance would ensure that a substantial portion of one of Mr. Bush's signature policies would outlast his presidency, even if his party loses the White House.
 But Democrats have also signaled that they intend to undo a central principle of the Bush tax cuts -- that they should extend to all income levels -- by rolling back reductions that have benefited the wealthiest Americans in recent years.
 ''Yes, we'll have to raise taxes,'' Mr. Edwards declared in February in one of the first statements by a Democratic candidate on the issue.
 Democratic strategists said the candidates were all keenly aware that Republicans are eager to attack them over tax increases. Vice President Dick Cheney accused Congressional Democrats last week of already planning ''the biggest tax increase in American history.''
 ''The result would be a staggering tax increase on the middle class, on families and small businesses, and a return of the federal death tax from zero back up to a confiscatory 55 percent,'' Mr. Cheney said.
 But Democratic campaign officials have not shied away from the conflict, asserting that the Bush tax cuts were tilted in favor the rich and need to be rebalanced.
 ''Americans know there is a difference between keeping taxes as low as possible on the middle class, and giving away the bank to the wealthiest Americans,'' said Bill Burton, a spokesman for Mr. Obama. ''If President Bush's tax cuts are extended, the wealthiest 1 percent will save more than the bottom 80 percent combined, at a cost of $1 trillion over 10 years.''
 The Democratic candidates would be trying to recapture a big chunk of the revenues that were allocated to tax cuts in the Bush years. And they would be challenging one of the main arguments offered by conservatives in favor of tax cuts, that reducing rates on upper-income people spurs more investment and job creation.
 To keep in place the entire package of Bush tax cuts would cost the government about $1.8 trillion over the next decade, according to Congressional budget analysts, a period when the nation will also begin confronting the costs of an aging population to the Medicare and Social Security systems.
 Simply extending Mr. Bush's tax cuts for families that earn less than $200,000, and most of the reduction in estate taxes on inherited wealth, could cost about $900 billion over the next decade, according to new estimates by the Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit research group whose tax estimates are considered reliable by most analysts.
 For people with incomes of more than $200,000 a year, roughly the top 3 percent of earners, the Democratic candidates would essentially revert to the tax regime under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. The top marginal tax rate would return to 39.6 percent, up from 35 percent currently, for people with taxable incomes of more than $336,550. People with incomes between $200,000 and $336,550 would see their top rate climb to 36 percent from 33 percent today.
 Mr. Bush's signature tax cuts for capital gains and stock dividends would all but disappear, because people earning more than $200,000 receive the vast bulk of such earnings.
 None of the Democratic candidates would eliminate the estate tax on inherited wealth, long one of the Republicans' goals. Under law, the estate tax becomes smaller each year until it disappears in 2010, only to bounce back in full when the tax cut expires at the end of that year. 
 Several Democratic candidates said they would let the estate tax dwindle to levels set for 2009. At that point, estates worth less than $3.5 million -- and less than $7 million if owned by a couple -- would be excluded from any tax.
 But the candidates have not said how they would reconcile their goal of leaving a portion of the tax cuts in place with the Democratic Party's professed objective of doing nothing to aggravate the budget deficit. Indeed, the presidential candidates are on a collision course with Congressional Democratic leaders who have adopted rules that require paying for new tax cuts with savings or tax increases elsewhere, a stance that would presumably apply to an extension of the existing tax cuts.
 At the same time, leaving even a portion of the Bush tax cuts in place means that the next president and the next Congress would have less money to allocate to spending programs than they would if they allowed all the tax cuts to expire, leaving them with a choice between further increasing the budget deficit or limiting their plans for addressing health care, education, energy and other needs. 
 Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, said Mr. Bush had left Democrats in a very difficult position.
 ''What strikes me now is the degree to which the fairly fiscally irresponsible policies of the last six years have put Democrats in a box,'' Mr. Greenstein said. ''They've got these large tax cuts in place, they have even larger fiscal problems in the coming decades and they have large unmet needs right now, such as 45 million uninsured people. Addressing all three of those things will be very difficult.''
 Even preserving just the so-called ''middle class'' tax cuts could reduce revenues almost $150 billion a year, a bigger cost to the Treasury than the war in Iraq or marquee Democratic initiatives like expanding health care for low-income children.
 None of the Democratic candidates has laid out a detailed agenda for Mr. Bush's tax cuts, but Mr. Edwards, of North Carolina, has been the most explicit. He has said he would not even wait for the tax cuts to expire and would immediately seek to repeal them for everybody earning more than $200,000. He would use the money for his plan to deliver health care to all Americans.
 Measured as a share of the gross domestic product, which many economists say is the best gauge for measuring the size of tax cuts and increases, a repeal of all Mr. Bush's tax cuts would be smaller than tax increases imposed during World War II, the Korean War and the tax increases signed by Mr. Clinton. 

GRAPHIC: Chart: ''President Bush's Tax Cuts'' Main elements of tax cuts, nearly all of which are set to expire at the end of 2010: Personal income taxes Reduced income tax brackets to - 35 percent from 39.6 percent (In 2006, this included the head of a household earning more than $336,550 in taxable income) - 33 percent from 36 percent ($171,650-$336,550) - 28 percent from 31 percent ($106,000-$171,650) - 25 percent from 28 percent ($41,050-$106,000) Created a 10 percent bracket (up to $10,750) Increased child credit to $1,000 per child Expanded the 15 percent bracket and increased standard deduction for married people filing joint returns. Dividends and capital gains Lowered the top rate to 15 percent on taxes paid by stockholders on corporate dividends and the taxes on capital gains. In 2003, the rate was 38.6 percent for dividends and 20 percent for capital gains. Estate tax on inherited wealth Gradually phased out. In 2003, the first $1 million of an individual's estate was not taxed. The limit was set to rise in stages, reaching $3.5 million in 2009. The tax would be repealed completely in 2010. Where the Candidates Stand What the leading Democratic presidential candidates say about the cuts, according to their campaigns: All of the leading candidates have signaled that they would roll back reductions for the top brackets. John Edwards (N.C.): repeal cuts for households earning more than $200,000
 the only Democrat who has said that he would not wait for the cuts to expire. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.): let cuts expire for households earning more than $200,000. Senator Barack Obama (Ill.): let cuts expire for households earning more than $250,000. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. (Del.): let cuts expire for the top one percent of earners. Senator Christopher J. Dodd (Conn.): ''would redirect tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.'' These cuts would all but disappear, because people earning more than $200,000 receive vast bulk of such earnings. None of the candidates would eliminate the tax. An aide to Mr. Biden said that he would retain it at the 2009 level, while an adviser to Mr. Obama said that he was likely to retain it at the 2009 level. Graph: ''Analyzing The Cost'' How the costs would accumulate under different conditions: Extend all tax cuts and repeal the estate tax Extend cuts for households with income less than $200,000 and extend estate tax repeal Extend cuts for households with income less than $200,000 and retain the estate tax at the 2009 level (Source by Tax Policy Center)

HEADLINE: Repaying Alexander Hamilton

 BODY:
Walk through the historic Great Falls district of Paterson and you will get a feel for what life was like in the early days of industrial America. There's the ''raceway,'' for example, a gradually sloping set of canals on three levels. As the water dropped from one level to another, it turned giant wheels that provided power to the mills. 
 A few of the factories still remain, with their numerous windows that provided essential light during a time when artificial lighting was hard to come by. Some of the space has been converted into artists' housing and office suites, including one for a podiatrist and another for a dentist, and a few light manufacturers are using portions of the buildings. 
There is also the site of the ''bull mill'' where bulls harnessed to a wheel walked in a circle to generate additional power. The mill provides a glimpse into an almost forgotten element of the early industrial city: its quasi-rural atmosphere. Livestock roamed the streets, and farmland was just beyond the downtown area. 
 The district's signature feature is the so-called Great Falls of Paterson, the spectacular 77-foot waterfalls; east of the Mississippi it is second largest in volume to Niagara Falls. If you walk on the pathway to the promontory overlooking the falls, the chasm to the north would make you think you are in rural Maine rather than in one of New Jersey's poorest, most rundown cities. 
 It is this 118-acre historic manufacturing district that a group of Paterson natives and residents, prominent American historians and all 15 New Jersey members of Congress are trying to persuade the federal government to designate as a national park. And for good reason: Alexander Hamilton, a founding father who became the nation's first Treasury secretary, established what Ron Chernow, author of an acclaimed 2004 Hamilton biography, calls the model for America's industrial cities. In Congressional testimony last month, Mr. Chernow lamented how the country does a much better job in telling its political history than ''the no less stirring saga of our economic development.''
 But national park designation for the district is a tough sell, despite Paterson's glorious early history of textile and silk mills, steam engine factories, the Holland Boat submarine and the Colt Gun Mill. The National Park Service says it is already telling the story of industrial America, primarily in Lowell, Mass., where the state's powerful Congressional delegation helped win national park designation even though Lowell lacked Paterson's historical significance. And the Bush administration argues there is not enough money to maintain existing national parks, much less acquire new ones. 
 Certainly money is tight, although Paterson's advocates are asking for a modest initial appropriation of no more than $10 million. But a great nation needs to do more than pay for war and commemorate its battlefields and majestic beauty. It needs also to recognize an area that was truly significant in making the nation the economic and capitalist power that it is today. 
 Paterson's story is more complex than the story of presidents whose grand estates are now national parks. Paterson flourished as an industrial beacon, but it then declined and has long suffered hard times. But peaks and declines are an important part of the country's history, and the story of the manufacturing era of early America, in which men born to no great wealth built major industries, deserves to be told in the city where it started. 
 An additional benefit of designating Paterson as a national park is that it may well help bring the city back to some semblance of its better days. That would be an appropriate way to repay Hamilton for his contribution to America's greatness.

A few years ago, an obesity researcher at the University of Washington named Adam Drewnowski ventured into the supermarket to solve a mystery. He wanted to figure out why it is that the most reliable predictor of obesity in America today is a person's wealth. For most of history, after all, the poor have typically suffered from a shortage of calories, not a surfeit. So how is it that today the people with the least amount of money to spend on food are the ones most likely to be overweight?
Drewnowski gave himself a hypothetical dollar to spend, using it to purchase as many calories as he possibly could. He discovered that he could buy the most calories per dollar in the middle aisles of the supermarket, among the towering canyons of processed food and soft drink. (In the typical American supermarket, the fresh foods -- dairy, meat, fish and produce -- line the perimeter walls, while the imperishable packaged goods dominate the center.) Drewnowski found that a dollar could buy 1,200 calories of cookies or potato chips but only 250 calories of carrots. Looking for something to wash down those chips, he discovered that his dollar bought 875 calories of soda but only 170 calories of orange juice. 
 As a rule, processed foods are more ''energy dense'' than fresh foods: they contain less water and fiber but more added fat and sugar, which makes them both less filling and more fattening. These particular calories also happen to be the least healthful ones in the marketplace, which is why we call the foods that contain them ''junk.'' Drewnowski concluded that the rules of the food game in America are organized in such a way that if you are eating on a budget, the most rational economic strategy is to eat badly -- and get fat.
 This perverse state of affairs is not, as you might think, the inevitable result of the free market. Compared with a bunch of carrots, a package of Twinkies, to take one iconic processed foodlike substance as an example, is a highly complicated, high-tech piece of manufacture, involving no fewer than 39 ingredients, many themselves elaborately manufactured, as well as the packaging and a hefty marketing budget. So how can the supermarket possibly sell a pair of these synthetic cream-filled pseudocakes for less than a bunch of roots?
 For the answer, you need look no farther than the farm bill. This resolutely unglamorous and head-hurtingly complicated piece of legislation, which comes around roughly every five years and is about to do so again, sets the rules for the American food system -- indeed, to a considerable extent, for the world's food system. Among other things, it determines which crops will be subsidized and which will not, and in the case of the carrot and the Twinkie, the farm bill as currently written offers a lot more support to the cake than to the root. Like most processed foods, the Twinkie is basically a clever arrangement of carbohydrates and fats teased out of corn, soybeans and wheat -- three of the five commodity crops that the farm bill supports, to the tune of some $25 billion a year. (Rice and cotton are the others.) For the last several decades -- indeed, for about as long as the American waistline has been ballooning -- U.S. agricultural policy has been designed in such a way as to promote the overproduction of these five commodities, especially corn and soy. 
 That's because the current farm bill helps commodity farmers by cutting them a check based on how many bushels they can grow, rather than, say, by supporting prices and limiting production, as farm bills once did. The result? A food system awash in added sugars (derived from corn) and added fats (derived mainly from soy), as well as dirt-cheap meat and milk (derived from both). By comparison, the farm bill does almost nothing to support farmers growing fresh produce. A result of these policy choices is on stark display in your supermarket, where the real price of fruits and vegetables between 1985 and 2000 increased by nearly 40 percent while the real price of soft drinks (a k a liquid corn) declined by 23 percent. The reason the least healthful calories in the supermarket are the cheapest is that those are the ones the farm bill encourages farmers to grow.
 A public-health researcher from Mars might legitimately wonder why a nation faced with what its surgeon general has called ''an epidemic'' of obesity would at the same time be in the business of subsidizing the production of high-fructose corn syrup. But such is the perversity of the farm bill: the nation's agricultural policies operate at cross-purposes with its public-health objectives. And the subsidies are only part of the problem. The farm bill helps determine what sort of food your children will have for lunch in school tomorrow. The school-lunch program began at a time when the public-health problem of America's children was undernourishment, so feeding surplus agricultural commodities to kids seemed like a win-win strategy. Today the problem is overnutrition, but a school lunch lady trying to prepare healthful fresh food is apt to get dinged by U.S.D.A. inspectors for failing to serve enough calories; if she dishes up a lunch that includes chicken nuggets and Tater Tots, however, the inspector smiles and the reimbursements flow. The farm bill essentially treats our children as a human Disposall for all the unhealthful calories that the farm bill has encouraged American farmers to overproduce. 
 To speak of the farm bill's influence on the American food system does not begin to describe its full impact -- on the environment, on global poverty, even on immigration. By making it possible for American farmers to sell their crops abroad for considerably less than it costs to grow them, the farm bill helps determine the price of corn in Mexico and the price of cotton in Nigeria and therefore whether farmers in those places will survive or be forced off the land, to migrate to the cities -- or to the United States. The flow of immigrants north from Mexico since Nafta is inextricably linked to the flow of American corn in the opposite direction, a flood of subsidized grain that the Mexican government estimates has thrown two million Mexican farmers and other agricultural workers off the land since the mid-90s. (More recently, the ethanol boom has led to a spike in corn prices that has left that country reeling from soaring tortilla prices; linking its corn economy to ours has been an unalloyed disaster for Mexico's eaters as well as its farmers.) You can't fully comprehend the pressures driving immigration without comprehending what U.S. agricultural policy is doing to rural agriculture in Mexico. 
 And though we don't ordinarily think of the farm bill in these terms, few pieces of legislation have as profound an impact on the American landscape and environment. Americans may tell themselves they don't have a national land-use policy, that the market by and large decides what happens on private property in America, but that's not exactly true. The smorgasbord of incentives and disincentives built into the farm bill helps decide what happens on nearly half of the private land in America: whether it will be farmed or left wild, whether it will be managed to maximize productivity (and therefore doused with chemicals) or to promote environmental stewardship. The health of the American soil, the purity of its water, the biodiversity and the very look of its landscape owe in no small part to impenetrable titles, programs and formulae buried deep in the farm bill. 
 Given all this, you would think the farm-bill debate would engage the nation's political passions every five years, but that hasn't been the case. If the quintennial antidrama of the ''farm bill debate'' holds true to form this year, a handful of farm-state legislators will thrash out the mind-numbing details behind closed doors, with virtually nobody else, either in Congress or in the media, paying much attention. Why? Because most of us assume that, true to its name, the farm bill is about ''farming,'' an increasingly quaint activity that involves no one we know and in which few of us think we have a stake. This leaves our own representatives free to ignore the farm bill, to treat it as a parochial piece of legislation affecting a handful of their Midwestern colleagues. Since we aren't paying attention, they pay no political price for trading, or even selling, their farm-bill votes. The fact that the bill is deeply encrusted with incomprehensible jargon and prehensile programs dating back to the 1930s makes it almost impossible for the average legislator to understand the bill should he or she try to, much less the average citizen. It's doubtful this is an accident. 
 But there are signs this year will be different. The public-health community has come to recognize it can't hope to address obesity and diabetes without addressing the farm bill. The environmental community recognizes that as long as we have a farm bill that promotes chemical and feedlot agriculture, clean water will remain a pipe dream. The development community has woken up to the fact that global poverty can't be fought without confronting the ways the farm bill depresses world crop prices. They got a boost from a 2004 ruling by the World Trade Organization that U.S. cotton subsidies are illegal; most observers think that challenges to similar subsidies for corn, soy, wheat or rice would also prevail.
 And then there are the eaters, people like you and me, increasingly concerned, if not restive, about the quality of the food on offer in America. A grass-roots social movement is gathering around food issues today, and while it is still somewhat inchoate, the manifestations are everywhere: in local efforts to get vending machines out of the schools and to improve school lunch; in local campaigns to fight feedlots and to force food companies to better the lives of animals in agriculture; in the spectacular growth of the market for organic food and the revival of local food systems. In great and growing numbers, people are voting with their forks for a different sort of food system. But as powerful as the food consumer is -- it was that consumer, after all, who built a $15 billion organic-food industry and more than doubled the number of farmer's markets in the last few years -- voting with our forks can advance reform only so far. It can't, for example, change the fact that the system is rigged to make the most unhealthful calories in the marketplace the only ones the poor can afford. To change that, people will have to vote with their votes as well -- which is to say, they will have to wade into the muddy political waters of agricultural policy. 
 Doing so starts with the recognition that the ''farm bill'' is a misnomer; in truth, it is a food bill and so needs to be rewritten with the interests of eaters placed first. Yes, there are eaters who think it in their interest that food just be as cheap as possible, no matter how poor the quality. But there are many more who recognize the real cost of artificially cheap food -- to their health, to the land, to the animals, to the public purse. At a minimum, these eaters want a bill that aligns agricultural policy with our public-health and environmental values, one with incentives to produce food cleanly, sustainably and humanely. Eaters want a bill that makes the most healthful calories in the supermarket competitive with the least healthful ones. Eaters want a bill that feeds schoolchildren fresh food from local farms rather than processed surplus commodities from far away. Enlightened eaters also recognize their dependence on farmers, which is why they would support a bill that guarantees the people who raise our food not subsidies but fair prices. Why? Because they prefer to live in a country that can still produce its own food and doesn't hurt the world's farmers by dumping its surplus crops on their markets. 
 The devil is in the details, no doubt. Simply eliminating support for farmers won't solve these problems; overproduction has afflicted agriculture since long before modern subsidies. It will take some imaginative policy making to figure out how to encourage farmers to focus on taking care of the land rather than all-out production, on growing real food for eaters rather than industrial raw materials for food processors and on rebuilding local food economies, which the current farm bill hobbles. But the guiding principle behind an eater's farm bill could not be more straightforward: it's one that changes the rules of the game so as to promote the quality of our food (and farming) over and above its quantity. 
 Such changes are radical only by the standards of past farm bills, which have faithfully reflected the priorities of the agribusiness interests that wrote them. One of these years, the eaters of America are going to demand a place at the table, and we will have the political debate over food policy we need and deserve. This could prove to be that year: the year when the farm bill became a food bill, and the eaters at last had their say.

HEADLINE: Fear of Foreclosure

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
WHEN Matilde Amico's employer cut back her overtime in September, her working hours as a dispatcher for an alarm company fell from a high of 70 hours a week to about 40. 
 By November she had missed two mortgage payments on the three-bedroom ranch in Mastic that she had bought as a single mother in 1989, and had kept by working either two jobs or long overtime hours. She received a notice from her lender threatening foreclosure.
''At that point, I didn't know what I was going to do,'' Ms. Amico said recently. She lives in the house with her 24-year-old son, whose own small business recently failed. ''I could see the sheriff coming and putting all of my things on the street.''
 Ms. Amico told her story at a news conference held on April 12 by Suffolk County officials to announce that there is help available for homeowners facing foreclosure. 
 The county at first said the number of foreclosures on Long Island in 2007 was expected to total 18,854, citing data received from the office of Senator Charles E. Schumer. But the senator's office later said that the county had misinterpreted the figures and that the 18,000 represented mortgages whose interest rates are likely to rise substantially this year.
 It is a big step from rising mortgages rates to foreclosure, however. In all of 2006, 192 homes were lost through foreclosure on Long Island, according to RealtyTrac Inc., a firm that tracks foreclosures nationwide. (Other homes, of course, may have been sold to head off legal action.) 
 Foreclosure actions are often a result of illness or loss of income, as in Ms. Amico's case. But many also result from risky loans given to home buyers during the recent real estate boom, officials say.
 Higher payments have come due on large numbers of subprime mortgages, putting more borrowers in difficulty. Such mortgages -- which often start with low ''teaser'' rates and then spike up to higher levels after a few years -- are usually made to borrowers who have poor credit backgrounds or whose income may not be high enough to comfortably afford larger monthly payments. 
 As Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, said at the meeting, ''Now we're starting to see that these folks are starting to fall behind on mortgage payments.''
 One recourse, a service set up by the county, refers those facing foreclosure to counselors certified by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 The counselors can help homeowners take one of several possible paths, depending on the severity of their financial plight: renegotiate monthly mortgage payments; provide bridge loans that don't have to be paid back until the house is sold or refinanced; refinance the mortgage to a lower interest rate; or sell the house and find other living arrangements. Nassau announced a similar program the same day. In Suffolk, the telephone number is (631) 853-4800; in Nassau, (516) 571-4663. The counseling and assistance are free.
 In the three days after the announcement, Suffolk received nearly 300 calls from homeowners. Nassau reported 260 calls.
 The county can also provide limited financial assistance, up to $1,000 per homeowner, from a federally financed homeless prevention program. ''This isn't throwing good money after bad,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Foreclosed homes become eyesores in the community; they devalue other homes nearby.''
 A day before the Suffolk press conference, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress proposed in a report released in Washington that the government provide funds ($3,300 per household) to help prevent foreclosures nationwide.
 In the report, Nassau and Suffolk Counties ranked 37th among the 50 metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rates in 2006. (Detroit-Livonia-Dearborn, Mich., was first.)
 Across New York, 13 percent of subprime loans were 60 or more days delinquent as of the end of February, up seven percentage points since February 2005, with the highest increases in Long Island, Dutchess County and New York City, according to the report.
 While Ms. Amico had a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage, her situation illustrated how quickly even a solid homeowner can fall into dire straits. In her case, help came by way of a friend who referred her to the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit organization that provides free counseling and garners public funds to help build affordable housing. 
 Kisha Wright, a counselor at the partnership, called the lender who held Ms. Amico's mortgage and tried to restructure the loan. When the bank turned Ms. Amico down, the partnership lent her $13,500 in New York State grant money. Together with $4,000 that Ms. Amico had saved, the amount covered seven missed mortgage payments. Meanwhile, Ms. Amico was able to restore her overtime hours.
 Ms. Wright said that 59 homeowners facing foreclosure had come to the partnership for help in the last three months. In previous years, there would typically have been ''only a handful'' of such cases in the same period.
 By the time Ms. Wright sees them, homeowners have typically missed 3 to 12 months of payments. 
 The situation is likely to worsen on Long Island and elsewhere in the country, local and United States government officials say.
 ''Subprime loan foreclosures are expected to increase in 2007 and 2008 as 1.8 million hybrid ARMs -- many of which were sold to borrowers who cannot afford them -- reset in a weakening housing market environment,'' the Congressional report read. (Hybrid adjustable rate mortgages have rates that climb, but only after an initial rate that can be locked in for, say, 3, 5, 7 or 10 years.)
 Borrowers with interest-only mortgages may eventually be saddled with an additional payment against the principal amount of the loan. That could as much as double monthly payments, according to Pearl Kamer, chief economist of the Long Island Association.
 With a glut of homes on the market, she added, prices are declining, particularly for homes listed for more than $500,000. And lenders have tightened requirements for borrowers, fewer of whom can thus qualify for mortgages.
 She said she believed all neighborhoods on Long Island would be affected, not only the less affluent ones. When real estate was booming, less affluent buyers ''got into these more expensive homes with subprime mortgages,'' Ms. Kamer said, often to move to a better school district.
 As home prices drop, she said, many homeowners are stuck owing more money than they can recover by selling the house, which could lead to foreclosure if they are unable to keep up with the monthly payments.
 Ms. Amico of Mastic said she was initially embarrassed to face Ms. Wright, the counselor who helped her. ''I thought, what was this woman going to think of me?'' she said.
 But she later told her story publicly in the hope that others would swallow their pride and seek help. ''She really helped me save my house,'' Ms. Amico said of Ms. Wright. ''She was with me from Step 1 all the way to the end.''

HEADLINE: The Russell Simmons Guide to Success Through Spirituality

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
RUSSELL SIMMONS, is a hip-hop mogul who personifies what he calls the ''Nu American Dream.'' After a misspent youth that included a stint dealing marijuana, he went on to make his fortune producing hit records, music videos, television shows, movies and clothes. He owns mansions, fancy cars and all sorts of expensive toys. 
 But he says he isn't blinded by the ''bling bling.'' And, as he puts it, he still likes to ''chop it up'' with people in both Harlem and the Hamptons. 
 Mr. Simmons's new book, ''Do You! 12 Laws to Access the Power in You to Achieve Happiness and Success'' (Gotham Books, 320 pages, $25) is an obviously heartfelt, if often rather awkward, effort to share what he has learned so that other people can uplift themselves as he has done. 
 In the book, whose co-author is his longtime speech writer Chris Morrow, Mr. Simmons urges people in the hip-hop world to improve their financial literacy. But he does not offer specific investment advice or a point-by-point program for amassing wealth. And he provides only the sketchiest biographical details of how, from a middle-class upbringing in Queens, he came to create and rule over a multimillion-dollar multimedia empire. 
 The message of ''Do You!'' is unabashedly spiritual, which is both its strength and its weakness as a how-to manual for those who aspire to upward economic and social mobility. Mr. Simmons, 49, says he is a strict vegetarian and an avid practitioner of yoga who believes that material rewards come from living in accordance with an ecumenical notion of ''God's law'' common to Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Buddhism.
 ''The most fundamental law is a belief in the oneness of humanity,'' Mr. Simmons declares. ''Forget millionaires. If I know 15 billionaires, then I know 13 unhappy people. These people's lives might be filled with mansions and yachts and private jets, but their medicine cabinets are also filled with antidepressants.''
 Mr. Simmons has an eclectic roster of friends and philosophical role models. They range from hip-hop stars like Jay-Z, Sean Combs (now known as Diddy), and LL Cool J to Bob Marley, Vince Lombardi, Mahatma Gandhi, E.E. Cummings, Paramahansa Yogananda, Ike Turner, Louis Farrakhan, Eckhart Tolle, Ronald O. Perelman, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, who wrote the foreword to the book.
 Mr. Simmons discusses the boom of hip-hop culture as a case study in the potential payoff of his spiritually centered approach. In the early 1990s, hip-hop appeared to be just another fad. He says that it is now embraced by over 45 million people who spend more than $12 billion a year with a collective voice ''that makes the choices and sets the trends globally.''
 ''Hip-hop is much more specific and sophisticated than youth cultures that came before it,'' he says. ''Much of that is due to hip-hop's visual power, being the first cultural phenomenon born in the video age.''
 The most compelling of his 12 laws is the titular dictum ''Always do you.'' 
 By that he means ''staying true to who you are and what you like instead of following trends.'' He states several corollaries that are even more succinct and resonant. They include ''Lasting success is rooted in honesty'' and ''Authenticity sells.''
 Lest anyone doubt the dual financial and social benefits of outspoken authenticity, Mr. Simmons cites the marketing campaign several years ago for his line of Phat Farm Classic sneakers, which featured billboards demanding economic justice and reparations for slavery, issues that most ad agencies wouldn't touch. ''Most kids couldn't even spell 'reparations' before the campaign, but now they're much more aware of the issue,'' he says. ''It's just part of the way we do business, as well as the way we live.'' 
 By contrast, Mr. Simmons points to the ephemeral career of the white rapper Vanilla Ice: ''His mistake was saying he was from the 'hood when he really wasn't.'' What Vanilla Ice should have said was: '' 'I'm a white kid from the suburbs. I honestly love rap. I'm a good rapper and I made the best record I could.' If he had had the courage to Do Him, instead of trying to be someone else, his career would still be going strong today.''
 Unfortunately, most of ''Do You!'' consists of hackneyed material you could just as well do without. With the exception of the moderately defiant ''Spit truth to power,'' the other 11 laws are familiar bromides that read like page filler churned up by Madison Avenue book packagers. They include: ''Have a vision and stick with it,'' ''Never give less than your best,'' ''Surround yourself with the right people,'' ''There are no failures, only quitters'' and ''Successful people stay open to change.''
 Equally off-putting, if no less well-intentioned, are Mr. Simmons's lengthy digressions on vegetarianism and yoga. It may be true that poor people suffer dire health consequences from eating too much fast food, and it is almost inarguable that meditation can help reduce stress. But we've heard all of that many times before in more instructive detail from much better-qualified writers.
 EVEN so, I don't want to undermine Mr. Simmons by closing on a negative note. To his credit, he uses his hard-earned authority to tell slackers and whiners within and without the hip-hop world how to keep it real.
 ''Please don't tell me you quit your job, or you can't get ahead at your job, because of a glass ceiling,'' he writes, adding after an unprintable exclamation: ''If you think there's a glass ceiling holding you back, then you're a slave.'' Then he urges: ''Shatter that glass, brush off the shards and get on with your vision.''
 That's what ''Do You!'' is all about.

 BODY:
 THE MARKET The News -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at record highs for three consecutive sessions, topping out at 12,961.98 on Friday following encouraging earnings reports. Behind the News -- The rise of the Dow came just two months after its biggest fall in percentage terms since March 2003, when it closed down 416.02 points, or 3.29 percent on Feb. 27. That drop followed a global wave of selling set off by a plunge in China's stock market. This time, the American market appeared to shrug off news that China may raise interest rates to cool down its economy, which grew 11.1 percent in the first quarter. 
The broader market struggled on the first two record days, with losing stocks outnumbering advancers, but by Friday, winners far outpaced losers. THE DIAMOND The News -- Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees' third baseman, set an American League record by hitting 12 home runs in the first 15 games of the season. Behind the News -- As baseball's highest-paid player ($252 million over 10 years) he was leading the American and National Leagues not only in home runs as of Friday night, but in runs batted in, with 30, and was batting ..371. He has come through dramatically in the clutch, as well, twice hitting game-winning home runs to center field with two outs in the ninth inning.Though the season is in its infancy, there is already concern in the Yankee organization that Rodriquez might opt out of his contract at the end of the season and become a free agent. How to describe his performance so far? ''Scary,'' said his manager, Joe Torre. THE POUND The News -- The British pound rose above $2, its highest level against the dollar since 1981. Behind the News -- This may not be the summer for Americans to hop across the pond for a visit. But for the British, it's another story. Travel agents in Britain have reported a 30 percent increase in bookings for American vacations in recent weeks as the pound edged upward, according to The Times of London. Europeans may be joining them, as the dollar has also been declining against the euro. The pound's rise came after a surge in British inflation led to expectations that the Bank of England would raise interest rates, increasing demand for the pound as investors look for bigger returns there. Some analysts expect the pound to remain above $2 for a while. THE INVESTOR The News -- Mutual funds distributed a record $418.5 billion to investors in 2006, surpassing the previous high set in 2000 by nearly $42 billion, according to estimates by Lipper, a fund research company. Behind the News -- It was also a good year for Uncle Sam. Those investors paid at least $23.8 billion in taxes on their capital gains, dividend and interest income, according to Lipper. Still, the tax bite was $7.5 billion less than in 2000, because of reductions in the tax rates. But Lipper warned that ''the tax holiday of sorts is over'' because mutual funds can no longer carry forward losses from the bear market of 2000 to 2002 to offset future gains. Over all, investors in mutual funds experienced what Lipper called ''another banner year'' with stock funds returning an average 14.78 percent. THE HAIRCUT The News -- John Edwards, one of the Democratic presidential candidates, spent $400 for a haircut in Los Angeles, his campaign said. Behind the News -- Actually, it was $800, for two haircuts in recent months, both by the Beverly Hills hairstylist Joseph Torrenueva. He usually charges $175, but upped the fee to $400 because he went to Mr. Edwards rather than seeing him at his salon. The last political haircut to make big headlines was in 1993, when former President Bill Clinton paid $200 for a trim by Christophe, another Beverly Hills stylist, as Air Force One sat at Los Angeles International Airport. Mr. Clinton was skewered then, as Mr. Edwards was last week. ''John Edwards has a new campaign slogan,'' joked Jay Leno. ''Shampoo, rinse, repeat.''

HEADLINE: A Makeover in Progress, and Modern Art, Too

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
WHEN Emma Dewing and her husband, Kanoa Baysa, who had been renting an apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, decided to buy a home last year but realized they couldn't afford the size they needed in New York City, they refocused their search on towns strung along the commuter rail lines running north from Manhattan.
 They felt priced out of Westchester and Putnam Counties, too. So, setting their sights ever northward, Ms. Dewing, a stay-at-home mother, and Mr. Baysa, a sculptor and builder of stage sets, found Beacon, a formerly hard-pressed town 60 miles north of New York City in southern Dutchess County, on Metro-North Railroad's Hudson line south of Poughkeepsie.
There, the ruins of hat-making, brick and carton factories are being reincarnated as artists' lofts; once-boarded-up storefronts have reopened as trendy boutiques; and an abandoned industrial building reopened four years ago as a shrine to modern art, Dia:Beacon. 
 The town, with 14,000 people on 4.8 square miles, still bears the scars of a prolonged economic downturn that started in the mid-1950s. There were periods several years ago, said Sgt. Gary Fredericks of the Beacon police force, when drug traffic thrived along the milelong stretch of Main Street. 
 Today, the storefronts there give more encouraging signs of life. And within walking distance of them -- tucked between the 1,500-foot-high Mount Beacon and the corrugated eastern shore of the Hudson River -- is a housing stock of single-family bungalows, Cape Cods, modest colonials and ranches on tidy lots. 
 Beacon seemed made to order for Mr. Baysa and Ms. Dewing, who several months ago paid $245,000 for a 1920s three-bedroom Arts and Crafts-style bungalow with a fenced-in backyard ideal for their son, Ikaika Baysa, who is 17 months old. 
 They aren't the only ones. Beacon, known among other things for being the longtime home of the folk singer Pete Seeger, is a quirky town that lures creative types -- many on limited budgets -- who shy away from more conventional suburbs. 
 The population reflects a mix of income levels, races and ages. According to Census Bureau figures from 2005, nearly 61 percent of Beacon residents are white non-Hispanic; almost 20 percent are black; and just under 17 percent are Hispanic. 
 Jim Svetz, the co-owner of a Main Street coffee shop called the Muddy Cup, said that on a typical Sunday afternoon a wide variety of residents -- everyone from local teenagers to newly arrived young married couples to old-time parishioners from the Star of Bethlehem Baptist Church down the street -- make themselves comfortable in his shop.
 The town has been growing, but the growth has been spasmodic. In addition to the 300,000-square-foot Nabisco carton manufacturing factory that became Dia:Beacon, there may also ultimately be a waterfront conference center and park called Long Dock Beacon. Ned Foss, one of the developers, estimated the cost of the project at $75 million and said it would include a 166-room hotel, among other things. He said the project was still in the design phase. 
 But another project, the Beacon Cultural Foundation, which made it to fruition in 2003, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year, perhaps sounding a note of caution for entrepreneurs like Mr. Foss. Looking back on the episode, Sam Yanes, the group's director, has said that the $4.25 million it paid for its site, the former Beacon High School, was too high. In the end, he added, the foundation was unable to meet energy costs.
 The school district has since repossessed the building but has not yet decided what to do with it, said Ann Marie Quartironi, a business administrator for the district, adding that artists are still working in the spaces that the cultural foundation created in former classrooms.
 The economic uncertainty is a concern for people like Charlotte Guernsey, an artist and real estate broker who owns land and several buildings in the city. She feels that development isn't happening fast enough. In addition to the failed cultural foundation, Ms. Guernsey points to what she considers an eyesore on Main Street, opposite her office: an abandoned factory with punched-out windows. 
 Its owner, a holding company called Beacon Terminal Associates, has a number of similar old factory buildings. David Lloyds, the company's vice president, said it was working with the state Department of Environmental Conservation to determine the extent of contamination on the properties, with the goal of redeveloping them as residences.
 He would not say what kind of contamination might be present on the properties, although the early-20th-century hat-making industry was known for its use of mercury to shape the felt used in hats. ''It's a long process to redevelop a site, especially old industrial sites,'' he said. What You'll Find 
 Beacon's boosters, like Mayor Cara-Lou Gould, note that economic ups and downs are no indication of failure and aren't imperiling a slow but steady improvement. In the first half of the 1900s, when factories were booming, she claimed, Beacon was among the country's most vigorous small cities.
 She is quick to emphasize the unspoiled atmosphere, pointing out that unlike other similar places, Beacon has not been overrun with Mercedes sedans, McMansions and other symbols of suburban affluence.
 In fact, there are residents who feel that such symbols are already too plentiful. Karen Gowan, a grants analyst for the Ford Foundation in Manhattan who moved here nine years ago, said that in some ways it was already overcrowded. 
 Ms. Gowan, 47, who owns a small gatehouse and commutes to Grand Central Terminal, says that on weekday mornings, parking is hard to find at the Beacon station. 
 ''And for my taste,'' she added, ''there are more McMansions going up than I'd like to see. They're cropping up and spoiling what was the more modest appeal of Beacon when I first moved here.''
 But that appeal is still very much in evidence downtown along Main Street, where rental apartments with tie-back curtains and plants in their windows sit atop storefronts. On the blocks bordering the long commercial strip, the streets are lined with close-set single-family and multifamily wood-frame and vinyl-clad homes built during the last century.
 Farther out, toward Mount Beacon, landowners have bought large areas, carved out new roads in the hills, renovated and rented out older buildings, and built new structures. On one hilly road overlooking the river, grand Victorians once occupied by factory owners and managers are still very much lived in. What You'll Pay 
 The 2000 census found 5,406 rental and ownership units in Beacon, and a density of 2,892 people per square mile. The same census found a density of 5,416 in White Plains, Westchester's county seat. 
 On the east end of Main Street, an industrial building has been turned into 14 rental apartments, with studios for $1,250 a month and two-bedrooms for $1,650 and up.
 The units appeal to tenants like Arben Gasi, 27, and Olivier Lagarde, 34, engineers who work for I.B.M. in nearby Fishkill and find the building reminiscent of city residences in the southern French city of Toulouse, where they used to live. 
 But most apartments in older buildings cost several hundred dollars a month less, said Janet Gerlach of Hedgestone Realty Group.
 Through the first quarter of this year, there were 59 houses listed for sale and 28 sold, said Santo Tambone of the Mid Hudson Multiple Listing Service. By comparison, in all of 2002, 82 homes sold, he said. 
 A two-bedroom, one-bath colonial is listed for $229,900; a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath Dutch colonial for $469,900; and a four-bedroom colonial with five full and two half baths for $1.199 million.
 The median sold price for a single-family house as of the end of April was $272,000, according to Mr. Tambone. For the whole of last year, the median was $300,000. And five years ago, it was $177,500. What to Do 
 For Ms. Dewing and Mr. Baysa, Beacon's major draw is its cultural offerings, not least Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries (named in honor of Louise and Leonard Riggio, donors of $30 million). There is also the Tallix Art Foundry, a sculpture facility that has produced the Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Korean War Memorials, among other works.
 The Howland Cultural Center in the city, in a Victorian building on the National Register of Historic Places, is used for concerts, recitals, plays and poetry readings. Also, Main Street has private galleries, including bau, an artists' collective, and Hudson Beach Glass, which demonstrates glassblowing.
 For residents like Patty Scecina, who moved to Beacon last fall and teaches fifth grade in Garrison, the outdoor activities -- hiking on Mount Beacon and boating on the waterfront -- are also a plus. In the evening, the restaurants and pubs offer live music. Ms. Scecina's two grown sons are among the performers. ''Beacon's small-city atmosphere is an especially good place for an older single like myself,'' she said. The Schools 
 The Beacon City School District has almost 3,200 students in three elementary schools, one middle school and a high school.
 SAT averages from last spring were 478 on the verbal portion and 506 on the math section, versus state averages of 493 and 510. Of last year's 258 graduates, 103 are attending four-year colleges and universities, 129 are at two-year colleges, 5 joined the military and 21 have other jobs, said Edward Mancari, principal of Beacon High School. The Commute 
 For daily commuters to Grand Central Terminal, express trains from Beacon to Midtown Manhattan keep the ride under an hour and 20 minutes. A monthly ticket, if bought on the Web, is $314.58. Round-trip tickets during peak hours are $28.98. The History 
 Beacon was settled in 1709 as the villages of Matteawan and Fishkill Landing. The town was named for the signal fires set on Mount Beacon during the Revolution. 
 During the 1800s, Beacon was a hat-making center. Going Forward 
 Because it is evolving out of a slump, Beacon has real estate bargains. But for the same reason, such investments are uncertain. Also, movies and discount shopping are 20 minutes away in Poughkeepsie.

HEADLINE: To Find the Danger, This Software Poses as the Bad Guys

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FITZGERALD. 
Michael Fitzgerald is a Boston-area writer on business, technology and culture. E-mail: mfitz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FOR all our dependence on computer software, the truth is, it isn't very safe. Recent data breaches involving tens of millions of confidential company files have made this all too clear. 
 Why is software potentially so dangerous to the health of a business? There are scores of reasons. The big one is that software systems are so complex that it is next to impossible to find all the holes.
That can lead to trouble: hackers stealing trade secrets, for example, or customer information. Company servers can also be infiltrated and used to send spam, or data can inadvertently be exposed to anyone with access to a search engine.
 The rise of the Web, which encourages companies to connect their programs to those of other companies, creates the potential for even more software problems -- most code wasn't written with sharing in mind. 
 Then there is the growing practice of releasing unfinished ''beta'' code to the Web to keep ahead of competitors, which can make it seem as if the software industry prefers to fix products after the fact. Indeed, at times, the software industry appears to be racing downhill while still trying to build its car.
 A new company, Veracode, of Burlington, Mass., gives companies a way to help keep the wheels on. In February, Veracode introduced SecurityReview, a service that lets companies automatically test their code, either alone or with other businesses. The goal is to find vulnerabilities that could leave data exposed or that hackers could exploit.
 Some of these vulnerabilities are as old as software itself -- like the buffer overflow, in which hackers hijack computer systems by interrupting program commands and inserting new ones. Veracode's tool finds these and other common problems with software by acting as an automatic hacker.
 Little wonder, since the company's founders, Chris Wysopal and Christien Rioux, were members of the L0pht, a security research group. The L0pht spent much of its time looking for security weaknesses in software, and its members were often criticized as finding problems but not solutions, Mr. Wysopal says. In part to address this, the L0pht evolved into a part of the security consulting firm @Stake (later bought by Symantec).
 Much of Veracode's software was written by Mr. Rioux, a prolific programmer who says he writes code to relax. (While working on SecurityReview, he wrote a version of the computer game Quake 3: Arena that would run on hand-held computers using Microsoft's Windows Mobile operating system -- no easy feat, since the chips in such hand-helds don't include the operations typically needed to run high-level computer graphics.)
 Mr. Rioux's automatic hacking tool grew out of more than a decade of finding software vulnerabilities, and noticing that programmers make the same mistakes over and over again, he says. That led Veracode to develop a patented technique for dealing with these predictable problems. Companies pay for the service by megabytes of code tested, which Veracode says will make it economical for companies to use.
 Tools like Veracode's are useful because companies would otherwise have to hire security consultants to hack into their systems, a process called penetration testing. This is expensive and limited in its impact -- most companies can afford to hire such consultants only for a week or two, and the next time a business updates its software, it needs another test.
 The company has already signed its first customers, says Matt Moynahan, Veracode's chief executive. He says they're attracted to the service partly because it includes a security rating system to assess the risks that software presents to operations.
 Veracode isn't the first company to try to automate elements of hacking. Companies like Fortify, Coverity and Watchfire offer automated tools to help companies test aspects of their software, as does Microsoft. But Veracode is the first to offer a service that tests binary code, produced after a program's source code has been put through a compiler and converted into the 0's and 1's needed to make it work.
 Joseph Feiman, an analyst at the Gartner Group, the market research firm, says a service to test binary code is a breakthrough because the Web 2.0 phenomenon is built on the idea of companies sharing their applications with partners, suppliers and customers, adding new security risks with every connection.
 Veracode lets companies test much of that code, though it cannot test scripting tools, particularly important in Web development. It also needs humans to check on false positives and negatives. ''We can't say we're selling a silver bullet,'' Mr. Wysopal says.
 Business executives may be forgiven for wondering why they've spent billions of dollars on firewalls, antivirus software and other security tools, only to find that they need to spend more money.
 Simeon Simeonov, a venture capitalist whose firm joined with two others to invest $19 million in Veracode, says that what companies have now is a castle and moat, ''but those aren't going to protect you from the assassin who sneaks in on market day.'' 
 IT is also important to point out that security develops over time. Federal law did not mandate seat belts in cars until 1968, notes Brian Chess, a former hardware engineer who is now the chief scientist at Fortify, which offers a tool to test source code. He says companies like his are a sign that the software industry is maturing.
 Michael Howard, a senior security program manager at Microsoft and the author of six books on software security, says he thinks that software can't be compared to traditional engineering. ''Would a car survive attacks every 15 minutes from anywhere in the world?'' he asked. ''I would say no.''
 Microsoft, which as the world's biggest software company is also the world's biggest hacker target, stepped up efforts five years ago, when Bill Gates, its chairman and then the chief executive, wrote one of his fabled memos demanding that the company improve the security of its products.
 Mr. Howard has been intimately involved in that effort, and says that it is paying off. For instance, the latest version of Microsoft's Internet Information Server has had one-third of the vulnerabilities discovered in its predecessor.
 Microsoft has also developed what it calls the Security Development Lifecycle, which mandates how to create a secure software development culture. Microsoft takes security seriously enough to share these even with rivals like Adobe. Even longtime critics of Microsoft say the company has made progress.
 Mr. Howard says that more improvements will always be needed because data thieves will always find new ways to get into systems (some of which, like sweet-talking employees out of passwords, can foil the best software). It is, he says, part of the cost of doing business in the digital age.

HEADLINE: Slackers, Beware

BYLINE: By Laura Pappano. 
Laura Pappano is author, with Eileen McDonagh, of ''Playing With the Boys: Separate Is Not Equal in Sports,'' to be published in October by Oxford.

 BODY:
YOU'RE not done.
 You may have gotten a thick envelope with a perky congratulatory letter from the college admissions office. You may have told everyone you know (and some you don't) where you're going. You may have your new school hoodie in wardrobe rotation.
You're in, but remember: You're not done.
 After being accepted at Franklin & Marshall College, in Lancaster, Pa., Isa Valera spent last spring doing everything, it seemed, but hitting the books. When she wasn't at her two jobs, she focused on prom, graduation from Frederick Douglass Academy in the Bronx and ''hanging out with friends for the last time.'' Her grades fell from 80s and 90s to ''barely passing.'' 
 Just weeks before classes were to begin, the college got in touch: admissions was rethinking her acceptance. ''I was too ashamed to tell my mother,'' says Ms. Valera. ''While she was running around and getting stuff for my room, I was thinking in my head, 'You might not want to do that.' ''
 Ultimately, Ms. Valera was allowed to enroll -- but only after she had written a contrite letter, completed an essay assigned by the admissions office on how she planned to structure her college life and agreed to meet monthly with the dean of admissions.
 Senioritis has infected the college-bound since, oh, the beginning of time. But with a high-stress admissions process that begins in ninth grade, today's seniors may be more tempted than earlier ones to let up once they get in. 
 If anything, though, colleges are extending the admissions period by making sure students stay on track in that twilight between acceptance and arrival on campus.
 While colleges and universities have always insisted students maintain top grades, more are now poring over midyear and final transcripts, mailing warnings or making phone calls to students with fallen averages. And in some cases, they're rescinding admission. 
 Many took note when the University of Washington revoked acceptances last summer for 23 would-be freshmen with poor final high school grades. The university had just moved to a holistic approach to admissions, thoroughly reviewing applications and final grades, as opposed to relying on an index of grade point average and test scores, as most large public universities do. 
 Officials also mailed out 180 warning letters telling students they were unhappy with their senior-year effort. 
 Philip A. Ballinger, Washington's director of admissions, calls rescinding acceptances ''a matter of fairness.''
 ''If certain students decided they didn't want to be students their senior year, we shouldn't have them here,'' he explains. Mr. Ballinger, like many higher education experts, is concerned that the emphasis on college admissions is making 12th grade ''a wasted year.'' He hears complaints from high school counselors that once students are accepted they ''just slack off.'' 
 The University of Colorado at Boulder rescinded admission for 45 students last year, including 10 who had been through freshman orientation, had selected classes and had even met their roommates. ''It is the hardest time of year because it's very emotional for families and the students,'' says Kevin MacLennan, Colorado's admissions director. 
 The message that a college acceptance is conditional -- a point colleges have emphasized to little effect for years -- is finally getting a hearing. For one, colleges want students to stay the course and graduate. ''You want to be sure you are admitting students who will not struggle academically,'' says Susan E. Donovan, dean of admissions at Syracuse University. But they are also applying a more critical eye to final transcripts because waiting lists are bursting. With admissions offices receiving record numbers of applicants, they can insist students stay focused.
 Last June 29, Abby Siegel, then a counselor at Stuyvesant High School, heard from a panicked mother after her son's admission to a liberal arts college on the West Coast was rescinded. His grades had fallen, from the 90s into the 70s. He had blogged about the drop, which alerted the admissions office. (Note to applicants: they do read your blogs.)
 ''The school had overbooked the freshman class,'' says Ms. Siegel, now an independent counselor in Manhattan. ''They turned around and said, 'You are not living up to the standards we expected and you are no longer invited to attend this school.' '' Although she scrambled and found a city university to take the student, it was hardly his top choice. ''This is a bad life lesson to learn,'' she says.
 This year, the University of Michigan received nearly 27,000 applications for September's 5,400 freshman spots, the largest class in its history, says Ted Spencer, associate vice provost and executive director of admissions. Incoming freshmen with poor final grades will receive one of three letters. Last year, 62 whose grades fell from A's to C's got a gentle warning, encouraging them to ''take advantage of the counseling and academic support services offered by the university.'' Another 180 whose final grades were C's, D's and F's were told to explain in writing ''the events that caused the decline in your performance.'' Students had to ''provide supporting documentation from a physician, counselor, principal, teacher or any other person who can support your letter of explanation.'' In a few cases -- nine last year and 11 the previous year -- students received letters rescinding admission and suggesting they ''are not yet ready to undertake the demanding and competitive programs offered here.'' 
 Mr. Spencer acknowledges that seniors may be burned out or overextended with nonacademic activities. Still, he notes, ''we're seeing more students for a variety of reasons not having strong academic endings.''
 Unfortunately for such students, colleges don't receive final transcripts until June or July and may revoke admission as late as July or August -- after students have given up spots at other colleges and have few options. To avoid last-minute surprises, high school counselors advise that accepted students stay in touch about academics. 
 Steven Roy Goodman, a college admissions consultant in Washington, D.C., says that one student he is advising was admitted early to Northwestern, and once accepted, wanted to lighten her workload. After dropping one Advanced Placement course, she told the college of plans to drop English and take photography. It waved a red flag. If she did, the university would reconsider her acceptance. ''She kept the course, which was the right answer,'' he says, noting that the communication avoided a potential problem.
 Some admissions officials will give slackers a second chance. Franklin & Marshall rescinds a few acceptances each year, but Dennis Trotter, vice president for enrollment and dean of admissions, first allows those students at risk to demonstrate academic seriousness by reading a book and writing a 5- to 10-page essay on it. Last summer, some were assigned to read ''Making the Most of College: Students Speak Their Minds,'' by Richard J. Light. The admissions staff reads every essay, he says. ''We are giving you a task to accomplish. If you basically blow it off and say it doesn't matter, it's very likely we will send a letter rescinding the offer.''
 The assignment turned out to be a boon for Ms. Valera, who insists the scare of having her admissions rescinded has made her a better student.
 ''I'm definitely not complacent or nonchalant about my grades or how much time I devote to my studies,'' Ms. Valera says, speaking on her cellphone from the lobby of the Shadek-Fackenthal Library, where she was choosing a topic for an economics paper on Sierra Leone. ''I don't want to get another letter saying 'You should go home now.' ''

HEADLINE: Bush Administration Gains Support for New Approach on Global Food Aid

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 19 

 BODY:
Waiters in white aprons maneuvered through a noisy cocktail party here Tuesday evening, offering heaping platters of jumbo shrimp, lamb chops and crab-stuffed mushrooms to a crowd of people in town for an annual food aid conference dedicated to ending world hunger.
 As shipping and agribusiness executives, charitable workers, lobbyists and federal employees mingled at Morton's steakhouse, Charles Worledge, who works for the Long Island-based Sealift Inc., a major shipper of American food to the hungry, offered an insight essential to understanding the politics of food aid.
 ''I thought this was a charity,'' he explained during the party, for which another shipping company played host. ''It's not. It's a business.''
 It was here in Kansas City, at the 2005 food aid conference, that the Bush administration pushed for a fundamental change in food aid that would have diminished profits to domestic agribusiness and shipping companies. It proposed allowing a quarter of the Food for Peace budget to be used to buy food in poor countries near hunger crises, rather than buying only American-grown food that had to be shipped across oceans. 
 And Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns spoke at the conference on Wednesday to again make the administration's case for the same idea, contending that such a policy would speed delivery, improve efficiency and save many lives. 
 Congress in each of the past two years killed the proposal, which was opposed by agribusiness and shipping interests who stood to lose business, even as it won support from liberal Democrats like Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Earl Blumenauer of Oregon -- generally not a subset of lawmakers found in the president's corner.
 But there are signs that the frozen politics of the issue are beginning to thaw, especially as evidence of flaws in the current aid system mounts. 
 A Government Accountability Office report released on the eve of this conference described in stark detail a system rife with inefficiencies: the amount of food shipped over the past five years has fallen by half as shipping and other logistical costs have soared. Only a little more than a third of federal food aid spending actually buys food. The United States feeds about 70 million people a year now instead of the more than 100 million it fed five years ago. 
 And experts worry that the food aid budget will feed even fewer of the world's 850 million hungry people as soaring demand for corn to make ethanol drives up the cost of that staple, a mainstay of food aid programs.
 This year, some farm state lawmakers are for the first time considering backing a pilot program to test buying food overseas. Representative Jo Ann Emerson, a Missouri Republican on the Agricultural Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, opposes major changes in food aid, but, she said, ''doing a small demonstration is fine with me.''
 ''If it turns out to work better in some places than others,'' she said, ''I don't have a big problem with that.''
 And some influential supporters of the administration's more ambitious proposal, contained in the farm bill, are speaking out. Former President Bill Clinton recently said at a fund-raiser for Bread for the World, a Christian group that lobbies on hunger issues, that it was to Mr. Bush's ''everlasting credit'' that he had proposed buying food aid in poor countries. Such a policy had never crossed his mind when he was president, Mr. Clinton said, but he thought it was a great way to help farmers in Africa and buy food more efficiently.
 And while an alliance of 15 nonprofit groups involved in food aid has endorsed only a pilot program for local purchase, Catholic Relief Services, which has a million donors and links with 13,000 parishes, has embraced the administration's proposal. Addressing hundreds of people assembled at the conference, Ken Hackett, president of the agency, which is a major player in food aid, declared, ''C.R.S. supports the administration's request for greater flexibility through local purchase.''
 At perhaps no time since the government's food aid program was created during the Eisenhower administration over a half century ago has there been more ferment about its future among scholars, politicians and advocates for the poor.
 The curious mix of altruistic and self-interested motivations that animate American food aid spring from its origins. Early in the 1950s, the government was the farmer's buyer of last resort when commodity prices fell, and as a result it sat on mountains of grain. Public Law 480 and the Food for Peace program, adopted in 1954, provided a way to dispose of the surplus grain, which was costly to store, and at the same time feed the world's hungry people. The law mandated that food for the program be grown domestically.
 Over the years, the farm programs evolved, and the government shifted to buying virtually all food on the open market, but the requirement that it be grown in the United States never changed. In recent years, the United States has bought more than half the food for its aid programs from just four agribusinesses and their subsidiaries: Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Bunge and Cal Western Packaging, according to the Agriculture Department.
 Some researchers and advocates say it is time to rethink the American approach to fighting world hunger. 
 ''Are we committed to eradicating hunger because it's feasible, not terribly expensive and our moral obligation as the richest society in human history?'' asked Christopher B. Barrett, a Cornell University economist and the co-author of ''Food Aid After Fifty Years.'' ''Or are we just trying to placate a few agribusiness, shipping and NGO constituencies with a handout?'' referring to nongovernmental organizations.
 But some in Congress, as well as lobbyists for interest groups that benefit from food aid, warn that untying aid from requirements that the food be grown in America and mostly shipped on American-flagged vessels would shatter the political coalition that has sustained the program for decades and made the United States the world's largest food aid donor. They also warn that cash sent to poor countries can be misused or stolen, and that a mismanaged program to buy food in poor countries could drive up food prices. 
 Still, even here at the food aid conference organized by the Department of Agriculture and the Agency for International Development, some participants were talking up approaches that would sound heretical to old-line champions of food aid.
 Marv Baldwin, president of the Foods Resource Bank, a Christian nonprofit group dedicated to fighting hunger, described how more than a thousand farmers have turned American-style food aid on its head. 
 They are raising farm animals and growing crops on some 7,000 acres across America. They donate their land, labor and the use of their equipment, and church groups help raise cash for fuel and fertilizer. But instead of shipping the crops and animals to poor lands to feed the hungry, the farmers sell them in the United States. The Foods Resource Bank then spends the money from those sales in developing countries to buy seeds, fertilizer, tools and other goods poor farmers say they need to grow food for their families.
 Vernon Sloan, 81, used to donate and ship corn he grew on his 200- acre farm in Ohio to Haiti, Liberia and Angola to feed the hungry. But after years of working with the Foods Resource Bank, he said in an interview, he concluded that it was more practical to sell the crops here, avoid the huge shipping expense and use the proceeds to help farmers in Africa support themselves. ''It's what's needed there,'' he said, ''rather than what we think they need.''

BYLINE: By Yew Leong Lee. 
Yew Leong Lee is a Singaporean writer and video artist whose work has been shown in China, Singapore, Germany, France and the United States.

 BODY:
In 2005, I took a year off from my graduate studies in the States to teach art at a university in Kunming, in southwestern China. At 28, I looked as young -- and as Chinese -- as the students I was supposed to teach, and although I was raised in Singapore and lived in New York, I grew up in a family that spoke Mandarin and practiced Chinese customs. Any delusions I might have entertained about passing incognito, however, were quickly dispelled. Two weeks into my stay, I was negotiating the price on a camcorder battery when the shopkeeper cut me off with: ''Don't bargain. You're rich.'' My branded clothes and spiked hair gave me away as a first-worlder; my relative affluence was not something I could hide. On the other hand, I doubt he knew I was gay.
I had read that although homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, a strong stigma still prevailed. Four out of five gay men end up marrying women, or so the unofficial statistic went. On my first free Friday night, I hopped into a cab with a few addresses from the Internet: places where gay men might convene. But every establishment I visited was closed, save for a seedy-looking sauna that I did not want to enter. 
 About a month later, taking advantage of a weeklong national holiday, I flew to Shanghai to see my brother, who had a business there. During this visit, I met a young man in a mall. I was riding an escalator down; he was gazing at me from above. He wore a pink sweater, which complemented the rosiness in his cheeks. On each of these, a dimple now appeared. I turned around and rode the escalator back up.
 ''You also know this place?'' he asked.
 ''Sorry?'' 
 He seemed disappointed with my answer. Conversation faltered. After a while, I decided to try my luck. ''Would you like to come to my hotel for a drink?''
 Afterward, riding in the taxi with Yang, he explained: that particular floor in the mall was an unofficial ''rendezvous spot.''
 In my hotel room, Yang, who seemed tense until then, finally relaxed. It turned out that he was a migrant worker from Anhui, a province notorious for its poverty, waiting on tables 28 days a month for less money than it costs to see a Broadway show. I watched him undress from my bed, folding each piece of clothing into a square. ''I'm too skinny, you must think,'' he said. ''Hope you don't mind.'' 
 I was caught off guard. ''You know something?'' I finally recovered enough to say. ''You're cute when you smile.'' Yang blushed. ''Can you turn down the wind?'' he asked. He meant the air-conditioning. ''Sure,'' I said. But no matter what I did with the remote control, the air-conditioner did not respond. Apparently, Yang had never slept in an air-conditioned room before. Later that night, as we dozed off, our bodies intertwined to keep warm.
 When I woke up sometime in the early hours, we had disentangled. At first I did not even remember about Yang, but soon I made out a breathing sound over and above the noisy air-conditioning. In the darkness, his silhouette slowly formed before me. I looked at his face wonderingly. What was it like to be this boy?
 Then a thought crossed my mind. My brother had warned me against petty theft. ''The holiday week is the season for crime,'' he said. A lot of people come to town to get work; if they don't get it, they need money to go back home.
 Was my wallet where I had left it?
 Of course it was. Otherwise Yang wouldn't still be there. I put my arms around him. The air-conditioner blew with a vengeance. I clung to Yang even more, shivering, helpless to stop further thoughts as they came: if this stranger were to get up now and take everything -- my money, my cards, our warmth -- could I blame him? Should I feign sleep and let him?
 In the end, nothing that dramatic happened, but after our night together, everything became imbued with what I now see as a certain fatedness. We left that third-rate hotel in the morning. I took Yang to a breakfast place specializing in bean curd and dough sticks. I asked him what he wanted; then, while he found us a seat, I paid for his meal. After breakfast, because my brother would be arriving soon, I sent him on his way.
 It was here I made the mistake. I hailed a cab and handed Yang money to cover the ride. Because I had already opened the door, he had no choice but to get in. But because the offer was too direct, he would not take the cash from me.
 Even as I waved goodbye, I understood that as soon as I was out of sight, Yang would order the driver to stop the car. He would get out and walk the rest of the way.

HEADLINE: Did Somebody Say Indiana Jones?

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE

 BODY:
A HUSH fell over the standing-room-only crowd at the Explorers Club in Manhattan on Feb. 5. In a room whose dark-paneled walls are hung with flags once planted in the far-flung precincts of Everest and Antarctica, the man at the lectern had just finished talking about his anthropological travels through almost 40 countries, across some 500,000 miles, where he recovered from food poisoning and chigger bites in Peru and swam through shark-infested waters off Easter Island.
 Any questions?
 ''Do you want to have children?'' asked a well-groomed youngish woman, who sat attentively with a few dozen of her peers and a smattering of schoolchildren and older people. 
 Not missing a beat, the lecturer, Josh Bernstein, the star of ''Digging for the Truth'' on the History Channel, flashed his square-toothed snow-white smile and assured the crowd -- which included the most women ever to attend a lecture there, the club's manager said -- that, yes, he would like to be a father someday and, no, he's not dating anyone right now.
 Murmurs of approval and titters of laughter followed, with more questions: Does he intend to settle down?
 ''Someday, yes, absolutely,'' Mr. Bernstein said.
 Later, clutching Mr. Bernstein's book, ''Digging for the Truth'' (Gotham), urban women with thousand-dollar handbags lined up for the autograph of a man who prefers an ice cave to a glassy penthouse. His car is a 1982 Toyota Land Cruiser that runs on vegetable oil. His jeans are made with organic cotton. In one program that tests the authenticity of the Holy Grail, he dons chain mail and jousts in Southern France. In another he chariots in Greece while shooting a bow and arrow.
 ''I feel like I should touch him to see if he's real,'' whispered Rosina Seydel, 40, a tall, youthful and blond real estate agent from Atlanta, who attended a second talk at the Explorers Club on March 28, a ''fireside chat'' for members. 
 Ms. Seydel was there as a guest of Tee Faircloth, an Explorers Club member who is a friend of Mr. Bernstein's and the owner of F. M. Allen, the safari outfitter on Madison Avenue. ''Could he be that good looking and that smart and charming?'' she said, her eyes locked on Mr. Bernstein.
 Yes, dear reader. Or at least his largely female fan base thinks so. 
 Mr. Bernstein, 36, is an anthropologist and Cornell graduate. He is the host of a program that explores mysteries like the lost cities of Atlantis and El Dorado. He travels to location by camel or paraglider or with oxygen tanks and flippers, sometimes braving natural disasters and parasites. 
 Last Monday, during his finale on the History Channel, Mr. Bernstein explored Aztec civilization and human sacrifice.
 He is a member of both the Explorers, whose membership roster included Theodore Roosevelt, and the Royal Geographic Society in London, where Charles Darwin and Ernest Shackleton were members. His official fan club numbers 1,700. 
 For two of its three seasons, ''Digging for the Truth'' was the History Channel's No. 1 series, said Lynn Gardner, the station's publicity director. When his three-year contract was up, he was poached by the Discovery Channel, which has more viewers. His as-yet-unnamed program, to begin in January, will include Mr. Bernstein's usual pursuits of anthropological and archaeological subjects, as well as another of his passions, the environment.
 All in a day's work, with no two days the same, he said.
 ''I'm the luckiest guy in the world, given my work,'' Mr. Bernstein said, as he guided chopsticks into monkfish in oyster sauce and sipped a litchi martini at Chinatown Brasserie, in Lower Manhattan. 
 On the air he says, with a serious look, ''We're digging for the truth, and we're going to extremes to do it.'' But in person, he is self-deprecating, once joking during a lecture that he needed ''three cans of Red Bull to get up the nerve'' to navigate some raging rapids. He can also be poignant. He e-mailed his fans to share his heartbreak at the death of the crocodile hunter Steve Irwin. 
 For his own risks, Mr. Bernstein said, he triple-checks every knot and loop when he paraglides or rappels, adding, ''I'm not cavalier, and I don't have a death wish.''
 He has the manners of an earlier era. When Angela Schuster, the editor of Icon, an architectural preservation magazine published by the World Monuments Fund, introduced herself during cocktail hour at the Explorers, Mr. Bernstein promptly fetched her a drink before ordering one for himself.
 His program, too, has a retro appeal: no shooting, no swearing and no provocative babes, unless you count wall paintings of Nefertiti. Mr. Bernstein said, ''We'd get letters saying, 'This is the only show we watch together as a family.' ''
 That's not the only response to the swashbuckling, cowboy-hatted Mr. Bernstein.
 ''Some women send me nude photos of themselves, yeah, and I don't mind that,'' he said, grinning as he tucked into dim sum. ''I also get the letters, some men write and tell me we'd be the perfect couple, and that's O.K. But I just don't play for that team.''
 Reflecting a couple of days after Mr. Bernstein's talk in March, Ms. Seydel said his looks are a lure.
 ''He looks good, so that gets your interest,'' she said. ''But then you hear what he has to say, and that's what's really interesting.''
 Before all the globetrotting, Mr. Bernstein was rooted on the Upper East Side, where he was raised in a fairly typical upper-middle-class Jewish household. But he long had a passion for nature.
 ''I had a tracking box in my bedroom,'' he said. Huh? ''That's a box of sand that I walked in, pretending I was an animal. That determined how my tracks would look if I turned or walked backward.'' It helped him, he said, to understand the nuances of animal movement.
 For all his rugged handsomeness, Mr. Bernstein is that kind of geek. As a teenager at Horace Mann School, he was a faithful reader of two major newspapers, as well as three or four environmental magazines. He clipped articles on the environment and politics and put them in plastic sleeves before cataloging them by subject in binders.
 As children, he and his twin brother, Andy (who is now a corporate consultant), went to Camp Winaukee in New Hampshire, where Josh mastered bow and arrow and Andy the BB gun. Their parents divorced when the boys were 5. They lived primarily with their mother and visited their father in Bedford, N.Y. But in 1986, weeks before Mr. Bernstein turned 15, his father died of a heart attack. Seemingly overnight, he said, he grew up.
 ''While my classmates were comparing their new BMWs and trying to sneak into the city's coolest bars with their fake IDs, I was coming to terms with life without my father,'' Mr. Bernstein wrote.
 In his later teenage years, Mr. Bernstein, a Clint Eastwood fan, fell in love with the American West. In summers he attended a wilderness ranch in Wyoming and learned desert survival and primitive living in Utah with the Boulder Outdoor Survival School.
 At Cornell, he double-majored in anthropology and psychology and was the president of his fraternity (Pi Kappa Alpha). He spent a year in Jerusalem and considered rabbinical school but said the pull of the outdoor life was stronger.
 He returned instead to the survival school at Boulder, Colo., becoming its marketing director and expanding its staff and programs until a downturn in the economy after Sept. 11 shuttered the place. But as the pitchman for the school, Mr. Bernstein attracted attention. He made a demo tape for a survival show of his own. It caught the eye of Peggy Kim, who was the programming director at the History Channel, and he was hired in 2004.
 Ms. Schuster, the magazine editor who listened to Mr. Bernstein's talk at the Explorers Club, conceded that Mr. Bernstein is ''entertaining and charming,'' but she described the program as light.
 ''I think if you're in the field, a lot of the 'gee whiz' in the show isn't so 'gee whiz,' '' said Ms. Schuster, a former senior editor at Archaeology. ''There's so much cool research out there, but I'm not sure how much of it is getting into the show.''
 The History Channel, which is losing Mr. Bernstein, said his program had dropped to its fourth most watched. ''The numbers aren't where we want them to be right now, and we're going in a whole new direction with the new show,'' said Ms. Gardner, the publicity director. 
 Mr. Bernstein said he is looking for more substance in his new Discovery Channel program and wants to deepen its message by covering ecological issues in a smart and urgent way. 
 ''We create a tremendous amount of waste,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''We're creating a greater environmental debt that we're going to have to pay. And that's not sustainable, and it's highly problematic. I hope that my new show will address those realities.''
 Mr. Bernstein, who keeps an apartment in Manhattan for the few days a year when he is home, left on April 6 for the filming of the first episode of his Discovery Channel series. Under orders from his bosses, he was keeping the first location secret.
 Yes, he does think about settling down sometime, which will influence whether or not he continues to be so far-flung.
 ''When you meet the right person, you make changes,'' he said.
 And the right person is?
 ''I'm attracted to tall blondes,'' he said, laughing. ''It isn't easy to find a tall blond Jewish girl who is interested in the environment.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Josh Bernstein, the star of the television show ''Digging for the Truth,'' referred incorrectly to the Boulder Outdoor Survival School, where he was a student and is chief executive officer. Although a post-9/11 downturn caused layoffs, the school did not close.

HEADLINE: High Hopes for Bridgeport

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
JUST about everybody likes a riddle, so here goes: What city, known in part for spectacular green spaces designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, was named by CNNMoney.com in November as one of the 20 housing markets nationwide that are likely to post the biggest home-price gains by 2011?
 Believe it or not, it's Bridgeport. 
The median home price declined last year in Fairfield, Bridgeport's fashionable neighbor to the west, but prices held steady in the desirable Black Rock section of Bridgeport.
 To be sure, the price levels are much lower in Bridgeport than in Fairfield, but officials say this will help to attract adventurous prospective residents to the city. ''Low prices, high potential, expected returns and high risks,'' summed up John Clapp, a professor at the Center for Real Estate at the University of Connecticut. ''It might be a good bet on average.''
 But the first part of this year has not been good for Bridgeport, Professor Clapp said. Within the city, the overall number of home sales declined 9 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with 2006.
 Commercial development is seen as a way to attract people to Bridgeport. The Ballpark at Harbor Yard, a minor league baseball stadium, and the nearby Arena at Harbor Yard, a sports and entertainment site used by an American Hockey League team, Fairfield University's basketball teams and theater productions, are already drawing crowds to events near the waterfront, which is seen as a great untapped asset. 
 Now, the city is working to secure one last parcel for Steel Point, a planned $1.5 billion six-million-square-foot project on a 52-acre peninsula in the harbor. This is envisioned as including 3,500 luxury residences, a marina, a retail center, entertainment facilities, offices, a hotel and conference center and a public esplanade. The prospective developer is Midtown Equities, a Manhattan-based developer.
 In addition, four development teams have been selected to submit proposals by May 31 for the nearby Pequonnock site. This project would have stores and apartments, including a tower at least 10 stories high. One team includes the former Los Angeles Lakers basketball star Magic Johnson; another includes Roger Staubach, the former quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. 
 The Pequonnock site, owned by the city and the Bridgeport Housing Authority, comprises three parcels. One is a former housing project, another a defunct Underwood typewriter factory and a third an orphaned piece of land now used as overflow parking for the Arena at Harbor Yard. The city has requested that the developers submit ''pedestrian friendly'' designs. 
 As for the existing housing stock, homeowners say the market seems relatively strong. Lynne Interlandi, who has lived in the Black Rock section for 25 years, said she had recently sold her deceased in-laws' condominium in Black Rock in 22 hours. To her surprise, the 25-year-old one-bedroom condo, which has never been updated, had two bids at the asking price, $159,900, which she considered high. 
 ''I think we're up and coming in Bridgeport,'' Mrs. Interlandi said. ''When I first moved in here, Fairfield Avenue was filled with little mom-and-pop stores, video stores, small shops. Now it's restaurants and coffeehouses and some of the best restaurants in the city.'' 
 There are also signs that the city's long-suffering downtown may be improving. Increasing numbers of residents are moving in, many of them as renters. A former Warnaco factory was converted into 120 Manhattan-style loft rentals, which went on the market in 2004.
 Artists, so often the first to recolonize distressed areas, have moved into rentals in the Artspace building, a former Read's department store. ''The artists also bring a heck of a lot of personality to the building,'' said Joseph Celli, an oboist and composer who moved in two years ago.
 Mr. Celli has a development of his own: the Black Rock Arts Center, a third-floor space for art shows and performances. He is backed by a 300-volunteer organization. ''We think the arts center is emblematic of the direction the city needs to be moving in in the future,'' Mr. Celli said. 
 A founding director of the alternative art space Real Art Ways in Hartford, Mr. Celli moved back to Bridgeport to care for his aging parents, and eventually decided to move downtown. 
 Nancy Hadley, the director of the city's Office of Planning and Economic Development, says she believes that, with its visibility as a financial news and advice Web site, CNNMoney.com's inclusion of Bridgeport on a list of cities with housing potential promised to help development efforts. 
 According to her, one key step in Bridgeport's turnaround occurred in 2005, when city officials called on the Urban Land Institute, a Washington-based research organization, to conduct a study outlining solutions to some of the city's problems. 
 ''They ripped us apart and put us back together,'' she said, ''and we've been following that blueprint the past two years. The land is beautiful, the access is wonderful, the beach you can't beat. What we needed to do as a city was become transparent and accountable.''
 Bridgeport has had a recent history of public corruption. Both a former mayor and a state senator are serving prison terms, and the current mayor, John M. Fabrizi, admitted not long ago in a press conference that he had been abusing cocaine and alcohol. 
 Despite his troubles, however, Mr. Fabrizi has been a strong advocate for making the most of the city's proximity to the water and to the wealthiest towns in the state.
 ''We all know Bridgeport is undervalued,'' considering its location, said Gail Robinson, a local realtor who writes a blog about the Black Rock neighborhood, where she lives. 
 ''The risk is, will there be another scandal, more corruption? It always seems when we are going to get on our feet, something else happens. It isn't for people looking for a low-risk investment. But it's not a high-risk investment anymore, either. You're seeing lots of money coming in, and lots of investment taking place.''
 But it is the homeowners like Ms. Interlandi, as they watch new retail shops and restaurants open in their neighborhoods, who are taking the pulse of the city in a more intuitive way. ''It will be awhile, I'm sure,'' Ms. Interlandi said. ''But we have a lot of hope.''

 BODY:
DEEP ECONOMY
 The Wealth of Communities 
 and the Durable Future.
 By Bill McKibben.
 261 pp. Times Books/Henry Holt & Company. $25.
Kurt Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim (in ''Slaughterhouse-Five'') had a famous dream in which the film of time ran backward: bombs re-coalesced, sucking their exploding fire back into dark capsules that flew upward into the planes' bomb bays, while German fighters, as if by magic, closed up the bullet holes they had drilled in the bombers; the bombers flew backward to their bases, and the bombs were returned to America and disassembled and diffused into harmlessness. And Hitler became a baby again. All people became babies, a magic reversion down the ages, back to ''two perfect people named Adam and Eve.'' 
 There is such a thing as metaphysical sentimentality. Bill McKibben works our damaged planet Earth through a dimension of time reversal and what might be called the physics of Christian beatitude: The future shall be made past, and the big shall be made small; the global shall be restored to the local; the harm may be undone, the seas may recede, the temperatures may drop, the hurricanes may abate and humanity may be returned to its happier mind. At least, we should steer ourselves in that direction. The result, according to McKibben, would not be paradise; but it might be workable in the long term. The alternative, he thinks, is not.
 Actually, McKibben's aim in ''Deep Economy'' is relatively modest -- to change minds, to present ''a new mental model of the possible.'' It's a good time to try. Franklin Roosevelt was able to explore new paradigms of government (try something; if that does not work, try something else) because he took office amid the financial wreckage of early 1933. There may be an equivalent opportunity now -- not because the world economy has failed but because its pace of success (China growing at a rate of nearly 10 percent year after year, for example) and headlong consumption of the planet's resources, especially fossil fuels, may be setting the world up for disaster. Economic rationales (more = better) that came in with Adam Smith and are now achieving gaudy fruition in globalized hallucinations like the new Shanghai or the Palm Islands of Dubai seem spiritually threadbare -- spectacularly pointless. And not only pointless but something worse, stupid. The political and environmental crises of the 21st century may so reconfigure the world's outlook -- or make it so uneasy, anyway -- that basic rethinking becomes possible.
 McKibben says in effect, All right, we are two nations: 1) Wal-Mart Nation (gigantic, globalized, unsustainable in the face of climate change and the trashing of nature and the coming exhaustion of the world's fossil fuels), a world predicted half a century ago by Lucille Ball in the chocolate factory, desperately gobbling oversweet glut from the unstoppable assembly line; and 2) Farmers' Market Nation (manageably small, localized, communitarian, neighborly, calibrated to the human scale). 
 McKibben lives and teaches in Vermont, and his vision, for better and for worse, is suffused with a certain Vermontlichkeit. Now and then he has a ghastly idea -- as when, discussing the advantages of public transportation over the (isolating and polluting) private car, he remarks of buses: ''And it wouldn't hurt ... if you could hand the driver one of your CDs and she'd slap it in the sound system. It makes the experience convivial.'' That's McKibben's Frank Capra communitarianism: After all, the folks on the bus in ''It Happened One Night'' had a wonderful time singing ''The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze.'' (2007: Here, driver, I think the other passengers might enjoy one of my classic CDs, ''Reign in Blood,'' by the thrash metal band Slayer.)
 It would be unwise to dismiss McKibben's ideas as pipe dreams or Luddism. He makes his case on anecdotal, environmental, moral and, as it were, aesthetic grounds. An attentive, widely traveled writer and environmentalist, McKibben cites the success of local projects around the world, from a rabbit-raising academy in China to a Guatemalan cooperative that manufacturers farm machinery from old bicycles. He defends his ''economics of neighborliness'' against the charge that it is ''sentimental, nostalgic, some Norman Rockwell old-town-green fantasy.'' In fact, he insists: ''Given the trend lines for phenomena like global warming and oil supply, what's nostalgic and sentimental is to insist that we keep doing what we're doing now simply because it's familiar. The good life of the high-end American suburb is precisely what's doing us in.'' His alternative, an intelligent, socially responsible, nonideological localism -- essentially a readjustment downward of material expectations and therefore of our ''hyperindividualistic'' economic metabolisms -- ''might better provide goods like time and security that we're short of.'' People, he thinks, are ''overliberated. ... We need to once again depend on those around us for something real.'' Ratty and Mole and Badger live like sensible animals; runaway capitalism is Mr. Toad.
 McKibben focuses on questions about the ultimate purposes of economic activity and about how human beings might construct a future. His short-form thesis is: ''A single-minded focus on increasing wealth has driven the planet's ecological systems to the brink of failure, without making us happier.'' He asks: ''How did we screw up?''
 Answer: ''We kept doing something'' -- that is, making more and more money and more and more stuff more and more efficiently -- ''past the point where it worked. Since happiness had increased with income in the past, we assumed it would do so in the future.'' The trick on a global basis, of course, would be to improve the lot of those who have too little while scaling down the overconsumption of those who have too much.
 To attempt to alter the world by increments of local improvisation and conservation is to fight against a mighty tide. The world is flat, all right. It is also a toxic mess. Minds are usually changed on a mass scale only by some dramatic event -- Pearl Harbor, say: Americans, isolationist before Dec. 7, 1941, pitched wholeheartedly into the war thereafter. They mobilized themselves and ultimately won, with the help of a lot of powerful sentimentality. Right now, with the tsunami, Katrina, global melting, the world is cruising along -- somewhere around Munich and Czechoslovakia.

HEADLINE: While Brooklyn Sips

BYLINE: By LIZA FEATHERSTONE

 BODY:
WHEN Kazi Hossain, a real estate broker in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, telephoned a client recently to describe a house for sale, he played up one of the property's most desirable attributes. ''One block from Vox Pop!'' he exclaimed. ''You know Vox Pop?''
 It seems like everyone in that newly gentrifying neighborhood knows Vox Pop, a cafe and bookstore that, by day, draws young families and office job escapees. But perhaps more important than the knitting classes and band performances that establish the business as a kind of community center is its coffee, proudly described on well-placed signs and on the menu as ''fair trade'' brews.
''The fact that the coffee is fair trade is certainly more sustainable for the farmers, and having this coffeehouse also helps sustain our community,'' said Willow Fodor, 29, a customer who said she moved to Ditmas Park because of the cafe. ''I just loved the vibe.'' 
 Fair trade, like more familiar labels such as organic, cruelty-free and sustainable, is another in a series of ethical claims to appear on products -- a kind of hipster seal of approval. The fair trade ethic is spreading eastward from the West Coast, where it has been promoted by well-financed activist campaigns and where progressive politics are more intertwined with youth culture. Scott Codey, a member of the New York City Fair Trade Coalition, said the number of retailers in the city selling fair trade products like coffee, tea, wine and clothing has grown to hundreds, from 25, in the last three years. 
 In general, the fair trade label means that farmers of crops like coffee or cocoa in the third world, or workers who stitch T-shirts in factories abroad, are paid fairly. The label is intended as a guide for socially conscious consumers in rich countries when buying goods that originate primarily in Latin America, Asia and Africa. 
 Amid the wine bars and boutiques that line Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Jonathan Coulton, 36, a musician wearing black rectangular glasses, was hunched over a laptop at Gorilla Coffee, where a blackboard proclaims all its coffees are fair trade. It ''makes you feel like you're doing something good just by drinking a cup,'' he said. 
 It may be trendier to advertise clothing as green, or, in the words of a recent Barney's Co-Op window display, as ''insanely sustainable,'' but fair trade -- and its cousin, ''sweatshop-free'' -- are gaining in popularity. Emily Santamore, a founder and a designer of Moral Fervor -- a line of yoga clothing made from an eco-friendly fabric and, according to its Web site, ''produced sweatshop-free in Portugal'' -- said boutiques regularly ask about the origins of her products. For her customers, she added, fair trade assurances are ''becoming almost necessary.'' 
 TransFair USA, a nonprofit group in Oakland, Calif., that awards a Fair Trade Certified label to farm products, says fair trade coffee is the fastest-growing specialty coffee in the United States. It claims that since 1999, its programs have put $60 million more into the pockets of third-world coffee growers than they would have otherwise earned. Such goods were once stigmatized as uncool: the weird Guatemalan pants worn by a high school art teacher, or the muddy-flavored coffee served at a student-run cafe. But savvy marketing, and better products, have helped the fair trade label shed its frumpy image. American Apparel, the fast-growing chain that pays most of its factory workers above the garment-industry standard, and which runs advertisements featuring skinny hipsters in provocative poses, has increased many customers' awareness of labor issues and raised the design ante for products promoted as socially conscious. 
 Proponents of the fair-trade movement, which began in the 1980s in Europe (and where flowers and even soccer balls are labeled fair trade), say the low prices that most companies pay to producers in economically disadvantaged countries cause widespread misery: poverty, unsafe work conditions and forced child labor.
 TransFair USA, founded by a group of activists in 1998, says it audits American companies that receive its certification to ensure that third world farmers of coffee, cocoa, fruit and other crops receive a ''fair, above-market price.'' The group says the system has improved conditions on farms and that the additional income, subsidized by higher consumer prices, has enabled farmers to send their children to universities and communities to build clinics and schools. 
 Fair trade has a particular appeal to a generation of consumers that came of age during campus labor protests. In 1996, Kathie Lee Gifford was humiliated on national television by the news that children in Honduras were making clothing bearing her name, and, in the ensuing years, student protesters demanded better conditions for workers making clothing with university logos; some streaked through campus because they would ''rather go naked than wear sweatshop clothes.'' 
 After graduating from the New School with a degree in literature in 1993, Sander Hicks, 36, the founder of Vox Pop, worked at a Kinko's, where he and his fellow workers experimented with union organizing and even a worker collective. Now, he's proud of his high-quality coffee, but asserts that the fair trade label gives it an additional ''karmic kick.''
 Not everyone is feeling it. 
 Some industry observers and journalists have identified labor abuses on farms producing crops that have been certified as fair trade by international groups, like paying migrant workers below a country's legal minimum wage. 
 Jean Walsh, a spokeswoman for TransFair, conceded that this was sometimes the case. ''But the fair trade system,'' she said in an e-mail message, ''is the only mechanism that begins to guarantee small-scale farmers the income they need to be able to improve the wages of laborers on their farms.'' 
 (Unlike food, items such as clothing and other non-agricultural goods, when sold in the United States, have no single recognized certification system. Instead, consumers have to trust the wholesalers and retailers.)
 And though many people buy fair trade products in reaction to what Mr. Codey of the New York fair trade coalition calls ''mainstream commercial culture,'' others point out that to make a real impact, fair trade has to become much more widespread, even if that means losing some of its in-group appeal. 
 Larger corporations, including McDonald's, Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, now offer some fair trade coffee, but, ''it's still too limited in the United States, to just a few commodities,'' said Kevin Danaher, a founder of TransFair. 
 ''It's not places like Gorilla that are going to make a difference,'' said Janice Allen, 27, a barista at Gorilla Coffee, with a piercing just over her lip and chipped blue nail polish. ''Maxwell House going fair trade, that would make a difference.''

HEADLINE: Pumping Out the Numbers

DATELINE: HAMDEN 

 BODY:
THE Connecticut State Legislature recently rejected a bill that would in effect force oil companies to charge the same price for their gasoline everywhere in the state, from Greenwich to Putnam. The proponents of the bill, however, have vowed to fight on and make Connecticut the first state to do this. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of confusion about what a uniform statewide gas price would mean. 
 First, some explanation. Oil companies do not set a uniform wholesale price for gasoline across the state. Instead, they decide the price to charge by grouping gas stations into areas, or zones, that have similar markets -- a practice called zone pricing. (The oil companies do not get together to determine the number of zones, location of zones or prices in the zones -- that would be price collusion and it's illegal.) If Connecticut bans zone pricing, each oil company would still decide what price to charge in the state, but local market conditions would become largely irrelevant. 
What does this mean for consumers? It means that wholesale prices would be the same in, say, north-central Connecticut, Litchfield County and Fairfield County, even though they are all very different markets. 
 North-central Connecticut is average for the state in both the income of consumers and the number of gas stations per resident. That is, neither incomes nor gas stations per resident are unusually high or low relative to the rest of state. The typical gas station in this area probably pays a wholesale price for its gasoline that is about average for the state and charges a price at the pump that is also about average. We can think of this station as representing the ''average'' station in Connecticut in the sense that it faces neither extremely high or low demand nor number of competitors.
 Next consider a station in a part of Connecticut like Litchfield County, where either the number of competitors is high so local competition is fierce or demand for gas is relatively low or both. This station charges a lower price than the average station does. In return it will negotiate lower wholesale prices for its gas and other supplies, lower wages for its employees and lower rent for its land. Gas distributors to this station have an interest in seeing it survive. Thus, local market conditions force oil companies to sell gas to this station at a wholesale price lower than what it would typically charge. 
 Now consider the fate of the station in a place like Fairfield County where incomes and demand are high or competition is scarce or both. This station can charge prices at the pump that are above the average. While the station would still like to negotiate low wholesale gas prices, low wages, low costs for other supplies and low rent in order to earn above average profits, no one is willing to play along. 
 These three stations illustrate zone pricing at work. To see that this is good for consumers, consider what would happen if a single wholesale price for gas was instituted. 
 If the state were to force oil companies to charge the lowest wholesale price, distributors would be tempted to restrict supply to Connecticut and focus on more profitable markets. That withdrawal of supply would drive up gasoline prices in the state. 
 What about the highest wholesale price? Well, let's hope that's not what they do. It would clearly raise all pump prices a lot everywhere but is fortunately unlikely to occur. That leaves us with a wholesale price somewhere in the middle. To be precise, let's suppose it's the average wholesale price you'd find in north-central Connecticut. 
 The stations in areas where there is low income but lots of competition like our Litchfield example would see higher wholesale prices under the ban. Those stations, already operating on thin margins, will be forced to raise prices at the pump or go out of business. 
 And what about stations in Fairfield? These stations will find that wholesale prices have fallen, which means their costs are lower. These stations would be stupid to pass on the costs to consumers in the form of lower prices at the pump. Why? Because the pressure to pass on lower costs is minimal. So, prices at the pump for consumers in this area won't fall.
 How do we know this? Using actual Connecticut data for a recent three-year period, we found that prices at the pump would have risen in about 80 percent of the state. They would have remained unchanged in only Fairfield County, where incomes are highest and the number of stations per resident is lowest.
 State legislators should think again about the effects of banning zone pricing. It will harm most, if not all, Connecticut consumers, especially those with the lowest incomes.

HEADLINE: Emerging Markets, Emerging Giants

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
A NEW wave of foreign competitive pressure is beginning to ripple through the United States economy, from companies in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China. These companies are seeking to become world-spanning multinationals -- just as Samsung Electronics emerged from South Korea and Toyota sprang from Japan in earlier phases of globalization. 
 From Brazil, Embraer has become a big supplier of regional jets in the airline industry. Other Brazilian companies, like Braskem, Embraco and Natura, are also expanding in a variety of global markets. Russian companies like Gazprom, Lukoil and Rusal are using Russia's natural resources to leap into the United States and other countries. India is producing powerhouses in technology services like Wipro, Infosys Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services and global competitors in manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. The world's largest steel company is now controlled by Lakshmi N. Mittal, an Indian living in Europe.
China may be the largest single source of new multinationals. Aside from Lenovo, which bought I.B.M.'s personal computer division, Haier is emerging in appliances, Huawei Technologies is competing against Cisco Systems to sell telecommunications equipment around the world and the Pearl River Piano Group is carving out a huge share of the piano market. 
 The emergence of these new multinationals is part of ''the biggest shift in the global economy since the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century,'' says Antoine van Agtmael, author of a new book, ''The Emerging Markets Century: How a New Breed of World-Class Companies Is Overtaking the World.'' ''We are seeing a rebalancing of the global economy back to where it was before the Industrial Revolution, when China and India were major powers in the world.''
 How is it that so many companies that once would have been content to operate in their home markets have so rapidly gained the expertise to manage complex multinational operations? One explanation is the new ease of global communication and air travel. Another is that the necessary expertise is available for sale.
 ''These companies are hiring people from anywhere in the world,'' says Peter J. Williamson, a professor at Insead, the business school, and co-author of ''Dragons at Your Door: How Chinese Cost Innovation Is Disrupting Global Competition.''
 ''They're engaging Ogilvy & Mather to do their advertising. They're using McKinsey for their strategy,'' he says. ''There's been a very big shift in the ability to obtain knowledge that once would have been very slow to build up.''
 Estimates of the number of these new multinationals vary considerably. Mr. van Agtmael's book identifies 25 of them. A study from the Boston Consulting Group last year named 100. Accenture, the consulting firm, says that there were 62 emerging-market multinationals in the Fortune Global 500 in 2005, up from 20 in 1995; it predicts that the number may hit 100 within 10 years.
 Not all the would-be competitors will be successful, of course. Mr. van Agtmael acknowledges that some will have to learn to focus on a few core areas where they truly excel, rather than engaging in a broad mix of activities as they have done at home. Western multinationals also have advantages in distribution, logistics and branding.
 But clearly, enough of these new companies will succeed that Americans will feel it, with both positive and negative results. On the positive side for consumers, most of these companies have low cost structures and will be able to offer their goods and services at lower prices.
 But there will be some pain as well. ''A lot of people who felt that their companies or their jobs were protected because they were in the high-value-added or high-tech kinds of businesses used to think that the rise of these companies was irrelevant to them,'' Professor Williamson said, referring to fields like architecture, design and pharmaceuticals. ''But now they are going to find they are under significant competition from these companies. Their companies are going to face competitors providing pretty much the same level of technology or design competence at a quarter or 20 percent of their price.''
 That means American companies will have to look at their own operations with a ''zero base mentality,'' says William D. Green, chief executive of Accenture. Companies that don't design business models that are competitive with those of the emerging multinationals will simply be blown away, he says.
 THE emerging giants have different strategies, reflecting their strengths, says Harold L. Sirkin, senior vice president of the Boston Consulting Group, based in Chicago, and co-author of its 2006 study. Some, particularly the Chinese companies, have mainly used cheap labor to undercut established companies. The emerging multinationals haven't had time to establish brand names, as Sony or LG have done, but they will compensate for that. ''They are either going to buy American companies and use their brands or develop their own brand names,'' says Mr. Sirkin, who regularly consults in China and India. 
 Others, like Embraer of Brazil have learned to exploit a local base of excellent but low-cost engineering talent. Companies like Johnson Electric, which is based in Hong Kong and has the capacity to produce three million motors a day, have strong positions in a global product niche. And Russian companies have leveraged their natural-resource wealth to set up distribution channels and make acquisitions in the West.
 Mr. Sirkin says that over the long run, the entry of the new multinationals into the United States market will be a ''bigger deal'' than the previous arrival of Japanese or Korean businesses, if only because countries as big as China and India are likely to spawn many important companies. ''We'll see the next Toyota coming from China and the next Samsung coming from India,'' he says.
 The new multinationals represent a far more complex phenomenon than a surge of imported products, which can be blocked or reduced by tariffs and quotas, experts say. These companies will be buying assets, and while political disputes may block some deals, as in the case of a Dubai group aiming to buy American ports or of Haier trying to buy Maytag, there doesn't seem to be any stopping of the broader trend. 
 The emerging multinationals will also be building new plants in the United States and offering services and products that are in great demand, like the I.B.M. personal computers now made and sold by Lenovo.
 But Mr. Sirkin is optimistic that the United States economy will continue to flourish. ''There are a lot of imports coming in from China today, but what's our unemployment rate?'' he said. ''It isn't 43 percent. We've responded.''

HEADLINE: The Calendar Says 'Sell,' but Should You Obey?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AFTER sending the Dow Jones industrial average to new highs last week, shareholders are about to face a seasonal challenge: investing in equities during what has historically been a frustrating six-month stretch for stocks.
 Whether you measure the market's performance going back to the 1980s, the 1950s, or even 1900, the worst time of the year to invest in domestic equities has been the period we're about to enter: May through October.
Since 1945, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained just 1.6 percent, on average, during that stretch. By contrast, the best six months for the S.& P. have been the period that's coming to an end: November through April. Since the end of World War II, the S.& P. 500 has shot up 7.1 percent, on average, during these months. 
 This phenomenon has been just as strong in recent years. Since 1990, stocks have gained 7.8 percent from November to April, on average, but only 2.1 percent from May to October.
 Chris Orndorff, head of equity strategy at Payden & Rygel, an asset manager in Los Angeles, says he doesn't usually pay much attention to seasonal differences. ''But these numbers are quite compelling,'' he said. 
 Why such a disparity in performance? Theories abound. Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor in chief of The Stock Trader's Almanac, says investors may be ''operating on a summer vacation schedule'' during this six-month window. He added that investors usually don't have as much money to put to work in the market in the middle of the year. By the time May rolls around, some people are done funding individual retirement accounts, and many have already spent or invested year-end bonuses.
 That may explain why mutual fund sales tend to slow noticeably during that six-month period. In fact, since 2000, net new inflows into domestic stock funds from November to April have been three times as big as those from May through October, according to data compiled by the Investment Company Institute. 
 To be sure, the 1.6 percent gain for the S.& P. during this stretch is only an average. In a number of midyear stretches, stocks have fared much better. 
 From May to October of 2006, for example, the S.& P. 500 advanced 5.1 percent. Though that was still below the 8.6 percent gain from November 2005 to April 2006, it was far better than the norm. 
 Moreover, the May-to-October period has outperformed the November-to-April stretch in almost a third of the years since World War II. So it may be far too simplistic -- and risky -- to just ''sell in May and go away.'' 
 While the May-to-October window is typically frustrating, two of the best months for equities -- July and August -- fall within it. And Mr. Hirsch noted that October, which used to be considered a scary month, has turned out to be the best one for domestic stocks since 1998, on average. 
 The fact is, ''you'd prefer not to sell in May,'' said Sam Stovall, S.& P.'s chief investment strategist. 
 Even if the broad market underperforms from May to October, most types of stocks actually do quite well during that time. Since 1990, eight of the 10 stock market sectors have posted positive returns, on average, over those six months. The only exceptions were two economically sensitive sectors: basic materials and consumer-discretionary stocks. What's more, seven of the 10 sectors actually outperformed the broad S.& P. 500 during these doldrums months.
 Mr. Stovall says that selling stocks simply because the calendar has turned to May would be a risky form of market timing. ''If the odds are seven in 10 that stocks will rise,'' he said, ''you'd have to be pretty confident to be making this bet.'' 
 Still, with both corporate earnings and the economy slowing, it may be wise to think defensively. Amid slowing profits or a decelerating economy, the best-performing sectors tend to be defensive ones, like health care and consumer staples. The premise is simple: When times are tough, people may stop buying new cars and clothes, but they still need their drugs and toothpaste. 
 Not surprisingly, health care and consumer staples are among the sectors for which investors are currently most bullish, according to a recent survey of money managers by the Russell Investment Group. 
 And the seasonality argument would also call for overweighting these defensive parts of the market. Since 1990, these two areas have been the best-performing sectors in the May-to-October period, according to an analysis by S.& P. Health care stocks have risen 5.7 percent, on average, during those six months, while consumer staples have gained 5.3 percent. 
 By contrast, economically sensitive sectors have fared far worse. In addition to the consumer-discretionary and basic materials sectors -- which have historically lost value during this stretch -- shares of industrial companies have risen only 0.1 percent, on average. 
 MR. ORNDORFF of Payden & Rygel said that ''anytime you're in an environment where the overall economy is decelerating and earnings growth is also decelerating, it raises the risk that there might be a more significant correction than the one we saw at the end of February.''
 And in such an environment, he said, ''we typically like to focus on companies with more stable cash flows.'' 
 While these types of companies can be found in any number of sectors -- including some economically sensitive ones -- Mr. Orndorff said that many were typically in areas like health care and consumer staples, which don't require a strong economy in order to thrive.
 The seasonality argument, he said, only serves to bolster this line of thinking.

HEADLINE: F.H.A. Loans Stage a Comeback

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
THE federal government helped create the mortgage industry in 1934 by insuring long-term housing loans, but it has largely disappeared from the market in recent years as private lenders have led the mortgage boom. Now government loans may once again be finding a spot on the borrower's short list.
 Mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration are starting to make a comeback as banks and regulators tighten lending standards throughout the nation and turn away many low- and moderate-income homeowners. According to mortgage industry analysts and executives, such loans include important benefits not common in the current pool of conventional mortgages. 
''With all the contraction going on in the mortgage industry from subprime issues and government regulation, it's inviting a comeback of government lending,'' said Brian J. Chappelle, a founder of Potomac Partners in Washington, consultants to the mortgage industry. ''And it'll be good for consumers.''
 For instance, Mr. Chappelle said, F.H.A. loans include ''loss mitigation'' provisions often overlooked by borrowers. If borrowers miss several payments after losing a job or some other crisis beyond their control, the lender can recover that money from the government, then allow the borrower to repay it at the end of the loan.
 ''The loss mitigation effort has only been around for six or seven years,'' Mr. Chappelle said, ''but its success rate has been phenomenal in keeping people in their houses.''
 At their core, F.H.A. mortgages do not differ from conventional mortgages. The application process is similar, and the loans are made through brokers or direct lenders with roughly the same interest rates. But these mortgages are insured by the government, so if the borrower defaults, lenders are guaranteed payment.
 There are several reasons the loans have grown less common in recent years. First, the government has fairly low limits on how big a mortgage it will insure, so borrowers in New York City, for instance, can receive a loan of about $363,000, far less than the area's median home price of about $470,000. 
 In addition, the F.H.A. insures only a small range of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate products, and it obliges brokers to meet specific requirements, like maintaining a net worth of at least $63,000, with at least $12,600 in the bank. During the recent mortgage boom, private lenders -- particularly those lending to borrowers with poor credit -- created a sprawling inventory of loans that appealed to many borrowers, and lenders were liberal in inviting mortgage brokers to offer them to customers.
 A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis last year found that even though F.H.A. loans offered rates slightly lower than comparable subprime mortgages without government backing, many borrowers did not use them, partly because they did not know about them.
 But that is starting to change. Kim Neilson, the senior vice president of the McCue Mortgage Company in New Britain, Conn., said, ''We're starting to see a little bit of pickup on F.H.A. loans.''
 Ms. Neilson said the renewed interest from consumers began about two months ago, when subprime lenders began tightening their standards. ''The F.H.A. is a little more flexible when looking at someone's credit,'' she said. ''With F.H.A., someone with a 640 credit score is more likely to be approved.'' 
 Loan size, Ms. Neilson said, continues to be ''a big damper'' for many borrowers in the Northeast. For instance, in Fairfield County, Conn., the maximum F.H.A. loan for a single-family home is about $363,000, but the median price in the county's largest municipalities is $473,000. 
 Mr. Chappelle said that Congress was considering raising the maximum loan to about $600,000, which ''would obviously help a lot of borrowers, especially in the Northeast.''

 BURIED IN THE BITTER WATERS: The Hidden History of Racial Cleansing in America. By Elliot Jaspin. (Basic Books, $26.95.) Using the tools of his trade, computer-assisted reporting, Jaspin discovered a troubling demographic pattern: between 1890 and 1930, United States census data showed 260 suspect counties in which the black population appeared to fall suddenly by more than 50 percent. Jaspin ingeniously investigated the historical background of those statistical anomalies in 12 counties and found unequivocal evidence of mass racial expulsions. These incidents often began when the more familiar form of Jim Crow vigilantism, lynching, failed to satiate the mob's fury. 
The underlying motivation was usually economic competition. Two waves of intimidation in 1905 and 1909 that drove blacks out of Boone County, Ark., were typical. Ostensibly precipitated by crimes attributed to African-Americans, the expulsions followed closely on the arrival of an influx of unemployed black laborers. Why was this history ''hidden''? Jaspin points out that the concept of ''racial cleansing'' is of recent vintage, and wasn't understood by contemporaries, including the N.A.A.C.P., as a distinct category of persecution. His implied analogy to the Balkan ethnic cleansing campaigns of the 1990s is imprecise, since these American atrocities seem to have been more spontaneous and isolated. But Jaspin passionately defends his use of the term, and he recounts a rancorous struggle with his employers at Cox Newspapers, who eventually published only expurgated versions of the articles that are the basis of this book. For Jaspin, who was later demoted from editor to reporter, this was ''a demonstration of exactly how racial cleansings had come to be concealed in a thicket of lies, half-truths and euphemisms.'' THE BIRTHDAY PARTY: A Memoir of Survival. By Stanley N. Alpert. (Putnam, $24.95.) In the 1970s, muggings in the Brooklyn neighborhood where Alpert, a federal prosecutor, grew up were so frequent that they followed a shorthand script (''Yo, lend me a dime''). The racial tensions of that era form the backdrop for Alpert's account of his ordeal as the victim of a kidnapping that took place in 1998, on the night before his 38th birthday. Grabbed at gunpoint in Greenwich Village by three toughs who demanded his A.T.M. password and took $800 from his account, Alpert was then held overnight at the apartment of an associate of the kidnappers in preparation for a half-baked scheme to compel him to withdraw $50,000 from his bank the next day. The night was by turns harrowing and farcical; his captors' friends came by to eat McDonald's takeout, smoke pot and have sex in the presence of the blindfolded, terror-stricken prisoner. Alpert remained acutely alert during his captivity, psychologically manipulating his kidnappers and noting every feature of his surroundings to help investigators should he survive. The rest of his tale, a more conventional police procedural, is something of an anticlimax, though well served by his litigator's sense for dramatic pacing and the telling detail. And throughout, Alpert wins over the reader the same way he did the kidnappers, with the force of his canny, self-assured, bighearted personality. THE END OF ALLIANCES. By Rajan Menon. (Oxford, $25.) In the early years of the cold war, the United States abandoned its traditional antipathy to formal military alliances and committed itself to defend Western Europe, Japan and South Korea. This policy was an unqualified success, but now, says Menon, a professor at Lehigh University, circumstances have changed. In the future, he predicts, the United States will probably reject strict alliances in favor of looser coalitions. Even as the Pentagon resorts to stopgap measures to maintain force levels in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 150,000 American troops are stationed in Europe, Japan and South Korea. Some American commentators have begun to question the wisdom of providing subsidized security to some of the world's richest nations, while many people in those countries are bridling at their dependence on a military protector whose motives they increasingly distrust. Efforts to reconfigure a cold war institution like NATO for different missions, like humanitarian intervention or fighting terrorism, are misguided, Menon says; better to devise new arrangements. The alliance system is guarded by formidable bureaucracies and other vested interests, which argue that the costs are a small price to pay to avoid the uncertainties of a rupture. But Menon is a level-headed analyst, and though his prescription for an updated grand strategy is tentative, his diagnosis of the ills besetting the current one is persuasive. ONE OF THE GUYS: Women as Aggressors and Torturers. Edited by Tara McKelvey. Foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich. (Seal Press, paper, $15.95.) The photographs of Lynndie England's exploits in Abu Ghraib prison were not the first evidence of women's capacity for brutality, and sexual coercion has long been a tool of war. But the use of female soldiers to humiliate detainees sexually was a disturbing new development, provoking conflicting and sometimes disoriented reactions in the contributors to this anthology. Some of these essays, chosen by McKelvey, a senior editor at The American Prospect, suggest that superior officers' ordering enlisted women to employ these techniques could constitute a form of harassment; the women, says Aziz Huq, a human rights lawyer, are put in ''morally clouded roles, as both perpetrator and victim.'' Other writers in this volume insist the women -- ''willing and enthusiastic participants,'' according to the journalist Lila Rajiva -- were fully culpable. These issues are often obscured here by the opaque jargon of academic feminism (''vectors of patriarchal norms,'' ''racially gendered theater of subordination''); the clarity of the pieces by journalists and political activists comes as a relief. The standout essay is by Ada Calhoun, the editor in chief at Babble.com. It's about distinguishing good from bad kinds of empowerment. Calhoun reflects on a photograph of Jennifer Scala, an Abu Ghraib guard, shown carrying an obscenely titled book by Inga Muscio into a courtroom. The book, Calhoun says, incorporates ideas, in grossly degraded form, from a feminist ''zinefest'' subculture that had inspired her in her youth. Muscio is a ''fanatic,'' Calhoun writes, because she places ''political ends'' over what should be feminism's ethical touchstone, ''human decency.'' PERFECT FROM NOW ON: How Indie Rock Saved My Life. By John Sellers. (Simon & Schuster, $23.) Musical preferences were closely associated with status and clique among Sellers's '80s generation. So to readers of a certain age, the trajectory of his memoir could be summed up by the sequence of his (decreasingly mainstream) favorite bands, from Journey to Duran Duran to New Order to the Pixies to Pavement. The subtitle, ''How Indie Rock Saved My Life,'' is only a slight exaggeration: Sellers suggests that if he hadn't progressed beyond Journey, he might have wound up just another suburban ''meathead.'' Sellers works in the approved style of post-gonzo rock journalism, with an arch, self-deprecating, emphatic tone, digressive footnotes and ''10 best'' lists. His clowning about cheesy 1980s culture is only intermittently amusing, but whenever he immerses himself in the esoterica of alternative music the book improves. His knowledge of the subject is impressively obsessive. The central object of Sellers's very substantial enthusiasm is Guided by Voices, low-fi alt-rock purists; the climax of the book describes a night of ''giddy'' hero worship and blissful alcoholic excess spent in the company of the band's leader, Bob Pollard. A cynic might say that indie music failed to subvert the consumerism of the 1980s. After all, Sellers never really stopped identifying himself with musical brand names; he just developed gourmet taste. But those indie bands that found the sweet spot between being co-opted and being ignored served as examples of integrity and passion, helping MTV-era ironists like Sellers to grow up.

HEADLINE: For the Dow, Three Record Highs in Five Days

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market soared last week, propelling the Dow Jones industrial average to a record close on three successive days and ending the week at a new high. 
 A series of corporate earnings reports that exceeded Wall Street's expectations appeared to be the principal reason for the market's buoyancy, but there was strong economic data as well.
In a report on inflation on Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, was running at a 2.5 percent annual rate through March -- lower than had been anticipated on Wall Street, and 0.2 percentage point below the annual rate through February.
 Honeywell shares rose 9.3 percent for the week, the best showing among the Dow Jones industrials. The company reported a 21 percent gain in first-quarter earnings.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 349.85 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 12,961.98. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 31.50 points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 1,484.35. The Nasdaq composite index rose 34.45 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,526.39. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.67 percent from 4.76 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Rail Line Drives Utah Development

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: MURRAY CITY, Utah 

 BODY:
TWO years ago, this Salt Lake City suburb began collaborating with a local developer to turn industrial land into a neighborhood of town homes, condominiums and offices. Now the project, known as Birkhill at Fireclay, is finally being built. 
 The 30-acre $140 million development by Hamlet Homes, one of this region's largest builders, will have 420 units of housing and 200,000 square feet of retail and office space. Groundbreaking is set to begin in about a month. The idea is to give homeowners easier access to their jobs or to stores.
Murray City and Hamlet Homes are taking advantage of growing buyer interest in living and working near the regional TRAX light rail system, which has operated in the Salt Lake Valley since 1999. The Murray North station, one of three TRAX stops in Murray City -- population 50,000 -- serves as the centerpiece of Birkhill at Fireclay.
 ''People can go where they want and won't have to get in a car,'' said Keith Snarr, the director of Murray City's economic development office, who helped negotiate the agreement with Hamlet Homes. ''It may not be the lifestyle for everybody, but there are a lot of people around here now that understand what it means to be urban and find this attractive.'' 
 Salt Lake City and its closest suburbs built the $520 million, 19-mile, 23-station TRAX system, which carries more than 55,000 riders a day, well ahead of ridership projections. Voters have also repeatedly passed sales tax increases, including one approved last November, to spend $2.5 billion more in the next decade to complete 26 additional miles of light rail, 88 miles of heavy commuter rail line and nearly 40 extra station stops. The only American metropolitan area that is building more regional rapid transit capacity is Denver, which is constructing a 151-mile system. 
 Birkhill at Fireclay is the first development in a 97-acre transit-oriented district Murray City has established around the Murray North station. And it is one of a growing number of transit-oriented developments in the Wasatch Front, an urban area with a population of more than two million that is looking for new ways to get around -- less by car, and especially by rail. A host of other American metropolitan regions, among them Minneapolis, Denver, Dallas, Sacramento, St. Louis, Phoenix, San Diego, Seattle and Portland, Ore., have invested billions of dollars over the last decade to pursue the same idea. 
 Mr. Snarr says he is convinced that the confluence of fast-rising energy and land costs, static incomes and the region's swift population growth are producing the market conditions for a successful new neighborhood on land along Fireclay Avenue that has served as his city's industrial backyard.
 The existing 23 rail stations and the roughly 40 more stops on the way offer developers dozens of opportunities to design and build transit-focused home and business districts at the center of the Salt Lake Valley's towns and cities. 
 ''The basic reason that transit-oriented development is working in Utah and other places is largely demographic,'' said Gloria Ohland, vice president for communications at Reconnecting America, a national transit research group based in Oakland, Calif. ''American households are older, smaller and more diverse,'' she said. ''Singles are 41 percent of the population. People who are single and couples that have no children -- those are the people who gravitate to cities.''
 Even with a new tide of people heading their way, transit-focused builders say there are plenty of impediments. Assembling parcels large enough to be attractive requires considerable work in city and town centers. It took Hamlet Homes more than two years to amass the 30 acres for Birkhill at Fireclay. 
 And in most communities, including Murray City, the zoning regulations that directed homes and businesses to be spread far apart have to be rewritten. Murray City passed a transit development ordinance in 2005 that allows narrower streets, encourages trees and pocket parks, and is designed to produce a new district that is not too densely built up, but also won't look or feel anything like a typical single-use suburban subdivision.
 Michael Brodsky, the chairman of Hamlet Homes, which he founded in 1995, said the difficulties involved in developing around the Salt Lake region's transit stops are compensated for by the market response. Along with Birkhill at Fireclay, the company is constructing two more housing and business developments near the TRAX stations immediately north and south of the Murray North stop. 
 The first is Inverness Square, a $24 million, 120-unit project half a mile from the 53rd South TRAX station. The development, started in 2005, is nearly completed, and the two- and three-bedroom town houses, with prices starting around $170,000, are sold out, Mr. Brodsky said. 
 Last October, the company began developing Waverly Station, on 10 acres alongside the Meadowbrook TRAX station. The $42 million project includes 47 condos, 131 town homes and 14,000 square feet of retail and office space. Hamlet just completed the first phase -- 41 two- and three-bedroom town homes of 1,500 to 1,900 square feet. All have been sold, Mr. Brodsky said, for $215,000 to $255,000.
 ''The fact that we are building close to the light rail station is an important amenity,'' he said. ''It is part of the package that also includes a combination of affordability and accessibility to a more urban setting.'' 
 Mary Ann Downs, 22, an interior designer, moved into her $193,000 three-bedroom home at Waverly Station in February. Ms. Downs is happy to be near the TRAX system -- she plans to use it this spring when the light rail connects to the new commuter line -- and she also likes her neighbors.
 One of them is David Bailey, 28, who works for a jewelry dealer. He bought a two-bedroom home for $205,000. He said access to the TRAX line, which he rides to basketball and football games downtown, played a part in his decision to buy. ''I really feel as gas prices go up, homes near public transportation will increase in value,'' he said.
 North of Salt Lake City, CenterCal Properties just closed on a $2.13 million purchase of 70 acres near the new commuter rail station in Farmington, a bedroom community of 14,000 residents 13 miles north of Salt Lake City and one of nine stops on a 44-mile, $611 million line to Pleasant View that is scheduled to open in the spring of 2008. 
 CenterCal, based in Portland, Ore., earned a national reputation in transit-oriented design with its Gresham Station, a 130-acre, $400 million, mixed-use district that it began in 1999 along the MAX light rail line east of Portland. 
 Fred Bruning, the company's president, said CenterCal planned to bring the same principles of compact, transit-focused design to its new project, called Station Park, which will be just across the Farmington rail station's parking lot. It will consist of 700,000 square feet of retailing, 300,000 square feet of office space and 250 residential units in rental apartments and town homes.
 A rendering of Station Park on the company's Web site (centercal.com) shows a district designed with three-story buildings, with shops on the ground floor and offices and homes on the floors above, surrounding a large public square with a fountain, broad sidewalks and a garden. The project's design is a mix of European urbanism and outdoor suburban lifestyle malls. 
 ''Compared to what is already there in Farmington, this is a lot of density,'' Mr. Bruning said. ''You have to take it in steps and develop density as the market becomes available. We design our projects in such a way that density can increase over time. If it's designed well, it has a shelf life for decades.''
 The design is intended to mimic urban spaces in which buildings change uses -- open spaces can be filled, or buildings can become open space. 
 Mr. Snarr, Murray City's development director, has similar plans for the Birkhill at Fireclay, which is priced comparably with the Waverly Station development, and for other projects he is recruiting for the city's transit-oriented district. ''People want to live in a place that's a little more cosmopolitan,'' he said. ''They gain a lot. They save money on gas and housing costs. They reduce their stress because they don't have to drive as much. And they get a chance to know their neighbors. It adds up for me.''

HEADLINE: Mortgages' Mystery: The Losses

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
HAVE you noticed how quickly financial market crises come and go nowadays? Refco, the venerable commodities firm, disintegrated in a week in 2005 and last year's demise of Amaranth, a $6 billion hedge fund, took about the same amount of time. It is a measure of how deep and wide the money pools are today that the billions lost at these institutions amounted to no more than a blip on a screen.
 The mortgage mess, however, has a different look and feel. As much as investors, lenders and home sellers want it to be over, it is likely to drag on. 
There are several reasons for this. Working out troubled loans one by one takes time. So does selling tracts of empty homes. 
 But there is also this: Because of the way mortgages are packaged into pools and sold to investors, it is still not clear who owns the faltering loans and how much money has been lost. 
 This episode seems to be unfolding in slow motion. 
 Certainly, the bad news keeps coming. Last week, we learned that foreclosure rates soared 47 percent in March over the same period in 2006. 
 RealtyTrac, a keeper of a database of properties in foreclosure or about to be, reported that California had 31,434 foreclosures in March, nearly triple the figure from the same period last year. Foreclosure rates in Nevada and Colorado also surged.
 Fears are rising among builders as well. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Home Price Index, a measure of builder confidence, fell to 33 in April. Last year at this time, the index stood at 51. 
 ''The tightening of mortgage lending standards in connection with the subprime crisis has shaken the confidence of both consumers and builders,'' said David F. Seiders, the chief economist at the home builders association.
 Mr. Seiders did not mention investors, but they can't be happy, either. A report from asset-backed-securities analysts at Lehman Brothers last week estimated that some $19 billion in losses are sitting in loan pools assembled in 2005, 2006 and early 2007. Most of these losses are in collateralized debt obligations, securities that invested aggressively in mortgages in recent years and that pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds all hold. 
 Lehman estimates losses of $1.5 billion on 2005 issues, $11.4 billion on those from 2006 and an additional $5.9 billion from the 2007 vintage, including those still in the pipeline. Sound like a lot of money? It is: the $18.8 billion accounts for about 5.5 percent of all mortgages issued and outstanding in the period. 
 These figures are estimates, not actual losses, because accounting rules allow pension funds and insurance companies that hold these securities to mark their stakes at the prices they paid for them, not at the current market levels. The losses are there, but they remain unrecorded. 
 Only when these investors sell their holdings do they have to book the loss they incur. That's no fun, so investors are likely to hang on to their holdings as long as they can. If they need liquidity, they could be pushed to sell, of course. Another thing that could force sales: a downgrade by Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch Ratings, the credit rating agencies. Most pension funds and insurance companies cannot hold securities that are rated below investment grade -- ''junk'' in industry parlance.
 This has not yet happened, to the immense relief of investors, no doubt. Notwithstanding all the news about defaults, delinquencies and foreclosures, the rating agencies have not downgraded many mortgage loans because, they say, they do not expect their original assumptions regarding the loans' performance to change substantially. 
 As Susan Barnes, a managing director at S.& P., told Congress last week, the firm had downgraded just 0.3 percent of the subprime issues it rated, as of April 12. ''While we do not expect there to be widespread downgrades,'' she explained, ''if the marketplace or economy as a whole experiences further financial distress, there could be a more prolonged period of negative performance, and S.& P. may need to take further rating actions.''
 WHILE investors have not had to face harsh market realities, homeowners looking to refinance their loans will not be as fortunate as lenders tighten their underwriting standards and home prices soften, according to Lehman. Lehman says it expects that 20 percent to 30 percent of borrowers who took out loans last year will be unable to refinance their mortgages when the terms of their loans reset. The firm said that it expects as many as 15 percent of borrowers who struck deals in 2005 to be shut out of the mortgage market when they try to refinance. 
 If true, this will increase defaults on these loans significantly. Lehman estimates cumulative losses of 11.4 percent on 2006 loans and almost 13 percent on 2007 loans. 
 These estimates may prove high, Lehman said, if mortgage lenders and servicers offer generous loan modifications to struggling borrowers. 
 And last week, investors were heartened by Freddie Mac's announcement that this summer it would begin offering $20 billion in loans to borrowers trying to refinance their mortgages. Fannie Mae, another big mortgage lender, has also agreed to put money into a refinancing pot.
 That's great for borrowers, but not for investors in existing mortgage pools, said Thomas A. Lawler, founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting. He noted last week that these initiatives would attract the better borrowers, those who could meet more stringent lending requirements, such as being able to muster a 20 percent down payment and document appropriate income levels. 
 But as these people pay off their existing loans, two problems arise for investors. The prepayment of the loan means expected income from it disappears, and it also leaves mortgage pool investors with a greater proportion of troubled borrowers. 
 ''To the extent that the availability of these programs makes it possible for better subprime borrowers to refinance away from current lenders and into a better mortgage product,'' Mr. Lawler said, ''it's hard to see how that will be beneficial to the existing holders of subordinated subprime loans.'' 
 Fannie and Freddie, in other words, are not putting out the welcome mat for mortgage loans that should never have been made. Those remain squarely in the hands of investors. We may not know who they are. But they do.

WAY MORE WEST
 New and Selected Poems.
 By Edward Dorn.
 Edited by Michael Rothenberg.
 321 pp. Penguin Poets. Paper. $20.
EdWARD Dorn, who died in 1999 at 70, published more than two dozen volumes of poetry in his lifetime, all of them originally with small presses, most now ignored or forgotten except by a not terribly large coterie of longtime readers and other writers. ''Way More West,'' at over 300 pages, provides a more than ample retrospective of Dorn's achievement.
 Dorn was identified, and identified himself, throughout his career with Black Mountain College, the small, financially struggling North Carolina experimental school whose teachers included, among others: Joseph Albers, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Walter Gropius, Buckminster Fuller, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Harry Callahan and Robert Creeley. Dorn turned up there in 1951, originally as a painter. But he soon came under the tutelage of the brilliant, charismatic teacher and poet Charles Olson, who was then more or less in charge of running the college. 
 No one got more out of Black Mountain than Dorn, who had been raised among the working poor in rural Illinois and Michigan and had already knocked around a fair bit, especially out West, where he traveled and worked as an itinerant laborer. He'd had some university education in Illinois, which, Dorn would always maintain, was ''somewhat corrected'' at Black Mountain. A large part of that correction was administered by Olson and various writers he recommended, like Carl O. Sauer, who wrote about the human impact on landscape over time. Olson insisted geography was one of the great American subjects: where one stands and the history of what's transpired underfoot is the primary determinant in how one understands the world. For Dorn, the American West, with which he had already developed a fascination, was to become the laboratory for his poetic project.
 Ed Dorn's poetry fits roughly into three periods: the early, Black Mountain-influenced poems; the long poem in four parts, alternately titled ''Gunslinger'' and ''Slinger''; and the later poems, chiefly epigrammatic, satiric and political.
 The best work is the early work, written in his late 20s and early 30s. Six uncollected poems, all beauties, appeared in Donald Allen's ''The New American Poetry, 1945-1960'' -- these would have been, for most readers, the first encounter with Dorn's work. This was followed by the publication of two collections from LeRoi Jones's Totem Press, ''The Newly Fallen'' and ''Hands Up!,'' issued in 1962 and 1963.
 Some of these poems, with their irregular and persistent rhymes and impersonal tone, seem to owe more to the Elizabethans and early ballads than to Olson's sprawling, abstract, wildly discursive poetry and his notions of what he termed ''projective verse.'' The lessons from Olson are there, but assimilated, and poems like ''The Rick of Green Wood,'' ''The Hide of My Mother'' and ''On the Debt My Mother Owed to Sears Roebuck'' are as distinctly American and austere and lovely in design as a Shaker cabinet. One can almost smell the freshly planed maple:
 For a point of etiquette,
 when I observed she was digging
 the neighbor's English Privet,
 I said, it grows in abundance here.
 As a matter of fact, she had it,
 I thought I saw a rabbit,
 that's why I came over here.
 I said, a plant like that might grow anywhere.
 Well now, I suppose you are right
 back home our elms have the blight
 but the land is flat there
 so many mountains hereabouts
 Yes, I allowed, it must help the sprouts ... 
 Dorn's next four books, published between 1964 and 1967 in England, where he has always enjoyed a larger reputation than in the United States, are all substantial and of interest, but show the poet drifting toward a poetry of ideas -- the language is more abstract, the tone is often didactic or censorious and the poems now spread out; the once expertly handled, supple measures begin to dissolve into prose.
 Then, in 1968, Black Sparrow Press published ''Gunslinger, Book I,'' included here in this New and Selected. The poem -- the last of its four books was released in 1974 -- comes out of left field. Nothing in the previous work seems to anticipate it. The influence of Olson and Black Mountain is no longer in evidence, as it had been earlier, especially in the volumes published in England. It is altogether a brilliant and strange performance, with no true parallels in American poetry, at least up until then: comedic, phantasmagoric, a mix of spaghetti western, psychedelic cartoon, allegory and quest saga, chockablock with puns, gags and metaphysical, epistemological and phenomenological asides, not to mention plenty of first-rate poetry. It's a mess, to be sure, but a glorious mess, featuring a 2,000-year-old Gunslinger, his pot-smoking, talking horse, Claude Levi-Strauss, a formidable brothel owner named Lil who seems to be in charge of things, not to mention a character named ''I'' who is disposed of partway through, only to reappear a couple of books later as the messenger of the pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides. It's a druggy poem, written at a druggy time. The voice, which Dorn handles with mad aplomb, continually transforms from hipster to Hollywood cowboy to mock literary, spouting scientific terms and speculations on the nature of language as it all proceeds, vaguely in the direction of Howard Hughes in Las Vegas. If it's not the major 20th-century long poem a number of serious critics claim it to be -- it's all over the place, hit and miss, and some of the gags go on too long, like an inside joke among stoned friends -- it's the work of a brilliant, wildly original, very funny poet firing on all cylinders.
 fter ''Gunslinger'' there's a precipitous, rather mysterious, falling off in the quality of Dorn's poetry, from roughly 1974 on. From the beginning, Dorn's sense of the primacy of landscape and geography, along with the depredations visited upon it by the state and unrestrained capital, informs the poetry, directly or indirectly. Dorn knew firsthand about the victimization of the poor, the dispossessed and working people, and he knew which side he was on. But the political urgency of the later writing seems to overtake the poetry and, finally, to undermine it. The poetry has turned into prose, and not very interesting prose. The political, cultural and economic ''abhorrences'' (as he called them), however righteous, are commonplace. The satire and invective are, for the most part, flat. Although, to be fair, some of the funniest bits, left out of this collection, dwell in the range between tasteless and ugly. There's a pervasive carping, splenetic tone that pervades these last books, sinking them.
 But that's Dorn. Throughout his career, he was the least endearing, domesticated or predictable of poets, always determined to go his own way, no matter what anyone thought. And if he hadn't been that way, American poetry would be a lot less vital and interesting.

HEADLINE: Lower Manhattan, Higher Testosterone

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The Web site for the William Beaver House in Lower Manhattan, where the cheapest studio apartment now goes for $950,000, features a photograph of two women seductively nibbling corn on the cob. A biography of the building's mythical mascot, a martini-toting beaver-about-town, reveals that he hangs out ''where life is sleek and times are thrilling.''
 The sales pitch for the 47-story building, going up at the corner of William and Beaver Streets across from Delmonico's, is unabashedly capitalizing on, and perhaps perpetuating, a phenomenal population shift downtown. Men now outnumber women there by a ratio usually found in towns with all-male colleges, military bases and prisons, and in a few enclaves in Silicon Valley that have high concentrations of engineers and workers in other male-dominated fields.
Since 2000, men, mostly between ages 25 and 44, have accounted for more than three-fourths of the population increase in Lower Manhattan. As a result, according to a special census calculation, the sex ratio there increased to 126 men per 100 women in 2005, from 101 men per 100 women in 2000. In the rest of Manhattan, and in the city over all, there were only 90 men for every 100 women. 
 ''For a normal, noninstitutional setting,'' said A. Peter Lobo, deputy director of the City Planning Department's population division, ''I would say it is among the highest sex ratios that you would see.''
 The census survey, coupled with interviews last week, suggests that what has driven the shift is an influx of well-heeled workaholics on male-dominated Wall Street who prefer short commutes. Nearly one-third of the residents said they walked to work.
 ''We're seeing a lot of young professionals with very high income, young Wall Street bankers and lawyers who want to be steps from home,'' said Eric J. Deutsch, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business group. ''It's still a bit of a pioneering neighborhood, and in a pioneering neighborhood you often see more single men and young couples.''
 The statistics come from a Census Bureau analysis of its 2005 American Community Survey that was commissioned by Planning Department demographers seeking to quantify changes to Lower Manhattan since 9/11. The demographers presented the findings last month to the Population Association of America.
 Because they commissioned a special tabulation, precise comparisons with other areas are difficult. 
 The demographers eliminated group quarters like New York University and Pace University dormitories from their calculations and had to make adjustments to compare the 2000 census with the 2005 American Community Survey, but said they were confident that the samples were representative. 
 The area studied encompassed the neighborhoods south of Canal Street, but excluded most of east Chinatown and the area between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges. The area does not include neighborhoods like Chelsea and others known for high populations of gay men.
 ''I always thought downtown had a high testosterone level, but this ratio is a surprise even to me,'' said Carl Weisbrod, Mr. Deutsch's predecessor at the Downtown Alliance and now president of Trinity Real Estate. 
 The male majority in Lower Manhattan is even more striking considering the city's overall tilt toward women. In some neighborhoods, the ratio can be as low as 70 men to 100 women. And it is even lower in places like East New York and Brownsville in Brooklyn -- a result, researchers say, of a high incidence of murder, imprisonment, unemployment and homelessness -- and in the Rockaways, which includes neighborhoods where residents are mostly poor and others where they are disproportionately elderly. 
 Downtown Manhattan has thrived in spite of the terrorist attack, in part because of the city's healthy financial sector and government and private subsidies to encourage people to move there after 9/11. 
 New buildings like the William Beaver have gone up, and some office buildings have been converted to luxury residences. The number of residents in the neighborhoods studied by the city demographers surged 26 percent, to 43,650 in 2005 compared with 34,698 in 2000, according to the Census Bureau. 
 But despite its central location, as a neighborhood, Lower Manhattan can still seem like an outpost, with fewer shopping and after-hours options than in other well-to-do parts of the city. Workers outnumber residents there 8 to 1.
 ''I think that men may be a bit more prepared to move into a weird, slowly developing neighborhood than women are,'' said Marcus Friedman, 25, who moved downtown last fall after graduating from Brooklyn Law School. ''I know that neither me nor my roommates put a large premium on the restaurants and nightlife in the area, as we all work terrible hours, and when we go out we don't go out downtown. We value how spacious our apartment is, the amenities of our building and the excellent subway accessibility -- I work off of Times Square. 
 ''I don't mean to generalize,'' Mr. Friedman said, ''but most of the girls I am cool with have a bit more vested in their neighborhood than commute and apartment size. They would rather sacrifice one or the other to have the restaurants and bar scene that they want close by.''
 Lower Manhattan bars are crowded early in the evening, but they often empty out as workers head home to other parts of the city or the suburbs. Puffy's Tavern on Hudson Street began a happy hour to attract patrons with discount drinks -- from 1 to 4 a.m. 
 Matthew Carpenter, a 38-year-old technology manager who lives in a loft on Thompson Street, agreed that ''a lot of women don't want to work the 80-hour week, so being close to work is not that important.''
 Wilson Lau, 32, a sales representative for a biotechnology company who lives on Nassau Street, said that he was not aware of the gender gap, but he had noticed a proliferation of cigar bars. ''I think men don't mind that there is nothing going on around in the area after 7 p.m., where women may find that more intimidating or less safe,'' he said.
 Susan Naci, who sells advertising for a magazine and lives in TriBeCa with her husband, said men seemed less sensitive about living close to the World Trade Center site. ''I tell my single girlfriends all the time to go out for drinks in my neighborhood because it's where all those rumored-to-exist eligible bachelors are,'' she said. 
 Leah Hyman, who is 43 and works as a hospital volunteer, expressed a ''sort of pride'' that she lives near ground zero, adding: ''Is the preponderance of young men good or bad for women? As a single woman, I guess I should say yes -- but I need to get out more.'' 
 Generalizations are hazardous, and downtown neighborhoods are still evolving. But it is probably fair to say that families with children tend to gravitate toward Battery Park City, couples to TriBeCa and single young men to the Financial District. 
 Even so, said Whitney G. Hess, a 24-year old designer, ''Everyone I know living below Canal Street is a woman. We all agree that we're somewhat isolated from the rest of the city, but we like it that way. The neighborhood is quiet and empty on the weeknights, but there is a lot of activity on the weekends.''
 By next year, according to estimates by the Alliance for Downtown New York, the number of apartments south of Chambers Street will have doubled, to 26,000, since 2000, and more than twice as many people, 46,000, will be living there.
 The city demographers who conducted the research, Mr. Lobo, Joseph J. Salvo and Joel A. Alvarez, said that as a result of a 46 percent surge in men 25 to 44 years old, that category's share of the downtown population grew to 51 percent in 2005 from 44 percent in 2000.
 They found disproportionate numbers of white, Asian and foreign-born residents. People living downtown also were more likely than other Manhattanites to have roommates who were not family members. The median household income, which jumped 20 percent from 2000 to 2005, was $98,000 -- nearly double the figure for the rest of the borough.
 While the number of workers in Lower Manhattan declined after 9/11, the study said it appeared that new residents continued to arrive. In 2005, 22 percent of residents there said they had been living in another apartment just one year earlier.
 Andrew Hacker, a political scientist at Queens College who wrote ''Mismatch: The Growing Gulf Between Men and Women,'' said that demographically speaking, ''a jump from 101 to 126 guys per 100 girls in only five years is hyper-unusual. You generally only get that kind of population leap in super-booming Arizona suburbs.
 ''Of course,'' he added, ''New York women will tell you that, to them, it looks like 200 of them for every 100 men. But, then, they mean 'eligible' men.''

THE BLACK SWAN
 The Impact of the Highly Improbable.
 By Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
 366 pages. Random House. $26.95.
On the eve of the 2006 hurricane season, the National Hurricane Center forecast a ''hyperactive'' summer and fall, with eight to 10 Atlantic cyclones; instead there were five, smack on the 20th-century average. At the beginning of 2006, The Wall Street Journal forecast a bad year for stocks; the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16 percent that year. (Disturbingly, The Journal has forecast a good year for 2007.) The British government recently said climate change could reduce global G.D.P. by 13.8 percent in the first year of the 23rd century. Not by 13.7 percent, not by 13.9 percent -- by 13.8 percent. In response to an astronomer's discovery, The New York Times in 2004 declared that the universe might have a ''peaceful end'' in ''tens of billions of years,'' but cautioned that it could not rule out the cosmos's exploding in a few billion years. Writing of the same discovery, The Washington Post predicted that the demise of the cosmos would require 30 billion years, adding this vital caveat: ''It remains impossible to predict the fate of the universe with certainty.'' Oh, so we can't be certain what will happen 30 billion years from now! 
 The hubris of predictions -- and our perpetual surprise when the not-predicted happens -- are themes of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's engaging new book, ''The Black Swan.'' It concerns the occurrence of the improbable, the power of rare events and the author's lament that ''in spite of the empirical record we continue to project into the future as if we were good at it.'' We expect all swans to be white and are shocked when a black swan swims by.
 Born in Lebanon in 1960, Taleb lived through a ''black swan'' when his serene homeland was cast into the chaos of civil war in 1975. After emigrating to the United States, he attended Wharton, then worked on Wall Street; today he is a professor at the University of Massachusetts. Black Monday in 1987, when Wall Street suffered its worst single-day decline in modern history -- in a drop that started for no clear reason -- was his epiphany. Chance, he realized, has far more influence than we care to admit.
 In his 2001 book ''Fooled by Randomness,'' which became a surprise hit in the months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Taleb drew on his experience as an options trader to argue that stock-market projections are worthless because no one has any idea where prices are headed. After prices unexpectedly rise or fall, he wrote, experts impose specious retroactive narratives to divert attention from their ignorance. In ''The Black Swan,'' Taleb proclaims that the unexpected is the key to understanding not just financial markets but history itself.
 History, he writes, proceeds by ''jumps,'' controlled by ''the tyranny of the singular, the accidental, the unseen and the unpredicted.'' Gradual change is our paradigm, yet actual change is ''almost always outlandish.'' And don't get Taleb started on the Experts. Experts are charlatans who believe in bell curves, in which most distribution is toward the center -- ordinary and knowable. Far more powerful, Taleb argues, are the wild outcomes of fractal geometry, in which anything can happen overnight. (''The Black Swan'' is dedicated to Benoit Mandelbrot, godfather of fractal geometry.)
 ''The Black Swan'' has appealing cheek and admirable ambition, and contains such wise observations as: ''We attribute our successes to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control.'' But the book exhibits shortcomings, the first being lack of structure. Much of ''The Black Swan'' boils down to denouncing others for failing to see the future -- though who exactly can see the future? And on this point Taleb overgeneralizes, for instance scoffing that the collapse of the Soviet Union was an unfathomably unlikely event that ''no social scientist saw coming.'' The historian John Mueller's brilliant 1989 book, ''Retreat From Doomsday,'' published just before the Berlin Wall fell, did see it coming.
 ''The Black Swan'' criticizes society for failing to expect extreme events. But it makes sense to focus mainly on preparing for what is likely. NASA should watch for asteroids that might collide with Earth -- unfortunately, it doesn't -- but there is a certain reasonableness to the average person not being ever on guard against low-probability developments. Taleb complains that Wall Street traders attend his talks and then go back to making stock forecasts full of rubbish. But making forecasts is their job. Why customers (especially institutional investors) keep demanding Wall Street forecasts if such projections are really worthless is a question Taleb does not answer.
 Taleb offers his ideas about unpredictability and luck as breakthrough concepts, yet others have been here before. Christopher Cerf and Victor Navasky's hilarious book ''The Experts Speak'' (1984) chronicled highfalutin drivel, while James Gleick's ''Chaos'' (1987) addressed Mandelbrot, fractal geometry and the limits of prediction. Jackson Lears's ''Something for Nothing'' (2003) analyzed why the dominant American ''culture of control'' denies the importance of luck. Richard A. Posner's ''Catastrophe'' (2004) argued that the government should prepare for extraordinary events. As for the Experts, Philip E. Tetlock's ''Expert Political Judgment'' (2005) provided extensive detail on their dismal forecasting records. Taleb mentions most of these books in his bibliography, but except for Tetlock he doesn't give them their due in his text.
 Taleb ridicules distinguished economists while presenting himself as a lonely, persecuted genius. He declares that Harry M. Markowitz and William F. Sharpe, winners (with Merton H. Miller) of the 1990 Nobel Prize for theories of capital markets, sold ''quack remedies'' that ''everyone in the business world'' knew to be ''fraud.'' Taleb asserts that another Nobelist, Myron S. Scholes, flew into a ''state of rage'' on hearing his ideas, while a member of the French Academy of Sciences ''blew a fuse ... right when I showed empirical evidence of the role of black swans in markets. He turned red with anger, had difficulty breathing and started hurling insults at me.''
 Criticizing the accomplished is healthy; mocking them because they are accomplished is sophomoric. Given the thousands of smart people trying to game the global equities system, it's a wonder the market mainly rises and that things don't go haywire more often. Maybe the appalling theories of those sinister establishment economists actually do improve market stability.
 When ''The Black Swan'' tries to expand from finance into a general theory of history, it falters further owing to lack of evidence. Beyond Black Monday and the Lebanese civil war, here are some of the other ''highly improbable'' developments Taleb mentions: the Cuban revolution, the Iranian revolution, the Internet, new pharmaceuticals and many scientific discoveries. But to say that discoveries are unexpected is a circularity -- to anticipate discoveries, we would need to possess the knowledge entailed and so wouldn't need the discovery. Black Monday led to a lot of crying into martinis, but two years laterWall Street had recovered its losses. Trends in microelectronics and space-relayed communication made the development of the Internet likely (writings of the 1970s predicted the Web), even if no one knew when or exactly how it would emerge. And were the Cuban and Iranian revolutions really total bolts from the blue?
 Ultimately, Taleb's book shipwrecks on the story of Yevgenia Krasnova, ''a neuroscientist with an interest in philosophy'' whose unheralded first novel (which ''avoided the journalistic prevarications of contemporary narrative nonfiction'') became a blockbuster, while her heavily promoted second novel flopped. Taleb describes her books as exemplary black swans, succeeding when expected to fail and failing when expected to succeed. But Krasnova's experience hardly sounds ''highly improbable.'' The sequence of events is a publishing-industry cliche. More important, Krasnova does not exist. Taleb fabricated her, which he admits only in a footnote and in the index. If Taleb were on to a general theme of history, he wouldn't have to invent his examples.

 BODY:
MATTERS were simpler 100 years ago, when junior colleges were created to prepare deserving students for the final two years of a university. In fact, the very first public junior college, in Joliet, Ill., was set up in a high school, as the equivalent of grades 13 and 14. 
 Community colleges today do far more than offer a ladder to the final years. They train the people who repair your furnace, install your plumbing, take your pulse. They prepare retiring baby boomers for second or third careers, and provide opportunities for a growing number of college-age students turning away from the high cost and competition at universities. And charged with doing the heavy remedial lifting, community colleges are now as much 10th and 11th grade as 13th and 14th.
It's a long to-do list on a tightening public purse. Two-year colleges receive less than 30 percent of state and local financing for higher education, according to the American Association of Community Colleges. Yet they are growing much faster than four-year colleges and universities, enrolling nearly half of all undergraduates. That's 6.6 million students. Add those taking just a course or two, and the total reaches some 12 million. 
 Kay M. McClenney, director of the annual Community College Survey of Student Engagement, calls America's two-year colleges ''today's Ellis Island,'' because they serve a disproportionate number of immigrants, first-generation citizens and minorities. 
 While filming a documentary for PBS, ''Discounted Dreams: High Hopes and Harsh Realities at America's Community Colleges,'' my colleagues and I visited dozens of classrooms across the country and met with hundreds of students whose stories reveal the possibilities and limitations of community colleges. 
 On these pages are four of the students -- and the dreams they are chasing. MIDLIFE, STARTING OVER The wait list for nursing programs can be years long. Brian Bullas 'won the lottery.' 
 It says something about Brian Bullas that he participated, twice, in Hawaii's Ironman Triathlon -- a 140-mile endurance course suitable for only the most fit and the most driven. You might not know that about Mr. Bullas by watching him on the job, mixing drinks on the working side of the bar at the Marine Room, a clubby, candlelit restaurant with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking San Diego harbor. 
 ''I probably see 300 sunsets a year out these windows,'' he said one recent dusk, jovial and relaxed. ''I've been medicating people for 26 years, and now I'll finally get to do it the right way.'' 
 At 51, he is determined to redefine himself. With his wife working days, bartending seemed a logical career choice when his son was small. Today, he has a different view. ''As good as it's been, bartending has been a pretty stagnant job,'' he said. ''I think I can give more to myself and to my family and to society by trying a new career that I think I'm going to be good at.'' 
 After graduating from San Diego City College next month and passing the licensing exam, Mr. Bullas will be a registered nurse. He will be in great demand, because the country desperately needs nurses. The national shortfall, of about 6 percent, is particularly acute in California. A 2006 report by the Hospital Association of Southern California estimates that the state currently needs 22,500 registered nurses and predicted a shortage of 116,000 by 2020. Two-year institutions train some 60 percent of the nation's new nurses. 
 Yet Mr. Bullas says he ''won the lottery'' when he was able to start classes. He did get lucky: three of four applicants to City's nursing program are accepted but are immediately placed on a waiting list. There just isn't enough room. 
 ''They're qualified, we tell them they're qualified, but then they have to go off and flip burgers or tend bar or do whatever, until their number comes up,'' says Terrence Burgess, the college president. ''It's not uncommon up and down the state to have wait lists that go two and three years out.'' He adds, ''We refer to it as our five-year plan.'' That is, considering the prerequisites, which most applicants need to take, and at least a year on the waiting list, a nursing education can easily take half a dozen years. 
 For colleges, granting nursing degrees is a losing proposition. Classes require expensive equipment and must be small. They can cost three times as much as a chalk-and-talk class, Mr. Burgess says, but the state pays the college the same per-student rate. 
 Mr. Bullas chose this route because City's nursing classes are scheduled for the convenience of working adults and because the cost is low. 
 Community colleges attract a lot of men and women like Brian Bullas. In a study conducted by ACT Inc. and the American Association of Community Colleges, more than 35 percent of students indicated that changing careers was the major reason they were taking classes.
 Mr. Bullas already has a degree in sociology from the University of San Diego, where he played varsity baseball. He was drafted by the Oakland A's but played only in the minors and Canada, he says, before turning to restaurant work and bartending. The road to where he is today has been a triathlon of classwork and clinical and personal responsibilities -- eight hours two days a week at the hospital and two in the classroom; four or five nights, eight hours a night, at the Marine Room. ''I have a couple of days where I carpool kids to school, do the shopping, and help out with homework when I can with my son,'' he said. 
 The stress, just getting through it, shows in his face. It helps that his wife (''a saint'') has a good job managing a health club. ''I do keep in contact with her to let her know where I am and what I'm doing,'' he said, laughing.
 Mr. Bullas has studied in a parking lot, waiting for his son at baseball or basketball or water polo; he does schoolwork behind the bar when it's slow. ''They let you know that you should have a book in your car at all times,'' he said. 
 He is a focused learner who furiously takes notes during a demonstration of an IV pole. Afterward, he goes up to the teacher to ask questions.
 He thinks about that day when he will enter a patient's room for the first time on his own. ''I know I'm going to have support,'' he said. ''But I also know that the patient's life is in my hand, and I want to be sure I've done my homework.'' LIFELONG LEARNING What 'Salsa Dancing' taught a hairstylist, besides rhythm. 
 A t a strip mall in Joliet, an hour's drive southwest of Chicago, 19-year-old Stacey Jurgens spends long days on her feet styling hair. One evening a week, she escapes to the cavernous, faded banquet hall of an old hotel, now part of Joliet Junior College. ''I love Latin music, the beats and the rhythm,'' she said. ''Dancing to the music sets me free.''
 Her classmates, none as accomplished on the dance floor as she, include a 51-year-old store manager whose wife drags him there and a construction company manager and his girlfriend, who wanted to try something new. ''Salsa Dancing'' meets six times and costs $74.
 This is Ms. Jurgens's fourth evening class. ''I took a beginner salsa class with my dad,'' she said, ''and that was so much fun I signed up for 'Hip-Hop Dancing' and 'Advanced Salsa.' '' Ms. Jurgens is participating in what community college catalogs call continuing education or, in the latest jargon, lifelong learning. At Cuyahoga Community College, in Cleveland, students play simulated versions of classic game shows in ''Game Show Fun'' or learn to ''connect'' in ''Conversations That Matter.'' One flight down from the dance class in Joliet, six women attempt to master the art of decorating cookies; a few doors away a chef teaches other adult students how to make hors d'oeuvres. 
 Critics say such courses divert institutional energy and attention away from the college's essential missions. ''If the community wants adult education, most community colleges say, 'We'll do that.' If the community wants cooking courses, they say, 'We'll do that,' '' says Michael W. Kirst, an emeritus professor of education at Stanford and director of the Bridge Project, a nonprofit organization seeking to get more low-income and minority students to college. ''Before long they get to the point where they now do almost anything and everything a community wants, but none of it very well.'' 
 What he calls ''mission creep,'' Kay McClenney, of the Community College Survey of Student Engagement, calls ''comprehensive mission.'' Continuing ed can be a profit center that supports items shortchanged in public financing, like the library or gym. It's good community politics, too, she says. ''Therefore, you will find community colleges operating wineries and golf courses and doing a whole lot of contractual training for employers,'' she says. ''They end up offering wine-tasting classes and charging a boatload of money for them.'' 
 Thom Price, dean of community and economic development at Joliet, says that the most profitable noncredit offerings are not personal development like ''Salsa Dancing'' but professional development, the work force training requested by local businesses. 
 Ms. McClenney could be thinking of City College of San Francisco's one-day wine workshops, including ''France and Italy vs. California'' ($40) and ''Basics for Beginners'' ($40). Noncredit continuing education contributes more than $350,000 to City's budget each year, says Robert Gabriner, its vice chancellor. 
 Wine tasting makes sense in a wine region, and Excel class makes sense anywhere. But Ms. McClenney draws the line at ''Great Ghost Stories'' and ''Game Show Fun.'' ''There are places where you have to exercise judgment. We shouldn't offer classes in 'How to Bet on Horse Races,' but I know a community college that did.''
 Stacey Jurgens has found a community at her dance classes. ''They just bring people together, and they're a great way to meet new people,'' she said. Did she mean a boyfriend? ''Probably,'' she said, laughing. ''But not as good as church. I have a boyfriend, a musician who loves to dance, and I met him at church.''
 After graduating from high school, Ms. Jurgens went to commercial beauty school. Inspired by her mother, who is now attending Joliet full time to become an X-ray technician, Ms. Jurgens enrolled in an evening class in entrepreneurship. ''It's opened my eyes to the kind of things I could do.'' 
 She could see herself, now, for example, opening a hair salon. COMMUNITY COLLEGE A HARSH REALITY Krystal Jenkins failed and failed and failed math, and then failed again. 
 Math 096 covers a lot in a short time, mostly 9th- and 10th-grade material eight hours a week for six weeks. ''You can't afford to miss a class,'' George McCormack, who teaches it at LaGuardia Community College, in Queens, warned his students as the intersession intensive revved up early last year. ''This is a demanding course, there's no question about it.'' 
 Krystal Jenkins, now 20, knew he was telling the truth. She had already failed remedial math three times with three different teachers, but until she passed basic algebra, she could not take courses in her major.
 Ms. Jenkins has always wanted to be a veterinarian. Even after having a baby as a high school sophomore and settling for a G.E.D., she did not give up on the dream. ''I've always loved animals,'' she said. ''I feel I was put on earth to be a vet, and my daughter is my motivation.'' 
 So she decided on this different approach: a concentrated course. ''If I do not pass,'' she said. ''I probably will stop going to school.'' 
 According to the most recent federal statistics, 42 percent of public community college freshmen take remedial courses. Experts insist the number is vastly higher, because data collection is spotty. At LaGuardia and Joliet Junior College, for example, 80 percent of new students must take at least one catch-up course in math, reading or writing, based on a placement test. At LaGuardia, only about 46 percent make it through in reading, 41 percent in math. Remedial students can take the same course over and over until they pass, get discouraged and quit, or run out of money. 
 LaGuardia offered Ms. Jenkins a chance to fulfill her dream. It will admit anyone with a diploma or equivalent and has a strong program for veterinary technicians, the animal world's equivalent of a nurse. But vet tech is math-heavy. Becoming an actual vet requires a bachelor's degree and four years at a school of veterinary medicine. 
 After a few classes, Ms. Jenkins was feeling confident. She seemed to be doing better, with a 72 on her first big test. ''I'd say it's 90 percent sure that I will pass this time,'' she said. ''I'm very determined to pass the class. That's why I come every morning on time. No matter how tired I am, I still wake up and come to school.'' 
 But she left the midterm exam early, feeling frustrated. ''I really didn't understand the questions and I couldn't really get the answers, so basically I kind of guessed, guessed most of them.'' She said she hadn't been able to study the night before because she was exhausted.
 Nor had she gone to her teacher for help. 
 ''I don't have other time, the extra time to go study, and sit down and review my notes and stuff,'' she said. ''I'm on my feet seven-and-a-half hours a day.'' In addition to doing her job checking groceries, Ms. Jenkins had to travel close to three hours a day -- from home in the Bronx to school to work and back, usually after 10:30 p.m. 
 Like many other community college students, Krystal Jenkins is a full-time parent with a full-time job and a full-time course load. She is close to the edge financially. She shares a small two-bedroom apartment with her parents, her boyfriend, her 4-year-old daughter, a gerbil and a cat. And she is behind academically.
 Kay McClenney, of the Community College Survey of Student Engagement, calls remedial education ''job one'' for two-year colleges. Yet 79 percent of remedial classes are taught by part-time faculty, according to a new study published in Research in Developmental Education. 
 In my visits to remedial classrooms around the country, I saw students wearing headphones, text-messaging and reading nonclass material during class time. On one occasion a class that began with 20 students had only six after the break. Most of the teachers told me they had not been trained to work with at-risk students. They were biology or English majors and, in one case, a college's full-time Webmaster.
 Classrooms like these do not surprise Nancy Shulock, who studies community colleges. A professor at Sacramento State University, she says two-year colleges ''are trying to do remediation on the cheap.'' 
 Her analysis: ''They don't have the money, and they don't have the money because society thinks that it is cheap. It's a circular logic that's not going to get us out of this box.''
 Mike Kirst of Stanford calls for more accountability. ''We don't know exactly how many students they take who could have succeeded with better teaching.'' He cites what economists call the churn model, in which success is unrewarded and failure unpunished. ''As long as the number of students coming in the front equals the number of students dropping out the back door and side door, their enrollment and full-time equivalence is the same, whether they're advancing and graduating or flunking out.'' Because demand is high, he says, ''there is really no incentive to spend a lot of the money to serve these students with special counselors and trained teachers.'' 
 Fewer than half of the remedial classes at LaGuardia are taught by full-time faculty. But Mr. McCormack, Ms. Jenkins's teacher, is full time and trained in remedial education. He earned his doctorate in mathematics education at Teachers College at Columbia University and has been teaching math at LaGuardia for four years. Ms. Jenkins called him the best teacher she had had. He moved easily around Ms. Jenkins's classroom, urging students to ask questions and solve problems. 
 On the day of her final, Krystal Jenkins was nowhere to be found. We discovered her at her apartment that afternoon. She had skipped the exam. ''It all came crashing down,'' she said. ''The whole semester I've been doing so much at one time, and I couldn't deal with it anymore. I just wasn't strong enough to handle it.''
 Mr. McCormack allowed her to take the test several days later. Still she did not pass, though 25 of the 31 students enrolled did well enough to move on. Ms. Jenkins dropped out of LaGuardia. Expecting her second child at the end of May, she now works at an Old Navy store and says she still owes the college $2,035. 
 What happened here? Should Ms. Jenkins have been counseled into making a more realistic career choice? Would a different approach to instruction have made the material stick? 
 Professor Shulock admits the obvious but asks for understanding: ''Community colleges are unprepared to teach the unprepared,'' she says, ''but who is doing it better?''
 LaGuardia, which is part of the City University of New York, won the MetLife Foundation Community College Excellence Award for 2006, for innovative programs for underserved students. It is one of 13 colleges and universities cited as an ''Institution of Excellence'' by the Policy Center on the First Year of College. Among various services, it provides free tutoring at math labs. 
 Gail Mellow, the president, offers this explanation: ''We have lots of innovations but no resources to bring them to scale. If we get half of the students like Krystal through, given our resources, that's amazing.''
 This semester, LaGuardia started a pilot program to try to bring in -- for special tutoring, advising and evaluations -- students who have failed remedial math more than once. Only students who are doing adequately in other courses are being contacted (those with an overall G.P.A. of 2.0 -- 70, all told). 
 The focus is on math, says Cindy Freidmutter, vice president for external and community affairs, because it's an anxiety-producing ''stumbling block.'' Many remedial students have been away from classroom math for some time and need a refresher, she says; others, like Krystal Jenkins with her G.E.D., missed out on years of basic high school math. 
 Ms. Jenkins, who said she had a G.P.A. of 2.9, could have benefited from the new initiative. She said she visited the counseling office two or three times. ''I got a little card telling me I had to come in, so I went in with a list of classes I wanted to take, and they just said O.K.'' Did anyone discuss her plans or ask how she was doing? ''No,'' Ms. Jenkins said, simply.
 ''She did not make it,'' Ms. Mellow says, ''but many do, and they are heroes.'' It's a matter of taking advantage of resources and making time for study. ''Krystal would never be able to make it through remedial math if she couldn't dedicate at least 15 hours a week of work at home.''
 Ms. Mellow says she does not favor interfering with what educators call ''the right to fail.'' LaGuardia caps the number of times a student can take college-level courses at two. But like most community colleges, it does not restrict the number of times a student can take a developmental course. 
 ''Who are we to say a student shouldn't keep on trying?'' Ms. Mellow says. COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE SMART TRANSFER How to graduate from N.Y.U. (or Amherst or Stanford) at half the cost. 
 Reshma Tharani, 21, is part of a new breed of community college student: right out of high school, determined to save money, knowledge able about the ways of the system.
 She expects to graduate next month from New York University, prepared to teach either special education or elementary school. N.Y.U. is one of the nation's most expensive colleges (tuition, room and board come to around $50,000 a year), but she has managed to pay a fraction of that. 
 Her strategy: she lived at home, worked part-time jobs, including telemarketing, and paid less than $2,000 a semester at Nassau Community College on Long Island. 
 I found Ms. Tharani in her classroom at Public School 3 in Greenwich Village, where she is a student teacher. A half-dozen second and third graders were taking turns reading a story. After each one read aloud, she asked questions, trying, she later explained, ''to make sure they were really comprehending what they were reading.'' 
 She had always intended to go to a four-year college but waffled on which one. ''So I decided to go to community college and take care of my prerequisites and get my first degree.'' 
 She took some of her requirements during summer and winter breaks to allow time, she said, to ''take some psychology and math classes I was really interested in'' during the school year. 
 Ms. Tharani's parents came to the United States from India about 40 years ago. They met and married here and now own a wholesale clothing business. Ms. Tharani is the first in her family to attend college. In that, she resembles 39 percent of community college students. Her younger brother goes to Boston College. 
 ''As the tuition has been going up more steeply in four-year institutions, community colleges are an increasingly attractive alternative for savvy kids who want to save money, '' says Prof. Nancy Shulock, of Sacramento State University. ''They know what they need, know how to get it, and don't need a lot of the student services community colleges are struggling to provide students. They can get through in two or three years and transfer.''
 Ms. Tharani saw an academic counselor regularly. ''There were lines, but I always managed to see the same woman,'' she said. She took only courses that the Nassau counselor said N.Y.U. would accept for credit, but, just to be sure, she double-checked with N.Y.U. 
 A favorite professor suggested she apply for a scholarship from the Community College Transfer Opportunity Program, designed to attract transfers from 13 area community colleges to the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development at N.Y.U. Ms. Tharani graduated cum laude from Nassau and won $20,000 a year for her junior and senior years.
 A number of prestigious private institutions encourage transfers. Richard H. Shaw, dean of admissions at Stanford, calls community college transfer applicants mature and interesting candidates. Every year Stanford has 1,400 to 1,600 applicants for about 70 openings in the junior class. This year 26 percent of those accepted came from community colleges, he says. 
 Amherst aggressively recruits community college transfers, says Thomas H. Parker, its dean of admissions and financial aid. The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation provides scholarships of up to $30,000 a year to transfer students. One of this year's 38 recipients is attending Amherst. The foundation is also doling out almost $7 million in grants -- to Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Cornell, the University of Michigan, the University of North Carolina, the University of Southern California and the University of California, Berkeley -- ''to more effectively reach out to high-achieving community college students.'' 
 But access to the high end is not necessarily a shoo-in. In a 2006 report, the Cooke Foundation found that the number of community college students entering the most competitive institutions had declined (from 10.5 percent in 1984 to 5.7 percent in 2002 at private colleges and from 22.2 to 18.8 percent at public ones). 
 Depending on what measures are used, only about 35 percent to 50 percent of potential transfers make it, according to a Department of Education study. A major hurdle is simple confusion. ''A student could be ready to transfer to one institution,'' Ms. Shulock says. ''Then your life circumstances change and you move, only to find that the requirements are different at another college.'' In many states, transferring credits is hit or miss. Unless a two-year college has an articulation agreement that makes a university comfortable with the material covered in its courses, transfer students are not likely to enjoy full credit for their efforts. 
 In California, Ms. Shulock says, ''we do not have one standardized set of courses that a community college student can take and know they are transfer-ready to any of the 23 Cal State campuses or the 10 University of California campuses.'' 
 Where state policy makers have intervened and created incentives, transfer rates are higher. For example, in Florida, students with associate's degrees are automatically admitted to one of the 11 state universities. Apparently, it works: according to David Armstrong, the chancellor of Florida's community colleges, 71 percent of students hoping to transfer actually do; an additional 4 to 6 percent transfer into private or out-of-state colleges. Programs to draw community college transfers have also been developed at the State University of New York, the University of Virginia, the University of California at Davis and the University of Michigan. 
 There is a certain paradox when two-year colleges educate savvy students like Reshma Tharani. If more college-ready students begin their postsecondary careers at community colleges, transfer rates will improve. Community colleges will be doing what they were established to do -- except some of those most in need of the stepladder will be turned away.
 When the number of applicants becomes overwhelming, says George R. Boggs, president of the American Association of Community Colleges, ''the students who register last are turned away, and that's usually first-generation and economically poorer individuals who do not know how to navigate the system.''
 He adds, ''It will be a real test of the will of state policy makers to be sure the doors remain open to those who seek a community college education.'' 
 So how does Ms. Tharani compare her two experiences? ''I had great professors at both places,'' she said, ''but at Nassau I never had any huge classes, where no one knows your name. And when I hear friends talking about all the loans they'll have to pay back, it makes me feel even better about my decision.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Fans, Ballet Scrambles for a Killer App

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
THE New York State Theater was positively surging at a matinee in February. Audience members played clapping games, thumping in their seats like jackhammers. Cheers and shushes erupted when the house lights dimmed. It was the New York City Ballet's annual winter performance for local students, and the energy was wildly different from that of many a sleepy matinee.
 Warren Betha, a student from Fort Lee High School in New Jersey who takes a variety of dance classes, said after the show that he could see connections between many techniques, but that in the end he preferred hip-hop because ''it's more alive.''
That is a verdict guaranteed to make fine arts marketing directors everywhere wince. Ballet, like opera and classical music, has a serious image problem in America, and companies are increasingly trying to combat it and attract new, younger viewers. 
 This struggle has even reached the gates of the vaunted City Ballet. When the company opens its spring season on Tuesday, what happens onstage will be business as usual, but the packaging will be anything but, as City Ballet broadens the experiment with thematic programming that it began during the winter. 
 Viewers may choose individual nights like ''International Balanchine'' or series like ''Girls' Night Out,'' which includes desserts and ''girl talk'' with ballerinas and has caused much eye-rolling among balletomanes. 
 ''The big concern that everyone has is that you also don't want to alienate your core audience, which has been coming for 40 years,'' said Peter Martins, the company's ballet master in chief. The jury is still out on the new system, he added, ''but not to do it, not to do anything, would be complacent.''
 City Ballet can ill afford complacency. The company reports that from 2001 to 2006 the percentage of seats sold by subscription dropped to 50 from 60, corresponding to a rise in single-ticket sales, to 50 percent from 40. It also reports that those who have been watching City Ballet for more than 20 years attend an average of 2.8 shows each season, but new audience members average only 1.6 performances. The core audience, which grew up during what Christopher Wheeldon, City Ballet's resident choreographer, describes as the golden years of the company and of George Balanchine's productivity, will not be the core for much longer.
 ''We've been in rather safe territory for a while, where that slice of audience is still very supportive of the ballet,'' said Mr. Wheeldon, who concludes his residency next year. ''If you look at the number of older people at the ballet, it makes you realize that that sort of support system is perhaps going to start dwindling fairly soon.''
 As institutions like City Ballet tinker with existing models, Mr. Wheeldon and others envision more radical changes.
 Damian Woetzel, a principal dancer at City Ballet who is earning a master's degree in public administration at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, foresees what he calls ''a day of reckoning coming very soon, when an entire generation will look at what we see as the culmination of culture and say, 'That doesn't work for us.' '' Finding what does work will take ''new generations to start influencing,'' he said, ''and to offend, in some cases.'' 
 Mr. Wheeldon is perhaps ballet's biggest offender. At 33, he is the closest thing it has to Alex Rodriguez, the hyperscrutinized Yankee slugger held to the highest expectations. But A-Rod need power only one team to a ring. Mr. Wheeldon is heralded as an entire era's answer to Balanchine: a singular choreographic voice who will catapult ballet out of its creative doldrums, making it culturally vital for a new generation.
 Understandably leery of being crowned what he calls ''the balletic messiah,'' Mr. Wheeldon is still taking up the challenge. Morphoses/ The Wheeldon Company, which he founded in collaboration with the former City Ballet dancer Lourdes Lopez, will make its debut in August at the Vail International Dance Festival in Colorado, where Mr. Woetzel became artistic director last year. The mission of Morphoses, as stated on its Web site, morphoses.org, is to ''restore ballet as a force of innovation,'' and Mr. Wheeldon and Ms. Lopez have both expressed interest in drawing younger audiences, even at the risk of alienating longtime fans.
 ''You want your audience to be as vibrant as the work that's being presented to them,'' Mr. Wheeldon said. ''They're a part of the experience.'' Mr. Wheeldon says he has tired of the traditional proscenium boundary between viewers and performers, which creates a feeling of ''them and us.'' Tellingly, Morphoses' first evening at Vail will feature a preview and a reception, not a premiere.
 Companies are increasingly playing with that boundary. The Sacramento Ballet has introduced ''Beer & Ballet'' showings: for $25 viewers can sample works by resident dancers and receive a free beverage (beer, wine, soda or water). City Ballet's Web site tragiclovenyc.com -- dedicated to what is being billed as Mr. Martins's ''contemporary look'' at ''Romeo and Juliet'' -- features ''Behind the Curtain'' videos exploring the many elements that are going into the production. (In a first for City Ballet, the company is holding an open dress rehearsal of the ballet next Sunday night.) American Ballet Theater runs an ''18 to 29 Club,'' intended to bring in younger audiences and has begun a program with Payless Shoes to offer Ballet Theater shoes and accessories through the chain.
 Others see these efforts as mere window dressing, distractions from a deeper disconnect between ballet and American culture. 
 ''I've had a long interest in what it means to be a creative entity in an American democracy, especially when your historical vocabulary traditionally is from a European plutocracy or monarchy or however you want to say it,'' said Dorothy Gunther Pugh, the founder of Ballet Memphis. ''The whole rapid change of culture in America is going to leave these European art forms behind, and that's O.K., I guess. What we need to do is hear what the culture is saying and reflect what it is that we see, and not just what we learned inside a studio because someone told us it's very important we have straight knees and an arched foot.''
 Ms. Pugh's troupe, now 20 years old, looks to be thriving artistically, if its debut at the Joyce Theater this month was any indication. But regional companies face a daunting economic reality. In recent years several troupes in midsize cities have folded or cut back; Ballet Memphis has gone from 24 dancers to 14 in the last three years. This year Ms. Pugh received a $60,000 grant from the Mellon Foundation to explore the mounting operational challenges and the cultural standing of ballet companies in 21st-century America. She plans to use her findings to turn Ballet Memphis into a sort of pilot company.
 ''It's not just about how do we market in this changing world,'' Ms. Pugh said. ''It's who are we going to be in this changing world?''
 Answers are urgently needed as box office and marketing pressures increasingly lead artistic directors to produce cheesy ''updates'' of classic story ballets, half-baked fusion attempts and awkward ad campaigns. Is ballet, in the rush to attract what Mr. Woetzel laughingly called ''this mythical young audience,'' compromising the very qualities that distinguish it?
 Regional companies are ''confronted with a system where they need to sell tickets,'' said Luca Veggetti, an Italian choreographer who often works in America. ''Otherwise they are gone.''
 ''You have companies saying, 'We have to do Peter Pan and Dracula,' '' he added, laughing. ''What is the point? You're not like a TV program. You're supposed to raise the cultural level of your audience. I have a lot of discussions about this, especially with regional companies. They often say, 'Yes, we have to do this, even though we know it's terrible.' And I say, 'Why are you there, then?' ''
 Mr. Veggetti acknowledged that he might be too idealistic. But a number of choreographers and dancers expressed similar views, stressing the need for more education -- for the public, certainly, but also in the ballet studio, where some feel there should be more history lessons along with the technique -- about the importance of ballet to the culture as the only meaningful way to revitalize it. 
 This credibility gap contributes to suspicions about motivations, which often raise as many hackles as what is actually on stage. 
 ''First of all who are you attracting? The 57-year-old fathers of the girls who go to see 'The Nutcracker'?'' asked the choreographer Mark Morris, referring to American Ballet Theater's much-mocked 2002 ballet ''Within You Without You: A Tribute to George Harrison.'' ''What is this about? If it were done out of an appreciation for Mr. Harrison's music, that's one thing. But I don't think that it was.''
 Though Ballet Theater's artistic director Kevin McKenzie said creating something ''that resonates with people'' is never a bad thing, he dismissed the notion of pandering. ''It's always easy to criticize someone's motivations. I think it's more to the point to criticize the results.''
 Responding to criticism of enhanced series like ''Girls' Night Out,'' Mr. Martins said he didn't see anything wrong with a little enticement. His warning that an art form can become ''higher than thou'' and disaffect the public was echoed by several company members. ''Sometimes people take things a little too seriously,'' said Melissa Barak, a dancer and choreographer who just left City Ballet for the newly founded Los Angeles Ballet.
 For others, ballet is not taken seriously enough.
 ''Ballet as a culture could use more self-reflection and really look at itself, critiquing these environments that surround the creation of these steps,'' said Emily Coates, a City Ballet alumna who is now the artistic director of the World Performance Project at Yale University, where she earned her bachelor's degree last year. ''I think that the environment itself tends to be out of step with the rest of the world in 2007.''
 At the same time, she added, ''dance and the performing arts need to be brought in as a crucial component of a well-rounded liberal education, and not as an entertaining reward to the 'hard stuff,' like calculus.''
 Audiences are not stupid, she said: ''I don't think that they need more packaging. I think that they need context.''
 Context is what City Ballet suggests its thematic programming offers, and that may be. But what caliber of context, and for whom? It's a question Mr. Martins and his peers will probably be wrestling with for some time to come.

HEADLINE: IN TURNABOUT, INFANT DEATHS CLIMB IN SOUTH

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: HOLLANDALE, Miss. 

 BODY:
For decades, Mississippi and neighboring states with large black populations and expanses of enduring poverty made steady progress in reducing infant death. But, in what health experts call an ominous portent, progress has stalled and in recent years the death rate has risen in Mississippi and several other states. 
 The setbacks have raised questions about the impact of cuts in welfare and Medicaid and of poor access to doctors, and, many doctors say, the growing epidemics of obesity, diabetes and hypertension among potential mothers, some of whom tip the scales here at 300 to 400 pounds.
''I don't think the rise is a fluke, and it's a disturbing trend, not only in Mississippi but throughout the Southeast,'' said Dr. Christina Glick, a neonatologist in Jackson, Miss., and past president of the National Perinatal Association. 
 To the shock of Mississippi officials, who in 2004 had seen the infant mortality rate -- defined as deaths by the age of 1 year per thousand live births -- fall to 9.7, the rate jumped sharply in 2005, to 11.4. The national average in 2003, the last year for which data have been compiled, was 6.9. Smaller rises also occurred in 2005 in Alabama, North Carolina and Tennessee. Louisiana and South Carolina saw rises in 2004 and have not yet reported on 2005. 
 Whether the rises continue or not, federal officials say, rates have stagnated in the Deep South at levels well above the national average. 
 Most striking, here and throughout the country, is the large racial disparity. In Mississippi, infant deaths among blacks rose to 17 per thousand births in 2005 from 14.2 per thousand in 2004, while those among whites rose to 6.6 per thousand from 6.1. (The national average in 2003 was 5.7 for whites and 14.0 for blacks.) 
 The overall jump in Mississippi meant that 65 more babies died in 2005 than in the previous year, for a total of 481. 
 The toll is visible in Hollandale, a tired town in the impoverished Delta region of northwest Mississippi. 
 Jamekia Brown, 22 and two months pregnant with her third child, lives next to the black people's cemetery in the part of town called No Name, where multiple generations crowd into cheap clapboard houses and trailers. 
 So it took only a minute to walk to the graves of Ms. Brown's first two children, marked with temporary metal signs because she cannot afford tombstones. 
 Her son, who was born with deformities in 2002, died in her arms a few months later, after surgery. Her daughter was stillborn the next year. Nearby is another green marker, for a son of Ms. Brown's cousin who died at four months, apparently of pneumonia. 
 The main causes of infant death in poor Southern regions included premature and low-weight births; Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, which is linked to parental smoking and unsafe sleeping positions as well as unknown causes; congenital defects; and, among poor black teenage mothers in particular, deaths from accidents and disease.
 Dr. William Langston, an obstetrician at the Mississippi Department of Health, said in a telephone interview that officials could not yet explain the sudden increase and were investigating. Dr. Langston said the state was working to extend prenatal care and was experimenting with new outreach programs. But, he added, ''programs take money, and Mississippi is the poorest state in the nation.''
 Doctors who treat poor women say they are not surprised by the reversal. 
 ''I think the rise is real, and it's going to get worse,'' said Dr. Bouldin Marley, an obstetrician at a private clinic in Clarksdale since 1979. ''The mothers in general, black or white, are not as healthy,'' Dr. Marley said, calling obesity and its complications a main culprit.
 Obesity makes it more difficult to do diagnostic tests like ultrasounds and can lead to hypertension and diabetes, which can cause the fetus to be undernourished, he said. 
 Another major problem, Dr. Marley said, is that some women arrive in labor having had little or no prenatal care. ''I don't think there's a lack of providers or facilities,'' he said. ''Some women just don't have the get up and go.'' 
 But social workers say that the motivation of poor women is not so simply described, and it can be affected by cuts in social programs and a dearth of transportation as well as low self esteem. 
 ''If you didn't have a car and had to go 60 miles to see a doctor, would you go very often?'' said Ramona Beardain, director of Delta Health Partners. The group runs a federally financed program, Healthy Start, that sends social workers and nurses to counsel pregnant teenagers and new mothers in seven counties of the Delta. ''If they're in school they miss the day; if they're working they don't get paid,'' Ms. Berdain said.
 Poverty has climbed in Mississippi in recent years, and things are tougher in other ways for poor women, with cuts in cash welfare and changes in the medical safety net. 
 In 2004, Gov. Haley Barbour came to office promising not to raise taxes and to cut Medicaid. Face-to-face meetings were required for annual re-enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, the children's health insurance program; locations and hours for enrollment changed, and documentation requirements became more stringent. 
 As a result, the number of non-elderly people, mainly children, covered by the Medicaid and CHIP programs declined by 54,000 in the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years. According to the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program in Jackson, some eligible pregnant women were deterred by the new procedures from enrolling. 
 One former Medicaid official, Maria Morris, who resigned last year as head of an office that informed the public about eligibility, said that under the Barbour administration, her program was severely curtailed. 
 ''The philosophy was to reduce the rolls and our activities were contrary to that policy,'' she said. 
 Mississippi's Medicaid director, Dr. Robert L. Robinson, said in a written response that suggesting any correlation between the decline in Medicaid enrollment and infant mortality was ''pure conjecture.''
 Dr. Robinson said that the new procedures eliminated unqualified recipients. With 95 enrollment sites available, he said, no one should have had difficulty signing up. 
 As to Ms. Morris's charge that information efforts had been curbed, Dr. Robinson said that because of the frequent turnover of Medicaid directors -- he is the sixth since 2000 -- ''our unified outreach program was interrupted.'' He said it has now resumed. 
 The state Health Department has cut back its system of clinics, in part because of budget shortfalls and a shortage of nurses. Some clinics that used to be open several days a week are now open once a week and some offer no prenatal care. 
 The department has also suffered management turmoil and reductions in field staff, problems so severe that the state Legislature recently voted to replace the director. 
 Oleta Fitzgerald, southern regional director for the Children's Defense Fund, said: ''When you see drops in the welfare rolls, when you see drops in Medicaid and children's insurance, you see a recipe for disaster. Somebody's not eating, somebody's not going to the doctor and unborn children suffer.'' 
 Visits with pregnant women and mothers in several Delta towns suggest that many poverty-related factors -- including public policies, personal behaviors and health conditions -- may contribute to infant deaths. 
 Krystal Allen, a cousin of Jamekia Brown's, was 17 when she had her first baby. When he was 4 months old, she said, he developed breathing problems. Ms. Allen took the child to an emergency room, where he was put on a vaporizer and given an antibiotic and a prescription and they were sent home, where they slept for a few hours. 
 ''When I woke up I thought he was sleeping, and I was getting ready for church,'' Ms. Allen said. ''But he was dead.'' 
 Now 21, a mother of two with a third on the way, Ms. Allen lives in a sparsely furnished house in Hollandale with her unemployed boyfriend and his mother. Her children live with her parents. 
 Ms. Allen greeted visitors with breakfast in hand: a bottle of Mountain Dew and a bag of chips. 
 Janice Johnson, a social worker with Delta Health Partners, urged her to eat more healthily. ''I'm going to change my diet one day,'' Ms. Allen replied. 
 She had been to a doctor for one visit but had to sign up for Medicaid to get continued care. That required a 36-mile trip to an office in Greenville. 
 ''Can't you go this Friday?'' Ms. Johnson asked. 
 ''Well, if my mom is going to Greenville,'' Ms. Allen replied, ''and if she has gas in the car.'' 
 As for Ms. Brown, having lost two babies and suffering from thyroid disease and hypertension, her latest pregnancy is considered high risk. Ms. Johnson has helped arrange for intensive medical monitoring.
 Eunice Brown, 21, another of Ms. Johnson's clients, was fortunate nothing went wrong with her first pregnancy. She was afraid to tell her mother. In the eighth month of her pregnancy, she went to the hospital with a stomach ache and delivered a healthy baby. 
 ''I was 15 and I didn't think prenatal care mattered that much,'' she said in the one-bedroom home she shares with her mother, her three children and two nieces her mother is tending. Ms. Brown, who was three months' pregnant with her fourth child, said she would apply for Medicaid ''when I get the transportation.'' The family has lived mainly off her welfare checks and her intermittent work, in elderly day care, which led her welfare check to be reduced from $194 a month to $26 a month. A father ''sometimes helps with money,'' she said. 
 In the past 10 years, the infant mortality rate for blacks in most of the Delta has averaged about 14 per thousand in some counties and more than 20 per thousand in others. But just to the south of Hollandale, Sharkey County, one of the poorest, has had a startlingly different record. From 1991 through 2005, the rate for blacks hovered at around 5 per thousand. 
 State officials say the county's population is too small -- it registers only 100 births a year -- to be statistically significant. But many experts feel it is no coincidence that a steep drop in infant deaths followed the start of an intensive home-visiting system run by the Cary Christian Center, using local mothers as counselors. 
 ''If this is a fluke it's a 15-year fluke,'' said Dr. Glick, the neonatologist. 
 The program, which is paid for with private money, buses nearly all pregnant blacks in Sharkey and a small neighboring county to pre- and postnatal classes. 
 Irma Johnson, who has worked for the Cary Center for 14 years, was a soothing presence as she visited Erica Moore, a 24-year-old with young twins. With Vaseline, warm water, a toothbrush and soft murmurs, she showed her how to combat cradle cap, a scaly buildup on the scalp. 
 But personal attention cannot always change ingrained attitudes. 
 Barbara Williams, another veteran counselor of the Cary center, made an unannounced visit to a cluster of trailers in Anguilla occupied by the extended Jackson family. 
 ''I've been following this family for 18 years, and they're in a bad cycle,'' Ms. Williams said, noting that three generations of women had dropped out of high school. 
 As Ms. Williams entered one crowded trailer a young woman tried to hide, then stood defiantly. The woman, Victoria Jackson, 22, already has three small children and was five months pregnant. 
 No, she said, she has not signed up for Medicaid and she has not seen a doctor, and she brushed aside offers of help. 
 Ms. Williams, visibly upset, said later, ''Victoria never gives a reason why she doesn't see a doctor. I guess she thinks she's gotten away with it three times already.''

A front-page article on Sunday about an increase in the infant death rate in some Southern states misstated the given name of an obstetrician at the Mississippi Department of Health who said officials could not yet explain the rise in the rate in that state. He is Dr. LeDon Langston, not William.

HEADLINE: Fine Art, Shabby Package? Not in This State, Please

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
TIME was, a dim, cramped room was a perfectly fine place to appreciate the beauty of a Great Master's oil painting. Now, though, there's a growing expectation that the packaging -- as in the buildings that house the galleries -- should be on par artistically with its contents, according to museum directors, business analysts and architects.
 As a result, the state's museums have become larger, cleaner and more stylish -- an emphasis that signals more fundamental economic changes to come. 
''Connecticut's no longer an insurance capital or a place where guns are manufactured,'' said William N. Goetzmann, a professor at the Yale School of Management who lectures on business and art and who was the director of the Museum of Western Art in Denver in the 1980s. ''So, we're looking to history and culture to define the state.''
 The $44 million restoration of the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, to better honor Louis I. Kahn's original design, is probably the state's most talked-about upgrade. Yet other renovations are equally ambitious, as in Hartford, where the Wadsworth Atheneum recently announced plans to take over the former home of The Hartford Times, which it has leased from the city. 
 The neoclassical terra cotta 1920 building, whose facade features six tall columns, looms on Prospect Street, across the street from the Atheneum's current facility.
 Conversion of the now-empty building, which will begin in the late spring, will cost $15 million, said David Baxter, project director, who added that it is the museum's first expansion since 1969.
 When completed in the fall of 2008, the museum will have added 54,000 square feet, Mr. Baxter said. ''It's a fantastic opportunity that allows us to smartly address our most pressing need -- space,'' he said.
 Putting more people on the streets could also spur the neighborhood's continuing revitalization, an ancillary benefit realized by other midsize cities that are increasingly using museums as tools for urban revival, city leaders said.
 Since the New Britain Museum of American Art opened a 43,000-square-foot wing a year ago, attendance has more than doubled, with 70,000 people coming to admire its collection, which includes many Hudson River School paintings, said Paula Bender, a spokeswoman.
 Earlier this month, a complex of classrooms, studios and a library opened in the museum's former galleries, a 23,000-square-foot former mansion next door.
 ''The changes are opening up the museum to a whole new group of people, and they're stopping here for lunch or dinner,'' said Donald A. Courtemanche, director of the New Britain Downtown District, which has worked to attract tourists since 1983.
 In the past, not-for-profit building booms were tied to Wall Street booms, and now, with state and federal funds all but dried up, banking money is footing an even greater share of the bills, museum directors said.
 To finance an imminent addition to its facility, Greenwich's Bruce Museum, for example, is likely to hit up the numerous hedge-fund firms located just blocks away, said its executive director, Peter C. Sutton. 
 Although the museum measures 28,000 square feet, only about a quarter of that contains galleries, and with 100,000 visitors a year, those rooms can get crowded, Mr. Sutton said.
 When the time comes to raise funds for the multimillion-dollar project, Mr. Sutton is confident the community support will be there.
 ''Opera, ballet and symphonies may be struggling,'' he said, ''but museums seem to be holding their own.''

HEADLINE: Of Buying and Flying Those Pilotless Planes

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Pilotless Plane that Only Looks Like Child's Play'' (April 15), about unmanned aerial vehicles used by the military: 
 The Air Force is not desiring to ''control the deployment of unmanned airplanes,'' as the article said, but is recommending that it be designated the Department of Defense executive agent to oversee the purchasing process for medium- and high-altitude U.A.V.'s. The associated authority would let the Air Force standardize and streamline U.A.V. purchasing to produce substantial cost savings benefiting all the military services.
 As executive agent, the Air Force would merge duplicative programs, increasing economies of scale, and enhance how U.A.V.'s work together for all the services. Separate from the issue of executive agency, the Air Force advocates that medium- and high-altitude U.A.V.'s be controlled jointly. The result would be that intelligence from U.A.V.'s would be distributed to the greatest number of troops on the ground, sea and in the air. Lt. Gen. David Deptula Arlington, Va., April 18 The writer is the deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, Department of the Air Force.

HEADLINE: Danube (Both Sides) on Hudson

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
ROMANIA and Bulgaria joined the European Union in January, so in the long run, there may be less economic incentive for their residents to emigrate to New York. Luckily for lovers of mititei and shopska salad, plenty of them are already here. 
 About 22,000 Romanian and 4,000 Bulgarian immigrants live in New York, according to the Department of City Planning. And for those who want to know what the European Union gained without traveling to Europe, the next month is a great time to come to New York: with festivals and concerts, it's a virtual Danube-visits-the-Hudson.
First, food. The Bulgarians may claim to have invented yogurt, but unless you count the Dannon and Yoplait shelves at the supermarket, there are more places in New York to eat Romanian. They're concentrated in Sunnyside, Queens, a short subway ride from Grand Central or Times Square on the No. 7 line. Peter Meehan, a Times restaurant critic, recommends Acasa, where he liked the caviar spread and a dessert translated as ''Fried Cheese Donuts with sweet vanilla creamy sauce.'' He also sampled the seltzer-in-your-wine tradition that some Romanians love and others consider a national embarrassment. 
 At other spots, like Casa Romana and Harmony 2, you can try the mititei, often translated as Romanian sausage but closer to a grilled mini-meatloaf made with ground pork, ground beef and spices. Served with standard-issue mustard, it can seem a bit of a plain Jane, but smile and tell the Romanians you love it. There's also stuffed cabbage with polenta, and genuinely lovable dips and pastes made from eggplant and beans. 
 Be prepared for the decor, which can topple hopelessly over the kitsch cliff. Among the topplers: Casa Romana, with its disco ball, fake plants and textured ceiling that looks like an upside-down lemon-meringue pie. On weekend nights, there is live entertainment. Gigi Marga, the octogenarian singer and former Romanian celebrity, often takes the stage, causing double-takes among those who used to love her when she (and they) lived back home.
 Harmony 2 is more refined: white tablecloths and attentive service buffer the chandeliers and the banquet-hall feel. The skylights make it especially nice for lunch, as does its proximity to Nita European Bakery. This bakery is no pain au chocolat and cannoli spot, though. There is amandina, a chocolate cake with almond flavoring, and savarina, a cake soaked in rum syrup. A sweet bread known as cozonac comes in flavors like chocolate and Turkish delight. 
 You can skip the trip to Queens if you come the weekend of May 5: that's the eighth annual Romanian Day Festival, on a half-mile stretch of Water Street downtown. You'll find all the food there, along with regional costumes of Moldavia (not to be confused with the neighboring country of Moldova), Transylvania (the region, not the vampire lair) and others. If you happen to be stuck in Bucharest and can't make it to New York for the festival, you can catch it live on Romanian television.
 But enough of Romania. There are two legit Bulgarian spots in town, including the Bulgarian Bar, a k a the Bulgarian Disco, a k a Mehanata, a k a ''that crazy Bulgarian place at Canal and Broadway.'' It reopened last year in a hipper spot, on the Lower East Side, but some Bulgarians say they remember when a performer at its old, weird Canal and Broadway spot in Chinatown once made the papers back home for having ''debuted on Broadway.'' There are two floors: an upstairs bar and restaurant, with a stress on the bar (you have to ask for the food menu), and a downstairs disco where the Slavic beat goes on. 
 But if you just want to eat, you're better off at Bulgara, an island of charm in industrial Long Island City. The shopska salad, with its creamy Bulgarian feta topping a mix of cucumbers and tomatoes, is on almost every table (and the feta-and-cottage-cheese-stuffed fried peppers should be). Main courses come off the grill; the drink of choice is rakia, a Bulgarian brandy.
 Bulgarian music sometimes gets going at 9 or 10 p.m., and though the trend toward pop-folk may not be sophisticated (note the scanty outfits and only slightly less scanty singing talent) but people get up and dance, in couples or in a long line with the singer in front. If you do well at Greek or Jewish weddings, with a few rakias you should be able to fake the Bulgarian steps, too. 
 The Bulgarian Film Festival wraps up next Friday at the Scandinavian House (sorry, no Swedish subtitles), and next Sunday there is the Bulgarian Virtuosi Chamber Orchestra concert in Weill Hall at Carnegie Hall. The Bulgarian Concert Evenings in New York series offers concerts free to the public (on weekdays); the next one is ''Schubertiada'' on May 9 at the Bulgarian Consulate. And at Weill Hall, ''Musical Treasures from Bulgaria'' can be heard on May 22. 
 Starting May 1, you can also study Bulgaria through non-Bulgarian eyes at the Jadite Gallery, whose assistant director is Bulgarian. Eleanor Gilpatrick, an American painter, will be taking over the three-room space, and the largest room will be devoted to her landscapes of Bulgaria, where she traveled last year, so you don't have to.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths DANTZKER, MORRIS ''DAN'' DAN DANTZKER

 BODY:
 DANTZKER--Morris ''Dan'' Dan Dantzker died on April 12, 2007. A resident of San Francisco since 1986, Dan's roots remained in Washington, D.C. and New York City, where he was born 92 years ago. He was the only one of four children of immigrant parents from Luboml, Ukraine born in the United States. Dan survived his wife Mary by six years and is survived by three children and five grandchildren. With a lifelong commitment to education and learning, Dan graduated from the College of the City of New York with a B.S. in Chemistry in 1934. A course in logic at CCNY significantly influenced Dans thinking and work throughout his professional life. 
Grateful to CCNY for providing an outstanding, free education, Dan supported the College throughout his life. With the support of the U.S. Army, Dan obtained an M.B.A. from Ohio State University in 1955. He also attended the US Army Command and General Staff College in 1959 and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in 1963. Dan was inducted into the U.S. Army in 1941 and commissioned a second lieutenant in the Adjutant General Corps in 1942. During World War II, he served in Manila and Korea, and de-mobilized in 1946. He re-joined the Regular Army in 1947. In a 25-year military career, primarily in computer technology, he was awarded the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Korea Defense Service Medal and the Commendation Medal. In his last tour, Dan was Special Assistant to the Army Chief of Staff for Army Information and Data Systems before retiring as a Colonel in 1967. Dan's background in logic and information systems led him in 1969 to a second career with Con Edison of New York, where he eventually became Executive Vice President. He was part of a new management team brought in to assist the company refocus on customer service and system reliability. He led a team in the successful development and deployment of one of the country's first computer data base customer information retrieval systems, which would allow a service representative to see a customer's records on a computer screen while talking to the customer. Commonplace now, such systems were at the outer edge of information technology at the time. Dan's focus on customer service operations and the reliability of power distribution systems led to a substantial reduction in complaints and to system wide improvements that helped all employees deliver better service to the ratepayers. He remained committed his entire life to a company that he knew affected the lives of millions of residents every day and that was critical to the economic sustainability of the city he loved. Dan retired from Con Edison in 1980 and became President of the Economic Development Council of New York City, Inc. where he coordinated efforts of business, labor and government to improve the economic development environment of New York City. He then went on to consulting career for utilities nationwide, before finally retiring in 1990. A life long student of space, astronomy and the physical world, Dan was a voracious reader. At age 90 he read On The Origin of Species, taking notes as he went. He was a supporter of smaller or less is better long before environmental impacts would be widely understood. For Dan, education never ended and he supported his children and grandchildren generously in their own schooling. He also completed the New York Times crossword puzzle every day for the last 30 years. His family deeply mourns his passing, and will keep his adage that it is always better to share close to our hearts. A service and burial will take place in Arlington National Cemetery on June 13, 2007 at 9:00 am.

HEADLINE: Where Russians Still Think Boldly

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
CHUKOTKA is at the edge of the earth, one of Russia's most remote and impoverished regions, a frozen expanse bigger than Texas, with a population that could fit in the Astrodome.
 Like much of Russia's Far North, the vast arc of tundra and permafrost above the Arctic Circle, it has captured the imaginations of czars and general secretaries and now a new generation of leaders. For centuries they have aspired to conquer its unforgiving isolation, often with schemes that defy the imagination.
The latest such scheme emerged last week with a proposal to link Chukotka to Alaska by building a 63-mile tunnel under the icy waters of the Bering Strait -- a man-made rejoining of the two continents. Pointing out that the tunnel would essentially begin and end nowhere (Chukotka has few roads, let alone railroads) misses the essential point of the Arctic's place in the Russian soul. 
 It is a place of explorers, adventurers and survivors, of endurance, tradition and ambition. The tunnel idea evoked the grand designs the Soviet Union crafted to unlock the natural resources of Siberia by decree and, in the beginning at least, with the subjugated labor of the gulag.
 That legacy, clearly, lives on, but other, less pie-in-the-ice ideas are incubating in Chukotka. The World Wildlife Fund has created a project with native Chukchi hunters to protect the region's polar bears, now endangered by the threats of a changing climate and rampant poaching. 
 In Vankarem, a tiny coastal village on the Chukchi Sea, hunters established a ''bear patrol'' last year with the intent of keeping a safe distance between villagers and the growing number of bears that come ashore as they migrate in search of their preferred environs, floating sea ice.
 ''We would like to have every village on the migration route be involved,'' said Sergei I. Kavry, the patrol's leader, who dreams of reviving native cultural traditions that all but died under Soviet rule.
 It is an increasingly rare instance of Russian civic political organization -- in the Siberia of exile, no less. Such activism is viewed with increasing suspicion in Vladimir V. Putin's realm. Perhaps given Chukotka's location, nine time zones east of Moscow, the Kremlin's heavy hand seems a distant thing.
 No less ambitious has been the effort of Chukotka's governor, Roman A. Abramovich, to lift the region out of the poverty and desolation it found itself in after the Soviet Union collapsed in the 1990s.
 He is Russia's richest man, an oil tycoon turned investor who owns the Chelsea Football Club in London (where he clearly prefers to live). Since being elected governor in 2000 and reappointed by Mr. Putin in 2005, he has revived the region -- in large part with money raised by the personal income tax he pays there and two charities he has created. He has largely rebuilt Chukotka's homes and hospitals.
 Next up is the economy, which is still dependent on government subsidies for fuel, food and jobs because the harsh winters and only slightly less harsh summers make life in Chukotka virtually unsustainable.
 ''The governor has a goal of making Chukotka self-sufficient within the next few years,'' his American spokesman, John A. Mann, said. ''To do that, you have to develop natural resources and bring in investments. It is not the easiest thing to do.''
 Certainly not. During the cold war, Chukotka was a closed border zone, bristling with military installations that are now abandoned lots filled with the rusting detritus of Soviet power. Government permission is still required before a visit, but the Arctic beckons and is, slowly, opening itself to the possibilities of a new Russia.
 In the middle of an overland journey across Chukotka's windswept snow and ice, two all-terrain track vehicles carrying the World Wildlife Fund's researchers to Vankarem encountered a convoy of snowmobiles headed north. Riding them were entrepreneurs with another notion: extreme tourism. 

GRAPHIC: Photos: Snowfield Dreams -- In Russia, distance from the Kremlin seems to grow the imagination. Nine time zones away, in the far distant Arctic, officials and entrepreneurs dream of rail lines, pipelines, even an intercontinental tunnel to Alaska. What's there now? Some villages and a lot of snow
 also bear hunters, above left, and their sled dogs, and a village elder, below, in Vankarem who recounted unregulated polar bear hunts in his youth. And visions of a bold new economy to attract intrepid new neighbors. If you build it, in other words, someone will come.

HEADLINE: Shifting Tone on Immigration, Candidate Giuliani Talks Tough

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA and SAM ROBERTS; Marc Santora reported from Des Moines, and Sam Roberts from New York.

DATELINE: DES MOINES, April 16 

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani is a long way from Ellis Island.
 A decade ago, as mayor of New York, Mr. Giuliani used that historic backdrop to champion the cause of immigrants, calling attacks on people who came here legally a blow to ''the heart and soul of America.'' And from City Hall he often defended illegal immigrants, ordering city workers not to deny them benefits and advocating measures to ease their path to citizenship.
But now he is running for president, and the politics of immigration in the post-9/11 world is vastly different, with the issue splitting the Republican Party and voters peppering Mr. Giuliani on the campaign trail with questions about his current thinking. Perhaps more than any other candidate, Mr. Giuliani has a record on immigration with the potential to complicate his bid for the nomination.
 In contrast to his years as mayor, when he fought federal efforts to curtail public hospital or educational services to illegal immigrants, he now talks of penalties for people here illegally and requirements for them to wait at the back of the line. And while he once pushed policies like providing schooling for the children of illegal immigrants by saying, ''The reality is that they are here, and they're going to remain here,'' now he emphasizes denying amnesty. 
 In the 1990s, Mr. Giuliani saw the city's great number of immigrants as integral to the work force and a politically potent key to the resurgence of a struggling New York. Now, his aides say that his basic thinking has not changed, but that his emphasis has shifted to reflect the times. 
 ''Immigration reform has to begin with border security because we are a nation at war,'' said Anthony V. Carbonetti, a senior political adviser who has worked with Mr. Giuliani for 15 years. ''He is still very proud that people want to come to this country.''
 For now, Mr. Giuliani is relying on his reputation as a law-and-order mayor to convince voters that he will crack down on illegal immigration. He also sprinkles his comments with nods to his past statements, saying he would welcome immigrants willing to learn the language, respect the culture and follow the law. 
 As he campaigned across the country in recent weeks, Mr. Giuliani, whose grandparents came from Italy, never brought up the subject of immigration unprompted, but voters have kept the issue before him. In his first extensive town hall meeting here in Iowa last Saturday, he was asked twice about his views. And other Republican candidates are also pressing the issue.
 At the annual Lincoln Day dinner here last Saturday, Representative Tom Tancredo, Republican of Colorado, received some of the loudest applause from the 1,000 party loyalists in attendance as he railed against illegal immigrants.
 ''We are destroying the concept of citizenship itself,'' Mr. Tancredo said. ''America, and indeed Western civilization, are in a crisis.''
 Without mentioning him by name, he took Mr. Giuliani to task for past policies that have ''encouraged more illegals to cross our borders.''
 When Mr. Giuliani was asked to clarify his views on immigration at the town meeting, he emphasized enforcing the law but stayed away from any kind of blanket condemnation of illegal immigrants.
 Mr. Giuliani's approach is similar to the one proposed by President Bush, advocating an orderly flow of immigrants by providing a clear path to citizenship and thereby easing the pressure at the border.
 Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Giuliani emphasizes the need for tough border controls. He said he wanted to help those who are already in America become citizens, but he is quick to highlight that he is not in favor of amnesty, which leading Republican candidates dare not endorse.
 ''First thing is, there should be no amnesty,'' Mr. Giuliani said in response to a reporter's question in Atlanta recently. Amnesty means varying things to various candidates. For Mr. Giuliani, it means no blanket forgiveness of illegal status.
 Immigration has been a difficult issue for all the major Republican candidates, and they have responded to it in notably different ways.
 Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, was the only one of the three leading Republican contenders to mention the issue at the Lincoln Day dinner, pressing an increasingly restrictive view.
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who until recently joined Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, in pushing for a compromise in overhauling immigration, has moved away from a lead role on the issue in the Senate.
 In Mr. Giuliani's case, his aides acknowledged that most voters do not know how aggressive he was as mayor in pressing for ways to allow more immigrants into the country.
 It was a role he seemed to cherish, becoming a national leader for the cause of welcoming immigrants in the 1990s. To the surprise of many people in both parties, he also spoke passionately about helping those here illegally become citizens, advocating for $12 million to start a city agency that would assist those seeking citizenship. He vigorously defended the city's policy of forbidding city employees, including police and hospital workers, from asking a person's immigration status.
 As other anti-immigration movements spread across the country in 1990s, Mr. Giuliani consistently pushed back. ''The anti-immigration issue that's now sweeping the country in my view is no different than the movements that swept the country in the past,'' he said in 1996. ''You look back at the Chinese Exclusionary Act, or the Know-Nothing movement -- these were movements that encouraged Americans to fear foreigners, to fear something that is different, and to stop immigration.''
 These days, when he says he opposes amnesty, Mr. Giuliani says he does not mean that the millions of people here illegally should be deported, but rather, that they should have to earn their citizenship and that nothing should be accorded automatically.
 On the campaign trail, he says the first order of business must be to try to identify the 12 million immigrants who are here illegally and issue them ''tamper-proof'' identification cards.
 Then, he said, they should start paying taxes. If they want to become citizens, they should have to ''get on the back of the line,'' he said.
 ''And then, at the end of the line, if they are ever going to become citizens,'' he said, ''the thing I am really interested in, they have to read English, write English, speak English and be able to understand the basics of American civics.''
 Mr. Giuliani has been wrestling with immigration issues since well before he was mayor. When he worked in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan, he defended the administration's policy of keeping thousands of Haitian refugees in detention centers and denying them asylum.
 When he first ran for mayor in 1989, with immigration a potent subject in city politics, Mr. Giuliani moved quickly to distance himself from that policy, and embraced a role as both a spokesman and protector of new immigrants through his power as mayor.
 Jack Martin, special projects director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which lobbies for strict immigration enforcement, said that in Mr. Giuliani's case, many of his organization's 250,000 members and advocates ''certainly are aware of the statements he has made in the past, extolling the virtues of immigrants in general and illegal immigrants to the economy of New York City.''
 These days, Mr. Giuliani frames the issue as one of national security. But as he talks about immigration on the campaign trail, Mr. Giuliani suggests that his core beliefs have not changed much since his days as mayor, often quoting a speech Abraham Lincoln gave in the 1850s.
 ''He made a beautiful speech in which he said the best American is not the American who has been here the longest or the one who just arrived,'' Mr. Giuliani said recently. ''It is the one who understands the principles of America the best because we are a country held together by ideas.''

HEADLINE: How Green Is My Taxi

BYLINE: By Bradley Tirpak and Dennis Tirpak. 
Bradley Tirpak is an equity portfolio manager. Dennis Tirpak is a former director of climate change policy at the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

 BODY:
EARLIER this month, at the New York International Auto Show, an exhibit celebrated the 100th anniversary of the gasoline-powered taxi in New York City. Across town, Mayor Michael Bloomberg was unveiling the first study of the city's greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Mayor Bloomberg knows these emissions contribute to global warming and has called the problem ''one of the most urgent tests of our time.'' He has set a goal of cutting the city's greenhouse gases by 30 percent by 2030. Part of his plan should be to mandate improved fuel efficiency for taxis -- and what better time to talk about this than today, Earth Day, as the mayor officially puts forward his outline for a greener city. 
There are 12,779 taxis on the streets of New York. Last year, these vehicles traveled more than 800 million miles. Ninety-two percent of these taxis are the Ford Crown Victoria, which the United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates gets 18 miles to the gallon. Because of traffic, the actual mileage achieved on New York City streets is about 30 percent less. 
 The environmental impact of the taxi fleet is enormous. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's carbon calculator, the average New York taxi emits more than 100,000 pounds of carbon dioxide each year. The total fleet emits nearly 580,000 metric tons. That is nearly 800 pounds for each resident of Manhattan and the equivalent of what 500,000 acres of pine forests would store in carbon for one year.
 Everyone knows that carbon dioxide emissions are a leading contributor to climate change. Climate change is melting glaciers in Greenland, the Andes, Alaska and Asia and threatening the polar ice caps. All this melting will lead to a significant rise in sea levels. More than 170 nations have endorsed the Kyoto Protocol in an attempt to tackle this problem. The United States has not ratified the agreement, but local officials are starting to move in the right direction. 
 Mayor Bloomberg is out front on climate change and he should continue to lead the nation on this issue. He has met with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California to collaborate on ways to reduce greenhouse gases. The governor recently signed a law to reduce emissions by 25 percent in California. Mayor Bloomberg has also signed an agreement with more than 450 other mayors to reduce global warming pollution, and next month the city will play host to a climate meeting involving mayors from more than 30 of the world's largest cities.
 The first step is to measure the city's greenhouse gas emissions. The second step is to reduce them.
 Mayor Bloomberg has completed the first step. The study he unveiled this month found that in 2005 New York City's greenhouse gas emissions totaled 58 million metric tons. 
 The mayor is now preparing the city for the second step: reducing emissions. Mandating improved fuel efficiency for the taxi fleet would be one simple way to help achieve the city's goals.
 The mandate would be inexpensive. The Taxi and Limousine Commission has evaluated six hybrid models that average 39 miles to the gallon. On average, these models cost $2,430 more than the Crown Victoria, but they would save $3,713 in fuel every year. It is a case where the short-term economics work in favor of immediate action.
 The mandate would cut greenhouse gas emissions from the fleet quickly. The city requires that most cabs be retired after three years. If improved mileage were mandated today, more than 90 percent of taxis would be upgraded decades before the mayor's 2030 goal.
 The mandate would be equitable. Recent taxi fare increases have resulted in a windfall for medallion owners. Since the 2004 increase, the value of medallions has soared by more than $100,000 and drivers' incomes are up 37 percent. In November, fares were raised yet again. Mandating some reinvestment of these windfalls to protect the environment is reasonable. 
 At the auto show, the goal of the taxi exhibition was to reinvent the New York City taxi system. It proposed models with improved roof lights, bigger passenger compartments and bolder graphics. Several designs incorporated hybrids, alternative fuels and zero emission technologies. 
 Mayor Bloomberg knows that New York, a city especially vulnerable to rising sea levels, cannot afford to ignore the reality of climate change. Mandates today can double the fuel economy of the fleet and halve their emissions. After 100 years on the road, it is time to paint New York City's taxis green.

HEADLINE: France Looks Ahead, and It Doesn't Look Good

BYLINE: By Tony Judt. 
Tony Judt is director of the Remarque Institute at New York University and the author of ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945.''

 BODY:
IT is easy to underestimate Jacques Chirac. 
 Today the French will begin to vote for a new president, and soon Mr. Chirac, the 74-year-old incumbent, will pass from the scene unmourned. Over a political career spanning nearly five decades, during which he was mayor of Paris, prime minister (twice) and president for 12 years, Mr. Chirac appears to have achieved little.
 As mayor from 1977 to 1995, he oversaw a steady rise in political corruption and municipal graft (albeit both at insignificant levels by American big-city standards). As president, he abandoned his promises to resolve shortcomings in France's employment laws and social services in the face of street protests. And he has done little to redress the grievances of France's minorities or the anxieties of young people. On both sides of the Atlantic, Mr. Chirac's political obituary is being written in distinctly unflattering terms.
 But is the French situation really so dire? From every quarter one hears calls for ''reform'' to bring France more in line with Anglo-American practices and policies. The dysfunctional French social model, we are frequently assured, has failed. 
 In that case there is much to be said for failure. French infants have a better chance of survival than American ones. The French live longer than Americans and they live healthier (at far lower cost). They are better educated and have first-rate public transportation. The gap between rich and poor is narrower than in the United States or Britain, and there are fewer poor people. 
 Yes, France has high youth unemployment, thanks to institutionalized impediments to job creation. But the comparison to American rates is misleading: our figures are artificially lowered because so many dark-skinned men aged 18 to 30 are in prison and thus off the unemployment rolls.
 Meanwhile, recall what Jacques Chirac has done. In 1995 he became the first president to acknowledge openly France's role in the Holocaust: ''The occupier was assisted by the French, by the French state,'' he said. ''France accomplished the irreparable.'' This was a phrase that would have stuck in the craw of his much-lauded predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, and, it must be said, of Charles de Gaulle himself. 
 However low his political fortunes, Mr. Chirac forbade his supporters to ally or compromise with Jean-Marie Le Pen's racist and xenophobic National Front -- again in contrast with Mr. Mitterrand, who cynically manipulated French election laws in 1986 to benefit Mr. Le Pen (and thus weaken the moderate right). 
 Conscious of Europe's links to the Muslim world -- and the cost of rebuffing and humiliating Islam's only secular democracy -- Mr. Chirac has steadfastly supported Turkish admission to the European Union, an unpopular stance among his conservative constituents. In 2004 he created the first French administrative agency with explicit powers to identify and fight discrimination. 
 On the global stage, he has been perhaps the most outspoken major world leader on global warming, warning that ''humanity is dancing on a volcano.'' And, of course, he initiated and led international opposition to President Bush's war in Iraq. 
 Let's not forget the hysterical Francophobia of 2003: not just the imbecilities of ''freedom fries'' but xenophobic outbursts from Congress, the Bush administration and the mainstream American press, where prominent commentators called for France to be thrown off the Security Council and offered to let French ''weasels'' hold our coats while Americans once again did their fighting for them. 
 It wasn't only Americans who objected. When in 2003 Mr. Chirac told the Eastern Europeans who backed Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain on Iraq that they had ''missed an opportunity to shut up,'' his blunt talk upset a lot of people and did little for France's popularity. 
 But in all of this, he has been proved right. By standing up to Mr. Bush and instructing his representatives at the United Nations to block a rush to an unprovoked war, the French president saved both the honor of the United Nations and the credibility of the international community. 
 It is not obvious that any of his likely successors would have done as well. Mr. Chirac is old enough to appreciate Europe's debt to America -- on the 60th anniversary of D-Day he said, sincerely, that ''France will never forget what it owes America, its steadfast friend and ally'' -- but Gaullist enough to oppose Washington's folies de grandeur. His heir presumptive, Nicolas Sarkozy, is neither. 
 Mr. Sarkozy's admiration and knowledge of the United States appear confined to its economic growth rate. He opposes Turkish membership in the European Union in the most intolerant terms: ''If you let 100 million Turkish Muslims come in, what will come of it?'' And his Gaullism is tainted by a weakness for rightist catchwords -- ''nation'' and ''identity,'' not to mention ''scum'' when referring to rioting minority youths -- with which he hopes to outflank Mr. Le Pen. 
 Segolene Royal, the socialists' candidate, has a Joan of Arc complex (in her declaration of candidacy last October she spoke of hearing ''calls'' and accepting ''this mission of conquest for France''), and she practices what could be called a ''soft'' demagogy. On crucial issues -- the European Union Constitution, Turkish admission to Europe -- she has avoided commitment, promising instead to ''listen to the people.''
 Many of Ms. Royal's socialist supporters manage to be both anti-American and anti-European: a Royal presidency would thus probably weaken the European Union without in any way strengthening France's trans-Atlantic leverage -- a leftist mirror of the agenda of neoconservative strategists in Washington. 
 Neither Mr. Sarkozy nor Ms. Royal (nor the centrist Francois Bayrou, the only other candidate with a serious chance of advancing to the runoff after today's initial voting) shares Mr. Chirac's historical appreciation of what is at stake in the construction of Europe: why it matters and why those who would divide or dilute it are playing with fire. 
 On this score, Mr. Chirac has reason to worry. Some new European Union member states want it both ways: to have an American-style low-tax economy that is underwritten by subsidies from Western European taxpayers. Poles and Czechs are happy to accept such handouts from Brussels, in the form of ''solidarity funds,'' yet at the same time welcome American missile defense systems without even consulting their fellow Europeans. Romania's entry into the union this year hasn't kept its president, Traian Basescu, from continuing to seek a ''strategic Washington-London-Bucharest axis.'' 
 In the hands of a new generation of politicians out for local advantage and indifferent to the past, Europe could unravel very quickly. Those who now celebrate Mr. Chirac's departure should recall Rhett Butler's admonition to Scarlett O'Hara when she sneered at the straggling remnants of the Confederate Army: ''Don't be in such a hurry to see them go, my dear; with them goes the last semblance of law and order.'' 
 With the departure of Jacques Chirac, we are saying goodbye to the last semblance of statesmanship from a generation that remembered where an unraveled Europe could lead. I fear we shall miss him.

HEADLINE: Goal! He Spends It on Beckham

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
ONE night here in the late 1960s, around the time that Philip F. Anschutz began laying the foundations of a multibillion-dollar fortune, a drilling supervisor at one of his Wyoming oil rigs phoned him with bad news: The well was on fire. And if the fire kept burning, it would bankrupt him.
 But there was a bright side, Mr. Anschutz reasoned. The fire meant that he had finally struck oil.
He rented a plane, flew to Wyoming, and by 8 the next morning gambled more money on his oil venture by buying up land around the burning well, according to an account that Mr. Anschutz provided to the State Historical Society of Colorado in 1974. He then hired Red Adair, a legendary oil-field firefighter, to put out the blaze, and, he said, invited a Hollywood studio to shoot the episode for the John Wayne thriller ''Hellfighters.'' 
 ''There's always a point that if you go forward you win, sometimes you win it all, and if you go back you lose everything,'' Mr. Anschutz told the historian, recalling the fires. ''That was that point for me.''
 Today, Mr. Anschutz is one of the wealthiest -- and most secretive -- tycoons in the country, parlaying early oil coups into real estate paydays, savvy runs at the railroad business, and the creation of Qwest Communications International, a telephony company that became mired in an accounting scandal. Last week, Qwest's former chief executive, Joseph P. Nacchio, was found guilty of federal stock fraud charges. (Mr. Nacchio plans to appeal the ruling).
 While the Qwest debacle bruised Mr. Anschutz's reputation, his deal-making has not slowed down. In his latest act, he is now the biggest backer of professional soccer in the United States, having recruited the British star David Beckham with a five-year, $27.5 million package to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy, the highest-profile of Mr. Anschutz's three soccer teams. 
 He has also started free newspapers to challenge local media incumbents like The Washington Post, and he controls America's largest theater chain -- giving him added heft as he pushes into film production with family-oriented and spiritually themed movies like ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,'' a box-office hit.
 Mr. Anschutz's senior managers say he is confident that he can convert one of the world's last big non-soccer-crazy nations to the sport, while also influencing the type of films that Hollywood produces. Amid the push and shove of the global media whirl, he wants to be an arbiter of taste, fashion and even moral values. 
 Acquaintances say Mr. Anschutz's embrace of Hollywood and the media business amounts to a wholesale reinvention that uses business lessons first learned in the oil fields. They also describe him as an authentic visionary and one of the most exciting businessmen of his generation. His critics, however, are less laudatory, describing him as overly fond of reckless financial wagers that have helped him advance hot-button political and social issues. 
 For his part, Mr. Anschutz declined to be interviewed about his businesses or his aspirations. But that penchant for privacy may be tested in the months and years ahead as he draws his corporate goals and personal values more brightly and publicly on the global skyline.
 ''Twenty years ago, you would have won an enormous amount of money with people who would have bet you that he would not touch the entertainment industry,'' says Tim Leiweke, one of Mr. Anschutz's chief lieutenants, who runs AEG, Mr. Anschutz's entertainment and sports enterprise, based in Los Angeles. ''But it does follow a pattern. He has an unbelievable gut instinct for what is about to come.''
 WHILE Mr. Anschutz has a well-known predilection for privacy, if you look closely enough you can catch glimpses of him around town. Dressed in his cycling clothes, he arrives for work at 5 a.m., say employees at a Starbucks in the Denver office tower that houses his holding company, the Anschutz Company. He often waves to them, they say.
 Mr. Anschutz regularly visits the nearby Barnes & Noble in the 16th Street Mall and sits quietly at the back. ''He is in here a lot,'' says Bob Holben, a bookseller. ''I think he wants to get out of the office. He is a really low-profile guy.'' 
 He is an honorary trustee of the American Museum of Natural History and a generous philanthropist; he has given more than $7 million to the University of Kansas and pledged nearly $100 million to a new hospital campus at the University of Colorado. Yet in the evenings, say those who know him well, he makes a point of leaving charity dinners before 10 p.m.
 He has lived in the same house in central Denver for more than 30 years and has been married to the same woman, Nancy, whom he met in college, for four decades. He also has three children -- one of whom, his son, Christian, is dating the ice-skating star Michelle Kwan. He likes to hunt, has run several marathons and, in February, was host for a special event at the Tour of California, a cycle race he is promoting. 
 Still, Mr. Anschutz remains elusive. One of the most tangible and easily seen signs of his presence in Denver is the blue Qwest logo emblazoned on that company's 709-foot tower. Far beyond the tower and the city limits lie the sprawling plains where Mr. Anschutz, a small, fit man of 67, grew up.
 Like his older sister, Sue Anschutz-Rogers, Mr. Anschutz was raised in Kansas, enveloped by their father's passion for real estate and oil. 
 ''My father had a real knack for buying ranch land which also became a successful oil field,'' Ms. Anschutz-Rogers recalled in an interview with a Denver historian. ''As a girl, I would go out with him to check on oil wells and sit there on the wellhead with him, waiting hopefully for it to come in.'' 
 Mr. Anschutz attended grade school in Hays, a town in western Kansas, before moving to high school in Wichita. His father was a hard-living speculator whose business went through good and bad times, sometimes pushing the family close to destitution. Whatever their fortunes, the family members were always neatly clothed, neighbors say. 
 After graduating with a degree in business from the University of Kansas in 1961, Mr. Anschutz intended to study law. But his father was ill and the oil business was on the verge of bankruptcy, so Mr. Anschutz moved to his father's Denver office and got his hands dirty in the oil patch. He began working as a contract driller, digging wells for other people until he could buy his own. 
 He currently owns three ranches, and his affinity for land has lasted throughout his life. ''I have always had faith in real estate,'' he said in the Colorado historical society interview, one of the few forums in which he has offered on-the-record recollections about his life and career.
 In 1980, Amoco discovered major oil and gas reserves in Wyoming, abutting the Anschutz Ranch East -- a discovery that meant Mr. Anschutz was sitting on one of the biggest oil finds in decades. In 1982, as the oil market was booming, he sold half of his holdings to Mobil Oil for $500 million. ''Anschutz was ahead of the curve because he got out before oil prices hit 10 bucks a barrel,'' said Ron Rizzuto, a business professor at the University of Denver, of the subsequent price drop that crushed the oil market. ''It was brilliant timing.''
 Two years later, already having diversified into mining and Denver real estate, Mr. Anschutz latched onto railroads -- deeply unfashionable relics from the 19th century. He bought a small local railroad before acquiring for $1.5 billion the vast Southern Pacific railroad, which had been slammed by years of underinvestment and competitive pressure from trucking. 
 ''We got it on Oct. 13, 1988, and by January we realized we had a terrible hole,'' said Robert F. Starzel, a lawyer who worked for the Anschutz Company for three decades. ''We had negative cash flow of $450,000 a day.''
 Mr. Anschutz moved to San Francisco, Southern Pacific's home, for five days a week, taking a room in the Hyatt, and forced Southern Pacific to modernize its systems and controls. He also extended the line's geographical reach to Chicago, while selling off $2 billion in other unwanted routes and real estate. He took Southern Pacific public in 1993 and then merged it with Union Pacific three years later in a $5.4 billion deal. He still owns slightly less than one percent of Union Pacific, a stake worth around $273 million, and until last year had a seat on the board.
 Mr. Starzel, who is one of Mr. Anschutz's closest friends, says that the mogul enjoys taking aggressive, all-or-nothing risks. ''His father was a real deal maker -- he took Phil around as a young child to show him how deals were made,'' Mr. Starzel says. ''One of Phil's requirements in life and business is to have a number of things going at the same time because he recognizes that any one or two might fail.''
 Southern Pacific owned a small unit that laid fiber-optic cable beside railroad tracks for other companies, a business that Mr. Anschutz decided to expand. After banks refused to back the expansion, he created a separate company, SP Telecom, that included the fiber-optics business and the railroad's rights of way that allowed him to lay cable along Southern Pacific's route. That company eventually became Qwest, a darling of the late '90s Internet boom; Mr. Anschutz took it public in 1997 in a $297 million offering.
 ''He didn't claim to know telecoms, but it was an asset, the rights of way, that he thought that he could make a little bit of money on,'' says Dan Reingold, a former telecommunications analyst. 
 A little bit of money, indeed: by 2000, Mr. Anschutz's fortune, enhanced by Qwest stock, had grown to more than $15 billion.
 Mr. Anschutz took Qwest public a year after the entire telecommunications business was deregulated, causing the industry's overall fortunes to soar. To move things along, he hired Mr. Nacchio, a top AT&T salesman, to steer Qwest's growth. Together in 2000, Mr. Nacchio and Mr. Anschutz won a $43.5 billion all-stock bid for U S West, the Denver-based telephone company whose cash-rich coffers provided the money to pay for the expansion of Qwest's network. Qwest also took on piles of new debt. 
 AND that's when the bubble began to burst. Use of the Internet did not expand as quickly as they had anticipated, and new compression technology meant that voice and data traffic could be carried by using a small fraction of the capacity of the cables that Qwest had laid down, so much of that expensive new network went unused. 
 As the entire telecommunications sector came under siege amid missed revenue goals and overly rosy financial projections, Qwest's share price crashed from a peak of $66 in March 2000 to just over $1 by August 2002. In October 2003, Qwest revised downward by $2.48 billion its revenue for 2000 and 2001. The next year, it paid $250 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charges without denying or admitting guilt. (Mr. Anschutz recruited a new chief executive to replace Mr. Nacchio; Qwest stabilized and was profitable for the first time in 2006. Its shares currently trade at $8.88.) 
 The Qwest sell-off lopped billions of dollars from Mr. Anschutz's fortune and, analysts say, may have harmed his reputation. Although those close to Mr. Anschutz say the media have unfairly linked him to the Qwest debacle, he was a director and non-executive chairman of the company until 2002. He remained a director until 2006. He also sold more than $1.5 billion in Qwest stock between 1998 and 2001, which, according to a spokesman, was done only at the request of a major outside investor; the spokesman said the proceeds from the sales were reinvested in other businesses.
 Even so, Mr. Anschutz's other stock dealings drew unwanted attention. In 2002, Eliot Spitzer, then New York's attorney general, sued Mr. Anschutz and four other chief executives, accusing them of receiving shares in lucrative public offerings in exchange for passing on investment banking business. Mr. Anschutz denied any wrongdoing, but settled the charges; his company said he was victimized by a change in public opinion after the telecommunications collapse.
 Mr. Nacchio was found guilty on federal stock fraud charges last week in Denver in relation to his sale of $101 million in Qwest shares in 2001. A jury said he illegally profited from stock sales he made with inside knowledge that Qwest was unlikely to meet revenue targets. Mr. Anschutz has not been charged with any wrongdoing involving anything at Qwest. Although Mr. Nacchio has said that Mr. Anschutz was involved in every major decision at Qwest, some federal authorities have said Mr. Anschutz had no knowledge of financial machinations at the company.
 In response to questions about Qwest's financial troubles, a spokesman said that Mr. Anschutz and other directors took action any time they learned of a problem but that they were not told about everything going on at the company -- an argument that not everyone accepts.
 ''Ignorance is no excuse if you are on the board, particularly if you are someone who was as vitally involved as he was,'' said Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a nonprofit group that monitors corporate boards. ''If he knew, then he was making a mistake. If he didn't know, he was making a bigger mistake.'' 
 Mr. Anschutz left the Qwest board last year, and said he would sell his remaining 17 percent stake in the company over the next several years. About three weeks ago, he took the witness stand in Denver during Mr. Nacchio's trial. He arrived at the courthouse at about 6:30 a.m., well before reporters, and later offered testimony about his relationship with Mr. Nacchio.
 He said that Jack Grubman, the former leading telecommunications analyst who has been barred from the securities industry for issuing misleading financial reports, recommended that he hire Mr. Nacchio. Mr. Anschutz also said that his role as non-executive chairman was ''really ceremonial'' and that Mr. Nacchio did not run every major decision by him. A video posted on the Web site of The Denver Post shows Mr. Anschutz departing the courthouse surrounded by four men in suits and being whisked away in a silver Audi.
 Mr. Anschutz loathes self-aggrandizement and never likes seeing his name in the papers, says a spokesman, Jim Monaghan. Others who have worked for him say that he even takes a back seat in business meetings.
 ''The first time I saw him outside a meeting at Qwest, he wore a very basic suit and business loafers,'' says Stephen Martin, a former legal counsel at Qwest and now a professor at the University of Denver. ''You would not have thought that was the billionaire who created Qwest. He blended in.''
 Mr. Starzel, Mr. Anschutz's longtime business associate, concurs. ''He tries not to have an ego because it gets in the way,'' he says, also noting Mr. Anschutz's preoccupation with proper comportment. ''He likes things to be spick-and-span. I have been in a meeting when he has told somebody, 'Don't sip your coffee like that.' ''
 When Qwest's fortunes first began slipping, Mr. Anschutz had already embarked on another venture -- in movie theaters. In 2000 and 2001, he bought three bankrupt theater chains -- United Artists Theaters, Regal Cinemas and Edwards Theaters -- with a partner, Oaktree Capital Management. Like the railroads, the theater business was in disarray because chains had overspent by building new sites with stadium-style seating. 
 Mr. Anschutz bought the companies' debt, converted it to stock and used bankruptcy procedures to break the theaters' property leases and shutter underused theaters. He rolled the three chains into a single entity, the Regal Entertainment Group, which now has 6,386, or 18 percent, of screens in the United States. It went public in 2002, in a $342 million public offering; the theaters have returned to profit although their earnings have not been stellar and the stock has traded erratically. 
 Mr. Anschutz's team continues to work on a turnaround. They have found ways to fill theaters with alternative events when films are not showing, like networked business meetings and broadcasts of live shows. The Metropolitan Opera in New York is showing live operas on its screens, and Regal theaters are also offered as places for worship to faith-based organizations. (Religion is a pillar of Mr. Anschutz's life, friends say; a Presbyterian, he attends church services regularly with his family.) 
 Regal's biggest innovation has been the introduction of national advertising before the feature presentation. ''Theaters were already selling advertising, but because they were not national, they were attracting local car dealers,'' says Marla S. Backer, an analyst at Soleil -- Research Associates. ''But now all of those cinemas together can bring in national advertisers.''
 All of this, associates say, reflects Mr. Anschutz's modus operandi. ''What he tends to do is buy at the right price, and makes sure there is something else you can do with the asset you are buying,'' says Kurt C. Hall, who runs Regal's advertising arm, a joint venture with two other companies; it was spun off this year. 
 Last year, as he had done at Qwest and Union Pacific, Mr. Anschutz stepped down from the Regal board. That cleared the way for yet another new phase in his career, one in which he seems much more willing than in the past to publicly project his moral beliefs to the world around him through films, sports and newspapers.
 Mr. Anschutz's interest in entertainment dates from the 1980s, when he tried to build a convention center and sports and entertainment district on railway land he owned in Denver. The city picked a different site, which associates say was a bitter setback. Undeterred, he waited for another opportunity to build and own an entertainment venue, control the events there, and own the surrounding real estate -- a trifecta that would cause the value of each of those components to rise by being linked to the others. 
 He spotted such an opening in 1995 and phoned Mr. Leiweke. ''He called me and said, 'Tim, that thing we were going to do in Denver, we are going to do it in L.A.,''' recalls Mr. Leiweke, 49, the head of AEG.
 That year, Mr. Anschutz and a partner bought the bankrupt Los Angeles Kings hockey team for $113 million; in 1998, they bought a stake in the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team. That same year they also broke ground on a new Los Angeles sports arena, the Staples Center. Today, the Staples Center is anchored by Kings and Lakers games, and AEG makes money from, among other things, ticket sales, merchandising and sponsorship. It fills out the days when the teams aren't playing with concerts and shows. 
 AEG is now developing a $2.5 billion, four-million-square-foot entertainment district around the Staples Center called L.A. Live, which will include hotels, restaurants and Regal theater screens. AEG is deploying the same model as it builds entertainment complexes overseas, in central Berlin and in east London at the Millennium Dome. Mr. Leiweke says AEG also has plans for ''something'' soon in Asia, although he won't be more specific.
 THE sports and entertainment platforms that Mr. Anschutz has developed are also a launching pad for what analysts say is his biggest gamble yet: the rollout of soccer as a major American sport, starring one of the game's thoroughbreds, David Beckham. 
 Mr. Anschutz initially became interested in soccer, associates say, because he sees it as family-friendly, something that parents and children can play and watch together -- a view that offers one of the more public instances in which Mr. Anschutz's business and personal interests overlap.
 Mr. Anschutz is a major donor to the Republican Party, and his philanthropic arm, the Anschutz Foundation, gives money to conservative causes, including a group that opposed anti-discrimination laws protecting gays and lesbians; organizations that fight Internet pornography; and groups that oppose possible bias in the media. He also gives to evangelical Christian groups. But executives who work with him say his private beliefs have never influenced his business decisions. 
 His friend Mr. Starzel says the best example of Mr. Anschutz's social activism is provided by another organization he funds, the Foundation for a Better Life, which sponsors thousands of high-profile advertisements on billboards along highways, in cities, on television and in theaters. 
 The advertisements are largely noncontroversial, apolitical and multifaith. The billboards celebrate values like commitment, hard work and self-confidence, alongside pictures of such luminaries as Einstein, Whoopi Goldberg, Gandhi and others. A billboard at the Denver airport shows Michelle Kwan and says: ''What makes champions? Dedication. Pass it on.'' Others feature Mother Teresa, Muhammad Ali and Shrek.
 Mr. Anschutz and his colleagues also clearly think David Beckham is what makes champions. When Major League Soccer, the fledgling American league, was founded in 1996, Mr. Anschutz owned just one team, the Colorado Rapids (which he later sold). But by 2002 he had control of 6 of the 10 clubs then in the league. Today he has three teams -- out of a league total of 13 -- playing in Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston.
 Don Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer, says the future for the sport is bright here because of the growing Hispanic population and because millions of youngsters now play soccer at school. ''Phil is just a great media visionary and understands the importance of content and how it can help drive strategy and growth,'' he says, adding that the soccer league would not exist without Mr. Anschutz. 
 Yet some skeptics are dubious that America will ever embrace soccer. ''They have been saying for a long time that soccer is ready to take off,'' said Stefan Szymanski, an economist at Imperial College in London who has specialized in the economics and business of sports. ''There is a cultural objection to soccer in the United States.''
 NONE of that pessimism has held back Mr. Anschutz. In 2003, he opened a $150 million soccer-specific stadium and sports complex, the Home Depot Center, in Carson, Calif., for his Galaxy team. Last year, the soccer league changed its rules so that a club could set the salary of at least one of its players locally and thus break a salary cap of $2.1 million per team. That cleared the way for Mr. Anschutz to bring Mr. Beckham from Real Madrid to Los Angeles this year. 
 AEG executives say they are interested in Mr. Beckham for his on-the-field skills, but transplanting an athlete who is also a global media and fashion star to Los Angeles is the clearest equation yet of soccer with entertainment and celebrity. The wooing of Mr. Beckham involved old-fashioned networking.
 Mr. Leiweke, the AEG chief executive, got to know Mr. Beckham when AEG helped the star set up a soccer school in east London; Mr. Beckham subsequently opened another at the Home Depot Center. Mr. Anschutz and his wife met the soccer star briefly on the field at the Home Depot Center when Real Madrid played there two years ago.
 Mr. Leiweke also got to know Simon Fuller, who is Mr. Beckham's manager and the creator of the ''American Idol'' megafranchise, when AEG helped to organize an ''American Idol'' tour. 
 When Mr. Beckham's contract with Real Madrid came up for renegotiation on Jan. 1, talks began among AEG, Mr. Fuller and Mr. Beckham's representatives in London and Los Angeles. On Jan. 10, Mr. Leiweke, who had just returned on a flight from London, signed the contract for Mr. Beckham's hiring in the baggage claim area at Los Angeles International Airport. Mr. Beckham is slated to receive around $5 million a year, although his agents say endorsements and sponsorships could take his earnings to $250 million over the five-year contract.
 In what might be described as the ''Beckham bounce,'' AEG said last week that since signing Mr. Beckham, the Galaxy had booked an added $13.3 million from ticket sales and other sources -- more than enough to cover two years of the soccer star's salary.
 Although British tabloids have been filled with accounts of Mr. Beckham's extra-marital exploits, Mr. Leiweke favors words like ''respect,'' ''integrity,'' ''character'' and ''family'' when discussing the virtues that attracted AEG to the soccer star.
 ''It's that blue-collar work ethic in him, that is why we bet on David Beckham,'' he says. Mr. Leiweke says AEG is now in talks to bring a second international star to the Chicago Fire, another of Mr. Anschutz's soccer teams. ''We are working on a deal right now,'' he says, before suggesting whom he is trying to snare. ''There are only four players that move the needle: Ronaldo. Beckham. Zidane. Ronaldinho.''
 IF Mr. Anschutz sees an underappreciated asset in soccer, he sees the same in another out-of-favor business: newspapers. He had long had an interest in newspapers, according to Mr. Starzel, whose own father worked for The Associated Press, and they had many conversations about the industry.
 In February 2004, Mr. Anschutz bought The San Francisco Examiner. Like many other newspapers, The Examiner had falling readership and advertising. But Mr. Anschutz saw an opportunity to create a low-cost newspaper model that better served local readers and advertisers, which he thought traditional papers were ignoring.
 ''We decided there continues to be a big appetite for news and information, especially local news and local information, and news that has some use to it,'' said Ryan McKibben, a former Denver Post publisher who now heads the Anschutz Company's media division, which includes its newspapers and related Web sites.
 Later in 2004, Mr. Anschutz bought Journal Newspapers Inc., publisher of three suburban dailies in the Washington area, and renamed them The Washington Examiner. Last year he opened another paper, The Baltimore Examiner. His publications are free and are mostly delivered to homes. Home delivery is the best way, Mr. McKibben says, to reach readers that advertisers most desire: 25- to 54-year-olds with household incomes of more than $75,000. All the Examiner papers use census data to target those readers, and Mr. McKibben said the papers' low overhead (staff sizes are small) means that they can charge advertising rates that are 40 percent to 50 percent lower than those of incumbent newspapers.
 Mr. Anschutz has trademarked The Examiner name in 63 other cities in the United States and already has Web sites covering 20 of them. Mr. McKibben says the Examiner papers are not trying to steal readers from city dailies like The Washington Post, but are seeking new customers who have not previously read newspapers. 
 Mr. Anschutz's papers are still small. The San Francisco Examiner, for example, has a circulation of just 200,000 (including 150,000 by home delivery), Mr. McKibben says, while the Washington paper has a circulation of 260,000 (210,000 by home delivery). The papers favor short articles and wire copy, but Mr. McKibben notes that they have also successfully hired veteran reporters. Even so, some question the papers' journalistic and financial merits.
 ''They do not strive to be high-quality,'' said Sammy Papert, chief executive of Belden Associates, a newspaper consulting firm. ''There are new audiences, certainly, but what is less certain is whether the financial underpinnings are solid.''
 Mr. McKibben defends the quality of his papers and says they are designed to meet the needs of the market they serve. He declined to discuss the papers' finances, but said that a recent audit indicated that readers were spending time with the publications.
 Leaving no business stone left unturned, Mr. Anschutz has also plunged headlong into filmmaking.
 In a speech at a leadership seminar in Naples, Fla., in 2004, Mr. Anschutz explained why he's gone Hollywood. He said that digital production and distribution were upending the film business, opening opportunities for entrepreneurs like him. He also said that he believed that Hollywood had wandered too far away from mainstream tastes by misreading ''the market and the mood of a large segment of the movie-going audience today.''
 ''Why can't movies return to being something that we can go and see with our children and our grandchildren without being embarrassed or on the edge of our seats?'' he asked.
 His corporate answer to that question is Crusader Entertainment, which he set up in 2000 (later renaming it Bristol Bay Productions). Its first film, ''Joshua,'' was about a Christ-like figure in modern rural America. In 2001, he invested in Walden Media, a production company that specializes in family films. Micheal Flaherty, Walden's co-founder, says the company makes movies based on existing stories already popular among children; Walden does market research in schools to unearth stories that children find fetching and markets its films as educational material to teachers and librarians.
 Some of Mr. Anschutz's early films flopped, but he has also enjoyed some notable successes. ''Ray,'' a biopic of Ray Charles that Mr. Anschutz championed against reservations from his film executives, went on to win an Oscar for its star, Jamie Foxx. During the film's production, according to Mr. Flaherty and David Weil, who heads the Anschutz Film Group, Mr. Anschutz intervened to tone down some of the racier material to make the film more suitable for a family audience. 
 His biggest film hit by far has been ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,'' which is based on the Narnia series of children's books by the British Christian writer, C. S. Lewis. The filming of the next installment in the Narnia series, ''Prince Caspian,'' has finished in New Zealand and moved on to Prague; ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' will be next.
 The Narnia stories are all Christian allegories. ''Amazing Grace,'' a current Walden film, is about one of Mr. Anschutz's heroes, William Wilberforce, a British politician and evangelical Christian who fought the slave trade. Bristol Bay plans a film about another C. S. Lewis book, ''The Screwtape Letters,'' an epistolary novel about devils fighting over human souls.
 ''There is a common theme in all our films,'' Mr. Flaherty said. ''They all come with great stories of redemption and an incredible optimism. It is never too late.''
 Mr. Anschutz's forays into newspapers and films have prompted concerns that he might use his billions to impose his private beliefs on others. His move into the liberal Bay Area prompted The San Francisco Bay Guardian to declare in 2005 that The Examiner ''espouses a general pro-big business, conservative ideology that's out of touch with the San Francisco mainstream.''
 (The paper also praised The Examiner for improved reporting quality and said that it was making a rival, The San Francisco Chronicle, up its game).
 The first Narnia film drew notice from some commentators for its heavy Christian symbolism. The Guardian, a liberal British paper, said the film was ''a neat synergy of politics, religion and product placement.'' After Jeb Bush, then the governor of Florida, picked ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,'' for a public school reading program, The Palm Beach Post said the book was being used as ''a way to subtly introduce the Christ story to young people.'' 
 Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit group, criticized Mr. Bush as promoting an overtly Christian tale in the public school system. ''We just found it was inappropriate for a government official to do this,'' Mr. Lynn says.
 A spokesman for Mr. Anschutz says that his films appeal to a diverse audience and are not meant to proselytize. His film and newspaper executives say he grants them plenty of independence and point out that while some of his films may have religious connotations, others do not.
 Mr. Anschutz himself has not responded directly to his critics, but in his Florida speech three years ago he recounted why he became a filmmaker, providing some insight into his thinking. ''I decided to stop cursing the darkness -- I had been complaining about movies and their content for years -- and instead to do something about it,'' he said. ''And yes, I saw a chance with this movie to attempt some small improvement in the culture.''

HEADLINE: A Shady Plan By the Mayor That's Likely To Be Popular

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
Among the list of contentious proposals that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is expected to announce today in his ambitious effort to steer the city toward a greener future, here's one that is likely to receive little argument: more trees. 
 The city intends to plant a million trees during the next 10 years, filling every sidewalk vacancy with one and adding thousands to parks and public spaces.
City planners say the additional trees will help clean the air, soak up ozone-depleting carbon dioxide and make the city a little bit cooler in the summer, reducing energy demands. 
 ''We believe this is the most ambitious tree-planting program ever undertaken, certainly by any American city,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. 
 The proposal is one of 127 initiatives that the mayor's staff unveiled yesterday in a briefing with reporters at City Hall. The briefing was held on condition that only the tree-planting proposal be revealed until Mr. Bloomberg announces the full plan in his Earth Day speech today at the American Museum of Natural History. 
 The plan will provide specifics on achieving and paying for each of the measures, which are intended to ease traffic congestion, increase affordable housing, reclaim contaminated land and improve mass transit as the city prepares to make room for an estimated 1 million new residents during the next two decades. 
 A key objective is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030. 
 Despite Mr. Bloomberg's efforts to keep the details secret, many elements of the plan have leaked out in recent days, including a controversial measure to charge drivers to enter the busiest areas of Manhattan. Another proposal calls for the creation of an authority to finance major infrastructure improvements and, in the process, wrest some control over large-scale projects from agencies like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Empire State Development Corporation, over which the city has little say. 
 Few people, however, are likely to object to another tree on their block, especially in areas where concrete overwhelms any hint of green.
 The city estimates it has about 5.2 million trees, covering about 24 percent of the five boroughs' land mass. The national average for cities is about 27 percent. A little more than 592,000 of New York's trees are planted along the street, and the city would like to increase that number by 210,000 during the next decade. 
 Joshua Laird, assistant commissioner of planning for the city's Parks and Recreation Department, said it will cost about $37 million annually to plant and maintain 1 million more trees.
 In addition to cleaner air and reduced energy demands that new trees would bring, Mr. Laird said they also would capture more storm water runoff, reducing pollution in the rivers. 
 The plan also would require trees to be planted at new developments.
 Officials said they hope the program will stop the city's long history of losing trees to development. Between 1984 and 2002, New York lost some 9,000 acres of vegetative cover, according to city estimates. 
 ''If you think about the history of New York City,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''this fundamentally reverses the history of deforestation that has taken place pretty much since the city was settled.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 26, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies on Sunday about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to plant a million trees in New York City over the next 10 years misstated the role of carbon dioxide, which trees absorb, in ozone layer depletion. In fact, it has no effect.

HEADLINE: Corzine's Rehab Could Free Him For Policy Issues

BYLINE: By David W. Chen

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
GIVEN the extent of Gov. Jon S. Corzine's injuries, it appeared unlikely late last week that he would be resuming his hectic schedule as the state's chief executive officer anytime soon.
 It could be weeks. It could be months. It could be a year before he would be able to fill his daily calendar once again with the events, ceremonial meetings and the political dinners that can keep a New Jersey governor regularly traveling from one corner of the state to another.
 But maybe, for Mr. Corzine, and the people of New Jersey, restricting his ability to fulfill many of his ceremonial and political duties might not be such a terrible thing. 
 Perhaps, Mr. Corzine may be afforded a rarity for most politicians these days: more time to immerse himself in the state's business, to thumb through arcane policy papers and budget documents, and to come up with new policies and ideas.
 After all, there is no shortage of pressing and complicated issues demanding attention.
 Just this past week, the State Commission of Investigation accused a state subsidy program for hospitals of being riddled with fraud and waste to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in losses each year. The state's labor commissioner told legislators that the state's fund for unemployment benefits has dropped to only $260 million from $3.1 billion five years ago, because of past practices of siphoning money away to help balance the budget.
 And the state treasurer, Bradley I. Abelow, testified before the Assembly's budget committee about accounting practices used in the state pension fund prior to the Corzine administration.
 People tend to forget that a big part of the governor's job description is performing ceremonial or constitutional functions. That means waving to residents at parades on Main Street, delivering speeches to trade associations, reading to children in schools and libraries.
 Then there is the sheer volume of political commitments. As the only elected statewide official, at least until the office of the lieutenant governor is created, the governor is also the titular head of his or her party. There are always county chairmen and chairwomen to appease, new mayors to meet, national candidates to raise money for. Not to mention the endless opportunities for political dinners on any given evening. 
 Since the medical experts were saying late last week that Mr. Corzine would have limited mobility for some time, he could decline requests that might have been impolite for him to reject before. 
 If so, he might be able to turn his full attention to the central issues that he cares deeply about, like the leasing of toll roads, a new school financing formula or universal health care. 
 ''As the governor is rehabilitating, I believe he will be in charge,'' said William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, and a 30-year veteran of Trenton politics. ''In fact he will probably have more time to spend on policy with the less demanding schedule he will have.''
 In a typical election year for the Legislature -- like 2007 -- almost half of a governor's time could be spent on political activities like fund-raisers and postdinner rallies, said Carl Golden, a former spokesman for Governors Thomas H. Kean and Christie Whitman.
 Another 20 percent, perhaps, could be devoted to ceremonial activities with a dash of policy, like a ribbon-cutting event at a local school that also happens to mention an educational goal. That does not leave much time for the nitty-gritty of state business, and focusing on policies and legislative initiatives, Mr. Golden said.
 ''He can conduct business without being distracted by something like, 'I have to leave this budget meeting because I have to meet with six county chairmen in Cape May,' '' he said. ''But he has to be careful, as he does that, to not create a perception that he's ceding some of the power of the office.''
 Consider, for instance, Governor Corzine's packed schedule on April 12, the day of his auto accident on the Garden State Parkway.
 First, he attended the funeral of a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in Pottstown, Pa. Then he brokered a peace between two rival Democratic camps in Hackensack. Then, he had two events in Atlantic City, including a speech to members of the New Jersey Conference of Mayors. Last up was a meeting at Drumthwacket between the former talk-show radio host Don Imus and the Rutgers women's basketball team.
 Of all those events, you could argue that the only one he had to attend was the funeral. For the Bergen County announcement, perhaps he could have dispatched Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, the state Democratic party chairman? For the others, perhaps a cabinet official or other surrogate, like Mr. Codey, may have sufficed?
 Of course, Corzine administration officials may be reluctant to rely too much on Mr. Codey. While Mr. Corzine and Mr. Codey have been allies on many issues since Mr. Corzine took office in January 2006, it does not make political sense for the Corzine camp to give the New Jersey public even more of a reason to love Mr. Codey, the state's most popular politician.

HEADLINE: Iraq Is the Ultimate Aphrodisiac

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH has skipped the funerals of the troops he sent to Iraq. He took his sweet time to get to Katrina-devastated New Orleans. But last week he raced to Virginia Tech with an alacrity not seen since he hustled from Crawford to Washington to sign a bill interfering in Terri Schiavo's end-of-life medical care. Mr. Bush assumes the role of mourner in chief on a selective basis, and, as usual with the decider, the decisive factor is politics. Let Walter Reed erupt in scandal, and he'll take six weeks to show his face -- and on a Friday at that, to hide the story in the Saturday papers. The heinous slaughter in Blacksburg, Va., by contrast, was a rare opportunity for him to ostentatiously feel the pain of families whose suffering cannot be blamed on the administration. 
 But he couldn't inspire the kind of public acclaim that followed his post-9/11 visit to ground zero or the political comeback that buoyed his predecessor after Oklahoma City. The cancer on the Bush White House, Iraq, is now spreading too fast. The president had barely returned to Washington when the empty hope of the ''surge'' was hideously mocked by a one-day Baghdad civilian death toll more than five times that of Blacksburg's. McClatchy Newspapers reported that the death rate for American troops over the past six months was at its all-time high for this war.
At home, the president is also hobbled by the Iraq cancer's metastasis -- the twin implosions of Alberto Gonzales and Paul Wolfowitz. Technically, both men have been pilloried for sins unrelated to the war. The attorney general has repeatedly been caught changing his story about the extent of his involvement in purging eight federal prosecutors. The Financial Times caught the former deputy secretary of defense turned World Bank president privately dictating the extravagant terms of a State Department sinecure for a crony (a k a romantic partner) that showers her with more take-home pay than Condoleezza Rice.
 Yet each man's latest infractions, however serious, are mere misdemeanors next to their roles in the Iraq war. What's being lost in the Beltway uproar is the extent to which the lying, cronyism and arrogance showcased by the current scandals are of a piece with the lying, cronyism and arrogance that led to all the military funerals that Mr. Bush dares not attend. Having slept through the fraudulent selling of the war, Washington is still having trouble confronting the big picture of the Bush White House. Its dense web of deceit is the deliberate product of its amoral culture, not a haphazard potpourri of individual blunders. 
 Mr. Gonzales's politicizing of the Justice Department is a mere bagatelle next to his role as White House counsel in 2002, when he helped shape the administration's legal argument to justify torture. That paved the way for Abu Ghraib, the episode that destroyed America's image and gave terrorists a moral victory. But his efforts to sabotage national security didn't end there. In a front-page expose lost in the Imus avalanche two Sundays ago, The Washington Post uncovered Mr. Gonzales's reckless role in vetting the nomination of Bernard Kerik as secretary of homeland security in December 2004. 
 Mr. Kerik, you may recall, withdrew from consideration for that cabinet post after a week of embarrassing headlines. Back then, the White House ducked any culpability for the mess by attributing it to a single legal issue, a supposedly undocumented nanny, and by pinning it on a single, nonadministration scapegoat, Mr. Kerik's longtime patron, Rudy Giuliani. The president's spokesman at the time, Scott McClellan, told reporters that the White House had had ''no reason to believe'' that Mr. Kerik lied during his vetting process and that it would be inaccurate to say that process had been rushed. 
 THANKS to John Solomon and Peter Baker of The Post, we now know that Mr. McClellan's spin was no more accurate than his exoneration of Karl Rove and Scooter Libby in the Wilson leak case. The Kerik vetting process was indeed rushed -- by Mr. Gonzales -- and the administration had every reason to believe that it was turning over homeland security to a liar. Mr. Gonzales was privy from the get-go to a Kerik dossier ablaze with red flags pointing to ''questionable financial deals, an ethics violation, allegations of mismanagement and a top deputy prosecuted for corruption,'' not to mention a ''friendship with a businessman who was linked to organized crime.'' Yet Mr. Gonzales and the president persisted in shoving Mr. Kerik into the top job of an already troubled federal department encompassing 22 agencies, 180,000 employees and the very safety of America in the post-9/11 era. 
 Mr. Kerik may soon face federal charges, and at a most inopportune time for the Giuliani presidential campaign. But it's as a paradigm of the Bush White House's waging of the Iraq war that the Kerik case is most telling. The crucial point to remember is this: Even had there been no alleged improprieties in the former police chief's New York resume, there still would have been his public record in Iraq to disqualify him from any administration job. 
 The year before Mr. Kerik's nomination to the cabinet, he was dispatched by the president to take charge of training the Iraqi police -- and completely failed at that mission. As Rajiv Chandrasekaran recounts in his invaluable chronicle of Green Zone shenanigans, ''Imperial Life in the Emerald City,'' Mr. Kerik slept all day and held only two staff meetings, one upon arrival and one for the benefit of a Times reporter doing a profile. Rather than train Iraqi police, Mr. Kerik gave upbeat McCain-esque appraisals of the dandy shopping in Baghdad's markets.
 Had Mr. Kerik actually helped stand up an Iraqi police force instead of hastening its descent into a haven for sectarian death squads, there might not now be extended tours for American troops in an open-ended escalation of the war. But in the White House's priorities, rebuilding Iraq came in a poor third to cronyism and domestic politics. Mr. Kerik's P.R. usefulness as a symbol of 9/11 was particularly irresistible to an administration that has exploited the carnage of 9/11 in ways both grandiose (to gin up the Iraq invasion) and tacky (in 2004 campaign ads).
 Mr. Kerik was an exploiter of 9/11 in his own right: he had commandeered an apartment assigned to ground zero police and rescue workers to carry out his extramarital tryst with the publisher Judith Regan. The sex angle of Mr. Wolfowitz's scandal is a comparable symptom of the hubris that warped the judgment of those in power after 9/11. Not only did he help secure Shaha Riza her over-the-top raise in 2005, but as The Times reported, he also helped get her a junket to Iraq when he was riding high at the Pentagon in 2003. No one seems to know what she actually accomplished there, but the bill was paid by a Defense Department contractor that has since come under official scrutiny for its noncompetitive contracts and poor performance. So it went with the entire Iraq fiasco. 
 You don't have to be a cynic to ask if the White House's practice of bestowing better jobs on those who bungled the war might be a form of hush money. Mr. Wolfowitz was promoted to the World Bank despite a Pentagon record that included (in part) his prewar hyping of bogus intelligence about W.M.D. and a nonexistent 9/11-Saddam connection; his assurance to the world that Iraq's oil revenues would pay for reconstruction; and his public humiliation of Gen. Eric Shinseki after the general dared tell Congress (correctly) that several hundred thousand troops would be needed to secure Iraq after the invasion. Once the war began, Mr. Wolfowitz cited national security to bar businesses from noncoalition countries (like Germany) from competing for major contracts in Iraq. That helped ensure the disastrous monopoly of Halliburton and other White House-connected companies, including the one that employed Ms. Riza. 
 Had Iraqi reconstruction, like the training of Iraqi police, not been betrayed by politics and cronyism, the Iraq story might have a different ending. But maybe not all that different. The cancer on the Bush White House connects and contaminates all its organs. It's no surprise that one United States attorney fired without plausible cause by the Gonzales Justice Department, Carol Lam, was in hot pursuit of defense contractors with administration connections. Or that another crony brought by Mr. Wolfowitz to the World Bank was caught asking the Air Force secretary to secure a job for her brother at a defense contractor while she was overseeing aspects of the Air Force budget at the White House. A government with values this sleazy couldn't possibly win a war. 
 Like the C.I.A. leak case, each new scandal is filling in a different piece of the elaborate White House scheme to cover up the lies that took us into Iraq and the failures that keep us mired there. As the cover-up unravels and Congress steps up its confrontation over the war's endgame, our desperate president is reverting to his old fear-mongering habit of invoking 9/11 incessantly in every speech. The more we learn, the more it's clear that he's the one with reason to be afraid.

HEADLINE: Views Clash Among Neighbors As Builders Destroy Old for New

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

DATELINE: MASSAPEQUA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
With the chain saw man working from above and the wood chipper man working from below, removing one of the last trees on the newly cleared lot at Bay Drive and Nassau Street here took all of an hour the other day. The 75-year-old, 100-foot cedar came down in 6-foot chunks that made a slight tremor underfoot when they hit the ground. 
 ''There used to be a charming little house here on a heavily wooded lot, with pepperidge and cedar and some beech trees,'' said Kevin Kobs, a longtime resident of the neighborhood who stopped to watch the last stages of the clearing and grading of a lot bought by a home builder last year. ''They tore down the house, ripped out the trees, and now they're going to put up one of these, these ''
He grasped for the word, then pointed down the street at the plywood frame of a vast, rectangular house with big picture windows under construction. ''These monstrosities,'' Mr. Kobs said as sawdust fell on him like a light spring snow. 
 Although there are signs that things may be starting to change, for most of the last decade older suburban neighborhoods like Mr. Kobs's, an enclave called Harbour Green built on the South Shore of Long Island in the 1930s, have undergone a building boom that has divided communities.
 On one side are longtime residents who value amenities like old trees, old homes, wide lawns and the intangible qualities referred to as scale and neighborhood character; on the other side are relative newcomers who might share those values in principle but who prefer to tear down the old houses and replace them with ones sometimes twice as big.
 The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit group based in Washington, produced a survey last year indicating fierce conflicts about teardowns, as they are called by opponents -- or new construction on existing lots, as home builders call the phenomenon -- from Montclair, N.J., Delray Beach, Fla., and the Hamptons of Long Island to Atlanta, Austin, Tex., and suburban communities outside Chicago, Washington, Baltimore, Denver, Houston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Cincinnati and Boston.
 ''It's a huge phenomenon, and a very large concern of ours,'' Richard Moe, president of the organization, said in an interview. ''In the last several decades, the average size of the American home has doubled. When you inject these super-sized mansions into communities built according to an older standard, it can create enormous damage to the character of a place.''
 But there are signs of an emerging shift in this culture war of architectural taste.
 Partly as a result of the slowdown in home buying in some areas of the country, and partly because of a long-term effort by preservationists to enlist the help of local governments, a small but growing number of municipalities have imposed building moratoriums in the last two years.
 In 2005, the town council in Chevy Chase, Md., passed a six-month building moratorium while it reviewed and tightened its zoning laws in response to a protest against the construction of McMansions; the following year the Maryland Legislature adopted a bill, which was signed into law, granting broader powers to local governments to limit how high, how wide and how big in relation to surrounding homes, new houses could be.
 Similar moratoriums and zoning restrictions were adopted last year in municipalities large and small -- including Austin, Tex., Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Ocean City, N.J., Larchmont and Brighton, N.Y., and the Chicago suburbs of Evanston, Oak Park, and Naperville. 
 ''To us, we see it as a conflict between two groups that are basically well-intentioned,'' said Stephen Melman, director of research and economic forecasting for the National Association of Home Builders, a Washington-based industry lobby. ''You start with a desirable neighborhood, usually in a close-in suburb where the homes are older, and because it is such a nice place to live, it attracts your more selective clientele, who are looking for a higher-quality home.''
 The home builders association estimates there were 330,000 home demolitions in the country last year, although that includes every category, from teardowns of the Harbour Green kind to those made necessary by damage and disrepair. 
 Mr. Melman said the total was about 20 percent lower last year than in 2005, the peak year of the boom in new housing. Still, he said it was impossible to know whether that was because of building moratoriums or the general decline in new housing construction. 
 By Long Island standards, the old houses in Mr. Kobs's neighborhood, like the one just demolished along with the cedar tree, are very old. Pre-Levittown old. 
 The original 400 houses in this canal-fingered waterfront area were built from 1931 to 1940, and were among the first of their kind for middle-class homebuyers. 
 With their screened-in porches, fireplaces and steeply pitched gable roofs, Harbour Green homes were featured in magazines like ''Life'' and ''Better Homes and Gardens'' as encouraging examples of how far $4,500 could take the average person toward realizing the American Dream, a term that was then newly minted. By now, many of the original houses have been added to and renovated, but most retain the ivy-covered and tree-shaded look of the cottages they were designed to be. 
 It was about five years ago when the first of about two dozen homes here were torn down, neighbors say. In most cases, builders bought single-story houses with about 2,400 square feet of space for $600,000 to $800,000. They tore them down and built larger homes with two stories and 4,000 to 6,000 square feet of space that sold for more than $1 million. 
 Besides their size, a feature that stirred almost equal chagrin among neighbors was their height: to give the houses full-size basements on land so close to the water, builders heaped soil on the lots to raise the height of the foundation. That practice made the two-story houses seem to tower over the others, some neighbors said.
 Dan Ryan, manager of a Prudential Douglas Elliman real estate agency in Massapequa, which has been a partner in some of the new building, said it was a matter of giving customers what they wanted. 
 ''Buyers today want extra master bedrooms,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''They want dens. They want two-car garages. They want saunas. Is it the builder's fault that he builds them bigger because someone wants to buy it that way?'' 
 Beginning several years ago, Mr. Kobs, a business manager for an investment banking firm, and a nucleus of several activists including Robert Salamack, a Wall Street trader, and Mark Snider, who owns a local advertising company, convened a series of meetings among Harbour Green residents to discuss the changes in their neighborhood. They arranged meetings with Mr. Ryan, the real estate broker. 
 They called on their town councilman and on Jack Libert, a Long Island real estate lawyer who is also commissioner of planning and development in the Town of Oyster Bay, where Harbour Green is situated.
 By their account, the talks were sporadic and inconclusive until early this year, when Mr. Ryan and Mr. Libert indicated some willingness to consider their concerns. In the meantime, two things happened that may have favored the group. The real estate market slowed enough that in Harbour Green, no fewer than four new homes built by developers -- all larger than the cottages they replaced -- have gone unsold for six months to a year.
 The other factor came from the community of Oyster Bay, a hamlet on the North Shore. Last year, activists there won the support of town officials in efforts to stopthe demolition of late 19th-century and early 20th-century homes. A yearlong moratorium, which ended in January, was put in effect while the town reconsidered the rules of new construction.
 ''We recognize that this is a problem in Harbour Green,'' Mr. Libert said. ''These squarish boxes seem to be overbuilt in relation to their neighbors.''
 Mary Korber, who lives in one of the larger new houses in Harbour Green, answered her door the other day with a phone at her ear. A furniture store had failed to deliver one piece of new den furniture. Her house, on a raised foundation, has two stories, five bedrooms and a total 6,200 feet of space on a lot that once held a modest three-bedroom ranch.
 ''I have mixed feelings,'' Ms. Korber said, a hand resting on the head of one of her four children, Collin, 5. ''We moved here because we loved the charm of the neighborhood. I know people think our house is too big, but we thought it fit in. On the other hand, the land here is very expensive, and people who come here are not first-time homebuyers. They want a little more room. They have a lot of stuff.''
 Her phone rang a lot: The furniture store calling back. A brother who lives in a house nearby. A friend down the street.
 ''But I have to tell you, that house where they were taking down that tree the other day,'' she said. As it turned out, she had driven by at the same time that Mr. Kobs was watching the removal of the cedar tree at Bay Drive and Nassau Street.
 ''That was one of my favorite houses,'' she said. ''It was horrible when they knocked that down.''

HEADLINE: Bank Names Chief in Asia

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Monday, April 23 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley said Monday morning that Stephen S. Roach, the bank's chief economist, would move to Hong Kong from New York and become the chairman of its Asia operations, in the latest sign of Asia's growing economic and financial importance. 
 Mr. Roach, one of the most famous economists on Wall Street, has been increasingly gloomy about the future of the American economy, and much more optimistic about the prospects for China and India.
Mr. Roach will be in charge of handling the bank's relations with governments and clients. He has been with Morgan Stanley for 25 years and has been its chief economist for the last 16 years. He is the first economist whom the bank has named to such a senior position.

HEADLINE: American Snared in Kazakh Legal Dispute

BYLINE: By ILAN GREENBERG

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan, April 22 

 BODY:
Mark Seidenfeld, a 39-year-old American, lived for years in this booming alpine city as a prominent telecommunications executive, one of thousands of foreign businessmen who shuttled around town in chauffeured sport-utility vehicles as they managed Kazakhstan's transition from Communism to one of the most sophisticated market economies in the former Soviet Union.
 But in November 2006, he returned to Almaty bruised and exhausted after a three-week journey from Siberia in a Russian prison train after a 10-month imprisonment there.
Kazakhstan authorities had issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Seidenfeld after a Kazakh citizen accused him of siphoning $40,000 from his Almaty company, pocketing funds meant to buy a piece of machinery. After a series of postponements, preliminary hearings for Mr. Seidenfeld's criminal trial were delayed again last week for at least another month for translation of court documents. 
 An assessment in February by the Almaty office of the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and provided to The New York Times found that the equipment that Mr. Seidenfeld is accused of falsely listing on company books was located in the company's offices.
 Mr. Seidenfeld, who speaks fluent Russian and has worked most of his career in the former Soviet Union, says his troubles began when, as chief executive, he insisted on an open auction to sell his company, a Kazakhstan subsidiary of Golden Telecom, a Moscow-based Internet and telecommunications company listed on NASDAQ. Competitive bids forced Golden Telecom's sole Kazakhstan investor to raise his initial offer for the company by $5 million.
 Nearly a dozen former employees at Golden Telecom involved with the sale say Mr. Seidenfeld's insistence on the auction made him a target for retribution. Though his accuser was a Kazakh citizen, he was also an employee of Golden Telecom, which was why Mr. Seidenfeld was extradited and imprisoned in Russia. 
 Concerned that Mr. Seidenfeld's prosecution is politically motivated, several members of Congress, including Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, have lobbied American and Kazakh officials on Mr. Seidenfeld's behalf.
 ''I understand Mr. Seidenfeld's accuser is bragging he has this situation wired,'' said Representative Shelley Berkley, a Nevada Democrat, who has written to Kazakh authorities about Mr. Seidenfeld's case. ''I'm concerned that his accuser is very well connected, that he will use his contacts and his friendships to harm my constituent.'' She added that she believed the case was ''just extortion pure and simple.''
 Mr. Seidenfeld's prosecution echoes tactics used throughout the former Soviet Union to use the courts to deprive foreign investors of their assets.
 News of the case has only recently rippled through the sizable group of foreign businesspeople here, causing increasing concern at the noose that the local judicial system can swing above anyone who angers the wrong local party.
 ''If a local partner can use his influence in this country to put a foreign businessman in prison for a civil case, it creates an almost intolerable atmosphere for foreigners to invest here,'' said an American businessman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is currently involved in a large real estate project in Kazakhstan. 
 Investments by American companies and individuals make up the largest national bloc of investments in Kazakhstan, according to the State Department. 
 Mr. Seidenfeld has hired a local lawyer. Baker & McKenzie, Golden Telecom's corporate counsel, declined Golden Telecom's request to represent Mr. Seidenfeld.
 ''I think if the U.S. government is trying to have a special relationship with Kazakhstan I don't think it's a contradiction for the U.S. to say, 'Listen, we'll help you, thank you for your help with oil and Afghanistan, but in return we don't think it's ridiculous to say don't play games with our citizens,' '' Mr. Seidenfeld said in an interview from his prison cell in Almaty. ''If the Kazakhs got a message like that, I don't think my case would happen.''
 Many foreign businesspeople in Kazakhstan, a country generally perceived as the least repressive in the region, say Mr. Seidenfeld's case is part of chilling legal trend. They see it as meant to intimidate foreigners lured by Kazakhstan's booming economy and aggressive courtship of foreign investment, and say it is emblematic of Kazakhstan's rampant use of its judicial system to punish those who have failed to further the business interests of Kazakhs connected to the government.
 ''Of course we have a judicial system that can be abused,'' said Oraz Jandosov, co-chairman of Ak Zhol, an opposition political party, and the former chief of the central bank. ''Our courts are not only corrupt but competence is an issue. Not only can Americans be squeezed but vice versa. It's the natural result of the country's current political system.''
 While Mr. Seidenfeld will be the first American businessman to go on trial in Kazakhstan, his incarceration coincides with two other widely criticized criminal trials in Central Asia, provoking an outcry from human rights advocates who say the cases illustrate just how deeply the region is calcifying into a uniform authoritarian rule.
 Uzbekistan's criminal court on April 19 began considering the case of Umida Niazova, a well known Uzbek journalist and translator, on charges of illegally crossing a national border, smuggling, and ''distributing material causing public disorder.'' 
 At the same time, there have been recent high-level visits from American officials and public announcements from various European Union officials that it is considering lifting limited sanctions imposed after a violent government crackdown on civilians, some of whom were armed, in the Uzbek city of Andijon in 2005.
 Since that crackdown, regional watchdogs say, Uzbekistan has used its judicial system to silence critics, imprisoning at least 15 other journalists and activists in the past two years.
 In the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China, the son of a prominent human rights leader of the Uighur ethnic minority was sentenced last week on charges of ''instigating and engaging in secessionist activities.'' The verdict said that the man, Ablikim Kadeer, would be ''deprived of his political rights'' for three years because he wrote two newspaper articles and circulated a ''rumor'' that the Chinese authorities intended to confiscate businesses owned by his family.
 He is the son of Rebiya Kadeer, an outspoken critic of China's Uighur policies, who now lives in the United States.
 Central Asian governments keep a close eye on Chinese trials of politically active Uighurs because the political aspirations of ethnic Uighurs are widely perceived as a threat to the stability of governments across the region.
 Taken together, regional analysts say, the cases represent how Central Asian governments -- far from evolving into more transparent, business-friendly entities as many had hoped only a few years ago -- have used their courts to inoculate themselves from outside calls for reform and to outmaneuver foreign governments and businesses.
 ''Despite all the Western donor money and American-financed projects aimed at reforming the judiciaries here, this is all part of a bigger Central Asian trend to make their judicial systems subordinate to their presidents,'' said Michael Hall, an analyst in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, with the International Crisis Group, which seeks to prevent violent conflict. ''The result is a significant retreat in America's ability to project its public and business interests in the region.
 ''Plus, the U.S. has suffered a massive loss of credibility when it comes to talking about the rule of law and independent judiciaries in the wake of the abuses we've been hearing about in places like Guantanamo.''
 In addition, some critics say, the lure of Central Asia's huge oil and gas reserves has made the West reluctant to interfere in the region's internal politics. 
 ''What is not changing is the nature of these regimes,'' said Rachel Denber of Human Rights Watch, in New York. ''What is changing is the way the U.S. and the E.U. are placing value on energy, and what they perceive is the best conditions in the regions for creating the best deals on energy. They're not looking to rock the boat.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 30, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Monday about the prosecution of an American business executive in Kazakhstan on charges he stole $40,000 from his company omitted the company's name and misidentified its owners. The company is Arna Inc., and it is owned by GIMV, a Belgian investment company; the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and Murat Zhunussov, a Kazakh investor. Arna is not a Kazakhstan subsidiary of Golden Telecom, a Moscow-based Internet and telecommunications company.

HEADLINE: New Measures of Poverty

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 We applaud you for urging the Census Bureau to adopt a more realistic measure of poverty in ''Counting the Poor'' (editorial, April 17). 
The alternative recommended by the National Academy of Sciences would be a vast improvement, but even this measure grossly underestimates ''the extent to which the poor cannot afford the requisites of modern life.'' 
 Our research shows that on average, families need an income of about twice the federal poverty level, or roughly $40,000 for a family of four, to meet basic needs. In a high-cost city like New York the figure is over $50,000, whereas in the rural South the figure is in the low thirty-thousands.
 Even if the recommendation is adopted, leading to a poverty threshold of $22,841 for a family of four, the official poverty measure will still be a measure of deprivation and severe hardship rather than a minimal, decent standard below which no one should fall.

HEADLINE: Have Lenders Lost Students' Trust?

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Lenders Sought Edge Against U.S. in Student Loans'' (front page, April 15):
Like many students facing steep tuition costs, I took a student loan from the private lender Sallie Mae. Imagine how deeply betrayed and disheartened I was to discover that students like me were being taken advantage of not only by private lenders, but also by universities. 
 As a sophomore at Stanford University who depends on low-interest student loans to attend college, I am appalled that companies are offering incentives to universities to receive ''preferred lender'' status.
 As the government fails to provide adequate financing for federal and state student loans, many students are forced to turn to private lenders. And by engaging in unethical practices, universities are placing an additional hurdle in the way of middle- and low-income students trying to receive a top education. Niko Milonopoulos Stanford, Calif., April 17, 2007 To the Editor:
 ''Lenders Sought Edge Against U.S. in Student Loans'' (front page, April 15) did not mention key facts about the University of Virginia and its student loan program. 
 When we moved to the ''preferred lending'' model, it was only after a request for proposals to the lending community and an open and rigorous review. We awarded a contract because we believe it offers the greatest number of benefits to our students. 
 Neither the university nor any university employee benefits financially. At the University of Virginia, we put students and their parents first. Yvonne Hubbard Director of Student Financial Services, University of Virginia Charlottesville, Va., April 16, 2007 To the Editor:
 Lending to students is not inherently a government activity; nor is mortgage lending. The government can establish loan guarantees and financing in the public interest without becoming directly involved in such transactions. 
 Government incursions into private-sector activities should be resisted. David Ochroch Arlington, Va., April 15, 2007 The writer worked as senior director of technology procurement at Sallie Mae, 1991 to 2000. To the Editor:
 Re ''College Administrator's Dual Roles Are a Focus of Student Loan Inquiry'' (news article, April 13):
 The student loan scandal makes a mockery of college students and families struggling to pay for higher education. 
 Lenders and financial aid institutions are taking advantage of millions of students who can no longer depend on federal grant aid.
 To restore students' faith in higher education, the Higher Education Act must be reauthorized. This law, the single most comprehensive piece of higher-education legislation, can protect millions of students against gluttonous lenders and their lackeys. 
 Government oversight can also ensure that every eager, qualified student has access to higher education regardless of economic status. Jennifer S. Pae President United States Student Association Washington, April 13, 2007

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths ULTAN, DR. LESLIE

 BODY:
 ULTAN--Dr. Leslie Barry was born on November 12, 1934 in New York City as the second child and son to late parents Carl and Blanche. Dr. Ultan grew up in Bayside, New York with his parents and older brother, Lloyd, where he attended Bayside High School. 
After graduating with the Class of 1951, he attended Yale University, where he earned his Bachelor's degree in Economics and Political Science. While at Yale and on a visit home, Dr. Ultan met Susan Drezner at a sweet sixteen party for a mutual friend, and she became his beloved life partner. Following his college graduation in 1955, Dr. Ultan attended N.Y.U. School of Medicine, and he and Susan were married. After earning his medical degree in 1959, he did his internship at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York and then a residency in internal medicine at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut. Between these trainings he served his country and the U.S. Public Health Service as Heart Disease Control Officer in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He continued to pursue his life's vocation as a heart doctor with a fellowship in cardiology at Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. Dr. Ultan established his private practice in Trenton and at Helene Fuld Medical Center, where he became Chief of Cardiology, Chairman of the Coronary Care Unit and Coronary Care Committee, Director of the Non-Invasive Cardiovascular Laboratory and Trustee. A Fellow of the American College of Cardiology and Diplomate to the American Board of Internal Medicine and American Board of Cardiovascular Diseases, Dr. Ultan taught at Hahnemann and Rutgers Medical School, published medical journal articles and especially enjoyed mentoring and training paramedics and nurses in pre-hospital care of cardiac patients. Throughout his career, he was an active member of the Mercer County Heart Association, serving as President and Trustee. Frustrated with the number of heart attack patients who were dying while being transported by ambulance to the hospital, Dr. Ultan worked with others to establish in Mercer County one of the nation's first community-sponsored all-volunteer mobile intensive care unit programs. The result of their efforts was the Mercer County Lifemobile Program, which he served as founding Project Director. It has since evolved into the Capital Health System Mobile Intensive Care Unit (M.I.C.U.) and continues to bring the highest level of cardiac care equipment and paramedics and nurses trained to use it directly to patients wherever they need it. This program has saved numerous lives since its inception in 1977. Dr. Ultan was awarded a Mercer County Special Recognition Plaque in 1977 for his work helping found the Lifemobile M.I.C.U. Program and made Chairman of the New Jersey Department of Health's Advisory Committee for Mobile Intensive Care Units. He was also the recipient of Helene Fuld Medical Center's first ever Doctor of the Year Award in 1979 and their Superior Clinical Teaching Award in 1981. In 1984, he was presented with the American Heart Association's Golden Heart Award for his career work in cardiac care. Beloved by his patients and colleagues for his dedication, intelligence, wit, charm and wonderful sense of humor, Dr. Ultan had the ability to make any patient feel better just by his presence. He loved to discuss politics, sports, international relations and current events and was a lifelong New York Yankees fan (converting Susan, who wore Brooklyn Dodger blue when he met her.) He will be sorely missed by his family who survive him: wife of 511/2 years Susan, daughter Robyn, sons Robert and William, daughters-in-law Jill and Lisa and grandchildren Matthew, Emily and Sophia. Condolences can be shared with family members, who will be sitting Shiva in his memory at the family home on the evenings of Monday, April 23, 2007, and Wednesday, April 25, 2007.

HEADLINE: PC Games, Once Down, Show Signs Of Rebound

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
Navigating the aisles of a GameStop video game store in Midtown Manhattan, Bennett Kirschner passed by the latest titles for consoles like Microsoft's Xbox 360, Sony's PlayStation 2 and 3, and Nintendo's runaway hit, the Wii -- all lit and displayed like best-selling novels. 
 Instead, from a less ostentatious corner in the basement, he selected a $40 game that would play more than reasonably well on his three-year-old Dell personal computer. The game is Civilization IV, part of a series of strategy games in which a player, like a god, develops a stone-age culture into a modern one.
''When I was a kid, I used to like Nintendo and used to play on consoles,'' said Mr. Kirschner, a 28-year-old lawyer. ''But right now I don't have the time or money to invest in a $400 console and $50 in a game.'' 
 Like other gamers drawn to the PC, however, he said the attraction went beyond convenience and cost. He said computer games seem more sophisticated than console games and offer a greater sense of accomplishment. ''It's not just killing unlimited enemies on a screen,'' he said.
 Not so long ago, PC titles were the mainstay of video gaming, but they have slumped in recent years, overshadowed by a new generation of game consoles. Now they are showing signs of a comeback.
 Most prominent has been the strength of one of the most popular video games ever for PCs, World of Warcraft, a role-playing online adventure game that now has more than eight million subscribers.
 But retail sales of other titles are on the rebound as well. PC manufacturers and chipmakers are promoting the game-playing prowess of ever more powerful computers. And Microsoft has inaugurated a program aimed at making PC gaming more attractive, incorporating console-like features and easier online play. 
 There is also considerable buzz about Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, a long-awaited game due in June from id Software, the creator of the blockbuster hits Doom and Quake in the 1990s. 
 Anita Frazier, an industry analyst for the NPD Group, a market research firm, noted that in the first two months of 2007, domestic retail sales of PC games reached $203 million, a 48 percent increase over the $136.8 million in the period a year earlier. She noted that these figures do not include revenue generated by PC game sales online, or online subscriptions to play PC games. 
 ''Yes, it does look like a fluke, doesn't it?'' Ms. Frazier said. ''Rest assured it's not.'' 
 She said the bulk of this surge in sales is rooted in the role-playing video game genre that, itself, grew 43 percent over the same period last year. ''The robust performance we're seeing in PC game sales can be tied to several key titles across several genres,'' she said, ''but we'd be remiss not to address the continued success of World of Warcraft.''
 The upsurge comes after some recent reversals. Over all, retail sales of PC-based games in the United States exceeded $970 million in 2006, an increase of about 1 percent of sales the previous year of $953 million, which represented about a 14 percent drop from $1.1 billion in 2004. 
 By contrast, according to the NPD Group, retail sales for console games in 2006 were $4.8 billion; another $1.7 billion was spent on games for hand-held devices like Sony's PlayStation Portable. 
 ''I think with three consoles out in the last couple of years, it's natural to focus on consoles,'' said Todd Hollenshead, chief executive of id Software, which was a pioneer in first-person-shooter games for the PC but today makes games for PCs and consoles. ''There's a lot of excitement, a lot of marketing dollars and a lot of hype for consoles.''
 In an arena where the console makers market their wares heavily, he said, ''we don't have any champion of the PC game business to step in and leverage those sorts of marketing dollars.'' 
 But that may change with new initiatives by several companies to use PC gaming as a showcase for their technologies and services.
 Under the rubric Games for Windows, Microsoft is instituting a number of measures to raise the profile of PC games in retail stores while lowering barriers that have made buying and playing games on computers less attractive.
 Last month, it announced that it would soon extend its Xbox Live online gaming and entertainment network to include games played on PCs, a program it is calling Games for Windows -- Live. 
 And to minimize the confusion of ensuring that a particular computer has adequate graphics and processing capabilities to play a particular game, Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows Vista, is designed to evaluate any computer it is running on. 
 Based on its assessment, Vista gives the computer a ''system score.'' Under the Games for Windows program, games are assigned a score, giving shoppers an easy guide for determining if a game in the store will play well on their computer at home, said Kevin Unangst, director of global marketing for Games for Windows.
 Another move, he said, is to permit gamers who are more comfortable playing games with Xbox controllers than with keyboards and mice to use their Xbox controllers, wired and wireless (by way of a special $20 U.S.B. wireless adapter) with their PCs.
 ''One of the greatest barriers to PC gaming is user interface, controllers,'' he said.
 In the meantime, as the latest generation of consoles are among the most powerful ever made, PCs, including notebook computers, can continually outstrip consoles in sheer power and speed. Computer development cycles, the rates of adopting faster and more powerful technologies, are always much faster than those of consoles, whose core components cannot be upgraded like PCs', said Abizar Vahkaria, the worldwide head of gaming at Dell.
 ''Gaming actually started on computers and has been evolving on the PC for a very long time,'' he said, noting that Dell is deeply committed to designing and building computers that cater to gamers' needs and desires. ''What we do at Dell is work with all of the game developers and publishers and do all we can to deliver a world-class experience with gaming.''
 An example is Dell's XPS 710 H2C, a hulking desktop tower that looks as if it could have been snatched from the machined clutches of ''The Matrix.'' Under its black shell, gamers can order, for instance, super-powerful hardware like an Intel Core 2 Extreme QX6700 Quad-Core processor and Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTX graphics cards with SLi dual graphics technology. 
 The PC, which costs more than $5,000, is kept from melting into a pool of plastics and metals by a two-stage, thermoelectric-liquid-cooling system. It can also play games on an optional 20-inch high-resolution flat-panel monitor, Mr. Vahkaria said.
 Dell also owns Alienware, which along with VoodooPC (acquired last fall by Hewlett-Packard) has a reputation for computers aimed at hard-core gamers.
 This month, Hewlett-Packard executives unveiled an ambitious set of development initiatives to improve the video-game experience -- from the networks they are played over to the computers developers use to create games and the PCs players use to enjoy them.
 For now, what the company has to show are prototypes, like wrap-around display screens for gaming that resemble giant visors. But Rahul Sood, chief technology officer for Hewlett-Packard's global gaming business unit, said new products would be ready later this year.
 For computer makers, catering to gamers is more than a niche pursuit. Worldwide, where video games amount to a $36 billion industry, ''the PC is, no doubt, the gaming platform of choice,'' said Michael Arzt, senior vice president and general managerof the American office of International Cyber Marketing, the organizer of the World Cyber Games, a major video game festival. 
 And that market extends from professional gamers at high-end computers to those at more humble PCs.
 ''Not everyone wants to lay down the money for a console and a big-screen television to make it work,'' Mr. Arzt said. ''The thing about the economics of the PC,'' he added, is that ''everybody needs a computer.''

HEADLINE: Climate Change Adds New Twist to Debate Over Dams

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: KLAMATH FALLS, Ore., April 19 

 BODY:
The power company that owns four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River says the dams provide a crucial source of so-called clean energy at a time when carbon emissions have become one of the world's foremost environmental concerns.
 But the American Indians, fishermen and environmentalists who want the dams removed point to what has happened since the first one was built nearly 90 years ago: endangered salmon have been blocked from migrating, Indian livelihoods have been threatened, and, more recently, the commercial fishing industry off the Oregon and California coasts has been devastated. They say the dams are anything but clean. They say the river is a mess.
''Should we have to sacrifice water quality for air quality?'' said Craig Tucker, who is coordinating efforts by the Karuk tribe of Northern California to take down the dams. ''Should Indians and family fisherman be the ones who have to sacrifice to address this problem?'' 
 Whether the power company, PacifiCorp, wants to keep the dams because they improve air quality or simply because they are inexpensive to operate is not clear. But emphasizing an environmental argument that touches on climate change has added a new wrinkle to the longstanding debate over dam removal in the Pacific Northwest. In a region where plenty of residents measured their ''carbon footprints'' long before green became the new black, PacifiCorp is suggesting that righting one environmental wrong could lead to another, one that could affect people more than fish.
 The Klamath dams provide enough power to serve about 70,000 homes, a small fraction of PacifiCorp's 1.6 million customers, which span six Western states. But the company says only coal or natural gas are likely to be reliable enough to replace the river, which hits hydroelectric turbines four times on its way to the sea from east of the snow-capped Cascade Range.
 Those who support removing the dams largely dismiss the clean-energy argument, saying the benefits outweigh losing a relatively small source of hydropower. They note that PacifiCorp's increased interest in the environment comes as recent rulings by judges and federal fisheries agencies have given new momentum for removal. The company's federal license to run the dams expired last year, and the government has said PacifiCorp must build fish ladders over the four dams to get a new license, a proposition that could cost $300 million and reduce the power the dams generate, potentially making removal a less costly choice.
 Yet whatever is spent to restore salmon, and whether the solution is fish ladders or dam removal, the company has said that its customers will bear the cost, and the carbon.
 ''It's a conundrum in many ways,'' said Dave Kvamme, a spokesman for PacifiCorp. ''Taking away a very useful resource like the Klamath puts more pressure on us to build something else or buy it on the market.''
 The Klamath runs more than 250 miles from southwest Oregon to the California coast, connecting two states where power and water supply have long been contentious issues. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski of Oregon are helping lead the push for clean fuel sources. Last year, California passed a law requiring a 25 percent reduction in the state's carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. Oregon is also pushing to increase the amount of renewable energy it uses. 
 Both governors have said removing the Klamath dams should be an option, but they have not taken firm positions. Earlier this year, Mr. Schwarzenegger proposed spending about $4 billion to build two dams on the San Joaquin River for water storage, an idea environmentalists have long opposed.
 The Northwest, where more than 80 percent of the power generated comes from hydroelectricity, has long had some of the lowest electricity rates in the nation. It has also been the setting for epic environmental fights that reflect the tension across the region's topographic and demographic divides.
 ''We think of ourselves as ahead of the curve, as eco-topia, when it comes to saving endangered species, like the spotted owl,'' said John M. Findlay, a history professor at the University of Washington. ''But these things are much more complicated when we try to actually solve them.''
 Mr. Findlay said the region's identity as an environmental leader was rooted in cities like Portland and Seattle, not in the areas where rivers provide power and water for farms.
 ''They're the most sympathetic to taking down the dams,'' he said of big-city residents. ''But they're also the people who are kind of taking cheap power for granted. If you're in a city and you have the power just piped in over wires it's too easy to not recognize where that comes from, and not to realize that people and economies are all connected to that.''
 The Klamath dams are among the most controversial in a much broader dam removal effort led by environmentalists, American Indians and commercial fishermen. 
 In the next several years, dams on the Elwha and White Salmon Rivers in Washington and the Sandy River in Oregon are scheduled to be removed. But in many ways, they are only steppingstones to larger targets, including the dams on the Klamath and four on the Lower Snake River. 
 More fish could be saved by removing the bigger dams, but more power would be lost, too. 
 Supporters of removal say conservation measures and new sources of energy like wind and sun can replace lost hydroelectric power. Some also say the fact that snowpack is decreasing could reduce the amount of electricity dams generate. Dam owners in the region, including private utilities and the federal government, say the new sources of clean energy cannot replace dams. The use of wind power is expanding quickly, but its effectiveness depends in part on having dams or another steady energy source during lulls in the breeze.
 In a written statement last month, Bill Fehrman, the president of PacifiCorp, said replacing power from the Klamath would ''cost our customers more money, and potentially a lot more money'' and ''could result in adding combustion emissions to the environment.''
 PacifiCorp has said it is not opposed to removal, but it would need approval from regulating commissions in six states before it could pass on costs of dam removal to its customers. Blending the cost and climate change arguments could strengthen its case.
 ''We have to demonstrate to our commissions that we've done what we can to protect their interest,'' said Mr. Kvamme, the spokesman. 
 Salmon and air quality are not all that is at risk. The river and its dams support an elaborate irrigation system started by the federal government more than a century ago. Water from the river provides for about 240,000 acres of cattle pastures, alfalfa fields and other farming. It also flows through a wildlife preserve.
 When Edward Bartell and his family moved to southwest Oregon from California to raise beef cattle 30 years ago, land, water and power were inexpensive. Now, the water supply is at the mercy of an ever denser maze of environmental regulations intended to protect fish. And the price of power, delivered wholesale thanks to the Klamath dams, went through the roof when PacifiCorp said it could no longer justify the discounted rate in the current market. 
 Mr. Bartell shook his head when asked if families who moved here to farm because of the available irrigation knew such a knot could one day develop, that the dams might not last forever.
 ''It was unthinkable,'' Mr. Bartell said. ''Obviously, nobody would have come.''

HEADLINE: More Staff Cuts Expected at Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
The Tribune Company is expected to announce staffing reductions as early as today at its flagship Chicago Tribune as well as its largest-circulation newspaper, The Los Angeles Times, as revenue in the newspaper industry declines. 
 While no official announcement had been made about the cuts, reports in both newspapers late last week, citing informants they did not identify, said they were imminent and would be carried out mostly through voluntary buyout packages.
The editor of The Los Angeles Times, James O'Shea, confirmed yesterday that an announcement of cutbacks at his newspaper was to come today. 
 ''The whole industry is going through this,'' said Mr. O'Shea, reached by telephone yesterday in Washington where he had attended the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner Saturday night. ''There are staff reductions everywhere you look. Unfortunately, we aren't exempt from the laws of economic nature.''
 Many newspaper companies, including Tribune, have reduced their staffs in recent years in an effort to cut costs in response to declining revenue. A shift toward online advertising and away from print media has hurt ad sales at newspapers.
 The Chicago Tribune reported Friday that its staff was anticipating an announcement that buyout packages would be offered, with the goal of reducing the staff by about 100. 
 Mr. O'Shea said he could not provide details of anticipated reductions at The Los Angeles Times, but the newspaper had reported that the reduction was expected to involve 150 staff members, including 70 from the newsroom. That would amount to 7.6 percent of the news staff, according to a report in the paper on Saturday. 
 A spokesman for the Tribune Company, Gary Weitman, declined to comment on any planned staff reductions. 
 While revenue is down at most newspapers, the Tribune Company, whose papers also include Newsday and The Baltimore Sun, reported quarterly results last Thursday that lagged behind its peers, with a net loss of $15.6 million in the quarter and a 12 percent reduction in operating cash flow. 
 The latest round of cutbacks followed announcement early this month of a complex $8.2 billion deal in which Tribune is to be taken private at a price of $34 a share. That agreement would place the Chicago real estate magnate Samuel Zell at the helm of the company. It is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and is not expected to be made final until the end of the year. The vast debt load in that arrangement, about $13 billion, makes budget cutting even more critical. 
 Last July, the chairman of the Tribune Company, Dennis J. FitzSimons, told investors that the company planned to save $200 million in expenses over the next 24 months. 
 Further staff cutbacks at The Los Angeles Times have been rumored since the fall, when the newspaper's publisher, Jeffrey M. Johnson, and its editor, Dean Baquet, were forced out after opposing plans by the Tribune Company to cut the staff any further. Mr. Baquet is now the Washington bureau chief and an assistant managing editor for The New York Times.

HEADLINE: In Speech, McCain Intends To Push for Cap on Emissions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Saying America must be weaned from its reliance on foreign oil, Senator John McCain of Arizona is renewing his call for a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases as a way to fight global warming. 
 In the text of a speech he is scheduled to deliver today in Washington, Mr. McCain said: ''The problem isn't a Hollywood invention nor is doing something about it a vanity of Cassandra-like hysterics. It is a serious and urgent economic, environmental and national security challenge.''
Members of his campaign staff released excerpts of the speech yesterday, the last of three major addresses by Mr. McCain before the formal start later this week of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The first speech focused on why he continued to support sending more troops to Iraq, and the second involved his economic proposals.
 ''The world is already feeling the powerful effects of global warming,'' the text of the speech set for today said, ''and far more dire consequences are predicted if we let the growing deluge of greenhouse gas emissions continue, and wreak havoc with God's creation.'' 
 Mr. McCain describes energy independence as a pressing national security issue. He warns that selling oil props up Iran, which he describes as ''the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism.'' He says President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela is ''using his country's oil revenues to establish a dictatorship, bully his neighbors and succeed Castro as Latin America's leading antagonist of the United States.''
 In one excerpt from the speech, he said, ''National security depends on energy security, which we cannot achieve if we remain dependent on imported oil from Middle Eastern governments who support, or foment by their own inattention and inequities, the rise of terrorists, or on swaggering demagogues and would-be dictators in our hemisphere.''
 Mr. McCain, who has introduced legislation to lower carbon emissions, said that as president he would set ''reasonable caps'' on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and would allow companies that reduced their emissions to earn credits that they could trade for a profit.
 ''As it always does,'' Mr. McCain said, ''the profit motive will attract the transformational power of venture capital, and unleash the market to move clean alternative fuels and advanced energy technologies from the margins into the mainstream.''

 INTERNATIONAL A3-10 Sarkozy Leads French Poll; Socialist in Second Place Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative, and Segolene Royal, the Socialist, took the top spots in the first round of the presidential election. With more than 95 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Sarkozy was leading with about 30.7 percent of the vote, while Ms. Royal had about 25.2 percent. A1 Almost half of French voters over age 70 voted for the conservative candidate, Mr. 
Sarkozy. Almost 30 percent of those 18 to 24 favored the Socialist Party. Women supported Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Royal equally; men were twice as likely to vote for the far-right candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen, according to a telephone poll of registered voters. A10 U.S. Knew of China Missile Test After a Chinese interceptor smashed into a target satellite in January, Bush administration officials criticized the test. What they did not say is that as the Chinese were preparing to launch their antisatellite weapon, American intelligence agencies had issued reports about the preparations being made at the test facility in southern China. A1 Iraq Puts Stop to Work on Wall Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said he was ordering a halt to construction of a controversial wall that would block a Sunni neighborhood in Baghdad from other areas. The announcement appeared designed to allay mounting criticism from both Sunni Arab and Shiite parties. A6 Israeli Minister Investigated Israel's finance minister, Abraham Hirchson, said he was leaving office pending the outcome of a police investigation against him. The investigation involves suspicions that he embezzled funds before he joined the government, an Israeli police spokesman said. A10 9 Dead, 40 Hurt in Afghanistan Two bombings, one of them a suicide attack, rocked Khost, Afghanistan, killing 9 people and wounding more than 40, officials said. The suicide blast killed eight people and wounded at least 40, including several children, according to officials. The second bomb detonated in a video store, killing the owner and wounding seven. A3 Somalian Plight Grows Worse Government forces and insurgents in Somalia fought for a fifth straight day, killing scores of civilians and plunging the country deeper into chaos. United Nations officials say Somalia is headed toward its worst crisis ever. Estimates, at their most conservative, put the death toll from the past month near 1,000, with 200 people killed in the past week. A4 Bangladeshi Kept From Return Bangladesh's former prime minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed,was blocked from boarding a flight home from London after her country's military-backed interim government barred her from returning. A9 NATIONAL A12-16 Debate Invitations Besiege Presidential Candidates
 A flood of debate invitations is besieging Republican and Democratic candidates, thrusting them into a complicated political vortex as they struggle to balance their own needs with the demands of sensitive and powerful debate sponsors who candidates are eager not to offend. A1 Classes to Resume in Virginia Classes are scheduled to resume at Virginia Tech today, and as the campus tries to regain a sense of normalcy, professors struggle to find a sensitive way to shift the discussion back toward course work. Meanwhile, investigators are trying to solve the mystery of the motive of the gunman, Seung-Hui Cho. A14 As Korean-Americans in Centreville, Va., gathered at local churches, they embraced a time for reflection and spiritual solace after the week's jolting news that Seung-Hui Cho, who hailed from their community, had killed 32 people, and then himself, at Virginia Tech.

HEADLINE: Iraqi Premier Orders Work Stopped on Wall

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Iraqi employees of The New York Times contributed reporting from Mosul and Falluja.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, April 22 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said Sunday that he was ordering a halt to construction of a controversial wall that would block a Sunni neighborhood in Baghdad from other areas, saying it reminded people of ''other walls.'' 
 The announcement, which he made in Cairo while on a state visit, appeared intended to allay mounting criticism from both Sunni Arab and Shiite parties about the project. 
 ''I oppose the building of the wall, and its construction will stop,'' Mr. Maliki told reporters during a joint news conference with the secretary general of the Arab League, Amr Moussa. ''There are other methods to protect neighborhoods.'' 
 A spokesman for the American military, Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, said the military would remain ''in a dialogue'' with the Iraqi government about how best to protect citizens. The military did not say whether the wall's construction would be halted. 
 Mr. Maliki did not specify in his remarks what other walls he referred to. However, the separation barrier in the West Bank being erected by Israel, which Israel says is for protection but greatly angers Palestinians, is a particularly delicate issue among Arabs. 
 In Baghdad, the wall would surround the Adhamiya neighborhood, a Sunni Arab enclave bordered by Shiite areas. Adhamiya often comes under mortar attack and suffers incursions from those neighborhoods. However, it has also been a stronghold of militant Sunni Arab groups, and the wall would have helped the Iraqi security forces to control their movements. 
 Earlier on Sunday, the spokesman for the American military in Iraq sought to allay criticism of the project and explain its intent by saying that it was meant to be only a temporary barrier to improve security. 
 The military does not have a new strategy of building walls or creating ''gated communities,'' the spokesman, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, said in a written statement. He described it as a tactic being used in only a handful of neighborhoods and not an effort to divide the city, much less the country.
 However, American military officials said last week in a statement that the Adhamiya wall was ''one of the centerpieces of a new strategy.'' They also said that the wall was aimed at separating Sunni Arabs in Adhamiya from Shiites to the east. 
 Opposition to the wall has gathered steam since the news release was issued, and on Sunday, Sunni Arab and Shiite groups sharply criticized the idea. The Sunni Arab Iraqi Islamic Party and the Shiite group linked to the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr both announced that they opposed dividing Baghdad by sect. In sharp statements, they said the wall would increase sectarian hatred and fuel efforts to partition the country.
 ''Surrounding areas of the capital with barbed wire and concrete blocks would harm these areas economically and socially,'' the Islamic Party said in an e-mail message to news organizations. ''In addition, it will enhance sectarian feelings.'' 
 Abu Firas al-Mutairi, a representative of the Sadr movement in Najaf, which has supported Mr. Maliki, said: ''The Sadr movement considers building a wall around Al Adhamiya as a way to lay siege to the Iraqi people and to separate them into cantons. It is like the Berlin Wall that divided Germany.'' 
 ''This step is the first step toward dividing the regions into cantons and blockading people there,'' he added. ''Today it happens in Adhamiya. Tomorrow it will happen in Sadr City,'' referring to the Shiite slum in Baghdad that is a stronghold of Mr. Sadr. 
 The wall, which was being built as part of the security plan, had been a joint project with the Iraqi Army. The Iraqi government has the final say over how the security plan proceeds, but most policies are being intensively negotiated with the Americans, who are deploying nearly 30,000 additional troops to help secure Baghdad and the surrounding areas.
 Mr. Maliki's announcement came as sectarian violence continued across Iraq, with a horrific execution by Sunni Arabs in Mosul of 23 members of a small religious sect, known as Yezidis.
 The Yezidis, who are most numerous in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, practice an offshoot of Islam that combines some Muslim teachings with those of ancient Persian religion. 
 At least 60 people died Sunday in Iraq, with 18 killed by car bombs in Baghdad. Eleven bodies were found in the capital and five in the city of Kut, to the south. 
 But the most chilling attack was the one in Mosul. It followed the marriage in early April of a Sunni Arab man and a woman from the Yezidi faith, the police said. 
 The police said that when the woman married, she converted to Islam, which angered some of the Yezidis. She was kidnapped and as she was being brought back to her tribe, a crowd gathered and stoned her to death, said Brig. Gen. Muhammad al-Waqa of the Mosul police. 
 The Sunni Arabs in the area demanded that the Yezidis turn over the killers, and the police also put out a warrant for their arrest. In one Yezidi-majority town east of Mosul, residents found leaflets saying, ''Unless you turn them over, we will never let any Yezidi breathe the air.'' 
 The Yezidis refused. On Sunday afternoon, armed men stopped minibuses traveling from a government textile factory in Mosul, where many Yezidis and Christians were known to work. The men dragged the passengers off the buses, checked their identity cards and lined the Yezidis up against a wall and shot them, killing 23 people and wounding three, General Waqa said. 
 In Falluja, in Anbar Province, west of Baghdad, the City Council chairman, Sami al-Jumaili, was assassinated Sunday. He was the fifth council chairman in Falluja to lose his life while in the job since the war began. The militant group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has attacked those who work with the government, the police or the Iraqi Army in Anbar. 
 A relative of Mr. Jumaili who spoke anonymously because he feared retribution described him as ''an educated man who went to medical school.'' 
 ''He accepted the job because he trusts people and wanted to help the city,'' the relative said. ''Many people refused the job. The family warned him that the job was dangerous. And, many of his predecessors had been killed. He answered that he had not harmed anyone.'' 
 The American military released a statement on Sunday saying two soldiers had been killed in separate attacks on Saturday, one in Baghdad and another southwest of the capital.

HEADLINE: ON THE CAMPAIGN: The Birth of the 'Breck Girl' Story Line

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
The tale of John Edwards' $400 haircuts may have ended or at least his campaign hopes it ended when Mr. Edwards told Iowans on Friday that he was embarrassed by the episode. It arguably began four years ago this weekend with a story in The New York Times about the White House's strategy for dealing with prospective Democratic challengers to President Bush.
 In the last paragraph of that story, which I wrote with a colleague, Richard W. Stevenson, an unnamed ''Bush associate'' was quoted as referring to Mr. Edwards as ''the Breck Girl of politics.'' Another Bush adviser, again unnamed, was quoted as saying of Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, ''he looks French.'' 
In both instances, we were attempting to flesh out for readers the White House's plans for discrediting prospective Democratic opponents. Both people quoted were at the senior levels of the Bush political operation. And in both cases as Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards could certainly attest by the end of 2004 election the Bush machine had followed through on the plan it laid out 18 months earlier to define the Democrats on Republican terms.
 Our story may have had the result of not only previewing what the Bush campaign intended to do, but, by introducing such memorably biting characterizations into the political dialogue, helping it. 
 Was that a mistake on our part? Perhaps. Our goal is to give people as much information and insight as we can, in this case to help them understand what was happening in a campaign and to give them a heads-up about what to watch for. Political journalists make judgments all the time about what is and what is not newsworthy, but the bias is to err on the side of giving information to readers. 
 That said, faced with the same situation again, I would press the Bush officials to be named in offering their characterizations; no justification for anonymity here. And based on my experience in trying to insist more often that sources speak on the record in this campaign season, I think I might have succeeded.
 Still, the Bush campaign was not alone in trying to push a story line in 2004 that characterized Mr. Edwards as a pretty boy and an empty suit. Jim Jordan, who was Mr. Kerry's campaign manager during that primary, frequently referred to Mr. Edwards as ''the cute Beatle.'' (No disrespect to Paul, of course). Mr. Edwards' campaign aides knew about the efforts: they tried to defuse the attack with humor by handing out ''commemorative bottles of Breck shampoo,'' at the campaign's formal kick-off in September 2003. 
 As Mr. Edwards began his second bid for he White House, the Breck Girl story line was still out there. Its persistence reflected what Mr. Jordan and others asserted were reservations about Mr. Edwards among voters as well as vulnerabilities that his opponents have always tried to exploit.
 As anyone who has interviewed Mr. Edwards, or seen him this year talking with voters about, say, his health care plan, the lightweight label seems unfair, whatever you think of his politics. Voters routinely walk away from such events describing him as a substantial candidate immersed in serious issues.
 But last week, as the story of the haircuts reverberated across Iowa and New Hampshire, on to the Drudge Report and finally to both David Letterman and Jay Leno, it was a reminder that, fair or not, this remains a persistent vulnerability for Mr. Edwards. To the frustration of some of his own supporters, it is one that he and his campaign have at times played into through elementary mistakes that underlined the image he is trying to dispel.
 In one memorable moment, Mr. Edwards was captured on videotape waiting for an interview to begin; the tape shows him and his make-up artist fret with his hair for nearly two minutes.
 Rule No. 1 of politics in this era of YouTube: if you are sitting in front of a camera, assume it is rolling. This clip was posted on YouTube, to the tune of ''I Feel Pretty,'' last November. It had been viewed nearly 362,000 times as of Monday morning, and in another indication of why the haircut and attendant publicity was so unwelcome in the Edwards camp nearly 80,000 times over the six days since news of the haircut expenditure first started getting wide circulation, based on campaign expenditure reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.
 An episode like this would have been a problem in his last campaign, for the all the obvious reasons. It had particular resonance again this time because of the effort Mr. Edwards has made to position himself as a populist champion of the middle- and working classes at a time of growing economic disparity. His target audience is not the $400-haircut voter.
 As one of Mr. Edwards' advisers said over the weekend, his campaign organization failed the candidate here. Campaigns routinely scrutinize the list of their own expenditures to weed our precisely these kind of items before an opponent does it for them; in this case, the haircuts were supposed to have been paid for by Mr. Edwards personally (if he had paid out of his own pocket from the start, there would have been no requirement to disclose the cost) rather than having them paid for by the campaign (campaign expenditures are a matter of public record).
 But the reaction from voters suggest that it was not a matter of who paid for it; it was the simple fact of a $400 haircut. A reporter for the Quad City Times in eastern Iowa surveyed barbers for their reaction in a part of the state where haircuts go for $10 to $12 a pop. From the story: ''''If I charged $400 for a haircut, they'd come after me with white coats,'' said Leo Fier, who has been cutting hair for 49 years at his shop in DeWitt, Iowa.''
 Surely it was not a coincidence that one of Mr. Edwards' rivals, Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, invited a photographer in on Friday to shoot him as he was getting a $12 haircut at Dude's Barber Shop in Manchester on Friday. That photo was featured on the front page of the Union Leader.
 Mr. Edwards' advisers argued over the weekend that the financial circumstances of his life he became wealthy as a trial lawyer should not detract from the sincerity of his message, or the depth of his concern about issues of poverty.
 Still, appearances matter in politics, and four years after the Breck Girl line first appeared in print, Mr. Edwards continues to have trouble leaving it behind.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Draws a 25-Year Blueprint for a Greener City

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In a quarter-century plan to create what he called ''the first environmentally sustainable 21st-century city,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed a sweeping and politically contentious vision yesterday of 127 projects, regulations and innovations for New York and the region.
 The plan is intended to foster steady population growth, with the city expected to gain about 1 million residents by 2030, and to put in place a host of environmentally sensitive measures that would reduce the greenhouse gases it generates.
Mr. Bloomberg also set the parameters for what could be a large piece of his legacy as mayor. In an address outlining the plan yesterday at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, Mr. Bloomberg likened it to the first blueprints for Central Park more than 100 years ago and the construction of Rockefeller Center in the Great Depression. 
 Many elements of the plan will face political hurdles in Albany and will depend on huge financial commitments from the state and federal governments, not to mention future mayors. To start, Mr. Bloomberg intends to add hundreds of millions of dollars to his proposed $57 billion budget for the next fiscal year, his aides said yesterday. 
 ''Our economy is humming, our fiscal house is in order and our near-term horizon looks bright,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''If we don't act now, when?''
 The mayor chose Earth Day to give his speech and to release the details of his proposals. As widely predicted, the plan calls for an $8-a-day charge for people who drive their cars into Manhattan below 86th Street. The proposal for ''congestion pricing,'' which City Hall believes would reduce traffic and auto emissions while raising money for transportation projects, has already been met by harsh criticism from drivers and some officials outside Manhattan.
 Other proposals in the plan, dubbed PlaNYC by the mayor's staff, range from building huge capital projects and creating government authorities to implementing relatively benign initiatives in housing, transportation and land use.
 One proposal calls for investments of $200 million a year from both the city and state to create a financing authority that would assure the completion of major projects like the Second Avenue subway. New authorities, with representatives from the city, state and private industry, would push for improved energy efficiency in new buildings and for the replacement of energy-guzzling power plants.
 The city also would encourage the construction of platforms over railyards and highways to create land for housing. In addition, the plan would open 290 schoolyards as playgrounds, eliminate city sales taxes on energy-efficient hybrid vehicles, increase the number of bike paths and cultivate mussels to suck pollution out of the rivers. 
 Much of the plan, including its most costly proposals, would require state approval. Gov. Eliot Spitzer did not attend Mr. Bloomberg's address, although another governor -- Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who appeared via videotape on two large screens -- introduced the mayor. 
 Governor Spitzer, in a brief statement released late yesterday, said: ''The mayor has released a comprehensive plan with admirable goals, especially the commitment to reduce energy consumption, and we look forward to reviewing the plan.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's initiative could be vulnerable to changes at City Hall and to setbacks in the economy.
 But several observers praised it as a much-needed master plan for growth and the environment in a city that has let too many decades pass without such a vision.
 ''How you follow through on this is a huge political question, but it is a good time to be pushing it,'' said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Committee. Ms. Fortuna was among several hundred people invited to the mayor's speech, many of them associated with the 150 advocacy groups that had provided recommendations to Mr. Bloomberg. 
 The mayor acknowledged that the proposal for congestion pricing was the most contentious, calling it ''the elephant in the room.''
 Under the plan, the city would charge $8 for cars and $21 for commercial trucks that enter Manhattan below 86th Street from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays. The charge would be $4 for drivers within Manhattan, and several exemptions would apply. No one would be charged on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive or the West Side Highway. There would be no charge for moving cars to comply with alternate side parking, and there would be no charge for taxis. 
 A similar system is in place in congested parts of London and Singapore, where Mr. Bloomberg said it had been shown to reduce congestion and improve air quality. In Manhattan, cameras and other equipment at intersections would deduct money from a driver's E-ZPass account or photograph a car's license plate, with the driver given two days to pay the fee through the mail, online or at certain stores. 
 The city said yesterday that it intended to seek state approval for a three-year test of congestion pricing and would need to spend $225 million to buy and install traffic-recording equipment. Officials said the city and state could jointly apply for grants from the United States Department of Transportation to cover those costs.
 ''The federal government really does want to be helpful,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, in a rare departure from his prepared text. 
 Later, Mary E. Peters, the United States secretary of transportation, issued a statement praising the plan as ''the kind of bold thinking leaders across the country need to embrace if we hope to win the battle against traffic congestion.'' 
 The Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, who has many constituents who commute by car to Manhattan, also was enthusiastic. ''People's first reaction is they don't want to pay,'' he said. ''But getting them to switch to mass transit benefits us all.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg also called for improvements in express bus service and other public transportation in neighborhoods with little access to the subway, and where people are most inclined to drive into Manhattan for work or shopping. He said the city would complete those improvements before anyone is charged in the congestion pricing system. 
 Still, the reaction of many officials from outside Manhattan was cool. ''I wonder if it is another hidden tax on working people,'' said Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president. ''I worry about people who need to use their cars to get to work.'' 
 Money raised through congestion pricing would be added to the $400 million a year in combined city and state funds that the plan seeks for the creation of a new financing authority for transportation projects. The Sustainable Mobility and Regional Transportation Authority would issue bonds to award matching grants for projects by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and other agencies.
 Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday that the added financial muscle was needed to close a $31 billion funding gap in 18 projects that are planned or underway, including the Second Avenue subway.
 The new authority would be governed by a board with equal representation from the city and state. But it could provide a mechanism for Mr. Bloomberg and future mayors to reclaim some power over planning and capital expenditures by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It is also a joint city and state agency, but one that has often been dominated by appointees of the governor.
 In a prepared statement yesterday, officials from the authority said: ''We applaud the mayor's commitment to the transit system and will carefully analyze the city's proposal to understand its impact on the M.T.A.''
 Two other authorities, a New York City Energy Planning Board and an Energy Efficiency Authority, would be created to marshal investments that would finance energy conservation efforts and the construction of efficient power plants.
 The plan also calls for a surcharge on electrical power customers, averaging $2.50 a month, with the money used to finance grants and other incentives for retrofitting buildings with energy-efficient materials. The new energy planning board, governed by city and state officials and utility executives, would make long-term commitments to buy energy from companies or investors who build efficient power plants. 
 In another measure, the city would plant more than 1 million trees in the next 10 years. It would offer incentives -- intended to capture storm water runoff -- for larger and deeper sidewalk tree pits and green roofs. 
 The plan calls for zoning changes in many neighborhoods with access to public transportation that would allow for larger homes and a higher density of housing, although such changes are often resisted in those neighborhoods. 
 It pledges that every New Yorker would live within a 10-minute walk from a park, and it calls for small public plazas in each community board district that does not have a park.
 It would replace or modernize diesel-powered school buses in the city fleet and offer incentives to get heavy diesel trucks off the road. And it would commit city funds to clean up 7,600 acres of so-called brownfields, where soil has been polluted by chemicals or industrial materials. Some of the land would become parks.
 Besides the introduction by Governor Schwarzenegger, Mr. Bloomberg's address yesterday included videotaped praise by Tony Blair, the British prime minister, who made it clear the initiative was capturing the imagination of urban planners -- if not necessarily the support it will need in Albany, Washington and neighborhoods outside Manhattan.
 ''This would mark out New York as a global leader in halting climate change,'' Mr. Blair said.

(Photographs by James Estrin/The New York Times)(pg. B4) Chart: ''The Plan for 2030'' During his Earth Day address, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg released a plan for a ''greener, greater New York,'' with 127 proposals covering six areas. Examples large and small include: LAND Rezone in neighborhoods near public transportation to create 265,000 new homes. Ensure that residents live within a 10-minute walk to a park by opening schoolyards as playgrounds and reclaiming sites that were once designated as parks. Accelerate the cleanup of 7,600 acres of contaminated sites. TRANSPORTATION Reach a ''state of good repair'' on the city's roads, subways and railways. Create a bus rapid transit program with super express buses that would run in dedicated lanes. Run a pilot program that charges commuters to drive into Manhattan on weekdays, and use these ''congestion pricing'' funds for transit projects. WATER Provide incentives to building owners to recycle water for non-potable uses like flushing the toilet. Develop 40 ''Greenstreets'' projects every planting season over 25 years to expand storm water storage. Increase the city's trees by one million. ENERGY Provide cleaner, more reliable power by upgrading the energy infrastructure and retiring dirty power plants. Reduce energy use by encouraging the largest consumers to increase energy efficiency. Add a surcharge to electric bills to finance incentives for retrofitting buildings. AIR QUALITY Require the use of higher grades of fuel oil to heat businesses, schools and homes. Waive the city sales tax on hybrid vehicles. CLIMATE CHANGE Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent. Develop citywide and community plans for adapting to the consequences of climate shifts, including rising seas and intensifying storms.

HEADLINE: State's Back At the Table In Planning Downtown

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer's appointment last week of two top officials to a development corporation that had been considered all but dead appears to set the stage for yet another power struggle at ground zero.
 In a way it also seems to be a rebuke for the city's recent solo announcement that the Joyce Theater would be the sole occupant of a performing arts center planned for the former World Trade Center site. Many of those involved in planning Lower Manhattan now wonder whether the center, to be designed by Frank Gehry, will become the focus of a long tug of war. 
The revival of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation is perhaps the clearest sign that the Spitzer administration is determined to take back the reins, or at least strengthen its grip, on the center. Having chosen a master plan and a memorial design and allocated federal money for cultural programs, the development corporation said last summer that its work was done. The agency had already been defanged by George E. Pataki, then the governor; he had bowed to criticism from relatives of 9/11 victims and eliminated the Drawing Center and an International Freedom Center from the site. Yet last Monday Governor Spitzer announced that he had appointed Avi Schick as chairman of the development corporation and David Emil as president. Mr. Schick is also president of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development agency, and served as a deputy attorney general under Governor Spitzer, who was then attorney general. Mr. Emil owned Windows on the World, the restaurant at the top of the World Trade Center, and is a former president of the Battery Park City Authority.
 The same day, at a City Council committee hearing on the performing arts center, Mr. Schick made clear that the development corporation was coming back strong. ''L.M.D.C. will be the vehicle through which Governor Spitzer expresses his vision and articulates his voice in Lower Manhattan,'' he said. ''With new leadership and new direction, a reinvigorated L.M.D.C. will help revitalize an area that is important not only to New Yorkers but to all Americans.''
 For City Council members Mr. Schick's message was unambiguous. ''The state made it clear they are not delegating this issue to the city,'' said Councilman Alan J. Gerson, chairman of the council's Committee on Lower Manhattan Redevelopment, which held the hearing.
 Over the past year most of the development corporation's responsibilities have been assumed by other players. The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation had taken over planning for the memorial and a memorial museum. The city picked up the cultural component, seeking a new home for the Drawing Center and deciding that it would be too costly -- an estimated $700 million -- for the performing arts center to house both the Joyce and the Signature Theater. 
 The city announced last month that the center would be occupied solely by the Joyce, which presents dance, and that the Signature, an Off Broadway theater, would seek to relocate to nearby Fiterman Hall, part of the City University of New York. ''The Pataki administration didn't stand up to the role at all,'' said Tom Healy, president of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. ''He abdicated it, and the city stepped in.'' 
 But Mr. Schick's testimony makes clear that the state is back in the picture when it comes to the performing arts center. In view of costs and the overall state of construction at ground zero, Mr. Schick told the panel, the situation ''mandates that we return to the drawing board.'' 
 Mr. Schick said that planners needed to identify sources of funds and determine a governance structure for the performing arts center. Any budget must also acknowledge that construction of the center cannot begin until 2011 because of a temporary PATH train exit at the site, he told the committee.
 Still, Mr. Schick also emphasized that the Spitzer administration was committed to ''the establishment of vibrant cultural institutions in Lower Manhattan,'' and that it would work with the city to make the performing arts center a reality.
 ''Done right, a performing arts center will be a beautiful and meaningful addition to the cultural fabric of this city, a welcome and necessary addition to the life of Lower Manhattan and a potent salve that will erase the scars left by Sept. 11,'' he said.
 When Governor Spitzer took office in January, some critics of the master plan for ground zero hoped that he would seize the opportunity to cancel construction of the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower. He had previously referred to it as an unattractive ''white elephant'' and expressed doubts that it would draw enough tenants. 
 But Governor Spitzer announced in February that while it was not the tower he would have wanted, he would support its continued construction.
 The performing arts center, on the other hand, is one of the few remaining projects at the site that is still in the planning stages, which affords the governor an opportunity to exert his influence. 
 Officials at the affected arts organizations say they hope the expanded cast of characters will not mean more delays. ''They're the new players,'' said Linda Shelton, executive director of the Joyce Theater. ''I hope they follow the direction that the city is going in.''
 Yet even some cultural advocates are urging public officials to question whether a performing arts center makes economic sense at ground zero. ''I'm not a believer that, given its current scale and cost, it's a wise investment that we can afford,'' Mr. Healy said. ''There is no cachet to being there if the building can't be built, or if the building is built and no one can afford to run it.''
 Still unclear is who will be responsible for raising money for the institution. The city has estimated its cost -- together with that of creating three theaters for the Signature at Fiterman Hall -- at $350 million. 
 Through the development corporation the state has committed $55 million to the performing arts component at ground zero, but only for organizations that are specifically on the site. As a result the city said it expected to make its contributions to the Signature project through the city's capital budget.
 The memorial foundation's mandate originally included raising money for an arts center, but that was abandoned in favor of concentrating on the memorial. The foundation's $350 million goal is now in sight; Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Tuesday that more than $165 million had been raised over the last six months, bringing the total so far to more than $300 million. Whether the foundation is willing to take up the performing arts center next remains an open question. 
 In an interview Mr. Schick said the state had no interest in overpowering the city on ground zero, nor in refighting old battles. ''It's not that the city's role will be diminished, but that we will be an active partner working alongside them,'' he said. ''We're here. We have a presence. For projects like these, we're going to be part of the conversation.''
 ''We're not going to revisit things that, for better or worse, have been decided,'' he added. ''On the other hand there is a lot that still has to be knit together if we are going to deliver the revitalized Lower Manhattan we have promised.''
 There were practical reasons for delaying the demise of the development corporation. Congressional legislation established it as a conduit for federal grants for ground zero from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. But the corporation was also a big symbol of state involvement. 
 With Mayor Bloomberg now serving as chairman of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, some of those involved say, Governor Spitzer saw the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation as a possible counterweight. While it was created as a city-state agency, it is a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation and has always been dominated by the state. The Lower Manhattan corporation also includes the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which tips the balance toward the governor. 
 What is more, Governor Spitzer, having just taken office, can play a role at ground zero until January 2011 -- or until 2015 if he wins a second term. Mayor Bloomberg must step down at the end of 2009. ''We will have a new mayor,'' said Madelyn Wils, a longtime director of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. ''It's an opportunity for the governor to make his mark. He'll be the only one around.''
 Some officials involved in rebuilding in Lower Manhattan, insisting on anonymity, say that Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, is distressed by the reinsertion of another strong player in the planning. But in a telephone interview Mr. Doctoroff said he welcomed Mr. Emil and Mr. Schick at the table. ''What I'd be more concerned about is if the state were not playing an active role,'' he said. ''We have to work together.''
 ''However the state wants to manage its involvement in Lower Manhattan is perfectly fine with us,'' he added.

HEADLINE: The Greater (and the Lesser) Considered at the Ad Summit

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla. 

 BODY:
Here is a look back at some of the highlights, lowlights and sidelights of the 2007 management conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, known as the Four A's, which was held here last Wednesday through Friday. GIMME A 'D'? -- Before his speech to the conference on Thursday, Howard Draft, chairman and chief executive at Draft FCB, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, spoke with Andrew McMains, a reporter for the trade publication Adweek, about his agency's performance in the annual Agency Report Cards issue, which came out last week.
 Needless to say, Mr. Draft was not thrilled that Draft FCB had received a grade of C minus over all and a grade of D for how the agency was managed in 2006. 
 ''The last time I got a D was in high school,'' Mr. Draft told Mr. McMains, ''and that was when I wasn't going to class.'' THE GRIPES OF ROTH -- Each year, the Four A's tries to schedule a speaker who is the chairman or the chief executive, or both, of one of the giant holding companies that own many of its member agencies. This year, filling that slot was Michael I. Roth, chairman and chief at Interpublic.
 Mr. Roth described how he led insurance companies like the Mony Group before taking over the helm at Interpublic.
 ''I was your typical client,'' Mr. Roth said, in that ''I guess you could say I was a pain.'' 
 Actually, Mr. Roth said, he is not new to advertising, having spent ''35 years in the industry'' -- only it was ''all crammed into two years.'' His rueful reference was to his work to solve the myriad financial and operational difficulties that have hampered Interpublic's performance. SAY WHAT? -- When advertising executives speak at conferences before their peers, jargon tends to creep into their remarks.
 For instance, Mr. Roth in his speech urged the audience to ''break down the silos'' that keep different disciplines within agencies from working together and that impede the development of ''holistic solutions'' to clients' problems.
 At another point, Mr. Roth suggested that ''interdependence'' was ''the way to deliver the holistic offering.'' 
 And in explaining why certain campaigns resonated with consumers in the last year, Susan Gianinno, chairwoman and chief executive at Publicis USA, part of the Publicis Worldwide division of the Publicis Groupe, praised them for ''linking and integrating experiences across interconnection points to deepen and broaden involvement.'' SO LONG, FAREWELL -- The conference was likely to be the last one to be presided over by O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive at the Four A's. Mr. Drake, 65, intends to retire at the end of the year, he said, after leading the association since January 1994. A committee has been named to oversee the search for a successor, working with a consultant, Gilbert & Partners.
 ''It's a good time for me to be moving on,'' Mr. Drake said. ''The hope is to have my replacement on board in early 2008.''
 Mr. Drake listed among his accomplishments leading the organization through two recessions, the dot-com bust and the ''ongoing predictions in the press that the advertising agency business is doomed.'' 
 Among the issues that face the industry, Mr. Drake cited ''attracting and retaining the right talent'' as paramount, particularly minority employees, because ''diversity in the ranks of ad agencies still has a very long way to go.''
 There was no formal send-off for Mr. Drake at the conference. Rather, he is to be ''roasted'' at the Friars Club in September, during Advertising Week in New York.
 ''I did agree'' to it, Mr. Drake said, laughing. ''I don't know what I was thinking.'' AT A CROSSROADS -- The choice of a successor to Mr. Drake is expected to help set a course for the Four A's for years to come as the organization seeks to remain relevant while sweeping changes remake the industry.
 Some executives involved in the search said they hoped to hire a chief executive with a background in the fastest-growing parts of the business, like digital advertising and new media. The executives spoke on the condition of anonymity because the search process is getting under way.
 The executives also said they would be pleased if the age of the next chief executive began with a ''3'' or ''4'' rather than a ''5'' or ''6.'' Their most ambitious goal of all: hiring the first woman, black or Hispanic to lead the Four A's. BRAND LAND -- Each year, sponsors help the Four A's defray the cost of the conference. They are usually media companies hoping to catch the attention of the senior agency managers who attend the event.
 At the first conference over which Mr. Drake presided, in 1994, sponsors included the Big Three broadcast television networks, he recalled. But now ABC, CBS and NBC are gone, replaced by ''MSN, Google, AOL and Yahoo, among others,'' he said.
 ''In these days of clutter in advertising, there's a lot of clutter in our sponsors,'' Mr. Drake said, ''but we do appreciate their support.''
 Actually, as conference clutter goes, the 12 sponsors were not that many. By comparison, the conference last October of the organization that is the counterpart to the Four A's, the Association of National Advertisers, had 51 sponsors. 
 Attendees at the Four A's conference could drink coffee and tea at the breakfasts from oversize china cups bearing the Yahoo logo. Google set up six PCs. And at one reception, AOL, part of Time Warner, gave away cigars made of tobacco or chocolate.
 Perhaps the most visible sponsor was the Microsoft Digital Advertising Solutions division of Microsoft, which sells ads for units like MSN and the Xbox video game system.
 The division had an elaborate sand sculpture built on the beach at the opening reception Wednesday night, and bought ad space on the plastic key cards attendees used at the conference hotel.

HEADLINE: If Checker Cabs Could Fly: Hop In, the Meter's Running

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
Email: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE idea of cheap little jets that resembled sport utility vehicles and could be produced by the thousands seemed far-fetched -- and some even said preposterous -- when the two pioneers in the field, Eclipse Aviation, in Albuquerque, and Adam Aircraft, near Denver, were gearing up for production six years ago.
 Edward E. Iacobucci was an early believer. He had worked for I.B.M. for 11 years before founding a software company, Citrix Systems. 
 He was retired in 2001, when he ran into Vern Raburn, a former Microsoft executive and founder of Eclipse who was developing a little five-passenger jet with a price tag of $875,000. 
 ''What really interested me more than this notion of 'an airplane in every garage' that some people were talking about was the notion that you can mass produce these things at such a low price,'' Mr. Iacobucci said. ''Vern told me he wanted to be the Henry Ford of aviation.''
 Mr. Iacobucci, now 53, gave this some thought and decided that if Mr. Raburn could be Henry Ford, he could be Checker Cab. 
 That was the beginning of DayJet, a company based in Delray Beach, Fla., that recently took delivery of its first three Eclipse 500 jets. The company plans to begin flying the nation's first on-demand, per seat air taxi service in June. DayJet, with $68 million in equity capital, has so far ordered 239 Eclipse 500 jets (each one selling for $1.5 million).
 Competitors who are considering getting into the air taxi business will be watching carefully. DayJet plans to operate at first in a few regional markets in Florida. By fall, DayJet expects to be flying between 10 secondary airports with 35 jets, and by the end of the year, it expects to have as many as 15 routes and 50 aircraft.
 The keys to the business are ''on-demand'' and ''per seat.'' Air taxis, Mr. Iacobucci said, will open a new market in business aviation, mostly to people who now drive on business trips of 300 or so miles. It is also hoping to attract business travelers who now fly from, say, Gainesville, Fla., to Pensacola, Fla., on commercial airlines that route them through a hub like Atlanta.
 Skeptics insist that you can't make money running an airplane on demand like a taxi because of the economics and the enormously complicated logistics. 
 Mr. Iacobucci acknowledges that it is very complicated logistically.
 ''We are providing a service that never existed before,'' he said, ''so you get into all sorts of things like value networks and viral marketing that help us identify not just the city but which combination of cities works best'' to find on-demand passengers. ''You have to balance demand and supply in a world where you don't know what demand is.''
 I nodded and made notes. Somewhere deep, I had a sinking feeling similar to those I vaguely recalled from college economics courses.
 How does this work? I asked.
 ''Think of it as a time arbitrage system,'' he said.
 I tried.
 ''The value of a leg from A to B, well, you can quote that in a myriad of ways that involve how you value your time,'' he said. ''If it takes an hour to fly from Boca to Gainesville, and I as a customer say, 'I can't leave any earlier today than 9 a.m. and have to be there by 10:30' that's going to be an expensive ticket, maybe close to $4 a mile, because chances are I am not going to get enough other people to converge with you.
 ''But our technology lets people game the system, until they find the point -- say, try 9:30 or try 7:30 a.m. -- where they feel comfortable with the price matching the value received.''
 How much does it cost? It depends.
 It costs about $600 each way to fly between Florida cities, through Atlanta. It costs about the same to fly directly from Fort Lauderdale to Tallahassee, he said. But there's only one flight a day. ''Our price for Fort Lauderdale to Tallahassee may not beat that every time, but it can range from between $300 and $1,000 each way, depending on your value of your time,'' he said.
 In general, Mr. Iacobucci said, fares will average about the same as unrestricted coach fares on commercial airlines. 
 I was still hanging in there. 
 ''Every reservation that comes in,'' he said, ''is an opportunity to find a better solution, which is the essence of complexity science.''
 By definition, an air taxi cannot be on a schedule, he went on, adding: ''The minute you nail something down and build a schedule, you're eliminating options. Don't make a decision until you have to. That is what it is all about.''
 I thought I would show that part to my wife and my editor, both of whom think I should plan ahead better. The phrase ''time arbitrage'' will be most useful. 
 Meanwhile, I'm test-flying one of Mr. Iacobucci's taxis next month. I'll let you know how I fare.

HEADLINE: Time Warner Broadband Deal To Allow Users to Share Access

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
In a victory for a small Wi-Fi start-up called Fon, Time Warner will let its home broadband customers turn their connections into public wireless access spots, a practice shunned by most Internet service providers in the United States. 
 For Fon, which has forged similar agreements with service producers across Europe, the deal will bolster its credibility with American consumers. For Time Warner, which has 6.6 million broadband subscribers, the move could help protect the company from an exodus as free or inexpensive municipal wireless becomes more readily available.
Fon was founded in Spain in 1995 on the premise that people should not have to pay twice -- once at home, then again in a public space -- for Internet access. At first, the company offered software that let members, called Foneros, turn Wi-Fi routers into shared access points, but it took hours to get up and running.
 Last fall, Fon, which counts Google among its investors, started selling and sometimes giving away its own branded wireless router, called La Fonera. Since then, it has distributed about 370,000 worldwide.
 La Fonera splits a Wi-Fi connection in two: an encrypted channel for the Fonero and a public one for neighbors or passers-by. Foneros can decide how much of their bandwidth to share with the public and can log on to any Fon router without charge. Users who do not have Fon can register on a Web page and pay $2 or $3 for 24 hours of access.
 In the United States, where it costs $10 for a day pass to use a T-Mobile HotSpot at a Starbucks, Fon's economics seem particularly appealing.
 Starbucks and T-Mobile USA representatives responded that they provide a premium service, and that customers see value in paying for speed, security and reliability.
 Until now, Internet service providers in the United States have resisted the Fon model. Most big companies' end-user license agreements prohibit subscribers from sharing their connection outside the home or business. Verizon Communications, for example, can terminate contracts if it finds an ad hoc hot spot.
 Fon agues that those policies do not mesh with the reality of untold thousands of people using their neighbors' unsecured Wi-Fi connections.

HEADLINE: Propeller Puzzles

BYLINE: By C. CLAIBORNE RAY

 BODY:
 Q. I have heard of planes with five-bladed propellers. How do engineers decide how many blades to have? A. The number of blades is but one choice an engineer designing propellers must make, and the others may be just as important or even more so, said Alan J. Friedman, consulting senior scientist for the New York Hall of Science in Queens. 
''The shape of each section of the blades, their thickness, length, pitch -- which is often changeable in flight -- can all be varied,'' he said. ''Those choices in turn depend on many factors, such as how much power the engine produces, what rotation speed is optimum, how fast the plane will be going most of the time and how high (hence how thin the air), how much noise and vibration are tolerated, speed versus economy, and on and on.''
 The famous Spitfire fighter of World War II, for example, had two-, three-, four- or five-blade propellers, each chosen for various models of the plane and engine. ''And there are even more options,'' Dr. Friedman said. ''Some planes have contra-rotating propellers, two propellers on the same shaft, but turning in opposite directions.''
 Each factor is just one variable in a complex design equation. ''There is rarely one ideal answer,'' Dr. Friedman said. ''Instead, finding the right compromise for each situation is the nature of the game.'' C. CLAIBORNE RAY

HEADLINE: Terror In the Weather Forecast

BYLINE: By Thomas Homer-Dixon. 
Thomas Homer-Dixon, director of the Trudeau Center for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Toronto, is the author of ''The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization.''

DATELINE: Toronto 

 BODY:
DOES climate change threaten international peace and security? The British government thinks it does. As this month's head of the United Nations Security Council, Britain convened a debate on the matter last Tuesday. One in four United Nations member countries joined the discussion -- a record for this kind of thematic debate. 
 Countries rich and poor, large and small, and from all continents -- Bangladesh, Ghana, Japan, Mexico, much of Europe and, most poignantly, a large number of small island states endangered by rising seas -- recognized the security implications of climate change. Some other developing countries -- Brazil, Cuba and India and most of the biggest producers of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide, including China, Qatar and Russia -- either questioned the very idea of such a link or argued that the Security Council is not the right place to talk about it. 
But these skeptics are wrong. Evidence is fast accumulating that, within our children's lifetimes, severe droughts, storms and heat waves caused by climate change could rip apart societies from one side of the planet to the other. Climate stress may well represent a challenge to international security just as dangerous -- and more intractable -- than the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the cold war or the proliferation of nuclear weapons among rogue states today.
 Congress and senior military leaders are taking heed: Legislation under consideration in both the Senate and the House calls for the director of national intelligence to report on the geopolitical implications of climate change. And last week a panel of 11 retired generals and admirals warned that climate change is already a ''threat multiplier'' in the world's fragile regions, ''exacerbating conditions that lead to failed states -- the breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism.''
 Addressing the question of scientific uncertainty about climate change, Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, a former Army chief of staff who is now retired, said: ''Speaking as a soldier, we never have 100 percent certainty. If you wait until you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to happen on the battlefield.''
 In the future, that battlefield is likely to be complex and hazardous. Climate change will help produce the kind of military challenges that are difficult for today's conventional forces to handle: insurgencies, genocide, guerrilla attacks, gang warfare and global terrorism.
 In the 1990s, a research team I led at the University of Toronto examined links between various forms of environmental stress in poor countries -- cropland degradation, deforestation and scarcity of fresh water, for example -- and violent conflict. In places as diverse as Haiti, Pakistan, the Philippines and South Africa, we found that severe environmental stress multiplied the pain caused by such problems as ethnic strife and poverty.
 Rural residents who depend on local natural resources for their livelihood become poorer, while powerful elites take control of -- and extract exorbitant profits from -- increasingly valuable land, forests and water. As these resources in the countryside dwindle, people sometimes join local rebellions against landowners and government officials. In mountainous areas of the Philippines, for instance, deforestation, soil erosion and depletion of soil nutrients have increased poverty and helped drive peasants into the arms of the Communist New People's Army insurgency.
 Other times, people migrate in large numbers to regions where resources seem more plentiful, only to fight with the people already there. Or they migrate to urban slums, where unemployed young men can be primed to join criminal gangs or radical political groups. 
 Climate change will have similar effects, if nations fail to aggressively limit carbon dioxide emissions and develop technologies and institutions that allow people to cope with a warmer planet.
 The recent report of Working Group II of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identifies several ways warming will hurt poor people in the third world and hinder economic development there more generally. Large swaths of land in subtropical latitudes -- zones inhabited by billions of people -- will experience more drought, more damage from storms, higher mortality from heat waves, worse outbreaks of agricultural pests and an increased burden of infectious disease.
 The potential impact on food output is a particular concern: in semiarid regions where water is already scarce and cropland overused, climate change could devastate agriculture. (There is evidence that warming's effect on crops and pastureland is a cause of the Darfur crisis.) Many cereal crops in tropical zones are already near their limits of heat tolerance, and temperatures even a couple of degrees higher could lead to much lower yields.
 By weakening rural economies, increasing unemployment and disrupting livelihoods, global warming will increase the frustrations and anger of hundreds of millions of people in vulnerable countries. Especially in Africa, but also in some parts of Asia and Latin America, climate change will undermine already frail governments -- and make challenges from violent groups more likely -- by reducing revenues, overwhelming bureaucracies and revealing how incapable these governments are of helping their citizens.
 We've learned in recent years that such failure can have consequences around the world and that great powers can't always isolate themselves from these consequences. It's time to put climate change on the world's security agenda.

HEADLINE: For Writers, A Voice Beyond The Page

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Seven years ago, Moniru Ravanipur, a novelist and short-story writer, was put on trial in her native Iran. Her supposed crime: threatening national security while attending a political conference in Berlin, where she openly discussed her country's reform movement.
 Now she plans to do it again. Ms. Ravanipur, 54, is one of more than 150 writers gathering in New York today for PEN American Center's third annual World Voices Festival of International Literature, which runs through Sunday. 
On Saturday Ms. Ravanipur, who has written eight books but is virtually unknown in the United States, will be speaking on a panel with two other Iranian writers. In an interview last week, she said she planned to discuss how, for example, the government had recently banned repeated use of the verb ''to do'' because it can have a sexual connotation in Persian.
 ''Discussion from people of different backgrounds with different problems,'' said Ms. Ravanipur through an interpreter, ''actually leads to the development of solutions of these problems.''
 That optimistic spirit is the organizing principle of the festival, which brings together people from 45 countries to talk not only about problems directly affecting writers, but also about other issues, from global warming and the international refugee crisis to the war in Iraq and political torture. 
 It is that direct engagement with political topics that perhaps makes the festival -- at least in the United States -- stand out. 
 Founded three years ago in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and in the midst of the Iraq war, the festival was conceived as a way of addressing America's cultural isolation. This year the theme is ''Home & Away.'' Writers of fiction and nonfiction will be speaking and reading at 66 events in 29 locations throughout the city.
 Merely bringing so many international writers to the United States, where fewer than 3 percent of the books published are translations, can be seen as a political act. 
 But the festival's organizers are also giving the authors a forum to address many political issues overtly, an opportunity that some writers believe has been on the decline in the United States. 
 ''You don't that often see writers being sought out when there are matters of great moment to discuss,'' said Salman Rushdie, the novelist, former president of PEN American Center and chairman of the World Voices festival. ''And I think that's a loss.''
 Mr. Rushdie, who viscerally knows all too well how politics can invade the literary sphere, added that the festival was ''a way that we could rectify the absence of literary voices from that public conversation.''
 Mr. Rushdie will help open the festival tonight at Cooper Union in the East Village with a panel, ''Green Thoughts: Writers on the Environment,'' in which authors including Pico Iyer, a British-born writer of Indian extraction, and Moses Isegawa, a Ugandan novelist, will read from others' work on the natural world. 
 Given the current focus on global warming, the topic is inevitably political. But the idea is to be literary, not polemical, Mr. Rushdie said. ''Audiences in the end come to enjoy themselves, and not to be preached at,'' he said. ''If they can hear poetry or literature which talks not just of the dangers but also of the beauty of the world that is endangered, that is an enriching way to deal with the subject.''
 Nadine Gordimer, the South African novelist and Nobel Prize winner, who is participating in two events at the festival, said writing could be political almost by default. 
 ''Everyone is influenced by the framework in which they live, so that politics comes into everything,'' she said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg. ''It's not expressed by us in a didactic way, but comes through our creation of characters who are indeed made up of the kind of world and the kind of reactions that people have toward that world.''
 Ms. Gordimer, of course, is perhaps more direct than many authors in the way she introduces politics into her writing. And she is politically active in her own right. 
 At one time, that might have seemed more commonplace in American letters, as it still is in Europe. Two decades ago, Norman Mailer convened a group of some 150 writers in New York for a meeting of the PEN World Congress, the organization's decision-making body. Ms. Gordimer was among those who vehemently protested the invitation to George P. Shultz, then secretary of state, to speak at the opening ceremony, and politics was very much the focus of the gathering.
 For a new generation, the World Voices Festival is one way of reinserting writers into the political arena. ''While novelists don't necessarily have anything meaningful to say outside of fiction, for better or worse, we can't help but think of our favorite writers as wise,'' Jonathan Safran Foer, a novelist who helped plan this year's event, said via e-mail. ''I can't, anyway. And when forming my political opinions, when shaping my life, I want the contribution of as many wise voices as I can have. It's a shame if that chorus includes journalists, and politicians, and philosophers, and scientists, and economists, but not writers.'' Wordsmiths Talk 
 World Voices Festival of International Literature, sponsored by the PEN American Center, will run from today through April 29 at 29 locations. Here are some highlights: 'TOWN HALL READINGS: WRITING HOME' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, with Don DeLillo, Kiran Desai, Nadine Gordimer, Salman Rushdie and others. 'WHERE ON EARTH: THE REFUGEE EMERGENCY' Thursday at 3 p.m., Lang Recital Hall, Hunter College, 695 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, with Ishmael Beah and the novelists Abdulrazak Gurnah and Laila Lalami. 'THE PEN CABARET' Saturday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, with Patti Smith, Sam Shepard and others. 'THE ARTHUR MILLER FREEDOM TO WRITE LECTURE' Sunday at 6:30 p.m., Cooper Union, Great Hall, Seventh Street at Third Avenue, East Village, with the Israeli novelist and journalist David Grossman, in conversation with Ms. Gordimer. 
 Some events are free; admission for ticketed events ranges from $10 to $15. Tickets can be purchased at smarttix.com or (212) 868-4444, or the event location. Schedule: pen.org.

HEADLINE: Kleiner Perkins to Expand With Two Offices in China

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 23 

 BODY:
The technology investment firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers is opening offices in Shanghai and Beijing and plans to invest a $360 million fund in Chinese Internet, energy, media and communications start-ups. 
 The move, to be announced on Tuesday, underscores the growing interest among venture capitalists in China's blossoming economy and entrepreneurial culture. Kleiner Perkins, while far from the first venture firm to enter China, is a particularly high-profile example of the trend.
Ted Schlein, a partner at the firm, said it was the first time that Kleiner, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif., has had partners working out of an office abroad. He said the firm took the unusual step because ''this is where opportunity is going to be in the world.''
 The development comes not just as China's economy is booming, but also as venture capitalists are becoming more willing to invest in start-ups overseas.
 The venture capitalists hope in some cases that those offshore companies will be able to sell shares on foreign stock exchanges, yielding healthy profits and compensating for the challenges faced by small technology companies trying to go public in the United States.
 Mr. Schlein said that he believed there was an opportunity to bring companies public in Hong Kong and on other regional exchanges.
 Separately on Monday, the National Venture Capital Association and PriceWaterhouseCoopers said that in the first quarter of 2007, venture capitalists invested $7.1 billion into start-ups. That is the highest quarterly figure since the fourth quarter of 2001, when venture capitalists invested $8 billion, according to the association, which is an industry trade group.
 Some venture capitalists said the growth reflected rising optimism in the industry that they would be able to take their investments public or have them be acquired at a premium. They have struggled in the last five years to achieve these ''exits,'' as the aftermath of the dot-com bust left a weak appetite among public market investors for shares in technology firms.

HEADLINE: Volvo Taps Two Agencies For Worldwide Campaign

 BODY:
The Volvo division of the Ford Motor Company has named a team of two agencies to handle its worldwide creative account. The agencies, Arnold Worldwide and Nitro, will share an assignment with spending estimated at $150 million to $200 million. 
 Arnold, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas, will take the lead on the global assignment, developing strategy and creative ideas from its Boston office. Nitro, from its London office, will focus on campaigns for most of Europe.
A review for the Volvo account, which began in December, also included Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, another Havas unit that had been the principal Volvo global creative agency since 1991.
 Euro RSCG was eliminated from the review in late March, along with 180 in Amsterdam, majority owned by the Omnicom Group. The final round of the review pitted the team of Arnold and Nitro against Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe. 
 Arnold is returning to the automotive category after almost two years. The agency lost its Volkswagen of America creative account in 2005 to Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami, part of MDC Partners. Volvo is the first automotive client for Nitro, a fast-growing independent agency that works for marketers like Mars and Unilever.
 The campaigns that Arnold and Nitro will create will appear in big Volvo markets like North America and much of Europe. Other regions of the world can adapt the ads for their local needs.
 The first ads from Arnold and Nitro will help Volvo introduce two major models, the V70 station wagon and the XC70 crossover. 
 They are due in the summer and fall.
 Euro RSCG will continue creating ads for Volvo in the Asian-Pacific market, but that assignment is expected to be placed in review in several months. Nitro, which was founded in Shanghai in 2002, has experience in the Asian-Pacific region.

HEADLINE: Make Less Than $240 Million? You're Off Top Hedge Fund List

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
James Simons, a 69-year-old publicity shy former math professor, uses complex computer-driven mathematical models to make bets on stocks, bonds and commodities, among other things.
 His earnings last year were $1.7 billion.
As one of the leading hedge fund managers, Mr. Simons makes a sum that dwarfs that of the top chiefs on Wall Street. The highest paid on the Street, Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, earned $54.3 million in salary, cash, restricted stock and stock options last year. (Unlike the total for Mr. Simons, Mr. Blankfein's reported compensation does not include gains on investments.) 
 And Mr. Simons, the founder of Renaissance Technologies, is not the only member of the billion-dollars-a-year club.
 Two other hedge fund managers, Kenneth C. Griffin and Edward S. Lampert, each took home more than $1 billion last year, with George Soros missing the hurdle by a hair, give or take $50 million, according to an annual ranking of the top 25 hedge fund earners by Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine, which comes out today. 
 The rewards for managing hedge funds -- lightly regulated private investment pools for institutions like endowments and wealthy individuals -- have been lucrative for some time. Yet the survey also shows that for the hedge fund elite, the rich are getting much richer in a hurry. 
 To make Alpha's list, a manager needed to earn at least $240 million last year, nearly double the amount in 2005. That is up from a minimum of $30 million in 2001 and 2002. Combined, the top 25 hedge fund managers last year earned $14 billion -- enough to pay New York City's 80,000 public school teachers for nearly three years.
 With the modern gilded age in full swing, hedge fund managers and their private equity counterparts are comfortably seated atop one of the most astounding piles of wealth in American history. 
 Their ascendancy has been aided by an inflow of money from pension funds and other big investors, robust markets and fee-based compensation that can produce staggering amounts of individual wealth. 
 Naturally, some look upon these masters of the new universe as this generation's robber barons, using wealth to create wealth, often in secretive ways, and leaving little that is tangible in their wake. 
 Others view them as new-economy financiers, evoking the likes of John D. Rockefeller or John Pierpont Morgan as they provide liquidity to the markets and broadly diversify risks in the banking and financial systems.
 ''You had railroads in the 19th century, which led to the opening up of the steel industry and huge fortunes being made,'' said Stephen Brown, a professor at the Stern School of Business of New York University. ''Now we're seeing changes in financial technology leading to new fortunes being made and new dynasties created.'' 
 But as hedge funds and their private equity brethren begin to emerge more onto the public stage -- playing increasingly bigger roles in art and cultural circles, tiptoeing into the Washington lobbying game, and even selling shares of their own firms to the public -- all aspects of their activities, their own compensation in particular, are raising eyebrows.
 ''There is some question as to what the hell they are doing that is worth'' that kind of money, said J. Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The answer is damned mysterious.''
 Indeed, to some, it is difficult to see the value and the risks created by a hedge fund that bets billions of dollars on movements in everything from global currencies, stocks and bonds to real estate, reinsurance and complex credit derivatives. Recently, for instance, the House Financial Services Committee held hearings focusing on the potential risks to pensioners and the financial system caused by hedge funds.
 Yet many, including past and current Federal Reserve chieftains, argue that they are greasing the wheels of capitalism.
 While the debate rages, the new financiers are building up piles of money not seen since the heady days of the Internet boom. But unlike the wealth of many dot-com billionaires, who saw their fortunes collapse with the technology bubble, the gains of hedge funds are not simply returns on paper that fluctuate with the direction of the stock market. Instead the gains are huge cash payouts that most managers then reinvest in their funds, betting that they will continue to beat the markets.
 Still, the performance of these managers is as varied as their strategies, ranging from complex computer models to the more old-fashioned version of betting the farm on a few stocks. None of the managers contacted for this article returned calls or would comment.
 For its rankings on compensation, Alpha magazine includes the managers' share of the firm's management fees, usually 2 percent, and performance fees, or a share of the profits, which typically start at 20 percent.
 That structure means that some hedge fund managers can still earn a huge income even with mediocre returns because of the huge size of the assets under management. Raymond T. Dalio, head of Bridgewater Associates, which has more than $30 billion in hedge fund assets, for example, took home $350 million last year even though his flagship Pure Alpha Strategy fund posted a net return of just 3.4 percent for the second consecutive year. 
 The magazine also includes gains made on hedge fund managers' own capital in their funds. Mr. Simons, for instance, has more than $1 billion of his own money invested in his funds.
 Topping Alpha's list for the second consecutive year, Mr. Simons, a former code breaker for the Defense Department, uses computer-driven models to detect pricing anomalies in stocks, commodities, futures and options. 
 Even though he has some of the highest fees in the business -- 5 percent of assets under management and 44 percent of profits -- he trounces most of his competitors year after year. In 2006, the $6 billion Medallion fund posted gross returns of 84 percent; 44 percent after fees, explaining his $1.7 billion take. 
 Some investors do not blink at paying those startling fees. ''If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys,'' said Jim Dunn, a managing director with Wilshire Associates, an investment advisory firm. ''We don't concern ourselves with fees. If you can provide Alpha, I'm less concerned about what you bring home.'' (Alpha is producing returns that are not tied to a market benchmark like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.)
 While Mr. Simons makes his mark using algorithms, the two other billionaires on this year's list are building distinctive institutions. 
 Mr. Griffin's Citadel Investment Group of Chicago is often cited as a budding Goldman Sachs, and Mr. Griffin himself is playing an increasingly public role in Chicago, with causes ranging from art to education. 
 Citadel employs 1,000 people, more than half of them in technology, and runs businesses serving hedge funds and another making markets. Mr. Griffin's funds, with returns of more than 30 percent, helped net him a nifty $1.4 billion. 
 Compare that with the elusive Mr. Lampert, who has $11 billion of his $14.6 billion ESL fund in the retailer Sears Holdings. Last year, Sears stock rose and with it, Mr. Lampert's fortune by about $1.3 billion. 
 And if the Internet age was defined by youth, the hedge fund age illustrates that experience indeed pays. 
 The average age of Alpha's top 25 was 51, with only four thirty-somethings on the list. Among them is John Arnold, the 32-year-old from Centaurus Advisors who amassed net gains of 200 percent last year.
 Mr. Arnold hails from Enron's energy desk, where he received a lifetime of trading and other experiences. His $3 billion fund, among the largest energy funds in the world, racked up huge gains by taking the other side of a natural gas bet that caused Amaranth to lose more than $6 billion in a week. 
 But older, more familiar names dominate Alpha's list. Boone Pickens, the 78-year-old oil tycoon, made $340 million on the back of strong returns at his energy funds and Carl C. Icahn, 71, the reborn activist investor, made $600 million.
 With a greater proportion of the assets in the hedge fund industry controlled by fewer managers, some investors worry that managers are at a turning point. The same young and brash managers who achieved huge successes are now controlling vast sums of assets, and the incentive may be to protect their wealth rather than take risks to increase it.
 ''I think one of the significant issues of this business that we are all struggling with is that there is an inverse correlation between compensation and drive,'' said Mark W. Yusko, president of Morgan Creek Capital Management, an investment advisory firm. ''In many cases the incredible wealth that is created by this incentive compensation structure has a propensity to dull the senses and dull the drive.''

HEADLINE: Obama, in Foreign Policy Speech, Urges U.S. Leadership

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 23 

 BODY:
Presenting himself as a presidential candidate ''who can speak directly to the world,'' Senator Barack Obama on Monday outlined his approach to foreign policy, vowing to double foreign aid, expand and modernize the military, and rebuild fractured alliances.
 In a speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Mr. Obama combined a harsh critique of the Bush administration with a call for the United States to resist the temptation to turn inward. A robust engagement in world affairs, he said, will help reduce the threat of terrorism and repair what he characterized as the nation's bruised image across the globe. 
''America cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We must neither retreat from the world nor try to bully it into submission -- we must lead the world, by deed and example.''
 It was the first of several policy speeches that Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois, is to deliver in coming weeks as he works to define his candidacy with specific proposals to pursue if elected. He likened today's challenges to those facing the United States after World War II, saying that building a similar pattern of diplomatic and economic alliances could strengthen the nation's hand.
 As a first-term senator, Mr. Obama faces the challenge of convincing voters that he has the experience necessary to lead the nation in wartime. He renewed his call for most American combat brigades to be withdrawn from Iraq by March 31, 2008, but he spoke more broadly of what he described as a need for the United States to use its influence around the world in ways that extend beyond the use of force. 
 His foreign policy, he said, would more closely resemble the ''burden sharing'' the first President Bush employed during the Persian Gulf war than the current administration's approach.
 ''No president should ever hesitate to use force -- unilaterally if necessary -- to protect ourselves and our vital interests when we are attacked or imminently threatened,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But when we use force in situations other than self-defense, we should make every effort to garner the clear support and participation of others.''
 In the opening three months of the race, Mr. Obama has solidified his role as one of the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination, raising more money than any of his rivals for the primary campaign and drawing tens of thousands of admirers to rallies across the nation. But Mr. Obama is also striving to expand his appeal beyond that of a best-selling author and political celebrity as he tackles questions of substance and policy. 
 ''This election offers us the chance to turn the page and open a new chapter in American leadership,'' Mr. Obama said. ''This is going to require a new spirit, not of bluster and bombast, but of quiet confidence and sober intelligence, a spirit of care and renewed competence.''
 Lisa Miller, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, dismissed the criticism.
 ''Senator Obama started his career with a tone of hope but has quickly turned to one of blame,'' Ms. Miller said. ''Obama has no foreign policy experience, therefore has no record of having done anything -- wrong or otherwise.''
 In his 40-minute address, Mr. Obama did not dwell on his own biography, including his father's family from Africa, or that he spent part of his childhood living abroad. But his speech was punctuated with examples of his global travels and the underlying subtext that his world view was shaped differently from other candidates in the presidential race.
 If elected, he said, he would double foreign aid to $50 billion by 2012, which would be the final year of his first term.
 ''I know that many Americans are skeptical about the value of foreign aid today,'' Mr. Obama said. ''A relatively small investment in these fragile states up front can be one of the most effective ways to prevent the terror and strife that is far more costly both in lives and treasure to the United States down the road.''
 The United States also must build a 21st-century military, Mr. Obama said, in addition to ''showing wisdom in how we deploy it.'' He called for expanding ground forces, adding 65,000 soldiers to the Army and 27,000 to the Marines. Less than 1 percent of the military can speak foreign languages like Arabic, Mandarin or Korean, he said, calling for additional training and recruitment to address the problem.
 Mr. Obama said he would lead an effort to secure nuclear stockpiles and materials across the world within four years.
 To prevent countries from building weapons programs, Mr. Obama endorsed the concept of an international nuclear fuel bank, proposed last year by former Senator Sam Nunn, who now advises the Nuclear Threat Initiative. As president, Mr. Obama said he would provide $50 million to get the fuel bank started and urge Russia and other countries to join.
 ''The American moment has not passed,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The American moment is here. And like generations before us, we will seize that moment and begin the world anew.''

HEADLINE: Projections Show Troubles Still Loom for Benefit Plans

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23 

 BODY:
Two seemingly inexorable forces, rising medical costs and the looming retirement of the baby boom generation, are set to overwhelm the Medicare program by 2019, the Bush administration reported Monday.
 The Social Security trust fund, which finances the government's giant retirement program, is on track to run out of reserves by 2041 -- less dire than the outlook for Medicare but still not sustainable without raising taxes or cutting benefits.
The new estimates, prepared by the trustees of the federal government's main entitlement programs for the elderly and the disabled, are broadly similar to projections from last year, but have become significantly more ominous over the last six years. 
 ''Without change, rising costs will drive government spending to unprecedented levels, consume nearly all projected federal revenues and threaten America's future prosperity,'' said Henry M. Paulson Jr., secretary of the Treasury and a trustee of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
 But Congressional Democrats retorted that President Bush had squandered valuable time after his re-election in 2004 by pushing for an overhaul of Social Security that would have allowed people to channel payroll tax contributions to private investment accounts. That proposal got nowhere in Congress, and Mr. Bush effectively dropped his effort last year. 
 ''Instead of peddling an ill-conceived Social Security privatization plan that has already been overwhelmingly rejected by the American people, the administration should turn its attention to strengthening Medicare,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
 Mr. Paulson said he had little hope of reaching agreement with Democratic leaders in Congress.
 ''There was a time when I was a bit more optimistic than I am today,'' Mr. Paulson said Monday. ''I'm getting a little tired of playing solitaire.'' 
 Though Medicare spending has climbed more slowly than expected in some areas, particularly the new prescription drug benefit, the trustees reiterated their dire warnings about the financial outlook for both Medicare and Social Security.
 The trustees said that Medicare's problems were more immediate and more difficult to solve. Medicare costs are propelled upward by increases in prices for medical care and by an imminent explosion in the number of retirees as 76 million members of the baby boom generation become eligible for benefits.
 Spending on Medicare hit $408 billion last year, about 3.1 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, and was the biggest federal program after the Department of Defense.
 The new report projects that Medicare's share of the total economy will double to more than 6.5 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030.
 For the first time, the trustees issued a formal ''warning'' about Medicare's increasing reliance on general tax revenues, rather than payroll taxes and premiums specifically earmarked for the program.
 This finding requires President Bush to submit proposed solutions to Congress early next year.
 In February, Mr. Bush proposed to cut the growth of Medicare by $65.6 billion over the next five years. Under those proposals, more and more Medicare beneficiaries would have to pay higher premiums for coverage of prescription drugs and doctors' services, and Medicare would trim payments to most types of health care providers.
 Administration officials as well as the program's independent trustees said Medicare's actual outlook over the next decade was probably worse than the official projections.
 That is because the projections assume that Medicare will follow current law and sharply reduce payments to doctors. As a practical matter, Congress has blocked those reductions for the last four years and is likely to continue doing so to prevent physicians from refusing to take Medicare patients.
 John L. Palmer, one of two independent trustees of Medicare and Social Security, estimated that Medicare spending would be as much as $400 billion higher over the next 10 years if Congress blocks the reductions in payments to physicians.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said Democrats were ignoring the urgent fiscal problems that lie just ahead.
 The Democrats' budget blueprint, passed in different form by the House and the Senate, ''doesn't do anything to address entitlement spending'' and simply assumes $15 billion in savings by cutting payments to certain health care providers, Mr. Grassley said.
 There were a few bright spots in the report. 
 Spending from Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund was lower than expected last year because of ''an abrupt decrease in the number of hospital admissions.'' After increasing about 2 percent a year for some years, the number of admissions appeared to decline by 4 percent last year, to 13.1 million, the trustees said.
 Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and humans services, said it was possible that the new drug benefit for Medicare recipients could have improved their health and reduced the need for hospital care.
 But an analysis of the data by Medicare actuaries says the sharp decline in hospital admissions ''is believed to be a one-time random fluctuation.''
 The trustees said their new estimate of the cost of Medicare's prescription drug benefit over the next decade was ''significantly lower'' than the estimate they made a year ago. They described this as an ''extraordinary change,'' reflecting several factors. 
 Private insurers, which administer the drug benefit, are submitting lower bids to the government, in the expectation that they can increase the use of low-cost generic drugs and control the use of brand-name medicines, the trustees said.
 David Sloane, director of government relations at AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said Medicare's problems could not be solved without addressing those of the overall health care system.
 ''Medicare's insolvency is a symptom of the disease, which is escalating costs throughout our health care system,'' Mr. Sloane said.

HEADLINE: Wolfowitz Hires Prominent Lawyer in Fight to Stay at World Bank

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz, signaling anew that he will fight for his job as World Bank president, has enlisted a prominent lawyer who defended President Bill Clinton against accusations of sexual misconduct to help convince the bank's board that Mr. Wolfowitz has done nothing to justify being ousted.
 Robert S. Bennett, the lawyer selected by Mr. Wolfowitz, said in an interview that before the bank's board acted on charges of ethical lapses, he and Mr. Wolfowitz wanted more time to prepare a case showing that the bank president had acted properly on all matters that the board is investigating. 
''I am very worried about the rush to judgment,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''We just had a wonderful example of that in the Duke lacrosse case. I have reviewed the essential documents, and I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that Mr. Wolfowitz exercised good faith and that everything he did was in the best interests of the bank.''
 It was unclear whether Mr. Wolfowitz intended to pay his legal fees himself or whether he would seek reimbursement from the bank. His latest sign of apparent determination to keep his job came as the furor over his record continued to spread.
 Bank officials said that after several days of canvassing hundreds of employees, about 25 vice presidents of the bank were preparing to document that the overwhelming majority of the employees favor Mr. Wolfowitz's departure.
 The vice presidents met with Mr. Wolfowitz in the afternoon and some bank officials said that they would present their conclusions about bank sentiment to the board of directors, the 24 representatives of various countries and groups of countries that run the bank's day-to-day affairs in tandem with the president.
 The Financial Times reported on Monday that the independent agency within the bank that assesses the effectiveness of bank programs concluded last week that ''swift changes in management'' were needed to restore its credibility. 
 In addition, a group of more than 40 former top officials at the bank, many of whom departed after clashing with Mr. Wolfowitz, issued a public call for him to resign.
 Mr. Wolfowitz has tangled with the board and staff members on various issues, especially his anticorruption agenda, since he arrived in 2005 after serving as deputy secretary of defense and a chief architect of the Iraq war. But anger erupted this month over Mr. Wolfowitz's acknowledgment that he had played a much larger role than previously understood in the pay-and-promotion package given to Shaha Ali Riza, his companion, two years ago. Ms. Riza, who had worked at the bank for seven years, was detailed to the State Department at that time.
 In the last week or so, concern over two other issues -- family planning and the environment -- was spreading new rancor in the bank, contributing to the criticism. 
 Documents have surfaced indicating that one of Mr. Wolfowitz's two top deputies, Juan J. Daboub, a managing director and former finance official in El Salvador, had deleted language referring to ''family planning'' and ''climate change'' in separate bank documents. 
 Some bank officials charge that these changes were made at the behest of the Bush administration. But they say that Mr. Wolfowitz and Mr. Daboub have denied during internal meetings that they intended to carry out any kind of policy change.
 ''None of the editorial changes that were made at my direction changed, or intended to change, the bank group's program in the area of family planning,'' Mr. Daboub wrote in an e-mail message to the bank's vice presidents last week. 
 On Monday, the bank's chief scientist, Robert T. Watson, said in an interview that Mr. Daboub ''literally tried to eliminate the words 'climate change' everywhere in a policy paper'' but that the words were put back. He said he was ''absolutely convinced'' that Mr. Wolfowitz had no role in the efforts.
 Nevertheless, bank officials said that these issues were roiling the bank and that many officials wanted the board to make them part of its widening investigation of Mr. Wolfowitz into matters beyond Ms. Riza.
 Mr. Bennett, a longtime player in Washington's legal and political scene, said in the interview that he had not completed his own review of the Wolfowitz documents but was convinced that, on the matter of Ms. Riza, he had acted in good faith and that whatever his shortcomings -- such as becoming involved directly in the matter of her salary -- were being seized upon by people with other agendas.
 ''I don't see any hanging offenses here, certainly no violations of law,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''People with their own private or personal agendas are using this incident to accomplish broader goals inconsistent with the mission of the bank.''
 Mr. Bennett would not give details, but Mr. Wolfowitz's supporters maintain that European directors of the bank are using the episode to wrest control of the bank away from Mr. Wolfowitz and the Bush administration.
 Mr. Bennett was the lawyer last year for Judith Miller, the former reporter for The New York Times who was jailed for refusing to testify to a grand jury in the investigation of the leak of the identity of Valerie Plame as a Central Intelligence Agency operative.
 He represented Mr. Clinton in the case brought by Paula Jones and helped settle the lawsuit.

PERSON: Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin 

HEADLINE: Boris N. Yeltsin, Reformer Who Broke Up the U.S.S.R. And Led Russia, Dies at 76

BYLINE: By MARILYN BERGER; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
Boris N. Yeltsin, the burly provincial politician who became a Soviet-era reformer and later a towering figure of his time as the first freely elected leader of Russia, presiding over the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the demise of the Communist Party, died yesterday in Moscow. He was 76.
 His death, at a hospital, came at 3:45 p.m., the Kremlin said, making the announcement without ceremony, a reflection of the contradictory legacy of Mr. Yeltsin's presidency in the view of many Russians, including his successor, the current leader, President Vladimir V. Putin.
Medical officials told Russian news agencies that Mr. Yeltsin had died of heart failure after being admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow. He had suffered heart problems for years, undergoing surgery shortly after his disputed re-election as Russian president in 1996. 
 In office less than nine years, beginning with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and plagued by severe health problems and an excessive fondness for alcohol, Mr. Yeltsin added a final chapter to his historical record when, in 1999, he stunned Russians and the world by announcing his resignation, becoming the first Russian leader to give up power on his own in accordance with constitutional processes. He then turned over the reins of office to Mr. Putin on New Year's Eve 1999, and after that was out of the public eye. 
 Mr. Yeltsin was at once the country's democratic father and a reviled figure blamed for most of the ills and hardships after the Soviet collapse. The last Soviet president and, for a time, his rival for power, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, speaking yesterday, called Mr. Yeltsin's ''a tragic fate.''
 ''I express the very deepest condolences to the family of the deceased on whose shoulders rest major events for the good of the country, and serious mistakes,'' Mr. Gorbachev told the Interfax news agency. 
 Mr. Putin released a statement late Monday declaring that Mr. Yeltsin had given the country democracy as the first elected president of Russia. ''Under this title, he has taken his place in the history of this country, and of the world,'' Mr. Putin said. He made no mention of Mr. Yeltsin's role in his own rise to power. He declared April 25 a day of national mourning.
 Mr. Yeltsin left a giant, if flawed, legacy. He started to establish a democratic state and then pulled back, lurching from one prime minister to another. But where Mr. Gorbachev sought to perpetuate the Communist Party, Mr. Yeltsin helped break the party's hold over the Russian people. Although his commitment to reform wavered, Mr. Yeltsin eliminated censorship of the news media, tolerated public criticism and steered Russia toward a free market. The rapid privatization of industry led to a form of buccaneer capitalism and a new class of oligarchs, who usurped political power as they plundered the country's resources.
 But Mr. Yeltsin's actions ensured that there would be no turning back to the centralized Soviet command economy, which had strangled growth and reduced a country of talented and cultured people and rich in natural resources to a beggar among nations.
 Not least, Mr. Yeltsin was instrumental in dismembering the Soviet Union and allowing its former republics to make their way as independent states. 
 His leadership was erratic and often crude, and as a democrat he often ruled in the manner of a czar. He showed no reluctance to use the power of the presidency to face down his opponents, as he did in 1993, when he ordered tanks to fire on a Parliament dominated by openly seditious Communists, and as he did again in 1994, when he embarked on a harsh military operation to subdue the breakaway republic of Chechnya. It began a costly and ruinous war that almost became his undoing and that was ferociously revived in 1999 and still being waged when he resigned that year. 
 His relationship with the United States was a complicated one. President Clinton seized on the fall of the Soviet Union as an opportunity to advance American interests, and he and Mr. Yeltsin maintained a strikingly good rapport. In his dealings with Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton was protective, careful not to tempt old-line Communists to try to turn the clock back to dictatorship. There was some success between the two countries on nuclear issues, the removal of Soviet troops from the Baltic states and Moscow's cooperation with NATO as it expanded toward the borders of Russia itself.
 Yesterday, expressions of condolence poured into Moscow. Tributes to his democratic leadership were tempered by criticism of the corruption and lawlessness of the 1990s, the two devastating wars in Chechnya that began on his watch and, perhaps most of all, the feeling that Russia had lost its stature on the world stage.
 Still, Mr. Yeltsin received grudging praise even from old enemies, like the nationalist leader and presidential challenger in 2006, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who said the country was never freer than it was under Mr. Yeltsin. Boris E. Nemtsov, a liberal politician who was a deputy prime minister under Mr. Yeltsin, described him as ''a very rare leader'' in Russian history who believed in open political competition.
 Although Mr. Nemtsov criticized parts of Mr. Yeltsin's legacy, like the wars in Chechnya, he noted that Mr. Yeltsin had listened to dissent. ''What is a pity is that his successor killed his initiatives and his successes,'' Mr. Nemtsov said. Heroism and Weakness 
 The Yeltsin era effectively began in August 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin, as president of the Soviet republic of Russia, clambered atop a tank to rally Muscovites to put down a right-wing coup against Mr. Gorbachev, a heroic moment etched in the minds of the Russian people and television viewers around the world; it ended with his electrifying resignation speech on New Year's Eve 1999. 
 Those were Mr. Yeltsin's finest hours in an era marked by extraordinary political and economic change. To turn around the battleship that was the Soviet Union -- with its bloated military-industrial establishment, its ravaged economy, its despoiled environment and its antiquated health and social services system -- would have been a herculean task for any leader in the prime of life and the best of health.
 But Mr. Yeltsin, a dedicated but imperfect reformer, was a man in precarious health whose frequent disappearances from public life were attributed to heart and respiratory problems, heavy drinking and bouts of depression. These personal weaknesses left a sense of lost opportunity.
 Still, a former United States ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack F. Matlock Jr., said that Mr. Yeltsin, along with Mr. Gorbachev, deserved credit for what he called a ''tremendous achievement.'' 
 Together, he said in an interview, ''they destroyed the most monstrous political system in the history of the world, a regime with extensive resources to keep itself in power.'' 
 Mr. Yeltsin was the most populist of politicians. He rejected the notion of forming a political party, insisting that he was elected by ''all'' of the people. But it was a position that left him weak at the task of building coalitions to further necessary reforms. He sometimes played with the truth and surrounded himself with cronies.
 Then, in failing health and under suspicion of enriching himself and his inner circle at the expense of the state, he resigned. In a speech that surprised the world, he asked forgiveness for his mistakes and turned over the government to Mr. Putin, a loyal aide and former officer of the K.G.B. In return, Mr. Yeltsin -- and, it was rumored, his family -- received a grant of immunity from criminal prosecution and credit for leaving the Kremlin voluntarily. 
 Mr. Yeltsin left with his fondest wish for the Russian people only partly fulfilled. ''I want their lives to improve before my own eyes,'' he once said, remembering growing up in a single room in a cold, communal hut. 
 In fact, in the chaos that accompanied the transition from the centralized economy he had inherited from the old Soviet Union, most people saw their circumstances deteriorate. Inflation became rampant, the poor became poorer, profiteers grew rich, the military and many state employees went unpaid, and criminality flourished. 
 Mr. Gorbachev had sought to preserve the Soviet Union and, with his programs of glasnost and perestroika, to give Communism a more human dimension. Mr. Yeltsin, on the other hand, believed that democracy, the rule of law and the market were the answers to Russia's problems.
 A big man with a ruddy face and white hair, he was full of peasant bluster -- what the Russians call a real muzhik -- and came to Moscow with a genuine warmth and concern for his countrymen. On a visit to the United States in 1989, he became convinced that Russia had been ruinously damaged by its state-run economic system, in which people stood in long lines to buy the most basic needs of life and more often than not found the shelves bare. Visiting a Houston supermarket, he was overwhelmed by the kaleidoscopic variety of meats and vegetables available to ordinary Americans. 
 A Russia scholar, Leon Aron, quoting a Yeltsin associate, wrote that Mr. Yeltsin was in a state of shock. ''For a long time, on the plane to Miami, he sat motionless, his head in his hands,'' Mr. Aron wrote in his 2000 biography, ''Yeltsin, A Revolutionary Life.'' '' 'What have they done to our poor people?' he said after a long silence.''
 Mr. Yeltsin became a hero to the Russian people and a world figure that day in August 1991 when he climbed atop a Soviet Army tank and faced down right-wing forces who were threatening to overthrow Mr. Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader. 
 Long a thorn in Mr. Gorbachev's side and soon to become his most powerful rival, on that day Mr. Yeltsin was Mr. Gorbachev's ally. ''Citizens of Russia,'' Mr. Yeltsin declared. ''We are dealing with a right-wing, reactionary, anticonstitutional coup d'etat. We appeal to citizens of Russia to give an appropriate rebuff to the putschists.''
 Thousands of Muscovites came out in the streets to support him, and the coup was defeated. But not long afterward he became the instrument of Mr. Gorbachev's downfall and with it the dissolution of the Soviet state. 
 Mr. Yeltsin's accomplishments are all the more remarkable given the odds against him. Bill Keller, who covered the Soviet Union for The New York Times from 1986 to 1991 and is now the paper's executive editor, observed that when ''Yeltsin emerged in the mid-1980s as the Communist Party boss of Moscow, a rambunctious, crowd-pleasing reformer, Western officials viewed him as an uninvited guest at the Gorbachev honeymoon.'' 
 ''What a flake!'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III was said to have remarked after meeting Mr. Yeltsin. ''He sure makes Gorbachev look good by comparison.''
 To scholars on the left, he was an irksome distraction from the attempt to humanize Communism; to scholars on the right, his origins as a Communist functionary in the hinterlands made him suspect. ''A typical provincial apparatchik'' was the judgment of Dmitri K. Simes, a leading Russian scholar. 
 Yet Mr. Yeltsin had apparently been underestimated. He survived expulsion from the Communist Party Politburo in 1987, the Communist coup attempt in 1993, a failed effort to subdue Chechnya in 1994, a new challenge from the Communists in 1996, economic collapse in 1998 and a Communist-led drive to impeach him in 1999.
 He also survived frequent bouts of influenza, bronchitis and pneumonia, quintuple bypass surgery in 1996, continuing heart problems, a bleeding ulcer, uncounted missed appointments and even the spectacle of toppling over at official ceremonies, due, it was widely believed, to overindulgence in vodka and bourbon.
 Mr. Yeltsin may well be remembered less as a builder of institutions than as a destroyer of them. He dismantled the Soviet Union and the Communist Party, put an end to the centralized Soviet economy and crushed the putsch that threatened to return the country to the old ways. 
 But he could only begin the transition to a democratic, capitalist Russia based on the rule of law. The system he put in place, after fending off both legislative and military challenges, remains fragile, often incoherent and based on personality. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Yeltsin brought about fundamental economic change: a market economy, however distorted and corrupt; an emerging younger class of business executives; and, in the last years of his presidency, a gradual reduction in crime. 
 Politically, too, his reforms had impact. The legislature began to shape politics, the news media kept most of their newly acquired freedoms, and political rivals competed openly in elections. 
 In his lifetime, the worst that many in Russia and the West had feared -- a Communist revival or new fascism built on chaos -- never materialized, although press freedoms have been curtailed under Mr. Putin and fears about the fragility of democracy in Russia have been stirred. 
 But Mr. Yeltsin failed when it came to the undramatic work of hammering out the political and economic framework needed to consolidate the new Russian state. His refusal to establish a new political party left him without a structure for his reforms. 
 ''Yeltsin's understanding is a tabula rasa,'' said Vitaly T. Tretyakov, editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, one of Moscow's most respected newspapers. ''In economics, his knowledge is nil -- nil. In how to construct a state, zero. It's really the same in all fields. It's not his fault, of course. To come to power, he had to contest everything. But leading is a different matter.'' Stymied by War and Resistance 
 Mr. Yeltsin was an adept politician, regarded as better than Mr. Gorbachev. But perhaps because of an embarrassingly boisterous style, he never received the respect and affection in the West accorded Mr. Gorbachev, who was loved for his Western manner and his willingness to end the cold war's nuclear standoff. 
 Mr. Yeltsin was more of a democrat than his predecessor, but drawing on old habits from his years as a Communist Party boss, he surrounded himself with acolytes. They rarely told him what he did not want to hear, and led him into adventures like Chechnya. 
 Mr. Yeltsin's evolution as a politician was ultimately stymied by the fierce opposition to the changes he brought and by the unpopular war he began in Chechnya, which he was unable to win and was unwilling to end.
 His campaign to subdue the secessionists in Chechnya, starting in December 1994, left as many as 80,000 people dead. It undermined his moral authority and threatened his hold on power. It exposed the breakdown of the once-vaunted Russian military machine. And it raised concern about the stability of a country still holding a huge nuclear arsenal. 
 The killing of civilians and widespread human rights abuses in Chechnya tainted the image of a democratic Russia in the West.
 Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin first came to public attention in 1985, when Mr. Gorbachev brought him to Moscow from Sverdlovsk (now once again called Yekaterinburg), where he was party chief. He breezed into the capital, a bumptious provincial, and was soon jumping on trolley buses and demanding to know why they were not running on time and charging into stores to harangue managers over empty shelves.
 When he was appointed by Mr. Gorbachev as head of the Moscow City Party Committee, Mr. Yeltsin declared war on bribery and corruption, fought against the privileges the party elite considered its right, and worked to get food -- particularly fresh vegetables -- into stores and private markets. 
 He sought to make the city more attractive and livable, with street cafes and fruit stalls. He encouraged a freer press.
 It was when he brought his brusque manner and open criticism to the inner workings of the Communist Party that he fell afoul of his mentor, Mr. Gorbachev, creating a rupture that was never healed. 
 Mr. Yeltsin took the unusual step at a closed party plenum in 1987 of launching a personal attack on his conservative rival, Yegor K. Ligachev, and denouncing the lethargic pace of reform. His speech was not published, but his words percolated into the Moscow rumor mill.
 Mr. Yeltsin's break with the party had begun, and it was that moment that Mr. Gorbachev chose to humiliate him. He called Mr. Yeltsin away from his sickbed to face criticism from the Moscow Party, which then dismissed Mr. Yeltsin as Moscow Party leader and forced him to resign from the Politburo. Mr. Gorbachev gave him to a job in the construction bureaucracy. 
 Though Mr. Yeltsin was never rehabilitated by the party, Mr. Gorbachev and the party unwittingly provided the vehicle for his resurrection, by establishing an elected Parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies. Mr. Yeltsin saw his chance and ran for office as an underdog and victim. Campaigning on television, he denounced the privileges of the party elite and in 1989 won a Moscow citywide seat in the Congress with a remarkable 90 percent of the vote.
 Once in the Parliament, Mr. Yeltsin won the admiration of pro-democracy intellectuals, built alliances with nationalist leaders and established himself as the vital voice of Russia's future, while casting Mr. Gorbachev as the ghost of the Soviet past.
 Then in the spring of 1990, in another landslide, Mr. Yeltsin was elected to the Russian legislature, which voted him president of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. But Mr. Yeltsin wanted a popular mandate and called for elections. He stunned his fellow delegates when he resigned from the Communist Party and still won the popular vote for the presidency on June 12, 1991.
 That vote made him the first legitimately elected leader in the thousand years of Russian government, and provided him with an extraordinary forum for attacking Mr. Gorbachev's policies.
 It was two months later, in August 1991, that Mr. Yeltsin strode from his office in the Russian republic's headquarters, the White House, to thwart a right-wing coup, an act of heroism that saved Mr. Gorbachev but also sealed the Soviet leader's doom. From atop a T-72 tank, Mr. Yeltsin declared: ''The legally elected president of the country has been removed from power. We proclaim all decisions and decrees of this committee to be illegal.''
 His ability to rally Muscovites that night suggested that a democratic spirit was taking hold in a land that had known nothing but czars and commissars. Five days later, Mr. Gorbachev effectively closed the Bolshevik era when he resigned as general secretary of the Communist Party and dissolved its Central Committee. 
 Mr. Yeltsin saw himself as a man with a mission. ''The system gave birth to me, and the system changed me,'' he once said. ''Now it is time for me to change the system.'' Toward that end, days after he thwarted the coup, Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree suspending the activities of the Communist Party. And he created a Constitutional Court as a guarantee against the arbitrariness of the Soviet system, though the court later proved a pliable reed and revived the party.
 But even as Mr. Yeltsin had taken for Russia the mantle of Soviet power, he entered uncharted territory, and his country was already in a shambles. He had to build a state in a country where the people with experience had been loyal to the system he had just destroyed. ''I can't say that we had to start from scratch,'' he wrote, ''but almost.'' 
 Russia had moved from too strong a state to too weak a state. It had moved from autarky to dependence on goods from abroad. Under enormous pressures of economic disintegration and political disarray, Mr. Yeltsin set about to negotiate the dismantling of the Soviet Union and its republics. 
 Mr. Yeltsin first let the Baltic nations of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia go their own way, ending Mr. Gorbachev's increasingly violent efforts to keep them tied to the Soviet empire.
 By the end of that year, with the leaders of Belarus and Ukraine, he broke the Soviet Union apart and negotiated what became the Commonwealth of Independent States. But the grouping, dominated by Russia and plagued by ineffectiveness and lingering suspicions, was eventually all but abandoned as a useful instrument.
 Faced with an embittered Russian nationalism at home, Mr. Yeltsin reasserted Russian economic rights and tried to defend the rights of Russian nationals left stranded and unhappy in the new countries. 
 And under his command, Russia organized an independent (if demoralized) army and took control of most of the Soviet nuclear inheritance as well as the Soviet Union's seat on the United Nations Security Council.
 He also took on the Soviet debt. Mr. Yeltsin continued to pursue Mr. Gorbachev's policy of cooperation with the West, not least because economic aid could come only from that direction. He reaffirmed Russia's adherence to arms control treaties and to extensive arms reductions. 
 In his second term, despite resilient opposition from nationalists, he acquiesced in an expansion of NATO toward Russia's western border. 
 But his critics complained that he had ceded too much autonomy to the West and that he had been outmaneuvered by Ukraine, which gained control of much of the Black Sea fleet and its share of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal. Cronies, Cars and Country Houses 
 In time, the Boris Yeltsin who was admired for showing he could grow with each new responsibility seemed to become less flexible as president, more impulsive, less democratic, ever more reliant on cronies. It was said, for example, that he frequently took the advice of his longtime bodyguard, Aleksandr A. Korzhakov, a former K.G.B. officer and mysterious eminence grise, who had access to top-secret information and monitored everything that went in and out of Mr. Yeltsin's office. 
 In 1995 Natalya Ivanova, editor of Znamya, a highly regarded journal of literature and comment, said in an interview, ''Some people learn all their lives, and some people stop learning. Sadly, Yeltsin stopped learning in 1991.'' 
 At that time, when Mr. Yeltsin at first moved into the Kremlin office of the party general secretary, he said he felt uncomfortable in the lush surroundings. He explained in the second volume of his 1994 autobiography, ''The Struggle for Russia,'' that the move to the Kremlin was required for security purposes. But the luxurious trappings of office contradicted the populist platform on which he had been elected.
 What was more, the abandon with which his subordinates parceled out the old perks of office -- the cars, the country houses, the resort vacations -- suggested that for all the talk of change, things were looking very much the same. The bureaucratic elite that ran the Soviet Union had gotten over its shock and had begun to re-establish new ties to Mr. Yeltsin and the government. With that, the intellectuals became alienated. Ordinary Russians chafed under the steep price increases he ordered in the initial phase of his bold economic gamble, and many questioned the competence of the people he chose to carry out his reforms.
 In December 1991, Mr. Yeltsin backed a young economist, Yegor T. Gaidar, and eliminated price controls in early January 1992. This was shock therapy, Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged in his autobiography. ''They expected paradise on earth,'' he wrote, ''but instead they got inflation, unemployment, economic shock and political crisis.''
 To say nothing of crime and corruption. But shock therapy was applied for only a few months. When Mr. Yeltsin decided that Russia could take no more strain, and in the face of severe criticism from the holdover Parliament, he replaced Mr. Gaidar as prime minister in December 1992 with Mr. Chernomyrdin, a more reassuring industrialist who ran the natural-gas monopoly.
 Nevertheless, the fight with Parliament continued, with the opposition soon led by the man Mr. Yeltsin himself had chosen as vice president, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi. Mr. Yeltsin again put himself and his policies before the people, in a referendum in April 1993, and again he won a big vote of confidence. But by the autumn, he was forced to defend himself and his reforms in a bloody confrontation with more conservative nationalist legislators.
 The struggle became a serious fight for power and ended with the indelible image of tanks firing at the Parliament building itself. A Bloody Standoff in Moscow 
 In September 1993, Mr. Yeltsin dissolved the Russian legislature, declaring that the ''irreconcilable opposition'' of its large number of Communist holdovers had paralyzed his reforms. He acted after a member of the opposition, in a gesture Russians understood, indicated with a flick of the index finger that Mr. Yeltsin was drunk. But there was also strong evidence that the Parliament's leaders intended to remove him under the old Soviet constitution and empower Mr. Rutskoi, whom Mr. Yeltsin had summarily dismissed.
 Mr. Yeltsin announced elections to a new Parliament. The Supreme Soviet, the Parliament's day-to-day policy-making arm, responded by voting overwhelmingly to depose him. Mr. Yeltsin then ordered the police to surround the Parliament and cut off the electricity, setting the stage for the violent confrontation. 
 It came two weeks later, in October, after parliamentary supporters, urged on by Mr. Rutskoi, broke through police lines and rampaged through Moscow. With Mr. Yeltsin at his dacha and the government inattentive, the demonstrators could probably have taken the Kremlin if they had tried. 
 Mr. Yeltsin was in a panic. He called in elite troops. In a 10-hour barrage by tanks and armored personnel carriers, Mr. Yeltsin routed his rebellious opposition, leaving dozens dead and the vast White House a burning, windowless shell. It was the worst civil strife in Moscow since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.
 This time a different Yeltsin emerged. He imposed an overnight curfew and banned extremist opposition parties. He briefly closed down Pravda and other newspapers that had supported the rebels. Mr. Rutskoi and other leaders were jailed, only to be soon pardoned by the new Parliament. The Yeltsin optimism was gone.
 ''Do not say that someone has won and someone has lost,'' the shaken leader warned his people. ''These are inappropriate, blasphemous words. We have all been scorched by the deadly breath of fratricide.''
 By 1996, the threat of a Communist resurgence behind his chief rival for the presidency, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, energized Mr. Yeltsin. He threw himself into the campaign, flying all over the country, shaking thousands of hands and performing everything from peasant dances to a much-televised version of the twist.
 To ensure his victory, Mr. Yeltsin sealed a dramatic election pact with Aleksandr I. Lebed, a gruff former general he had fired. Mr. Yeltsin identified Mr. Lebed as a likely successor and made him chairman of the powerful National Security Council. But to ensure that Mr. Lebed would not become a rival, he then saddled him with trying to find an honorable end to the Chechnya fiasco.
 Just before the final round of voting, Mr. Yeltsin had what his doctors later acknowledged to be a heart attack, and he nearly disappeared from sight. It seemed the end of the Yeltsin era. But the latest setback to his health was hidden from voters by compliant Russian news media.
 Mr. Yeltsin later admitted that he had reached the point where he was prepared to scuttle democracy completely and outlaw the Communist Party. In his ''Midnight Diaries,'' published in 2000, the year after he stepped down from the presidency, Mr. Yeltsin wrote that he had gone so far as to have the decrees prepared. But a daughter, Tatiana Dyachenko, and the former Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais convinced him that a power grab would backfire. 
 Though frail, he beat back the Communist challenge of Mr. Zyuganov and won the election by a substantial majority. Afterward, an aide described him as ''colossally weary.''
 Mr. Yeltsin's poor health rendered him unable to start off his second term with the energetic recommitment to reform sought by Russia's Western supporters, especially President Clinton. Mr. Yeltsin then underwent quintuple bypass surgery. As his health worsened, politicians maneuvered to succeed him.
 He responded with his own maneuvers, appointing and firing four prime ministers in two years as he sought to deal with severe financial crisis. It was not until 1997 that Mr. Yeltsin got rid of the shadowy figure of Mr. Korzhakov. In August 1998, the ruble collapsed taking the Russian stock market with it. The government announced a moratorium on the repayment of some foreign debt and a restructuring of ruble-denominated debt. 
 Meanwhile the crisis worsened as the government started printing money, contributing further to inflation.
 A brutal campaign was resumed in Chechnya after Chechen bandits invaded the province of Dagestan in 1999, followed by a series of bombings of Moscow apartment houses that were attributed, rightly or wrongly, to Chechen terrorists. Although the war in the Caucasus was unpopular in 1994, it was now seen as an issue of Russian territorial integrity and self-defense. 
 When Mr. Clinton criticized Russia's bombardment of civilian areas in Chechnya, Mr. Yeltsin, in his last month in office, intemperately brandished his nuclear arsenal. It seemed, he said, that Mr. Clinton ''had for a minute forgotten that Russia has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons.''
 Mr. Yeltsin's health continued to decline. On a visit to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in Central Asia, he appeared to nearly fall over as he listened to a band. At a dinner, he gave a confused version of a speech, reading from the beginning, then the end; apparently realizing he had finished too quickly, he finally reverted to the middle section. 
 In 1999, the Communists in Russia's Parliament led a drive to impeach Mr. Yeltsin. In addition to waging what was called an illegal war in Chechnya, the charges against him included illegally dismantling the Soviet Union in 1991, staging the violent coup against rebellious Communists in Parliament in 1993, destroying the Russian military and committing genocide by allowing living standards to plummet, leading millions of Russians to an early death. The impeachment effort failed when 100 members of the legislature boycotted the vote.
 During his last month in office, Mr. Yeltsin, with the help of the popularity of his chosen successor, Mr. Putin, was able to win enough votes in the Parliament to pursue economic reform and break the Communist hold on legislation. But Mr. Putin was soon making alliances with the same Communists who had gone down to defeat. 
 Mr. Yeltsin was a moody man subject to pessimism and lassitude. In his autobiography, he wrote of the burdens he carried: ''The debilitating bouts of depression, the grave second thoughts, the insomnia and headaches in the middle of the night, the tears and despair, the sadness at the appearance of Moscow and other Russian cities, the flood of criticism from the newspapers and television every day, the harassment campaign at the Congress sessions.'' Raised in a Peasant Hut 
 If Mr. Yeltsin was unable to fulfill his vast promise, it was due more to the immensity of the task than to any lack of desire for change, for he knew first-hand the misery of the Russian people under Communism. 
 Boris Yeltsin was born on Feb. 1, 1931, to a peasant family in Butko, a village in the Sverdlovsk district of the Urals, the oldest of six children. When his father moved to the town of Berezniki as a laborer, during what Mr. Yeltsin called ''Stalin's so-called period of industrialization,'' the family was allocated a single room in a communal hut. He recalled in 1990 in the first volume of his autobiography, ''Against the Grain,'' that they lived in that hut for 10 years. 
 ''Winter was worst of all,'' he wrote. ''There was nowhere to hide from the cold. Since we had no warm clothes, we would huddle up to the nanny goat to keep warm. We children survived on her milk.''
 He was still a boy during World War II when he lost the thumb and forefinger of his left hand; he and some friends had stolen a grenade and were trying to take it apart to see what was inside when it exploded.
 At the Urals Polytechnic Institute he studied civil engineering and played volleyball. On graduation, he returned to Sverdlovsk, where he was offered the job of foreman at an industrial building site. He refused, insisting that he work in each trade so that when he was in a position to give orders, he would know what he was talking about. 
 He did not join the Communist Party until 1961, when he was 30, an age at which Mr. Gorbachev was already well on his way up in the party hierarchy. For Mr. Yeltsin, membership was a move to further his career in the Sverdlovsk construction agency, not an expression of belief in Communism. 
 Fifteen years later, after serving as a secretary of the Sverdlovsk provincial committee, Mr. Yeltsin became party chief for the region and stood out in the stagnation of the Brezhnev era as an activist less interested in the perquisites of office than in rooting out bureaucratic corruption.
 When Mr. Gorbachev became general secretary of the party in 1985, he sought out regional leaders, among them Mr. Yeltsin. But he may have gotten more than he bargained for. Seeking a Mr. Clean image, Mr. Yeltsin turned down an offer of a government dacha. ''We were shattered by the senselessness of it all,'' he wrote, after he and his family were taken to see a ''cottage'' of enormous fireplaces, marble paneling, chandeliers and grand furniture.
 Mr. Yeltsin had found a subject he could ride and he later used it, often, as a blunt club, at one point tartly enumerating all of Mr. Gorbachev's houses and dachas as he decried ''the leadership's privileges.''
 ''I believe the fault lies in his basic cast of character,'' he said of Mr. Gorbachev. ''He likes to live well, in comfort and luxury. In this he is helped by his wife.''
 To this he contrasted the simple tastes of his own wife and his daughters, Yelena Okulova and Tatiana Dyachenko, who, along with three grandchildren, survive him. But as Russia's new rich started dotting the countryside, Mr. Yeltsin, too, was soon enveloping himself in comfort and relative luxury, enjoying life at a state dacha, playing tennis, wearing trendy Western fashion, using more limousines than Mr. Gorbachev ever had, and allowing those officials around him to live equally well, if not better.
 At a time when state employees, army officials and pensioners went unpaid, a reported $823 million was spent to restore palaces, churches, offices and Mr. Yeltsin's Kremlin residence to czarist splendor. By 1999, Mr. Yeltsin and his family were being accused of accepting kickbacks. Living as a 'Great, Bright Flame' 
 It was Mr. Yeltsin's personal excesses that made him particularly vulnerable. In his 1989 visit to the United States, he acted like an American politician in the middle of a campaign. But reporters also noted his thirst for bourbon. In his autobiography, Mr. Yeltsin attributed his slurred speech during that visit to the effects of a sleeping pill and exhaustion from jet lag.
 In a still-puzzling incident before he became president, he turned up soaking wet at a police station near Moscow. According to one version, a jealous husband pushed him off a bridge. Mr. Yeltsin intimated that the K.G.B. was trying to kill him.
 Mr. Yeltsin denied reports that he drank too much, although he acknowledged that he turned to alcohol to relieve stress. ''I am not an ascetic,'' he told Barbara Walters in a televised interview in 1992. 
 ''Athletic activity and alcohol are two things that are incompatible with each other,'' he continued, speaking through an interpreter. ''I'm very actively engaged in sports, an hour and a half every Tuesday and Saturday, athletic exercise morning and night, a cold shower, and very intensive work for 19 to 20 hours a day.'' 
 Some attributed his aberrant antics and his puffy face to the pain medication he took for a severe back problem stemming from a 1990 airplane accident, and the way such medication might mix with alcohol.
 There was no such explanation for his erratic behavior some years later when an embarrassed Chancellor Helmut Kohl had to help him down the steps after he played the buffoon, boisterously picking up a baton to conduct the Berlin police orchestra. 
 Mr. Yeltsin was stung by criticism of his drinking and tried to clean up his image for awhile. But he was soon stumbling and slurring his words again and repeatedly disappearing again for long holidays.
 There were also signs of worsening heart disease, including a hospitalization in July 1995. For the first time, the Kremlin admitted there was a diagnosis, myocardial ischemia, which is a shortage of oxygen to the heart muscle because of narrowed arteries. He was out of the Kremlin for four weeks and then took a monthlong vacation.
 He had another attack of ischemia in October 1995, after a visit to France and the United States, and was hospitalized again. ''A man must live like a great, bright flame and burn as brightly as he can,'' Mr. Yeltsin said in March 1990. ''In the end he burns out. But this is better than a mean little flame.''
 After anointing Mr. Putin as his successor and being granted immunity from prosecution, Mr. Yeltsin largely withdrew from public life, devoting himself to his favorite pastime: tennis.
 He did occasionally weigh in. In 2004, he rebuked Mr. Putin's plans to eliminate direct elections for regional governors and individual members of Parliament in the wake of the terrorist attack on the school in Beslan, in southern Russia, where more than 300 hostages died. 
 More often, he praised Mr. Putin's stewardship and kept his concerns, if any, to himself. ''I am glad that I was not mistaken in choosing Vladimir Putin,'' he said in a magazine interview in 2006. ''I understand that a rapidly developing Russia needed a young president. I tried to find someone for whom the ideals of liberty and the free market, and an understanding of the need to move forward together with the civilized nations, would be the most important values.''
 No one recognized more than he how far short he fell of his goal. In his resignation speech, he told the Russian people: ''I ask forgiveness for not justifying some hopes of those people who believed that at one stroke, in one spurt, we could leap from the gray, stagnant, totalitarian past into the light, rich, civilized future.''
 At the end, he was a man worn down. ''I feel like a runner who has just completed a supermarathon of 40,000 kilometers,'' he wrote in his memoir. ''I gave it my all. I put my whole heart and soul into running my presidential marathon. I honestly went the distance. If I have to justify anything, here is what I will say: If you think you can do it better, just try. Run those 40,000 kilometers. Try to do it faster, better, more elegantly, or more easily. Because I did it.''

 CORRECTION:
An obituary yesterday about Boris N. Yeltsin, the former Russian leader, referred incorrectly to Anatoly B. Chubais, who along with Mr. Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana had persuaded Mr. Yeltsin not to outlaw the Communist Party, as Mr. Yeltsin later revealed in his memoir ''Midnight Diaries.'' Mr. Chubais was a former deputy prime minister, not a former prime minister.

HEADLINE: Mulally Names an Environmental Executive for Ford

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., April 23 

 BODY:
Not long ago, it would have been folly for an auto company chief executive to admit he believed in global warming, and just as unlikely for a carmaker to attach the word ''sustainability'' to a job title.
 But Ford Motor's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, did both on Monday. 
Speaking with journalists in a conference call, Mr. Mulally said, ''I clearly believe the vast majority of data indicates that the temperature has increased. And I believe the correlation and analysis that it's mainly because of greenhouse gases.''
 His comments came as Mr. Mulally announced a promotion for a Ford vice president, Susan M. Cischke, to a new job as senior vice president for sustainability, environment and safety engineering.
 Ms. Cischke, who now reports to Mr. Mulally instead of to Ford's Washington office, will be in charge of creating a long-range strategy on sustainability matters.
 The first executive at a Detroit auto company to have sustainability in her job title, she previously was vice president of environmental and safety engineering.
 She becomes the highest-ranking woman at Ford and the latest executive to take on an expanded role since Mr. Mulally became chief executive in September.
 The auto industry is facing the likelihood that it will be forced to make cars and trucks that achieve better gasoline mileage. On April 2 the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency had the authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from automobiles. The primary way that can be done, carmakers and environmentalists say, is to increase automobile fuel economy.
 As a result, Detroit carmakers, which have a long history of fighting regulations, are saying they want an active role in the movement to reduce the damage vehicles do to the environment.
 They may have little choice: lawmakers have introduced measures in Congress to raise federal fuel economy standards to as high as 40 miles a gallon, from the current standard of 27.5 miles a gallon for cars and 24 miles a gallon for light trucks.
 Likewise, the Bush administration is proposing a series of steps on the environment that include raising fuel economy by about one mile a gallon each year over the next few years.
 ''We can have it if we all work together,'' Mr. Mulally said Monday. 
 Ford has previously tried to position itself as an environmentally conscious company, especially when Mr. Mulally's predecessor, William Clay Ford Jr., was in charge, only to pull back on promises of building more efficient vehicles. 
 For example, it abandoned a pledge, made in 2000, to improve the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent by 2005. Last year Ford gave up on plans to sell 250,000 hybrid-electric vehicles each year by the end of the decade, saying instead that it would place greater emphasis on developing vehicles that can run on fuels other than gasoline, like E85, a mix of ethanol and gasoline. 
 Mr. Mulally acknowledged that Ford had made those vows before it had the technology to achieve them.
 ''On one hand, you have to give Ford credit for being a leader and for being out front originally,'' he said. ''On the other side, we're just seeing another recommitment of Ford that this is really important and we're going to make it a high priority of the company.''
 Representatives of environmental groups said that they were glad to see Mr. Mulally's latest steps but had not forgotten Ford's record.
 ''It's always good when we see a company making steps toward becoming more environmentally sustainable,'' said Mike Hudema, director of the Freedom From Oil Campaign, an alliance of three environmental groups. 
 ''But we do always have to put that in context with Ford's history,'' he said, ''which unfortunately on the environmental front is not a very good one.''
 Dan Becker, director of the global warming program at the Sierra Club, said Ford was good at making promises to help the environment but ''when it comes to doing them they seem to forget or fall down on the job.''
 He questioned whether Ms. Cischke was the right executive to focus on sustainability, saying that she had testified before Congress opposing steps the Sierra Club had proposed. ''It's as if the Yankees promoted manager Joe Torre to reach out to the Red Sox,'' he said.

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students discuss their perceptions about health issues and the role of their general physician. They design a plan to direct a group of physicians on how to be teenager-friendly and to best meet the health needs of teenagers and then pose and seek answers to health questions.
Author(s):
Catherine Hutchings, The New York Times Learning Network
Bridget Anderson, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour
Objectives:
1. Classify a list of health topics as "medical" or "social" and discuss students' perceptions about these issues.
 2. Reflect on the role of doctors, parents and patients in meeting the health needs of adolescents by discussing the article "In the Right Office, Trust and Candor."
 3. Design a plan, suggest strategies and create a list of adolescent health topics, with the goal of guiding physicians in how they may better serve teenagers. 
 4. Answer student-generated questions about issues relating to the health of adolescents using texts or online resources.
Resources / Materials:
-pens/pencils/markers
 -classroom board 
 -student journals
 -two slips of paper per student
 -poster boards
 -resources for researching health topics of interest to teenagers, including sexuality, drug use, fainting, depression, sports-related topics, etc.
 -copies of the article "In the Right Office, Trust and Candor," found online at (one per student)
Activities / Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Before students enter class, list health-related topics on the board. Include depression, body piercings, STD's, birth control, sports injury, asthma, exercise, diet and nutrition, feeling angry, poor grades, acne, stress management, colds and flus, lack of concentration, dizziness, drug use, anorexia, HPV vaccine, and prescription medicines. Then write the following prompt on the board: "In your journal, classify each one of these topics as either 'medical' or 'social.' Explain briefly why you chose to classify them in the way you did." When students enter class, have them spend five minutes writing a response to the prompt in their journals.
 Have students raise their hands if they classified a topic as 'medical' or 'social.' Tally the numbers on the board for each topic. Discuss topics that the class placed in both groups. Ask: "Would you choose to discuss this topic with your doctor? Why or why not? Does it make a difference if your parent or guardian was in the room or not? How do you think your doctor might respond to a question about these topics? What questions might you consider asking a doctor now that you wouldn't have thought to ask him or her before?"
 2. As a class, read and discuss the article "In the Right Office, Trust and Candor" (), focusing on the following questions: 
 a. According to the article, what helps make a family practice more welcoming to teenagers?
 b. What is meant by the phrase "setting the stage"? 
 c. According to Dr. John Santelli, what should parents look for in a doctor for their adolescent?
 d. Why might parents be reluctant to allow doctors to meet with their teenagers unsupervised?
 e. What health issues do teens generally not recognize as medical issues?
 f. The article states: "As a child becomes a teenager, the parent, doctor and patient relationship is bound to change, and that may be uncomfortable for everyone. But the old relationship may no longer serve the changing health needs of an adolescent." To what changing health needs is the article referring?
 g. Based on your experiences, how does attitude of the staff affect you during a doctor's visit? 
 h. Why do you think that "candor, trust, and confidentiality" are important in patient-doctor relationships? 
 i. What are the benefits of allowing adolescents to have time in the examining room without a parent?
 j. Has reading the article changed your opinion about the sort of things you can tell or ask your physician? If so, how? If not, why not?
 3. Divide the class into small groups of two to three students. Tell the groups to imagine that they have been commissioned by a practice of doctors specializing in adolescent medicine in their area to help redesign its office, educate its staff on how to be more teen-friendly, and advise the physicians on the health topics that teens are most concerned about.
 On poster board, each group must draw and present a design plan for the waiting area and examination rooms. They must also include a list of key health topics they want their physician to know about and be prepared to discuss with them. Finally, they should present some "do" and "don't" strategies for the doctors and staff that will help them promote a teen-friendly environment.
 Have groups reflect on their own experiences at the doctor and use the following guiding questions (copied into a handout) to design their plan and strategies:
 Waiting Area: What music is playing? How is the room decorated? What reading materials are available? How are you greeted by the office secretary or nurse? What signs are posted to help you know where to go and what to expect during your visit? How is the room specifically geared to teenagers rather than or in addition to young children? How are you treated during the wait?
 Examination: What is the exam experience like? What would you be embarrassed by? What would make you more comfortable? What health topics would you want your doctor to bring up? What pamphlets about health topics should be available? Is a parent, guardian or nurse present? Does the doctor suggest a time to talk without a parent present?
 Health professionals: Do they explain what they are doing? Do they allow you to ask questions? How could they make you feel comfortable? How would you prefer doctors and staff to dress? What health topics do you want your doctor to know a lot about or have a lot of information on? (Make a list of 5-10.) How should doctors address sensitive topics? How does the doctor "set the stage" for the parent/patient/doctor dynamic?
 When the groups are finished, they should display their posters around the room. Invite students to circulate and look at each poster. Then, after students retake their seats, have the class discuss what elements are common among the groups. Ask: "Which design elements should go onto a "Top Ten" or "Best Practices" list? What are the most important health topics to teenagers? What "do's" and "don'ts" should doctors and staff absolutely implement and follow?"
 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Before the end of class, distribute two slips of paper to each student. Based on their list of health topics, each student writes two anonymous questions (one on each slip of paper) he or she would like to ask a physician, and place them in a large bowl.
 Instruct each student to draw two questions from the bowl. They should choose one of the two questions to research for the following class period, and replace the other two questions. Students should use all available, reliable resources to prepare an answer to the question they chose, which will be posted in the room along with the question.
Further Questions for Discussion:
-According to its Web site, the American Academy of Pediatrics (), groups adolescents as those between the ages of 11 and 21. Why do you think this age gap is so broadly defined? In your opinion, should this be refined? Why or why not? 
 -In your opinion, are teenagers more or less embarrassed to discuss sensitive health topics than adults? Why do you think so? 
 -What suggestions would you have for a younger brother or sister who asks you a health-related question?
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on their responses to the Warm-Up activity, participation in the design activity, strategy and health topic suggestions, and a well-researched answer to a question on teenage health.
Vocabulary:
candor, pediatric, discerned, alienated, converses, dynamic, confidentiality, disclose, assured, sexuality, independently, reticent, depression, gynecological, clinic
Extension Activities:
1. Research one of the health topics discussed in the article and how it relates to teenagers. What are the facts about the topic? What misconceptions do many teenagers have about the topic? How can a doctor help educate you on the problem, risks and solutions to the problem? Prepare a presentation to share your findings with the class. Possible topics include depression, drug use, questions about sexuality, fainting or sports-related issues.
 2. Interview your doctor or a doctor specializing in adolescent medicine in your area about his or her attitudes toward teenagers and view of the parent/doctor/patient relationship. Before the interview, create a list of questions you plan to ask. Take notes during the interview, and write a summary describing the visit.
 3. The article states: "State laws vary, but if a patient says something in confidence, the doctor will generally disclose it only if there is a reason to think the patient or someone else is in danger of abuse or other serious harm." Research the laws in your state related to doctor and minor confidentiality and parent notification. Then, write a letter to your state representatives in support or opposition to a law. 4. Create a pamphlet for doctors to use to discuss the changing dynamic of office visits with young adolescents, ages 11 to 13.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Math - Make a list of health topics. Ask ten of your peers and ten adults to check which topics they would most likely ask a doctor about. Tally the results and make a bar graph to compare and contrast the differences and similarities between adolescent health needs and adult needs.
 Media Studies -- Which health topics are most commonly addressed in television, radio and Internet ads? Why do you think this is? How do pharmaceutical companies use the media to promote their products? Choose an ad relating to a health topic. Which age group does it target? What attitude does it encourage people to have toward health problems and doctors?
 Teaching with The Times -- Clip teenager-related health articles that appear in The Times (include news, feature, science, opinion and other types of articles). Post them on a class bulletin board. Leave space for your classmates to write comments about the articles. After a month, discuss the kinds of issues covered in the newspaper. Why do you think these topics were covered? What topics would you like to see covered in the future? To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.
 Technology -- Search for and read blogs on teenage health. Critique them based on their usefulness and their accuracy. How might blogs help to educate teenagers about sensitive topics? How confident can you be that the information you read on a blog is accurate? Compare the blog to other online resources. Then, choose your favorite health blog and write a submission to it.
Other Information on the Web:
The National Library of Medicine (http://www.nlm.nih.gov) provides health-related information for the public, including MedLine Plus, which offers a medical encyclopedia, dictionary and information about prescription and over-the-counter drugs.
 Health Finder (http://www.healthfinder.gov/kids) offers health resources for the public, including a separate resource site for kids that includes an extensive dictionary of health-related terms.

HEADLINE: Mommy Books: More Buzz Than Buyers

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
In the last few months, Monique Moen, a former actress and now a stay-at-home mother in Los Angeles, has bought several books: ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' by Kurt Vonnegut; ''A Room of One's Own'' by Virginia Woolf; ''Mistress of the Art of Death,'' a historical thriller by Ariana Franklin; and the latest James Patterson novel.
 But the book that prompted her to write a 1,200-word post on her blog, www.mommiesparadise.com, was ''The Feminine Mistake'' by Leslie Bennetts, which Ms. Moen has not read and has no intention of reading.
Having seen an article from HuffingtonPost.com by Ms. Bennetts and a review of the book, which argues that mothers who stay at home with their children are financially, emotionally and medically at risk, Ms. Moen believes that she knows enough about it to debate its premise. 
 ''I really think she laid out what she wrote about in the book in the article,'' Ms. Moen said. ''The whole article rubbed me the wrong way, so I'm not inclined to read the book.''
 Ms. Moen is one of dozens of women online who have tangled with what they perceive as Ms. Bennetts's message. Fueled by the author's appearance on the ''Today'' show, an excerpt in Glamour magazine, and reviews or interviews in Parade and People, these women are giving Ms. Bennetts the kind of cocktail-party stature (if these women, mostly mothers, had time for cocktail parties) to which many writers aspire.
 The explosion of commentary on blogs and elsewhere about ''The Feminine Mistake'' joins a growing list of similar fracases stirred up by books that touch on the perennial dilemma of mostly upper-middle-class women: return to work or stay at home with the kids. But the truth is that, with rare exceptions (and it's too early to say whether Ms. Bennetts's book may be one of them), these so-called mommy books fail to transform their talk-show and blogosphere buzz into book sales. Talk, it turns out, is much cheaper than the $24.95 cover price.
 ''There is a lot of discussion out there about this issue and that's why we're having these books,'' said Nancy Sheppard, vice president of marketing at Viking, which last year published ''Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World'' by Linda R. Hirshman. ''But it's mostly just a discussion.''
 Ms. Hirshman, who also argued that women should work outside the home to fulfill their human capacities and avoid economic dependency, appeared on ''Good Morning America'' and ''The Colbert Report'' after the book's release in June, and the blogosphere went wild. But her book sold only 4,000 copies, according to Nielsen BookScan, which accounts for about 70 percent of sales in stores and online.
 Nobody has matched the success of ''The Feminine Mystique,'' Betty Friedan's bombshell that exposed the dreariness of women's domestic lives and has sold about three million copies since it first appeared in 1963. Judith Warner's ''Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety'' has been described as a recent success because it sold 37,000 copies in hardcover and hit the New York Times hardcover nonfiction best-seller list for three weeks. (After publication, Ms. Warner became a columnist for TimesSelect, the paid Web site of The New York Times, and a contributor to the Op-Ed page.)
 Recent mommy books that have not lived up to the promise of their publicity include Sylvia Ann Hewlett's ''Creating a Life: Professional Women and the Quest for Children,'' which sold only 11,000 copies in hardcover and 2,000 in paperback, according to BookScan, despite the book's appearance on ''60 Minutes,'' ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' and the covers of Time and New York magazines.
 And last year Caitlin Flanagan's ''To Hell With All That: Loving and Loathing Our Inner Housewife,'' a collection of essays that said, among other things, that when a woman works, something is lost, generated a media and Internet frenzy, but sold only 9,000 copies in hardcover, according to BookScan. 
 What is striking about these limp sales figures is that these books cover a topic that raises fierce passions, as anyone who has spent time on a playground or near an office water cooler knows. But that may get at the heart of why women are not buying books about these subjects. 
 ''I always felt it was something that women didn't want to look at too closely,'' said Jonathan Burnham, publisher of HarperCollins, who was editor in chief at Talk Miramax Books when Ms. Hewlett's book, which suggested that women who pursued high-powered careers could end up childless, was published five years ago. ''It was a problem that touched very complicated feelings, so while they read a magazine article or watched a segment on 'Oprah,' they didn't want to read a whole book about it because it was such a difficult subject.''
 It also may be that in the absence of any policy changes making the lives of mothers easier, people are more interested in venting their frustrations than in reading another book. Because it's such an unresolved issue, women have a ''desperate need to express their feelings and have a discussion,'' Naomi Wolf, the feminist writer, said. ''You don't really need to buy a book to do that.''
 Ms. Bennetts, who interviewed hundreds of people, including mothers, economists and sociologists, and marshaled a broad array of statistics for ''The Feminine Mistake,'' said she didn't understand why the people who have posted inflammatory comments about the book weren't willing to buy it and find out what she has to say. Some have even taken to personal attacks, with one blogger discrediting Ms. Bennetts because of her weight. 
 ''Among full-time homemakers, this overdeveloped capacity for denial is often accompanied by a highly combative sense of indignation about views that challenge their own,'' Ms. Bennetts wrote in a HuffingtonPost.com article. 
 In an interview Ms. Bennetts, who worked at The New York Times for 10 years before moving to Vanity Fair, where she is now a contributing editor, added that the negative blog posts do not reflect the many positive responses she has personally received. ''We've got this incredible response from working women who are just about euphoric about the fact that somebody has finally written that not only are you not a bad mother, but you are providing for your kids in really crucial ways,'' Ms. Bennetts said. 
 Ms. Bennetts said she even received a call early one Saturday morning from a stay-at-home mother who told her: '' 'I didn't realize how depressed and unhappy I've been until I read your book.' She said, 'I swear to God, I think you've saved my life.' ''
 At Barnes & Noble, Mike Ferrari, a director of merchandising, said the book is ''selling extremely well.'' 
 Still, some booksellers say sales have not taken off. ''I really expected more than what we're seeing,'' given the publicity, said Cathy Langer, lead book buyer for the Tattered Cover bookstores in Denver. ''We bought, thinking it would move a little faster, a little bigger.'' So far, according to BookScan, ''The Feminine Mistake,'' which went on sale on April 3, has sold 5,000 copies. 
 Ellen Archer, publisher of Voice, a new imprint of Hyperion directed at women that published ''The Feminine Mistake,'' said the book is already in its fourth printing, with 42,000 copies. ''This is a book that's going to build over time through word of mouth,'' Ms. Archer said. ''There are many business books that sell hundreds of thousands of copies that never hit any best-seller lists, but they endure over time and become classics in their category.''
 Some authors say that book sales are not the only goal. Ms. Hirshman, who wrote a shortened version of her book for the online site of American Prospect magazine six months before the book's release, said the book was just a platform for getting her ideas into the ether.
 ''I guess the media world has changed in such a way that a book is just a pretext for television appearances and blogging and writing for The New Republic,'' Ms. Hirshman said. ''If the world is divided into people who don't need my message and women who don't want to hear it, it's a miracle I sold any books.''
 But for many busy mothers, it is simply the only-so-many-hours-in-the-day factor. ''I'm home-schooling, I have three children, and my reading time is limited,'' said Heather Cushman-Dowdee of Los Angeles. With many of the mommy books, she said, ''I think I get their points through the articles that they're writing without needing to delve in.'' Declining to buy the books, she said, is a way to ''protect your sanity a little bit.''

HEADLINE: Staten Island Considers New Plans To Keep Its Youth From Leaving

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
To reverse the flow of younger people leaving Staten Island, the borough should entice developers to build more affordable apartments close to the ferry, according to a study released yesterday.
 The St. George neighborhood near the ferry to Manhattan is the closest thing to a downtown district in the borough, but it lacks the vibrancy of other sections of New York City that have become havens for young professionals and artists, said Jonathan Bowles, who wrote the study for the Center for an Urban Future, a public policy group.
What is needed, the study said, is an immediate change in zoning rules, which have prevented more dense developments near the waterfront. 
 ''If Staten Island is going to hang on to its young people and attract young professionals from elsewhere, it's going to have to have a dynamic neighborhood with new amenities,'' said Mr. Bowles, who presented the center's findings at a conference of the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation, which commissioned the study. ''In a lot of ways, Staten Island is doing very well right now, but under the hood there are a number of mounting problems.'' 
 Staten Island is the city's fastest-growing borough. That growth has produced new woes, Mr. Bowles said, like rapidly rising housing prices, congested roads and a shortage of high-paying jobs. The lack of a comprehensive plan to solve those problems is very likely to continue driving younger people away, he said.
 In the 1990s, the borough's population increased by 17 percent to about 450,000, but the number of residents ages 18 to 34 decreased by 5 percent, according to the study. That shift reduced the share of residents ages 18 to 34 to fewer than 23 percent from about 28 percent. Many of those who left moved to New Jersey.
 Even opponents of rapid development of the borough support revitalizing the St. George area. John V. Luisi, a lawyer who lives in the neighborhood and waged an unsuccessful campaign for borough president in 2005, said developers should be encouraged to build more apartments and stores within a short walk of the ferry terminal, the island's transit hub.
 ''There's a general consensus that we'd like to achieve a critical mass of people in the area and attract appropriate retailing, such as a supermarket,'' Mr. Luisi said, citing the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, with its large Fairway store, as a model.
 But developers have been stymied by recent zoning changes that were aimed at curbing sprawl in other parts of Staten Island, which have been filled with tightly packed complexes of town houses, business leaders said.
 ''The borough's basically been turned into a borough for more expensive one- and two-family detached homes,'' said R. Randy Lee, a builder and the chairman of the economic development corporation.
 From 2000 to 2006, the median price of a single-family home on the island doubled to $425,000, according to the study.
 Mr. Lee is leading the push for the borough to draft a comprehensive master plan that would direct future growth to appropriate areas. A master plan is one of the recommendations in the center's study and Staten Island's members of the City Council plan to call for each borough to have its own master plan.
 But that idea does not have the support of Daniel L. Doctoroff, a deputy mayor, who appeared at the conference to promote Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's broad vision for the city. 
 ''We've done a lot of the master-planning for Staten Island,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''We're doing it in chunks. We don't think we need one comprehensive plan. What we have found is the one big plan typically will die of its own weight.''
 Mr. Doctoroff said that City Hall would help in looking for ways to solve Staten Island's traffic and transit problems. The borough has the longest average commuting times in the metropolitan region, with some residents -- many of whom work in Manhattan -- spending three hours a day getting to and from their jobs.
 Earlier in the day, Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, announced at the conference that the city would pay $350,000 for the study of a light-rail system that would run along the island's West Shore and across the Bayonne Bridge to connect to New Jersey Transit's tracks in Hudson County.
 ''It's definitely feasible,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''It's definitely something worth looking into, which is why we're looking at it.''

HEADLINE: Columbia Sprinter Faces Olympic Choice

BYLINE: By JOSHUA ROBINSON

 BODY:
Erison Hurtault is in demand. A senior at Columbia University, he has a New York investment bank offering him a full-time job, the Commonwealth of Dominica trying to put a relay baton in his hand and several people trying to persuade him to do both.
 At 22, he is the fastest 400-meter sprinter in Columbia history and an indoor track all-American. He has swept the event in each of the seven Ivy League championship meets of his career. 
''I don't think you can argue that anyone has been better in the Ivies in any four-year span,'' Columbia Coach Willy Wood said. 
 With only a few meets left, including this weekend's Penn Relays, and with life after college track ahead, Hurtault has the opportunity to take his running career as far as the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
 ''There are a lot of options, but it's really going to depend on how fast I run this year,'' Hurtault said. ''Running for Dominica would be fun. I'd be able to run at the world championships this year and the Olympics next year.''
 Although he grew up in New Jersey, Hurtault qualified for citizenship in Dominica because of his parents. They would like to see him take running as far he can.
 ''I've always wanted to go to the Olympic Games,'' Hurtault's father, Arnold, said. ''But I never thought I'd go as a parent.''
 Until last March at the indoor nationals, Hurtault never thought he had a chance. But after a season of continually improving on his Columbia records, he was noticed by Jerome Romain, a former triple jumper now coaching at Brown. Romain was also among the first athletes to represent Dominica at the Olympics, in 1996.
 Romain convinced Hurtault that he could easily earn a spot on the team, particularly because Dominica, an island nation in the Caribbean, has never fielded a 400-meter runner or a 4x400-meter relay team in the Olympics. Dominica's national trainers wanted Hurtault to compete at last year's Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, but the event overlapped the collegiate season.
 ''If he really wants to get the experience of the Pan-American Games, the world championships and obviously the ultimate reward of the Olympic Games, then, with the way he's running right now, he's a shoo-in,'' Romain said in a telephone interview. 
 Dominica, unlike theUnited States, does not have trials for its Olympic team. So running the 400 meters in 45.6 seconds would be enough for Hurtault to compete for Dominica. All season, he has been getting faster. A time of 45.99 at the Miami Elite Invitational on April 14 was his latest personal best. (He has also set a personal record in the 800 this season and wants to do the same in the 200.)
 ''The way we set up his training schedule was so that he would be at his best in early June for N.C.A.A.'s,'' Wood said. ''So what's been happening has been completely expected, and he should continue to improve.''
 Whatever progress Hurtault makes is unlikely to match that of three seasons ago. When he arrived at Columbia, he was clocking 48.3 seconds in the 400. But late in his first season, his times plummeted, and by the summer's end he had chopped off two seconds.
 ''I have no idea how I did it,'' he said. ''I didn't think I'd make it to nationals, but my time dropped another half-second at regionals. Suddenly I had the third-fastest time of all freshmen in the country.''
 Around the same time, Hurtault, an economics major, set himself on an investment-banking career track. After an internship in New York last summer, he was offered a full-time job upon graduation.
 ''I'm speaking to a lot of people there, but I'm trying to put that stuff off for as long as I can,'' he said. ''I don't want to jump in and then have something big happen with running. So I think I'm going to take my time throughout the summer and see what happens.''
 To make the decision more difficult, competing for Dominica would likely mean having to train and compete while working. To make it worthwhile, Hurtault said he needed to break the 45-second mark. 
 ''If I run 45, then I'm in really good shape,'' he said. ''I could run in New York, and it would be easier financially. Running for Dominica is a good option to have open, but I don't know exactly what I would do with it yet. Half a second in my time could make a big difference.''
 His coach keeps telling him that he has his whole life to work on Wall Street, Hurtault said. 
 ''So if I'm going to try and run, I can't wait five years,'' he said. ''I've got to do it now.''

HEADLINE: Middle-Class Squeeze Comes With Nuances

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
There are two different stories people tend to tell when they're trying to explain why the middle class is feeling squeezed.
 The first one is about inequality. The top 0.1 percent of earners -- that's one taxpayer out of every 1,000 -- now brings in 11 percent of the nation's total income, triple the share that they did just a generation ago. This has happened because the rich have grown ever richer, while the pay of rank-and-file workers hasn't risen much faster than inflation.
The second, related story is about instability. Layoffs seem to happen more frequently than they once did, and these job losses -- combined with the spread of bonus pay -- have caused workers' incomes to bounce around a lot more than in the past. So not only have middle-class families been getting meager raises, their finances have also become more volatile.
 The story about inequality is indisputably true. But we're starting to learn that the second story, the one about instability, is more complicated. It may even end up being wrong. 
 There is now a big push in both Washington and state capitals to come up with policies that can alleviate middle-class anxiety. That's all for the good. In fact, it is overdue. If it's going to succeed, however, it will have to focus on the actual causes of the squeeze. 
 Last week, the Congressional Budget Office released a study that was arguably the fullest picture of economic volatility anyone has yet put together. Although some academics have taken a crack at the topic in recent years, they have had to rely on surveys in which people are asked how much money they make. The study by the C.B.O., as the budget office is known, used Social Security Administration records, which cover many more people than the surveys and are more reliable. 
 If you read the C.B.O. report, you can tell that its authors knew they were dealing with a delicate subject. The summary starts by noting that a ''significant number of workers experience substantial variability in their total wage earnings,'' which is certainly true. Only later do you come to the surprising part: there is the same amount of variability now that there was in the 1980s and 1990s. In journalism, this is known as burying the lead.
 ''Intuitively, you would think volatility is increasing,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who along with Senator Jim Webb of Virginia requested that the study be done. ''But it isn't, which I guess shows that the American economy has always been very flexible.''
 Mr. Schumer's point about intuition is an important one. We can all tick off reasons that the economy feels so volatile. Hardly a week goes by without another big corporation -- the Tribune Company, Citigroup, DaimlerChrysler -- announcing a big job cut. The number of temporary jobs, meanwhile, has mushroomed. Globalization and technological innovation are causing many of these changes, and labor unions are too weak to prevent them. 
 But there is also a whole set of other forces, harder to see and pushing in the other direction. Manufacturing, where furloughs and layoffs have always been the norm, accounts for a much smaller part of the work force than it used to, while more stable industries, like health care, have grown. This is one reason that recessions, and the job cuts they bring, haven't happened as often as they once did.
 Yesterday's layoffs could go unnoticed by people who weren't affected by them because they were a regular part of doing business. Today's tend to come in big chunks and are often announced in news releases. ''There have always been a lot of mass layoffs,'' said Lawrence F. Katz, a labor economist at Harvard. ''We didn't count them before.'' 
 In fact, research by Henry S. Farber, an economist at Princeton, has found that job loss rates have followed a cyclical pattern since the early '80s, peaking around the same highs during recessions and falling to similar lows during expansions. (The rate has risen for workers who went to college and fallen a bit who those who didn't.)
 Americans, looking at their own jobs, realize that there hasn't been a big change: in a recent Gallup Poll, 12 percent of respondents said it was very or fairly likely they would be laid off in the coming year. In the 1970s, '80s and '90s, at similar points in the business cycle, the percentage was virtually identical.
 I don't want to exaggerate how much we know about instability, because there are some conflicting signals. Mr. Farber has also found, for instance, that average job tenure has declined during this time. Maybe people are more willing to leave a job voluntarily -- or maybe companies nudge more workers out the door with early retirements and other stealth layoffs. 
 The C.B.O., for its part, has looked only at the pay of individual workers. In the future, economists there will look at family income -- which is affected by divorce and other factors -- and could potentially find changes there, as some academic work has. 
 The bottom line, though, is that the picture is likely to look mixed. Volatility may or may not have increased over the last generation, but it does not appear to have changed in a fundamental way.
 Inequality is a whole different story. It has risen enormously and is not about to stop. With the recent jump in gas prices, the pay of rank-and-file workers is once again failing to keep pace with inflation, just as it did from 2002 until early last year, despite healthy economic growth.
 In fact, inequality is probably the real reason that the economy often feels more volatile. When people are stretched -- when their pay has been stagnant, when they're worried about health insurance, when they don't know what the future holds -- a jolt to their income is harder to handle. 
 As the C.B.O. pointed out, these jolts do happen a lot, even if they don't happen more than in the past. In 2003, a whopping 20 percent of workers saw their earnings drop 25 percent or more compared to the previous year. (For about 22 percent of workers, earnings rose at least 25 percent.) 
 But it's important to keep in mind what is really changing. As Mr. Schumer says, ''If you're holding a job but your share of the pie is getting smaller, that's a different set of policy needs than if you keep losing your job.''
 In an economy where volatility was the main problem, you might want to protect jobs by making it harder for companies to cut them. In an economy where inequality was the problem, you would want to protect people. You would help them pay for health insurance, retirement, their children's education and other basic needs when the market, left to its own devices, was not doing so. 
 And if your resources were limited, wouldn't you start with the problem you were sure that you had?

HEADLINE: At World Bank Meeting, Frustrations Boiled Over

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24 

 BODY:
At a meeting between Paul D. Wolfowitz and his top managers at the World Bank last week, Mr. Wolfowitz made an unusual confession. ''I understand that I've lost a lot of trust, and I want to build that trust back up,'' he said, according to people present.
 But the beleaguered bank president was immediately confronted by one of his top deputies, who asserted that Mr. Wolfowitz was wrong to think that the furor over his leadership sprang only from his handling of the pay and promotion for his companion or from unease over his support of the Iraq war while at the Pentagon.
Graeme Wheeler, the bank's managing director, said at the meeting that the fight over whether Mr. Wolfowitz should stay on at the bank amounted to the ''the biggest crisis in its history.'' 
 He said it arose from a range of issues, including fears that Mr. Wolfowitz and his aides were trying to impose Bush administration ideas on family planning and climate change at the bank and worries over a possible conflict of interest in the bank's hiring of a Washington law firm, Williams & Connolly, to investigate leaks. A partner at the firm had earlier negotiated Mr. Wolfowitz's employment contract with the bank. 
 Mr. Wheeler also said Mr. Wolfowitz's staying on would cause ''fantastic damage'' to the bank's reputation and effectiveness.
 The exchange, described in detail by people who attended the closed meeting, illustrated how far the turmoil surrounding Mr. Wolfowitz has spread since it erupted in public a few weeks ago. It also revealed his determination to remain on the job and the deep wellspring of antipathy toward him among the bank's board and senior staff.
 With the hiring of Robert S. Bennett, a prominent lawyer, to defend his record before the board, Mr. Wolfowitz has effectively revealed that his hope is to play for time, overhaul his management team and plead that a hasty exit would be disruptive to the bank, especially since he was not planning to stay for more than three more years anyway.
 According to the people at the meeting last week, the vice presidents were startled when Mr. Wolfowitz said he might not even be at the bank for another year, though this was not said to be a sign that he would resign, only that a fight over whether he should stay was not worth the trouble.
 Mr. Wolfowitz has promised to mend his ways and has warned that a forced ouster would damage the bank. But it has become clear that there is a larger sense of unease, especially among Europeans, about American influence over the bank and its strategies toward ending poverty. There is also tension between the United States and Europe over who is to blame for the shortfall in commitments to raise $30 billion to reach that goal. 
 ''There is no one issue that is motivating people,'' said Robert B. Holland III, a Texas businessman who served as the United States member of the bank's board until last year and who is a strong supporter of Mr. Wolfowitz. ''There is a built-in ideological opposition to Wolfowitz that was there from day one. The opposition has been looking for any opportunity to exploit to get him out of there.''
 Mr. Holland said that Mr. Wolfowitz had sought from the outset to trim the bank's bureaucracy and enforce new standards of honesty in countries receiving bank assistance.
 But such steps as cutting off money to programs and countries suspected of graft alienated two groups of officials: the bank's 24-member board of directors, which runs the bank's daily affairs in tandem with Mr. Wolfowitz, and a group of 30 or so vice presidents and their equivalent. 
 Early in his tenure, Mr. Wolfowitz suspended $1 billion in funding for a program providing health services, including maternal health, to India. That enraged aides to Prime Minister Tony Blair, since Britain was helping to fund the program. 
 The board then stepped in to rewrite Mr. Wolfowitz's approach on corruption. Last month, it promulgated an anticorruption policy that handcuffed Mr. Wolfowitz by preventing him from acting to freeze programs without consultation and by asserting that the bank would not finance groups in countries over the objections of their governments.
 The corruption issue exposed a cleavage at the bank between Mr. Wolfowitz, who initially wanted to make ''governance'' a priority equal to, or even ahead of, poverty alleviation, and Europeans who argued that poverty alleviation must trump all other considerations. 
 The people who agreed to describe the closed meeting of vice presidents last week would do so only when promised anonymity. The descriptions were provided both by critics and defenders of Mr. Wolfowitz, who said they wanted to ensure that the public got an accurate account of the proceedings.
 Those who attended the meeting said that Mr. Wheeler, the managing director, did not raise the issue of the anticorruption agenda, but that the residue of the battles on that issue continued to be felt. Mr. Wheeler said that if Mr. Wolfowitz did not resign, bank staff and colleagues would direct their ire at the board of directors and also the finance ministries around the world for not taking action against him.
 The board is studying whether Mr. Wolfowitz violated bank rules in arranging a pay-and-promotion package for Shaha Ali Riza, his companion, and whether she violated bank rules in traveling to Iraq in 2003 as a temporary employee of a defense contractor.
 Mr. Bennett, the lawyer, is seeking to make the case that Mr. Wolfowitz's role in arranging the package when Ms. Riza was detailed to the State Department in 2005 was not a ''hanging offense.'' But he has apparently failed in his effort to persuade the bank board to give Mr. Wolfowitz more time to make his case on the matter of Ms. Riza. 
 ''I have heard that the board is not inclined to meet with me,'' Mr. Bennett said in an interview. ''I'm very concerned about that because I think there's a lot of bad information out there, and I want to make sure the board has all the information, some of which I believe is exculpatory.''
 A new indication of how deep the divisions are over Mr. Wolfowitz surfaced Tuesday. The bank board met to give support to a broad strategy on maternal health policies and got into a wrangle with the American director, Eli Whitney Debevoise II, over language referring to comprehensive reproductive ''services,'' which some equate with abortion.
 Bank officials said that word of the dispute touched off a new round of e-mail messages and telephone calls at the bank, with most officials charging that the United States was trying to impose a conservative agenda on bank policies. Mr. Wolfowitz, seeking to allay suspicions on this issue, has told many bank officials that he favors all aspects of the bank's family planning approaches.
 By the end of the day, some bank officials said that the dispute had been resolved, and the word ''services'' stayed in the paper. 
 There were few details on Tuesday of what changes in his management team Mr. Wolfowitz might make. Bank officials said he had told colleagues that he might bring in a senior operating officer or even a ''coach'' to help him manage the bank without alienating people.
 This was apparently a reference to what some said was an abrasive style by some of his aides. Officials said he also told the bank vice presidents last week that although many of them distrusted him, he regarded them as his top aides and looked to them for leadership on helping him run the bank.
 He was said to have told the vice presidents that his future was now in the hands of the bank board, but his assumption was that at the end of the process, ''I'll be here.''

HEADLINE: Group Proposes Detailed Plan To Reduce Poverty by Half

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
With a large increase in the minimum wage and a handful of other measures to raise the income of low-end workers, the United States could cut the number of people living in poverty by half within a decade, a report from a liberal research group says. 
 The antipoverty strategy, which would cost the government $90 billion a year, was developed over the last year by a group of economists, poverty experts and leaders of labor and community groups. It is to be issued today by the Center for American Progress in Washington. It is likely to be a fount of ideas for Congress, where Democratic control has led to new interest in fighting poverty and for candidates, especially Democrats, in the presidential campaign.
According to federal data, 37 million residents lived below the poverty line in 2005, defined as an income of $20,000 a year for a family of four. 
 The new strategy reflects a change in the political climate since the welfare overhaul of 1996. That put strict limits on cash welfare that many experts said had reduced incentives to work. The new strategy emphasizes measures to promote work and would use tax credits and other measures to bolster the incomes of low-wage workers. 
 Peter B. Edelman, a co-chairman of the group and a professor of law at Georgetown University who advised the Clinton administration on social policy, cited the antipoverty initiatives of Mayors Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, a Republican, and Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, a Democrat, as evidence of a growing and widely shared concern. 
 Many of the proposals in the report seem unlikely to fly unless a Democrat is in the White House. 
 The panel argues that although the $90 billion price tag may appear unrealistic amid the current Congressional stalemate over taxes, rescinding tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans would free more than the required dollars.
 Other experts, including Douglas Besharov, a public policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, say that even the Democrats will be divided on using any money freed by tax changes and that reducing the alternative minimum tax for the middle class may, for example, have a higher priority than the proposed strategy. 
 Citing studies by the Urban Institute, the report says steps in three areas, costing the government $50 billion a year, would reduce poverty 26 percent, or nine million people. 
 First is an increase in the minimum wage to half the average hourly wage. Congress has just agreed to raise the minimum wage, to $7.25 an hour by 2009 from its current $5.15 an hour. By the report's standard, the wage would have reached $8.40 in 2006 and be higher in future years. 
 Research indicates that such an increase would eliminate a relatively small number of jobs, the institute said, while lifting the incomes of more than 4.5 million poor workers and nine million people whose incomes are just above the poverty line. 
 Second, the report calls for expanding the earned-income tax credit and the child care credit. The earned-income tax credit for childless workers and noncustodial parents, in particular, which is now negligible, would increase along with credits for working families. That would reduce the number of poor by two million. 
 Third, expanding child care subsidies for families with incomes below $40,000 a year and expanding the child care tax credit would raise employment and help lift nearly three million people out of poverty, the study forecasts.

HEADLINE: Off to Work She Should Go

BYLINE: By Linda Hirshman. 
Linda Hirshman is the author of ''Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World.''

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
THE United States Bureau of Labor Statistics recently published its long-awaited study, ''Trends in Labor Force Participation of Married Mothers of Infants.'' ''In recent years,'' the number crunchers reported, ''the labor force participation of married mothers, especially those with young children, has stopped its advance.'' 
 Sixty percent of married mothers of preschool children are now in the work force, four percentage points fewer than in 1997. The rate for married mothers of infants fell by about six percentage points, to 53.5 percent. The bureau further reports that the declines ''have occurred across all educational levels and, for most groups, by about the same magnitude.'' 
In sum, sometime well before the 2000 recession, wives with infants and toddlers began leaving the work force. And they stayed out even after the economy began to revive.
 For several years, experts have been arguing about the ''opt-out'' revolution -- the perception that there has been an exodus of young mothers from the work force. Heather Boushey of the Center for Economic and Policy Research called the opt-out revolution a myth, and asserted that married mothers don't drop out any more than other women in a bad economy. The new report is strong evidence that something really is going on.
 Why are married mothers leaving their jobs? The labor bureau's report includes some commonsense suggestions, but none that fully explains the situation. New mothers with husbands in the top 20 percent of earnings work least, the report notes. As Ernest Hemingway said, the rich do have more money. So they also have more freedom to leave their jobs. But why do they take the option? It's easier in the short term, sure, but it's easier to forgo lots of things, like going to college or having children at all. People don't -- nor should they -- always do the easier thing.
 The authors also speculate that the pressure of working and running a household is great. They do not say, however, that working hours have increased as participation has declined. Educated women, they report, work 42.2 hours a week on average and those with professional degrees, 45 -- hardly the ''80-hour week'' of legend.
 Poorer mothers can less afford child care, and because they earn less, their opportunity costs of not working are lower, the authors suggest. But for these women, lost income cuts deeper. And this factor, like the average number of hours worked, has not changed since 1997. 
 What has changed in the last decade is that the job of motherhood has ramped up. Mothers today spend more time on child care than women did in 1965, a time when mothers were much less likely to have paying jobs, family scholars report. 
 The pressure to increase mothering is enormous. For years, women have been on the receiving end of negative messages about parenting and working. One conservative commentator said the lives of working women added up to ''just a pile of pay stubs.'' When the National Institute of Child Health reported recently that long hours in day care added but a single percentage point to the still-normal range of rambunctious behavior in children, newspaper headlines read, ''Day Care, Behavior Problems Linked in Study.'' 
 Should we care if women leave the work force? Yes, because participation in public life allows women to use their talents and to powerfully affect society. And once they leave, they usually cannot regain the income or status they had. The Center for Work-Life Policy, a research organization founded by Sylvia Ann Hewlett of Columbia, found that women lose an average of 18 percent of their earning power when they temporarily leave the work force. Women in business sectors lose 28 percent.
 And despite the happy talk of ''on ramps'' back in, only 40 percent of even high-powered professionals get back to full-time work at all.
 That the most educated have opted out the most should raise questions about how our society allocates scarce educational resources. The next generation of girls will have a greatly reduced pool of role models. 
 But what is to be done? Organizations like Moms Rising and the Mothers Movement Online have stepped up the pressure for reforms like flexible work hours and paid parental leave. Such changes probably would help lower-income women in the most unforgiving workplaces. But they are unlikely to affect the behavior of the highly educated women with the highest opt-out rates. 
 We could make an effort to change men's attitudes. Sociologists have found that mothers (rich and poor) still do twice the housework and child care that fathers do, and even the next generation of males say they won't sacrifice work for home. But in the short term, it might be easier to change the tax code.
 In most American marriages, wives earn less than their husbands. Since the tax code encourages joint filing (by making taxes lower for those who do), many couples figure that the ''extra'' dollars the wife brings in will be piled on top of the husband's income and taxed at the highest rates, close to 50 percent, according to estimates made by Ed McCaffery, a tax professor at the University of Southern California. Considering the cost of child care, couples often conclude that her working adds nothing to the family treasury.
 If married couples were taxed as the separate income earners they often are, women would be liberated from some of the pressure to reduce their ''labor force participation,'' as the labor bureau would say.
 Labor statistics are always couched in such dry language, but it reveals a powerful reality: working mothers, rich and poor, struggle with their competing commitments. Now that we have seen the reality, it is time to address it.

HEADLINE: Trade Surplus Tops Forecast in Japan

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, April 25 

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus rose more than expected in March from a year earlier as exports climbed despite a slowdown in the United States economy, data showed on Wednesday. 
 Contributing to a sharp expansion in the surplus was a slowdown in growth of imports, largely because of falling crude oil prices and a fall in imports of clothing from China.
The trade surplus rose 73.9 percent in March from a year earlier, to 1.6335 trillion yen ($13.78 billion), above economists' median forecast for a surplus of 1.3458 trillion yen, the ministry of finance reported.
 ''Exports are strong despite a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which shows that Japan's economy continues to get solid support from external demand,'' said Noriaki Haseyama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
 Some economists have been wary that a slowdown in the United States economy, which is still largely limited to the housing sector, could dent American demand for Japanese goods.
 Exports, which account for about 15 percent of Japan's economy, grew 10.2 percent from a year earlier to a record 7.51 trillion yen, in part because of increases in the shipments of autos and semiconductors.
 Exports to the United States, Japan's largest export destination, grew 2.4 percent from a year earlier, rising for the 26th month. Exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, climbed 15.1 percent to 1.12 trillion yen.
 Imports in March were flat from the year ago at 5.88 trillion yen.

HEADLINE: Building Owners' Costs Rose in Last Year, but So Did Revenues

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
The cost of operating the apartment houses that hold the city's more than one million rent-stabilized apartments rose by 5.1 percent in the last year -- less than in the previous year, the Rent Guidelines Board reported yesterday. And while building owners' costs grew at a faster rate than their income, their revenue after operating expenses were paid still increased.
 Those findings, in two reports by the rent board's staff, will be used by the board in setting allowable rent increases for rent-stabilized apartments for the coming year. The board, made up of nine members appointed by the mayor, is scheduled to hold a preliminary vote on May 7, three public hearings, then a final vote on June 22. 
Last year, when owners' costs had risen by 7.8 percent, the board approved rent increases of 7.25 percent on two-year leases and 4.25 percent on one-year leases.
 The first of the reports, the price index of operating costs, measures changes in the cost of certain goods and services. It found that labor costs for landlords rose 8.1 percent, administrative costs 6.9 percent and utility costs 6.3 percent. Real estate taxes grew 5.8 percent, while insurance costs grew by just 1.9 percent and fuel costs by only 0.5 percent.
 The increase in taxes, based on city Department of Finance data, was smaller than the 7.8 percent rise a year earlier. So was the rise in fuel costs, which had gone up 20 percent in each of the two previous years. On the other hand, the rise in administrative costs -- fees paid to management companies, accountants and lawyers -- was the biggest since 1986.
 The second report released yesterday, the income and expense study, was based on statements filed annually with the city by building owners themselves. The filings from more than 11,500 buildings with rent-stabilized apartments showed that owners' income rose by 4.7 percent and their costs by 6 percent.
 Even so, their ''net operating income'' -- the earnings that remain after operating and maintenance expenses are covered but before income tax and debt service are paid -- grew by 1.6 percent. (Because income exceeds expenses, a smaller percentage increase in income can outweigh a larger percentage increase in expenses.)
 At a board meeting in Lower Manhattan, Steven J. Schleider, a member appointed to represent the interests of owners, said the fact that net operating income was not larger showed that rent-stabilized buildings ''are not the investment panacea'' that, he said, some suggest. ''There are alternative investments that surely could generate a higher income than these properties,'' he said.
 Adriene L. Holder, a rent board member appointed to represent tenants, said business writers had stated recently that rent-regulated properties continued to be a good investment. She said, ''No one else is guaranteed that kind of return on investment, and it's guaranteed because this board exists.''
 Noting that net operating income rose only in Manhattan but decreased elsewhere, Mr. Schleider retorted, ''I fail to see the guarantee.''
 The Rent Guidelines Board, which sets guidelines for the 1.043 million rent-stabilized apartments but not for the 43,000 apartments under rent control, uses the staff reports as the basis for a discussion of rent increases for the coming year. It also takes into consideration a study on income and affordability intended to shed light on how much rent New Yorkers can afford to pay.
 That report, released on April 12, found unemployment down, wages up and gross city product growing, but the household income of tenants in rent-stabilized apartments shrinking. Evictions were up, the number of homeless families moving into permanent housing was down, and fewer people on public assistance were being placed in jobs.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 12, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies on Tuesday about proposed tentative rent increases for New York City's one million rent-stabilized apartments included an outdated schedule for the board's final vote. It is now expected June 26, not June 22. The article also misstated the number of public hearings to be held on the increases. (The same error appeared in an article on April 25 about reports that building owners' costs and revenues rose in the last year.) There will be two hearings, not three.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin's Legacy Is Like Russia Itself

 BODY:
 To the Editor: 
 Re ''Boris N. Yeltsin, Reformer Who Broke Up the U.S.S.R. and Led Russia, Dies at 76'' (front page, April 24): 
 Boris N. Yeltsin was ''A Tale of Two Men.''
On the one hand, he was very brave and heroic, helping bring down Communism and install democracy and a free-market economy in Russia. He was a proud Russian nationalist who allowed the Soviet Union's former republics to become independent states. In addition, he sought closer ties with the West. 
 On the other hand, he exhibited many flaws and shortcomings. He allowed corruption to become rampant. After he took power, unemployment and the shortage of goods were widespread. He got Russia into the disastrous Chechen war. Under his reign, the status and power of Russia dramatically declined.
 When convenient, he used dictatorial and heavy-handed tactics. At times, one was almost tempted to ask, Will the real Boris Yeltsin please stand up? He was definitely a man of many contradictions and paradoxes. Kenneth L. Zimmerman Huntington Beach, Calif. April 24, 2007 To the Editor:
 Boris N. Yeltsin was often described as one would describe Russia itself: at his best, passionate, strong, courageous and proud; at his worst, quick-tempered, stubborn and suspicious. 
 We have a choice in remembering him. We can remember the Russian strongman who ordered an attack on his own Parliament, or we can remember the hero who bravely stood atop a tank in defiance of one of the most oppressive regimes in history, leading the Russian people toward the promise of a democratic future.
 In remembering Mr. Yeltsin's legacy in Russia, we must not forget our own struggles as a new democracy, including the near-extermination of the Native Americans and the Civil War. We also must ask ourselves, When bravery and political courage are called for today in our country, which of our leaders would stand on a tank and oppose conventional wisdom?

HEADLINE: People Who Feed Off Anarchy In Somalia Are Quick to Fuel It

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Mohammed Ibrahim and Yuusuf Maxamuud contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia.

DATELINE: GALKAYO, Somalia 

 BODY:
Beyond clan rivalry and Islamic fervor, an entirely different motive is helping fuel the chaos in Somalia: profit. 
 A whole class of opportunists -- from squatter landlords to teenage gunmen for hire to vendors of out-of-date baby formula -- have been feeding off the anarchy in Somalia for so long that they refuse to let go.
They do not pay taxes, their businesses are totally unregulated, and they have skills that are not necessarily geared toward a peaceful society.
 In the past few weeks, some Western security officials say, these profiteers have been teaming up with clan fighters and radical Islamists to bring down Somalia's transitional government, which is the country's 14th attempt at organizing a central authority and ending the free-for-all of the past 16 years. 
 They are attacking government troops, smuggling in arms and using their business savvy to raise money for the insurgency. And they are surprisingly open about it.
 Omar Hussein Ahmed, an olive oil exporter in Mogadishu, the capital, said he and a group of fellow traders recently bought missiles to shoot at government soldiers.
 ''Taxes are annoying,'' he explained.
 Maxamuud Nuur Muradeeste, a squatter landlord who makes a few hundred dollars a year renting out rooms in the former Ministry of Minerals and Water, said he recently invited insurgents to stash weapons on ''his'' property. He will do whatever it takes, he said, to thwart the government's plan to reclaim thousands of pieces of public property.
 ''If this government survives, how will I?'' Mr. Muradeeste said.
 Layer this problem on top of Somalia's sticky clan issues, its poverty and its nomadic culture, and it is no wonder that the transitional government seems to be overwhelmed by the same raw antigovernment defiance that has torpedoed earlier attempts at stabilizing the country.
 Granted, many of the transitional leaders acknowledge that they have made mistakes and that they have not played the clan politics as deftly as they could have. But they say they believe that there are some Somalis -- actually, many Somalis -- who will never go along with any program.
 ''Even if we turned Mogadishu into Houston, there would still be people resisting us,'' said Abdirizak Adam Hassan, chief of staff for Somalia's transitional president, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed. ''I'm talking about the guys bringing in expired medicine, selling arms, harboring terrorists. They don't have a clan name. They're a congregation of people whose best interests are served by no government.'' 
 In the past month, the resistance has intensified and more than 1,000 people have been killed or wounded as the country has sunk into its deepest crisis since the famine days of the early 1990s.
 Most of the victims are civilians, like Amina Abdullahi, who recently fled Mogadishu with two small children holding her hands and a baby tied to her back.
 ''I don't understand why this is such a problem,'' she said. ''If people don't like this government, can't they wait until there is an election and vote them out?'' 
 American diplomats had mostly shied away from Somalia since the infamous ''Black Hawk Down'' episode in 1993 when Somali militiamen shot down two American helicopters and killed 18 United States soldiers. But now the Americans are involved again, driven by a counterterrorism agenda and armed with a pledge of $100 million to rebuild the country.
 And it is exactly this kind of hefty support that is fueling the resistance's urgency, because the opportunists sense that this transitional government, more than any other, poses the biggest threat yet to the gravy days of anarchy. 
 Somalis are legendary individualists, and when the central government imploded in 1991, people quickly devised ways to fend for themselves.
 Businessmen opened their own hospitals, schools, telephone companies and even privatized mail services. Men who were able to muster private armies, often former military officers, seized the biggest prizes: abandoned government property, like ports and airfields, which could generate as much as $40,000 a day. They became the warlords. Many trafficked in guns and drugs and taxed their fellow Somalis. 
 Beneath the warlords were clan-based networks of thousands of people -- adolescent enforcers, stevedores, clerks, truck drivers and their families -- all tied into the chaos economy. Ditto for the freelance landlords and duty-free importers.
 Over the years, prominent members of the Hawiye clan, Mogadishu's biggest, have tried to cobble together a government and end this system. But they have failed every time. Though Somalia is notoriously fragmented among dozens of rival clans and subclans, and has been that way for centuries, clans alone did not seem to be the problem.
 ''It was the opportunists who didn't see a role for themselves in the future,'' said Mohammed Abdi Balle, an elder here in Galkayo, a city about 450 miles north of Mogadishu.
 Not all opportunists had the same agenda. Many in the business community became fed up with paying protection fees to the warlords and their countless middle-men.
 Business leaders then backed a grass-roots Islamist movement that drove the warlords out of Mogadishu last summer and brought peace to the city for the first time in 15 years.
 The Islamists seemed to be the perfect solution for the businessmen. They delivered stability, which was good for most business, but they did not confiscate property or levy heavy taxes. They called themselves an administration, not a government. 
 ''Our best days were under them,'' said Abdi Ali Jama, who owns an electrical supply shop in Mogadishu. 
 But then a radical wing took over, and the Islamists declared war on Ethiopia, which commands one of the mightiest armies in Africa. The Ethiopians, with covert American help, crushed the Islamist army in December and bolstered the authority of Somalia's transitional government in the capital. 
 Many residents initially welcomed the transitional government. But then it made some questionable calls that cut across clan and business lines. It abruptly closed ports and took over airfields belonging to Hawiye businessmen, denying them revenue they had been accustomed to receiving for years. Many Somalis began to worry that the transitional government, which includes elders from all of Somalia's clans, was being pushed around by the Darod, the clan of the transitional president and a historic rival to the Hawiye.
 At first, just a few Hawiye sub-clans -- mainly those connected to the Islamists -- took up arms. But as the government has moved to curtail the profiteering, business leaders say that more and more clans are embracing the rebel cause.
 For many Abgal, an influential subclan of the Hawiye, the last straw came in mid-March when the government raised port taxes by 300 percent. Mr. Ahmed, the olive oil exporter and an Abgal, said that after that, there was a mass Abgal defection to the insurgency. ''The government is trying to destroy business as we know it,'' he said.
 Despite attempts at a cease-fire between insurgents and government forces, the violence has raged virtually unabated in Mogadishu.
 And once again, the opportunists have stepped in. In some areas, displaced people are forced to pay a ''shade tax'' to local residents for resting under their trees.

HEADLINE: Jordan Palmer Looks to Make A Name For Himself

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
Jordan Palmer shops for his clothing at Goodwill stores, which seems a fitting way to introduce a quarterback prospect for whom the N.F.L. draft is a hand-me-down experience. 
 In 2003, the Cincinnati Bengals made Palmer's brother, Carson, a quarterback out of Southern California, the No. 1 pick in the draft. Four years later, the younger Palmer, a four-year starter at Texas-El Paso, is considered a probable second-day pick.
 Carson Palmer entered the 2003 draft weekend having already agreed to a contract with the Bengals that guaranteed him a $10 million signing bonus. Jordan Palmer heads into this weekend's draft with a guaranteed tee time for 36 holes with Carson on a golf course in Colorado, where their parents, Bill and Dana, own a home.
 If Palmer is at all burdened that his football career has not measured up to his brother's, he did not show it at the N.F.L. scouting combine in February. ''I don't think there is a huge difference,'' he said when asked about the inevitable comparisons. ''Besides that he's won a bunch of awards, he's really famous and he's really rich.'' 
 In the yearly shopping expedition that is the N.F.L. draft, Palmer described himself as a steal for a team that is not stuck on labels and recognizes, as he does, that some of the best picks can often be found off the gilded path. 
 ''I can't compete with Carson in a lot of areas,'' Palmer said recently over lunch at a sports bar not far from where he grew up in Mission Viejo, Calif. ''But I can compete with him for Super Bowls, because he hasn't won one of those yet. In the N.F.L., I want to be that guy who leads my team to a championship. That's my goal.''
 Palmer's dream is to be drafted by a team in the Bengals' division, the American Football Conference North, so he and his brother can oppose each other twice a year into the next decade. 
 ''If I could go anywhere, it'd be somewhere like Baltimore so I could play against Carson,'' he said. 
 Jordan Palmer is 6 feet 6 inches and 230 pounds, with broad shoulders and close-cropped, dirty blond hair that he usually keeps tucked underneath a baseball cap. He is the spitting image of Carson. 
 Not long ago, he was taking his girlfriend, Dottie O'Dell, to dinner when a stranger ran up to him, grabbed him by the arm, thrust a piece of paper in front of him and said, ''Carson, will you sign this for me?'' 
 Palmer politely shrugged off the autograph seeker, and according to O'Dell, said, ''No, no, I'm not him, but I get that a lot.'' He has been heard telling others who confuse him for his brother: ''I'm not an N.F.L. player. I'm unemployed and live with my parents.'' 
 It is the pared-down truth, but after this weekend he hopes his story changes. Palmer, 22, completed 65.7 percent of his passes last season for 3,595 yards and 26 touchdowns for the Miners (5-7), a Conference USA team. 
 Although his mechanics are exceptional, the same cannot be said of his accuracy; as a senior he was intercepted 14 times, the same number Brady Quinn had during his final two seasons at Notre Dame. 
 Mike Mayock, an NFL Network draft expert, said Palmer could be selected late in the fourth round, but more likely in the fifth or sixth. ''He's a bit of a project,'' Mayock said. ''In my opinion the whole interception-to-touchdown ratio has gotten blown out of proportion a little. If you watch tape a lot of the interceptions were not his fault.'' 
 Palmer, who conceded that he has a gambler's streak that he is working to tone down, does not dwell on things he cannot control. His focus, he said, was on being coachable, being a hard worker and being tough. ''I don't want people to think I'm content with my last name and being tall,'' he said. ''I love to compete and I want to be successful, and to do that I know I need to work hard every day to get better.'' 
 Ron Hudson, who recruited Palmer to play at Texas-El Paso before leaving to become the offensive line coach at Louisiana-Lafayette, called Palmer a one-of-a-kind person and a leader. 
 ''He's not ashamed to be a little different,'' Hudson said in a telephone interview. ''He has a swagger that comes not from arrogance, but from a leadership standpoint.'' 
 Hudson remembered how Palmer reached out to teammates who came from different backgrounds and was not afraid to confront players about behavior that could be considered detrimental to the team. ''He's the best leader I've seen bar none,'' he said. 
 As the draft nears, Hudson listens to those who question Palmer's decision-making and his reads. ''Will he make it in the N.F.L.?'' Hudson said. ''I don't know, but I've told people this: he will never embarrass anybody who brings him in.'' 
 Palmer acknowledged his second-hand sartorial style probably raises a few eyebrows in certain places he goes with O'Dell in Orange County, like the glitzy outdoor malls where consumers seem to spend a lot of time shopping for status. The dark, three-piece polyester suit that he considers one of his best Goodwill finds might not go over too well with the Hugo Boss crowd.
 During one of Carson's recent trips to Southern California, he and his brother played Torrey Pines, the public golf course outside San Diego. They were paired with two strangers from West Virginia, who happened to be wide-eyed Bengals fans. After trading stories and shots for 18 holes, the men told the Palmers they were surprised at how normal they were. 
 ''That's a bigger compliment than someone saying you're cool,'' said Jordan Palmer, who has no use for people who judge others by the clothes on their backs, the car in their garage or their family name. 
 ''I take what I do very seriously, but I don't take myself seriously,'' he said. 
 Palmer played second violin in the high school band and college football in West Texas as a way to forge an identity separate from his brother's. As he prepares to follow Carson into the N.F.L., Jordan's sense of self is stronger than his throwing arm. 
 ''He doesn't care what other people think,'' O'Dell, said. ''He is his own person.''

HEADLINE: Preserving Fossil Fuels And Nearby Farmland By Eating Locally

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
JESSICA ABEL may have gone to extremes when she collected seawater from Long Island Sound and boiled it down to make two cups of salt. But people who are determined to eat only food made within 100 miles, give or take, sometimes find themselves reaching for creative solutions.
 Ms. Abel and her husband, Matt Madden, cartoonists who work at home in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, have given three strictly enforced local-only dinner parties over the past year. A fourth scheduled for next month will feature fiddleheads, ramps, new fresh cheese and baby lamb.
''Last summer it was goat stew with peaches and onions, and in the middle of winter it was an all-butter, all-the-time meal,'' she said. ''We all missed white flour and sugar.'' 
 Ms. Abel and Mr. Madden are dabblers in a small but increasingly popular effort to return to a time before the average food item traveled 1,500 miles from farm to table. In that sense, the only thing new about the phenomenon is its name, locavore, which was coined two years ago in California. But the appearance of the word seems to have given shape to a growing subculture. Weeklong locavore challenges have been popping up all over the country, even in places like Minnesota and Vermont, where it would seem to be pretty hard to eat local foods in the dead of winter.
 Many drawn to the movement say they have been eating that way for years and had never thought about the implications beyond the flavor. ''Initially it was the taste thing for me,'' said Robin McDermott, who lives in Waitsfield, Vt., where locavores call themselves localvores. ''But now when I think about what it takes to get lettuce across the country so I can eat it in the middle of winter, between the fuel costs and the contribution all the transportation is making to global warming and climate change, I just can't do it. It's not sustainable and I don't want to contribute to it.''
 Those who think this is another harebrained scheme of the food fringe may be surprised to learn that locavores are poised to move into the mainstream. Barbara Kingsolver, the best-selling novelist, has written one of three books out this spring about eating locally. 
 ''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle'' (HarperCollins) recounts her family's adventures during the year they spent eating food raised in their corner of southwest Virginia. Her book and others are successors to several earlier books including ''Coming Home to Eat'' by Gary Paul Nabhan and ''Full Moon Feast: Food and the Hunger for Connection'' by Jessica Prentice, who coined the word locavore and founded the Web site locavores.com.
 Ms. Prentice's group claims to have started the grass-roots locavore challenges that sprang up in California in 2005. Participants exchange recipes and advice. 
 Some locavores follow the 100 Mile Diet, created by Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon, authors of the just-released ''Plenty'' (Harmony). They spent a year in British Columbia eating only food grown within a 100-mile radius. 
 It wasn't easy. Faced with potatoes, once again, for lunch, Ms. Smith recounts her feeling that ''I'd kill for a sandwich.'' When Mr. MacKinnon said he would make her one, she couldn't imagine what he had in mind because they had no local flour for bread. But soon enough he produced greenhouse-grown red peppers and fried mushrooms with goat cheese between two golden brown slices of something. Something turned out to be turnips.
 The authors held so strictly to their plan that when they eventually found locally grown wheat they took it even though it was filled with mouse droppings. Mr. MacKinnon painstakingly separated the droppings from the wheat with the edge of a credit card. 
 The plan outlined in Ms. Kingsolver's book is much less strict than the one in ''Plenty.'' The author said that in her attitude toward food she is something between a Puritan (''I'm going to be holy right now'') and a toddler (''I want absolutely everything every minute and the idea of not having fresh peaches in January is sort of horrifying'').
 Each member of her family was allowed one luxury item that came from far away. Her husband chose coffee, her children hot chocolate and dried fruit. Spices were Ms. Kingsolver's indulgence.
 ''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle'' gives no sense of privation or even boredom. Ms. Kingsolver spent a fair amount of time putting foods by when they were in season so that the larder was stocked. 
 But most readers would have trouble following her program, which included raising much of what the family ate on their farm, including chickens and turkeys. 
 ''We undertook this project because it brings together so many compelling issues of the moment: carbon footprint, global warming, the local economy, the nutritional crisis and community,'' said Ms. Kingsolver. ''Community is very important to me and every book I've ever written is on this subject: what is the debt of the individual to the community?''
 ''We wanted to see if we could show that it's possible and even a lot of fun, not just an experiment in sacrifice,'' she said. ''It was so much more fun than we expected it to be.''
 Most locavores are not strict constructionists. They tend to make exceptions for coffee, pasta, spices, salt and flour. 
 While West Coast residents can use olive oil, Ms. McDermott had to substitute sunflower oil made in Vermont, which has obvious drawbacks. ''It definitely tastes like sunflower seeds,'' she said, ''but another alternative is to make ghee from local butter.'' Wheatberries take the place of rice, and ground cherries or gooseberries, she said, ''can kind of pass for raisins.'' A birthday cake of mashed parsnips was sweetened with maple syrup and maple sugar.
 Ms. McDermott, who designs Web-based training for manufacturing companies with her husband, Ray, started one of the several localvore groups in Vermont last year in the Mad River Valley. During their first event in September, 150 participants took the pledge to eat locally for a week. Only slightly fewer tried it again this January, and more events are planned this year. 
 ''The two biggest barriers to eating local are time and cost,'' she said. ''A lot of people think this is somewhat elitist because if you buy a local chicken it is $3.50 to $4 a pound and you can get them for a lot less in the supermarket. If you want boneless chicken breasts you'll go broke, but if you buy a whole chicken it's affordable because you will use it all. The same thing with lesser cuts of meat. You do need time and a desire to cook something.
 ''And you need a freezer, something like a root cellar. Last year I got into making kimchi and sauerkraut as a way of preserving of food.''
 By far the most pragmatic of these locavores is Ms. Prentice. ''To restrict yourself to eating locally is an interesting exercise,'' she said. ''It's consciousness raising to see what you'd be living on, but I don't think of it as a necessary or practical solution of our globalized food system. I am not opposed to any importation, but what we can grow locally we should grow locally. 
 ''We have a situation in California where we export as many strawberries as we import. It's gotten ridiculous.''
 People who have tried to eat a strictly local diet, even those like Ms. Abel who are dabblers, say it has been a life-changing experience. ''One of the things about having this party is becoming aware of how far things have come,'' she said. ''So now we are eating differently. Having a dish of eggplant, tomatoes and zucchini in February is weird to me. We are eating a lot of kale and root vegetables in winter and buying a lot of stuff at the Greenmarket year round. It's not a life philosophy but it's not a game.''
 Though eating locally can be a difficult feat, in many parts of the country it is easier than it was five years ago. Farming land continues to disappear as larger farms go under, but the number of small farms that cater to their neighbors has increased 20 percent, to 1.9 million in the last six years. The number of farmers' markets and farm stands, food co-ops and community-supported agriculture groups is growing. In his new book ''Deep Economy,'' (Times Books) Bill McKibben writes that the number of farmers' markets has increased from 340 in 1970 to 3,700 in 2004. 
 New Seasons, an eight-store supermarket chain in Portland, Ore., has made its name as a place where local food is king. Byerly's and Lunds in Minneapolis also feature local products. 
 Schools are catching on to the idea. In 2002 400 school districts in 22 states had farm-to-cafeteria programs that provided students locally grown food. Today 1,035 districts in 35 states participate.
 But before locavores take too much credit for the phenomenon, there are a bunch of back-to-the-landers in Vermont who ate local foods 30 years ago. ''There are a lot of people here who call themselves yokelvores,'' Ms. McDermott said. ''They get their food from within 100 feet of their homes -- homesteaders who have their own cows, chickens and grow their own vegetables. They consider people like us as Johnny-come-latelies.''

HEADLINE: With ABN Amro, Barclays Sees Asia Growth Atoning for Cuts Elsewhere

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Anand Giridharadas contributed reporting from Mumbai and Julia Werdigier from London.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, April 24 

 BODY:
Job cuts in Europe and the United States may be offset by growth in Asia if Barclays and ABN Amro complete their nearly $91 billion deal. 
 The two banks plan to expand in Asia while moving or eliminating more than 23,000 jobs -- many in Europe and the United States -- and selling the LaSalle Bank, based in Chicago, to Bank of America. About half of those 23,000 jobs will be relocated, thousands of them to India.
Asia is the ''most important area of growth,'' for Barclays' investment bank, Robert E. Diamond Jr., the president of Barclays, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. 
 The combination would create ''one of the premier foreign banks in Asia,'' a fit that was a major reason for the deal, Mr. Diamond said. 
 Barclays' chief executive, John S. Varley, was exuberant about the opportunities in Asia when he announced the deal in London on Monday. ''ABN has much better exposure in Asia than Barclays,'' he told members of the news media.
 Barclays' plans mirror those of multinational corporations like General Motors and Citigroup, which have been increasing investments and staffing in Asia while making spending cuts in Europe and the United States. Wall Street investment banks, in particular, have headed aggressively into India and into smaller Asian markets like Vietnam while bolstering their operations in China, where they have been lured by strong economic growth. 
 ABN Amro's history in Asia dates back nearly 200 years to the time of Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia. The bank focuses on organic growth, has a string of retail branches and long relationships with thousands of corporate clients. Meanwhile, Barclays has been expanding its Asian trading operations, luring employees from Wall Street peers for its bond, equity and loan trading desks.
 ABN Amro and Barclays have complementary assets in China. Barclays' strategy has been to build its investment bank and fund management business. ABN Amro has five branches in China and recently was allowed to incorporate there, which will allow it to conduct local currency business. 
 In India, Mr. Diamond predicts, ''there will be no question'' about being the premier foreign bank. In recent weeks, Barclays has plastered advertisements across billboards in Mumbai, emphasizing the bank's long global history. Barclays has been increasing its investment banking activities in India in the last year, and Mr. Diamond is planning a trip there in May. 
 Bankers and analysts in Asia said that a Barclays and ABN Amro combination could become a formidable competitor in some markets. Still, many suggested that if the banks were really serious about their Asian presence, they might try another takeover down the road. 
 ''The thing that's lacking in their strategy is the acquisition of a bank with a presence in India and China,'' said Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC, one of India's largest banks. 
 Like many foreign banks, ABN Amro has made some missteps in Asia and has battled with local governments. In 2004, the bank sold its majority stake in the Bank of Asia, based in Thailand, for 442 million euros ($600 million). Last year, it paid $4.5 million to a state-owned Vietnamese bank after a trading dispute. 
 ABN Amro's biggest rivals, like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, have been ramping up in Asia for years.
 A Barclays-ABN Amro bank would have ''some formidable competition,'' said Lynn Exton, senior vice president at Moody's Investor Service in London. ''It's a huge region, margins are under pressure and I'm not sure they have the depth of relationships that are necessary'' to succeed in Asia. 
 ''It is going to require some serious investment in terms of management resources and focus,'' she said. 
 In 2006, ABN Amro's operating income in Asia increased 22.8 percent, to 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion), or just 6.6 percent of the bank's total operating income of 22.7 billion euros ($31 billion). Barclays does not break out its Asian operations, but it did mention that they were important to the company's profit growth in 2006. 
 Mr. Diamond has predicted in the past that Barclays Capital will increase its business in Asia by 20 percent to 30 percent a year. On Tuesday, he said that together the two banks could have the same growth rate, ''but from a higher profit base.''

HEADLINE: Port Authority Is Reviving Plans for Tower Atop Bus Station

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is resurrecting plans to build a skyscraper over the north wing of the bus terminal on Eighth Avenue between 42nd and 41st Streets. 
 The authority plans to enter into exclusive negotiations for the next six months with the developers -- Lawrence Ruben Company and Vornado Realty Trust -- to build a 1.39-million-square-foot, glass-and-steel tower. If a deal cannot be struck, the Port Authority will allow other developers to bid. The authority's board is expected to approve the plan today.
The new agreement revives an eight-year-old project and brings an end to litigation between the authority and the two developers. After a competition in 1999, the Port Authority selected Vornado and the Lawrence Ruben Company to build a $500 million office tower with large electronic signs.
 The developers agreed to pay more than $110 million for the development rights and to renovate the terminal's north wing. But the project fell by the wayside in 2001 after the dot-com collapse and a decline in the economy. Shortly after, Vornado sued the authority in an attempt to retain control of the project.
 Late last year, Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado, approached the authority's chairman, Anthony R. Coscia, about settling the litigation and restarting the project.

HEADLINE: Auto Rivalries Make Madison Avenue a Frantic Street

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE frenetic competition in the automotive industry is taking its toll on the advertising industry.
 In the last six months, the makers of six auto brands decided to re-evaluate the relationships with the agencies that worked for them. Five placed accounts in review, while the sixth changed agencies without any formal reassessment.
Together, the brands -- Audi, Hyundai, Jeep, Porsche, Saturn and Volvo -- account for $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion in ad spending each year. In 2006, domestic and foreign automakers spent $16.3 billion to advertise in major media, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending. 
 Those huge outlays put auto marketers first among all those tracked by TNS; by comparison, the next largest category, telecommunications, accounted for $9.4 billion in ad spending last year.
 ''It's not only the biggest category, but also the most visible and prestigious,'' said Fran Kelly, chief executive at Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas.
 ''Almost everybody is interested in cars,'' said Mr. Kelly, who got back into the category on Monday when Volvo, part of Ford Motor, chose Arnold and the London office of Nitro as its new worldwide creative team. The two agencies will oversee work with spending estimated at $150 million to $200 million a year.
 Even so, to paraphrase the familiar expression from ''Spider-Man,'' with great assignments come great responsibilities.
 ''Every one of us is looking for an edge, looking to tell our client's story in a better way, because every automotive client is under pressure to deliver,'' Mr. Kelly said.
 Mr. Kelly and his agency are all too familiar with those pressures. In 2005, after a decade of creating campaigns for Volkswagen of America, Arnold lost the account, without a review, to Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami, part of MDC Partners.
 The primary reason for the restlessness among auto marketers is the intensifying competition in the selling of cars, sport utilities, minivans and other vehicles.
 If anyone needed another reminder of the relentless rivalries, one came yesterday when data showed that Toyota Motor had passed General Motors in worldwide sales for the first three months of the year. It was the first time that G.M. had fallen behind Toyota in a quarterly global sales tally.
 Every so often, auto account changes come in bursts, like the current one. For example, from February 1991 to March 1993, the relationships of 14 auto brands and their agencies were re-examined, and only one incumbent agency survived a review.
 That exception was Leo Burnett, whose relationship with Oldsmobile was later severed anyway when General Motors phased out the brand in 2004.
 This time, of the five auto assignments placed in review, four have been decided and assignments have changed hands in each case. (Porsche Cars North America is still reviewing its creative and media accounts.)
 ''You always want to see the possibilities of what can be,'' said Scott Keogh, chief marketing officer at Audi of America in Auburn Hills, Mich., part of Volkswagen. In December, Audi shifted its creative account, with spending estimated at $100 million a year, to Venables Bell & Partners in San Francisco from McKinney & Silver in Durham, N.C., a Havas agency that had produced Audi campaigns since 1993.
 ''We saw a brand that will have significant new products in the market place, a brand ready for takeoff here in America,'' Mr. Keogh said of Audi, adding: ''We just had a record sales year in 2006, breaking over 90,000. But we think absolutely there's more opportunity to grow even more.''
 Mr. Keogh acknowledged the risk of leaving an agency that created Audi's ads for so long and helped sales increase to 90,116 last year, from 77,917 in 2004.
 ''From our point of view, we saw the upside,'' Mr. Keogh said, ''and the upside outweighed the risk.'' The first work from Venables Bell for Audi is due soon.
 Another review that ended with a decision to change agencies involved Hyundai Motor America, part of Hyundai Motor of South Korea, which spends about $600 million a year on ads in major media. Last week, Hyundai left the Richards Group in Dallas for Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group.
 ''We do not have a product problem,'' said Joel Ewanick, vice president for marketing at Hyundai Motor America in Fountain Valley, Calif. ''We have a brand problem.''
 ''And Goodby gave us an idea that could really take the brand to the next level,'' he added. Mr. Ewanick declined to reveal details of the new approach until the work from Goodby, Silverstein begins to run.
 Mr. Ewanick described a change in consumer habits that is contributing to the turnover in auto accounts.
 ''Last year, over 80 percent of people who bought cars in America said they did some kind of online research,'' he said, adding that while Hyundai ''jumped in early'' into Internet marketing, ''we kind of reached a plateau and stayed where we were, frankly not using it to its full potential.''
 So an important element of the creative review involved seeking an agency with digital expertise. Goodby, Silverstein is among agencies steeped in traditional forms of marketing that are striving to bolster their abilities to handle tasks like search marketing, mobile marketing and online advertising.
 Goodby, Silverstein is also an example of how the traffic in auto accounts can sometimes resemble the congestion on a California freeway.
 Goodby, Silverstein was the creative agency for the Saturn division of General Motors until late January, when the assignment left without a review for the Los Angeles office of Deutsch, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 After losing Saturn, Goodby, Silverstein joined the review for the Volvo creative assignment, teaming up with 180, an agency that is majority-owned by Omnicom.
 But when Hyundai started its creative review, Goodby, Silverstein decided to withdraw from pursuing Volvo to go after the South Korean brand -- a smart move, in retrospect.

HEADLINE: Turning the Election Green

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
O.K. class, it's time for another news quiz. I'll give you the question and you tell me who asked it and why it was significant. Ready? Here goes: 
 ''Mr. President, how would you rate yourself as an environmentalist? What specifically has your administration done to improve the condition of our nation's air and water supply?'' You'll never get it. The questioner was James Hubb, a member of the audience at the second presidential debate between George W. Bush and John Kerry at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 8, 2004.
What's the significance? It was the only question about energy or environmental policy that was posed in any of the three presidential debates in 2004. Hard to believe when you consider the salience of these issues today. Is it any wonder we still don't have a serious energy policy? 
 We can't afford to make this mistake again. In this election cycle, we need to hold a ''Green Debate,'' devoted only to energy and environmental questions. I would suggest Tulane University in New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2007 -- the second anniversary of Katrina. That would give the candidates, Republicans and Democrats, all summer to develop positions and it would give the voters all fall to examine them before the big primaries in February 2008.
 I would like to see each party's candidates questioned separately, so Republican voters and Democrats can each focus on their primary candidates. The questioning should be done by a three-person panel consisting of one climate scientist, one energy investor and one college student, since young people will be the ones most affected by global warming.
 We can't let ethanol-promoting farmers in Iowa determine our energy policy anymore by virtue of the early Iowa primary. For too long, all we've had in this country is energy politics, not energy policy, and that is why we have this incoherent mess of energy systems, standards and fuels. 
 ''A new conversation has started in the country -- a new energy economy is what the people want,'' said Carl Pope, director of the Sierra Club. To get there, though, we need to force politicians to start thinking about going ''green'' as part of our national security strategy, as a Plan B for disengaging from Iraq and still driving reform in the Middle East, as an economic opportunity, as a way to restore U.S. leadership, and as an answer for climate change.
 Since addressing all these issues will require a carbon tax, or a really serious cap-and-trade system, or tighter mileage and efficiency standards -- i.e., sacrifice -- we need our candidates to be talking about such things in the campaign so they have a mandate to act if elected.
 A group of environmental entrepreneurs, including Andrew Shapiro of GreenOrder and Jesse Fink of Marshall Street Management, just created a Web site, GreenPrimary.org, to host online forums where, after the Green Debate, voters can study the different candidates' policy positions and even vote for the one they think is most serious. ''The 2008 presidential campaign will present the first opportunity for a national candidate to make sustainability a breakthrough electoral issue,'' Mr. Shapiro argues.
 A new survey released last week by the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, conducted for the Center for American Progress, underscores that large majorities of independents (59 percent) and Democrats (76 percent) support action now to stop global warming and make the U.S. energy-independent, along with a significant bloc of Republicans (41 percent). 
 ''Only 27 percent of people feel that our energy policy is headed in the right direction, while 65 percent say our energy policy is seriously off on the wrong track,'' the Greenberg firm said. ''Moreover, a majority of Americans (52 percent) believes the U.S. is either falling or has fallen far behind other countries in developing clean, alternative energy. Only 14 percent of people believe we lead the world in developing these technologies.''
 They're right. The biggest energy deficit we have right now in America is the energy to lead on this issue -- to overcome all the entrenched interests that have tied us in knots and have left our country with what the energy expert Gal Luft calls ''the sum of all lobbies'' instead of the sum of the best energy practices.
 The best way to overcome that is to elevate the issue during the campaign to a level that forces everyone to put a serious energy/environment platform on the table and builds a real mandate for the next president.
 Correction from my last column: H.I.V.-AIDS kills more people in Africa than malaria.

HEADLINE: OSHA Leaves Worker Safety Largely in Hands of Industry

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Ron Nixon contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24 

 BODY:
Seven years ago, a Missouri doctor discovered a troubling pattern at a microwave popcorn plant in the town of Jasper. After an additive was modified to produce a more buttery taste, nine workers came down with a rare, life-threatening disease that was ravaging their lungs.
 Puzzled Missouri health authorities turned to two federal agencies in Washington. Scientists at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which investigates the causes of workplace health problems, moved quickly to examine patients, inspect factories and run tests. Within months, they concluded that the workers became ill after exposure to diacetyl, a food-flavoring agent.
But the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, charged with overseeing workplace safety, reacted with far less urgency. It did not step up plant inspections or mandate safety standards for businesses, even as more workers became ill. 
 On Tuesday, the top official at the agency told lawmakers at a Congressional hearing that it would prepare a safety bulletin and plan to inspect a few dozen of the thousands of food plants that use the additive. 
 That response reflects OSHA's practices under the Bush administration, which vowed to limit new rules and roll back what it considered cumbersome regulations that imposed unnecessary costs on businesses and consumers. Across Washington, political appointees -- often former officials of the industries they now oversee -- have eased regulations or weakened enforcement of rules on issues like driving hours for truckers, logging in forests and corporate mergers.
 Since George W. Bush became president, OSHA has issued the fewest significant standards in its history, public health experts say. It has imposed only one major safety rule. The only significant health standard it issued was ordered by a federal court.
 The agency has killed dozens of existing and proposed regulations and delayed adopting others. For example, OSHA has repeatedly identified silica dust, which can cause lung cancer, and construction site noise as health hazards that warrant new safeguards for nearly three million workers, but it has yet to require them.
 ''The people at OSHA have no interest in running a regulatory agency,'' said Dr. David Michaels, an occupational health expert at George Washington University who has written extensively about workplace safety. ''If they ever knew how to issue regulations, they've forgotten. The concern about protecting workers has gone out the window.''
 Agency officials defend their performance, saying that workplace deaths and injuries have declined during their tenure. They have been considering new standards and revising outdated ones that were unduly burdensome on businesses, they said, adding that they have moved cautiously on new rules because those require extensive scientific and economic analysis.
 ''By the time the Bush administration is done -- we have a good record already -- we will have a better record,'' said Edwin G. Foulke Jr., the agency's head, in a recent interview.
 On diacetyl, Mr. Foulke said ''the science is murky'' on whether the additive causes bronchiolitis obliterans, the disease that has been called ''popcorn worker's lung.'' That claim is echoed by some industry officials, but a number of leading scientists and doctors agree with scientists at the national occupational safety institute that there is strong evidence linking the additive to the illness.
 Without an OSHA standard, which would establish the permissible level of exposure for workers, companies can set any limit of exposure they want.
 Instead of regulations, Mr. Foulke and top officials at other agencies favor a ''voluntary compliance strategy,'' reaching agreements with industry associations and companies to police themselves. 
 Administration officials say such programs are less costly, allowing companies to hire more workers and keep consumer prices down. The number of voluntary agreements has grown in recent years, but they cover a fraction of the seven million work sites that OSHA oversees, or less than 1 percent of the work force. Sixty-one food plants out of the tens of thousands across the country participate; industry representatives say other businesses are taking steps to protect workers on their own. 
 Critics say the voluntary programs tend to have little focus on specific hazards and no enforcement power. Because only companies with strong safety records are eligible, they argue, the programs do not force less-conscientious businesses to improve their workplaces. A 2004 study by the Government Accountability Office found some promising results from such programs, but recommended against expanding them until their effectiveness could be assessed.
 ''OSHA has been focusing on the best companies in their voluntary protection program while doing nothing in the area of standard setting,'' said Peg Seminario, the director of occupational safety and health at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''They've simply gotten out of the standard-setting business in favor of industry partnerships that have no teeth.'' 
 While labor organizations and public health experts argue that the agency has been lax in recent years, some industries have applauded its efforts. Construction companies, for example, are pleased that OSHA recently decided to relax the standards for handling explosives.
 The agency had long been the target of businesses that criticized its rules as arbitrary, costly and confusing. Three of the biggest industries regulated by OSHA -- transportation, agribusiness and construction -- have given more than $630 million in political campaign contributions since 2000, with nearly three-quarters of that money going to Republicans. The Bush administration has promised to address their concerns. Change at OSHA 
 ''We're also going to bring a transparency to the regulatory jungle that is unprecedented in the federal government,'' Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao told business owners in a speech on June 2002. ''There are more words in the Federal Register describing OSHA regulations than there are words in the Bible. They're a lot less inspired to read and a lot harder to understand. This is not fair.''
 Until recently, Congress has provided no significant oversight of OSHA. With Democrats now back in control, House and Senate committees are holding hearings this week. 
 Among those who testified Tuesday was Eric Peoples, a former worker at the popcorn plant in Jasper, a small town 125 miles south of Kansas City. Once healthy, the 35-year-old Mr. Peoples has been told by doctors that he will need a double-lung transplant. Far from Washington, he finds the debate over the calculus of regulation -- the costs to companies and consumers of upgrading workplaces versus the possible health benefits to workers -- baffling. 
 ''I can't understand what it would take to get them to pass rules to make it safer to handle this stuff,'' Mr. Peoples said, referring to diacetyl. ''Something needs to be done.''
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration was created under President Richard M. Nixon in 1970 after Congressional hearings exposed dangerous workplace conditions. The agency was to set and enforce safety standards as well as detect health hazards before they could take a toll on workers. Since the agency's creation, deaths and injuries on the job have steadily declined. Regulators have taken credit for much of that trend, though experts also cite pressure from insurers and lawsuits. Government records show that in 2005, more than 6,800 workplace-related deaths occurred, along with 4.2 million injuries and illnesses. OSHA officials say that since 2001, the fatality rate has declined by 7 percent and the injury rate by 19 percent.
 Labor leaders and health experts say those numbers significantly undercount the problem, in part because the Bush administration has reduced the categories of recognized injuries and because many dangerous jobs are now performed by undocumented workers who do not report problems. 
 In one of his first acts in office, President Bush signed legislation repealing one of OSHA's most-debated accomplishments during the Clinton administration, an ergonomics standard intended to reduce injuries to factory, construction and office workers from repetitive motions and lifting. Business groups and manufacturers had lobbied against the measure, saying it would cost $100 billion to carry out.
 By the end of 2001, OSHA had withdrawn more than a dozen proposed regulations. The agency, though, soon identified several safety priorities: rules on the hazards posed by dust from silica, used as a blasting agent, and noise from construction sites, which was causing a growing number of workers to suffer hearing loss. The agency has yet to produce either standard, though OSHA officials say they are working on them. 
 Mr. Foulke, the OSHA chief, has a history of opposing regulations produced by the agency he now leads. He has described himself as a ''true Ronald Reagan Republican'' who ''firmly believes in limited government.'' Before coming to Washington last year, Mr. Foulke, a former Republican Party state chairman in South Carolina and top political fund-raiser, worked in Greenville, S.C., for a law firm that advises companies on how to avoid union organizing. Representing the United States Chamber of Commerce, he had testified before Congress several times to promote voluntary OSHA compliance programs. He also opposed the ergonomics standards. 
 And as a member in the 1990s of an independent agency that reviews OSHA citations, he led a successful effort to weaken the agency's enforcement authority.
 Early in his tenure at OSHA, Mr. Foulke delivered a speech called ''Adults Do the Darndest Things,'' which attributed many injuries to worker carelessness. Large posters of workers' making dangerous errors, like erecting a tall ladder close to an overhead wire, were displayed around him.
 ''Kids don't always know what their parents do all day at work, but they instinctively understand the importance of them working safely,'' he told the audience, which included children who had won a safety-poster contest. ''In contrast, adults could stand to learn a thing or two. Looking at the posters, I was reminded of a couple examples of safety and health bloopers that are both humorous and horrible.'' A Pattern of Illness 
 Soon after Eric Peoples began working at the Jasper popcorn plant in 1997, he was thrilled to get a promotion: from the assembly line, which paid $6 to $7 an hour, to the mixing room, where he got more than $11 an hour to prepare ingredients.
 Ten months later, Mr. Peoples recalled in a recent interview, he came down with a fever and chills. Doctors first said that Mr. Peoples, then 27, had pneumonia. When he did not improve, he saw a specialist who treated him for asthma. Still suffering from breathing problems, Mr. Peoples was hospitalized in St. Louis. After days of testing, doctors diagnosed bronchiolitis obliterans.
 ''My lung capacity had dropped to 18 percent,'' Mr. Peoples said. He was told that there was no cure for the often-fatal disease and that he would likely need a double lung transplant to survive.
 Some of his co-workers had similar health problems. A local lawyer whose mother had fallen ill showed the medical records of several workers to Dr. Allen Parmet, a former T.W.A. medical director who specializes in occupational hazards.
 ''It took me about 15 or 20 minutes to see there was a pattern,'' said Dr. Parmet, who in his previous two decades in medicine had seen only three other cases of bronchiolitis obliterans. He contacted the Missouri Department of Health, which then notified the agencies in Washington.
 The Missouri officials noted that in addition to nine sick workers identified by Dr. Parmet, 20 to 30 current and retired workers had similar symptoms. All had been exposed to vapors from diacetyl, a compound found naturally in cheese, butter, milk and other foods. It is added for the buttery taste in microwave popcorn and widely used as a flavoring agent in other foods, like snacks and pastries.
 Although Dr. Parmet's letter was the first that Washington learned of a possible problem with diacetyl, some companies had been aware of the health hazards. In late 1996, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association heard from a company that a flavoring plant employee had developed bronchiolitis obliterans. Three years earlier, BASF, the German chemical maker, had found in animal studies that diacetyl caused severe respiratory problems. 
 After scientists from the national occupational safety institute visited the Jasper factory and examined the injured workers, the agency issued a bulletin in September 2001 saying ''a work-related cause of lung disease'' had occurred there. In December 2003, the agency issued an alert to more than 4,000 businesses, with tens of thousands of workers, that suggested safeguards.
 OSHA's response was more limited. The agency sent an inspector to the Jasper plant, but he did not test the air, saying the company's insurers had done an environmental sampling four years earlier. He concluded that the plant was in compliance with existing rules and closed the case. 
 Sixteen months later, a lawyer for ill workers filed a complaint with the agency. OSHA conducted a 40-minute inspection, but said it could do nothing more because there was no safety standard that established what level of diacetyl was acceptable. Since the first outbreak, OSHA has inspected three food and flavoring plants for links to popcorn worker's lung, and issued one citation, according to records provided to public health experts at George Washington University and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union under the Freedom of Information Act.
 Other workers have developed symptoms of the lung disease. Keith Campbell had worked at a Conagra microwave popcorn factory in Marion, Ohio, for two years when he got sick. He was then 44, but his doctors told him he had the lung capacity of an 80-year-old, Mr. Campbell said in an interview. He has extreme difficulty breathing, particularly in cold weather. ''It's affected my entire life,'' he said.
 Kenneth B. McClain, a lawyer at the Missouri firm that has represented Mr. Peoples and Mr. Campbell, said he had tried or settled more than 100 cases involving diacetyl and other flavorings and that more than 500 were still awaiting resolution in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri and Ohio. 
 At a two-week trial in March 2004, lawyers for the makers of diacetyl products -- International Flavors and Fragrances and its subsidiary, Bush Boake Allen -- maintained that the additive did not cause Mr. Peoples's illness and that, in any event, the popcorn company had mishandled the substance. Jurors awarded Mr. Peoples $20 million. His case, like Mr. Campbell's, was later settled for an undisclosed amount. 
 Melissa I. Sachs, a spokeswoman at International Flavors and Fragrances, based in New York, declined to comment on the cases. According to its latest annual report, the company has been sued by more than 150 workers in four states. 
 Health experts have not raised alarms about diacetyl vapors that are released when consumers make microwave popcorn. But they note that there is little science on the issue, and the Environmental Protection Agency has declined to make public the results of its studies.
 There are no estimates of the costs of upgrading all plants that use the food additive to protect workers better. Some microwave popcorn companies, including the Gilster-Mary Lee Corporation plant in Jasper, have spent millions of dollars on better ventilation, respirators and other equipment. The Official Response 
 Two industry groups -- the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association and the Popcorn Board -- have also become involved in resolving workplace problems, particularly as the lawsuits have mounted. The association has not expressed opposition to an OSHA standard; its officials say it is working with California regulators to develop one there. 
 But John Hallagan, the association's general counsel, says the group is working with OSHA to reach a voluntary compliance agreement.
 ''OSHA is doing the right things in addressing flavor-related health and safety issues,'' Mr. Hallagan said in a recent e-mail message.
 He said the agency had met with industry and health officials and had posted on a Web site possible health hazards associated with some flavorings.
 In September 2002, OSHA's Kansas City office entered into an alliance with the Popcorn Board, which represents popcorn processors, to try to address safety problems. But that arrangement soon ended.
 Last July, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters petitioned OSHA for an emergency temporary standard for diacetyl. Urging action, 42 doctors and scientists from institutions including Harvard, Yale, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins, wrote to Ms. Chao, who oversees OSHA. 
 The agency responded by saying it was preparing a safety bulletin and would be monitoring diacetyl hazards at a few dozen popcorn plants, but not at the thousands of other food factories that use the additive. That has frustrated public health experts like Dr. Michaels, the George Washington University epidemiologist. 
 ''Here you have one federal agency, Niosh, doing a great job exploring the science behind a problem and a second agency, OSHA, which is supposed to be moving forward with enforcement and standard setting, and they are not,'' he said. Loosening the Rules

HEADLINE: In Mexican Town, Maybe a Way to Reduce Poverty in New York

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA; Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 24 

 BODY:
For a few days every other month, the narrow sidewalks of Tepoztlan, a scenic mountain town south of here, fill with hundreds of women from surrounding villages, many tugging along children by the hand or carrying infants slung at their waists in rebozos.
 They come in by bus or foot and gather in the cool shadows of the municipal auditorium, where government workers sit at tables on the stage, ready to hand out cash.
 The women are participants in an antipoverty program that is a model for one that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to start in New York City. The mayor traveled to Mexico on Tuesday, joining City Hall officials who arrived two days earlier for a fact-finding trip. 
 On Monday in Tepoztlan (pronounced teh-pos-LAHN), they watched as about 800 women waited for three hours or more in the auditorium to go up to get their money. If the women and their children have kept all their medical appointments, and if their children have stayed in school, the money is theirs to use as they wish. The awards range from 360 to 3,710 pesos (about $36 to $370), enough to buy food or shoes or other necessities. The size of the award depends on how many children they have and what level of school the children are in. 
 The program is 10 years old, has a budget of more than $3 billion a year and covers almost a quarter of all Mexicans. 
 It may seem strange that one of the world's financial capitals should look to a small mountain town for answers to its own urban ills. But since this program got its start in rural Mexico in 1997, it has been heralded by the World Bank and others as a powerful model for fighting chronic poverty.
 Outside evaluations have found that the program, called Oportunidades, has been successful in raising school attendance and nutrition levels. The percentage of Mexicans living in extreme poverty has fallen by 17 percentage points since 1996, when it reached 37 percent.
 Those results have spurred some 30 countries to adopt some version of the program.
 Before Mr. Bloomberg's arrival here, his deputy mayor for human services, Linda I. Gibbs, and her staff interviewed local doctors, school officials and scholars who have studied the program since its inception. 
 But will something that works for the impoverished of Mexico help the poor of New York? 
 ''Clearly the economies of the Mexico and the U.S. and New York City are very different,'' Ms. Gibbs said as she toured the village's medical clinic, where many Oportunidades recipients go for their regular checkups and medical care. 
 ''But what the poor have in common is that they are really struggling to make ends meet, that every day every decision is, 'Do I do this thing or do I do that thing?' It's not a matter of can I go to work and get health care; it's often a matter of trading it off.''
 The program pays cash stipends mostly to mothers -- about 97 percent of recipients are women -- on the assumption that they will be more likely to spend the money on their children. To qualify, people must be in extreme poverty, roughly defined by officials here as living on less than the equivalent of $2 a day.
 The payments are tied to changes in behavior intended to lift families out of poverty. So the program requires families to keep their children in school and take them for regular checkups. Parents must also attend talks on health, nutrition and family planning.
 In addition, pregnant women, infants and breast-feeding mothers receive an iron-fortified supplement to ward off malnutrition.
 They also receive small grants to offset the cost of school uniforms and supplies, but many of the women in Tepoztlan said the school grants are not enough to cover the extra costs. 
 And there are hardships in staying qualified. Getting time off work to get medical checkups can be difficult. And making the trek every two months to receive their cash typically consumes the whole day. Many of the women, when they can find jobs, work as cleaning women or in the cornfields with their husbands.
 Luisa Rosa, a participant who is a 35-year-old mother of four, also volunteers to help organize others in the program in her village, Huachinantitla, about a 20-minute walk from Tepoztlan, to ensure they keep up with the requirements.
 ''The truth is, it is difficult,'' Ms. Rosa said. ''Because sometimes they don't get permission to get off work, so they don't go for their medical appointments.''
 Some in her village have received notices that they are no longer eligible, she says, but that has been rare.
 One woman, Sylvia Hernandez-Zavaleta, 47, said the program saved her life. Four years ago, doctors discovered she had pancreatic cancer during one of her required visits to the medical clinic, making early intervention possible. 
 ''And while I was hospitalized,'' she added, ''I did not have any other income but money from Oportunidades.''
 And as for the time-consuming gatherings, academics have also found value in that. In addition to chatting and gossiping, the women also encourage one another.
 ''They become social gatherings and help shift norms,'' said J. Lawrence Aber, a professor of applied psychology and public policy at New York University, who was part of the mayor's poverty commission that pushed for New York to adopt the program. ''It's a form of social capital.''
 Still, there are questions about how much more effective the program can be in lifting large numbers of people permanently out of poverty. The quality of the services they get -- particularly education -- is poor.
 ''While they're spending a lot more time in schools, the impact on learning is mixed,'' said Susan W. Parker, an economist in Mexico City, who has studied the program since its inception under the name Progresa.
 And then there is the question of whether they can find a decent job locally, or whether they will feel forced to migrate to the United States.
 That issue bothers the program's principal architect, Santiago Levy, a former undersecretary of finance. At an interview at his home in Mexico City, he said, ''Progresa is a program to improve human capital; it is not a jobs-creation program.''
 Oportunidades will never cure poverty in Mexico without major reforms to the country's labor market, Mr. Levy said. Still, he credits the program as one of two major reasons poverty has declined, the other being money sent home from Mexican workers in the north.
 ''When I first proposed this to the cabinet, I was murdered by some of the ministers,'' he recalled. ''The standard arguments were the husband's going to beat the wife, take the money and go and drink, or they're going to buy cigarettes, or people are going to be lazy.''
 That has not happened, Mr. Levy said.
 ''The evidence shows that 99 percent of the time they buy shoes for the children, roof for the housing, food, or they save,'' he said.
 For it to work in New York, Mr. Levy says, the city will have to ensure that it can survive changes in political administrations, as it has in Mexico. Another important component of success for the Mexico program was to keep it free of the political opportunism and patronage that has plagued past antipoverty programs, which with a few exceptions they have largely done, he said.
 Under the New York plan, which is still being developed, poor families would be paid up to $5,000 a year to meet goals like attending parent-teacher conferences, getting regular medical checkups and holding down a full-time job. Participants would get their money through automatic deposits, not by attending a large gathering. 
 A pilot program is scheduled to begin in September with 2,500 randomly selected families whose progress will be measured against 2,500 families who will not receive the benefits. The pilot program will be privately financed. The city has already raised $42 million of the $50 million needed to cover the initial costs. If it is successful, Mr. Bloomberg hopes that public money will eventually go into it.
 But there is still a question of how a rural program will translate into an urban setting. Mexico began expanding the program into smaller cities only in 2001, and into larger metropolitan areas in 2004. Mexico City was one of the last areas in the country to get the program. In 2006, only about 18,300 residents there were receiving benefits, according to the program's statistics.
 The mayor of Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard, has been a strong critic of the program, saying that it is too conservative and that at the pace with which it is expanding, it would take two generations to help his city's worst off.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bloomberg and his staff viewed the program in the larger setting of Toluca, an industrial city of about 750,000 about 45 minutes west of Mexico City, where the women gather in a courtyard outside a bank for their money. Later, he met with President Felipe Calderon, though it is unclear if they discussed the program. 
 While Toluca is a big city, the mayor's delegation did not view the program as it operates in a major metropolitan area like Mexico City, to the frustration of some in his delegation. Ms. Gibbs, the deputy mayor, said this was mainly because the programs are not as developed in the nation's largest cities, and because of scheduling considerations. 
 Mexican officials say the dropout rate is higher in cities, and the program is more prone to fraud, because families can more easily hide income and household assets that determine whether they qualify for benefits, which could also be an issue in New York.
 Mayor Bloomberg acknowledged that the program might not work in the five boroughs.
 ''But shame on us if we don't have the courage to try things which, if it doesn't work, you will describe as a failure and I would describe as something we should be proud of that we at least tried to help,'' he said. ''We should not walk away from any idea that can possibly help.''

HEADLINE: A New Bank Woos Those Who Trust Only Cash

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
By yesterday's opening, the building on 21st Street in Long Island City, Queens -- once home to a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet -- seemed distinctly banklike. Four tellers waited at their stations, deposit slips were lined up in neat stacks, and easy-listening music was playing over the sound system. The only thing missing was customers.
 They filtered in to the Amalgamated Bank branch slowly, like explorers. Jacqueline Williams, 48, has never had a bank account; she keeps her money in a tight roll inside a hollowed-out prayerbook. Sylvia Williams, 50, has never had one either: for 27 years, she has taken her paycheck to the same check-cashing business. ''I'll break it to him easy,'' she said, beaming. 
 She said she could not wait to tell her relatives who already use A.T.M. cards that she would soon be opening an account and joining their ranks. ''Now I'm going to have the plastic, too,'' she said. 
 A year and a half ago, when Councilman Eric Gioia and the East River Development Alliance, a group that represents public housing residents, commissioned a survey of people living in the Queensbridge Houses, a public housing project that is home to 15,000 people, they found that more than a third had never used a bank account.
 They began a campaign to bring a bank to Queensbridge residents, who they said live more than a mile from the nearest bank. The effort culminated quietly, on Wednesday, with the opening of the Amalgamated branch, near 36th Avenue. 
 Josh Andre, the soft-spoken branch manager, is a veteran of ''underbanked'' neighborhoods -- he has headed branches in Harlem and Jamaica -- and he did not expect to be mobbed the first day. People who have never used banks are fearful: fearful that the bank will disappear overnight, or freeze their assets, or be robbed. Some just do not trust banks. Mr. Andre's plan is to begin walking the neighborhood's streets and explaining himself.
 ''I just want to create the feeling: This is what banks are for,'' he said. 
 Mr. Gioia, who represents Long Island City and the surrounding neighborhoods, has long worried about his constituents' financial health; at one point, after some of his constituents received checks for the Earned Income Tax Credit, he realized that many of them were planning to store the whole sum -- thousands of dollars in some cases -- in cash.
 People who live in an all cash-economy can damage their credit profiles, foreclosing opportunities to buy homes, he said, so a bank account ''can literally change the trajectory of a family's life.''
 In January 2006, Mr. Gioia and the Rev. Mitchell Taylor, of the East River Development Alliance, led a march of several hundred residents through the neighborhood, chanting: ''We don't need a liquor store! We don't need a check casher! We need a bank!'' 
 Amalgamated offered to open a branch there last June, and the state designated the area a Banking Development District, offering banks that moved there tax incentives, employee training and public-funds deposits. 
 Derrick D. Cephas, Amalgamated's president and chief executive, said he expected it to turn a profit within a year. 
 ''I don't think it's a gamble that we don't understand,'' he said. ''This is what we should be doing.'' 
 In the meantime, Mr. Gioia and other community leaders will act ''almost like a dating service,'' he said, offering courses on banking to fifth graders and holding seminars on homeownership and credit repair for adults. The effort was aided, he said, by the delayed mail delivery of 1,800 Social Security checks to people in Queensbridge Houses last month. When Social Security recipients realize that direct deposit of their checks is more reliable, he said, it will nudge them further toward having bank accounts. 
 ''If this works the way I think it will, I think we have a model here,'' he said.
 Jacqueline Williams, an analyst for a telephone company, said that having a bank account would relieve the panic she feels when she forgets where she stashed her money and the exasperation of hearing another lecture from her boyfriend, who will not let her forget the ''thousands and thousands of dollars'' in fees she has paid to check-cashing businesses. 
 Walking out of the bank yesterday afternoon -- she was the only customer at the time -- she said an employee there had been more than encouraging. 
 ''He was all in there: 'Can I help you do this? Can I help you do that?' '' she said, with a look of mild alarm. She said she had gone in to find out about an account for her son, Tyquan, who is 10, and has saved $130, and expects to open accounts for each of them soon.
 ''He's thrilled about the interest'' he will earn, she said. ''He doesn't believe they're going to give him this money for nothing.''

HEADLINE: Durable-Goods Picture Shows Surprising Strength

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
As the housing market dragged yet again last month, business picked up much of the slack and helped keep the economy on track. 
 Data released yesterday allayed fears that business investment was about to falter, raising expectations that decent economic growth can continue while the pullback in residential real estate runs its course.
Businesses placed more orders last month for heavy-duty items like machinery and electrical equipment, the Commerce Department reported. Coming the same day as lackluster new home sales data and a survey by the Federal Reserve that described growth in most regions of the country as modest, the report helped lift stocks to a record close. 
 The Commerce Department's monthly survey of durable goods spending found that orders rose 3.4 percent in March, to $214.9 billion, a larger figure than Wall Street had expected. 
 Even more notable was a closely watched component of durable goods spending that tracks orders apart from those for military goods and aircraft, known as core capital goods and often viewed as the most useful measure of corporate investment spending plans. It rose 4.7 percent after falling 6.2 percent in January and 2.3 percent in February.
 ''The rebound in core capital goods orders is an extremely welcome development,'' Brian Bethune, an economist with Global Insight, a research firm, wrote in a report. The gain, he added, ''should alleviate fears that business investment was on the cusp of spiraling downwards.'' 
 Over the previous two months, weakening durable goods orders had raised concerns among some analysts that the slowing economy might be on the edge of a downturn. Overall orders plunged 8.8 percent in January and initially showed only a weak gain in February.
 But the Commerce Department said yesterday that February was not as bad as it first calculated, and it revised the figures up 0.6 percentage points to a gain of 2.4 percent.
 The evidence on durable goods, together with healthy profit reports, stoked a broad rally on Wall Street yesterday that propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to close above the 13,000 mark for the first time and brought the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index within striking distance of its all-time record. 
 By comparison, when January's durable goods numbers were released Feb. 27, they helped precipitate the stock market's biggest daily percentage loss since 2003.
 Separately, the Commerce Department released its monthly report on new home sales, which showed gains in sales and prices. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for new homes rose 2.6 percent in March to 858,000, after declines in January and February. The median price of a new home rose 6.4 percent compared with a year earlier, to $254,000.
 The lift that developers experienced in March, however, was tempered by new data showing that sales in December, January and February were weaker than first thought. Initial calculations overcounted the sales rates in those months by 48,000 homes. That left February as the worst month for new home sales since September 1999.
 Given the problems in the subprime mortgage market, where lenders to people with poor credit histories are now tightening loan standards, economists said that the March data might not tell the full story.
 ''It seems very likely that the subprime woes hitting the headlines have hurt consumer confidence, driving the number of contract cancellations higher,'' Dimitry Fleming, an economist with ING Financial Markets, wrote in a research report.
 The new home sales figures do not account for buyers who may have backed out of their contracts. And they only modestly improved the picture offered Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors on sales of previously owned homes; that report found the sharpest monthly drop since 1989 in sales of existing homes, which account for about 80 percent of all homes sold.
 The Fed's beige book report, released yesterday, noted that residential real estate activity throughout the country ''continued to weaken.'' The survey, based on statistical and anecdotal evidence from all 12 Fed district banks, found that the Midwest was the hardest hit, with the Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts reporting the biggest decreases in home building. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, housing permits were down 54 percent in March compared with a year earlier.
 Outside of residential real estate, however, the economy appeared to expand moderately from the end of February to mid-April, the Fed report said. The tone of the report was slightly more upbeat than earlier surveys, referring to growth generally as ''modest or moderate,'' a step up from the ''modest'' but ''some slowing'' noted in the previous beige book.

HEADLINE: Infant Deaths: Shame of a Nation

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''In Turnabout, Infant Deaths Climb in South'' (front page, April 22):
When my colleagues and I started a community health center in the Mississippi Delta in the 1960s, we estimated the actual black infant mortality rate in our area at nearly 60 per thousand live births. 
 The causes were abysmal poverty, wide unemployment, crumbling shacks, outright malnutrition, contaminated water and lack of transportation. 
 We addressed those problems, in addition to providing desperately needed medical care. The infant mortality rate dropped sharply.
 Those causes persist, now worsened by deep cuts in Medicaid and welfare. 
 The consequence of shredding the social safety net is more dead black (and white) babies. No health service can overcome the effects of social policies that devastate the lives of the poor.
 This is not just a health problem; it is a measure of our moral commitment to a fair chance for survival. We should be enraged, and ashamed, that these preventable excess deaths continue, and increase, among us. H. Jack Geiger, M.D. Brooklyn, April 25, 2007 The writer was a founding member and national coordinator of the Medical Committee for Human Rights. To the Editor:
 It is troubling that progress in reducing the black infant mortality rate has stagnated and that the rate is rising in Mississippi. 
 For half a century, the black infant mortality rate has been approximately double the white rate. This disparity is complex and cannot be explained solely by medical or socioeconomic factors.
 We know that the mortality rate of infants of foreign-born black women in this country is significantly lower than for infants of native-born black mothers and that Hispanics, in spite of high poverty and very low education rates, have infant mortality similar to whites. 
 It is likely that this new trend among blacks in areas of the South is related, in some fashion, to chronic emotional stress secondary to persistent poverty, a feeling of hopelessness, racial discrimination and health conditions.
 A comprehensive approach beyond just the medical model is called for. Patrick Dowling, M.D. Los Angeles, April 24, 2007 The writer is a professor and chairman of the department of family medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at U.C.L.A. To the Editor:
 Your article shows what many in the public health community have long known to be true: reductions in public health services and insurance programs, especially on a state or community level, have very real health consequences. Infant mortality is the most sensitive measure of that health impact. 
 Perhaps more important, however, is your portrayal of the strong connection between health and poverty. While aggregate health measures in the United States have greatly improved over the last century, there remain vast regional, racial and economic health inequities, as your article demonstrates. 
 To target these inequities, public policy must adopt a broader perspective that recognizes the importance of the socioeconomic determinants of health. Alexander Hertel-Fernandez Evanston, Ill., April 22, 2007 To the Editor:
 As a medical student at an inner-city hospital, I see poverty all the time, but not the poor black towns in your article. We have pockets worthy of the third world in our midst, and no one has noticed it until now! It's about time that health care is brought back to the forefront of the political ground; no mother should bury a baby just because somewhere along the way, somebody forgot that people like her need help. Farheen Qurashi Mission, Kan., April 22, 2007 To the Editor:
 Everywhere across this country, you will find similar issues associated with the infant mortality: pre- and post-natal care, poverty, access to medical care, health insurance and so on.
 When we conducted our analysis of infant mortality in Tennessee last year, we found that even when we controlled for income, African-American mothers had a higher infant mortality rate than white mothers. Why is this? We need to look at other plausible risk factors like intergenerational stress among African-American populations. Pramod Dwivedi Nashville, April 22, 2007 The writer, an epidemiologist at the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, was formerly with the Tennessee Department of Health. To the Editor:
 Sometimes, people reject help because of the manner in which it's offered. I discovered in the course of a long career as a community mental health worker that it is vitally important to avoid making potential service recipients feel even more inferior than many already feel, albeit mistakenly.
 It is quite easy, sadly, to rush to judgment in the helping professions. When that happens, we can expect that some people we are offering to help will view refusal as the best means of preserving their dignity. Vanessa Whippo Danville, Ill., April 22, 2007

HEADLINE: In Europe, Growing Frenzy For Closing Takeover Deals

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 25 

 BODY:
Most years, the United States handily beats Europe for bragging rights in deal making, based on the total value of mergers and acquisitions.
 But this year, Europe is pulling ahead. The current takeover battle in banking, the biggest in the industry's history, is just the latest sign of the growing deal frenzy on the Continent.
That frenzy is prompting changes in corporate behavior. European companies are scrambling to put themselves in play, or fend off unwanted approaches, much like American companies did in the 1980s. 
 Europe's deal mania reflects a number of trends: more active shareholders, particularly hedge funds; an influx of private equity money; low interest rates; and a wealth of European companies with valuable assets that are ripe for the picking, in some cases because they have been poorly managed.
 ''Shareholder activism and hedge funds are acting as a trigger to doing more restructuring kinds of deals,'' said Alexander Dibelius, the head of Goldman Sachs in Germany. ''In combination with private equity and cheap money, this adds to the perceived increase in deal making."
 It is more than just perception. So far this year, the value of mergers and acquisitions announced in Europe is $656.4 billion, compared with $601.4 billion in the United States, according to Thomson Financial (Europe also led in 1990, 1991 and 2002).
 Europe's new economic buoyancy is also providing a tailwind to dealmakers here. 
 Growth rates in Europe are approaching those in the United States, and Europe may outperform the United States this year if the American economy slows.
 Germany, in particular, is booming, with soaring investor confidence and heavy capital spending. Companies are reporting record profits, as they reap the benefits of years of painful overhauls.
 Having retrenched thoroughly, European companies are emerging with leaner cost structures and loftier ambitions. The German energy giant, Eon, for example, made a 42 billion euro ($57 billion) bid for its Spanish counterpart, Endesa -- a deal that eventually collapsed because of resistance by the Spanish.
 That deal underscores a hurdle to deals in Europe, particularly cross-border ones: protectionism is alive and well.
 Political leaders in France, Italy, and Spain speak unabashedly about keeping national assets from foreign buyers. Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative front-runner for the French presidency, promises to maintain France's tradition of defending ''national champions'' in crucial industries.
 In Germany, the former head of the Social Democratic Party, Franz Muntefering, scored points during the last election by referring to foreign hedge funds and private equity investors as heuschrecken, or locusts, intent on plundering German assets and mistreating workers.
 While European executives are generally more open to cross-border deals than politicians, some play the nationalist card when it suits them, to ward off unwanted suitors.
 Porsche, the German sports car maker, has amassed a more than 30 percent stake in Volkswagen, justifying its action by saying it is trying to fend off a potential takeover by foreign private-equity investors.
 Fears of hostile approaches by financial investors have helped fuel the efforts of DaimlerChrysler to unload its money-losing Chrysler division, according to executives at the company.
 They may have even played a role in the abrupt ouster Wednesday of the chief executive of Siemens, the engineering giant, which has been hit by a corruption scandal. 
 People with ties to Siemens said members of its board were worried that if it did not get past the scandal, the company would be vulnerable to a takeover bid by a private equity firm.
 There is ample evidence that hedge funds and other foreign investors are shaking Europe out of it old habits. 
 ABN Amro's negotiations with Barclays were started in part by pressure from the Children's Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, which owns less than 3 percent of ABN Amro. 
 Three years ago, bankers here said, it would have been inconceivable for a hedge fund to force one of Europe's largest banks to, in effect, put itself in play. 
 But in 2005, the Children's Investment Fund waged a fax and e-mail campaign against the management of Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange, which was seeking to take over the London Stock Exchange. 
 Not only did Deutsche Borse end up having to abandon the bid, but the company's chief executive and its chairman were forced to resign.
 The European Central Bank has done its part to keep business humming. While the bank began tightening credit at the end of 2005, its key rate of 4 percent is still below that of the Federal Reserve. 
 Most economists expect that the bank will move cautiously in raising rates further.

HEADLINE: The Minor Leagues of Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
Branch Rickey is renowned for allowing Jackie Robinson to break baseball's color line in 1947 by signing Robinson to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers. But he was also celebrated for another significant contribution to the game. 
 Mr. Rickey was the architect of baseball's modern farm system, the web of independent minor league teams around the country that serves as the training ground for young players hoping for a shot at the major leagues.
It became a model for Thomas S. Lyons, a professor of entrepreneurship at Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business in New York, and Gregg A. Lichtenstein, a business consultant in Margate, N.J., who were searching for ways to develop entrepreneurial talent. ''We kept coming back to baseball's farm system,'' Professor Lyons said. ''It is one of the best talent-generating systems in the world.''
 The pair had an ambitious goal: to build a system in underserved and overlooked regions of the country for identifying, recruiting and developing entrepreneurs. In so doing, they said, they hoped to revitalize local economies and stimulate business development in areas that needed a jump-start. 
 Their model is likely to seem familiar to baseball fans. The Entrepreneurial League System features clearly defined talent levels -- rookie league, single A, double A and triple A -- along with general managers, coaches and scouts.
 Just as the Yankees scour the bushes for the next Derek Jeter, the league is looking for the next Michael Dell or Bill Gates.
 In two years, the pair formed leagues in West Virginia and central Louisiana with a third league starting this month in western Michigan. Nearly 150 entrepreneurs joined teams with the hopes of honing their skills to make ''the show.'' In this case, the show doesn't necessarily mean the major leagues, but it does serve as incentive for these entrepreneurs to learn as much as possible to steer their businesses successfully.
 Professor Lyons and Mr. Lichtenstein have worked together for more than 15 years developing methods for training entrepreneurs and creating business incubators. Mr. Lichtenstein's consulting firm, Collaborative Strategies, is paid a fee for building the leagues by several foundations, including the Kellogg Foundation, the Rapides Foundation and the Benedum Foundation.
 The entrepreneurs are coached without charge, though the plan is to charge double A and triple A entrepreneurs a monthly fee as the concept gains wider acceptance.
 ''Our goal is to help these entrepreneurs create as profitable and effective a business as they can at the level they are at,'' Mr. Lichtenstein said. ''Some will develop into major leaguers, but some will never make it that high. They'll stop at single A or double A and do quite well at those levels.''
 The Entrepreneurial League works on the theory that a structured group support system is far more effective in helping small businesses get off the ground, the founders say. 
 ''Any system where you have a mutual support safety net is superior to toughing it out on your own,'' said Ian C. MacMillan, professor of entrepreneurship and management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''This is a great idea. The sports metaphor is a powerful organizing principle.''
 Amanda Short, 28, an artist in Kanawha City, W. Va., joined the local Advantage Valley E.L.S. in Charleston last August to prepare for starting her own stained-glass retail business. Like most other rookies, she was driven by her belief that she could make money with her skills. ''I knew I could make stained glass, but I had no idea how to run a business,'' Ms. Short said. 
 Most rookies, it turns out, are clueless about the fundamentals, like creating a business plan, understanding a profit-and-loss statement or finding financing. ''My coach took me from an absolute amateur who knew nothing, to the point where I felt confident that I could do this on my own,'' Ms. Short said. She has already been promoted from rookie league to single A.
 Successful entrepreneurs who had made their fortunes and were eager to give something back to the community were tapped to become general managers and coaches. Keith Rabalais, 56, has been hired as general manager of the central Louisiana E.L.S., which covers nine parishes surrounding Alexandria, a city of 50,000 that is at the heart of the league. 
 Mr. Rabalais started a quick oil-change business, similar to Jiffy Lube, in 1979 and expanded it to six locations. He sold the business to Quaker State in 1996 and retired at 46, but he became bored with golf and sought a way to keep his hand in commerce. He, in turn, recruited coaches like Edwin J. Caplan, 75, who had spent 43 years in a family retail business in Alexandria. 
 Mr. Caplan noted that Alexandria has always been a farming community, a sleepy town without much entrepreneurial zeal. But the completion of an interstate highway five years ago has been a boon to the economy and a catalyst for new entrepreneurs. 
 Mr. Caplan is coaching the single A team, which is made up of 12 entrepreneurs, all in dissimilar businesses. He meets one on one with each of them every week and holds a team meeting each month. The single A group is a step ahead of the rookies but still struggles with broader issues of finance and long-term visions for their businesses.
 ''I have one guy who runs an extremely successful grocery business,'' Mr. Caplan said. ''But I looked at his financial statement and he was carrying a pretty good cash balance, around $100,000, and yet his bank was charging him $12,000 a year. I asked him what that charge was for, and he didn't know. They told him it was for 'bank charges.' I urged him to question his bank and suggested he could do better with a local bank. He switched banks and saved that $12,000 charge, plus he got 5 percent interest on his $100,000.''
 In West Virginia, where the league has more than 90 entrepreneurs, Mark Burdette, 35, is general manager of the Advantage Valley E.L.S., based in Charleston. Mr. Burdette says the baseball analogy is an apt one because there are definite differences in skills between rookies and double A entrepreneurs. Grouping fledgling business owners together by skill level and working with them in teams is a potent model, he said.
 ''There is accountability, not just to the coach, but to your peers,'' Mr. Burdette said. ''If one team member doesn't come in with a game plan, 11 others get on him.''
 Dr. David Clayman, 60, a clinical and forensic psychologist, is a double A entrepreneur in Charleston and ''an entrepreneur addict in recovery.'' Dr. Clayman's confidence took a big hit when his former practice failed and he lost everything. He is back in his own private practice and joined the league ''because I did not want to make the same mistakes again.''
 ''I learned how to say, 'I don't know' and that you don't have to be a major leaguer to be a success,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Agency Building New Jersey Schools Says Funds Are Too Low for All Projects

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 25 

 BODY:
The Schools Construction Corporation, embattled for the last two years for its failure to complete projects, said on Wednesday that it had the money to build or rehabilitate 32 schools in poor districts rather than the 59 projects that New Jersey officials outlined last summer. 
 Scott Weiner, chief executive of the corporation, said planning for the remaining 27 projects from last year's list would continue gradually in hopes that the State Legislature would eventually authorize the money to complete them. Nine of those were scheduled to start this summer but will now be deferred.
Obtaining any new funding -- or significant support from Gov. Jon S. Corzine's administration -- has been difficult of late for the much-criticized schools construction agency. The agency has been undergoing a sweeping reorganization since a 2005 inspector general's report found that it was ''vulnerable to mismanagement, fiscal malfeasance, conflicts of interest, and waste, fraud and abuse.''
 The agency began in 2002 with more than $6 billion in borrowed funds to build or rehabilitate about 400 schools in the 31 poorest school districts in the state, known as Abbott districts because of a landmark court case. But as a result of the problems cited by the inspector general and other shortcomings, the agency found in 2005 that it had enough money to complete only 59 of the projects, delaying 315 others.
 Now, the agency has about $639 million on hand -- enough to finish the 32 projects, but about $600 million short for all 59. 
 That shortfall itself ballooned from $400 million last summer, a change that Mr. Weiner attributed to emergency spending, inflation and construction delays. He said, however, that the agency had gotten better about prioritizing projects based on educational needs and construction logistics.
 More than $5 billion, apparently, has been spent in the past five years on land acquisition and planning; no projects have been completed. 
 The inspector general's revelations started widespread criticism of the agency among lawmakers who continue to question, even with the pending reorganization, whether it is up to the task of building schools.
 The new plan by the agency comes two weeks after the Education Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Newark, filed suit to compel the Legislature to authorize new funds for the construction effort.
 The center represented children in the state's poorer districts in a 1998 court case that led to state borrowing to finance the construction agency. David G. Sciarra, executive director of the center, said Wednesday's school construction report should be ''a wake-up call'' to the lawmakers.
 ''We have kids and teachers in schools under conditions that should not be tolerated,'' he said. ''The state is legally obligated to fully fund improvements in the poorer districts, and the longer the wait, the more the costs increase.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 1, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a reduction in the number of schools that the New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation says it can build or rehabilitate with the money it has on hand referred incorrectly to the status of the agency's previous projects and to their costs. Fifty-six -- not zero -- projects have been completed in the past five years, including 30 new schools and 26 major renovations. The more than $5 billion spent so far includes $1.25 billion for these projects as well as land acquisition and planning for others; the $5 billion was not spent on land purchases and planning costs alone.

HEADLINE: In Park Plan, A New Life For Spaces Long Closed

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Changes for the city's 29,000-acre park system are even more ambitious than initially detailed by the mayor in his 25-year plan for a greener New York, and include reopening the High Bridge and the McCarren Park swimming pool, officials said yesterday.
 The High Bridge, the city's oldest standing bridge, will get a $65 million face-lift over about two years beginning in 2008, said the parks commissioner, Adrian Benepe. 
The pedestrian bridge, which was completed in 1848 to connect Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, was shuttered during the 1960s; officials had deemed it a safety hazard because people had been dropping rocks and other objects from it onto passing boats. 
 The McCarren Park pool, built in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 1936 and closed in 1984, is one of 11 giant swimming pools built in the city as part of the Works Progress Administration. The pool, which could accommodate 6,800 bathers, will be reduced in size by about one third and reopened as an Olympic size pool. The work is budgeted at $50 million, and officials expect it to begin this summer and take a couple of years. 
 Details of the city's plan to reopen the bridge and the pool were not discussed when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg outlined his PlaNYC initiative on Sunday, but were confirmed yesterday by the Department of Parks and Recreation.
 Other elements of the $1.2 billion parks plan include planting one million new trees; working to ensure that every New Yorker will live within a 10-minute walk of a park by 2030; building lighting fixtures at 36 athletic fields to allow for nighttime play; and refurbishing portions of several large parks that have fallen into disrepair.
 ''It has been the perfect alignment of planets: a healthy economy and an administration that understands the importance of parks,'' Mr. Benepe said. 
 While parks advocates generally praised the plan, they warned that the new money will mean little if more attention -- and funding -- is not given to maintaining the city's parks and sports fields.
 ''We can meet the goal of having everyone live near a park because 75 percent of people already live within 10 minutes of parkland, but what do you get when you get to that park -- and is it a park or a playground?'' said Christian DiPalermo, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, who was consulted by the city during the planning process. ''To make it a wise investment, it must be backed up by maintenance.''
 Mr. Benepe said the initiative included funds for new gardeners and workers to prune trees, an allocation that has been almost unheard of in recent years. The result is that trees in the city will be pruned every seven years, instead of the current 10 years, he said.
 ''I think there was a recognition that you couldn't build new parks without maintenance money,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''It's a great precedent that is being established here, and I hope it continues in future administrations.''
 At least one advocate, however, was somewhat skeptical of the plan, saying it was little more than a drop in the bucket toward transforming the city's park system, where some parks are rarely used because they have become dominated by homeless encampments, drug users and weeds 10 feet high.
 ''These are good individual projects, but when taken as a whole, they will have very little measurable impact on the system,'' said Geoffrey Croft, president of NYC Parks Advocates. 
 To meet its goal of having each person live within a half-mile walk to a park, the mayor's initiative calls for opening public school playgrounds after school hours, during summers and on weekends; creating at least one new public plaza in each of the city's 59 community board districts; and expanding the Greenstreets program, which turns street medians into miniparks. The city said it would build 400 new Greenstreets spaces by 2017, bringing the total to about 3,000. 
 The plan also calls for planting 250,000 new street trees, in addition to the city's current 600,000 trees, during the next decade, with a goal of a total of one million new saplings on public and private property by 2030. 
 The $118 million price tag for the program includes the cost of planting each tree -- from $1,100 to $1,700 apiece -- and hiring 15 new forestry workers.
 The most ambitious part of the initiative may be in providing play space in areas with many children but few parks.
 The parks standard set by the Trust for Public Land, a private, nonprofit conservation group, is 2.5 acres of parkland per 1,000 people -- a ratio that 90 percent of city neighborhoods do not meet, according to the national organization.
 City officials acknowledge that New York regularly fails to meet its even lower standard of providing at least 1.5 acres of park space for every 1,000 people and one playground for every 1,250 children. 
 According to the city, 97 of 188 neighborhoods -- most in low-income areas of the Bronx, Brooklyn and southeast Queens -- have more than 1,250 children per playground.
 In East Flatbush, Brooklyn, there are 56,000 people for just 4.8 acres of parks and other open space -- about 0.09 acres per 1,000 people. The neighborhood's 12,000 children share three playgrounds, the city said.
 Because of the cost of land in the city, which generally prohibits building large new parks or playgrounds, the initiative relies on working with what already exists but has become unusable through age and lack of maintenance, officials said.
 So instead of building new playgrounds, the plan calls for opening playgrounds that are now closed during after-school hours.
 The city has focused on 290 playgrounds in neighborhoods that lack other suitable play space for some 360,000 children.
 Due to disrepair, however, the city said only about 69 of those playgrounds could be opened immediately. The others need to have unsafe play surfaces and equipment replaced.

HEADLINE: After First Steps, Saudi Reformers See Efforts Stall

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Rasheed Abou Alsamh contributed reporting from Riyadh.

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
It was a scene to warm the heart of any democrat. Here in this autocratic kingdom, elected city councilmen vowed to stand up for poor fishermen and ask the government to ensure that a large section of seafront on which a new university is planned be left accessible to local residents.
 After an hour of vigorous discussion recently, Jidda's City Council actually passed a resolution calling for the waterfront to remain open to the people.
But there was a catch: The resolution is nonbinding, its wording will not be made public, and it is unlikely to have any impact on the government's plans. 
 Two years ago, largely at the urging of the Bush administration, the first elections in Saudi history were held for municipal councils in a small number of cities, including Jidda, Riyadh and Mecca. Only men could vote and only half the members were elected, but still the elections were hailed as emblems of change. 
 Increasingly, however, the councils are being dismissed as symbols of the opposite: political stagnation. 
 ''We thought all you do is call for elections and you're done,'' lamented Abdullah al-Otaibi, an advocate of political change who gave up and moved to Dubai last year to help open a research center. ''Now we know things won't work that easily.''
 There are many reasons that democratic change has been put on the back burner, including an economic boom fueled by high oil prices and a more aggressive regional foreign policy, Saudi advocates of such change say.
 ''The curse of the oil money is that it has stopped all reforms,'' said Sulaiman al-Hattlan, editor in chief of Forbes Arabia, based in Dubai, and a Saudi advocate. ''The more money you have, the more arrogant you become, because you think you can implement anything your way.''
 Over the past year, the government has cracked down on advocates of change, placed restrictions on their meetings and even scrapped some long-promised initiatives. The city councils have proved powerless in the face of Saudi Arabia's ingrained governmental bureaucracy and a decidedly vague mandate. According to one council member, more than half the decisions made by the councils have not been carried out. Most of the others have been in support of the central government.
 ''The people in the councils want to make you think that they're working, but ultimately they are powerless,'' said Bassim Alim, a prominent Jidda lawyer and an advocate of change. ''The rest is all for show,'' he said.
 It was not supposed to be this way.
 After 15 Saudis took part in the attacks of 9/11, and a wave of terrorism hit the kingdom itself from 2004 to 2005, many Saudis argued that stifling political and economic conditions here had turned Saudi Arabia into fertile ground for extremism.
 King Abdullah -- at the time, the crown prince -- set out on a campaign for change, spearheading national dialogues, beginning new programs and popularizing the language of reform. The environment reinvigorated campaigners throughout the country who began openly calling for political change.
 In 2005, the government held elections for new city council bodies, allowing for half the 14 members of each council to be elected by the local population and the rest to be appointed by the government. 
 Some change has occurred. The country's dreaded vice police force has been forced to tone itself down, and women have seen some of the most overbearing restrictions on day-to-day life eased, though they are still forbidden to do things most women take for granted, like driving. King Abdullah has also put into effect an important constitutional change that provides for senior members of the royal family to elect a crown prince from among candidates named by the next king. 
 Some laws pertaining to public gatherings and criminal procedures were also changed, Mr. Alim said. The city council elections, meanwhile, proved to be a symbolic step that has encouraged more Saudis to step forward and complain, council members say. 
 Still, many political reform efforts have slowed considerably, if not come to a halt, advocates say. As the fruits of high oil prices flooded the country's coffers and allowed the government to reassert its position as a cradle-to-grave patron of its people, the sense of crisis has ebbed and the impetus for many changes has subsided, they say. 
 Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's newly assertive foreign policy, focused on quelling the Middle East's numerous crises while responding to Iran's encroachment into the region, has focused Saudis' attention outside their borders, further damping the impetus for change. 
 Advocates for political change also point to a longstanding split within the royal family itself. Matrouk al-Falleh, a prominent Saudi change advocate in Riyadh, said he noticed the split after he and a group of his compatriots presented King Abdullah, then the crown prince, with a petition calling for a constitutional monarchy in early 2003. The prince encouraged the men, but two weeks later, Prince Naif, Saudi Arabia's mercurial interior minister, appeared to squelch the discussion, noting in an interview with the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Seyassa that the men had ''misunderstood Prince Abdullah.''
 Mr. Falleh said: ''The future of reform depends on the senior princes and how they deal with matters of state. As the older generation dies out and the number of newer princes and princesses grows, I see a diminishing cake for them to share. This will lead to further conflict over power and money in the near future.'' 
 In addition to all the internal dynamics, waning attention from the Bush administration for democratization has further damped interest in Western-style political change. 
 Many Saudis have abandoned the change agenda, political analysts say, focusing instead on more easily attainable social goals, or simply jumping on the sectarian bandwagon and riding fears of Iran. 
 Government officials still make a point of mentioning reform and praise change, but they uniformly emphasize that it must come slowly and gradually. In the meantime, security officials have grown less tolerant of calls for things like a constitutional monarchy and elections of the consultative Shura Council. In February, Saudi Arabia's security forces rounded up 10 men connected to the country's reform movement in two cities, Jidda and Medina, charging them with financing terrorism. 
 Security officials said the men, whose names were not initially disclosed, were collecting money and smuggling it to ''suspicious bodies'' in Iraq. But a day later it emerged that at least three of the men signed a petition directed at the king calling for a new constitution based on Islamic law, curbs on the powers of the Interior Ministry, an election of members of the Shura Council and a more equitable allocation of Saudi Arabia's wealth and land.
 Shocked reform advocates saw the arrests as a signal of how low their fortunes had fallen. The group did submit the petition to the king in April, but members said they had heard no response.
 ''You see the absurdity of calling some of these men terrorists,'' Mr. Falleh said. ''They are just doing this to kill off the reform movement and prevent any sympathy toward those were arrested.'' 
 Mr. Alim, who represents several of the men, does acknowledge that one of them had been to Iraq twice under the auspices of the Saudi Red Crescent but insists that his visits were strictly humanitarian. Mr. Alim said he, too, would have been arrested if he had signed the petition. Instead, he said, the government has barred him from traveling abroad. 
 Mr. Hattlan of Forbes Arabia said: ''Some people feel it's a hopeless case, that the government is the only force for change. People don't want to enter a losing war. Society is not on your side, and you have a long way to go.''
 Jidda's City Council, like other city councils around the country, has gone to great lengths to try to bring about some change, but many councilmen admit they are trying to make the most of a difficult situation. By their own admission, however, the councilmen have yet to make a mark on municipal decision-making. They insist, however, that they may well be the real catalysts for change in the country. But first, their powers must be expanded.
 ''The picture is not very rosy, but it is not all that gloomy either,'' insisted Hussain al-Bar, who was elected to Jidda's council in 2005. ''The problem is that people here expect to see fast wins. But what we do, real change, takes time, and a lot of it.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 28, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on April 26 about the restricted activities of city councilmen chosen in municipal elections in Saudi Arabia two years ago attributed an erroneous distinction to those elections. While they were the first in which all men outside the military could vote (women are not allowed to vote), the elections were not the first ever held in Saudi Arabia. (A far more limited form of voting was introduced in Mecca in 1925, which lasted for roughly a decade. In later years, until the 1960s, some councilmen were elected in selected cities by small groups of voters.) A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message the day the article ran; this correction was delayed for research.

HEADLINE: A Unified Voice Argues the Case for U.S. Manufacturing

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
United States Steel, Alcoa, Goodyear and other manufacturing companies have formed an unusual alliance with the United Steelworkers, aiming to preserve and promote manufacturing in the United States.
 One of the first issues that the group, the Alliance for American Manufacturing, plans to address is how American factory owners and workers have been hurt by what the group says is the Chinese government's improper currency manipulation and industry subsidies.
The United States has lost one-sixth of its factory jobs over the last six years because of many factors, including automation, imports and relocation overseas in search of lower-cost labor and proximity to developing markets. 
 ''The hemorrhaging of manufacturing jobs is hurting America down to the local level,'' said Terrence D. Straub, United States Steel's senior vice president for public policy and government affairs. ''Until and unless there is a political understanding of that -- and political attention paid to that -- our fear is much won't change and in 10 years the American manufacturing base could be gone.''
 The alliance, which plans to announce its formation today in newspaper and online advertisements, asserts that the decline of manufacturing undercuts America's long-term competitiveness, its research capabilities and its ability to produce sophisticated weapons needed for national security.
 The alliance aims to be partly a policy research organization, tackling subjects like international trade practices and what alliance officials say is inadequate enforcement of trading regulations by the American government. The group also plans to focus on health policy because of concerns that high health costs have hurt American competitiveness. 
 Another focus will be energy policy; for example, the group may examine ways to produce renewable energy in a way that creates manufacturing jobs.
 ''The image of manufacturing has taken a beating -- quite unfairly -- especially with the younger generation that views information technology and services as being hip and cool,'' said Scott Paul, the alliance's executive director, who used to work in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s industrial department. He said the group wants to ''reconnect the American people with the importance of manufacturing and what it means in their lives and what it has meant in terms of creating good, middle-class jobs.''
 The alliance is financed through labor contract provisions requiring the companies to contribute to public education and policy efforts. The alliance's other members are Allegheny Technologies, Mittal Steel and AK Steel, and participants say they hope other companies and unions will either join the alliance or cooperate with it.
 Leo W. Gerard, the president of United Steelworkers, which is based in Pittsburgh, said his union pushed to create the alliance because it believed that the National Association of Manufacturers had not been forceful enough in seeking to preserve American manufacturing jobs.
 ''The fundamental reason we've formed this is we've lost three million manufacturing jobs, and there doesn't appear to be a strong pro-American manufacturing voice out there,'' said Mr. Gerard, whose union represents 800,000 steel, aluminum, rubber, paper and chemical workers. ''The so-called manufacturers' organizations that exist are part of the problem. The National Association of Manufacturers promotes the loss of manufacturing. The N.A.M. has become the voice of multinationals giving away our jobs, of setting up operations overseas.''
 Mr. Gerard asserted that the National Association of Manufacturers had not been forceful enough in challenging China's trade violations because many members of the association had operations in China and did not want to anger China's government.
 Patrick J. Cleary, a senior vice president with the National Association of Manufacturers, welcomed the formation of the alliance, but he took issue with claims that his group was not doing enough to promote and protect American manufacturing.
 ''Our mission statement is, we're here to promote manufacturing in America and we're here to create a climate in America where manufacturing can not only survive, but can prosper,'' Mr. Cleary said, adding: ''We take a back seat to no one on fighting the battle on Chinese currency. We started it, we led it and we put it on the administration's radar screen.''
 Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based policy research organization that has long promoted American industry, said of the new alliance, ''In a way, you can look at this as the last stand of American manufacturing.''
 Mr. Prestowitz, who is not working with the alliance, said the group was an outgrowth of tensions within the National Association of Manufacturers. 
 ''There's a civil war going on within the American manufacturing establishment,'' he said. ''It's a divide between companies that are global manufacturers and companies that are mainly U.S. manufacturers.''
 These companies have clashed over such issues as how vigorously Washington should challenge China's trade practices and whether promotion of free-trade agreements helps financial companies at the expense of its manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Singapore's Banking Secrecy Draws the Wealthy, and Their Money

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, April 25 

 BODY:
This affluent city-state of 4.5 million people is aiming to be a sanctuary for the world's wealthy and their money, Asia's answer to Geneva and Zurich.
 Singapore, with its reputation for authoritarian order and safety, has long relied on luring multinational corporations for manufacturing jobs and economic growth. But with China's rise as an industrial powerhouse, it started chasing a succession of economic fads -- from technology to pharmaceuticals to stem-cell research -- in search of a fresh elixir.
Now Singapore, a tiny enclave at the tip of the Malay peninsula, is trying to carve out a new niche for itself in the global economy by bolstering banking secrecy laws and offering generous tax incentives.
 ''I can't think of any other place where private banking is growing so much as in Singapore,'' said Henrik T. Mikkelsen, a private banker at Commerzbank in Singapore. ''We want to be the Switzerland of Asia.'' 
 It may lack the stunning Alpine scenery, but officials here hope that luring the wealthy and their bankers will not only diversify the economy but also help offset a declining birth rate and increase Singapore's stagnant population with what is known here as ''foreign talent.'' 
 ''It creates jobs, it builds a service industry, it generates income and, on the immigration issue, it also supplements our shortfall in fertility,'' said Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore's minister for community development, youth and sports.
 Almost 40 private banks now have regional operations in Singapore, including Swiss stalwarts like Bank Julius Baer. Citigroup's headquarters for all private banking outside the United States is now in Singapore, as is the global banking headquarters of Standard Chartered Bank of Britain.
 The estimated $150 billion in private wealth they manage here is still just a sliver of the $1.7 trillion managed by Swiss bankers. But by all accounts it is growing quickly, fed by wealth pouring in from Asia's fast-growing economies, Middle Eastern oil money, and Japanese and Europeans fleeing new efforts to tax their offshore earnings.
 The bankers cater to people like Robert V. Chandran, who emigrated to the United States from India and made fortunes in California real estate and the fuel oil business. In 2005, contemplating retirement, he moved his company and family here, bought a condominium downtown and space in a waterfront resort with parking for yachts. He traded in his American passport for one from Singapore.
 Mr. Chandran said that he was lured by Singapore's blend of Western conveniences with Asian values and by the government's zeal for keeping Singapore competitive. ''They don't have global taxation,'' he said, which means that his capital gains and interest income are not taxed here. (Singapore only imposes an income tax of 20 percent on income earned in Singapore.) 
 Singapore's vision for the high life can be found at Sentosa Cove, a secluded development on the edge of a small island theme park off Singapore's coast. Mr. Chandran is building his home there, among sites that sold for as much as $9.9 million each. Sentosa Cove has a 400-berth marina with 10 spots for megayachts, two golf courses and a casino resort on the way. 
 ''The government wants to create Sentosa as a playground for the rich and famous,'' said Joseph Tan, director of residential property at CB Richard Ellis. ''They're trying to build it as our Monte Carlo.''
 Providing services for Asia's superrich is undoubtedly a growth market. The booming region is churning out at least 200,000 new millionaires a year, according to a recent report from Merrill Lynch and CapGemini, prompting comparisons with America's Gilded Age.
 ''The wealth of the wealthy in emerging markets is no different than the wealth of the wealthy in the Rockefeller days,'' said Roman Scott, who left a job analyzing the industry for management consultant BCG last year to start his own investment advisory firm, the Calamander Group. ''It's the robber baron thing.''
 In a region known for its poverty, corruption and political turmoil, this port enclave has long served as a refuge for wealthy ethnic Chinese from Malaysia and Indonesia, who rely on Singapore's top-notch health care and schools. For many, Singapore's gleaming infrastructure, efficient bureaucracy and stable government more than compensate for its lack of press freedom, political debate and artistic ferment.
 While the latest influx of wealthy foreigners is pushing costs up, property prices are still low compared with London or New York. Tax rates are low as well. Singapore does not tax capital gains or interest income. Its top income tax rate is 20 percent, and it does not tax income earned outside Singapore. 
 Much of the decision to promote private banking here was the result of an official reassessment conducted in 2002 in the midst of the global recession and China's investment boom. Singapore convened an Economic Review Committee from the private sector and government to chart a new course.
 ''They were facing China with no real game plan,'' said Robert Stein, a former head of Deutsche Bank's Asian operations who headed the committee's financial services working group. 
 The panel recommended that Singapore focus on luring hedge funds, private equity firms, insurers and private banks. Afterward, Singapore exempted foreign-earned income from taxation and modified its trust laws, guaranteeing the right of trust holders to determine who inherits their estate.
 Bankers in Singapore say this is especially attractive to clients from Europe, where courts often overrule wills to give relatives a fair share, and from the Middle East, where Islamic courts sometimes pass over wives and children to hand over entire estates to a deceased's father and brother.
 Singapore had already strengthened its banking secrecy laws in 2001. While many banks are moving their back offices to India, bankers here say Singapore's secrecy rules are so tight that they are moving the data centers handling their private banking transactions from India to Singapore. 
 Concerns have emerged, however, that Singapore may also be attracting wealthy individuals who have something to hide.
 Before his arrest in 2005 on charges of corruption and fraud, Gianpiero Fiorani, the former chief executive of Italy's Banca Popolare Italiana, stashed some of his assets in Singapore. The Japanese fund manager and shareholder activist Yoshiaki Murakami moved his fund, MAC Asset Management, to Singapore before his arrest last year on charges of insider trading. And in December, the police in Shanghai arrested an unidentified Singaporean for running an underground bank that shuttled money between China and Singapore.
 Bankers here say they are under pressure to know the nature of their clients' wealth -- Singapore's secrecy rules do not extend to anyone involved in terrorism or smuggling. And the authorities here say they are not trying to attract tax evaders.
 ''The Singaporeans have done an excellent job of balancing a pro-business stance with a regulatory environment that creates a well-disciplined environment for private banking,'' said Mr. Stein, now a director in London at the German bank WestLB.
 Still, many governments are unhappy about the prospect of losing tax revenue to another country. A ''stop tax haven abuse'' bill, introduced in February by three United States senators -- two Democrats, Carl Levin of Michigan and Barack Obama of Illinois, and a Republican, Norm Coleman of Minnesota -- includes Singapore (along with Hong Kong and Switzerland) in its list of ''probable locations for U.S. tax evasion.''
 Meanwhile, the European Union has been trying to persuade Singapore to follow the lead of Switzerland and other European tax havens, which have agreed to share information on accounts or collect a withholding tax. 
 Germano Mirabile, a policy officer at the European Union's Taxation and Customs Union Directorate-General, said Singapore had not yet responded to Brussels' overtures.
 Because tax rates in Asia are generally low, Singapore's lure to Asians is less about escaping taxes and more about protecting assets from political vagaries. Many Chinese, for example, keep some of their earnings in Hong Kong. But for those who fear Hong Kong is still within reach of Chinese authorities, Singapore has become increasingly popular.
 ''A lot of Chinese would like to come to Singapore because Hong Kong is still China,'' said Kong Eng Huat, managing director of Merrill's private banking operations in Singapore.
 Some put more than their money in Singapore. Many wealthy Chinese executives have bought homes in Singapore and moved their families here. ''They want their kids to have a safe environment, clean water, better air,'' said Shi Xu, vice president of Singapore's Hua Yuan Association, a club for mainland immigrants.
 Singapore's proximity to South Asia is also luring ethnic Indians, both those from India and those like Mr. Chandran from the Indian diaspora. Indian nationals recently emerged as the biggest group of foreign buyers of prime real estate in Singapore, after citizens of neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia.
 Roughly 60 percent of the buyers at Sentosa Cove are foreigners, according to the development's staff. Sentosa's residents get a choice of two views; they can survey one of the world's busiest container ports or one of the world's busiest sea lanes. 
 That may suit shipping magnates like Mr. Chandran more than most, but as an added inducement, foreigners buying property in Sentosa Cove are put on a fast track by immigration authorities for permanent residency. 
 ''They think of everything,'' said Jackson Tai, the American chief executive of Singapore's largest bank, DBS. Recalling B. F. Skinner's utopian novel, ''Walden Two,'' he said, ''Singapore is Walden Three.''

HEADLINE: Wolfowitz Escalates Battle to Stay at Bank

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25 

 BODY:
Escalating his campaign to remain president of the World Bank, Paul D. Wolfowitz accused the bank's board on Wednesday of treating him ''shabbily and unfairly,'' and appealed for more time to defend himself against allegations of favoritism and other matters.
 Mr. Wolfowitz, increasingly isolated at the bank and facing a board seemingly determined to force his resignation, sent a letter to the head of a board panel dealing with issues affecting his leadership, asking to appear before the board next week in the interest of ''fairness to me'' and ''good governance'' at the bank. 
The letter was described by people who had seen it.
 Bank officials described many on the 24-member board as having been taken aback by the tough tone of the letter but said the board appeared likely to grant Mr. Wolfowitz at least some of his request, perhaps by allowing him to appear next week, though not necessarily with his newly hired lawyer, Robert S. Bennett.
 Before Wednesday, the board had seemed to be moving toward some sort of vote as early as this week on Mr. Wolfowitz's ability to continue as president. The board met late Wednesday, but officials said it appeared unlikely to reach any quick conclusions and could put off the response to Mr. Wolfowitz until next week.
 Compounding the problems for Mr. Wolfowitz, the bank's vice presidents have rebuffed his request for them to set up a committee to advise him on improving his management style. The vice presidents did not want to be co-opted into helping his campaign to stay in office, bank officials said.
 Although he appears to be more and more beleaguered, Mr. Wolfowitz attended a White House meeting on Wednesday on malaria eradication, and got a new gesture of support from President Bush.
 ''I appreciate very much the fact that the World Bank is taking the lead in eradicating poverty in places like Africa, and Paul Wolfowitz, thank you for your leadership of the World Bank,'' Mr. Bush said, turning to his appointee.
 On the other hand, evidence of European opposition to Mr. Wolfowitz continued to spread as the European Parliament, the legislature of the European Union, called on him to resign to avoid undermining the bank's own campaign against corruption in poor countries.
 At issue is Mr. Wolfowitz's role in arranging for a pay and promotion package for Shaha Ali Riza, his companion, when he became bank president in 2005. Ms. Riza had been a bank employee for seven years and was detailed to the State Department to avoid a potential conflict of interest for Mr. Wolfowitz.
 But the bank's board is also investigating allegations that he has relied on a small coterie of aides, also with high salaries, and that he has promoted Bush administration policies in the area of family planning and climate change.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's defense has focused on demonstrating that he acted in good faith with Ms. Riza, taking a direct role in her pay raise only after being directed to do so by ethics officials at the bank and on its board. But these same officials said they never authorized him to order such a large salary increase for her.
 The bank's board had earlier signaled its disinclination to allow Mr. Bennett, a well-known Washington lawyer and deal maker, to appear with Mr. Wolfowitz or to give him the month he had requested to make his case.
 The board, whose members represent various countries or groups of countries, is considering a number of options. The most extreme would be to invoke governance rules allowing the board to remove a president outright, though some officials said that was unlikely.
 Alternatively, the board could reprimand Mr. Wolfowitz or call for his resignation with a kind of no-confidence vote. Another alternative would be to do nothing but negotiate with the United States, the Europeans and others for Mr. Wolfowitz to resign voluntarily.
 The board members are divided, though only tactically; the majority still want him out, various officials said. The centers of opposition are in Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia and Latin America.
 But the board was described as puzzled and put off by Mr. Wolfowitz's decision, disclosed this week, to bring in Mr. Bennett, who is known as a litigator but also as someone who can make a deal in situations that seem beyond compromise.
 For example, as the lawyer for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, he got a settlement of a lawsuit charging sexual misconduct brought by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee. 
 He also negotiated a deal with a federal prosecutor last year leading to freedom for Judith Miller, a reporter for The New York Times who was jailed for refusing to testify in the investigation of a leak of the identify of Valerie Plame, a Central Intelligence Agency employee.
 A top European official involved in setting bank policy said there could be a deal avoiding a censure of Mr. Wolfowitz but that it had to involve Mr. Wolfowitz leaving the bank. 
 ''There are a lot of people at the bank asking, 'What is Wolfowitz thinking?' '' the official said. ''It just looks like Wolfowitz is ramping up the pressure. I think the bank directors are looking for a deal to avoid a confrontation. But he's got to go as part of it. Letting him stay is not an option.''

HEADLINE: Canada Announces Goals For Reducing Emissions

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, April 26 

 BODY:
Canadian industries must cut the rate at which they produce gases linked to global warming by 18 percent over the next three years, the federal government said Thursday.
 While the new plan offers an accelerated timetable compared to an earlier proposal from the Conservative government, it falls well short of the country's commitments under the Kyoto protocol on climate change.
Even before hearing public reaction, the environment minister, John Baird, acknowledged that the plan, which calls for a total reduction of greenhouse-related gases by 2020, would be criticized. 
 ''Our plan strikes a balance between the perfection that some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in the industry seek to protect,'' he said at a news conference in Toronto.
 Large emitters of industrial greenhouse gas that are unable to meet the timetable will have other options, including contributing to a fund that will be used to develop pollution control technologies at an initial rate of 15 Canadian dollars a metric ton for emissions beyond their target. Companies will also be given credit for emission reductions that they have achieved from 1992 through last year.
 Nevertheless, Jayson Myers, the chief economist for Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, an Ottawa-based trade group, said that many companies would struggle with the plan, particularly during the first three years.
 ''It is going to be very difficult for companies to meet these targets,'' Mr. Myers said, adding that paperwork associated with the program will add to corporate costs.
 But several environmental groups said that because the 18 percent reduction is tied to units of production, not overall output, total greenhouse emissions in Canada may continue to rise.
 Stephen Hazell, executive director of the Sierra Club of Canada, said that Alberta's oil sands projects, which are an increasingly important energy source for the United States, would probably increase production by twice the rate they are required to curb per-unit gas emissions during the three-year period.
 ''The use reductions based on emission intensity is deceptive,'' Mr. Hazell said. ''In the oil sands, we may see overall emissions still increasing by 4 to 6 percent a year.''
 Pierre R. Alvarez, the president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, however, rejected suggestions that his industry would not make a significant contribution or face significant costs.
 ''This is the toughest target the oil and gas industry will face in the world, at least in the short term,'' Mr. Alvarez said.
 The government's plan for the auto industry is less clear. Mr. Baird said that Canada would work with the United States to develop a continental fuel efficiency standard that could become effective in 2011.
 Basel E. Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, said he was relieved that the government did not attempt to establish a special standard for Canada. Because most automobiles made in Canada are exported to the United States, Mr. Hargrove said that special Canadian rules might have prompted manufacturers to curb Canadian production.
 Over all, Mr. Baird estimated that meeting the targets would cost the Canadian economy about 7 billion to 8 billion Canadian dollars a year, an amount that Mr. Myers said may be understated.
 Despite that expense, if the plan works as forecast environmental groups said that Canada would be 8 to 13 years late in meeting its Kyoto commitments.
 Mr. Baird, however, said that those targets, which were agreed to by a previous Liberal government, were unrealistic.

HEADLINE: Where No-Frills Fast Food (the Real Thing) Was Born

BYLINE: By JOEL KELLER

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY may be the diner capital of the world, but Rhode Island is the diner's birthplace.
 The Naugahyde and Formica restaurants that sizzle with breakfast all day long, and where the waitresses call you ''Hon,'' had their start in Providence more than 130 years ago. Because of Rhode Island's diner heritage, as well as its large working-class population, an estimated 75 to 80 diners and lunch counters still dot the tiny state. A dozen of them are in the ''rail car'' style, where customers get two choices of seating: if the line of booths along the windows is full, they can plop themselves on a stool at the counter.
For those obsessed with the history and design of diners, Providence -- with a handful of them in and around the city -- and its neighbors are a dream destination. The city's riverfront, revitalized downtown and Colonial-era houses are also significant draws. 
 For a main course of diner history, the first place a dinerphile should go -- after a hearty breakfast, of course -- is the Culinary Archives and Museum at the Harborside campus of Johnson & Wales University, which has a school of culinary arts. The museum has 25,000 square feet of exhibition space in a converted warehouse. Visitors immediately come face to face with a stainless steel-and-neon entrance. Stepping through that threshold brings them to a large diner exhibition that takes the viewer through the history of diner style, from its humble beginnings in Providence to the sprawling retro restaurants that have opened nationwide in the last 20 years. 
 Much of the collection, from photos and menus to stools and floor tile, is on loan from Richard J. S. Gutman, who has been acquiring diner memorabilia since 1970, when he was an architecture student at Cornell University. Johnson & Wales asked Mr. Gutman, who has written four books on diners, to serve as guest curator for the exhibit, which opened in 2002; three years later, the university asked Mr. Gutman to become the museum's curator.
 Mr. Gutman can regale you with tales of diner history, starting in 1872 when Walter Scott parked a converted horse wagon outside various industrial locations in Providence, waiting for shift workers to leave for the day. Ask him what the closest existing relative to those first movable trailers is, and he doesn't hesitate to point you to Haven Brothers, a hot dog stand housed in a trailer parked downtown that has been in the Haven family since the 1890s. 
 Why did Mr. Gutman, 57, devote his adult life to diners? ''I guess I was fortunate to be one of the first people to say, 'Hey! This is Americana.' This is part of what makes us a little bit different from other places around the world. This is our version of a pub or a bistro.'' 
 He spoke over breakfast at the Seaplane Diner, a 1950 Jerry O'Mahony model that sits about a mile and a half north of Johnson & Wales, in an area of Providence that's still industrial. Blue-and-yellow Formica booths face the counter. It's not as polished as other diners, but the Seaplane makes a good breakfast: three eggs with linguica, a spicy Portuguese sausage, is $5.75.
 The diner exhibit at the university includes a full soda fountain, along with a vintage Worcester Lunch Car Company model, on display but in the process of restoration, that last served as the Ever Ready Diner in Providence.
 Ask Mr. Gutman what diner to go to after touring the museum, and the first words out of his mouth will very likely be ''the Modern Diner'' in Pawtucket, an industrial suburb north of Providence. The Modern is hard to miss. Just look for the maroon-and-tan dining car that has a large neon sign perched on top. If it's the weekend, there will also be a long line snaking out the door. The diner, a Sterling Streamliner, has been a town staple since 1941, when it first sat in downtown Pawtucket.
 The Modern was rundown when Nick Demou, 50, with his father, Arthur, bought it in 1986 (his current partner is Frank Aguiar, 44). The town allowed Mr. Demou to move it to its current location, on a main street, soon after. ''We had regular house movers actually move it,'' said Mr. Demou, a graduate of Johnson & Wales. ''And in the midst of the move all the tiles just came crumbling down. We put everything back together, and then we rechromed all the stools. The Naugahyde was all replaced.'' 
 Many people waiting in line could sit in a second dining room in a building attached to the diner, but they'd rather wait for a seat in the Streamliner. The Modern is literally a landmark; in 1978, it became the first diner to be registered in the National Register of Historic Places. Its classic details include dark wood trim and chrome backsplashes behind the counter.
 Mr. Demou tends to go beyond standard breakfast and lunch fare; in fact, he encourages customers to order from the specials menu -- laminated signs posted by the door each day. On weekends, the signs stretch floor to ceiling, listing combinations like creme brulee oatmeal ($5.95) and lobster cheese grits ($9.95). Two of the most popular dishes are custard French toast ($7.25) and cranberry-almond pancakes ($6.95).
 Mr. Demou loves seeing the weekend crowds. ''The hot restaurants,'' he said, referring to Providence, ''they're not hot for that long. I've been hot for 21 years.''
 Another of Mr. Gutman's favorites is Jigger's Diner, which is in East Greenwich, about 15 miles south of Providence. It is a 1950 Worcester Lunch Car, wedged into a strip of boutiques, restaurants and local stores on Main Street. An ''Eat Here'' sign dangles below a carved sign that depicts an inviting breakfast. The highlight of the interior is the mahogany trim that runs not only the length of the diner's windowed side, but also along the ceiling. The booths are built of the same wood, complete with slotted benches and ornate coat hooks.
 THE diner has been around since Vilgot Lindbergh, known as Jigger, opened for business in 1917. Iva Reynhout, 39, who also trained at Johnson & Wales, bought the diner in 2000 from Carol Shriner, a farmer who had returned the building to its original style in the 1990s. Ms. Reynhout's training is evident in Jigger's signature breakfasts. It is one of the few places in Rhode Island that serves johnnycakes, a simple combination of cornmeal, water and sugar about the size of a hockey puck (three for $2.25). The diner also makes its own sausages and hash, and has a tasty ''Vermontichristo'' ($4.85), made with Vermont cheddar cheese. 
 Ms. Reynhout says she's in it for the long haul or, at least until one certain day arrives. ''I hope I can do it until the business is 100 years old,'' she said. COZY BOOTHS, SNAPPY SERVICE What'll You Have, Hon? 
 PROVIDENCE is about three hours north and east of New York City. Take Interstate 95 to Exit 22A for downtown Providence. There is also an Amtrak station there, but you will need a rental car to get around. Arrive early enough in the day, and you can eat both breakfast and lunch at diners in and around Providence.
 The Culinary Archives and Museum at the Harborside campus of Johnson & Wales University (315 Harborside Boulevard, 401-598-2805; www.culinary.org) is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is $7 for adults, less for seniors, children and students. Besides the diner exhibition, there are antique cookbooks, vintage stoves and a tavern re-creation. 
 The Seaplane Diner (307 Allens Avenue, 401-941-9547) is open 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. 
 The Modern Diner (364 East Avenue, Pawtucket, 401-726-8390) is open 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sundays. 
 Jigger's Diner (145 Main Street, East Greenwich, 401-884-5388) is open 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sundays; it is also open for dinner from 5 to 8 p.m. Fridays.

HEADLINE: Progress Is Seen on Trade Legislation

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26 

 BODY:
A trip on Air Force One and a talk between President Bush and Representative Charles B. Rangel as they traveled to Mr. Rangel's home district in Harlem this week has suddenly lifted prospects for bipartisan agreement on trade legislation in Congress, officials on both sides said Thursday.
 The officials said that negotiations had resumed between teams led by Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, and Mr. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and that a deal was in sight, clearing the way for approval of the trade legislation. 
''They are talking, they are making progress, and they are hopeful of wrapping this up,'' a Rangel aide said. But he said the talks could spill into next week.
 Aides to Ms. Schwab echoed that view, adding that the turnaround occurred after Mr. Bush and Mr. Rangel gave the two sides a nudge. Before, they were at an impasse, especially over the rights of workers.
 ''Principals and senior staffers have been and will continue to be engaged in talks leading into next week,'' said Gretchen Hamel, a spokeswoman for Ms. Schwab. 
 Democrats favor adding provisions calling for workers' right to organize and a ban on child labor and forced labor in the trading partner countries. The Bush administration has resisted the Democrats' proposals, charging that they constituted a backdoor attempt to change labor laws in the United States.
 At stake in the near term are negotiated trade deals between the Bush administration and South Korea, Panama, Peru and Colombia. All require the approval of Congress, where they face skepticism as polls show that Americans are increasingly fearful of lower trade barriers, cheap imports and job losses.
 Beyond these trade deals, however, the stakes could be larger if an agreement paves the way for an extension of Mr. Bush's authority to negotiate future trade deals and get an expedited vote in Congress. That authority expires June 30.
 If the talks are successful, they will be the first significant bipartisan accord on an economic issue since the new Congress began.
 They may also give impetus to the on-again, off-again negotiations over a global trade deal among more than 180 nations under the so-called Doha Round, named after the city in Qatar where talks began five years ago.
 Pascal Lamy, general director of the World Trade Organization, visited Washington earlier in the week and called on lawmakers to support the global trade talks, in which the United States is being asked to lower trade barriers on farm products in return for greater access overseas for its goods and services.
 The global trade talks have foundered over the inability of the main actors -- the United States, Europe, India and Brazil -- to agree on formulas for lowering all their barriers. An agreement among those countries could set the stage for others to follow their lead.
 Lawmakers say that, as a practical matter, they are not likely to take up Mr. Bush's request for renewed trade negotiating authority without progress on global trade. Even with progress, most Democrats may not support future deals. Many Democrats won elections last year by opposing trade deals under Mr. Bush.
 Prospects in trade talks with Democrats have ebbed and flowed for weeks. Only last week, Mr. Rangel said it appeared that the administration had rebuffed the Democrats' request for guarantees of labor rights.
 ''There are some people who hate unions so much, they can't see their way clear to supporting this provision,'' he said then.
 But the tone changed after Mr. Bush traveled to Harlem on Tuesday, taking Mr. Rangel with him. They drove along the streets where the congressman grew up.
 ''You can imagine what it's like traveling in the presidential limousine down Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard hearing Rangel say, 'I was raised over here, and here's the hotel I worked in when I was a boy,' '' Mr. Bush said at a charter school. ''You know, the people in Harlem have got a fantastic congressman in Charles Rangel.'' As the audience laughed, Mr. Bush said, ''He can agree with me a few more times, but I don't expect him to.'' 
 In the disagreement of the moment, Democrats have been demanding that trade deals include strict enforcement of environmental laws and even enactment of new laws by trading partner countries, as well as other provisions that would preserve some American laws that bar bidding on certain government contracts by foreign parties.
 But these demands have taken second place to the labor provision, in part because the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would oppose the Latin America and South Korea deals without labor protections, and many Democrats would follow their lead.
 The administration, backed by groups like the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce, has charged that the labor protections, as crafted by Mr. Rangel, would upend American labor laws.
 Specifically, they say that a country could sue to throw out state right-to-work laws, which outlaw workplaces in which employees must join unions or pay union dues. Also in jeopardy, they maintain, would be jobs for teenagers and state practices of using prisoners to make goods for sale to the public.
 Mr. Rangel and the Democrats say these concerns are baseless, since the labor protections would allow challenges only by foreign governments, and only for labor practices that affect international trade.

HEADLINE: Why Won't Companies Invest More?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
To the Federal Reserve, it is puzzling that business investment is not stronger. To business executives, it is only natural. They see relatively few opportunities for investment, and ample reason to send cash to shareholders.
 In a speech to a conference at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College last week, Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, pointed to the housing slowdown as one reason for worry. But then he added that the low level of business investment was the ''second major area of concern,'' one that ''perhaps could pose noticeable downside risks.''
He speculated that businesses might be less optimistic about the economy than the Fed was, and voiced hope that investment would pick up as the economy continued to do fine and companies realized their pessimism was unwarranted. 
 Perhaps so, but the reality is that companies are quite happy spending their profits -- and in many cases, much more -- on buying back their stock.
 I.B.M. shares spurted up this week on the news that it was planning to increase its already substantial spending on repurchases, and in addition, would raise its dividend. 
 The dividend is nice, but at the new quarterly rate of 40 cents a share, it amounts to something like 1.6 percent of the stock price. But if the company spends all the $15 billion it set aside for share repurchases over the next year, it will retire about 10 percent of its shares.
 Most of the money I.B.M. spends on stock will be borrowed, a fact that reflects the friendliness of debt markets, which are quite willing to lend money at low rates to companies with far lower-quality debt than I.B.M. Its Triple-A days are long past, but it still is a high Single-A credit.
 ''We see an opportunity here, because of the strength of the business,'' I.B.M.'s treasurer, Jesse J. Greene, told me. He figures that having gotten out of personal computers, the company's cash flows are more stable and it can easily carry more debt.
 I.B.M.'s planned repurchases are extraordinary, at about twice the going rate for big companies. Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's, estimates the payout ratio of companies in the S.& P. 500 -- adding together dividends and buybacks -- is now 5.3 percent.
 That is well above what Treasury bonds yield, and constitutes one of the most compelling bullish arguments in the stock market now.
 It is also more than double the payout rate that existed in the late 1990s and 2000, before the technology stock bubble burst. Then companies saw ample opportunities for investment. Perhaps the fact that much of that money was wasted has made them more hesitant. 
 A somewhat more cynical explanation for the lack of capital spending was offered at the Levy conference by Robert W. Parenteau, the chief United States economist and strategist for RCM, a money management firm owned by Allianz, the German bank and insurance company.
 ''Companies are lifting their own share prices in a remarkable feat of manipulation,'' he said, suggesting stock option profits were a motivating factor.
 I.B.M. has sent out more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders in each of the last three years. And in the first quarter, before the big new purchase plan was announced, the figure topped 200 percent.
 Mr. Greene of I.B.M. notes that last year the company spent about $15 billion on capital spending, research and development and acquisitions. ''We do not intend any pullback in the investments we make as a result of this decision,'' he said.
 Whether you accept the analysis of Mr. Mishkin, that companies simply do not see a good enough economy to justify more spending, or the much more cynical view of Mr. Parenteau, it is clear that I.B.M. is not alone in wanting to reduce the number of its shares outstanding.
 Such moves help to support share prices, but they do not spur economic growth, which is why the Fed is worried. And they leave corporate America more heavily indebted, a fact that may seem regrettable if, or when, the economy does turn down and profits fall.
 It may turn out that many of the era's big payouts to shareholders were a sign of corporate complacency, not of corporate profitability.

HEADLINE: Climate Panel Sees Need For New Steps On Emissions

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Substantial new efforts will be needed worldwide to stem accelerating growth in greenhouse-gas emissions linked to rising global temperatures, according to a summary of a report being prepared by hundreds of climate scientists and economists working under the auspices of the United Nations. 
 The summary, which is subject to revision, said that efforts to rein in the billions of tons of annual releases of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases would have to begin soon to limit risks of large changes in the climate and their impact on humans and nature.
''Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will determine to a large extent the long-term global mean temperature increase and the corresponding climate change impacts that can be avoided,'' the draft said. 
 The document will undergo substantial revisions during a weeklong meeting starting Monday in Bangkok, said scientists involved in reviewing and writing it, and authors of the report declined to discuss it. 
 Copies of the report's 24-page summary for policy makers have been filtering to environmental groups, one of which provided a copy to The New York Times. 
 Developing countries, where an unparalleled burst of industrialization and construction is under way, offer some of the biggest opportunities for avoiding climate-warming emissions, the draft said, particularly in choices of power plants and building designs. 
 It said that changes in design standards and materials chosen for construction could trim about 30 percent of projected emissions of heat-trapping gases from buildings by 2020, with more than half of the cuts coming in developing countries. The improvements in buildings could come with a net saving to the economy from lower energy costs, it said.
 The report is part of the fourth assessment since 1990 of global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, created nearly 20 years ago to assess evidence that human activities were affecting climate and to review policy options. 
 In its latest climate review, released in February, the panel concluded with near certainty that smokestack and tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases were the dominant cause of recent warming. A second report, released this month, said that ecosystems and climate patterns were already shifting as a result of the warming trend and that substantial risks to people, wildlife and coasts lay ahead. 
 The new report will probably be contentious when it is reviewed in Bangkok by officials from more than 100 countries. Governments have the right to seek some changes. 
 Clashes are likely, in part because this report touches most deeply both on domestic debates over climate, like the tussle in the United States over the need for a bill restricting gas emissions, and the fate of international climate agreements, particularly the Kyoto Protocol.

HEADLINE: When Modern Dance Became More Modern Still

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
 Chance and Circumstance Twenty Years with Cage and Cunningham By Carolyn Brown Illustrated. 645 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $37.50. 
 In the fall of 2003 a boisterous crowd filled the Brooklyn Academy of Music as the Merce Cunningham Dance Company concluded its 50th anniversary season.
 Onstage Mr. Cunningham presided over several rolls of dice to determine the order of music, decor, costumes and lighting for the premiere of ''Split Sides,'' which would prove to be marvelous. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was on hand, as were the Cunningham collaborators Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg and the former company dancer Carolyn Brown. 
The ceremony felt ritualistic -- nostalgic, even -- with viewers primed for the grand theatricality of it all. You could imagine the spirit of John Cage, Mr. Cunningham's longtime partner, hovering gleefully over the proceedings. 
 Mr. Cunningham's methods have not always seemed so cuddly. Half a century ago his modern, experimental aesthetic, in which movement is meant to speak for itself, was more likely to provoke catcalls and cold shoulders from audiences, critics and choreographers ill-prepared to deal with his art and ideas. (The world is still grappling with the philosophies and possibilities presented by Mr. Cunningham, Mr. Cage and their peers.) Ms. Brown, an original and celebrated company member who stayed for 20 years, was there to witness it all. And now, finally, her memoir has arrived. It was only a decade more in the making than her tenure with Mr. Cunningham.
 Thankfully the book, ''Chance and Circumstance: Twenty Years With Cage and Cunningham,'' doesn't feel labored. Not even close. Ms. Brown has relied heavily on diary entries and letters written during her time with the company, and these vivid words anchor the book's rambling vitality. She rockets from the heady excitements of New York's burgeoning art scene in the 1950s to the fraught relationships between the modern ''Biggies'' (including Martha Graham, Jose Limon and Doris Humphrey) at the American Dance Festival to tour descriptions that suggest she would make a fine travel writer, though one prone to moments of outrageous romanticism. (In India, during the company's 1964 world tour, she even inquires about adopting a ''curly-haired beggar child.'') 
 If Ms. Brown were interested only in offering detail-rich snapshots of the company's first two decades, her memoir would certainly be an entertaining read, as well as an invaluable resource for scholars. (This is particularly true with regard to Mr. Cunningham, about whom there is not a particularly extensive literature.) But she is far too feisty to produce an agenda-free historical document. As she writes in the preface, her memoir is just one telling of this story, and ''surely there are as many other versions as there were people involved -- plus that impossible, truly objective one.'' After this charmingly disingenuous disclaimer, she turns to setting the record straight. 
 Nowhere is she more fervent than in her feeling that Mr. Cunningham's work is often clumsily understood, aided by his own obfuscations. ''I'll state once again,'' she writes, ''as I intend to do throughout this book, that the meaning of and in Merce's dances was never merely the steps, and that even if he and John Cage intended them to be (and I am convinced Merce did not), it's impossible for human bodies placed together in time and space not to reek with secret and not-so-secret meaning.''
 Later she describes telling Mr. Cunningham, waiting in the wings before a performance, that she had lost the ''quality'' of ''Scramble,'' so long had it been since they danced it. He responded, ''There is no quality to lose.'' Thirty years later she tartly counters, ''Well, I beg to differ.''
 Her physical knowledge of Mr. Cunningham's work gives her assertions a distinct authority, and her descriptions of the choreography are fascinating. The same cannot be said for everything here; once in awhile -- say, after the umpteenth description of lost luggage, inadequate theaters and turista traumas -- you wish for a bit more economy of detail. But how to decide what should go? Most pages contain absolute gems, like this description of a 1965 performance in New York, excerpted from Ms. Brown's journal:
 ''State Theater programs were an absolute gas! That is, I had a glorious time!!! God, what intoxication it is to perform in a theater like that. The space is so marvelously HUGE, it makes me giddy with delight.''
 ''When it was over,'' she continues, ''and we took curtain calls, I felt like some member of a tiny minority group that the whole world hated and was booing we ran on stage -- the six of us -- as though electrified with strength, defiance, courage, and belief in what we were doing and the people shrieked, booed and hissed. And other people cheered and bravoed.'' 
 Ms. Brown's romantic relationships are documented, including her marriage to the composer Earle Brown, but the true love story here is an artistic one. She fell early and hard for Mr. Cunningham's choreography, for the vigor of Mr. Rauschenberg's riotously creative contributions and for the holistic art-and-life philosophy embodied most fully by Mr. Cage. Like any true love affair between complex, often difficult people, it produced deeply felt, wildly varying emotions. No matter the length, a book can offer only glimpses of such relationships. But what glimpses.

 Irish Furniture, Gutsy and Ebullient, In a Book and a Sale 
 Christie's sale of English furniture on Monday in New York includes some 18th-century Irish antiques, each carefully notated in the catalog with a typically Irish winged-harp symbol. The harp is helpful, because it can be difficult to identify 18th-century Irish antiques.
 Even experts become confused, but help is on the way. Yale University Press has just published ''Irish Furniture,'' by Desmond FitzGerald, an expert in Irish antiques, and James Peill, a furniture specialist at Christie's New York. The book has been in the works for more than 40 years.
''In the 1960s, when I was a curator at the Victoria and Albert, there was practically no Irish furniture there,'' Mr. FitzGerald said. ''It was not regarded as having any importance, but I started buying it for myself.'' 
 Mr. FitzGerald, the final holder of the hereditary Knight of Glin title, returned to his native Ireland to work as a representative for Christie's in the 1970s. ''I was like a funeral director at many important Irish sales,'' he said. ''In those days Ireland's grand houses were being dismantled.'' Now, he said, thanks to the Celtic Tiger (as Ireland's economic boom of the '90s is known), ''the tide has turned, and the houses are being bought back and refurbished.'' 
 Fascinated by Irish decorative arts, he collected more than 2,000 photos of Irish antiques, divided by furniture type. ''In time, we were able to identify schools of carvers in Dublin and what houses commissioned what pieces,'' he said. He began writing a book. 
 ''He started working on it before I was born,'' said Mr. Peill, 35, who met Mr. FitzGerald when he joined Christie's in 1994.
 While it is always dangerous to generalize, Irish furniture tends to be gutsy, bold and distinctive. 
 ''There is an ebullience in Irish decorative arts -- the plasterwork, the silver, the bookbinding and furniture,'' Mr. FitzGerald said. ''Perhaps the result of a provincial feeling of superseding the mother country, England.''
 Humphrey Wakefield, a collector and former director of Mallett, the English antiques shop in London, appreciates ''the exuberance'' of Irish furniture. ''You get English, French, Dutch input, and the Irish spirit picks up that input and swirls it into its own cocktail,'' he said. ''Then there are the technical details and stylistic things that tell you something is Irish.''
 Most obvious are the motifs, whether human, animal, mythological or floral, that enliven Irish furniture. Imposing, deeply carved, over-scaled lions' heads and eagles, goblins, snakes, scallop shells and baskets of flowers abound.
 ''The whole atmosphere in Ireland is gentle, misty and depressive,'' Mr. Wakefield said. ''Therefore they have to have furniture that almost explodes. Then it's wonderful and worth having.'' 
 The lion masks are particularly ferocious. ''The furniture has an animalistic nature,'' Mr. Peill said. ''It tends to be slightly cruder than its more refined English counterparts, but you do get an amazing display of carving.''
 Carved foliage tends to be tamer. It is often seen on the apron of a table in low relief against a background incised with tiny dots. ''This trellis etching on the background, known as diapering, is a particularly Irish feature,'' Mr. Peill said. ''So is flatness of carving.''
 Lot 120, a George III mahogany side table from about 1760, is probably the most typically Irish piece in the Christie's sale. (The presale view continues through Sunday.) It has a plain frieze below its rectangular mahogany top. Below it is a carved apron bursting with scallop shells, flowers and acanthus leaves. The knees of the cabriole legs have flowing acanthus leaves, and the feet are squared and pawed. The estimate is $50,000 to $80,000.
 Desmond Guinness, the founder of the Irish Georgian Society and author of several books on Irish houses, said that only in Ireland do you find the squared-off hairy-paw foot. ''A bulging hock above the foot is another Irish characteristic,'' he added. Other clues? Carved tassels on chair backs, elongated shells, chair arms terminating in eagles' heads and oak-leaf festoons.
 Buzzy O'Keeffe, the owner of the Water Club and the River Cafe in New York, has collected Irish antiques for 25 years, including furniture, mirrors and silver. He shops at Manhattan galleries that specialize in American antiques, like O'Sullivan Antiques and Ann Morris, and attends auctions at Christie's, Sotheby's and Doyle New York. He said he does not shop much in Dublin anymore. 
 ''These days Irish antiques are more expensive in Ireland than they are in the United States,'' he said. ''Of course, I made things hard for myself by collecting only Irish Georgian.''
 In the 1960s and '70s, Irish dealers sent shiploads of Irish furniture to America, when times were hard in Ireland.
 Chantal O'Sullivan, a dealer with Irish antiques shops in New York and Dublin, said she has a few Irish tables for sale in New York. ''The tables I used to sell in America are going back to Ireland, where the market is very strong now,'' she said. ''Irish furniture is more in demand than English furniture because it's rarer, so the prices are becoming stronger.''
 The market for Irish furniture has changed a lot in the last decade.
 ''Irish furniture used to be regarded as ugly in Ireland,'' Mr. Wakefield said. ''And even when Irish furniture went to America, it was never as expensive as American antiques. Until recently you could add two zeroes to the price of an 18th-century American piece that looked just like an Irish one.''
 Clever shoppers may be able to locate Irish antiques at the five-day Spring 2007 International Art & Antiques Show, opening today at the Seventh Regiment Armory at 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street. The vigilant should also be on the lookout for American antiques made by the many Irish craftsmen who immigrated to Philadelphia, Boston and Charleston, S.C., in the 17th and 18th centuries.
 There was also a lot of Irish influence on the Colonial cabinetmakers of the Rappahannock River Basin in Virginia. One scholar, Ronald L. Hurst, wrote in the 1997 Chipstone publication, American Furniture, that some of these cabinetmakers must have been either of Irish origin or had seen Irish furniture because their furniture carries so many distinctive Irish traits.
 Ralph Harvard, a New York architect and interior designer, is an expert on Southern furniture. Asked his opinion of Rappahannock River Basin Irish antiques, he said, ''They may not be beautiful, but they are definitely ambitious.''

HEADLINE: Gilded Once More

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
One of the distinctive features of the modern American right has been nostalgia for the late 19th century, with its minimal taxation, absence of regulation and reliance on faith-based charity rather than government social programs. Conservatives from Milton Friedman to Grover Norquist have portrayed the Gilded Age as a golden age, dismissing talk of the era's injustice and cruelty as a left-wing myth.
 Well, in at least one respect, everything old is new again. Income inequality -- which began rising at the same time that modern conservatism began gaining political power -- is now fully back to Gilded Age levels. 
Consider a head-to-head comparison. We know what John D. Rockefeller, the richest man in Gilded Age America, made in 1894, because in 1895 he had to pay income taxes. (The next year, the Supreme Court declared the income tax unconstitutional.) His return declared an income of $1.25 million, almost 7,000 times the average per capita income in the United States at the time.
 But that makes him a mere piker by modern standards. Last year, according to Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine, James Simons, a hedge fund manager, took home $1.7 billion, more than 38,000 times the average income. Two other hedge fund managers also made more than $1 billion, and the top 25 combined made $14 billion. 
 How much is $14 billion? It's more than it would cost to provide health care for a year to eight million children -- the number of children in America who, unlike children in any other advanced country, don't have health insurance. 
 The hedge fund billionaires are simply extreme examples of a much bigger phenomenon: every available measure of income concentration shows that we've gone back to levels of inequality not seen since the 1920s.
 The New Gilded Age doesn't feel quite as harsh and unjust as the old Gilded Age -- not yet, anyway. But that's because the effects of inequality are still moderated by progressive income taxes, which fall more heavily on the rich than on the middle class; by estate taxation, which limits the inheritance of great wealth; and by social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which provide a safety net for the less fortunate.
 You might have thought that in the face of growing inequality, there would have been a move to reinforce these moderating institutions -- to raise taxes on the rich and use the money to strengthen the safety net. That's why comparing the incomes of hedge fund managers with the cost of children's health care isn't an idle exercise: there's a real trade-off involved. But for the past three decades, such trade-offs have been consistently settled in favor of the haves and have-mores.
 Taxation has become much less progressive: according to estimates by the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, average tax rates on the richest 0.01 percent of Americans have been cut in half since 1970, while taxes on the middle class have risen. In particular, the unearned income of the wealthy -- dividends and capital gains -- is now taxed at a lower rate than the earned income of most middle-class families. 
 Those hedge fund titans, by the way, have an especially sweet deal: loopholes in the law let them use their own businesses as, in effect, unlimited 401(k)s, sheltering their earnings and accumulating tax-free capital gains.
 Meanwhile, the tax-cut bill Congress passed in 2001 set in motion a complete phaseout of the estate tax. If the Bush administration hadn't been too clever by half, hiding the true cost of its tax cuts by making the whole package expire at the end of 2010, we'd be well on our way toward becoming a dynastic society.
 And as for the social insurance programs ---- well, in 2005 the Bush administration tried to privatize Social Security. If it had succeeded, Medicare would have been next.
 Of course, the administration's attempt to undo Social Security was a notable failure. The public, it seems, isn't eager to return to the days before the New Deal. And the G.O.P.'s defeat in the midterm election has put on hold other plans to restore the good old days.
 But it's much too soon to declare the march toward a New Gilded Age over. If history is any guide, one of these days we'll see the emergence of a New Progressive Era, maybe even a New New Deal. But it may be a long wait.

HEADLINE: Public Says Warming Is a Problem, but Remains Split on Response

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Marina Stefan and Megan Thee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Americans in large bipartisan numbers say the heating of the earth's atmosphere is having serious effects on the environment now or will soon and think that it is necessary to take immediate steps to reduce its effects, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll finds.
 Ninety percent of Democrats, 80 percent of independents and 60 percent of Republicans said immediate action was required to curb the warming of the atmosphere and deal with its effects on the global climate. Nineteen percent said it was not necessary to act now, and 1 percent said no steps were needed.
 Recent international reports have said with near certainty that human activities are the main cause of global warming since 1950. The poll found that 84 percent of Americans see human activity as at least contributing to warming.
 The poll also found that Americans want the United States to support conservation and to be a global leader in addressing environmental problems and developing alternative energy sources to reduce reliance on fossil fuels like oil and coal. 
 The presidential candidates have recognized the desire for swifter action on energy and the environment than the Bush administration has pursued and have offered plans with varying degrees of specificity.
 Among the leading Democrats, John Edwards and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York have offered fairly detailed plans for national and international programs to reduce heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide and encouraging alternative energy sources.
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has been critical of the administration's responses and has advocated building nuclear plants to provide electricity.
 The issue arises frequently in public forums, and it is likely that along with the Iraq war and health care, it will be among the chief topics in the 2008 campaign.
 When it comes to specific steps to foster conservation or produce more energy, the public is deeply torn, the poll found. Respondents said they would support higher gasoline prices to reduce dependence on foreign oil but would oppose higher prices to combat global warming. 
 By large margins, respondents opposed an increase in pump prices of $2 a gallon, or even $1, to deal with environmental and energy-supply concerns. Three-quarters said they would be willing to pay more for electricity generated by renewable sources like solar or wind energy.
 The negative view of new gasoline taxes may reflect the wide expectation that pump prices will continue to increase regardless of government action. More than 80 percent foresee higher prices in coming months, with many citing the Iraq war as a primary cause. Most respondents said they did not expect that any withdrawal of American troops from Iraq would cause prices to fall.
 Nearly half of those polled also said they did not believe that their fellow Americans would be willing to change driving habits to save gasoline or reduce the production of heat-trapping gases, which most scientists say contribute to the warming. 
 Respondents expressed little confidence in President Bush's handling of environmental or energy issues, and a majority of those polled, including many Republicans, said Democrats were more likely than Republicans to protect the environment and foster energy independence. 
 One-third approved Mr. Bush's handling of the environment and 27 percent approved his approach to energy questions. Democrats have criticized Mr. Bush's policies on energy and the environment almost from the day he took office. Those policies have also cost him some Republican support, the poll showed.
 ''I think the Republicans have slashed the funds for cleanup of the environment, and if it comes down to whether or not it will cost big business, forget about the cleanup,'' said Ron Gellerman, 65, a respondent from Maple Grove, Minn., who said he was a Republican.
 ''The Democrats are more willing to spend dollars on pure research,'' Mr. Gellerman added in a follow-up interview after the poll was completed. ''They're open to alternative sources of energy, like wind. We could save more energy by increasing the efficiency of our electrical system and our automobiles. And the Democrats would be more willing to look at that sort of thing because they're not so beholden to Big Oil.''
 Many governors, members of Congress and presidential hopefuls from both parties have been more outspoken than Mr. Bush on the need to take immediate steps to combat global warming and reduce oil imports. 
 Private citizens tend to agree with them, the poll found, but they are also somewhat bewildered about the issues. Asked whether discussions of energy and the environment by political leaders were helpful or confusing, nearly three-quarters said the details were confusing.
 Asked how they would respond to a presidential candidate who said all Americans would have to pay more for fuel or use less of it to protect the environment, one-third said they would be more likely to vote for that person and 15 percent said they would be less likely. Almost half said it would make no difference.
 Americans broadly support using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power and say fueling vehicles with ethanol, which is now made largely from corn, is a good idea, the survey found. 
 They also are nearly evenly split on building nuclear power plants to reduce reliance on imported energy sources. When asked whether they would accept a nuclear plan in their community, they said no, 59 percent to 36 percent. 
 The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Friday to Tuesday with 1,052 adults. The margin-of-sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
 Nearly four of five of those polled said they believed that the condition of the air, water, land and wildlife around the world was fair or poor. One percent rated global environmental quality as excellent, and 19 percent called it good. But 56 percent said the environmental condition in their communities was excellent or good.
 Despite general optimism about their children's future found in other surveys, respondents in this poll said by 57 percent to 11 percent that the condition of the environment would be worse for the next generation.
 Fifty-two percent said that generally speaking they would support protecting the environment over stimulating the economy. Thirty-six percent chose the economy. But respondents also said, 62 percent to 21 percent, that developing new energy sources was more important than protecting the environment. 
 Yet they also expressed the belief that the government should encourage conservation over increasing development of additional energy sources. By a substantial margin, Americans continue to oppose drilling for oil and natural gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, as they have for the last six years.
 Although respondents split almost evenly on whether Washington can effectively address global warming, they almost unanimously (92 percent to 6 percent) supported requiring automobile manufacturers to make more fuel-efficient cars.
 There is more opposition to using fossil fuels among Democrats than Republicans. Fifty-four percent of Democrats consider using coal to generate electricity to be a bad idea, compared with 39 percent of Republicans. Sixty-one percent of Republicans favor using natural gas to generate power, while Democrats divided, with 42 percent saying it is a good idea and 45 percent opposing it.
 Americans almost universally support developing alternative energy sources like wind or solar power and biofuels, with 87 percent expressing approval. But fewer than 10 percent of those polled said they used any alternative energy source at home. 
 A big majority, 75 percent, said recent weather had been stranger than usual, an increase of almost 10 percentage points from 1997. Of those who said the weather had turned weird, 43 percent attributed it to global warming and 15 percent to pollution or other environmental damage. Four percent cited the coming end of the world or biblical prophecy, and 2 percent blamed space junk.
 Ten years ago, 5 percent of respondents blamed global warming for changes in the weather. How the Poll Was Conducted 
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted April 20 through April 24 with 1,052 adults throughout the United States. 
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population.
 Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, marital status, age and education.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. Shifts in results between polls over time also have a larger sampling error. 
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's Budget Includes Tax Cuts and a Record Surplus

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed a $59 billion budget yesterday that maintains tax cuts he promised earlier this year and includes a record-setting $4.4 billion surplus carried over from this year that he says will be used to help cover revenue shortfalls expected in 2009 and 2010.
 The surplus, the city's fourth straight one, was fueled by tax revenues that were $1.3 billion higher than the mayor's office projected in January, a reflection of a robust real estate market that continues to defy national trends and a spike in Wall Street profits in the last quarter of 2006.
But as the mayor warned that the city's good fortunes would not last, grumbling could already be heard among some City Council members and union leaders who said that he should dip into that surplus to finance other initiatives and increase pay for police officers. 
 Requests the City Council had made for inclusion in the budget that Mayor Bloomberg omitted included a $300 tax credit for renters and a proposal that would have increased spending to have all public libraries return to being open at least six days a week, a service that was lost in cuts after 9/11. 
 But the mayor did propose plenty of new spending measures, including $199 million for his 25-year PlaNYC blueprint to make the city more environmentally friendly, $28 million for 9/11 health programs and $1.4 million to hire 32 more fire marshals to investigate arson cases. 
 In a news conference yesterday, the mayor said he remained open to other proposals for the budget, which outlines spending for the 2008 fiscal year that begins this July 1. But signaling that the Council should lower its expectations, he pointed to projected budget shortfalls totaling $9.3 billion dollars in fiscal years 2009 through 2011.
 The mayor was also mindful of his first two years in office, when, faced with the city's worst fiscal crisis since the 1970s, he was forced to raise taxes and slash spending. 
 ''The surest ways to reverse all the progress we've made over the last five years is to fall victim to complacency and political expediency,'' he said. ''We're not going to take that path. Instead, we're going to stick to the formula which fueled New York City's remarkable recovery and created our current prosperity.''
 That caution and the mayor's emphasis on long-range debt reduction was praised by fiscal watchdog groups. 
 ''It's really extraordinary how well the city is doing economically and continues to do,'' said Elisabeth Lynam, deputy research director for the business-financed Citizens Budget Commission. ''And that has importantly shifted the emphasis from the short-run budget cycle to the long-run planning horizon.'' 
 The city's comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., a potential 2009 mayoral candidate and a frequent critic of the mayor's on education issues, also praised the budget plan. 
 ''In times of prosperity, we must take steps so that we do not have to return to New Yorkers to ask them to dip into their pockets when times are bad,'' Mr. Thompson said in a statement. ''The budget is fiscal integrity at its best, and displays a continuous commitment toward achieving fiscal stability.''
 But the absence of some of those Council priorities in Mr. Bloomberg's budget will probably make this year's budget negotiations more contentious than expected, despite the close working relationship that the mayor and Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn have developed over the last two years. 
 The mayor and Council have until June 30 to agree on a final budget.
 Mr. Bloomberg's plan did include some Council proposals, like adding $13 million to the baseline budget for the district attorney's offices and another $5 million for the prosecution of child abuse cases. 
 It also increases spending to buy land in the Catskill-Delaware watershed, which provides 90 percent of the city's drinking water, to $320 million over 10 years, from the $52 million he proposed in January. 
 In addition, Mr. Bloomberg financed Ms. Quinn's proposal to create 10 new health clinics for underserved communities. 
 ''Mayor Bloomberg has prudently offered both tax breaks and new programs while keeping spending in check and saving for the future,'' Ms. Quinn said in a statement. ''We look forward to reviewing this budget in further detail and to productive discussions with the Bloomberg administration over the coming weeks to achieve a fiscally responsible budget that serves New Yorkers and protects core city services.'' 
 Among new spending in the mayor's plan is $50 million to start a new financing authority, which will require Albany's approval, to support major infrastructure projects. It also includes $25 million to start a fund to reclaim unused contaminated land in the city; $81 million to make city-owned buildings more energy efficient; and $8.2 million to construct a bicycle path network. 
 All four initiatives were outlined in his PlaNYC proposal, which is intended to make New York more environmentally friendly and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as the city adds an estimated 1 million new residents by the year 2030. 
 Other highlights include $3.3 million for bullet-resistant vests to auxiliary police officers; two auxiliary officers were fatally shot last month. The spending plan also includes $5.4 million to increase ferry security. 
 The budget maintains $1 billion in tax cuts the mayor promised in January, including $750 million in one-time property tax relief. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's capital plan includes more than $83 billion in infrastructure projects and improvements, including $42 million for new soccer fields, $387 million for eight regional parks and $28.2 billion for school construction. 
 The plan also includes $1 billion to build a new police academy, as previously announced. 
 Since the mayor's initial budget proposal in January, the city lost some $308 million in expected state aid and also called for all its agencies to cut back on spending. The agency cuts created $700 million in savings. 
 City Councilman David I. Weprin, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, said that in light of the whopping budget surplus, those cuts needed to be looked at more closely. 
 ''In the days ahead, we are going to review the mayor's executive budget and make sure that none of these cuts affects essential city services,'' Mr. Weprin said. 
 The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which has been locked in labor negotiations for months, urged the mayor to use the surplus to make police salaries more competitive. 
 ''There is no better time to adjust our police salary to market rate than now,'' the union's president, Patrick J. Lynch said, adding that one reason the city was so prosperous now is because of crime reduction. 
 The mayor responded that the city had offered substantial raises to the union, which rejected them. 
 Despite some Council priorities that were left out of the budget, the mayor said he expected the budget to be completed on time. 
 ''The City Council has a good staff and Christine Quinn is a tough negotiator, but she's willing to sit down at the table and look me in the eye and negotiate,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. '' I don't see why we won't come up with a budget that will let everybody have something, but nobody's going to get everything they want, us or them.''

HEADLINE: In Men's and Women's Apparel, All Tariffs Aren't Created Equal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Congress, it turns out, plays fashion favorites. 
 Take bathing suits. It slaps a 28 percent tax on men's imports, but just 12 percent on women's.
Or overalls. The government imposes a 14 percent tariff on women's, but only 9 percent on men's. 
 Woven wool shirts? Men's are hit with an 18 percent duty, more than twice as much as women's. 
 There is no apparent pattern to the tariffs, which penalize men in some instances, and women in others. But the fees tacked onto clothing, shoes and swimwear as they enter the country's ports may be the last legal form of sex discrimination in the United States, approved year after year by lawmakers and passed on to consumers.
 For decades, apparel companies have grudgingly tolerated the peculiar disparities, writing them off as a vestige of smoke-filled, backroom trade negotiations. 
 But now, several major apparel makers, like Steve Madden, Asics and Columbia Sportswear, are challenging the tariffs in lawsuits against the federal government that have broad implications for the clothing industry, not to mention the battle of the sexes.
 If the clothing companies prevail, they could reclaim close to $1 billion worth of tariffs based on gender differences. For example, the lawsuit claims that the government earned $2.5 million last year from discriminatory tariffs on underpants (penalizing women), $93 million for cotton shirts (penalizing men), $16 million for silk shirts (penalizing women) and $71 million for shoes with leather tops (women again). 
 The case also could help unravel one of the greatest mysteries in retailing: why similar clothing for men and women is priced so differently.
 What the lawyers do not know -- and what they hope their lawsuit reveals -- is precisely why these glaring disparities exist. 
 Theories abound. Since the first appearance of gender differences in the tariff system dates back to the mid-1800s, plain old sexism is one hypothesis. An effort to protect American textile manufacturers from imports is another. 
 But after years of poring over dusty tariff lists, international trade court records and Congressional testimony, lawyers have found nothing that explains why, say, the tariff on an imported wool suit is 8.5 percent for a woman and zero for a man.
 ''It's irrational,'' said Peter Bragdon, the general counsel at Columbia Sportswear, one of the companies suing the government. 
 Columbia Sportswear imports a rugged hiking boot from China called the Diamond Peak. The men's and women's boots are virtually identical. But the tariff on the women's version is 1.5 percentage points higher than the men's (10 percent, compared with 8.5 percent). 
 ''I think any first-year law student would have the same gut reaction we did -- wait, you cannot do that,'' Mr. Bragdon said.
 The government's only known opinion on the matter appeared in 1960, during a study of the United States tariff system -- and it appears to help the clothing companies' legal case, rather than hurt it. 
 Describing the gender disparities on shoes, federal regulators conceded that ''their economic justification is questionable.''
 Today, few in the government want to discuss the issue. Spokesmen for the Office of the United States Trade Representative and the Justice Department said they would not comment on the role of gender in determining tariffs because of the pending lawsuit. 
 The existence of different tariffs for men and women, imposed on similar clothing, would most likely have remained out of public view if not for a Manhattan lawyer named Michael T. Cone, who has spent nearly a decade researching the topic. 
 After all, thousands of clothing companies, fully aware of the disparities, have accepted it as a fact of life. ''You grin and bear it,'' said Alan Geller, president of Teri Jon Apparel, which makes women's suits (with a higher tariff rate than for men's) for Saks, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale's.
 But Mr. Cone, from the firm Neville Peterson, found the differences ''offensive'' and likened them to a federal sales tax based on gender. ''Who would stand for that? If you were to buy a shirt and it was 5 percent more only because you are a man or a woman you would be outraged -- and people should be equally outraged at what is happening with tariffs.''
 His lawsuit, filed on behalf of Totes-Isotoner, the glove maker, asserts that different tariff rates for similar men's and women's clothing violate the Constitution's guarantee of due process and equal protection. (The tariff on seamed leather gloves, a top seller for Totes-Isotoner, is 14 percent for men's and 12.6 percent for women's.)
 After years of resistance -- no major apparel brand wants to sue the government if it can avoid it -- several companies have come around to Mr. Cone's opinion. 
 The prospect of a big payoff does not hurt either. Lawyers and apparel companies stand to win tens of millions in refunded tariffs -- not to mention future profits from lower tariffs, which they hope to secure in a settlement with the government. 
 There is a chance, however slim, that the case could backfire if the government chooses to eliminate sex differences by raising the lower tariffs, rather than reducing the higher ones. 
 Clothing executives said they had consumers' interests in mind, too. Tariffs based on gender, they said, discourage them from making dozens of products with the higher tariffs for either men and women, limiting shoppers' options. 
 ''You have to work around them,'' said Bob Africa, director of footwear at Pearl Izumi, which makes athletic clothing. 
 The current system leaves apparel makers with few enviable options, executives said. They can stop making a product with a higher tariff, charge more for it or make less money on it.
 Pearl Izumi, for example, makes a cycling sneaker in China called the Vagabond for men and women, charging $85 for both. But the company pays a tariff of 4.3 percent for the men's version, and zero for women. As a result, it makes less money on every Vagabond sold to a man. 
 Mr. Africa says he is baffled by the differences: ''I see no logical reason for it. It simply does not add up.''

HEADLINE: The Dow May Be at Its High, but Its Performance Is Still Lacking

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
THE Dow Jones industrial average rose above 13,000 this week, well above the highest point it reached in 2000 before the technology stock bubble burst and the country went into a recession in 2001.
 At the same time, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which is the Dow's principal competition for most prominent index in the United States, has not yet made it back to its lofty 2000 peak.
But does that mean the stocks in the Dow have done better than those in the S.& P. index since the market peaked in 2000? Actually not. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, only half of the stocks in the Dow are higher than they were back then, while the number of rising stocks in the S.& P. is triple the number of losers. 
 At issue is how indexes are calculated. There are at least three ways that major indexes are calculated, and the choice of one or the other can make a big difference. 
 The Dow is normally calculated as a price-weighted index, meaning that stocks with the highest price for a share get the heaviest weighting. That is largely a historical accident, as it was the easiest way to do it in the 19th century, when the best calculator available was a person with a pencil.
 The most common method of calculating indexes is by market capitalization, in which the companies with the largest market value count for the most. The chart shows how the Dow would look if it were calculated in that manner, instead of the other.
 While the Dow is up 18 percent from March 24, 2000, when the S.& P. peaked, it would have been down 8 percent had market capitalizations been used in the computation. That reflects the fact that some of the Dow stocks that did the worst, including General Electric, Microsoft, Intel and Pfizer, are large capitalization stocks that had relatively low share prices. That meant they had little impact on the Dow as normally calculated, but a large effect on the Dow as computed using capitalization figures.
 The third method often used in index calculations is one of equal weighting, which assumes that one puts the same dollar value into each stock in the index. 
 The chart shows that the S.& P. 500, calculated by market capitalization, is still 2 percent below where it was on March 24, 2000. But that reflects poor performances by some of the same very large companies that starred before 2000 and have not done as well since. Calculated by equal-weighting, the S.& P. 500 is 82 percent higher than it was in 2000.
 In every year from 1994 to 1999, the equal-weighted index did worse than the normal S.& P. In every year since, it has done better. So far in 2007, that pattern has continued, with the equal-weighted index up 7 percent, and the normal S.& P. up 5 percent.
 There is no price-weighted version of the S.& P. available, nor is there an equal-weighted version of the Dow. But using the market capitalization versions, it is clear the Dow has underperformed, even if it is the Dow that is the index setting records these days.
 And investors with an international perspective may note that the United States dollar is not what it used to be. At the peak of the stock market in 2000, a euro was worth less than a dollar. Now a euro is worth more than $1.35. 
 Measured in euros, the price-weighted Dow is still 15 percent lower than it was in March 2000. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A chart with the Off the Charts column in Business Day on Saturday misstated the performance of Merck stock from March 24, 2000, to April 27, 2007. It fell 11.3 percent; it did not rise 37.5 percent.

GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Who's Up and Who's Not'' The Dow Jones industrial average exceeded 13,000 for the first time this week, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index remained below its 2000 high. But most of the stocks in the Dow industrials are lower than they were in 2000, while most of the stocks in the S.& P. 500 are higher. How averages are computed can make a big difference. All data show percentage change from March 24, 2000, when the S.& P. 500 peaked, to Friday. Each chart shows two ways of computing the indexes. The 30 Dow industrials stocks Altria: +368.1% Caterpillar: +269.6 Boeing: +161.8 United Technologies: +137.1 Procter & Gamble: +124.9 Exxon Mobil: +108.1 Johnson & Johnson: +77.6 3M: +77.1 McDonald's: +41.4 Merck: +37.5 American Express: +36.8 Citigroup: +26.3 Coca-Cola: +10.8 Honeywell: +8.2 Alcoa: +0.1 American Intl.

HEADLINE: Jailed 7 Years for Contempt, Adviser Is Headed for Prison

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
A federal judge lifted a seven-year-old civil contempt sanction on the financial adviser Martin A. Armstrong yesterday, allowing him to begin serving a five-year sentence for conspiracy to commit fraud.
 The decision by Judge P. Kevin Castel of Federal District Court in Manhattan ends one of the longest-running cases of civil contempt in American legal history. It will finally pry Mr. Armstrong, 57, from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, where he has been held since January 2000.
 ''The incarceration for contempt is over,'' Mr. Armstrong's lawyer, Thomas V. Sjoblom, said after the hearing. 
 All told, by the time Mr. Armstrong is released, he will have served 12 years for orchestrating what prosecutors called a $3 billion Ponzi scheme through his investment fund, Princeton Economics International. 
 ''Those who believe you are innocent or a victim are the latest victims of Mr. Armstrong's fraud,'' Judge Castel said yesterday. ''They haven't done their homework.''
 Judge Castel left in place the finding that Mr. Armstrong was in contempt but decided that keeping him in jail on that claim had no effect.
 ''If seven years didn't do it, another two, another three, another five years isn't going to do it either,'' Mr. Sjoblom said.
 Prosecutors may now pursue a criminal contempt sanction against Mr. Armstrong because of his failure to turn over the assets. Mr. Sjoblom said he did not expect that to happen.
 The contempt charge stems from both criminal and civil suits filed by the government against Mr. Armstrong in 1999. In 2000, the court-appointed receiver in the civil case demanded the return of various assets, including gold coins and a bust of Julius Caesar, which may have been purchased with money from Mr. Armstrong's investment fund. 
 When Mr. Armstrong did not produce the assets, as well as documents that were requested by the government, the judge in the case, Richard Owen, ordered him jailed.
 Jail terms for civil contempt, unlike those for criminal contempt, are aimed at coercing offenders into cooperating and are not meant as punishment. In most such cases, a person is held for contempt for 18 months at most. 
 But Judge Owen repeatedly reimposed the jail time, demanding the production of the materials. He was removed from the case by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in November after justices decided the case needed ''a fresh look by a different pair of eyes.''
 Last summer, after spending several days in solitary confinement, Mr. Armstrong reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy in the criminal case, which centered on what prosecutors said was a plan from 1992 to 1999 to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses.
 Earlier this month, Mr. Armstrong was sentenced to five years in prison, concluding the government's separate criminal case against him. But in ruling that the civil and criminal matters were separate, the judge in the criminal case chose not to credit Mr. Armstrong with the time already served. 
 Thus, that sentence would not be carried out until the civil contempt case was resolved.
 The Bureau of Prisons will now decide where and when Mr. Armstrong will be assigned for his criminal sentence. He has requested to be sent to Fort Dix, a low-security prison in New Jersey close to his mother. 
 Yesterday's hearing proved contentious from the start. Judge Castel sparred with Mr. Armstrong's lawyers, scolding them for introducing evidence at the last minute.
 At one point, Judge Castel argued with Mr. Sjoblom over the defense's attempt to introduce as evidence statements from several individuals. Judge Castel harangued Mr. Sjoblom over the finer points of legal discovery, including the difference between sworn statements and depositions, which allow for cross-examination.
 After the hearing, Mr. Sjoblom and Tancred V. Schiavoni, a lawyer working for the court-appointed receiver, traded verbal jabs as well. 
 ''You could have gotten your client out of jail seven years ago, but you blew it,'' Mr. Schiavoni told Mr. Sjoblom.

HEADLINE: Rolling Homes Aren't Just for the Rich

BYLINE: By JUSTON JONES

 BODY:
Recreational vehicles are not just toys for the rich, says Bruce D. Hertzke, 55, chairman and chief executive of Winnebago Industries, a big maker of R.V.'s and motor homes. Blue-collar workers, who have saved for retirement and travel make up a big chunk of the company's business. Mr. Hertzke spoke recently about those customers, about feeling the pain of high gas prices and about how some people save the fancy trimmings for their R.V. instead of their house. 
Following are excerpts: Q. What is your biggest month for sales? A. Actually, it's more so the whole season, not a single month. The spring and summer periods have always been our strongest. From April to July are our biggest months of selling to the wholesale dealers. The summer shutdown of schools, when people are planning their vacations, are when most of the sales occur. Q. So does that translate to those periods being your strongest quarters for profits? A. Yes. In our fiscal year, those months fall in our third and fourth quarters, and they are our strongest. Q. Do you know the profile of your typical customer? A. It is someone 55 to 70 years of age, who has been in retirement mode, or who is looking for an R.V. for leisure travel, or wants one to help with pursuing another hobby -- like following the Nascar circuit or tailgating at a favorite football team on weekends. R.V.'s are no longer just for camping.
Even after 70, we have a lot of people who continue to use R.V.'s. And we even have people as young as 35, who want to use them to tailgate, or for supporting other hobbies. Q. Do some Winnebago owners live in R.V.'s year-round? A. Yes. In fact, our company has a 365 Club for customers who use their Winnebagos as their full-time home. Q. What is the average price of a Winnebago? A. Around $90,000 to $100,000. We have some that go up to $300,000 or more, and some that start at $60,000. Q. Is an R.V. basically a toy for rich people? A. No, we have a lot of blue-collar workers who are our customers, who have worked hard, saved their money and are ready to retire and do some traveling. It makes it a lot easier for them to buy a motor home and take food and other essentials with them instead of going to a resort. 
 Another thing that helps this customer, for a person to buy a motor home, one can actually qualify for a second home loan. They can use the loan for an R.V. instead of using it to buy a condo in Florida or somewhere. A lot of people want to see more of America this way. Q. Your sales and net income have been falling over the past few years. How do you expect to get them to start growing again? A. If you look at the results of our last eight years, there was steady growth until reaching record revenues and profits in 2004. Since then, gas prices shot up, there were 17 interest-rate hikes and consumer confidence dropped. We felt the brunt of that.
 But we believe that we have a growing market. In the United States, our estimates suggest that we have people turning 50 at a rate of 350,000 per month. That is more than four million per year, and this is our target market. With these favorable demographics -- it's baby boomers who buy our products -- we expect our sales and profits to return to a growth cycle. Q. When will that growth cycle begin? A. It's really retail-market dependent. Without knowing where the economy is headed, I'm unable to put a defined time frame on it. Q. You announced you will soon be paying a cash dividend, and your stock price is only a few dollars from a 52-week high. Why do you think investors are confident in the stock? A. Many of our investors have followed us over time. They understand that we are a cyclical industry. As much as I hate to say it, people don't have to buy a $100,000 R.V., not like milk and bread. People sometimes go into a wait-and-see mode. That hesitancy puts us into periods where things go flat for a while. Q. Have high gas prices affected your sales? A. Yes, and I don't know if it's just gas prices, or the drop in consumer confidence. It's a combination. Q. Detroit and Washington alike are concentrating on ways to reduce emissions. Is that an issue for your company, too? A. Winnebago is very pleased that we have developed a diesel motor home that gets 17 to 19 miles per gallon, one of the highest gas mileage R.V.'s in the industry. It has been a very successful product because of the fuel efficiency. That motor home gets better gas mileage than my Ford pickup. Q. What new features have you been adding to motor homes? A. You can get washers and dryers and dishwashers, ceramic floor tiles, security cameras outside your coach, Sony surround-sound systems for at least two TVs -- one in the bedroom in the back and one in the front -- computer hookups and DVD players. We make sure that nobody's roughing it too much.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Asia: China: A New Envoy To The United States

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
China named Yang Jiechi, who was ambassador to the United States from 2001 to 2005, to become foreign minister, shuffling its diplomatic team as its rising economic power has given it greater sway in world affairs. Mr. Yang, 56, formerly a vice minister, is fluent in English and well known for a courteous but cautious manner. He replaces Li Zhaoxing, another English speaker and former ambassador to Washington, who is 66. No reason was given for the replacement, but Mr. Li had passed the retirement age for ministerial officials. Mr. Yang assumes the helm at a time when China has greatly expanded its diplomatic activities around the world, especially in Asia and Africa, and as its economic growth and increased military spending have raised concerns in some quarters that it may begin to challenge Washington for leadership in world affairs.

HEADLINE: Far Past Time to Go

 BODY:
It is hard to figure out what Paul Wolfowitz is telling himself as he wages an unseemly fight to hang on to his job as head of the World Bank. 
 Any hope he had of reforming the bank has evaporated in the face of allegations of conflicts of interest and undeniably poor judgment. Any hope of expiating his sins for the disastrous Iraq war have also disappeared as once again he stubbornly denies reality and the damage that denial is causing to his reputation and to the bank's ability to do its work.
In the latest no-confidence clamor, some 40 members of the bank's anticorruption team warned that their ability to do their work, Mr. Wolfowitz's signature priority, ''is eroding in the face of legitimate questions from our clients about the bank's ability to practice what it preaches on governance.''
 In the past we have said that Mr. Wolfowitz deserved praise for championing debt relief for the world's poorest countries and that he was right in saying the bank needs to do a lot more to fight corruption, which can cripple any development effort. 
 Mr. Wolfowitz's claim that many at the bank blame him for his old job at the Pentagon is also true. But he has made things far worse -- with both the staff and the bank's shareholders -- by refusing to explain his decisions and surrounding himself with a tight group of former Bush administration officials who, true to their roots, have lashed out at anyone who dares to question their policies.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's battle to hang on is doing even more damage, roiling the staff, wasting top officials' energies and further alienating big donors. At a meeting with his top managers last week, Mr. Wolfowitz said he wanted to regain their trust. That is no longer possible. The best thing he can do for the bank, the country and himself is to step down.

HEADLINE: San Francisco Bay Area Reacts Angrily to Series of Immigration Raids

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 27 

 BODY:
It was not the typical Bay Area morning. Before dawn on March 6, dozens of federal immigration agents conducted surprise raids in San Rafael and nearby Novato, two comfortable Marin County suburbs where the idea of early morning excitement usually involves a trip to Starbucks.
 The raids are part of the government's Operation Return to Sender, in which more than 23,000 people have been arrested nationwide, including more than 1,800 in Northern and Central California, immigration officials said. 
 And while the raids have upset many pro-immigrant groups nationwide, that displeasure has been particularly acute in the Bay Area, a region that generally bends left politically and where many cities consider themselves so-called ''sanctuaries'' for illegal immigrants. 
 ''These people have been here many, many years and they have an investment in the community,'' said Mayor Al Boro of San Rafael, a city of about 56,000 residents, a quarter of whom are Latino. ''And we need to respect that.''
 Several city councils have passed resolutions expressing their anger about the raids, and local religious leaders have issued stern proclamations. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco, for example, said in late March that they were inhumane and called for their immediate end. The raids have also led to protests in several cities, with another round planned for Tuesday in the area's three largest cities: San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland.
 The raids have even upset people in more conservative regions to the east. In Mendota, an agricultural town in the Central Valley that calls itself the ''Cantaloupe Center of the World,'' the City Council passed a resolution last month condemning them. The raids, according to the resolution, had driven much-needed migrant workers underground and caused ''emotional turmoil and financial hardship.'' 
 In Richmond, another economically challenged city just east across the bay from San Francisco, Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, a member of the Green Party, wrote a bill restating an ordinance that prohibits city employees from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. It passed the City Council unanimously in February. 
 That sanctuary sentiment was also echoed on Sunday in a speech by Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, a Democrat, who repeated his city's noncooperative status, a move that drew a rebuke from a Republican lawmaker in Washington, Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado, who called the mayor's actions ''a clear and direct violation of the law.'' 
 The anti-raid sentiments have also energized some opponents of immigration. A recent protest in San Rafael was also attended by nearly 100 members of anti-immigrant groups, including members of the Northern California chapter of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, a group that advocates stronger borders.
 Much of the debate has been focused in San Rafael, a genial bayside commuter city about 20 miles north of San Francisco. Shortly after the raids, Mr. Boro sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, saying they had ''left our city in turmoil,'' with residents now distrustful of the police and children fearful of losing their parents.
 ''Waking people up in the dark of night, at 5 a.m., in their homes seems more like a scare tactic than a law enforcement necessity,'' Mr. Boro wrote. 
 Calls to the local police have decreased in recent weeks, Mr. Boro said, and he attributed the dropoff to the immigration raids' ''chilling effect because people think our police were involved.'' 
 Educators in San Rafael said the raids sent schools into ''a state of emergency'' as American-born children were suddenly without one or both parents who had been caught up in the sweeps. Shortly afterward, absenteeism at school spiked, and school officials asked teachers and others to ride buses with students to make sure a caregiver picked them up. 
 A school board member, Jenny Callaway, said she feared that test scores of anxiety-ridden students would suffer. ''Our charge is to provide a quality education regardless of citizenship,'' Ms. Callaway said. ''How do we do this when children are afraid to come to the bus stop?''
 One student caught up in the raids was 7-year-old Kebin Reyes, who was with his father, Noe, when he was arrested early in the morning of March 6. Mr. Reyes, 37, a Guatemalan, said that after his arrest, he was not allowed to call relatives to come to pick up his son, and that they both were held all day in a locked room at the offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Francisco, an experience he says left his son traumatized. 
 ''Before the arrest, my son was very friendly and would speak to most anyone, very active,'' Mr. Reyes said, through a translator. ''Since the day of the arrest, Kebin has turned to be very reserved and quiet and not as open to speak to anyone.'' 
 On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of Kebin, who was born in the United States and is an American citizen, charging that federal authorities had violated his constitutional rights. Immigration officials would not comment on the specifics of the case, but said agents had acted appropriately. 
 ''When we encounter minors in the course of an enforcement action, we will not leave them unattended,'' said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the immigration agency. ''This young man was not arrested; he was transported along with this father to the I.C.E. office, where he was supervised until a family member came to get him.''
 Immigration agency officials say Mr. Reyes was ordered deported in 2000, the same year his son was born. He is fighting that order, and a hearing is scheduled in June. But there is no question, Mr. Reyes said, about his son's status.
 ''My son has the same rights as any American citizen,'' he said. ''He is born here in California.''

HEADLINE: Europe Worries as Russia and U.S. Argue Over Missiles

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and MARK LANDLER; Thom Shanker reported from Washington, and Mark Landler from Oslo.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
When the United States first asked Poland and the Czech Republic to base missile defenses on their soil, the proposed interceptors and radar were cast as a prudent hedge against Iran and a guarantee that Europe's security was indivisible from that of America, which was moving ahead with defenses for its own territory.
 But with Russia's rejection of a new American invitation to cooperate on missile defense -- a rebuff delivered with an exclamation point when the Kremlin threatened Thursday to pull out of a treaty on conventional weapons in Europe -- the initiative risked driving Moscow further from Europe and dividing Europe's public over the future of its shared security. 
The caustic exchanges between Washington and Moscow, which many Europeans fear will knock the lid off the ash bin of cold war history, were the latest example of how the United States and Russia say they want to work together but talk past each other.
 The United States says the missile defenses are all about Iran, which American intelligence agencies have said is developing missiles capable of reaching Europe as well as trying to gain the means of producing nuclear weapons. Moscow says that they are all about Moscow, that any Iranian threat is years away and that the bases really would serve as a Trojan horse to neutralize the Kremlin's strategic rocket forces.
 The United States says that its invitation to share missile defense technology and operate radar sites together would allow Russia to enter a more mature partnership with the United States and NATO, and that all sides would win. Russia responds that its every act of post-cold war conciliation has only left it more tightly encircled by NATO.
 Even before negotiations begin in earnest, both sides are staking out hard positions. The United States says Russia will have no veto over American missile defense bases in Central Europe. In response, Russia has said that the new offer has done nothing to alter its opposition, and that it is prepared to kick the legs out from under other arms control agreements to show its anger.
 To be sure, this missile defense drama is only in its opening scene. The two missile defense sites, expected to cost about $3.5 billion, are still years away.
 At some level, the debate over the missile defense system is not even about interceptors and radar installations. Their effectiveness is a matter of conjecture. It is about Russia's perception of, and insecurity about, its role in West-facing Europe.
 Thus, Washington and Moscow are playing to the populations of Poland and the Czech Republic, whose Parliaments would have to approve the bases, and beyond, to a broader and quite ambivalent European public.
 If the United States hoped that the tough talk this week from Moscow would unify Europe to rally publicly behind its plans to install 10 missile interceptors in Poland and a tracking radar in the Czech Republic, it is likely to be disappointed.
 Behind closed doors, America's European allies were indeed united in their negative reaction to the Russian threats during a meeting on Thursday in Oslo attended by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, NATO foreign ministers and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, according to American and European officials who were present or were briefed on the session.
 The Europeans took umbrage at the Russians' belligerence, after a conciliatory mission to Moscow by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates in which he offered to share missile defense technology with Russia. 
 ''For the Russians to turn around and slap us, it did not go over well with European governments today. That's for sure,'' said a senior American official, who spoke on diplomatic ground rules of anonymity. 
 ''There was virtual unanimity that Russia should work with the Americans and work with NATO on missile defense, as several delegations said, especially after the Americans have clearly gone out of their way to make constructive proposals to the Russians,'' the American official said.
 That version of events in Oslo, as presented by the senior American official, was confirmed by representatives of two European nations in attendance.
 Yet speaking publicly on Friday, European officials remained wary about the missile defense proposal, as they had been for months. 
 ''The core issue is to prevent a spiral of mistrust between Russia and the U.S.,'' said the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. ''And this is what is in our immediate European interest.''
 Other German politicians repeated qualms that an American missile defense system might upset the strategic balance in Europe or ignite a new arms race between Russia and the West. 
 Eckart von Klaeden, a foreign policy adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel and a supporter of Washington, predicted that the threat by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to pull out of the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe would not make Europe fall in line behind the United States.
 ''On the one hand, Germans are becoming more skeptical about Russia, but on the other hand, people are still using anti-Americanism as a tool,'' Mr. von Klaeden said. ''All the constructive things that the Americans have done in the past year haven't been welcomed here.''
 For Germany, analysts say, the most immediate effect of the deepening rift is to undermine Mrs. Merkel's efforts to forge closer economic and trade ties between the European Union and Russia. That had been a hallmark of her term as president of the European Union.
 ''Germany had prepared a very constructive new 'Ostpolitik' toward Russia,'' said Alexander Rahr, an expert on Russia at the German Council on Foreign Relations, referring to a policy of incremental steps to bring both sides closer. ''That is now being destroyed.''
 Mr. Rahr said the rift would put Mrs. Merkel in an increasingly awkward position because, while she hopes to preserve Germany's close ties to Russia, she does not want to antagonize the Bush administration.
 ''I don't understand why Putin came out like he did,'' Mr. Rahr said. ''It was much too harsh; it was a strategic mistake.''

HEADLINE: A Nation Bound By Colorful Dinnerware

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
''American Fiesta,'' a new one-man show written and performed by Steven Tomlinson, is as topically ambitious a theatrical effort as you will experience Off Broadway right now. It clips along with the energy of someone whose very metabolism seems to run on a hunger to understand himself and the world better. 
 Staged at the Vineyard Theater, the play counts as its themes the current ruptures in American civic life and politics; the psychological roots of consumer choice; the neuroscience of desire; gay marriage; the greater meaning of eBay; the search for human fraternity, neighborhood, community; the perils of focus grouping; and the sorrows of family life. 
You might be tempted to joke that ''American Fiesta'' seems to be about everything but the kitchen sink, except that it is about that too, or at least what falls into it. Mr. Tomlinson constructs his narrative around the development of his interest in Fiestaware, Depression-era ceramics whose potential for metaphor he finds inexhaustible. 
 Fiestaware was the invention of the Homer Laughlin China Company, which in the 1930s decided that what Americans needed to cheer themselves up was colorful, cost-efficient dinnerware, whose pieces could be purchased individually. If you broke one salad plate, you didn't have to replace your whole set. I know all this not because I did a Wikipedia search, but because Mr. Tomlinson enthusiastically supplies us with the china's history. He isn't quite so much wary of consumer markets as he is enthralled by their ingenuity. 
 Mr. Tomlinson holds a doctorate in economics from Stanford. He is a university lecturer in business and finance, a corporate consultant and a lay preacher. He could also add to his curriculum vitae that he is an affable, engaging performer. But the cleverness of his writing deflates amid his effusions of feeling.
 ''American Fiesta'' is full of well-observed moments and supremely tired ones. (No human being mentioning a feminine side should ever, for instance, refer to Barbie's Dream House.) The story that Mr. Tomlinson tells revolves around an announcement he makes to his parents that he will marry his partner, Leon, in Canada. 
 His mother and father, who live in rural Oklahoma, love him but don't see why this is necessary. Their disapproval leaves him desperate for familial closeness, and so he begins to collect Fiestaware, prompted by the memory of a big blue bowl that seemed to occupy a prominent role in his childhood.
 Soon he can think of nothing but the dishes and cups he doesn't have. An eBay addiction follows, and Mr. Tomlinson writes evocatively about the way the quest for things, and collecting specifically, can pull us too far away from treading the waters of real life. 
 The play, with its elegant set of open shelves holding pretty bowls, begins with a screen image of the human brain and Mr. Tomlinson talking about the chemistry of retail appetite. ''Its classic proportions register here,'' he says of Fiestaware, ''in your cerebral cortex.''
 When he finds out that a certain strain of Fiestaware contained a potentially dangerous form of uranium, he submits to the paranoia of a whole online subculture devoted to it. He examines PayPal records and eBay user profiles. ''The typical transaction is a 60-year-old woman in a Midwestern town selling to an urban bachelor on the coast,'' he announces. ''It's a plot!'' 
 Regrettably, Mr. Tomlinson is not wedded to this kind of levity throughout. He draws connections to his new passion for collecting that are trite, tenuous or overstated. He meets a blind woman who collects flawed pieces, and you know where this is going: to a self-inquiry on his insistence on perfection. He is compelled to spell out why certain collectors must possess every piece of Fiestaware, as if the allegory weren't obvious enough: they need to feel whole, and he does too. 
 What Mr. Tomlinson wants, ultimately, is for everyone to get along, for the whole country to feel put back together, red Fiestaware Americans and blue Fiestaware Americans. In the end his effort is merely tepid advocacy theater and a byproduct of the very impulse for niftily aggressive packaging that he seems to wish our culture would squelch. 
 ''American Fiesta'' continues through May 20 at the Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; vineyardtheatre.org or (212) 353-0303.

HEADLINE: They'll Keep the Smoking Sign On

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
IN a classic example of basic marketing -- if everyone is zigging, it may be a good time for you to zag -- Extended Stay Hotels is embracing smokers. The chain, which operates 682 North American properties under, among others, the Extended Stay America, Homestead Studio Suites and Crossland Economy Studios brands, recently announced it planned to keep its smokers welcome policies in place, Hotels magazine reports.
 ''Smokers are still welcome to light up in common areas and designated rooms,'' the magazine writes. Tim Groves, Extended Stays executive vice president for sales and marketing, says there are no plans to restrict smoking anytime soon. 
''Among our guests there are a lot of smokers, and we would like them to know that they can go to any of our hotels in the U.S. and Canada and be able to smoke there,'' Mr. Groves said.
 This policy flies in the face of smoking bans both nationwide and within major hotel chains. For example, Westin and Marriott International have banned smoking, the magazine reports.
 Some 15 percent of the customers of the Extended Stay chain, which the Lightstone Group is in the process of acquiring from Blackstone for $8 billion, smoke, Mr. Groves said, adding that since the average customer stays 20 nights, forcing him to go outside every time he wanted a cigarette would not work.
 Mr. Groves says there have been few complaints from nonsmokers about the company's smoking policy. MATCH GAME -- ''Elite status on one airline can often be parlayed into elite status on another,'' Jean Chatzky writes in Travel + Leisure.
 Say you have achieved elite status on Continental, but all things being equal, you would rather fly on Delta. Call Delta and say you would love to give them your business, if they match the perks you get from Continental.
 They'll usually do it, Ms. Chatzky writes, if you put your request in writing and send a copy of your last mileage statement. SAIL AWAY -- Not sure how to spend your summer vacation? Showboats International has some suggestions: 
 For $298,798 a week, plus expenses, you can rent the 204-foot Force Blue, which has ''one of the largest and most elaborate spas we have seen.'' 
 If dancing is more your speed, for about the same price, there's the 192-foot Magna Grecia, which has a ''huge alfresco disco on the bridge deck.'' 
 And would-be moguls can rent the 289-foot Maltese Falcon for $454,692 a week, plus expenses. The boat is owned by the venture capitalist Thomas Perkins. 
 You could always split the cost. It sleeps 12. WHAT'S NEW? -- Among the 10 new products Business 2.0 highlights in the current issue is a technology that replaces electric wires; cellphones that give the ability to watch TV in real time, and the widespread introduction of what can only be described as smell-o-vision.
 ''Powercast and its first major partner, electronics giant Philips, are set to launch their first device powered by electricity broadcast through the air,'' the magazine writes. ''A transmitter plugs into the wall, and a dime-size receiver can be embedded into any low-voltage devices. The receiver turns radio waves into DC electricity, recharging the device's battery at a distance of up to three feet.''
 The technology could make chargers, like the ones used for cellphones, obsolete.
 Speaking of cellphones, by the end of this year AT&T and Verizon will be offering services that broadcast live TV channels, like MTV, ESPN, CBS and Fox, to your cellphone. This raises the question of whether you really want to watch anything on a two-inch screen. 
 And this month, 100 gas stations in California will be auditioning technology that ''wafts coffee aroma at the pump'' in an effort to increase sales at the stations' convenience stores; Clear Channel is experimenting with scented billboards and Wal-Mart is introducing experimental DVDs that release ''the odor of a burning building, say, or a freshly fired gun, at precisely timed moments during the movie.'' FINAL TAKE -- This from Entrepreneur, citing work done by Kelton Research: Some 65 percent of Americans spend more time with their home computers than they do with their spouse or significant other.

HEADLINE: Economy At Its Slowest In 4 Years

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Economic growth slowed to its weakest pace in four years during the first three months of 2007, underscoring how the persistent slump in the housing market continued to serve as a drag on the American economy. 
 In its first estimate of economic growth for the quarter, the Commerce Department said the nation's gross domestic product, the most comprehensive measure of overall economic activity, expanded 1.3 percent for the quarter, barely over half the rate recorded in the final quarter of last year.
The abrupt slowdown was not enough to put a brake on inflation, however. The consumer price index most carefully monitored by the Federal Reserve, which excludes food and energy, rose 2.2 percent in the quarter, at an annual rate, above the Fed's stated comfort ceiling. 
 ''It's sort of more inflation, less growth,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial. ''That's not a tasty combination.''
 On Wall Street, economists had forecast a slide in growth, but not one this sharp. The dollar plunged against the euro, briefly falling to a record low as investors factored in expectations of faster growth and rising interest rates in Europe against low growth and the possibility of lower rates in the United States. 
 But bond yields rose slightly, indicating deeper concern about potentially higher inflation. Stocks -- which have risen almost uninterruptedly since early March, defying concerns over a potential economic weakening -- ended mixed.
 Economists said that the latest report card left the Fed in even more of a quandary over interest rates, with a weaker economy prodding it to cut rates to stimulate growth but inflationary pressures pushing it toward higher rates to curb price increases. The end result is likely to be a decision by the central bank to keep rates where they are until a clearer picture emerges. 
 ''It's a bugaboo for the Fed,'' said John Silvia, chief economist at the Wachovia Corporation, the bank holding company. ''It is a difficult spot to be in.''
 As throughout much of last year, the housing slump was the biggest anchor on the economy. Home construction recorded its sixth consecutive quarterly decline, falling 17 percent at an annual rate and subtracting almost a full percentage point from G.D.P.
 Still, there were several upbeat signals in the economic report that suggested to many economists that the pace of growth could pick up this year. Business investment rebounded from its slowdown late last year to expand at a 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter. Silicon Valley was a key to the revival: investment in information technology contributed more than half a percentage point to growth in the quarter.
 And despite the worrisome state of housing, Americans continued to borrow and buy. In the first quarter consumer spending grew 3.8 percent, a fairly vigorous pace. 
 But economic weakness also spread beyond housing. After a sharp cut in inventories in the fourth quarter of last year, businesses slimmed their stockpiles a little more in the first quarter of 2007, shaving 0.3 percentage points from economic growth. A decline in military spending by the government trimmed a quarter of a percentage point percent from total output. 
 Trade provided the biggest surprise, when exports fell unexpectedly and imports continued growing, subtracting half a percentage point from economic growth, according to the report. 
 Economists pointed out that the preliminary data on trade is particularly sketchy because the government did not yet have a good handle on exports and imports in March. But the data bewildered some analysts, who pointed out that the combination of a weak dollar and faster growth in Europe and elsewhere should be providing a lift to exports. 
 ''We completely discount this number,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight of Lexington, Mass. ''It's inconsistent with everything else going on in the world.'' 
 He suggested the estimate for first-quarter exports could be revised upward. And if not, he predicted, exports should record a sharp upswing in the spring quarter that is under way now. 
 The weakness in the economy and the poor trade results contributed to the dollar rout early in the trading day. And some analysts on foreign exchange markets argued that the dollar could well continue its long fall against key currencies like the euro and the British pound. 
 ''The divergence in monetary policy and economic growth between Europe and the U.S. is going to grease the wheels of those central banks who want to diversify their reserves away from the U.S. dollar,'' said Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign exchange analyst at CMC Markets U.S., a financial trading company. 
 And a number of economists noted several reasons for the expected slow growth in coming quarters. The main one is the possibility of weaker consumer spending. 
 ''Rapidly rising energy prices and falling consumer confidence suggest that consumption growth will slow markedly in the second quarter,'' Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist with Capital Economics, wrote in a research report.
 Moreover, some experts forecast that the relatively strong job market of recent months -- unemployment has fallen to 4.4 percent and wage gains have outpaced inflation despite weak growth -- will buckle soon and kink consumer spending.
 ''Growth at this pace will loosen the labor market,'' wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., in a note to investors. ''The Fed will blink soon.''
 But traders who try to divine the Fed's actions were unmoved by the latest data. Futures markets put the chance that the Fed will cut interest rates from 5.25 percent to 5 percent by the end of the year at around 90 percent, about the same as before the new data was released.
 Mr. Behravesh suggested Fed governors seem confident that the economy is growing at an underlying, long-term rate of 2 to 2.5 percent, a rate at which they are comfortable.
 Some economists even suggested that higher inflation might prompt the Fed to raise, not cut, interest rates.
 ''The Fed has seen inflation numbers creep steadily up in this cycle,'' said Michael R. Englund, chief economist of Action Economics in Denver. ''We're going to see a first half of the year that is going to keep inflation pretty much above the Fed's target zone.''

HEADLINE: An Ex-C.I.A. Chief on Iraq and the Slam Dunk That Wasn't

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
 At the Center Of the Storm My Years at the C.I.A. By George Tenet with Bill Harlow Illustrated. 549 pages. HarperCollins. $30. 
 Since the publication of Bob Woodward's 2004 book, ''Plan of Attack,'' George J. Tenet, former director of Central Intelligence, has become best known for two words: ''slam dunk'' -- that is, for reportedly telling President Bush that intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was ''a slam dunk case!'' Those words have been quoted countless times, most notably by Vice President Dick Cheney, who, during a ''Meet the Press'' appearance last year, suggested that the administration had ''made a choice'' to go to war based on the ''slam dunk'' intelligence provided by the C.I.A. -- intelligence that later turned out to be wrong. 
In his much-anticipated and intermittently fascinating new memoir, ''At the Center of the Storm,'' Mr. Tenet writes that the whole ''slam dunk'' scene described in Mr. Woodward's book took his words out of context and ''had been fed deliberately to Woodward'' by someone in the White House eager to shift blame from the White House to the C.I.A. for what turned out to be a failed rationale for the Iraq war. In short, he says, he and the agency were set up as ''fall guys,'' and he was made to look like a fool -- rising up, throwing his arms in the air and saying those two words, as if he were ''Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah Winfrey's couch.'' 
 In fact, Mr. Tenet says he doubts that W.M.D.'s were the principal cause of the United States' decision to go to war in Iraq in the first place, that it was just ''the public face that was put on it.'' The real reason, he suggests, stemmed from ''the administration's largely unarticulated view that the democratic transformation of the Middle East through regime change in Iraq would be worth the price.''
 Mr. Tenet notes that his ''slam dunk'' remarks came ''10 months after the president saw the first workable war plan for Iraq,'' and ''two weeks after the Pentagon had issued the first military deployment order sending U.S. troops to the region.'' He points out that many senior Bush administration officials, including Paul D. Wolfowitz and Douglas J. Feith, were focused on Iraq long before 9/11, and that Mr. Cheney asked Bill Clinton's then-departing secretary of defense, William Cohen, before the 2001 inauguration to give the incoming president a comprehensive briefing on Iraq and detail possible future actions. 
 On the day after 9/11, he adds, he ran into Richard Perle, a leading neoconservative and the head of the Defense Policy Board, coming out of the White House. He says Mr. Perle turned to him and said: ''Iraq has to pay a price for what happened yesterday. They bear responsibility.'' This, despite the fact, Mr. Tenet writes, that ''the intelligence then and now'' showed ''no evidence of Iraqi complicity'' in the 9/11 attacks.
 Alternately withholding and aggrieved, earnest and disingenuous, ''At the Center of the Storm'' is interesting less for any stunning new revelations than for fleshing out a portrait of the Bush White House already sketched by reporters and former administration members. Mr. Tenet depicts an administration riven by factional fighting between the State and Defense Departments, hard-liners and more pragmatic realists, an administration given to out-of-channels policymaking, and ad hoc, improvisatory decision-making.
 ''There was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the imminence of the Iraqi threat,'' he writes of a war that has already resulted in more than 3,300 American military deaths, at least 60,000 Iraqi civilian deaths and already cost more than $420 billion. Nor, he adds, was there ''a significant discussion regarding enhanced containment or the costs and benefits of such an approach versus full-out planning for overt and covert regime change.'' 
 Mr. Tenet's book also ratifies the view articulated by former military, intelligence and Coalition Provisional Authority insiders that the White House repeatedly ignored or rebuffed early warnings about the deteriorating situation in post-invasion Iraq. Mr. Tenet writes that the C.I.A.'s senior officer in Iraq was dismissed as a ''defeatist'' for warning in 2003 of the dangers of a growing Iraqi insurgency, though it was already clear then that United States political and economic strategies were failing. Although the trends were clear, he adds, those in charge of policy ''operated within a closed loop.'' In that atmosphere, he says, bad news was ignored: the agency's subsequent reporting, which would prove ''spot-on,'' was dismissed.
 Mr. Tenet writes that there was ''no strategy for when U.S. forces hit the ground'' in Iraq, aside from a desire to put the exile Ahmed Chalabi (who had provided administration hawks with much unreliable prewar intelligence) in charge of the country: ''You had the impression,'' Mr. Tenet sarcastically writes, ''that some Office of the Vice President and D.O.D. reps were writing Chalabi's name over and over again in their notes, like schoolgirls with their first crush.'' 
 He is not optimistic about the current surge in Iraq: sectarian violence, he argues, has ''taken on a life of its own,'' and he sees American forces becoming increasingly ''irrelevant to the management of that violence.''
 On the controversial matters of the C.I.A.'s use of coercive interrogation techniques, its covert prison system abroad and its use of ''extraordinary rendition'' (whereby foreign terrorism suspects are sent to third countries for interrogation), Mr. Tenet simply stonewalls. He asserts that ''the most aggressive interrogation techniques conducted by C.I.A. personnel were applied to only a handful of the worst terrorists on the planet'' and that those interrogations were ''conducted in a precisely monitored, measured way intended to try to prevent what we believed to be an imminent follow-on attack.''
 Mr. Tenet does not grapple with reports that the C.I.A. has possibly been implicated in the deaths of at least four detainees in Afghanistan and Iraq. He does not grapple with the problem of sorting out the innocent people sometimes swept up in arrests along with genuine Qaeda suspects. And he sheds no light on the secret Justice Department memos establishing interrogation techniques. On the subject of Mr. Bush's secretly authorizing the National Security Agency to eavesdrop without a court order on calls and e-mail messages between the United States and other countries, Mr. Tenet suggests that the idea originated with Vice President Cheney, who he says called him shortly after 9/11 to ask ''if N.S.A. could do more'' than it was then doing under laws in place since the 1970s.
 Although Mr. Tenet acknowledges that the C.I.A. failed to predict the specifics of the 9/11 attack, he cites repeated warnings it issued, over the years, about the dangers posed by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Most notably, he describes the alarming intelligence he presented to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice at a July 10, 2001, meeting -- including information from late June of that year that predicted a ''big event'' was coming. Mr. Tenet's efforts to spin the C.I.A.'s own failure to watch-list two of the 9/11 hijackers when they first came across the agency's radar screen two and a half years earlier feel particularly lame: had they been caught, he suggests that Al Qaeda would simply have replaced the two men with other recruits.
 As for the C.I.A.'s role in the lead-up to the Iraq war, Mr. Tenet admits that the agency's reports about W.M.D.'s, cited in the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate, were flawed. He adds, however, that he himself believed Saddam Hussein possessed W.M.D.'s and he contests allegations that the C.I.A. caved to pressure from administration hard-liners on the matter of W.M.D.'s: ''Intelligence professionals did not try to tell policy makers what they wanted to hear,'' he writes, ''nor did the policymakers lean on us to influence outcomes.'' 
 Mr. Tenet also disputes the allegation made by Tyler Drumheller, the C.I.A.'s former head of the European division, that he -- Mr. Drumheller -- had raised serious questions about the credibility of a key source known as Curveball with top agency officials before the invasion. He does not, however, come to terms with Mr. Drumheller's other allegation, made on ''60 Minutes,'' that a C.I.A. source in Mr. Hussein's inner circle said in the fall of 2002 that the dictator had no active weapons-of-mass-destruction program and that this information was ignored. 
 Mr. Tenet describes himself as like his father, ''a very trusting man, loath to say anything bad about anyone,'' and notes that his staff jokingly called him ''the subliminal man'' -- based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit in which one of the cast members ''would say normal things like 'How are you, madam?' and then quickly and quietly mutter something different under his breath, such as 'You miserable twit.' '' And while he has some nice things to say in these pages about President Bush and Vice President Cheney, there often seems to be an unspoken subtext.
 According to Ron Suskind's 2006 book on the C.I.A., ''The One Percent Doctrine,'' Mr. Tenet felt indebted to the president for allowing him to keep his job after the 9/11 attacks, and Mr. Tenet repeatedly praises Mr. Bush in these pages as a focused leader, ''absolutely in charge, determined and directed.'' And yet, at the same time, Mr. Tenet depicts him as presiding over an often dysfunctional administration in which crucial decisions were made without a considered weighing of pros and cons, and expert advice often went unheeded.
 As for Mr. Cheney, Mr. Tenet describes thinking of him as very supportive of the intelligence community but then goes on to note numerous occasions in which the vice president delivered or planned to deliver bellicose speeches about Saddam Hussein that exceeded the available intelligence. 
 Mr. Tenet is more willing to take the gloves off with lower-ranked members of the administration. Condoleezza Rice comes across here as an ineffectual national security adviser, unwilling to make hard calls or mediate among warring parties. Stephen Cambone, undersecretary of defense for intelligence, comes across as a fool who discounted the C.I.A.'s warnings about Al Qaeda in the summer of 2001, asking Mr. Tenet if he had thought about the possibility that Al Qaeda's threat was ''just a grand deception, a clever ploy to tie up our resources.'' And Douglas Feith, undersecretary of defense for policy, who headed a Pentagon unit that provided the White House with dubious information about a possible Al Qaeda-Iraq connection, is mocked for providing ''Feith-based analysis.''
 Paraphrasing Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Mr. Tenet concludes: ''Policymakers are entitled to their own opinions -- but not to their own set of facts.''

HEADLINE: Federal Official Resigns In Inquiry of Escort Service

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
The head of the Agency for International Development, Randall L. Tobias, resigned abruptly on Friday for what he said were ''personal reasons,'' but an administration official said Mr. Tobias's name had come up in an investigation of a suspected Washington prostitution ring. 
 On Friday night, ABC News said Mr. Tobias had confirmed on Thursday that he was a customer of an escort service.
A woman from Vallejo, Calif., Deborah J. Palfrey, has pleaded not guilty to charges that she operated a call-girl service in Washington, and has threatened on her Web site to sell her client list to raise money for her defense. ABC News reported that Ms. Palfrey had given the network thousands of phone numbers of clients. 
 In court papers filed on April 11 in Federal District Court here, she identified an adviser to the Pentagon as ''one of the regular customers'' of her service. She posted the man's photo from his own Web site and tax records on a house he owns in Washington.
 On her Web site, Ms. Palfrey asserted that her service, doing business as Pamela Martin and Associates, ''functioned as a high-end adult fantasy firm which offered legal sexual and erotic services across the spectrum of adult sexual behavior.''
 Mr. Tobias told ABC that he used the service for massages, not sex, according to the network's Web site.
 The State Department referred all questions to Mr. Tobias's personal office in Indianapolis. There was no reply to a message left there on Friday night. At his Washington apartment building, the concierge said Mr. Tobias was not in.
 Mr. Tobias, 65, is a former chairman and chief executive of Eli Lilly & Company and of AT&T International. He served as the chairman of the board of Duke University from 1997 to 2000. He was also a major donor to various Republican campaigns.
 President Bush nominated him in July 2003 to lead a $15 billion program to fight AIDS worldwide. 
 At the time, some AIDS experts said Mr. Tobias did not have much experience with AIDS or Africa. 
 Then, as director of United States Foreign Assistance, he held the rank of ambassador. 
 In January 2006, Mr. Bush said he would nominate Mr. Tobias to be the administrator of the Agency for International Development. That position gave him the rank of deputy secretary of state. 
 The White House did not confirm the circumstances of the resignation. Dana Perino, a White House spokeswoman, said the president expressed ''sadness and disappointment'' that Mr. Tobias was resigning. Mr. Bush expressed appreciation for Mr. Tobias's work here and around the world, Ms. Perino said, and ''wished his family well in the future.''

The Interior Department has put the final touches on a five-year plan to expand oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore from Alaska and Virginia. 
 Department officials said Friday that the plan would include more environmental buffer zones around lease areas and make other minor changes to a previous draft. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne will announce the ''major oil and gas development program'' on Monday, a department statement says.
The new leasing plan ''would significantly increase the nation's domestic energy supplies while protecting the coastal and marine environments, and provide a major economic stimulus to the nation and participating coastal states,'' the statement said.
 Details were sketchy, but in January, President Bush ended drilling bans in an area of the central Gulf of Mexico and in Bristol Bay in Alaska. That action cleared the way for making an area in the Gulf of Mexico south of the Florida Panhandle available for drilling. The ''Lease Area 181'' is a small part of 8.2 million acres that Congress approved for oil and gas development in December.
 Mr. Bush's action also allowed the opening of 5.6 million acres to drilling in waters northwest of the Alaska Peninsula, known for endangered whales and the world's largest run of sockeye salmon. The Interior Department plans to sell leases there in 2010 and 2012, pending environmental reviews. An estimated 200 million barrels of oil and 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas exist under those federal waters.
 The plan would, for the first time, allow drilling off the Eastern Shore of Virginia, in a wedge-shaped area between the Maryland and North Carolina state lines stretching to a point about 200 miles east.
 Congress put the Bristol Bay off limits to drilling in 1990 after the devastating Exxon Valdez tanker oil spill on the other side of the Alaskan peninsula. The bay is a major fishing area for salmon, cod, red king crab, halibut and herring. Congress lifted that ban in 2003, but the area remained under a presidential drilling ban until Mr. Bush lifted it in January.
 Mr. Kempthorne has said his department is looking at conducting one or two lease sales there over the next five years, but only after thorough environmental reviews. Environmentalists say the proposed leasing areas overlap the migratory route for all the wild salmon returning to Bristol Bay and the western Alaska river system.
 Congress will have until the end of June to review the final drilling plan for all three areas.

HEADLINE: The South Under Siege, Yet Again

BYLINE: By Lee Smith. 
Lee Smith is the author, most recently, of the novel ''On Agate Hill.''

DATELINE: Hillsborough, N.C. 

 BODY:
I LIVE in an old house on the main street of this North Carolina county seat, population 6,162, about 40 miles northwest of Raleigh. It's a rural place still, I guess, but things have been changing ever since the Old South turned into the Sun Belt and, even more so, since Money magazine wrote up our area last year as one of the five best places in America to live. What's it like to be ''discovered'' after 250 years? 
 A quick walk down King Street tells the tale. 
 Whatever you need, the Dual Supply hardware store has got it -- though the proprietor, Wesley Woods, may be the only one who can find it on the crowded shelves, which have looked ''pretty much the same'' ever since he started working here at ''8 or 9 years old, putting up stock, sweeping and changing tires.'' He's not worried about the big-box stores going up down by Interstate 85: ''Your people are your business, and my people aren't going away.'' 
 True, there's a steady stream in and out as a contractor, John Shoneman, picks up a couple of pounds of nails and ''just writes it down.'' Other customers ''pay so much per month.'' There's no computer.
 Across the street we find Evelyn Lloyd's little family drugstore, which she opened in 1987 after years of working alongside her daddy, Allen Alexander Lloyd, in the James Pharmacy. They had a soda fountain back at the James, Evelyn says, and sold gift sets of Evening in Paris at Christmas. ''Daddy knew everybody -- anybody who needed help,'' she said. ''If they couldn't pay, that was O.K.'' Evelyn's father was on the town council for 30 years; she has served for 16. She worries about the problems that have come with development. ''We're forcing people to move out,'' she says. ''Where are they going to go?'' 
 Nestled between her pharmacy and Carolina Game and Fish (featuring a sign in the window for its Turkey Contest, entry fee $15, along with hunting bows, fishing tackle, camouflage clothing and bright orange hats) we find Cup a Joe, with its latte, cappuccino, chai and multiply pierced baristas, doing a thriving business. Even more sophisticated is the authentic patisserie two doors down, owned and run by Eric Valour, recently of Lyon, France. We ain't quaint no more.
 I join Mayor Tom Stevens for coffee in Cup a Joe, his ''morning office.'' The Wooden Nickel bar is his afternoon office. Everybody seems to like Tom, a longtime resident who ran for office because he ''had a sense that this town was on the verge,'' and he wanted Hillsborough to ''be successful in a way that is good for human beings.'' 
 He touts Hillsborough's ''authenticity,'' deriving from its small-town character and its strong heritage -- from Occaneechi Native American roots to its Revolutionary and Civil War history, to the jazz singers, mill workers and farmers of the last century. ''We're in good shape, with a 40 percent business base and 3.3 percent unemployment rate,'' and he touts our vitality, with a newly vibrant street life epitomized by the monthly ''Last Friday'' festival featuring barbecue, bluegrass and blues.
 But the mayor wonders how to ''create a sense of belongingness for everybody,'' especially everybody in the big new suburbs outside town. Bulldozers are rumbling in every direction. ''We are under huge development pressure,'' says the mayor. ''Now we have to choose our future, and we have to do it right.'' 
 Up Churton Street, at Tony's Barbecue, the Price brothers, Donny and Lee, aren't so sure about all this. Like the Dual Supply, Tony's has stayed the same ever since anybody can remember, serving the best sausage biscuits in town -- some say in the entire South -- for $1.09 apiece, or 2 for $1.79, made from scratch every day. I like to get mine with mustard on it. 
 ''They're going to mess up Hillsborough'' is Donny's opinion about all the new and planned development. ''They're tearing down woods and running off the deer,'' he says. ''It's driving the country out.''
 Lee agrees. ''You can kill somebody and get away with it if you've got enough money,'' he says. ''It ain't nothing to build something.''

HEADLINE: Lingering Fog of Chemotherapy Is No Longer Ignored as Illusion

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
On an Internet chat room popular with breast cancer survivors, one thread -- called ''Where's My Remote?'' -- turns the mental fog known as chemo brain into a stand-up comedy act. 
 One woman reported finding five unopened gallons of milk in her refrigerator and having no memory of buying the first four. A second had to ask her husband which toothbrush belonged to her.
At a family celebration, one woman filled the water glasses with turkey gravy. Another could not remember how to carry over numbers when balancing the checkbook. 
 Once, women complaining of a constellation of symptoms after undergoing chemotherapy -- including short-term memory loss, an inability to concentrate, difficulty retrieving words, trouble with multitasking and an overarching sense that they had lost their mental edge -- were often sent home with a patronizing ''There, there.'' 
 But attitudes are changing as a result of a flurry of research and new attention to the after-effects of life-saving treatment. There is now widespread acknowledgment that patients with cognitive symptoms are not imagining things, and a growing number of oncologists are rushing to offer remedies, including stimulants commonly used for attention-deficit disorder and acupuncture. 
 ''Until recently, oncologists would discount it, trivialize it, make patients feel it was all in their heads,'' said Dr. Daniel Silverman, a cancer researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy. ''Now there's enough literature, even if it's controversial, that not mentioning it as a possibility is either ignorant or an evasion of professional duty.''
 That shift matters to patients.
 ''Chemo brain is part of the language now, and just to have it acknowledged makes a difference,'' said Anne Grant, 57, who owns a picture-framing business in New York City. Ms. Grant, who had high-dose chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant in 1995, said she could not concentrate well enough to read, garbled her sentences and struggled with simple decisions like which socks to wear.
 Virtually all cancer survivors who have had toxic treatments like chemotherapy experience short-term memory loss and difficulty concentrating during and shortly afterward, experts say. But a vast majority improve. About 15 percent, or roughly 360,000 of the nation's 2.4 million female breast cancer survivors, the group that has dominated research on cognitive side effects, remain distracted years later, according to some experts. And nobody knows what distinguishes this 15 percent. 
 Most oncologists agree that the culprits include very high doses of chemotherapy, like those in anticipation of a bone marrow transplant; the combination of chemotherapy and supplementary hormonal treatments, like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors that lower the amount of estrogen in women who have cancers fueled by female hormones; and early-onset cancer that catapults women in their 30s and 40s into menopause.
 Other clues come from studies too small to be considered definitive. One such study found a gene linked to Alzheimer's disease in cancer survivors with cognitive deficits. Another, using PET scans, found unusual activity in the part of the brain that controls short-term recall. 
 The central puzzle of chemo brain is that many of the symptoms can occur for reasons other than chemotherapy.
 Abrupt menopause, which often follows treatment, also leaves many women fuzzy-headed in a more extreme way than natural menopause, which unfolds slowly. Those cognitive issues are also features of depression and anxiety, which often accompany a cancer diagnosis. Similar effects are also caused by medications for nausea and pain. 
 Dr. Tim Ahles, one of the first American scientists to study cognitive side effects, acknowledges that studies have been too small and lacked adequate baseline data to isolate a cause.
 ''So many factors affect cognitive function, and the kinds of cognitive problems associated with cancer treatment can be caused by many other things than chemotherapy,'' said Dr. Ahles, the director of neurocognitive research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. 
 The new interest in chemo brain is, in effect, a testimony to enormous strides in the field. Patients who once would have died now live long enough to have cognitive side effects, just as survivors of childhood leukemia did many years ago, forcing new treatment protocols to avoid learning disabilities. 
 ''A large number of people are living long and normal lives,'' said Dr. Patricia Ganz, an oncologist at U.C.L.A. who is one of the nation's first specialists in the late side effects of treatment. ''It's no longer enough to cure them. We have to acknowledge the potential consequences and address them early on.'' 
 As researchers look for a cause, cancer survivors are trying to figure out how to get through the day by sharing their experiences, and by tapping expertise increasingly being offered online by Web sites like www.breastcancer.org and www.cancercare.org. 
 There are ''ask the experts'' teleconferences, both live and archived, and fact sheets to download and show to a skeptical doctor. Message boards suggest sharpening the mind with Japanese sudoku puzzles or compensatory techniques devised to help victims of brain injury. There are even sweatshirts for sale saying ''I Have Chemo Brain. What's Your Excuse?''
 Studies of cognitive effects have overwhelmingly been conducted among breast cancer patients because they represent, by far, the largest group of cancer survivors and because they tend to be sophisticated advocates, challenging doctors and volunteering for research. 
 Most researchers studying cognitive deficits say they believe that those most inclined to notice even subtle changes are high-achieving women juggling careers and families who are used to succeeding at both. They point to one study that found that complaints of cognitive deficits often did not match the results of neuro-psychological tests, suggesting that chemo brain is a subjective experience. 
 ''They say, 'I've lost my edge,' '' said Dr. Stewart Fleishman, director of cancer supportive services at Beth Israel and St. Luke's/Roosevelt hospitals in New York. ''If they can't push themselves to the limit, they feel impaired.'' 
 Dr. Fleishman and others were pressed as to why a poor woman, working several jobs to feed her children, navigating the health care system and battling insurance companies, would not also need mental dexterity. ''Maybe we're just not asking them,'' Dr. Fleishman said. 
 Overall, middle-class cancer patients tend to get more aggressive treatment, participate in support groups, enroll in studies and use the Internet for research and community more than poor and minority patients, experts say.
 ''The disparity plays out in all kinds of ways,'' said Ellen Coleman, the associate executive director of CancerCare, which provides free support services. ''They don't approach their health care person because they don't expect help.'' 
 But approaching a doctor does not guarantee help. Susan Mitchell, 48, who does freelance research on economic trends, complained to her oncologist in Jackson, Miss., that her income had been halved since her breast cancer treatment last year because everything took longer for her to accomplish.
 She said his reply was a shrug.
 ''They see their job as keeping us alive, and we appreciate that,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''But it's like everything else is a luxury. These are survivor issues, and they need to get used to the fact that lots of us are surviving.'' 
 Among women like Ms. Mitchell, lost A.T.M. cards are as common as missing socks. Children arrive at birthday parties a week early. Wet clothes wind up in the freezer instead of the dryer. Prosthetic breasts and wigs are misplaced at the most inopportune times. And simple words disappear from memory: ''The thing with numbers'' will have to do for the word ''calculator.'' 
 Linda Lowen, 46, had a hysterectomy and chemotherapy for ovarian cancer 13 years ago, and says she still cannot recognize neighbors at the grocery store. ''I had a mind like a steel trap, and I ended up with a colander for a brain,'' said Ms. Lowen, a radio and television talk show host in Syracuse. 
 The other night, Ms. Lowen set out to find a good place to store her knitting supplies. She began emptying a cabinet of games that her teenage daughters no longer played. Meanwhile, she noticed a blown light bulb and went to find a replacement. That detour led to another, and five hours later she had scrubbed every surface and tidied the contents of eight drawers. But she still had no storage space for her knitting supplies. 
 ''I have an almost childlike inability to follow through on anything,'' Ms. Lowen said.
 Solutions come in many forms for women whose cancer treatment has left them with cognitive deficits. 
 Sedra Jayne Varga, 50, an administrative assistant in family court in Manhattan, is part of a research study of the stimulant Focalin, which she said had helped. But Ms. Varga also plans to have laser surgery on her eyes so that losing her glasses will no longer be an issue. 
 Lu Ann Hudson, 44, a designer of financial databases in Cincinnati, relies on a key fob that sets off a beep in her car when she is looking for it in parking lots. Terry-Lynne Jordan, 43, who analyzes environmental incidents for an oil company in Calgary, Alberta, uses the calendar on her computer and voice mail messages to herself to remind her of meetings. 
 And Debbie Kamplain, a 32-year-old stay-at-home mother in Peoria, Ill., hired a $30-an-hour personal organizer to help her sell a house, buy another and get ready to move her family to Indiana next month. 
 But it is Ms. Kamplain's 2 1/2-year-old son, Daniel, who sees to it that she stays on task. Long before Daniel could talk, he would pull her over to the refrigerator if she got distracted while getting him a drink. 
 ''Poor kid,'' Ms. Kamplain said. ''I say I'm going to do something, forget about it immediately, and he's the one who has to remind Mommy about stuff.''

HEADLINE: Do Your Homework (or Buy an Index Fund)

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DON'T even consider holding actively managed mutual funds unless you're willing to switch funds often. All other fund investors should simply buy and hold an index fund for the long term.
 That's the conclusion of a new study that has been circulating this month as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. The study, ''Return Persistence and Fund Flows in the Worst Performing Mutual Funds,'' was written by Jonathan B. Berk, a professor of finance at the University of California, Berkeley, and Ian Tonks, a professor of finance at the University of Exeter in Britain. A version is at nber.org/papers/w13042.
The study is based on a theory that Professor Berk helped develop several years ago, about how flows among mutual funds affect their subsequent returns. This theory is unlike many that come out of academia, because it is based on the idea that many managers have genuine stock-picking ability. The reason that so few mutual funds beat the market over the long term is that investors shift too much money into the successful ones, or so the theory goes. As a result, these funds' managers quickly become swamped with more money than they can invest profitably, causing performance to suffer. 
 A helpful analogy, Professor Berk said in an interview, is to the so-called Peter Principle, which predicts that employees will be promoted until they reach their level of incompetence. Similarly, a mutual fund manager who beats the market will continue to attract more assets until he can no longer beat the market.
 The theory deals with averages and probabilities. Professor Berk doesn't deny that lots of other factors besides cash inflows -- including luck -- can play large roles in a particular fund's performance. And he concedes that it's possible for a top-performing fund manager to continue beating the market for a number of years, even after his fund receives a huge influx of new cash. But the theory nevertheless predicts that the probability is very low that a top-ranked fund will remain top-ranked for very long.
 The data certainly provide strong support for this prediction: The mutual funds that have beaten the market in the recent past will rarely be able to keep doing so for longer than a few more months.
 This theory has been less successful, however, when applied to the worst-performing mutual funds. Less-able managers should become competitive once their portfolios become small enough, because, according to Professor Berk, it is easier to beat the market with a smaller portfolio than with a larger one. So, as investors shift money out of a lagging fund, its size should stabilize at whatever lower level is necessary to give its manager a fighting chance of beating the market.
 If this part of the theory were right, the worst performers would be no more likely to stay bottom-ranked than top performers to remain top-ranked. But that is not the case, according to the professors. A low-ranking performer, in fact, has a significantly greater chance of continuing to be a low-ranking performer than a top-ranking performer does of staying at the top.
 In the new study, the professors determined the source of the theory's failure: Many investors just won't sell their funds, regardless of how badly they are performing. By not selling, this loyal group prevents poor performers from becoming small enough that their managers can become competitive again.
 In their study, the professors did not analyze who these loyal investors might be, or why they would refuse to sell in the wake of poor performance. But Professor Berk says that their motivation may be as simple as an aversion to ''playing the game'' of constantly monitoring mutual funds' rankings and transferring money away from the losers and into the winners. After all, he said, this task can take much time and energy.
 Whatever the motivation of these loyal investors, Professor Berk argues that their existence means that the rest of us have to stay on our toes to avoid holding one of worst-performing funds. As a rule of thumb, he says that at least once a quarter, investors should determine how their funds rank in trailing 12-month returns. They should consider transferring their money out of any fund that is ranked in the bottom 20 percent and into a fund in the top 20 percent, assuming that they will incur very low transaction costs when doing so, he said. 
 PROFESSOR Berk acknowledges that such an approach runs the risk of unfairly selling a fund whose bad performance is only temporary. Nevertheless, he says that this rule of thumb ''keeps you out of the dogs'' -- which he says is of paramount importance if you invest in actively managed funds. If all of this sounds like too much work, he recommends that you stick with index funds. Above all else, he says, you shouldn't buy and hold actively managed funds without checking on them, because you run the risk of holding a fund that will consistently lag behind the market.

HEADLINE: Teed Up: Golf, K Street and Nigeria

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER; Senan Murray contributed reporting from Abuja, Nigeria.

DATELINE: UYO, Nigeria 

 BODY:
WITH the rainy season under way, and the weather sweltering, Nancy Lopez, a former championship golfer, hooked her tee shot into the rough. ''That was a jet-lag swing,'' she cheerily remarked to onlookers here, most of whom had never seen a golf club -- or certainly not a middle-aged woman in shorts who was swinging one.
 Ms. Lopez had come here on a late March day with two top golfers, Retief Goosen and Colin Montgomerie, to help inaugurate a new 18-hole course set in a landscape lush with palm trees. The oil-rich heart of the Niger Delta lies west of here, where armed gangs routinely kidnap foreigners for ransom.
Despite the nearby turmoil, this small city, the capital of a Nigerian state called Akwa Ibom, has remained tranquil, a point that the state's governor, Victor H. Attah, underscored as he described the new golf resort as an attractive destination for tourists and oil industry executives. 
 ''There is another Niger Delta, and I want the world to know that Americans can come here without fear,'' Mr. Attah told reporters at a recent news conference.
 As it turns out, one group of Americans had already made themselves comfortable: well-connected lobbyists and corporate consultants hunting for fees. Lobbying may bring to mind images of tasseled loafers, limousines and lavish offices on K Street in Washington. But there is another, less-studied side of the business that plays out on remote frontiers like this one, where opportunity, self-interest and money intersect. 
 In recent years, deal makers of all kinds have come from the United States to Nigeria, drawn by an oil-fueled boom that has underwritten airports, power plants, telecommunications start-ups and other ventures in this country, Africa's most populous. Despite Nigeria's abundant resources, most of its citizens remain impoverished. Others have become renowned worldwide as Internet-based hustlers, sending out scam e-mail messages that promise easy fortunes.
 But the story of how a luxury golf resort came to a remote corner of a desperately poor nation is part of a larger tale of role reversal in which American wheeler-dealers, rather than Nigerian ones, played leading roles. 
 Over the past two years, an unlikely cast of characters sought a piece of a multimillion-dollar public spending spree initiated by Mr. Attah, an ambitious politician who wanted to be Nigeria's next president. The group included a lobbyist who boasted of ties to the Bush White House, a bankrupt Las Vegas businessman who claimed to be a ''privatization expert,'' a publicly traded consulting firm that has several public luminaries in its ranks, and lesser-known door-openers in Washington and Nigeria whom law enforcement authorities have questioned in the bribery investigation of Representative William J. Jefferson of Louisiana.
 Holding center stage was Richard T. Hines, a lobbyist and consultant Mr. Attah hired in 2005 to represent Akwa Ibom in the United States. Mr. Hines, who has a passion for the old Confederacy, brought together a rag-tag band of confederates. Rivals also gathered and, as the golf resort's opening neared, a showdown ensued, one that produced an unlikely winner. 
 Nigeria is, of course, no stranger to corporate shell games and quick money schemes. Fraud, in all its varieties, is so common here that those who practice the craft are known as ''419ers,'' a reference to the section of the country's penal code that covers the crime. But a nose for opportunity and a taste for money is hardly indigenous to Nigeria.
 Kenneth Gross, a lobbying expert in Washington, said that while many lobbyists talk about venturing into developing countries like Nigeria in search of rich rewards, there is a special breed who actually do.
 ''It takes a real adventuresome spirit to take off their Gucci shoes and put on the hiking boots,'' he says. Then hoe it down and scratch your gravel, to Dixie Land I'm bound to travel. Look away, look away, look away, Dixie Land! -- from ''Dixie's Land'' 
 As musicians dressed in gray Civil War-era uniforms recently performed before a likeness of Gen. Robert E. Lee in Statuary Hall of the Capitol in Washington, a small assembly joined in by singing a rousing version of ''Dixie's Land.'' 
 The ceremony honored the birthday of the Southern military leader, an event that Mr. Hines typically attends as head of a chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Although he did not attend the celebration this month, few would have attributed his absence to a lack of zeal.
 A decade ago, for instance, Mr. Hines marched down a street in Richmond, Va., rebel battle flag in hand, to protest the unveiling of a statute there to the late black tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. Mr. Hines said that his grievance was not racial, but that the street was hallowed ground for Confederate monuments.
 ''The intent of the placement of the statue was to debunk our heritage,'' The Associated Press quoted him as saying.
 More recently, he helped pay for a stealth mailing campaign during the 2000 Republican presidential primaries that attacked Senator John McCain for criticizing South Carolina for flying the Confederate flag over its capitol. On festive occasions, Mr. Hines, a former South Carolina lawmaker, wears a tie emblazoned with the Stars and Bars, the first flag of the Confederacy.
 An African politician allied with a lobbyist who likes to whistle Dixie might seem an odd coupling. But in Mr. Hines, Mr. Attah found a Washington veteran who, while not the biggest lobbyist in town, had apparently carved out an influential niche.
 The Web site of his company, RTH Consulting, has boasted that ''You Have the Right Connections'' in Mr. Hines, and that the firm has ''an active voice in the current Bush administration.'' In his office, Mr. Hines displays photographs of himself alongside officials like Vice President Dick Cheney, according to visitors there.
 Mr. Hines did not respond to repeated interview requests in recent weeks or to a series of written questions. 
 But over the years, his lobbying and consulting clients have included the government of Cambodia; Philip Morris, the cigarette maker now known as the Altria Group; Schweitzer Aircraft, a manufacturer of helicopters; and the Ashbury International Group, a producer of military sniper equipment, according to public records and interviews.
 If Mr. Hines secured such high-profile clients through cultivated political connections or careful courting, he apparently stumbled into working for Mr. Attah through a random meeting in a neighborhood drugstore. Three years ago, Aisha Buhari, a middle-aged Nigerian woman, stood at a perfume counter inside a Washington pharmacy and, according to an African immigrant named Joshua Assiba who said he was also there, bought thousands of dollars of merchandise.
 ''You must be a rich woman, looking at the way you dress and spend money,'' Mr. Assiba recalls telling Ms. Buhari.
 As the pair struck up a conversation and subsequently became friends, Mr. Assiba, then a security guard, said she told him that her father was the former military ruler of Nigeria, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, and that her American friends included politicians like Mr. Jefferson of Louisiana.
 Mr. Assiba also said that she told him that Mr. Attah, the governor of Akwa Ibom, had asked her to look for consultants and lawyers who could help him pressure oil companies like Exxon Mobil to clean up pollution in the Nigerian state. 
 Mr. Assiba, who was scouting investors for his own African projects, had been introduced earlier to Mr. Hines. The lobbyist, Mr. Assiba told Ms. Buhari, was just the man Mr. Attah needed.
 EVEN by Nigerian standards, Akwa Ibom is a backwater. The streets of Uyo are lined with low-slung shacks roofed with rusted sheet metal, and the city's jumbled marketplace smells of food and sewage.
 But a few years ago, Mr. Attah, a former architect, started a massive building program. He contracted with the Le Meridien chain to construct and operate a five-star hotel for the golf resort. Not far away, DynCorp International, a multinational concern that offers construction and security services, was working on a new airport to handle jet flights. And elsewhere in Uyo, an industrial park that Mr. Attah hoped would lure high-tech companies was rising.
 The boom here, like those elsewhere in Nigeria, is paid for with oil revenues. Each of Nigeria's 36 states receives a share of the country's wealth. While some politicians squander that money or steal it, Mr. Attah, a short, affable man of 68, presents himself as an honest broker seeking to modernize his state. 
 Term limits barred him from running again for governor, and so he cast his eye on becoming Nigeria's next president. To prepare for that run, he needed to raise his profile at home and abroad. So when he received a telephone call from Ms. Buhari in 2005 endorsing Mr. Hines as someone who could help, he said he agreed to hire him.
 ''All I needed to do was ask Aisha if she knew him,'' Mr. Attah recalls.
 Mr. Attah says he knows Ms. Buhari's father, who is still a powerful Nigerian politician, by reputation. He also met her, he said, in 2001 when she accompanied a group of American politicians that included Mr. Jefferson to Akwa Ibom to see oil-related pollution problems there.
 Mr. Attah says that he and Mr. Hines came to terms. The Nigerian official agreed in the late summer of 2005 to pay him $1.2 million for a year's work, a very large sum by lobbying standards, experts say. 
 According to the contract and lobbying records, Mr. Hines's duties included meetings with government officials in Washington seeking aid for Akwa Ibom, finding companies and investors to come to the Nigerian state, and publicizing its economic opportunities.
 Ms. Buhari, who declined to be interviewed, did not receive a fee for any role she may have played in connecting Mr. Hines and Mr. Attah, according to the lobbyist's filings. 
 But in September 2005, a week after Mr. Attah signed the Akwa Ibom contract, Mr. Hines sent a letter to State Department officials in Nigeria urging them to renew Ms. Buhari's American visa; the letter stated that his firm had hired her as a ''consultant'' and that her contract was ''available on request'' for inspection.
 Despite the large amount of money that Mr. Attah paid Mr. Hines, the politician said he never looked into the backgrounds of either the lobbyist or the associates who followed Mr. Hines to Nigeria. If he had, he might have found that some of those associates had interesting backgrounds. In fact, a few of them had already been in Africa the year before -- to seek work from another client of Mr. Hines, the government of the nearby nation of Gambia.
 Consider C. Edward Creed, a businessman based in Las Vegas. In 2004, Mr. Creed, Mr. Hines and others tried to start an airline with direct flights from the United States to Gambia; that venture, which Mr. Creed financed with money apparently entrusted to him by others, never took off.
 Mr. Creed, who later filed for bankruptcy, was still licking his wounds from his Gambian misadventure when Mr. Hines called him with a new plan. The lobbyist suggested that he persuade Mr. Attah to hire him and that the two men would split any money he was paid, Mr. Creed contended.
 ''He was hired to get some privatization projects going and he said, 'O.K., you are going to be the face of this,' '' Mr. Creed said in an interview.
 Mr. Hines, meanwhile, also promoted a California telecommunications company, TechnoConcepts Inc., to Mr. Attah as an ideal joint venture partner. According to Mr. Attah, what Mr. Hines did not tell him was that he then had a contract with TechnoConcepts that paid him $10,000 a month. Mr. Hines also held TechnoConcepts stock options and was in line to receive bonuses for bringing new business to the company. He had also sought business for the company in Gambia.
 TechnoConcepts, which claims patents to valuable wireless technology, has never made a profit, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors are suing the company and its executives, contending fraud -- claims that TechnoConcepts and its officials deny.
 DISTANCE may be the reason that Mr. Attah did not scrutinize the backgrounds of Mr. Hines and his team; some 5,500 miles separate Uyo and Washington, and Internet access barely exists here. And Mr. Attah was initially delighted with one step that Mr. Hines did take: arranging a series of promotional articles prepared by The Washington Times's advertising department that described Akwa Ibom and Mr. Attah as Nigerian success stories.
 In one article, executives of TechnoConcepts Inc. discussed plans for a factory in Uyo, and a lawyer who apparently consulted with the firm's top executive praised Mr. Attah. ''His actions give potential investors confidence that he will fight for them too if they invest in his state,'' said that lawyer, Barry Witz. 
 Mr. Witz has never been able to see Mr. Attah's efforts in person. The reason: his ability to travel abroad was restricted after he pleaded guilty in 2004 to his role in a conspiracy to defraud investors in another telecommunications company. His lawyer said that anyone curious about Mr. Witz -- like Mr. Hines, for example -- could have easily found his criminal plea. 
 By last summer, Mr. Attah's enthusiasm for Mr. Hines had waned. Although Mr. Hines's lobbying filings state that he made numerous efforts on behalf of Akwa Ibom, including contacting a sports management agency, Mr. Attah decided not to renew Mr. Hines's contract. Mr. Attah complains that the lobbyist had not recruited any outside investors, had made no progress on the pollution issue and had not located celebrity golfers to appear at the resort's opening. 
 ''We lost because we trusted that he was a credible consultant,'' Mr. Attah says. 
 With the Nigerian elections approaching, Mr. Attah still needed a consultant to arrange for big-name golfers to attend the opening. He said he was willing to pay more than $1 million, a sum that would have also covered the golfers' appearance fees.
 Mr. Creed had tried to get the deal, but it was Ms. Buhari, the Nigerian woman, who suddenly re-emerged to snatch the prize.
 Last summer, while Mr. Attah was in Washington, she arranged for him to meet a consultant, Thomas P. Ondeck, an executive at the GlobalOptions Group, a publicly traded consulting firm in New York. 
 The firm's advisers and executives include Wesley K. Clark, the retired Army general; R. James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and William H. Webster, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and later the C.I.A. 
 Mr. Ondeck heads a GlobalOptions unit that specializes in crisis management and due-diligence work including inquiries related to identity fraud. He says that his firm quickly reached an agreement with Mr. Attah to work on the resort's opening, including help in recruiting the golfers, and that he was impressed by the easy rapport between Mr. Attah and Ms. Buhari.
 ''She has a lot of affection for him,'' Mr. Ondeck says. ''She kept calling him 'Uncle.' ''
 At Ms. Buhari's suggestion, Mr. Ondeck said his firm agreed to gather Mr. Creed's legal records from Nevada. Not long afterward, Mr. Attah confronted Mr. Creed with the information.
 ''He said, 'I like you but your company is in bankruptcy,' '' Mr. Creed recalls. ''I'm going to run for president and I don't need a political scandal.''
 WITH Mr. Hines and Mr. Creed out, and GlobalOptions in, the golf resort's debutproceeded smoothly. But for Mr. Attah, the event last month was also bittersweet. Hundreds of guests filled the hotel lobby, drinking, dining and enjoying the entertainment. Ms. Lopez and the other golf pros were there, all looking a little stunned after a 14-hour trip from Florida aboard a chartered jet. Mr. Ondeck was also at the event.
 Mr. Attah's political days were winding down. His party had passed him over as its presidential candidate. He was leaving office soon with many of his building projects unfinished; while the golf course is complete, the hotel, apart from its lobby, resembles a construction zone.
 A day after the gala, Mr. Attah, wearing a blue-and-red golf shirt and a straw hat, presided over a publicity event -- the Ibom Classic -- organized to christen the course. Teeing off in unison with Ms. Lopez and others, he duffed his shot, the ball dribbling a few yards. ''Mine went so far you couldn't even see it,'' he said good-naturedly.
 Elsewhere, some of the other players involved here were also moving along. 
 Mr. Creed has moved away from Las Vegas; after initial interviews, he did not return calls. Last fall, Mr. Assiba, the man who said he met Ms. Buhari in the drugstore, sued Mr. Hines in a Virginia state court. 
 He contended that Mr. Hines had promised to pay him 20 percent of any money he made working for Mr. Attah in exchange for his aid in getting the contract. In court papers, Mr. Hines has rejected Mr. Assiba's assertion. Both he and his lawyer declined comment on the lawsuit.
 As for Ms. Buhari, who is living in Virginia, it's not clear who she really is. For one, she is under investigation in Nigeria by its Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, said its head, Nuhu Ribadu.
 Mr. Ribadu said he is uncertain if her name is Aisha Buhari, but he added that she is not a daughter of General Buhari. The former Nigerian ruler agrees. 
 ''I don't have any relationship with that Aisha Buhari,'' Mr. Buhari said. ''I don't have any daughter called Aisha Buhari living outside this country. She is not my daughter.''
 Mr. Ribadu's agency has asked American authorities to arrest Ms. Buhari. That has not happened, but the Justice Department has an interest in her. Last summer, she testified before a grand jury investigating Mr. Jefferson, the congressman, who is suspected of soliciting bribes from American companies seeking business in Nigeria.
 The Nigerian official said that American authorities suspect that Ms. Buhari may have served as a financial conduit for the politician. Mr. Jefferson has not been charged with any crimes and has denied any wrongdoing; his lawyer declined to comment. Mr. Ondeck, whose experience as a lawyer is highlighted on GlobalOptions' Web site, accompanied Ms. Buhari to the courthouse on the day of her testimony. But he did not go as her lawyer; several years ago, he was disbarred. 
 Mr. Ondeck, when told that Ms. Buhari was under investigation in Nigeria, said that he had ''no information about the matter.'' He also declined to say whether GlobalOptions had any paid her any money. 
 Mr. Hines recently testified in a deposition in Mr. Assiba's lawsuit that he had learned last year from Nigerian officials that Ms. Buhari was under investigation. Soon after learning that, he said he wrote a letter to American officials in Nigeria that followed the one in September 2005 that asserted he had a contract with Ms. Buhari. Mr. Hines stated that he told officials in the second letter that he had not hired her. 
 On a recent day, Ms. Buhari stepped out of her town house in suburban Washington, wearing a long blue patterned dress and a head scarf decorated with strands of colorful threads. She declined to speak with a reporter seeking an interview.
 ''You have no business here,'' she said. ''I'll call the authorities.''
 In Nigeria, the golf resort in Uyo is temporarily closed. Its Web states that it is scheduled to open for guests in early July.

HEADLINE: If It Stayed the Same, That Would Be Different

BYLINE: By CLAIRE WILSON

 BODY:
CHANGE has been the one constant in Pleasant Plains, a small, once sleepy hamlet on Raritan Bay close to the southernmost tip of Staten Island. 
 Towering old trees define the hamlet, which in the last census had a population of nearly 5,000, and which is best described as a patchwork of residential pockets scattered among swaths of wetlands, woods and waterfront conservation area.
But in the last five years, storm and sanitary sewers and new water mains have been installed, and zoning has been adjusted to protect Pleasant Plains's 1.6 square miles from the building of houses on too-small parcels -- which had been happening with some regularity. 
 Modifications like this never occur in a vacuum, of course, and the town has its share of vocal advocates on each side of the zoning question. 
 Marie Bodnar, district manager of Community Board 3, comes down on the side of more protective zoning. ''Overdevelopment has been a problem throughout the South Shore,'' she said in a recent interview, during which she expressed satisfaction with the changes. ''Now, a builder can't take down one house and put up three.'' 
 Randy Lee, chief executive of the Leewood Real Estate Group, the developer of the 22-home Estates at Opal Ridge in Pleasant Plains, takes the opposing stance. He contends that any such zoning restrictions should be deferred until the entire borough is subjected to planners' scrutiny and a comprehensive master plan emerges on judicious development. 
 ''All downzoning does is increase the minimum size of the lot, making the resulting lots more expensive and the houses that are built on them more expensive,'' said Mr. Lee, who is also chairman of the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation. ''The goal of the proposers is to just have million-dollar houses that only rich people can afford.''
 But anything that preserves open space can only be an asset to Dennis D. Dell'Angelo, an architect who is president of the Pleasant Plains/Princes' Bay/Richmond Valley Civic Association. ''A lot of people move here because of the open space and the feeling you get in those neighborhoods,'' said Mr. Dell'Angelo.
 Although he sings the praises of local schools and emphasizes the safety of Pleasant Plains -- citing its low crime rates -- he acknowledges that it is the closeness to nature and the small-town ambience that residents seem to love the most. 
 ''It is a small community that people have pride in,'' he said. It is also a homogeneous community, by city standards -- 92 percent white, according to census data. What You'll Find 
 Pleasant Plains is bordered by the waterfront to the east, the property of the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin-Mount Loretto to the south, the Korean War Veterans Parkway to the north and, to the west, a vague line created by Lemon Creek, Bayview Avenue and Lenevar Avenue, according to Mr. Dell'Angelo. But he and other residents concur that the borders with adjacent communities of Princes' Bay and Richmond Valley are fuzzy at best. 
 The houses are a mix of new mansion-style homes on large plots of land, some town homes and many two-family units with studio or one-bedroom rental apartments. Some blocks have clusters of older Victorian-style homes and 1920s side-hall colonials on dead-end streets without curbs or sidewalks. 
 Two houses are being considered for landmark status, one a Second Empire structure built in the 1880s and the other an 1850s Greek Revival. If they are named landmarks, they will be the only two buildings in Pleasant Plains to be so designated. 
 Jack Chadwick, a sergeant with the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, bought ''the worst house in the nicest neighborhood'' about eight years ago when he moved in from Mariner's Harbor, also on Staten Island. He tore the house down and built a new one, then acquired adjoining land to ensure that the woodsy environment would be maintained. A collector of Ford Mustangs that he has restored, he enjoys the amenities of being part of the city but without the downside of traffic, pollution and noise. Above all, he said, Pleasant Plains is an excellent place to raise his three daughters, who attend local schools. 
 ''Everybody knows me and my kids,'' said Mr. Chadwick, whose annual Christmas lights extravaganza, held on his lawn the weekend after Thanksgiving as a neighborhood inaugural of the holiday season, has made him something of a local celebrity. ''It's nice to know that if they're out, somebody is going to be looking out for them.'' What You'll Pay 
 The current inventory of houses for sale is about 18, according to Adam Weintraub, owner of the Berns Agency, a local realty company.
 But with a number of new homes coming to market in the last year, prices have dropped 10 or 15 percent, said Fred Shayewitz, an agent with Richmond Homes/GMAC. ''The tide has turned from an active sellers' market to a soft buyers' market,'' he said. ''Buyers are in command.'' 
 Adrienne Setbon, a broker with Own-a-Home Realty, is the exclusive representative for a community of 22 one- and two-family detached homes still under construction. Asking prices for a one-family unit with three or four bedrooms and three and a half baths start at $789,000. 
 According to Ms. Setbon, new detached homes in Pleasant Plains generally start at $800,000, while semiattached units average around $675,000, and town homes, which zoning no longer allows, typically resell for about $550,000. 
 Older homes, often on large parcels, are less expensive. Mr. Weintraub said a 1935 three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath colonial on a 75-by-171-foot lot sold recently for $631,000, while another, also a three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath, built in 1909, sold for $675,000. Its lot measured 106 by 109 feet.
 Among Mr. Weintraub's current listings is a 70-by-160-foot buildable lot on a dead-end street that backs onto a nature preserve with a small pond. The asking price is $699,000. 
 Rental units in the community are most often in newer two-family homes. Studios run about $750 a month, while one-bedroom units are about $900 a month, Mr. Weintraub said. Rentals at the new Opal Ridge are $850 a month for a one-bedroom, according to Ms. Setbon. What to Do 
 The environs of Pleasant Plains are great for walking and bicycling. There is a public fishing pier at the end of Sharrott Avenue, adjacent to a seaside nature preserve. Five minutes away by car or bus, the 17th-century fieldstone Conference House is famous as the site of a peace conference on Sept. 11, 1776, an ill-fated attempt to avert the Revolutionary War. The park has a gazebo looking out over the Arthur Kill and a busy calendar of events. 
 The Catholic Youth Organization center at the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin, also known as Drumgoole Village at Mount Loretto, has programs for young people that include basketball, indoor soccer and summer camp. It also plays host to about 200 seniors a day from the Tottenville and Pleasant Plains Senior Citizens Friendship Clubs, in conjunction with the New York City Department for the Aging. 
 Shopping options include small stores near the train station, as well as nearby Amboy Plaza, which has a Waldbaum's supermarket, Eckerd drugstore and Dunkin' Donuts.
 The Staten Island Mall is about seven minutes away by car. Also less than 10 minutes away near the Outerbridge Crossing are Target and Home Depot, among others. 
 The Woodbridge Center in Woodbridge, N.J., is also a popular destination. ''You are so close to the Outerbridge you can go shopping in Jersey where there are no taxes,'' said Barbara Corregano, an independent broker. The Commute 
 The AE7 Atlantic Express bus goes to Midtown Manhattan from a lot at the intersection of the West Shore Expressway and the Korean War Veterans Memorial Parkway. The trip takes about an hour and 20 minutes; monthly tickets are $228.
 Taking the Staten Island Railway to the Staten Island Ferry takes 27 minutes and costs $2. The ferry to Manhattan takes 25 minutes and is free; transfer to the subway is free. 
 The rush-hour commute by car can take one hour and 25 minutes. According to David Solowitz, a construction worker who commutes from Pleasant Plains to points around the city by car, the traffic on the Staten Island Expressway ''is really bad, especially at rush hour.'' The Schools 
 Public schools in the area are highly regarded. Public School 3 on South Goff Avenue has about 720 students in prekindergarten through Grade 5. Of fourth graders in the academic year ended in 2006, 85.6 percent scored at or above grade level in English, compared with 60.4 percent of fourth graders citywide. In math, the number was 94 percent, versus 78.3 percent citywide. 
 Two schools teach Grades 6 through 8. At Intermediate School 34 on Academy Street, 68.3 percent of eighth graders scored at or above grade level in English in 2006, compared with 32.9 percent citywide. In math, the number was 67.5 percent, versus 40.9 percent citywide. Among eighth graders at Intermediate School 7 on Huguenot Avenue, 71.3 percent scored at or above grade level in English, 72.2 percent in math. 
 Tottenville High School on Luten Avenue offers Grades 9 through 12; enrollment is about 3,700. SAT averages in 2005 were 478 on the verbal portion, versus 497 statewide, and 487 on math, versus 511 statewide. 
 One private option is the Roman Catholic St. Joseph-St. Thomas School on Maguire Avenue. According to the principal, JoAnn Gaal, 330 are enrolled in prekindergarten through Grade 8. Tuition is $3,200 a year for parishioners. Nearby religious schools for Grades 9 through 12 include the Roman Catholic St. Joseph-by-the-Sea and the boys-only Yeshiva of Staten Island. The History 
 Pleasant Plains remained largely undeveloped until well into the 20th century. It got its name in 1860, when it was designated a stop on the new railroad, and a commercial hub sprang up around the train station, according to the Encyclopedia of the City of New York.
 It is best known as the site of Mount Loretto, or the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin, a Lower Manhattan orphanage that moved to Pleasant Plains in the early 1880s. Scenes from ''The Godfather'' were shot there. A Snapshot 
 Large open spaces woven in among the residential pockets help preserve the uncongested and quiet feel of the area, whose many dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs are safe havens for children.

SECTION: Section 1; Column 3; Foreign Desk; THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ -- ANBAR RISING: Life Returns to Ramadi; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 2615 words

HEADLINE: Uneasy Alliance Is Taming One Insurgent Bastion

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: RAMADI, Iraq 

 BODY:
Anbar Province, long the lawless heartland of the tenacious Sunni Arab resistance, is undergoing a surprising transformation. Violence is ebbing in many areas, shops and schools are reopening, police forces are growing and the insurgency appears to be in retreat. 
 ''Many people are challenging the insurgents,'' said the governor of Anbar, Maamoon S. Rahid, though he quickly added, ''We know we haven't eliminated the threat 100 percent.''
Many Sunni tribal leaders, once openly hostile to the American presence, have formed a united front with American and Iraqi government forces against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. With the tribal leaders' encouragement, thousands of local residents have joined the police force. About 10,000 police officers are now in Anbar, up from several thousand a year ago. During the same period, the police force here in Ramadi, the provincial capital, has grown from fewer than 200 to about 4,500, American military officials say.
 At the same time, American and Iraqi forces have been conducting sweeps of insurgent strongholds, particularly in and around Ramadi, leaving behind a network of police stations and military garrisons, a strategy that is also being used in Baghdad, Iraq's capital, as part of its new security plan. 
 Yet for all the indications of a heartening turnaround in Anbar, the situation, as it appeared during more than a week spent with American troops in Ramadi and Falluja in early April, is at best uneasy and fragile. 
 Municipal services remain a wreck; local governments, while reviving, are still barely functioning; and years of fighting have damaged much of Ramadi.
 The insurgency in Anbar -- a mix of Islamic militants, former Baathists and recalcitrant tribesmen -- still thrives among the province's overwhelmingly Sunni population, killing American and Iraqi security forces and civilians alike. [This was underscored by three suicide car-bomb attacks in Ramadi on Monday and Tuesday, in which at least 15 people were killed and 47 were wounded, American officials said. Eight American service members -- five marines and three soldiers -- were killed in two attacks on Thursday and Friday in Anbar, the American military said.] 
 Furthermore, some American officials readily acknowledge that they have entered an uncertain marriage of convenience with the tribes, some of whom were themselves involved in the insurgency, to one extent or another. American officials are also negotiating with elements of the 1920 Revolution Brigades, a leading insurgent group in Anbar, to join their fight against Al Qaeda.
 These sudden changes have raised questions about the ultimate loyalties of the United States' new allies. ''One day they're laying I.E.D.'s, the next they're police collecting a pay check,'' said Lt. Thomas R. Mackesy, an adviser to an Iraqi Army unit in Juwayba, east of Ramadi, referring to improvised explosive devices. 
 And it remains unclear whether any of the gains in Anbar will transfer to other troubled areas of Iraq -- like Baghdad, Diyala Province, Mosul and Kirkuk, where violence rages and the ethnic and sectarian landscape is far more complicated.
 Still, the progress has inspired an optimism in the American command that, among some officials, borders on giddiness. It comes after years of fruitless efforts to drive a wedge between moderate resistance fighters and those, like Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who seem beyond compromise. 
 ''There are some people who would say we've won the war out here,'' said Col. John. A. Koenig, a planning officer for the Marines who oversees governing and economic development issues in Anbar. ''I'm cautiously optimistic as we're going forward.'' A New Calm 
 For most of the past few years, the Government Center in downtown Ramadi, the seat of the provincial government, was under near-continual siege by insurgents, who reduced it to little more than a bullet-ridden bunker of broken concrete, sandbags and trapped marines. Entering meant sprinting from an armored vehicle to the front door of the building to evade snipers' bullets. 
 Now, however, the compound and nearby buildings are being renovated to create offices for the provincial administration, council and governor. Hotels are being built next door for the waves of visitors the government expects once it is back in business. 
 On the roof of the main building, Capt. Jason Arthaud, commander of Company B, First Battalion, Sixth Marines, said the building had taken no sniper fire since November. ''Just hours of peace and quiet,'' he deadpanned. ''And boredom.'' 
 Violence has fallen swiftly throughout Ramadi and its sprawling rural environs, residents and American and Iraqi officials said. Last summer, the American military recorded as many as 25 violent acts a day in the Ramadi region, ranging from shootings and kidnappings to roadside bombs and suicide attacks. In the past several weeks, the average has dropped to four acts of violence a day, American military officials said. 
 On a recent morning, American and Iraqi troops, accompanied by several police officers, went on a foot patrol through a market in the Malaab neighborhood of Ramadi. Only a couple of months ago, American and Iraqi forces would enter the area only in armored vehicles. People stopped and stared. The sight of police and military forces in the area, particularly on foot, was still novel. 
 The new calm is eerie and unsettling, particularly for anyone who knew the city even several months ago. 
 ''The complete change from night to day gives me pause,'' said Capt. Brice Cooper, 26, executive officer of Company B, First Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, First Infantry Division, which has been stationed in the city and its outskirts since last summer. ''A month and a half ago we were getting shot up. Now we're doing civil affairs work.'' A Moderate Front 
 The turnabout began last September, when a federation of tribes in the Ramadi area came together as the Anbar Salvation Council to oppose the fundamentalist militants of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. 
 Among the council's founders were members of the Abu Ali Jassem tribe, based in a rural area of northern Ramadi. The tribe's leader, Sheik Tahir Sabbar Badawie, said in a recent interview that members of his tribe had fought in the insurgency that kept the Americans pinned down on their bases in Anbar for most of the last four years. 
 ''If your country was occupied by Iraq, would you fight?'' he asked. ''Enough said.'' 
 But while the anti-American sheiks in Anbar and Al Qaeda both opposed the Americans, their goals were different. The sheiks were part of a relatively moderate front that sought to drive the Americans out of Iraq; some were also fighting to restore Sunni Arab power. But Al Qaeda wanted to go even further and impose a fundamentalist Islamic state in Anbar, a plan that many of the sheiks did not share. 
 Al Qaeda's fighters began to use killing, intimidation and financial coercion to divide the tribes and win support for their agenda. They killed about 210 people in the Abu Ali Jassem tribe alone and kidnapped others, demanding ransoms as high as $65,000 per person, Sheik Badawie said. 
 For all the sheiks' hostility toward the Americans, they realized that they had a bigger enemy, or at least one that needed to be fought first, as a matter of survival. 
 The council sought financial and military support from the Iraqi and American governments. In return the sheiks volunteered hundreds of tribesmen for duty as police officers and agreed to allow the construction of joint American-Iraqi police and military outposts throughout their tribal territories. 
 A similar dynamic is playing out elsewhere in Anbar, a desert region the size of New York State that stretches west of Baghdad to the Syrian and Jordanian borders. Tribal cooperation with the American and Iraqi commands has led to expanded police forces in the cities of Husayba, Hit, Rutba, Baghdadi and Falluja, officials say.
 With the help of the Anbar sheiks, the military equation immediately became simpler for the Americans in Ramadi. The number of enemies they faced suddenly diminished, American and Iraqi officials said. They were able to move more freely through large areas. With the addition of the tribal recruits, the Americans had enough troops to build and operate garrisons in areas they cleared, many of which had never seen any government security presence before.
 And the Americans were now fighting alongside people with a deep knowledge of the local population and terrain, and with a sense of duty, vengeance and righteousness.
 ''We know this area, we know the best way to talk to the people and get information from them,'' said Capt. Hussein Abd Nusaif, a police commander in a neighborhood in western Ramadi, who carries a Kalashnikov with an Al Capone-style ''snail drum'' magazine. ''We are not afraid of Al Qaeda. We will fight them anywhere and anytime.''
 Beginning last summer and continuing through March, the American-led joint forces pressed into the city, block by block, and swept the farmlands on its outskirts. In many places the troops met fierce resistance. Scores of American and Iraqi security troops were killed or wounded. 
 The Ramadi region is essentially a police state now, with some 6,000 American troops, 4,000 Iraqi soldiers and 4,500 Iraqi police officers, including an auxiliary police force of about 2,000, all local tribesmen, known as the Provincial Security Force. The security forces are garrisoned in more than 65 police stations, military bases and joint American-Iraqi combat outposts, up from no more than 10 a year ago. The population of the city is officially about 400,000, though the current number appears to be much lower.
 To help control the flow of traffic and forestall attacks, the American military has installed an elaborate system of barricades and checkpoints. In some of the enclaves created by this system, which American commanders frequently call ''gated communities,'' no vehicles except bicycles and pushcarts are allowed for fear of car bombs. 
 American commanders see the progress in Anbar as a bellwether for the rest of country. ''One of the things I worry about in Baghdad is we won't have the time to do the same kind of thing,'' Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, commander of day-to-day war operations in Iraq, said in an interview here.
 Yet the fact that Anbar is almost entirely Sunni and not riven by the same sectarian feuds as other violent places, like Baghdad and Diyala Province, has helped to establish order. Elsewhere, security forces are largely Shiite and are perceived by many Sunnis as part of the problem. In Anbar, however, the new police force reflects the homogeneous face of the province and appears to enjoy the support of the people. A Growing Police Force 
 Military commanders say they cannot completely account for the whereabouts of the insurgency. They say they believe that many guerrillas have been killed, while others have gone underground, laid down their arms or migrated to other parts of Anbar, particularly the corridor between Ramadi and Falluja, the town of Karma north of Falluja and the sprawling rural zones around Falluja, including Zaidon and Amariyat al-Falluja on the banks of the Euphrates River. American forces come under attack in these areas every day. 
 Still other guerrillas, the commanders acknowledge, have joined the police force, sneaking through a vetting procedure that is set up to catch only known suspects. Many insurgents ''are fighting for a different side now,'' said Brig. Gen. Mark Gurganus, commander of ground forces in Anbar. ''I think that's where the majority have gone.'' 
 But American commanders say they are not particularly worried about infiltrators among the new recruits. Many of the former insurgents now in the police, they say, were probably low-level operatives who were mainly in it for the money and did relatively menial tasks, like planting roadside bombs. 
 The speed of the buildup has led to other problems. Hiring has outpaced the building of police academies, meaning that many new officers have been deployed with little or no training. Without enough uniforms, many new officers patrol in civilian clothes, some with their heads wrapped in scarves or covered in balaclavas to conceal their identities. They look no different than the insurgents shown in mujahedeen videos. 
 Commanders seem to regard these issues as a necessary cost of quickly building a police force in a political environment that is, in the words of Colonel Koenig, ''sort of like looking through smoke.'' The police force, they say, has been the most critical component of the new security plan in Anbar. 
 Yet, oversight of the police forces by American forces and the central Iraqi government is weak, leaving open the possibility that some local leaders are using newly armed tribal members as their personal death squads to settle old scores. 
 Several American officers who work with the Iraqi police said a lot of police work was conducted out of their view, particularly at night. ''It's like the Mafia,'' one American soldier in Juwayba said.
 General Odierno said, ''We have to watch them very closely to make sure we're not forming militias.'' 
 But there is a new sense of commitment by the police, American and Iraqi officials say, in part because they are patrolling their own neighborhoods. Many were motivated to join after they or their communities were attacked by Al Qaeda, and their successes have made them an even greater target of insurgent car bombs and suicide attacks.
 Abd Muhammad Khalaf, 28, a policeman in the Jazeera district on Ramadi's northern edge, is typical. He joined the police after Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia killed two of his brothers, he said. ''I will die when God wills it,'' he said. ''But before I die, I will support my friends and kill some terrorists.'' The Tasks Ahead 
 Some tribal leaders now working with the Americans say they harbor deep resentment toward the Shiite-led administration of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, accusing it of pursuing a sectarian agenda. Yet they also say they are invested in the democratic process now. 
 After boycotting the national elections in 2005, many are now planning to participate in the next round of provincial elections, which have yet to be scheduled, as a way to build on the political and military gains they have made in recent months. 
 ''Since I was a little boy, I have seen nothing but warfare -- against the Kurds, Iranians, Kuwait, the Americans,'' Sheik Badawie said. ''We are tired of war. We are going to fight through the ballot box.'' 
 Already, tribal leaders are participating in local councils that have been formed recently throughout the Ramadi area under the guidance of the American military.
 Iraqi and American officials say the sheiks' embrace of representative government reflects the new realities of power in Anbar. ''Out here it's been, 'Who can defend his people?' '' said Brig. Gen. John R. Allen, deputy commanding general of coalition forces in Anbar. ''After the war it's, 'Who was able to reconstruct?' ''
 Indeed, American and Iraqi officials say that to hold on to the security gains and the public's support, they must provide services to residents in areas they have tamed.
 But successful development, they argue, will depend on closing the divide between the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad, which has long ignored the province, and the local leadership in Anbar, which has long tried to remain independent from the capital. If that fails, they say, the Iraqi and American governments may have helped to organize and arm a potent enemy.

HEADLINE: Turning to Churches or Scripture to Cope With Debt

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky. 

 BODY:
Doug Sweeney, a police officer, watched his credit card balance grow to $13,000, thinking he would never be able to pay it off. Renee Santiago had $40,000 in student loans. Susan Hancock owed $14,000 in credit card debt and could not point to anything in her home to show for it. 
 ''I saw it going up,'' Ms. Hancock said, ''but I was numb. I thought, that's just the way of life.''
When the debt got to be too much for them, instead of going to family members or financial professionals for help, they did what many Americans are doing: they turned to their church. 
 ''You need a little help with motivation,'' said Mr. Sweeney, 47, who blamed years of impulsive spending for his debt. Recently, he joined two dozen others at Southeast Christian Church for Week 9 of a 13-week debt-reduction program called Financial Peace University. Since joining the group, he had disposed of his credit cards. 
 ''A big part of it is that it has a faith component,'' he said. ''God wants you to be good stewards of your money. The money's all his.'' 
 As Americans have run up nonmortgage debt of more than $2.4 trillion, churches and Christian radio stations are supplementing their spiritual counseling with financial counseling, often using programs developed by other Christian organizations and marketed in church circles or over the Internet. They offer a mix of basic budget planning, household cost-cutting and debt management, bolstered by Scripture and with tithing as a goal. 
 ''We want to be relevant and to scratch people where they itch,'' said Dave Stone, the senior pastor at Southeast, a nondenominational church that draws 18,000 worshipers each weekend. ''For a church not to provide some service for people who are suffocating from too much debt would be burying our head in the sand.'' Economists have recognized that the behavior of consumers often ignores their rational best interests. People overestimate their ability to repay loans, or spend more using credit cards than they would with cash. Church-based debt programs provide rules to force changes in spending and saving, then use Scripture to motivate people. 
 More than 39,000 churches have used debt reduction programs created by Crown Financial Ministries, a group in Gainesville, Ga. About 3,000 churches have bought a $250 Good Sense program developed by Willow Creek Community Church in Barrington, Ill. Both are nonprofit organizations. 
 ''Nothing in the Bible says you can't borrow,'' said Mike Graham, who provides free financial counseling at Southeast Christian Church, in a position he created 10 years ago after stepping down as the church's financial manager. ''What you're not allowed to do is borrow and not pay it back.'' 
 The programs resemble secular plans, with two exceptions, said Dave Briggs, director of the Good Sense Stewardship Ministry at Willow Creek. ''A secular adviser might say, it's O.K. to stiff your creditors through bankruptcy,'' Mr. Briggs said. ''Biblically, bankruptcy is only an option if you need time and space to pay back what you owe.'' 
 ''The other conflict is in the area of giving,'' he said. ''We get a sense of devotion to God by being generous. Secular advice says, don't give until you can afford it.'' 
 The Financial Peace program, a curriculum marketed for profit by a radio host, Dave Ramsey, has been used in more than 10,000 churches, as well as 1,000 corporations and 350 military units or chapels, according to Mr. Ramsey's representative. 
 More than 350,000 families have completed the program, at a cost of $80 to $90 each for books, audio CDs and other material, the representative said. Mr. Ramsey declined to answer questions about how much money is taken in by the company. 
 Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America, who reviewed the Financial Peace materials for The New York Times, said the advice was ''fundamentally sound,'' especially for people with low or middle incomes. 
 ''It's better than you get from a lot of financial advisers, who make it complicated and possibly subject consumers to avoidable credit risks,'' Mr. Brobeck said. 
 Even tithing might help some Christians feel ''empowered to pay back their debt faster, though the secular perspective would be that those funds could be used directly to pay down debt,'' he said. 
 At Southeast Christian Church, a video presentation featuring Mr. Ramsey was followed by an hour of discussion, mixing quotations from Proverbs with advice on buying used cars, time shares and generic drugs. The discussion was led by a retired police officer, Rusty Bittle, 43, who has no financial background but who paid $2,000 to take a 50-hour course to become a certified counselor for Mr. Ramsey's program. 
 ''If you really start listening to the Scriptures we read each class,'' Mr. Bittle told the group, ''you'll see that this isn't just a finance class, it's about how to live your life. And if you read the Scriptures you'll get a blessing out of it.'' 
 Mr. Sweeney said the program's use of Scripture helped with his overspending. ''I realized that I blow a lot of money,'' he said. ''It takes discipline to manage it, and prayer helps you have discipline. If you think you need something, before you buy it, go home and pray about it.'' 
 Mr. Ramsey said that although the program has a ''biblical base,'' it was not aimed specifically at Christians, and that his books and radio show were most popular with secular stores and stations. 
 ''Even if you're not some kind of sold-out believer, you can relate to Proverbs 22, Verse 7, that the borrower is a slave to the lender,'' he said. ''It's like a Mark Twain saying.''
 Southeast Christian Church uses both the Financial Peace and Crown Ministries courses, and works with a Christian organization called Family Credit Counseling Service in Illinois, as well as secular credit counseling. 
 Anna and Jon Broster turned to Mr. Graham for help after the interest rate on one of their credit cards rose to 33 percent. Mrs. Broster (pronounced like ''Brewster'') paid off the balance of $900, but was left with $3,000 on her other cards. 
 ''I wanted to focus on getting out of credit card debt,'' she said. ''We live week to week, with no budget.'' The couple said they turned to Mr. Graham rather than a professional because they trusted the people at the church. ''He's not making money off us,'' Mrs. Broster said. ''And he's a Christian.'' 
 Mr. Broster, 27, earns $15 an hour in a manufacturing job and $140 every two weeks from a part-time job at a Walgreens. Mrs. Broster, 25, attends nursing school part time while raising their 4-year-old daughter. 
 Each month, when Mrs. Broster receives her credit card statements online, she checks her bank balance, sets aside some money for food and gas, and divides what is left among four or five cards. She tries to pay more than the minimum but finds it hard to get the balances down. 
 ''My dad is more conservative about credit card usage than me,'' she said. ''If I see something I like, I can just swipe and have it.'' She added, ''If I had to hand over $70, I'd think twice about it.'' 
 When she went to see Mr. Graham, she said, he prayed with her and said he would help her draw up a household budget, which she said she wanted to include tithes to the church. ''We don't give every week now, and I feel kind of guilty about it,'' she said.
 Mr. Graham said, ''We believe there's a mandate in Scripturethat calls for people to give 10 percent to the church. Until they can get to a tithe, we encourage a sliding scale so they can get their blessing from God.'' 
 In the Financial Peace classroom, Mr. Bittle was finishing the lesson. ''Remember,'' he told the group, ''there's only one way to attain financial peace, and that's to walk with the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ.''

HEADLINE: Family Secrets

BYLINE: By EVA HOFFMAN. 
Eva Hoffman is the author of ''After Such Knowledge: Memory, History, and the Legacy of the Holocaust'' and ''The Secret,'' a novel.

 BODY:
THE VISIBLE WORLD
 By Mark Slouka.
 242 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $24.
Early in Mark Slouka's novel ''The Visible World,'' the protagonist, a child of Czech refugees from World War II, speaks of ''an entire universe and its times, its stained-glass windows and its vaulted ceilings'' he used to sense ''beneath the world I had known -- so very familiar to me, so very American.'' In this thoughtful and evocative if sometimes sentimental novel, Slouka -- himself the son of Czech immigrants -- explores a problem surely familiar to us all, but perhaps especially acute for children of transplanted parents. How do you come to understand a history that has shaped you, but that you have not experienced? How do you fathom a world from which in a sense you come, but which you do not know? How do you penetrate the personalities and pasts of your parents if you have grown up far from the sites of their memories? 
 In addressing these questions, Slouka's second novel joins a growing genre of what might be called second-generation quests -- attempts, by children of immigrants or Holocaust survivors, to track down and apprehend a remote and often traumatic ancestral history. Far from being a linear account of a search for roots, however, ''The Visible World'' proceeds through a kind of imaginative archaeology, sending probes into strata of time, examining fragments of excavated evidence and reflecting on layers of meaning concealed under, and revealed through, the familiar appearances of the visible world. 
 The first section, ''The New World: A Memoir,'' depicts the ostensibly true events of the narrator's childhood, spent in Queens and in the Poconos. Slouka evokes the wistful atmosphere of an immigrant community, with its disabled war veterans and possible collaborators, its wry humor and bittersweet nostalgia. The narrator grows up surrounded by glimmers of bucolic Czech villages, intimations of illicit secrets and riddling fragments of stories whose veracity is often unclear, and whose significance he only half understands. The novel abounds in metaphors of submerged worlds and, in the child's mind, visions of underwater elves and enchanting forest maidens derived from Czech fairy tales (Czech phrases are sprinkled throughout the text) coexist with the image of a spooky but all too real crypt, in which seven resistance fighters hid after the famous attempt to assassinate the Nazi leader Reinhard Heydrich. 
 The most significant unseen presence in the narrator's young life, however, is that of a man whom his mother apparently loved before she married his father and whom she cannot, or will not, forget. The father, a decent, ruefully ironic man, remains devoted to his wife despite her emotional infidelity. She, however, is increasingly claimed by the memory, or fantasy, of a phantom lover. Her moods of affectionate playfulness alternate with bouts of mental and actual absence; eventually, she kills herself by walking under a bus. 
 In the novel's second section, ''Prague: Intermezzo,'' the narrator travels to his parents' homeland, in the hope that learning more about their past will help him unravel the sad enigma of his mother's suicide. His searches take him through a series of places and brief encounters, sketched with deft, economical strokes. Slouka has a knack for conveying errant details and impressions, the sense of promise and of sheer haphazardness that constitutes a traveler's reality. The narrator sees an aged crone who might be a personification of time itself; meets with gruff villagers who remember the war sufficiently to quarrel about the details of a particular day's weather; talks with a stranger who may have come close to the Heydrich plot. None of these tantalizing clues, however, yield clear meaning; and in the third, longest section of the novel, the narrator turns to his imagination to supply the missing parts of his mother's story. 
 ''1942: A Novel'' is that story, in the narrator's fictional version. This is an interesting formal move, and an apt expression of the narrator's -- indeed the second generation's -- quandary. In a sense, children of immigrant parents always have to fictionalize their parents' stories, to construct them from shreds of knowledge and distant recollection. In the shift from ''nonfiction'' to ''fiction,'' Slouka articulates both the uncertainties of cross-generational memory and the need to fill in the gaps. 
 Unfortunately, the fiction the narrator invents is a tale of love and war so fantastically and at the same time conventionally romantic that it strains the modern reader's patience, rather than reinforcing imaginative conviction. In the novel within the novel, the narrator's mother meets Tomas Bem, an imaginary eighth conspirator in the Heydrich plot, at a nighttime session of a resistance cell. They are so irresistibly attracted to each other that after only a few hours they decide to ignore all their obligations -- she is already involved with the narrator's future father -- and walk back into the forest from which they have just emerged. Their affair takes place in this idyllic wilderness, where they cook on an improvised fire, run naked through the rain and find shelter in a rustic cabin. The intensity of their affair is increased by the looming necessity of parting; and after several days, Tomas leaves, just in time to join his fellow conspirators in their dangerous venture. 
 The attempt to kill Heydrich goes awry, as it did historically, and the conspirators are forced to go into hiding, in the iconic church crypt of the narrator's childhood mythology. The narrator-novelist has a chance to peer into the crypt once again, this time through a more mature lens; and the passages in which he imagines the conspirators' confinement are grittily suggestive, conjuring the atmosphere of boredom, camaraderie and growing anxiety, especially when the young conspirators learn of Heydrich's death and the terrible reprisals that followed, in which many hundreds of people were murdered. 
 In the midst of this collective tragedy, the romance resumes. Tomas comes briefly out of hiding, and the two lovers spend a night together in the relatively safe refuge of a cemetery. It is because Tomas is not with his fellow conspirators that night that he avoids capture and execution. Soon after, however, his guilt, compounded by knowledge that he was probably suspected of betrayal, overwhelms him. 
 The interweaving of history and imagination in this section, of fairy-tale motifs with their adult revisions, is effective, braiding together all the elements of the narrator's mental world. The problem is that the excesses of the fictional scenario diminish the seriousness of the ''real'' story, rather than expanding its scope or deepening its significance. 
 This is a pity, because ''The Visible World'' is in many ways a delicately imagined and beautifully rendered novel. The descriptions of nature are precise and sensuous; the vignettes of minor characters vivid and razor sharp. Slouka writes perceptively about the ambiguities of human behavior -- both within the ordinary circumstances of marriage, and in the extreme conditions of war. The first two sections can almost stand on their own as a meditation on the impossibility of fully knowing another person, or of plumbing the past. 
 If Slouka's attempt to delve directly into that past is less successful than his oblique approach, this may reflect the difficulty -- often discernible in second-generation texts -- of confronting our parents' daunting historical dramas without transmogrifying them into psychological fantasy or flattening them into melodrama. Still, ''The Visible World'' is a sensitive and formally inventive elaboration of complex and elusive themes; despite its flaws, there is much to enjoy in its hidden implications and its nuanced narrative surfaces.

HEADLINE: Vudu Casts Its Spell On Hollywood

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
FOR the last two years, the employees of Vudu Inc. have quietly toiled in a nondescript office in Santa Clara, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley. The only hint of the company's plans are black-and-white Rat Pack photos that adorn its walls and oversized models of Gollum and R2D2 that watch over its cubicles.
 Insiders familiar with Vudu's hidden magic say that this 41-employee start-up has everything we've come to expect from Silicon Valley: a daring business plan, innovative technology and entrepreneurs prone to breathless superlatives when discussing their new offering's possible impact on the world.
''This is something that is going to alter the landscape,'' boasts Tony Miranz, Vudu's founder, of the product he plans to begin selling this summer. ''We are rewriting economics.'' 
 Vudu, if all goes as planned, hopes to turn America's televisions into limitless multiplexes, providing instant gratification for movie buffs. It has built a small Internet-ready movie box that connects to the television and allows couch potatoes to rent or buy any of the 5,000 films now in Vudu's growing collection. The box's biggest asset is raw speed: the company says the films will begin playing immediately after a customer makes a selection.
 If Vudu succeeds, it may mean goodbye to laborious computer downloads, sticky-floored movie theaters and cable companies' much narrower video-on-demand offerings. It may even mean a fond farewell to the DVD itself -- the profit engine of the film industry for the last decade. ''Other forms of movie distribution are going to look silly and uncompetitive by comparison,'' Mr. Miranz asserts.
 It is not only Vudu's disciples who are zealous about the company's prospects. Every major studio -- except, for now, Sony Pictures Entertainment -- and 15 smaller ones will make their films available on Vudu. And film executives largely wax adulatory when speaking about Vudu. Jim Rosenthal, president of the New Line Television division of Time Warner, says Vudu addresses ''the two major issues that people think are getting in way of the growth of digital distribution: they are getting movies onto the television, and they are doing it in a way that consumers don't have to sit there for two hours waiting.''
 Despite such high praise, Vudu faces hurdles. It is wading into a field dominated by heavyweights whose own aggressive efforts to kindle movie downloading over the Internet have largely failed. There is also little proof that consumers care much about the wide selection or instant availability of movies downloaded from the Web, especially if a movie isn't cheaper than buying a DVD.
 Vudu also needs to persuade regular folks to drag another whirring, electricity-guzzling gizmo into their already-crowded living rooms. ''Three hundred dollars for the privilege of paying another 6 or 10 for a movie is a high hurdle,'' said Nicholas Donatiello Jr., chief executive of the market research firm Odyssey. ''Americans do not want more boxes under their TV if they can avoid it.''
 Even with such challenges, however, Hollywood itself says Vudu represents a real breakthrough. 
 ''The first time I ever saw TiVo was an a-ha moment, and this was the same thing,'' says Jim Wuthrich, a senior executive with Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Group. ''It looks fairly sexy and inviting. This is going to pull people in.''
 VUDU is arriving at a time of rapid change in the entertainment and media landscapes. This year, for the first time, a majority of American homes will have a broadband connection to the Web, according to iSuppli, a research firm. That benchmark has reshuffled the cards in the media and entertainment industries. 
 With versatile data pipes now reaching into most homes, the deep thinkers in Hollywood and Silicon Valley say they believe that television shows and movies -- just like e-mail, Web pages, songs and albums -- will one day be cheaply and efficiently imported into the home. 
 The question is when. 
 For all of their confidence, the new ventures now crowding the digital video launching pad look, if anything, a tad sickly. YouTube, which Google bought last year for $1.65 billion, is an exception: it has attracted millions of users fanatical about watching bite-sized video clips. But services offering longer video content have yet to get much traction.
 The Web sites Movielink and CinemaNow have allowed consumers to download feature-length films to their personal computers for the last five years. Few viewers have chosen to, partly because the pinched PC screen is a lousy place to watch movies. Over the last 15 months, similar movie downloading services for the PC have started from such varied sources as Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, Google, BitTorrent and the Starz movie channel of Liberty Media. Bowing to the copyright anxieties of Hollywood, all of these companies encrust their digital media files with cumbersome copyright protection software that often foils computers and frustrates users.
 ''Consumers want choice and control, but for long-form video like movies on the PC that is not enough,'' said Mr. Donatiello at Odyssey. ''You have to get the content to the television.''
 Steve Jobs, at least, understands that. Apple, which has the most successful movie downloading effort so far on iTunes -- offering just 500 films from two major studios -- began selling a device called Apple TV last month. Priced at $299, the box wirelessly draws movies, TV shows and music from the computer to the television. 
 The people at Vudu seem particularly wary of Apple TV: they have bought two to test. But they are betting that movie downloads will ultimately be free from an awkward dependence on the computer, and they think that this could happen sooner than anyone else expects. 
 ''This shift can look very slow in the beginning and very sudden at some moment in the future,'' says Alain Rossmann, a Silicon Valley veteran and the chairman of Vudu. ''That is the history of technology.''
 A graduate of the Ecole Polytechnique, the engineering school in France, Mr. Rossmann worked on the original Macintosh for Apple in the 1980s before starting four Silicon Valley companies over the following 20 years. The last, a software start-up named Phone.com later renamed OpenWave Systems, established a standard for how early cellphones wirelessly connected to the Internet.
 Mr. Rossmann left Phone.com in 2001, and three years later one of his former colleagues came to him with an idea. Mr. Miranz, 43, an energetic and persuasive former vice president at OpenWave, started thinking about downloading movies over the Internet after his wife grew frustrated at her inability to find the 1980 miniseries ''Marco Polo'' at a nearby Blockbuster. Signing up for Netflix and waiting for DVDs to arrive in the mail, he said, ''seemed like settling for a meal of worms in the desert.''
 Over the summer of 2004, Mr. Miranz and Mr. Rossmann began discussing a digital download service, and soon watched the first generation of downloading stores beat them online. But they agreed that a truly mainstream movie service would need to originate on the television, not the computer. Mr. Miranz said he was also ''obsessed with the idea of instantaneousness'' -- the notion that consumers, sitting in front of the television, could click a button and play a film without delay, as if a disc were in the DVD player. 
 Mr. Rossmann approached that challenge mathematically. Sending each ordered movie from a central facility over the Web, he reasoned, would become more expensive the more popular such a service became. Instead, he concluded, peer-to-peer networking -- the idea of passing files, or pieces of files, between users -- was the most economical and efficient solution. 
 That technology was behind renegade file-trading bazaars like the early manifestations of Napster and Grokster, that were the bane of the entertainment industries. But it also underlies a new wave of legal Internet video services like Joost and Kontiki.
 From 2004 to 2006, Mr. Miranz's and Mr. Rossmann's newly formed company -- which first went by the name Vvond, and later Marquee -- filed 42 patent applications sketching the principles of an Internet movie network that would keep consumers where they belonged: rooted to their living-room couch. 
 The system, according to interviews and those patent applications, will operate like a traditional peer-to-peer service, but without any active participation by users. Vudu boxes that already have a certain movie on their hard drives -- say, ''The Godfather'' -- will send pieces of that movie to a nearby box when its owner suddenly gets a taste for the epic Mafia drama.
 But to get those movies playing quickly, the Vudu engineers struck upon another notion: using a slice of the digital real estate on each Vudu box to store the beginning portions of each film. They also delved into the science of predictions. When the company determines that a movie is more likely to be rented or purchased -- early in its release, for example -- it will plant lengthier pieces of that film on unused portions of Vudu boxes in customer homes. 
 Rajeev Motwani, a computer science professor at Stanford who worked with the Google founders when they were doctoral students, reviewed Vudu's early plans. ''It's so clever that in hindsight it seems like the obvious thing to do,'' he says.
 By mid-2005, after raising $21 million from two Valley venture capital firms, Greylock Partners and Benchmark Capital, Vudu was ready to begin designing the box itself. Mr. Rossmann said he advised Mr. Miranz to ''get some DNA from the company with the closest experience to what we are going through: TiVo.''
 TiVo's set-top boxes have snared a passionate audience over the last decade by offering time-saving utility with a simple user interface. Vudu hired 11 TiVo veterans to help steer product design and manufacture its box. That left Vudu in need of content deals with studios -- a challenge that fell to Mr. Miranz, whose ambition and taste for deal-making were suited to Hollywood.
 During his first year of regular trips to Los Angeles, Mr. Miranz found the going tough; Mr. Rossmann regularly called from his vacation home in France to express concern over the lack of progress. 
 But by 2006, Mr. Miranz recalled, the tide had turned Vudu's way. DVD sales began to stagnate because studios had finally plowed through their entire backlog of movies that could be released on the shiny discs. The success of iTunes was also proving that the digital transition was inevitable and that one powerful player, Apple, could control the market if Hollywood did not find other viable partners. And outlaw services like the pirate Web sites that use BitTorrent technology demonstrated that digital piracy, which had consumed the music business first, now posed a real problem for Hollywood.
 The studios were suddenly very ready to talk. Ron Lamprecht, the senior vice president for digital distribution at NBC Universal, which signed the first deal with Vudu in May 2006, said he was enamored by the relative simplicity and intuitive user interface of the company's box. Universal also liked the system's security. Vudu's devices use the same encryption technology inside a cable or satellite box, and Hollywood's valuable film assets never have to cross the PC screens, where they typically become exposed to the predations of hackers. 
 ''The platform is secure from the moment we provide them content to the moment it shows up in the box,'' Mr. Lamprecht said.
 With Universal on board, Mr. Miranz signed up Fox, Disney, Warner Brothers and Paramount over the last year. ''It's always nice to see the entire industry getting behind a format,'' said Thomas Lesinksi, president of Paramount Pictures Digital Entertainment, noting the industry rift over high-definition DVD technology. ''When that happens, it has a much higher chance of success.''
 Edward Lichty, who left TiVo last year and is now Vudu's chief operating officer, says the company is ''not expecting to be a mass product out of the gate.'' But its peer network can be run so cheaply, he says, that it needs to have only modest success selling its box, which should retail for around $300. (A final price has not yet been set.) The company can also someday add television shows, music and video games to its service. 
 Vudu executives even consider the possibility that their hardware box might eventually melt away, with its services running as the video-on-demand feature in a satellite box, video game console or a new breed of high-definition televisions. 
 BUT can the little company with big plans even get that far?
 In addition to Apple TV, Vudu has to face off against Microsoft's gaming console, Xbox 360, which lets users download movies and TV shows. Other technology heavyweights such as Yahoo, Google and Cisco are no doubt also contemplating how to get Internet video onto television. Even Netflix, which built a DVD rental business via mail premised on the idea that movies delivered online were a long way off, is thinking about it. It recently hired a founder of ReplayTV -- an early rival to TiVo -- inviting speculation that it, too, was working on a movie box for the television.
 In an interview, Reed Hastings, a founder of Netflix, said he recently met with Vudu to learn more about the company. He would not discuss details of the meeting other than to say: ''It's an open question whether Vudu makes an impact on the world or not -- but either way it is emblematic of the Internet innovation wave beginning to wash over television sets everywhere.''

HEADLINE: The Divisions That Tighten the Purse Strings

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
MANY Americans are skeptical about government spending on social programs, and they cite a litany of familiar reasons: big government programs aren't effective, they are vulnerable to waste and abuse, and they run counter to the libertarian, self-reliant spirit of the nation's founders. 
 But a growing body of research suggests that America's antipathy toward big government has another, less-often-acknowledged underpinning: the nation's racial and ethnic diversity.
Recent studies by economists and other social scientists have found that this mix tends to undermine support for government spending on ''public goods'' of all types, whether health care, roads or welfare programs for the disadvantaged. 
 Some of these studies suggest that America's rich diversity -- not only ethnic and racial but also religious and linguistic -- goes a long way toward explaining why government spending on social welfare programs is much lower than it is in the more homogeneous nations of Europe. Other studies have found that within the United States, local support for various types of public spending falls as diversity rises. 
 ''Racial divisions and ethnic divisions reduce incentives for people to be generous to others through social welfare,'' said Alberto Alesina, a professor of economics at Harvard. ''This is very unfortunate. But as social scientists, we can't close our eyes to something we don't like.''
 In America, government spending on social transfers -- everything from food stamps and unemployment insurance to health care and pensions -- is about a third less than it is in Italy, France or Belgium, when expressed as a share of the economy, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And it is about half the level of Sweden's. Moreover, Americans pay less in taxes than the citizens of nearly every other wealthy nation in the O.E.C.D.
 In their 2004 book, ''Fighting Poverty in the U.S. and Europe,'' Mr. Alesina and Edward Glaeser, another Harvard economist, applied statistical regression techniques to correlate data on government spending with data on racial, ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity in Western Europe and the United States. The professors concluded that about half the gap between Europe and the United States in public spending on social programs could be explained by America's more varied racial and ethnic mix. (They said that much of the rest resulted from stronger left-wing parties in Europe.) 
 As William Julius Wilson suggested in his 1996 book, ''When Work Disappears: the World of the New Urban Poor,'' many white Americans turned against spending on welfare during the 1970s because they thought that it mostly served blacks. ''White taxpayers saw themselves as being forced, through taxes, to pay for medical and legal services that many of them could not afford for their own families,'' Mr. Wilson wrote.
 In the relative homogeneity of Sweden, by contrast, most taxpayers are confident that social spending programs will be directed to people much like themselves. 
 This doesn't mean Americans are stingy. In fact, they contribute much more than Europeans to charity, selecting who they want to help. ''It's not that Americans are bad guys,'' Mr. Glaeser said. ''They just want to target it.''
 But in drawing on a wide range of data like population surveys and patterns of municipal spending, researchers have found ample evidence of how ethnic and racial diversity has undermined support for spending on social welfare in the United States.
 In a study in 2001, Erzo F. P. Luttmer, an associate professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, reported that the percentage of people who say they support welfare spending decreases as the share of local recipients from their own racial group falls. His report was based on data from the General Social Survey, a social-attitudes poll conducted across the United States nearly every year since 1972.
 In another study, published in 1996, James Poterba, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that public spending on education falls as the percentage of elderly people in a given area rises. The reduction, he found, ''is particularly large when the elderly residents and the school-age population are from different racial groups.''
 In a 1997 study, Mr. Alesina, along with Reza Baqir, an economist at the International Monetary Fund, and William Easterly, an economics professor at New York University, looked at the relationship between social spending and ethnic diversity in 2,700 cities, counties and metropolitan areas across the United States.
 They found that in more diverse cities and counties, the share of local government spending on public goods -- in this case, roads, sewage treatment, trash clearance and education -- was generally lower than it was in more homogeneous localities. ''Our results are consistent with the idea that white majorities vote to reduce the supply of productive public goods as the share of blacks and other minorities increases,'' they wrote.
 Of course, there are some exceptions to the pattern. New York and California, for instance, are among the most highly taxed and most diverse states, although there is evidence that racial and ethnic tensions have whittled away at support for public spending. In California, to cite just one example, Proposition 187, barring illegal immigrants from access to public services, passed in 1994 on the support of 63 percent of whites, despite the opposition of four of every five Latinos.
 New York's history also has examples of ethnic tensions. But New York City, in a way, is a special case: so diverse that no single ethnic or racial majority controls the public purse. ''There is no cleavage between an Anglo majority and some poor minority,'' Mr. Glaeser said. ''In New York, everybody is a minority.''
 New York City's experience, in fact, underscores that diversity does not automatically lead to hostility among ethnic groups or toward government spending as a whole. From public education to intermarriage to the many institutions in civil society promoting mutual understanding, there are countervailing forces acting to overcome ethnic, religious or linguistic cleavages.
 Ethnic diversity doesn't inevitably reduce spending on public goods. Rather, spending tends to fall when elected officials choose to run and govern on platforms that heighten racial and ethnic divisions. Over the long term, governments usually find it in their interest to bridge the centrifugal forces of diversity rather than to exploit them, if only to promote stability. 
 STILL, there is little reason to believe that the racial, ethnic, religious and linguistic antagonisms that have eroded support for social welfare programs in the United States are likely to abate any time soon. Indeed, the arrival of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants a year from Latin America seems to be sapping support for public welfare.
 Last year, laws were enacted in Arizona, Colorado, Rhode Island and Hawaii barring illegal immigrants from access to some government programs. This month, the State Senate in Oklahoma overwhelmingly passed legislation that would bar illegal immigrants from receiving public benefits. 
 And these restrictive attitudes can easily turn against spending on domestic programs as a whole. Representative Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Republican running for president on an anti-immigration platform, says that Americans pay too much in taxes and that the Internal Revenue Service should be abolished. His candidacy may not prosper, but the issues on which he is running are likely to be around for some time. 
 Mr. Alesina certainly expects further conflicts. ''One can expect public support for public goods to erode further,'' he said. ''Public spending in law and order might not go down. What would go down is spending on redistribution.''

HEADLINE: At Milepost 1 on the Hydrogen Highway

BYLINE: By DON SHERMAN

 BODY:
ANY discussion of a future generation of hydrogen cars inevitably leads to the same question: Where will I fill the tank?
 While automakers have demonstrated that they can build vehicles that produce no tailpipe pollutants, the commercial availability of hydrogen to power them remains a showstopper. There are other issues, of course -- the cost of fuel cells and the methods of storing hydrogen among them -- but matters like driveability and safety are no longer impediments to retail introduction.
Still, proponents promise a future of placid (and carbon-free) travel punctuated by occasional stops to replenish the tanks as conveniently as we fill them today. They champion an America laced by a hydrogen highway, dotted with service stations offering safe, affordable refueling. 
 Their vision is more than an idealistic pipe dream. President Bush has been talking up hydrogen for four years; the Energy Department has set a goal for hydrogen to provide 10 percent of the nation's energy needs by 2030; and Samuel W. Bodman, the secretary of energy, recently doled out research grants worth $8.2 million aimed at expanding hydrogen storage capacity.
 Today, every major vehicle maker is studying alternatives to gasoline with the goal of supplanting hydrocarbons with hydrogen. 
 So far, the only hydrogen fueling stations in service are prototypes built to foster research. Hydrogen tankers are not an everyday sight on American highways, and the hydrogen production plants needed to slake America's nearly insatiable thirst for portable energy have not been built. The hydrogen highway is not yet a county byway, let alone an Interstate. But it is more than a dirt path through the woods.
 Hydrogen is at least a global commodity: 50 million tons of this industrial gas are produced every year around the world. More than half of that is used to make ammonia, a component of fertilizer, cleaning products and medicines. It is also a constituent of methanol, an important ingredient in paint, antifreeze and formaldehyde. 
 The surprising slice of the global hydrogen pie is the 14 million tons -- more than 25 percent of annual production -- consumed by oil companies. Hydrogen is a cozy bedfellow with petroleum: hydrogen is both an ingredient in the refining processes used to upgrade the quality of crude oil and a byproduct of oil refineries. It is collected for on-site use, but that source is not enough to meet the needs of refiners. 
 Hydrogen can be transported from centralized plants by pipeline or tank truck, but a more practical option is manufacturing it on-site by a process known as steam reforming, which separates the hydrogen from natural gas. Used to produce 95 percent of the hydrogen supply for the United States, steam reforming is a cost-effective means of sustaining the oil business, but not a viable way to energize a hydrogen economy. 
 One downside to steam reforming is the amount of carbon dioxide it generates -- 350 million tons a year, according to the Energy Department. One possible way to offset that undesirable addition to the atmosphere is sequestration, collecting the carbon dioxide and storing it in the ocean or the ground. This plan shows some promise, but not on the scale required to support a hydrogen-powered future.
 Distribution is another issue. Hydrogen pipelines already exist in California, Texas and Europe -- but they total fewer than 1,000 miles. While it is possible to deliver hydrogen in pipes used for natural gas, a well-known risk is hydrogen embrittlement -- the tendency of hydrogen atoms to infiltrate the surface of welded or heat-treated steel, which can result in cracks and leaks.
 Hydrogen proponents offer near- and long-term solutions to these concerns. Researchers at G.M. propose building pilot hydrogen-making facilities that follow the lead of electric power plants now in use, using local resources: Larry Burns, G.M.'s vice president for research and development, proposes what he calls hydrogen pathways keyed to existing natural resources. He envisions hydrogen produced from natural gas in Rhode Island, coal in West Virginia and hydroelectric power in Idaho. 
 ''The refueling points necessary to support the first million fuel-cell vehicles could be built for $10 billion to $15 billion, which is half the cost of the Alaska pipeline,'' Mr. Burns said. ''That sum would establish a network of 11,700 stations. Seventy percent of the U.S. population would be within two miles of a station.'' 
 Meeting the Bush administration's goal of replacing fossil fuels with hydrogen would require nearly 90 million tons of the gas a year, according to the Energy Department. Coal and natural gas are possible sources only if they can be processed without spewing greenhouse gases. Biomass -- agricultural crops processed with steam reforming -- also has potential if the carbon dioxide byproducts can be contained. 
 Electricity from solar cells and wind turbines can also be used to electrolyze water to hydrogen and oxygen without undesirable byproducts, though it would be a considerable undertaking. The Energy Department estimates that meeting the country's needs with wind power would require more than 160,000 two-megawatt turbines. 
 Advanced nuclear energy may be a more attractive option. The Energy Department is promoting a Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative aimed at demonstrating the commercial feasibility of new nuclear plants that produce hydrogen using high-temperature electrolysis processes. 
 One proposal for vehicles -- reforming gasoline or methanol on board rather than waiting for a hydrogen supply network to be built -- is so complex that it has sent automakers back to their research labs. 
 Clearly, the hydrogen highway will be a toll road, not a low-cost thoroughfare. All of these technologies, and probably others yet to be discovered, will be required to energize a hydrogen future. But Americans can take solace in this: The journey to a clean, secure and possibly more efficient future has begun.

HEADLINE: For $82 a Day, Booking a Cell In a 5-Star Jail

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., April 25 

 BODY:
Anyone convicted of a crime knows a debt to society often must be paid in jail. But a slice of Californians willing to supplement that debt with cash (no personal checks, please) are finding that the time can be almost bearable. 
 For offenders whose crimes are usually relatively minor (carjackers should not bother) and whose bank accounts remain lofty, a dozen or so city jails across the state offer pay-to-stay upgrades. Theirs are a clean, quiet, if not exactly recherche alternative to the standard county jails, where the walls are bars, the fellow inmates are hardened and privileges are few.
Many of the self-pay jails operate like secret velvet-roped nightclubs of the corrections world. You have to be in the know to even apply for entry, and even if the court approves your sentence there, jail administrators can operate like bouncers, rejecting anyone they wish. 
 ''I am aware that this is considered to be a five-star Hilton,'' said Nicole Brockett, 22, who was recently booked into one of the jails, here in Orange County about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and paid $82 a day to complete a 21-day sentence for a drunken driving conviction. 
 Ms. Brockett, who in her oversize orange T-shirt and flip-flops looked more like a contestant on ''The Real World'' than an inmate, shopped around for the best accommodations, travel-ocity.com-style.
 ''It's clean here,'' she said, perched in a jail day room on the sort of couch found in a hospital emergency room. ''It's safe and everyone here is really nice. I haven't had a problem with any of the other girls. They give me shampoo.''
 For roughly $75 to $127 a day, these convicts -- who are known in the self-pay parlance as ''clients'' -- get a small cell behind a regular door, distance of some amplitude from violent offenders and, in some cases, the right to bring an iPod or computer on which to compose a novel, or perhaps a song.
 Many of the overnighters are granted work furlough, enabling them to do most of their time on the job, returning to the jail simply to go to bed (often following a strip search, which granted is not so five-star).
 The clients usually share a cell, but otherwise mix little with the ordinary nonpaying inmates, who tend to be people arrested and awaiting arraignment, or federal prisoners on trial or awaiting deportation and simply passing through.
 The pay-to-stay programs have existed for years, but recently attracted some attention when prosecutors balked at a jail in Fullerton that they said would offer computer and cellphone use to George Jaramillo, a former Orange County assistant sheriff who pleaded no contest to perjury and misuse of public funds, including the unauthorized use of a county helicopter. Mr. Jaramillo was booked into the self-pay program in Montebello, near Los Angeles, instead.
 ''We certainly didn't envision a jail with cellphone and laptop capabilities where his family could bring him three hot meals,'' said Susan Kang Schroeder, the public affairs counsel for the Orange County district attorney. ''We felt that the use of the computer was part of the instrumentality of his crime, and that is another reason we objected to that.''
 A spokesman for the Fullerton jail said cellphones but not laptops were allowed.
 While jails in other states may offer pay-to-stay programs, numerous jail experts said they did not know of any.
 ''I have never run into this,'' said Ken Kerle, managing editor of the publication American Jail Association and author of two books on jails. ''But the rest of the country doesn't have Hollywood either. Most of the people who go to jail are economically disadvantaged, often mentally ill, with alcohol and drug problems and are functionally illiterate. They don't have $80 a day for jail.''
 The California prison system, severely overcrowded, teeming with violence and infectious diseases and so dysfunctional that much of it is under court supervision, is one that anyone with the slightest means would most likely pay to avoid.
 ''The benefits are that you are isolated and you don't have to expose yourself to the traditional county system,'' said Christine Parker, a spokeswoman for CSI, a national provider of jails that runs three in Orange County with pay-to-stay programs. ''You can avoid gang issues. You are restricted in terms of the number of people you are encountering and they are a similar persuasion such as you.''
 Most of the programs -- which offer 10 to 30 beds -- stay full enough that marketing is not necessary, though that was not always the case. The Pasadena jail, for instance, tried to create a little buzz for its program when it was started in the early 1990s. 
 ''Our sales pitch at the time was, 'Bad things happen to good people,' '' said Janet Givens, a spokeswoman for the Pasadena Police Department. Jail representatives used Rotary Clubs and other such venues as their potential marketplace for ''fee-paying inmate workers'' who are charged $127 a day (payment upfront required).
 ''People might have brothers, sisters, cousins, etc., who might have had a lapse in judgment and do not want to go to county jail,'' Ms. Givens said.
 The typical pay-to-stay client, jail representatives agreed, is a man in his late 30s who has been convicted of driving while intoxicated and sentenced to a month or two in jail.
 But there are single-night guests, and those who linger well over a year.
 ''One individual wanted to do four years here,'' said Christina Holland, a correctional manager of the Santa Ana jail. 
 Inmates in Santa Ana who have been approved for pay to stay by the courts and have coughed up a hefty deposit for their stay, enter the jail through a lobby and not the driveway reserved for the arrival of other prisoners. They are strip searched when they return from work each day because the biggest problem they pose is the smuggling of contraband, generally cigarettes, for nonpaying inmates. 
 Most of the jailers require the inmates to do chores around the jails, even if they work elsewhere during the day.
 ''I try real hard to keep them in custody for 12 hours,'' Ms. Holland said. ''Because I think that's fair.''
 Critics argue that the systems create inherent injustices, offering cleaner, safer alternatives to those who can pay.
 ''It seems to be to be a little unfair,'' said Mike Jackson, the training manager of the National Sheriff's Association. ''Two people come in, have the same offense, and the guy who has money gets to pay to stay and the other doesn't. The system is supposed to be equitable.''
 But cities argue that the paying inmates generate cash, often hundreds of thousands of dollars a year -- enabling them to better afford their other taxpayer-financed operations -- and are generally easy to deal with.
 ''We never had a problem with self pay,'' said Steve Lechuga, the operations manager for CSI. ''I haven't seen any fights in years. We had a really good success rate with them.''
 Stanley Goldman, a professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, has recommended the program to former clients.
 ''The prisoners who are charged with nonviolent crimes and typically have no record are not in the best position to handle themselves in the general county facility,'' Professor Goldman said.
 Still, no doubt about it, the self-pay jails are not to be confused with Canyon Ranch.
 The cells at Santa Ana are roughly the size of a custodial closet, and share its smell and ambience. Most have little more than a pink bottle of jail-issue moisturizer and a book borrowed from the day room. Lockdown can occur for hours at a time, and just feet away other prisoners sit with their faces pressed against cell windows, looking menacing. 
 Ms. Brockett, who normally works as a bartender in Los Angeles, said the experience was one she never cared to repeat.
 ''It does look decent,'' she said, ''but you still feel exactly where you are.''

FREEDOM'S POWER
 The True Force of Liberalism.
 By Paul Starr.
 276 pp. Basic Books. $26.
Since the 1960s, political debate in the United States has been dominated by ideologies of the right: fusionist conservatism, libertarianism, the religious right, neoconservatism. Center-left political thought, when it has not simply rationalized the demands of Democratic Party constituencies, has tended to be academic and remote from politics. In recent years, however, center-left intellectuals including Bruce Ackerman, William Galston, John E. Schwarz and Michael Tomasky have sought to define a body of principles that could inform a practical liberal politics. The newest addition to this literature, Paul Starr's ''Freedom's Power: The True Force of Liberalism,'' is a brilliant and ambitious attempt to provide a public philosophy for 21st-century American liberalism. 
 Starr is a Pulitzer Prize-winning sociologist, a co-founder of The American Prospect and a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton. In ''Freedom's Power,'' he treats American liberalism as a variant of a common Anglo-American liberal tradition stretching from the 17th century to the present. The first phase of the tradition was ''constitutional liberalism,'' whose defining moments were the Glorious Revolution in Britain in 1688 and the American Revolution in 1776. Constitutional liberalism promoted ''the fundamental principles of constitutional government and individual rights shared by modern liberals and conservatives alike, though often differently interpreted by them.'' What Starr calls ''democratic liberalism,'' beginning in the late 19th century, builds on constitutional liberalism while incorporating previously excluded groups like women and minorities, and giving the government an important if limited role in managing industrial capitalism for the benefit of all. ''The relationship between liberalism in these two phases,'' he writes, ''has been predominantly cumulative: while rejecting laissez-faire economic policy, modern democratic liberalism continues to take the broader tradition of constitutional liberalism as its foundation.''
 Starr performs a great service by insisting that Anglo-American democratic liberalism is the left wing of classical liberalism, not, like European social democracy, the right wing of democratic socialism. A self-described liberal hawk who opposed the Iraq war but supported the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and the war in Afghanistan, Starr does an equally great service by putting war and state-making at the center of the history of Anglo-American liberalism, arguing that it is precisely because of their liberalism that liberal states have repeatedly bested autocracies: ''The lesson drawn by the generation of internationalists that followed Wilson was that it was possible to join a realist's grasp of power politics to a liberal vision of international order.''
 ''American liberals do not have to invent something new or import a philosophical tradition from abroad,'' Starr writes. His version of Anglo-American liberalism, however, is as much British as American: 1776 completes 1688, and American Progressives of the 1900s are somewhat less successful versions of their contemporaries and role models, British New Liberals. Starr discusses British politicians like William Gladstone, Joseph Chamberlain, J. A. Hobson and Leonard Hobhouse but does not even mention William Jennings Bryan and needs only a paragraph to dismiss American Populists as irrelevant agrarians.
 Starr prefers the term ''liberal'' to ''progressive,'' which some to the left of center use to evade the stigma that the right has attached to the so-called L-word. Even so, Starr's version of democratic liberalism echoes many themes of early-20th-century American Progressivism, including enthusiasm for professionalism in public administration and journalism. Starr's major policy proposal, a vague ''New Deal for the Young'' or ''Young America program'' resembling the G.I. Bill, is a version of national service, a capital-P Progressive idea going back to William James that has inspired the G.I. Bill, the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps.
 A genealogy of American liberalism that includes upper-middle-class Progressives, civil libertarians, civil rights activists, organized labor and even British New Liberals, while air-brushing American Populists out of the picture, may provide a usable past for the post-1960s liberal coalition, which lost the white working class and rural Americans -- but only at the price of historical accuracy. The 1892 Populist Party platform, which among other things endorsed the progressive income tax and praised organized labor, declared that ''the power of government -- in other words, of the people -- should be expanded ... as rapidly and as far as the good sense of an intelligent people and the teaching of experience shall justify, to the end that oppression, injustice and poverty shall eventually cease in the land.''
 This was nothing if not part of the transition in the United States from laissez-faire constitutional liberalism to the democratic liberalism that Starr defends. He argues persuasively that ''liberalism has no way to advance without a majoritarian politics.'' Whether an American liberalism that disdains populism can create a lasting political majority remains to be seen.
 Still, if details of Starr's grand synthesis can be questioned, his argument for rooting American liberalism in an evolving, centuries-old Anglo-American liberal tradition, rather than in interest-group politics or academic theories, is persuasive. ''Freedom's Power'' is an impressive achievement that deserves to be pondered by the critics of contemporary American liberalism no less than by its supporters.

 BODY:
THE NEW AMERICAN STORY
 By Bill Bradley.
 364 pp. Random House. $25.95.
Whatever happened to Bill Bradley? During his two decades in the Senate, this former Rhodes scholar and star forward for the New York Knicks accumulated an impressive record of accomplishment, particularly on economic issues. Intelligent, collegial and taller than Abe Lincoln, Bradley seemed just about the best the Democrats had to offer. But when he finally sought the presidential nomination, he displayed poor timing. The year, 2000, was inopportune -- his main rival was a sitting vice president with near identical views -- and Bradley lost. After Al Gore locked up the nomination, Bradley kept an indecorously long silence before endorsing him, and about a month before the general election he came out with a book, ''The Journey From Here,'' that was sprinkled with thinly veiled criticisms of his party's standard-bearer. Quite apart from the sour grapes, the book seemed strangely narcissistic. Mere weeks before Election Day, what need had voters for policy pronouncements from a candidate no longer in the race? 
 Now Bradley has written another book, ''The New American Story,'' outlining once again his plan for America. ''I'm outside the political pressure cooker now with no ax to grind and no political ambition to accomplish,'' he explains. ''What's here comes from my soul and from a new sense of freedom.'' But the old Bradley never seemed especially constricted when discussing government policy. He was admirably committed to principle and open to innovative ideas. The new Bradley, meanwhile, is hardly Zorba the Greek. He's a managing director at Allen & Company, a leading investment bank for the entertainment and technology industries. Bradley still writes like a politician -- much of the book has the windy quality of an overlong speech -- and I'm hard pressed to identify many policies he advocates here that he wouldn't have argued for (and in a lot of cases, did argue for) when he depended on voters' good will. Reading ''The New American Story,'' I often found myself wishing I were experiencing Bradley as a presidential candidate rather than as an author, and that's only partly a knock on the book.
 Bradley's conceit is that the country's conservative leaders are telling ''a story about America that simply isn't true.'' He organizes the book's first half around these false narratives, which he recites at a level of extreme generality -- no quotations or attributions -- that allows him to maintain senatorial decorum while enjoying maximum freedom to create straw men (for example, ''What good is it, the story asks, to have the world's strongest military if you never use it?''). Bradley then answers each false narrative with a true narrative that expresses communitarianism, fiscal sobriety, respect for the environment and other social values typically neglected by the right. It's a tedious and somewhat gimmicky construct.
 But books like this aren't really meant to be read. They're meant to be shaken, vigorously, to see what ideas fall to the ground. The best ones here tumble out of the section on the economy. To get the budget deficit under control, Bradley proposes gradually raising the minimum eligibility age for Social Security until the year 2099, when it would be 70 (he recommends a ''narrowly liberalized'' disability benefit for people in their late 60s whose jobs cause health problems that won't permit them to keep working). This is more than justified, he notes correctly, by the rise in average life expectancy (from 61 years to 78) in the seven decades since Social Security was introduced. Bradley has advocated this reform since his Senate days, but backed away from it during his presidential run when Gore used it to attack him.
 Bradley also argues plausibly that it's time to close tax loopholes for the rich in exchange for a modest reduction in tax rates, as Congress did in 1986. This time he suggests capping tax subsidies for those who own a home, give to charity, buy health insurance and perform other activities the government wants to encourage, so that these subsidies don't benefit the wealthy disproportionately. The largely unregulated hedge-fund tycoons who've become this decade's avatars of highflying wealth should, Bradley urges, be restricted in their access to pension funds and required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Before hedge funds took off, he writes, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board could calm the financial markets by phoning ''the key players.'' Today the Fed chairman lacks the means to know who many of those players even are.
 Bradley has little to offer on the country's most vexing problem, the mess in Iraq. He calls the war ''the most serious foreign policy blunder I have seen in my lifetime'' and says we should end it. But his sole elaboration is ''Leaving has fewer long-term downsides than staying.'' This is the book's most glaring example of how the ''new sense of freedom'' Bradley enjoys in his post-political life, far from lending greater frankness to his pronouncements, enables greater avoidance. Were he running for president, he would be forced to detail when and how the troops should withdraw, what the likely consequences would be and how America should confront them.
 On the other hand, Bradley the noncandidate is now willing to recognize as a ''potential approach'' to the health care crisis what he calls Medicare for All -- that is, socialized medicine. When he was a presidential candidate, he maintained the fiction that private insurance had a necessary role to play in a truly reformed health care system -- a fiction that continues to demand deference from today's major presidential candidates, mounting evidence to the contrary. Otherwise, candidate Bradley's health care plan was admirably ambitious -- and, he complains, grievously misunderstood. The plan's complexity made it ''prey to artful distortion,'' allowing the ''opposing campaign'' to exaggerate its potential costs and the risk that it would shortchange ''the most vulnerable citizens.'' Incredibly, Dollar Bill is still sulking about the fouls Gore committed seven years ago. He'd have forgotten them by now, if only he'd stayed in the game.

HEADLINE: For Colt and His Owner, a Long Ride to the Derby

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
Elizabeth Valando was bundled in fur and looked as if she were at Sardi's awaiting the opening-night reviews of a Broadway show. Instead, she stood shivering in the paddock of Aqueduct racetrack watching her trainer, Barclay Tagg, saddle a colt she had fallen for when he was a spindly-legged foal in the Kentucky bluegrass.
 Behind her serene smile, Mrs. Valando, 82, was a wreck. The colt that she had bred was heading onto the track on April 7 for the Wood Memorial, a race that could send them to the 133rd Kentucky Derby.
When the colt was born, Jan. 29, 2004, he faced improbable odds of securing one of the 20 post positions for the Derby. 
 He was, after all, one of 34,642 thoroughbreds foaled in the United States in 2004, and Mrs. Valando was just another owner with the first Saturday in May 2007 circled in her fantasies. By 2006, the colt was one of 10,390 from that crop to make it to the racetrack. Now, as a 3-year-old, he is one of 450 horses, including 27 from outside the United States, nominated for the Triple Crown races: the Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes.
 The pursuit of a Derby champion has humbled people like George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees; the television impresario Merv Griffin; and a who's who of business titans. Last year, horse owners spent more than $1.26 billion at North American thoroughbred auctions.
 Still, when Mr. Tagg, a pessimist by nature, saw Mrs. Valando's bay colt with the white blaze between his eyes for the first time, he said, ''If this isn't a Triple Crown horse, I don't know what one looks like.'' 
 Mr. Tagg knew something about champions as the trainer of the 2003 Derby and Preakness winner, Funny Cide.
 Mrs. Valando called her colt Nobiz Like Shobiz, a name that she had been saving to honor her husband, Tommy, a music publisher and Broadway show backer. Like a Member of the Family 
 Last September, when Nobiz raced for the first time, he seemed to float to a 10 3/4-length victory, which brought a visit from a representative of Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. He made an offer that was hard to refuse: $17 million for Nobiz.
 But Mrs. Valando did refuse. Like Roy and Gretchen Jackson, the owners of Barbaro, who won last year's Derby and was fatally injured in the Preakness, Mrs. Valando had a special relationship with her horse.
 ''You're not supposed to fall in love with these animals,'' she said. ''Nobiz is like a member of the family. I cannot sell one of them off.
 ''I want him to go to Kentucky, but I want him to go with a chance to win. I don't think people understand what a feat it is to get to the Derby, about how much you endure to get there.''
 In 1991, the Valandos had another good horse, Fly So Free. He was the 2-year-old champion and won 7 of 10 starts. He finished fifth in the Derby. They were hooked.
 When her husband of 32 years died in 1995, Mrs. Valando, a former singer, continued to breed horses. She has eight broodmares in Kentucky and races two or three horses at a time. By breeding her mare Nightstorm with the sire Albert the Great for a modest $7,500, Mrs. Valando produced Nobiz.
 On March 1, two days before the Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park in Florida, Mr. Tagg could be forgiven for believing Nobiz was on a path to greatness. In four races, he had lost once, by less than a length, to the accomplished Scat Daddy in the Champagne Stakes last October. Nobiz turned in a flawless workout, and Mr. Tagg ticked off his plan. 
 ''I'd like to win this race really easily,'' he said. ''I'd like to go to the Wood Memorial and win that race really easily. I'd like to go to the Kentucky Derby and win that race really easily.'' 
 Derrick Sturniolo, Nobiz's exercise rider, nicknamed him Junior and talked to him as if he were a brother. Mr. Sturniolo, who raced inexpensive horses for small purses at Midwest tracks, had never been close to such a talented thoroughbred. He marveled at Nobiz's economy of motion, how the colt made him feel like a hummingbird atop a jet. 
 ''Most of the time, these babies, with all their muscle and talent, can be a little mean or nervous,'' he said, stroking Nobiz's nose. ''But Junior here is two different horses. He's all business on the racetrack. But he's a big old love bug in the barn.''
 Even Mr. Tagg could find little to worry about when it came to Nobiz. At 69, his face is unlined, and he has the lithe build of a dancer. Mr. Tagg, however, blends a barbed sense of humor with exasperation that betrays too many hard years. 
 After the success of Funny Cide, Mr. Tagg's stable grew to more than 60 horses, nowhere near the hundreds trained by those who top the earnings list. 
 ''I don't think it hurt me any, but you know it wasn't like everybody is knocking down my door to give me horses,'' he said. ''I had some owners come back that had been with me before. But they might have come back anyway.'' 
 Mrs. Valando was one of the owners who returned. In the late 1990s, he had trained a few of her horses, including Nightstorm. They did not have much luck, so she did what owners often do: moved on to another trainer, first Todd Pletcher, then Carl Nafzger. Mr. Pletcher has a record-tying five horses pointed to the Derby starting gate, and Mr. Nafzger will saddle Street Sense, last year's 2-year-old champion.
 At Mr. Tagg's barn at Gulfstream, the days begin at 5 a.m. Saddles are waxed to a shine, bridles glimmer and the horses' legs are enveloped in spotless white bandages. Mr. Tagg and his assistant and companion, Robin Smullen, rub the horses, dispense ice and examine the animals throughout the day.
 ''He's very antidrugs,'' Mrs. Valando said, noting one of the qualities that brought her back to Mr. Tagg. ''What you see is what you get.''
 She was also pleased by his reaction to her refusal of the sheik's offer for Nobiz, and a $500,000 commission for Mr. Tagg.
 ''I didn't go into this business for the money,'' he told her. 
 Nor is Mrs. Valando, who has refused to insure Nobiz because she does not want to profit from any injury. Getting Serious With Funny Cide 
 Mr. Tagg said that another Derby victory is out there for him, and hinted that he should have captured his first one sooner. 
 He spoke of Funny Cide as if he were speaking about himself. They were the wrong-side-of-the-tracks winners. He was a little-known horseman, Funny Cide a modest New York-bred gelding. The owners were a consortium of everymen, including six middle-aged high school buddies from Sackets Harbor, N.Y.
 Despite winning the first two legs of the Triple Crown and the Jockey Club Gold Cup the next year, Funny Cide has been underappreciated, Mr. Tagg said.
 ''He won stakes every year of his life except as a 5-year-old,'' he said. ''He won a graded stake as a 6-year-old. No Kentucky Derby winner has ever done that before. And everybody still knocks him and knocks me.'' 
 Now 7, Funny Cide remains in Mr. Tagg's barn even though his best racing days are probably over. 
 ''He's happy as hell out there,'' Mr. Tagg said. ''He loves to gallop. He loves to breeze, and he loves the training. He loves to go out and roll in the sand in the afternoon, buck and kick and bray.''
 Funny Cide used to be in the No. 1 stall, but he was moved next door to make room for Nobiz. 
 Last year, Mr. Tagg paid attention to the way Michael Matz trained Barbaro at the Fair Hill Training Center in Maryland, where each had a barn. 
 ''He had the most fabulous horse anybody's seen in a long time,'' Mr. Tagg said. ''It was a machine.''
 He thought he had a colt as capable as Barbaro. It took 1 minute 49.11 seconds to change his mind.
 That was the time it took for Nobiz to finish third behind Scat Daddy and Stormello in the Fountain of Youth. He lost by half a length, but it was the way he finished that worried Mr. Tagg.
 As the field turned for home, jockey Cornelio Velasquez had Nobiz comfortable and in striking range. When Velasquez asked Nobiz to find his finishing gear, it was not there. Scat Daddy surged past in the final 50 yards. When Nobiz found his stride, it was too late.
 In the days that followed, Mr. Tagg watched replays of the race and figured that Nobiz was just immature. He had two months, and one more race, to grow up.
 On March 20, Mr. Tagg sent Nobiz to the track alongside Funny Cide, to get Nobiz used to being challenged in close quarters. 
 The two went five furlongs in a blistering pace. It was difficult to tell the old pro who had won more than $3.5 million from the inexperienced colt.
 ''I wanted to work him in company, and there aren't many I could send with him other than Funny Cide,'' Mr. Tagg said. Tinkering to Victory 
 Six days later, Nobiz worked well in tandem again. Still, Mr. Tagg was not done tinkering. 
 For the Wood Memorial, Nobiz wore blinkers to force him to focus on the racetrack. He also had his ears stuffed with cotton to block out the crowd noise. 
 Either Nobiz was going to run himself into the Kentucky Derby or he was not. Mr. Tagg wondered whether the colt who had always looked the part of a Triple Crown champion was going to act like one.
 That was an excruciating afternoon for Mrs. Valando. She had lunch with friends and relatives in the Trustees Room of Aqueduct, a far cry from Sardi's on opening night, though the tension was about the same. 
 If Nobiz performed well, they were going to Churchill Downs. Mrs. Valando seemed to be barely breathing as Nobiz took the lead into the final turn. He beat back the challenge of the highly regarded Any Given Saturday as they hit the stretch. Then Nobiz stayed straight and true, winning by half a length over the late-running Sightseeing. 
 Mr. Tagg looked relieved. Mrs. Valando was drained and exhausted. In the weeks since, she has been battling bronchitis and an ulcer at her home in Greenwich, Conn.
 She will be at the Derby on Saturday, however, with a horse that she bred and believed in. Beating the Odds 
 Articles in this series are examining the preparation of horses and the motivation of owners and trainers who are striving to win the Kentucky Derby on Saturday.

HEADLINE: In Michigan, Not Even the Dead Are Safe

BYLINE: By Thomas Lynch. 
Thomas Lynch, a funeral director, is the author, most recently, of ''Booking Passage.''

DATELINE: Milford, Mich. 

 BODY:
THE big cemetery with the name like a golf course out on the Interstate across from the mall was seized by a state conservator this winter. Seems someone took the money -- $70 million in prepaid trust funds -- and ran. It's one of those theme park enterprises with lawn crypts and cheap statuary and an army of telemarketers calling up locals in the middle of dinner to sell us all our ''commemorative estates.'' 
 ''You don't want to be a burden to your children, do you?'' So says the ''memorial counselor'' with the sales pitch and the flip chart and the forms to ''sign here'' on the bottom line -- the bargain-in-the-briefcase peace of mind. Why not? I say, though never out loud. My children have all been burdens to me. Isn't that what the best of life is -- bearing our burdens honorably? 
What is known for certain is that an Oklahoman with oil interests conspired to buy Michigan's largest consortium of graveyards from a local lawyer who'd bought them from a Canadian mergers-and-acquisitions company that went belly-up in the late 1990s for all of the usual reasons.
 According to Michigan's attorney general, Mike Cox, the Oklahoman, Clayton Smart, took over 28 Michigan cemeteries in August 2004 from the lawyer, Craig Bush. Over the next couple of months, Messrs. Smart and Bush allegedly managed to remove the millions that luckless consumers had prepaid for graves and markers and perpetual care under the none-too-watchful gaze of the state's regulators and auditors, who finally noticed, 18 months later, that the money was gone.
 On Thursday, Mr. Cox announced that Mr. Smart has been charged with 39 felony counts, including racketeering and embezzlement: ''My goals are clear: protect the public interest, secure the operation of these cemeteries, and criminally charge those who are responsible for embezzling this money.''
 The local version of a national cartoon, the ''Smart-and-Bush-scam'' seems a perfect metaphor for life in southeastern lower Michigan -- another of those ''heckuva job'' imbroglios involving robber barons, the fecklessness of government agencies, and better-late-than-never comeuppances. It's a kind of commemorative Enron: the money gone missing while the erstwhile state cemetery commissioner, who was either incompetent, negligent or complicit, gets ''reassigned'' within the Department of Labor and Economic Growth.
 The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments' recent projections on labor and economic growth call for the worst economic forecast of our lifetimes. The news for Detroit automakers goes from bad to worse. Home sales are slumping, unemployment is up, state workers may soon be sent home without pay, and just as we are catching new criminals, we're letting others go because we can't afford to keep state prisons open. 
 Our National Guard units, haggard after multiple deployments, have lost nearly 60 percent of their ready reserve of equipment and personnel, and another local family has just buried a son sent home in a closed coffin, under the radar, lest anyone see. The flag outside the funeral home is permanently at half-mast and a new crop of presidential candidates are telemarketing now -- dialing for dollars so they can buy airtime to tell us all how, the shape of the planet notwithstanding, they've got a program to make it all better. 
 Out here in Middle America, not even the dead and gone can rest in peace. Still, we pray for peace and carry on. Like politics, all funerals are local.

HEADLINE: The Pack Rat Who Supplies the Scenic Illusion

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
SANTO LOQUASTO is canny with a metaphor. In the first half of ''Our Leading Lady,'' Charles Busch's barbed sendup of show business, he framed the stage, a sketchy simulacrum of Ford's Theater in Washington, with a majestic proscenium arch. As the action progressed, that arch shifted position to register the play's ever-shifting perspectives. In the final act, it leaned forlornly against a wall, an eloquent shorthand for the players' thwarted ambitions in the gray hours after Lincoln's assassination.
 ''The arch collapsed, and that was meant to send an emotional signal,'' said Mr. Loquasto, who designed the set and for whom such economy of gesture has long been a signature. That migratory arch goes straight to the heart of the play, which closes this weekend. It ''toys with the notion of what theater is,'' said Lynne Meadow, who directed the production at the Manhattan Theater Club, and underscores the show's themes: ''that the essence of theater is illusion; that one fact of performance can have many aspects, like a person.'' 
This month, Mr. Loquasto deploys a series of similarly deft conceits in three more shows appearing concurrently on the New York stage. For the Roundabout Theater's revival of the 1990 Craig Lucas romance ''Prelude to a Kiss'' at the American Airlines Theater, for which he created the sets, Mr. Loquasto devised a backdrop of row upon row of SoHo-style factory windows to suggest the bohemia of downtown Manhattan. For ''Inherit the Wind,'' a revival of the 1955 ''monkey trial'' drama at the Lyceum Theater, for which he did both sets and costumes, he recreated a battered courtroom crowded with people in rumpled linens to conjure a small town in turmoil.
 To reinforce the emotional heat of ''110 in the Shade,'' a Roundabout revival of the 1963 musical with songs by Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones (''The Fantasticks''), for which he also did both sets and costumes, he hung an enormous disc from the ceiling of Studio 54. Depending on how it is lighted and angled, it functions as a moon or, more often, as an implacably brilliant sun.
 The knack for making less say more has established Mr. Loquasto as one of America's foremost stage designers. ''Santo has a great editorial sense,'' said Doug Hughes, the director of ''Inherit the Wind.'' ''Among the battery of props that are all exquisitely chosen, he will recognize during rehearsal weeks that many are superfluous and will happily cut them away.''
 A compact man with close-cropped hair and a salt-and-pepper beard, Mr. Loquasto, 63, combines Zen-like calm with genial self-mockery. Offering a tour of his book-and-bibelot-clotted seven-room apartment on Riverside Drive, he showed none of the flamboyance or bloated self-importance that would betray a more, well, theatrical personality.
 Chiding himself for his incessant shopping, he explained that the playful Greek hunting scene that hangs above his mantel was unearthed during one of his frequent thrifting trips to upstate New York. ''When you shop as part of what you do, it can be deadly,'' he confided.
 An inveterate hunter-gatherer, he nevertheless says he has no trouble sacrificing an acquisitive streak to the requirements of a show. ''Accommodating almost to a fault,'' as he portrays himself, he will also insist that he has no discernible style.
 That point is arguable. It is true, though, that in a career spanning more than four decades, he has glided confidently between the extremes of austerity and clutter. For ''The Cherry Orchard,'' the innovative Andrei Serban production for the Public Theater, he conceived a lyrically white-on-white setting, its spareness relieved by a few sticks of furniture and some spindly trees. In ''American Buffalo'' he conveyed a mood of incipient chaos with a layered, sculptural set built on a dizzying accretion of props.
 His ever-malleable vision has earned him three Tony Awards and 10 nominations, and the allegiance of a few longtime collaborators. ''He has an ability to paint on so many different canvases,'' Ms. Meadow said, ''to bring to life everything from the simple set of 'Inherit the Wind,' to the most incredibly baroque design.''
 A mobile barbecue wheeled onto the stage in ''Prelude to a Kiss'' raises the specter of a rigidly conformist suburbia. In ''Inherit the Wind,'' Mr. Loquasto and Mr. Hughes, the director, filled part of the courtroom with spectators from the audience. ''We thought that would dramatize the idea of a body politic in a few efficient strokes,'' Mr. Hughes explained. ''Some of Santo's most striking ideas are the most simple; that sort of reduction releases power.''
 There are signs of the pack rat in the designer's apartment, where layer upon layer of books, pictures, set models and magazines first overwhelm the eye, then coalesce into a restful whole. Perched on a corner cabinet is a discarded model of a set for ''Faust,'' designed for the Metropolitan Opera. Gathered on a side table are the magazine clippings Mr. Loquasto uses in his research, among them a DKNY jeans advertisement that inspired the hair, makeup and overall mood of ''110 in the Shade.'' Each is arranged against a backdrop of peeling cream-tone walls.
 ''I'm somewhat drawn to a dilapidated world,'' Mr. Loquasto acknowledged, ''the re-creation of layers that you find in a place like Rome.'' Years ago, when he first moved in, he simulated the distressed look of age by scraping the walls bare, then just walking away.
 The apartment serves as a depot for assorted cartons, some filled with shoes for one of his myriad projects. ''We load things out of here and have them shipped,'' Mr. Loquasto said, ''so this place becomes more of a way station.''
 Heaped under tables and near the doors, those boxes are evidence of the projects he juggles continually, partly as an outlet for his protean energy, partly out of practical necessity. The need to take on as much work as he can handle is perhaps a remnant of the days when Mr. Loquasto, fresh out of Yale, was forced to take on multiple jobs simultaneously just to pay the bills.
 Hooked on theater growing up in Wilkes Barre, Pa., by the mid-1960s he was designing for the Williamstown Theater Festival, and as early as 1967 he did his first work for American Ballet Theater. After picking up an M.F.A. from Yale in 1969, he joined the New York Shakespeare Festival, then went on to collaborate on theater, film and dance works with thorny mavericks like Twyla Tharp, Woody Allen, Jerome Robbins and Mr. Serban.
 His relationship with Mr. Robbins, who died in 1998, was fraught. ''He was indecisive,'' his point of view vacillating until the 11th hour, Mr. Loquasto recalled. At that stage, the designer had his way by default. ''It was, 'Well, O.K., we'll have to work with what we have,' '' he remembered slyly telling Mr. Robbins.
 Over the years a similarly calculated passivity has helped him cope. Lonny Price, who directed ''110 in the Shade,'' originally asked for a sky drop over the stage, said Mr. Loquasto, who could not convince Mr. Price that such a notion might be overkill. ''It wasn't easy for Lonny to visualize things from a model,'' he said.
 But earlier this month, during technical rehearsals, Mr. Loquasto's vision seemed to have prevailed, his giant sun doubling as an incandescent sky. His battles with Mr. Robbins have taught him to wait.
 ''Sometimes,'' he said, ''you have to just let time be your ally.''

HEADLINE: Magnificent 'Seven'

BYLINE: By NAOMI SIEGEL

 BODY:
If you're not convinced that the American regional theater community would be a vastly poorer place without the Paper Mill Playhouse, ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' should make the case. 
 The playhouse's spanking new show, produced in collaboration with regional theaters in Beverly, Mass., and Houston, is a humdinger. It shouts volumes about the contribution of this venerable arts institution, currently suffering a financial crisis, as guardian, champion and devoted revivalist of classic American musical theater. With ''Seven Brides,'' a cheering audience experiences firsthand the Paper Mill's role as a unique theater resource.
From the rousing overture -- how many Broadway theaters can boast 17 first-class pit musicians? -- the production highlights what the Paper Mill does best. Under Scott Schwartz's stylish direction and with a cast of multitalented players who sing and dance their hearts out, the show offers nonstop pleasure. It does so in spite of a silly book by Lawrence Kasha and David Landry, mostly unmemorable music and lyrics by Gene de Paul and Johnny Mercer (supplemented by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn), and enough macho brawling and female posturing to raise the hackles of those in the audience who are offended by gender stereotypes. 
 Movie buffs remember ''Seven Brides'' as a hugely successful 1954 musical starring Howard Keel and Jane Powell. It was adapted for the stage in 1979 and presented briefly on Broadway in 1982. A television series of the same name, loosely based on the film, was yanked after one season. This current adaptation of ''Seven Brides'' features new orchestrations (Tom Helm is the spirited music director), spectacular settings of a pine-forested, snowy-peaked Oregon Territory, circa 1850, designed by Anna Louizos and lighted beautifully by Donald Holder, and charming, homespun period costumes by Jess Goldstein.
 Patti Colombo's choreography is outstanding. While referencing the legendary masters Agnes de Mille and Michael Kidd, she finds her own ballet-informed choreographic language that spins narrative as it delights the eye. The company rises to her challenge with a series of enchanting dance vignettes that are the high points of the show.
 The large cast is led by the vocally gifted Edward Watts and Michelle Dawson. Mr. Watts plays handsome, rugged Adam Pontipee, oldest of the unmarried Pontipee brothers, whose foray into town and ''three weeks' worth of courtin' in five minutes'' results in his marrying sassy Milly Bradon, played by Ms. Dawson. Milly pictures Adam's tiny cabin as a haven of peace and solitude; imagine her shock to discover his six unwashed, uncouth brothers living in the same tiny space. 
 ''I married seven brothers, became seven wives and seven mothers,'' she yowls in horror as the reality of her situation begins to hit home.
 The Pontipee brothers, each one grosser and wilder than the next, are played with rib-tickling results by Randy Bobish, Luke Longacre, Karl Warden, Travis Kelley, Eric Sciotto and Christian Delcroix. Mr. Sciotto is a hoot as the sixth offspring, the unfortunately named Frankincense (his mom ran out of alphabetically ordered Biblical names when it came to ''F''). Mr. Delcroix, as the youngest brother, Gideon, uses his voice to sweet effect in the lyric trio ''Love Never Goes Away.''
 With Milly taking over the day-to-day running of the household and teaching the brothers how to dance and court women, the stage is set for a second foray into town. This time six young village maidens are kidnapped to serve as six more brides, played fetchingly by Christina Rae Hedrick, Kate Marilley, Denise Payne, Margot De La Barre, Stephanie Fittro and Sarah Marie Jenkins. 
 Only after many months of celibate segregation, under Milly's strict supervision, and an isolating avalanche of snow (again strikingly produced by Ms. Louizos), do the couples couple. Adam stops pouting over Milly's take-charge ways and recognizes her for the gem that she is.
 Since ''Seven Brides'' belongs to a musical theater genre where happy endings are a foregone conclusion, you can bet the farm that all will eventually turn out well. One wishes the Paper Mill's future were as assured. ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' is to run at the Paper Mill Playhouse, Brookside Drive, Millburn, at least through April 29. Information: (973) 376-4343 or at www.papermill.org.

HEADLINE: 2 Major Bowls Will Test New Orleans's Recovery

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, April 26 

 BODY:
In January, Fiesta Bowl officials compared holding their bowl game and the Bowl Championship Series title game in the same week to conducting two major political conventions at once. 
 That is the task facing New Orleans this winter, when the city will play host to the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 and the title game on Jan. 7 in the second year of college football's double-hosting format.
College football leaders came here this week for the B.C.S. meetings. They, along with Sugar Bowl officials and New Orleans politicians, said they were confident that in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the infrastructure was in place to handle the influx of tourists and other challenges presented by the games. 
 ''Every day we get stronger in our ability to handle a major event,'' Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans said. ''So those two events, back to back, we should be able to create the synergies to provide the coverage, both from a sanitation and police standpoint, and a special events standpoint to have a world-class event.''
 In the downtown area where the Superdome, the French Quarter and a majority of the hotels are located, there is little evidence of Katrina's devastation. Only two major downtown hotels, the Hyatt and the Fairmont, are still closed. Of the 38,000 downtown hotel rooms available before Katrina, 32,000 are open. There are more restaurants open downtown now than before Katrina, according to numbers provided by the city's convention and visitors bureau. 
 While downtown and the surrounding areas above sea level -- known as the Sliver by the River -- may be regaining strength, they are in stunning contrast to nearby areas that many tourists do not see. 
 ''People will frolic in the streets in New Orleans and drink hurricanes on Bourbon Street and never see neighborhoods that look like an atomic bomb wiped them off the face of the earth,'' said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Tulane University. ''It's a tale of two cities, the Sliver by the River and the rest of the parts of town below sea level.'' 
 Stacy S. Head, a councilwoman for District B, which covers the downtown area, said it was unlikely that most tourists who came for the games would see the blight. 
 ''To paint a fair picture, we do have a problem in some of the devastated areas that frankly had problems before the storm,'' Head said. ''Anyone that comes to the city as a tourist, you're probably not going to know that anything happened.'' 
 In the immediate wake of Katrina, the Sugar Bowl in January 2006 was moved to Atlanta. This year's game was moved back to New Orleans, its home since 1935, and Louisiana State defeated Notre Dame, 41-14. 
 ''The people that come here will really enjoy it,'' L.S.U. Coach Les Miles said. ''Security was never an issue. Our guys were involved in every event. Our people that came to this city had great experiences.'' 
 Paul Hoolahan, the chief executive of the Sugar Bowl, said this week that he and his staff would be in a fishbowl until the games were held. ''Even in the best of circumstances, this is a tremendous challenge,'' he said. 
 Hoolahan said that he and his staff would have to calculate how many people will be needed to pull off the games. He also said that he was going to inquire through the governor's office about the availability of state troopers, the National Guard and the highest level of security clearance for the games. 
 ''I think the key element is preparation and planning and analyzing the situation and not trying to underestimate it or overestimate it,'' Hoolahan said. 
 Hoolahan said that the games would be important immediately and in the long term. A study released this week said that the three bowls in the Phoenix area last season brought $401 million to the local economy. Counting the New Orleans Bowl on Dec. 21, New Orleans will be host to three bowl games this winter. 
 ''The financial impact will probably be larger than the Super Bowl,'' Hoolahan said. ''That's a Band-Aid, that's not what we're looking for.
 ''Really, what we're looking for is the ability to prove to the rest of the world that we're back and we're the can-do event city that we were. We don't want anyone to have any hesitancy, any shyness about booking their next major, major event with us.''

HEADLINE: A Drive From Wet to East

BYLINE: By Jonathan Raban. 
Jonathan Raban is the author, most recently, of the novel ''Surveillance.''

DATELINE: Seattle 

 BODY:
FOR my eighth-grade daughter's spring break this year, we drove, on minor roads, from Seattle through Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah and Arizona, to see the Grand Canyon -- past 1,500 miles of landscape utterly new to her, although, born in Seattle, she is a native Westerner. The West she knows is the wet West, the urban corridor along Interstate 5, on the rainy side of the Cascade Mountains; the dry West, which is to say the vast bulk of our region, is a foreign country, of whose manners and language we wet-Westerners are cheerfully, carelessly ignorant.
 Less than an hour east of Seattle lies Snoqualmie Pass, and as the road descends, beside the Yakima River, the dry West begins as it means to continue: Douglas firs give way to sagebrush, juniper and pinon pines; on the car radio, rock gives way to country and gospel, then to empty static; bumper stickers change from Democratic to Republican; per capita incomes and house prices sink precipitously. When I first drove this way, 17 years ago, it struck me as being akin to climbing a hill in Wales only to find oneself in Syria. 
You move, almost at an eye blink, from a landscape watered by 36 inches of rainfall to a technical desert where 9 inches fall in a good year -- and good years are getting fewer. The dammed rivers of the dry West, like the Columbia and the Colorado, grievously overstretched by the demands made on them for electricity, drinking water and fantastically ingenious irrigation schemes, are both the region's most precious resource and its most vulnerable hostages to accelerated climate change. The dry West is getting dryer by the year, even as the wet West grows steadily richer, and the rift between the two -- in culture, politics, economy, theology -- can seem as deep as the Grand Canyon itself.
 It's not good to be such a rubbernecking tourist at one's own back door, reaching for the camera to snap the ghost towns, rotting false store fronts, abandoned farmsteads, as they loom out of the wide-open emptiness of rock and sage, where you can drive for 40 miles without seeing another vehicle. We know little and care less about the real lives of the rancher, farmer and copper miner, though the wet-Westers buy up inexpensive land here for weekend ranches, fly-fish the rivers, picnic in the spectacular national parks, drink in the mystique of the ''Old West,'' as if the entire region were a giant recreational area laid on to relieve the claustrophobia of big-city types from both coasts; a place belonging to past history, not the present; a human museum of men in cowboy hats, with guns on the racks of their pickups and blue-eyed, thousand-mile stares. 
 The dry-Westers understand us better than we do them: they know the tourist value of their own picturesque decay. In one day in Nevada, we passed three towns, each with its slogan -- ''The Living Ghost Town,'' ''The Friendliest Town on the Loneliest Road in America,'' ''Where the West Comes Alive'' -- and all exploiting the queasy charm of the boarded-up business and the dead-ended dream. At ''The Friendliest Town ,'' the Owl Club, a casino-bar-restaurant, sells T-shirts emblazoned with a list of people most unwelcome there: the string of derisive epithets, some unprintable, ends with the word ''Liberals.''
 We deserve the sneer beneath the smile. They know what we want -- to demolish their dams, starve their farms of water to supply our cities, reintroduce the wolf, buffalo, and grizzly to their workplaces, close their mines, enjoy their West as our nature-playground. We're all for the ''Old West'' summer rodeo, but we'll sign petitions against grazing on public lands.
 Back on the wet coast, I think of the rue in a remark made to me in a Nevada bar: ''If only we could find a use for sagebrush -- like turning it to ethanol -- we'd all be millionaires.''

HEADLINE: Document Dispute at Center of Wolfowitz Case

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
Arriving as president of the World Bank in the summer of 2005, Paul D. Wolfowitz told colleagues that he was eager to tackle poverty in Africa and corruption in aid. But almost immediately he became consumed by frustrating negotiations with bank officials over the status of his companion, an employee at the bank, documents released this month show.
 Now these documents are at the center of the World Bank's inquiry into his conduct and Mr. Wolfowitz's defense, both of which will be presented at the World Bank's board of directors on Monday. 
 Instead of offering definitive answers on Mr. Wolfowitz's conduct, however, the documents on the handling of the transfer, promotion and salary of Shaha Ali Riza, Mr. Wolfowitz's companion, have become a matter of conflicting interpretations.
 Mr. Wolfowitz and his lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, are expected to say that the documents back their argument that in handling Ms. Riza's pay raise, promotion and transfer, Mr. Wolfowitz ''acted on the advice of the board's ethics committee to work out an agreement'' fair to her and in compliance with bank rules.
 But a committee of the bank's board looking into the situation is circulating a document indicating that, after he got authorization to handle the matter, Mr. Wolfowitz appears to have violated bank rules and ethical standards of his own employment contract by granting her an outsize pay raise and a major promotion.
 On Monday, board members are expected to ask him what criteria he used in granting the salary increase, why he apparently did not clear the specifics with others and why he allowed, or directed, his aides to spread what they say was a falsehood, namely that the ethics committee had approved the salary.
 Some time in the coming week, the 24-member board may ask for Mr. Wolfowitz's resignation, declare a loss of confidence in his leadership or do nothing in the hope that negotiations with the Bush administration can bring about a voluntary resignation. Few doubt the board's determination to push him out. 
 The documents do show that Mr. Wolfowitz in 2005 alerted bank officials to the potential conflict of interest posed by his relationship with Ms. Riza and that he had sought to recuse himself from discussions about how to resolve it. 
 When an anonymous whistle-blower complained about the salary increase in early 2006, Ad Melkert, the chairman of the bank's ethics committee, said in a letter on Feb. 28 that the complaint did not warrant ''any further review by the committee.''
 Mr. Bennett is expected to argue that Mr. Wolfowitz's actions were in accordance with advice by ethics officials and were subsequently cleared by these same officials. This view is endorsed by many who defend Mr. Wolfowitz. 
 ''The initial decision on Ms. Riza's salary was reviewed in 2005 and again in 2006,'' said Ruth Wedgwood, an expert in international law and diplomacy and a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Wolfowitz. ''This is a case of what lawyers call 'asked and answered.' Why is it being brought up now?''
 Mr. Melkert declined requests for interviews, but he issued a statement 10 days ago saying that he approved Mr. Wolfowitz's actions in 2005 without knowing about the salary package and that in 2006 he had no authority to reopen it as an ethics matter. ''At no time did Mr. Wolfowitz or anyone else in bank management disclose to the ethics committee the terms and conditions of the external assignment,'' he said. 
 Xavier Coll, a vice president for human resources, was the official directed by Mr. Wolfowitz to give Ms. Riza her pay and promotion. He also declined a request for an interview, but an official close to him said Mr. Coll was uneasy about the raise in 2005 and did not formally approve it even while letting it go through.

HEADLINE: Blotting Out the Big Sky

BYLINE: By Deirdre McNamer. 
Deirdre McNamer is the author of the forthcoming novel ''Red Rover.''

DATELINE: Missoula, Mont. 

 BODY:
APRIL is the month many Montanans start looking for dollar signs in the weather. Is the spring runoff from the mountains once again too early, too fast, too meager to mitigate the drought plaguing the farmers and ranchers who are the linchpins of the state's economy? Are river temperatures too high, too soon, for cold-water fish like trout that bring in thousands of tourists every summer? Will Glacier National Park's rapidly receding glaciers fail to bring in visitors this summer, or lure them for one last look? Will today's rain last more than a day? Will the forests wait until August to burn? 
 When I was a child in the 1950s, much of Montana felt like a place that couldn't really be touched by the hand of man. Sometimes we threw our hamburger wrappers out the car window just to watch them land on the empty prairie and flutter like tiny flags planted on the moon. Then they blew away and out of sight and there was nothing to show that we'd ever passed through. 
Even a decade later, brainwashed enough by the intervening litterbug campaign to keep our trash to ourselves, driving hundreds of miles in a gas-guzzling monster to a spring basketball tournament seemed all about freedom and celebration and the end of another scathing white winter. If someone had told us that we were altering the weather in the slightest respect, we would have laughed them into the next county.
 The weather that now bears very directly on the Montana economy has been, as one of our University of Montana climate scientists, Steve Running, puts it, ''a slow-motion crisis'' that began in the 1980s. That's the decade when ocean temperatures off Victoria, British Columbia, which determine downwind climates in Montana, began to turn upward. And it's the decade that saw the conflagrations in Yellowstone National Park transform into a pattern of ''monster wildfires'' every two to three years rather than every 20 or 30 years.
 Mr. Running helped write the recent report from the International Panel on Climate Change on global warming trends, and he spoke at a library awards banquet I happened to attend a few weeks ago. Oddly, given the dire tone of the report, Mr. Running seems a rather buoyant, hopeful guy. In the 1980s, he pointed out, technological innovations like the cellphone, iPod and Internet-connected laptop were beyond our wildest imaginings. He said that a similar burst of technological innovation, already in progress, signals the possibility of flattening out carbon dioxide emissions over the next half-century.
 But even if technology comes through, humans might still insist on throwing their wrappers out the window, in a manner of speaking. Will we be willing to drive 65 miles per hour rather than 75? Cut our automobile miles in half? And, maybe most important, fly less? 
 ''I'm really worried about jet travel,'' Mr. Running said. And it doesn't take much poking around in the statistics to get worried too. While air travel generates only 3 percent of this country's annual carbon dioxide emissions, the pollution and clouds that jets produce increase that impact on the climate by two to four times.
 So here's the sort of situation you've got in Montana on the brink of tourist season. The state's major economic assets include the fish that people want to catch, the birds they want to shoot, the vistas they want to contemplate, the unspoiled terrain they want to experience. And a large percentage of the tourists who come to do those things will not think twice about arriving in a car or a jet, although these emissions negate a lot of the Prius driving, fluorescent light bulb using, Energy Star appliance buying and local-food eating that the tourist might practice at home. And each trip makes it at least incrementally less likely that the fish and wildlife and terrain they come to see will be intact the next time they arrive.
 There is a window of economic opportunity for Montanans between April and September, when about 70 percent of the 10 million who visit the state each year show up and spend their money. We aren't going to tell anybody to stay away. Know, though, that the way you get here affects what we may have to offer you in the future. And think about taking the train.

HEADLINE: Travel in Latin America: Cheaper and Easier

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
TRAVEL to Latin America has been on the upswing as countries there look to tourism for economic growth, and tour operators in the United States and Canada offer exotic vacations to the south. But until recently, getting around within Latin America -- even in popular countries like Mexico -- was a hassle often involving multiple plane changes or long bus rides over rough roads.
 Now, thanks to an increase in low-cost airlines in Brazil and Mexico, which account for 60 percent of the Latin America's air traffic, it's getting easier to jet around.
In the last two years, at least five new low-cost carriers, including Click Mexicana, InterJet and Volaris, have started service in Mexico, according to ALTA, the Latin American Air Transport Association. And the low-cost airlines GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, BRA and WebJet now account for more than 40 percent of Brazil's domestic market. 
 Even some budget carriers from the United States have begun expanding to Latin America. Spirit Airlines started service to San Jose, Costa Rica, on April 5 and plans to serve Guatemala City from Fort Lauderdale and Los Angeles starting May 10 and 11 respectively. It also has filed for service to Caracas, Venezuela, and to Lima and Chiclayo in Peru. 
 JetBlue, which flies to Cancun, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, hasn't yet announced plans for other routes to Latin America, but Sebastian White, a spokesman, said in an e-mail message that the airline is ''constantly evaluating new routes,'' and Latin America ''is certainly an attractive market.'' 
 In Mexico, said Alex de Gunten, executive director of ALTA, ''the typical joke about two years ago was that everybody and their mother was starting a low-cost carrier.'' The jump in budget airlines, he said, ''has meant more competition in a number of routes and translated to better deals for U.S. consumers.''
 Volaris, for example, has been advertising one-way domestic fares on its Web site, www.volaris.com.mx, at prices as low as 769 Mexican pesos, or about $70 at 11 pesos to $1, between Toluca Airport, 40 miles from Mexico City, and Aguacalientes from April 16 to May 13 (for the San Marcos National Fair) and 250 pesos between Puebla and Tijuana from May 18 to June 18. Alma de Mexico, which flies to 13 destinations in Mexico, has been advertising flights between San Jose del Cabo and Guadalajara for 1,324 pesos at www.alma.com.mx. And a recent search on Click Mexicana's Web site, www.clickmx.com, for flights in May from Mexico City to tourist cities like Merida and Zihuatanejo, turned up one-way fares from 1,085 and 1,049 pesos, with taxes and fees. 
 There are also new direct flights replacing connections that previously required stops or plane changes. For example, vacationers planning to sightsee in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city, and then hit the sand in Cancun, used to have to stop in Mexico City. Now Click, a subsidiary of Mexicana Airlines, which advertises leather seats with 35 inches of legroom as Coach Plus, flies nonstop between Guadalajara and Cancun. 
 The new nonstop routes ''make it very attractive to travelers coming from cities, that otherwise would require a very long trip, to come to Cancun,'' said Arturo Escaip Manzur, chief executive of the Cancun Convention and Visitors Bureau, which attributes an increase in domestic travelers to new direct flights from budget airlines and plans to promote the routes in marketing campaigns. ''A stop in Mexico City,'' he said, ''might make them choose another location.''
 Ben Gritzewsky, a travel agent who specializes in Mexico at Frosch Vacations in Houston, said he tended to book with major national airlines like Aeromexico or Mexicana because of their mileage program partnerships and ease of booking, but also noted that there were a few routes between second- and third-tier cities that the larger carriers don't cover. ''For Southern California residents,'' he said, ''it may be advantageous to use Avolar's Tijuana gateway occasionally in order to fly directly into the interior.'' Toluca, he added, which Volaris and InterJet both fly from, ''is an alternative if you are in far west Mexico City and want to avoid the big airport or crosstown traffic.'' 
 Like most low-cost carriers in the United States, the Latin American budget airlines are generally of the no-frills variety, offering a single class of seats, serving snacks instead of meals, and keeping costs down with low maintenance and high efficiency. 
 Booking can be a challenge if you don't speak Spanish. Only a few have agreements with companies like Worldspan and Sabre, which distribute fare information to United States travel agents or familiar discount Web sites like Expedia. And since their business is primarily geared toward domestic travelers, few offer their own Web sites in English or take American Express credit cards. Volaris, which offers flights to 14 destinations in Mexico including Cancun, Los Cabos and Morelia, is one of the few that does both. Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, which serves 49 destinations in Brazil and also flies to Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile and Peru, also offers booking in English (www.voegol.com.br). Outside Brazil, it accepts only American Express cards or, at a ticket counter, cash. 
 The Latin American carriers are regulated by civil aviation authorities in their own countries. ''They've been very strict,'' said Alex de Gunten, of the Latin American Air Transport Association, in enforcing their regulations. Last month the Mexican government suspended operations of the low-cost carrier Lineas Aereas Azteca because it failed to comply with safety, administrative and technical rules, the Associated Press reported. Azteca, which has 90 days to correct the problems, is the second low-cost carrier to be grounded by the government in the last year. Aero California was suspended last April for failing to meet safety standards. It corrected its violations and has resumed some flights.
 Last fall, a Boeing 737 operated by Gol crashed in the Amazon, killing all 154 people aboard. Investigations of the crash, which is believed to have been caused by a collision with a small business jet, are continuing. 
 As low-cost carriers continue to take off in Latin America, they are gaining a greater share of the overall market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Gol accounted for more than a third of the Brazilian air market. At the end of March, the company bought Varig, once Brazil's largest airline.
 But as the low-cost carriers grow, the boundaries between them and older airlines are blurring. ''Gol entered the market strong and with this idea of low cost,'' said Augusto Simas, managing director at Travel Place, a travel agency in Rio de Janeiro. But as the company expanded, he said, its prices went up slightly, and its competitors' prices went down a little bit. ''Now,'' he said, ''they're kind of balanced.''

HEADLINE: Hydrogen's Second Coming

BYLINE: By DON SHERMAN

DATELINE: LAKEHURST, N.J. 

 BODY:
WHEN the largest aircraft ever built -- the pride of Nazi Germany -- crashed in flames at the United States Navy's airship base here, it took 36 lives and smeared the reputation of hydrogen for decades.
 In less than a minute, the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 turned hydrogen, which provided the zeppelin's lift, into a pariah. But 70 years later, a growing number of advocates are promoting hydrogen as a panacea, a promising alternative to petroleum. In the last decade, every large carmaker has jumped on the hydrogen express.
In dozens of laboratories and research centers, scientists and engineers are busy searching for ways to reduce the cost and improve the practicality of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Development has progressed to the point that some of these prototype vehicles are in daily service, commuting around Detroit, delivering packages in Washington, serving urban bus routes.
 To look in on the development progress of hydrogen vehicles, The New York Times invited 10 companies actively promoting hydrogen for personal transportation to bring their vehicles to the Naval Air Engineering Station here. With pressure mounting to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, the anniversary of a pivotal event 70 years ago seemed an appropriate time to look for a clearer understanding of what cars will be like in 30 years. 
 Some carmakers deemed the disaster site an awkward location for this gathering; others were sympathetic but unable to field a vehicle because experimental mules have testing and appearance schedules busier than those of presidential hopefuls. The three hydrogen-powered vehicles that did arrive here (all by trailer, because refueling was not available for the long trips from their bases) were not the latest models from the auto show circuit, but hard-working development vehicles with thousands of testing miles on their odometers.
 Weather was also a factor. The day of the gathering was fraught by the most severe northeaster in years. Six inches of rain was followed by flooded roads and snow, as the winds blew and angry skies frowned. But the show went on, thanks in part to the hosts at the base and the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society. 
 The Hindenburg anniversary is not the only reason hydrogen is in the news. Four years ago, in his State of the Union address, President Bush announced a $1.2 billion hydrogen initiative to foster clean air and lessen dependence on imported oil. The Department of Energy has conducted marriages of sorts, joining each domestic automaker with an energy company -- General Motors and Shell; Ford and DaimlerChrysler with BP -- to encourage research and set standards for refueling hardware and safety provisions. 
 As hydrogen gains favor, hydrocarbons seem to be taking over the role of villain. Peak oil theorists, especially Matthew Simmons, chairman of the Simmons & Company investment bank and the author of ''Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy'' contend that increased demand will outpace the ability to increase production. And the Supreme Court's April 2 ruling that the E.P.A. has authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, as it does tailpipe emissions, was a powerful vote against fossil fuels.
 So the three hydrogen-fueled vehicles that gathered at the Hindenburg crash site are harbingers of the future, proof that all of hydrogen's potential in transportation did not go up in flames 70 years ago.
 The spot where the Hindenburg met its end is now a historic landmark. A heavy yellow anchor chain surrounds a concrete pad replicating the size, shape, and final resting place of the Hindenburg's control car. Rick Zitarosa, historian of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, said the Navy intended to preserve the site in its current form. 
 The vehicles here, and three other experimental cars driven elsewhere, cover a broad spectrum of hydrogen possibilities. Here are highlights: FORD E-450 SHUTTLE Ford regards hydrogen-fueled internal-combustion engines as ''a bridge to fuel cells, the powertrain of the future.'' Teamed with BP, Ford built a fleet of 30 E-450 shuttle buses. 
 ''We believe this is an affordable and sensible way to transition from today's fossil fuels to a hydrogen-based economy,'' John Lapetz Jr., the Ford program manager, said. His company also has several active fuel-cell vehicle projects.
 Ford's E-450 shuttle is a familiar sight around airport parking lots and hotels. In the conversion to hydrogen, some of the passenger area was walled off to house six pressure tanks wrapped in carbon fiber, each rated for storage at 5,000 pounds per square inch.
 Mr. Lapetz characterized the modifications necessary to tailor Ford's Triton V-10 to run on hydrogen as ''fairly minor.'' A supercharger was added to feed additional air. 
 It goes without saying that this vehicle drives like a bus. The husky V-10 provides ample urge to get the rig rolling briskly. The supercharger sounds like a distant police siren. Mr. Lapetz said that Ford had experimented with other engines and that hydrogen could replace gasoline and diesel fuel in many of them. GENERAL MOTORS HYDROGEN3 G.M.'s first fuel-cell vehicles were shown to the public four decades ago. The 1966 Electrovan weighed 7,100 pounds and required 30 seconds to accelerate to 60 m.p.h. G.M.'s fuel-cell research intensified a decade ago. About three dozen fuel-cell vehicles and concept cars have been designed, built and tested by G.M., representing an investment of more than $1 billion, according to a company spokeswoman.
 Based on an Opel Zafira, the HydroGen3 is a third-generation design. (A Chevrolet Volt with G.M.'s fifth-generation fuel-cell was unveiled this month at the Shanghai Motor Show.) A fleet of 28 wagons was built, with hydrogen stored in either gaseous or liquid form. 
 HydroGen3 is a world traveler, demonstrating the hydrogen future in Washington, delivering packages in Tokyo and accumulating mileage in Europe for three years.
 Since this is an experimental mule, little effort has been directed at quieting the clicks, hums, drones and growls of gases being pumped and chemically converted into electrical energy. Under acceleration, the HydroGen3 sounds like an angry golf cart. With only 100 horsepower on tap, it requires more than 15 seconds to reach 60 m.p.h. according to Matt Atwell and Joe Gerschutz, G.M. engineers along for the Lakehurst ride. TOYOTA PRIUS The stock-appearing (well, except for the exterior lettering) Prius that visited Lakehurst is configured to run on hydrogen with roughly the same power and torque as a gasoline-hybrid version. The 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine was fitted with a turbocharger and intercooler; all of the Prius's hybrid features were intact.
 What is unusual about this car is how the hydrogen is stored. ECD Ovonics, the company that invented nickel-metal-hydride batteries, focused its expertise on carrying hydrogen in solid form in tanks filled with powdered metal. Two tanks fitted under the Prius's floor are filled with hydrogen by connecting a 1,500 p.s.i. hose to a standard fitting. The tank capacity is 7.9 pounds, enough for nearly 200 miles.
 Robert C. Stempel, the former G.M. chairman who now heads ECD Ovonics, points out that this storage system's lower hydrogen pressure is much less expensive than the 5,000 or 10,000 p.s.i. pressure necessary with compressed-gas storage. One negative the company is striving to improve is the 550-pound weight of the Prius's fuel system. 
 Except for a few turbo whistles and whirs, the car sounds and performs exactly the same as a standard Toyota Prius. Tests showed reductions in all tailpipe emissions except oxides of nitrogen.
 In addition to the vehicles brought to the base, here are three other hydrogen vehicles I have driven: BMW HYDROGEN 7 BMW, which began studying the use of hydrogen in piston engines 25 years ago, is building a fleet of 100 demonstration vehicles on a regular assembly line. The Hydrogen 7 combines BMW's flagship sedan, a modified 6-liter V-12 and a superinsulated storage tank to provide dual-fuel mobility. 
 The liquid hydrogen offers a 125-mile driving range; when that is consumed, a button on the steering wheel switches the engine over to run on gasoline for 310 more miles from the standard 19.6-gallon gas tank. The engine is tuned to deliver nearly the same power on either fuel.
 The detuned engine and 500 pounds added to carry hydrogen safely result in slightly impaired performance, but the Hydrogen 7's 143-m.p.h. top speed and 400-mile range easily surpass existing fuel-cell vehicles. And while running on hydrogen, the only traces of carbon compounds in the exhaust come from engine oil consumed during combustion.
 While driving a Hydrogen 7, I listened intently for changes in engine operation when the fuel supply was switched. In the hydrogen mode, there is a sharper and more metallic noise during acceleration, but most drivers would never notice that subtle difference. The beauty of the Hydrogen 7 is that it exploits hydrogen's benefits without making existing powertrains obsolete. MERCEDES-BENZ F-CELL Since it began hydrogen experiments in 1994, DaimlerChrysler has invested more than $1 billion and built more than 100 fuel-cell vehicles. A fleet of 30 buses has been carrying passengers daily in 10 European cities. Sixty Mercedes-Benz A-Class sedans converted from conventional gasoline powertrains to a more futuristic F-Cell configuration have logged 2 million miles. DaimlerChrysler and Ford have made large investments in Ballard Power Systems, a leading fuel-cell developer. 
 In the tall four-seat A-class, passengers sit above the drivetrain, tucked beneath the floor. This arrangement is also a handy way to package the bulky storage tanks and control electronics necessary to make a fuel cell operate. 
 The 20-second start-up ritual is accompanied by a chorus of clicks, whirs and buzzes. Steering, shifter, accelerator and brake controls are identical to the A-Class; an electronic display on the center console tracks electricity flow. 
 Even though it rides tall, the F-Cell corners securely thanks to a low center of gravity. With only 87 horsepower to move 3,380 pounds, acceleration is sluggish. According to the factory, the run to 60 m.p.h. takes 15 seconds and a governor limits top speed to 87 m.p.h. Michelin radial tires inflated to 38 p.s.i. delivered a rocky ride over the poorly maintained roads I drove. HONDA FCX Those fearful that a hydrogen future bodes ill for style and elegance need only examine the FCX, a sleek and sexy way to ride into the future.
 Honda has cleverly engineered the FCX to pack all its hardware under a low roof while leaving ample legroom for four passengers and a decent amount of trunk space. A 127-horsepower A.C. electric motor is fed by a fuel cell twice the size of a home computer that produces 100 kilowatts of electrical power.
 Driving the FCX demonstrated impressive performance: acceleration from zero to 60 m.p.h. takes less than 10 seconds and top speed is more than 90 m.p.h. There was none of the gear whine, relay clicks, motor hum and pump moaning present in other fuel-cell prototypes. There is minimal mechanical noise, just a soft growl that intensifies when you depress the accelerator (and a power gauge in the dash glows brighter).
 Next year, Honda will begin building the FCX in small numbers for demonstration fleets.

HEADLINE: Enron, the Supreme Court and Shareholders on the Brink

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LONG ago and far away, when I was a little tyke studying economics under the tutelage of C. Lowell Harriss at Columbia, and finance under Jan Ginter Deutsch and Henry Wallich at Yale, we were taught that the stockholder was the ultimate owner of a public company, the ultimate boss, the ultimate trustor to whom the highest standards of fiduciary duty were owed.
 These included the duty to put the interests of the stockholder ahead of the interests of the managers and their agents in each and every situation, to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, to disclose each and every material fact and to avoid any subterfuge that would operate to conceal a material fact. 
These duties were common-law obligations, but some of them had also been codified in federal and state law. Federal law, in particular, enacted after the disclosure of huge securities fraud surrounding the 1929 stock market crash that started the Great Depression, prohibited the use of any artifice or device to conceal material facts or to keep them from being disclosed to the investing public. 
 Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 specifically barred the use of any manipulative device or contrivance that would defraud or mislead. A rule adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under that act, the famous Rule 10b-5 said that it would be unlawful for any person ''directly or indirectly'' to ''engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.''
 That, you would think, would have special relevance to the huge scandal at Enron. In that sad story, managers of the company used various devices to conceal from the markets and the investing public that the company was essentially a huge fraud.
 In that effort, the managers were helped considerably by a number of very large investment banks. These banks and brokerages used complex transactions that made it look as if Enron were making money when in fact it was insolvent. Andrew S. Fastow, the former finance boss at Enron, testified during legal proceedings about Enron that he saw the large banks as ''problem solvers'' who would come up with these schemes and thus help the company conceal the reality of its dire situation.
 Now, you would think that if this were true, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Barclays -- named in an investor lawsuit -- might possibly be liable to the defrauded stockholders, whose losses were in the tens of billions of dollars, and might owe some little pittance to them. (Banks including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and CIBC have already paid more than $7.3 billion to settle with Enron shareholders.) You would think that there would at least be a trial about it.
 Ah, but then you would be missing the point that the law is a wily, cunning beast of utter unpredictability. Some years ago, in 1994, after a series of disastrous missteps by accounting firms in connection with an earlier series of securities frauds, the Supreme Court brought out an opinion in the case called Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver. 
 In this long and incomprehensible case, the high court basically said that there would be no 10(b) liability for players who ''merely'' aided and betted securities fraud.
 Just as an opinion, by little me, this was done to save the accounting firms from completely immolating themselves by their misconduct. However, the facts of that case were somewhat limited. The defendant, Central Bank, had been the trustee for $26 million in defaulted bonds issued by a local public building authority. But Central was not its investment bank and did not issue investment analysis and, moreover, the securities in question were not publicly traded.
 The Enron fraud involved a public company and had a much wider scope. In a huge class-action case where millions of documents had been collected in a federal district court, and in which many witnesses had been deposed, a jury trial was headed to daylight. But suddenly last month, something happened. A three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit United States Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled that the class-action suit against investment banks over Enron could not proceed. (Individuals' ability to pursue claims was not affected.)
 The panel held that although its ruling might prevent justice from being done and satisfaction from being had, the acts of the investment bankers were at most aiding and abetting, not direct acts, and therefore not actionable under 10(b) as construed in the Central Bank case.
 Ouch. Yes, the defendant banks are accused of concealing the true facts about Enron and likely led investors to buy when they should have sold. Yes (and this is a beauty), at the same time the investment banks were helping Enron with its questionable financials, their ''analysts'' were praising Enron. (As the petitioners' brief notes in an appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn the Fifth Circuit decision, these were ''full service'' banks.)
 But, according to the Fifth Circuit panel, this was not enough. This was not a scheme or contrivance to defraud, they said. Yes, the facts were completely different from those of the Central Bank case, but the banks were to be let off the hook. This was in the name of offering predictability in these cases (apparently the predictability that the stockholders would be mistreated). 
 But not all hope is lost. A tasty appeal has been filed, which is a little masterpiece of legal argumentation. 
 Now, the Supreme Court can have another look at this case. It can return some dignity and rights to Enron stockholders and send up a warning flare to investment banks to avoid helping out with financial fraud. It can let this case go forward to trial.
 This is a potential golden moment for the stockholders -- or another step down the dreary alley toward extinction of the rights of those poor whipped dogs: the actual owners of America's public companies. It is up to the Supreme Court to right the ship.

HEADLINE: A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
THEY came in sweatshirts and fuzzy slippers, suits and oxfords, seeking chocolate muffins and Cheerios. Some grabbed a yogurt and left. Others lingered. In the room high above the Hudson River, they relished the food, the vistas and one another's company for as long as they could stretch a New York minute.
 So began another morning at Orion, a 60-story condominium on West 42nd Street with a glass body and a Club Med soul, where residents in anything from pajamas to pinstripes can enjoy a taste of camaraderie with their free (yes, free) daily breakfast, Starbucks coffee included.
''It's almost impossible not to make a friend here,'' said Danny SiFonte, the resident manager with a buildingwide celebrity akin to that of Norm on ''Cheers.'' 
 ''We're going to do movie nights and we're going to do book clubs,'' said Nancy Diaz, a resident who, in an interview, likened the condo to a cruise ship. ''There's talk of using the pool for water volleyball. We'll have Monday night sports. We have a spring fling coming up in May.''
 Clearly, Orion is incubating a mutant strain of New Yorker. 
 New Yorkers, as any MetroCard-carrying resident knows, are not notably genial neighbors. Many get to know one another solely by what manages to permeate their deadbolted doors -- an odoriferous stew, the wail of a child, the hushed sighs of intimate moments. 
 But the boom in condos loaded with amenities, along with the construction of some high-end rental buildings, has created opportunities for neighbors to make the transition from polite elevator nods to cocktail-caliber mingling. Of 19 properties in the city with units being marketed and sold by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group since fall 2005, all have community amenities like gyms, lounges and roof decks. 
 These and more novel spaces -- cinemas, wet bars, squash courts, outdoor rain showers -- are putting lounges with a lonely television set to shame, and they are fostering a clubby college-dormitory atmosphere in several developments. Some residents said they can't help but hobnob, especially if they want to take advantage of what they paid for. 
 ''Instead of staying up in our apartment, we always stay here,'' said Annie Jose, 54, who was nibbling a bagel and raisin bread at Orion one morning. ''Sometimes we have two, three tables joined so everyone can talk.''
 Developers, too, are embracing the idea of friendliness. A six-building condo development in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, for instance, which will have its first open house on May 6, has been named Hello and given a name-tag sticker as its branding image.
 It already has YouTube, Flickr and cheeky MySpace Web pages for its buildings, with one MySpace page claiming: ''The poker tables alone will make friends and enemies, but everyone can all get along by watching 'Badlands' on the big screen.'' 
 The amenities, like rooftop cabanas, a barbecue area, wine cellar, library, children's playroom and pool, are spread throughout the six buildings, in part to motivate residents to fraternize. 
 ''We're extremely social creatures, and I think people in New York really suffer from an inability to really interact with people,'' said Susan Meiklejohn, an associate professor of urban planning at Hunter College. ''And that's what these developers are realizing.'' 
 This is not because New Yorkers are cold, Dr. Meiklejohn said, but because the city is so dense that people avoid one another to establish buffer zones. ''What level of friendliness can you possibly sustain each day if you have to say hello to everybody you meet on 34th Street?'' she said. 
 In many new buildings, though, neighbors are venturing beyond tight-lipped hellos at the mailbox. At a Chelsea condo that opened last year, groups of residents have organized Friday night cocktails and floor mixers, and gathered on Sundays to watch ''The Sopranos.'' Some are planning a rotating party this summer.
 ''I was in my old building seven years, and it wasn't until the last year that I got to know my neighbors,'' said Carol Candiano, who lived in an Upper East Side prewar building before buying her apartment at 555 West 23rd Street. ''People kept to themselves.''
 Yet even within a spirited building like Orion, experiences vary. Ms. Jose, a nurse, said she has made numerous friends there, while another owner, Tanya Cereda, 25, a waitress, said she feels ''at home'' with her neighbors but has not established friendships. 
 Ginger Gilden, on the other hand, said she has become part of a close network of mothers and nannies since she and her husband moved last year to be@ClintonWest, a condo building in Hell's Kitchen, from a rental building in Queens. ''We all have the same pediatrician,'' said Ms. Gilden, an architect. And she said she is looking forward to a coming golf tournament, to be held at the building's open-air putting green. 
 ''It has a small neighborhood feel to it,'' Ms. Gilden said of the building, ''like its own little town.''
 That is how neighbors meet in many other parts of the country, gathered as so many are in communities built around golf courses and recreation centers. It is the story of Florida, Arizona, North Carolina -- places to which New Yorkers flee.
 But in New York, tenants and apartment owners rarely enter buildings expecting a welcome wagon. Indeed, Bre Zack, 20, a student at Pratt Institute and an intern at Christie's, said she expected little when she moved to EastCoast, a rental building with a gym, sun deck and lounge areas in Long Island City, Queens, from her Bedford-Stuyvesant brownstone, where she said ''no one spoke with one another.'' 
 Yet ''everyone was so friendly upon my arrival,'' she said. ''All of my neighbors came out to say hello to me and ask if I needed anything.'' That atmosphere became more evident once she began using the amenities regularly.
 Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm, estimated that there are about 15,000 to 20,000 new residential condo units in development in New York City. Sales of condo units in the first quarter of this year reached 1,703, the highest in at least 20 years, according to data from Miller Samuel. About 30 percent of the 2,994 condo units listed for sale were from new developments.
 Real estate professionals said the new buildings are more likely to have community space, making opportunities to socialize more plentiful. 
 ''These amenities are drawing people out of their apartments,'' said Pamela Liebman, the president and chief executive of the Corcoran Group. ''This has become a way of life.'' 
 At least for those who can afford it. 
 Available 698-square-foot studio apartments in the William Beaver House, a residence in the Financial District being developed by Andre Balazs, the hotelier, range from about $950,000 to $1.1 million. The perks, designed to encourage social interaction, include a cinema with day beds, a lap pool, a covered outdoor dog park and an outdoor basketball court with bleachers. 
 ''You can think of the entire building as your home,'' he said.
 Then again, as Mr. Balazs said, people may become friendly in these buildings because they are ''self selecting'' clubs. 
 People in poor or working-class neighborhoods, on the other hand, meet on stoops, at city-run pools and in community gardens, said Dalton Conley, the chairman of the sociology department at New York University, and parents have always used parks and playgrounds to meet neighbors and foster a sense of community. ''I do think this possibly is new to these folks who have traditionally used economic power to buy privacy and individual anonymity,'' Dr. Conley said.
 Once people move into amenity-drenched buildings, however, some discover that Mister Rogers was indeed onto something.
 Highlyann Krasnow, the executive vice president of the Developers Group, said befriending the neighbors is especially common in buildings that are in emerging neighborhoods where there are younger buyers and somewhat lower price points.
 The type of amenity and its placement within a building also affects just how friendly the vibe is, said Shaun Osher, chief executive of CORE Group Marketing. 
 ''There are some buildings that seem like they're turning into a frat house,'' he said, adding, ''We're doing a condo on Fifth Avenue. If we put a hot tub in a common area it really would not resonate with our buyer.''
 Not every residential experience, obviously, revolves around amenities. Jim Malkin, chairman of SourceMedia, which publishes American Banker and other financial publications, said his five-story East Village walk-up had open house-style parties every Christmas when residents wandered among apartments, eating and drinking. He now lives in the Gretsch Building, a condo in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where there is a common space, but he said it is not used very often.
 ''It really depends on how friendly you want to be,'' Mr. Malkin said, adding that those, like himself, who want to befriend their neighbors, will always do so, amenities or not. 
 ''The nice thing about New York is you can make that choice,'' said Judith DeSena, an associate professor of sociology who teaches a course about neighborhoods at St. John's University.
 That people today commonly buy into a building before it is completed and all move in about the same time may account for a good deal of the friendliness. There are no entrenched social circles to penetrate, no ornery characters who have been ruling the roost for 20 years. The anticipation of collectively shaping the atmosphere of the building begins well before the owners move in, thanks to building blogs and Champagne opening celebrations.
 ''It's a bonding experience,'' Mr. Osher said. 
 Ms. Candiano agreed, saying that moving into 555 West 23rd Street ''was like the first year of college.'' 
 The unanswered question is whether they still will be friends come senior year.

HEADLINE: When He Speaks, It's in America's Voice

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: PRINCETON 

 BODY:
IT wouldn't be much of a stretch to call Frank Newport the mirror of the American public's conscience -- or at least the public's statistician general.
 ''I go to a cocktail party and people will ask, say, 'What do you think about the war in Iraq?' '' Mr. Newport said. ''So I'll say, 'Well, 43 percent of the population ' '' And he trails off with a slight laugh.
Mr. Newport is the editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, the face and voice -- on TV news programs, radio broadcasts, newspaper articles and the poll's daily Webcasts -- of the survey, which George Gallup developed here during the Depression. 
 In his third-floor office at the Carnegie Center along Route 1, Mr. Newport reached on a shelf for a dusty volume containing the results of Mr. Gallup's early polls. 
 ''The very first question that he ever asked was about welfare,'' Mr. Newport said, reading from the book. '' 'Do you think expenditures for recovery and relief by government are too little, too great or just about right?' ''
 Sixty percent of the respondents said those payments were too great.
 ''People were opposed to welfare in the middle of the Depression, mind you,'' Mr. Newport said. 
 Mr. Newport, 58, has lived in the Princeton area since he became the poll's editor in 1990, but he was born in Oklahoma and grew up in Fort Worth, where his father was a professor at a Baptist seminary. He went to Baylor, in Waco, Tex., the country's largest Baptist university, and then served in the Texas National Guard. 
 He earned graduate degrees in sociology at the University of Michigan, then taught at the University of Missouri. He got bored and went to work for a talk radio station in Houston, then for a polling company.
 ''I always had that interest in sociology, how people really think,'' he said. 
 In 1986, his Houston company was merged with the Gallup Poll. He moved to Princeton to work for the combined company, now called the Gallup Organization, which makes most of its money doing consumer and marketing research for companies. That helps to support the better-known part of the organization, Mr. Newport's beloved Gallup Poll.
 ''We have had a continuing commitment to an accurate scientific assessment of public opinion,'' he said. ''It is not the profit center of the company, but it is a commitment Gallup makes to the well-being of the democracy.''
 Mr. Newport admitted that was a highfalutin statement, but ''as a whole, I have great respect for the judgment and wisdom of people aggregated together,'' he said.
 Though Mr. Newport is guarded about his own politics, he openly supports one candidate: his wife, Kim, the president of the Hopewell Valley Regional School District Board of Education. They have four children. 
 He is pleased with the broadening of the Gallup Poll's reach in recent years, he said. It does polling for USA Today, and Mr. Newport does a 10- or 15-minute spot with NPR, taped Thursdays, of light banter with a reporter about topics from recent polls.
 Each weekday, the poll's Web site has a four- or five-minute Webcast with Mr. Newport as anchor.
 The big problem in polling these days, Mr. Newport said, is the proliferation of cellphones and the idea that phones no longer indicate your geography. ''Cellphones are just not sampleable in the same way,'' he said, noting that his daughter at Notre Dame has a phone based in New Jersey.
 For now, though, Mr. Newport is satisfied that public opinion research remains scientifically valid and that innovation is unnecessary.
 ''Dr. Gallup wouldn't know what stem cell was,'' Mr. Newport said, ''but it is just a matter of using his kind of question and plugging that in.''
