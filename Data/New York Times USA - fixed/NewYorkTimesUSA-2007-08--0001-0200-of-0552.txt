 BODY:
 SALETAN--Lloyd, a good man, a friend, and a beloved cousin. Luv, Rhoda 
 SALETAN--Lloyd. Lloyd Saletan died peacefully on July 29 after a brief illness. He was 83. A member of the Greatest Generation and a consummate New Yorker, Lloyd spent most of his life in Greenwich Village. He graduated from the Little Red School House and the High School of Music and Art. After serving as a bombardier in World War II, attaining the rank of Second Lieutenant, he graduated from Colgate University (B.A. magna cum laude, 1948) and studied at the London School of Economics (M.Sc., 1952). On retirement from a successful career in finance, Lloyd devoted himself to travel and the arts. He was a tireless theatre-, concert-, and museum-goer, with a special fondness for the opera. He combined profound appreciation with keen critical insight, which he readily shared with others. Lloyd was a generous and enthusiastic guide and host, endearing himself to his neighbors and welcoming visitors from the United States and abroad. He had a unique gift for bringing people together, and was cherished by a wide circle of friends and members of his extended family. Lloyd leaves behind his devoted friend Eddie; many cousins, especially Rhoda Goldberger and Stephen, Eugene, and Anthony Saletan; and a host of other friends.

Here are excerpts from reader replies to David Leonhardt's Aug.1 column on mortgages and the housing market:
 How come the U.K. housing market continues to glide along at rarefied levels? Several years ago, about the time that the predictions of ''unsustainable bubble'' began to first be heard here, there were similar murmurings in the U.K. business press. Here the bubble did burst and it looks like we have at least a few more years to go before the excess gets completely worked out of the market. In the U.K., from what I understand (and my brother in law is Brit and a small-time real-estate investor) the market just keeps going, there has not been any retrenchment, and I don't recall that one hears much talk about potential bubbles anymore. Are there structural differences between the U.K. and the U.S. that could account for this? 
 -- Michael Bliss
 Great question. If anyone has thoughts, please e-mail me at leonhardt@nytimes.com
 -- David Leonhardt
 Is the macroeconomic consequence of someone losing their home different from when they lose say, $100,000 in the stock market? It seems that they still will need a home and will pay rent which will be not far different from their mortgage payment. The house they ''lost'' is still there, although owned by someone else and presumably sold or rented fairly quickly. Although of course the personal trauma for individuals could be great, the overall effect on the economy doesn't seem as bad as other ''losses''. Another example: wrecking a car is a total loss of value to the overall ''wealth'' of the nation but again, but the ''lost'' house is still an economic asset and wouldn't affect the broader economy in the same way.
 -- Norman Dill
 I have seen these issues up close and personal. When I was trying to sell my quaint, character-laden first house in 1989, there was a new development of freshly built homes on the market, offered at low prices. Not a huge number, maybe a dozen or so. I learned well then that prices of all houses are determined by what is selling lowest. I believe the term of art is ''at the margin.'' As the banks try to unload these foreclosed-upon homes at low prices (because no one can get a ridiculous mortgage anymore), I expect the prices of all homes to decrease -- not just the ones with funky financing and effete owners.
 -- Bennett Ojserkis
 Maybe it's time for banks to offer deferment of, possibly, 50 percent of the reset interest increases you speak of either in the form of negative amortization, or as a separate loan. With a long enough term, the housing market should stabilize and home values should increase, which would support the deferment decision. People could stay in their homes and banks could avoid massive foreclosures.
 -- Harold Zuckerman
 All these people with current or future mortgage problems must have credit-card debt too. What's going to happen to the collateralized credit-card-debt market? Isn't that going to take the next hit?
 -- Theodore O'Neill

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Taxes in the Global Economy'' (editorial, July 25), about the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which allows companies to bring back foreign-held profits at a lower tax rate: 
 The implication that Schering-Plough inappropriately used funds repatriated under this law while carrying out ''mass layoffs'' is unfair. The repatriated funds were a critical, and necessary, element in the successful turnaround of this company, which at that time was under severe financial stress.
 Thanks in large part to the repatriated funds, Schering-Plough's new management was able to invest in important and expensive new clinical trials for compounds that have the potential to save millions of lives. These include new treatments for H.I.V./AIDS, hepatitis C and the prevention of heart attacks and stroke. 
 We have rescued and revitalized a vital engine of pharmaceutical innovation while saving and creating high-quality jobs in the United States. Our people would be the first to tell you that. Thomas P. Koestler

HEADLINE: Following in Lafayette's Footsteps, or Rather, His Wake

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: ROCHEFORT, France, July 29 

 BODY:
Piece by piece, a graceful structure of whimsy and magic is taking shape in this old river port, fulfilling the dream of a group of seafaring Frenchmen to honor a founding father of French-American friendship.
 For a decade now, historians, architects, carpenters, boat builders, craftsmen and blacksmiths have lovingly -- if slowly -- sought to recreate the Hermione, the 145-foot, 32-gun, three-masted frigate that in 1780 carried a young French nobleman known as the Marquis de Lafayette on a 38-day voyage to Boston. 
 Lafayette had already made his reputation, fighting for the cause of American liberty alongside Gen. George Washington against the British. The mission this time was to bring word that King Louis XVI would send a half-dozen ships and 5,000 infantry soldiers to help the rebels. 
 The lean warship, known for its speed, moved on to take part in the final battles of Chesapeake Bay and the decisive fall of Yorktown in 1781. Two years later, it met an inglorious demise, crashing on a sandbar and sinking off the coast of Brittany.
 It took six months and more than a thousand workers to build. Today, with an average of a dozen workers on-site, it will take at least four more years to complete the replica, which the organizers promise to sail on Lafayette's route, perhaps with a joint French and American crew. 
 Until then, its curved oak frame sits impatiently in a cavernous 18th-century cobblestone dry dock. A three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle that will eventually have 400,000 pieces, it is Rochefort's top tourist attraction and the focus of an ambitious trans-Atlantic fund-raising campaign.
 ''Every little piece of wood is like a sculpture!'' exclaimed Craig Roberts Stapleton, the American ambassador to France, donning a hard hat and descending into the cargo hold last Friday. He delivered remarks -- in respectable French -- about his pride in the Hermione, which already flies the flags of France and the United States. 
 Now is a good time to gin up support for the Hermione. Sept. 6 is the 250th anniversary of the birth of Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier (a k a the Marquis de Lafayette). 
 The event will be celebrated in the United States, where schools, bridges, streets, squares, cities and towns have been named after the Revolutionary War hero. Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., which is planning an entire year of festivities, has even arranged with Hermes to produce a Lafayette commemorative silk scarf that will be sold exclusively in the United States for $325.
 The French will follow with their own celebrations in December, including a dinner-debate sponsored by France's defense minister, meetings of French and American businessmen, academic conferences and a flood of publications. Members of Congress and the mayors of 30 American cities and towns named after Lafayette have been invited.
 But it is in Rochefort, a town of 27,000 people 250 miles southwest of Paris, near the Bordeaux wine country, that Lafayette fever -- and the stakes -- run highest. 
 The depressed river port was once the thriving center of France's naval shipbuilding industry, but never recovered economically from the closing of the navy arsenal in the 1920s. 
 Determined to revive the town, a handful of local figures and sailing enthusiasts came up with the Hermione II idea over a wine-filled dinner on the site in 1992. 
 Benedict Donnelly, a public relations executive and recreational sailor whose American father had been a liaison officer for Gen. George S. Patton during D-Day, was picked as president of the organization they created: the Association Hermione La Fayette. 
 One challenge to the builders was that the French had no blueprints of the boat. The project's marine historian eventually tracked down British-drawn plans for one of the three sister frigates of the Hermione in Greenwich, England. The plans were drawn after the British captured the frigate, the Concorde, in a battle in 1783. 
 Another problem has been the financing. The $22 million needed to build the boat has come from local and regional French governments, the European Union, private and corporate sponsors and ticket and gift shop sales.
 In the fall, the Association Hermione La Fayette will raise an additional $5.5 million in the United States to equip the boat with modern navigational equipment and to pay for the trip across the Atlantic. 
 Even with cranes and electric saws and drills doing some of the work once done by hand, younger carpenters had to be taught 200-year-old methods of boat-building -- such as using iron chisels and hammers to wedge long strands of hemp as filler between the wooden planks. 
 There is disagreement on what fabric to use for the sails (the woven hemp of the original would be too heavy). The cannons and cannonballs, which will be made in a lighter cast iron than the originals, have yet to be forged. 
 But the most serious problem by far has been the shortage of mature oak trees -- with just the right natural bends in their trunks -- needed to form the wishbone-shaped ribs, curved beams and planking of the boat. For authenticity, the builders decided to use only oak from France, and have had to trek through forests as far away as the royal domains of Versailles and Fontainebleau. 
 ''Everyone was overoptimistic,'' said Jean-Luc Durand, a fifth-generation wooden-boat builder who serves as chief carpenter. ''You can't just build a boat the way you can build a chateau or a cathedral. We're building something that has to float.'' 
 Meanwhile, for a few euros, visitors can get up close to the construction. They can watch workers massage the planks with oils and fill in crevices with black tar. They can learn how the crew took turns sleeping in narrow hammocks, how fresh meat was reserved for officers and ill crew members, and how the gunpowder and barrels of water and wine were stored. 
 At nearby sites, carpenters do a show-and-tell, in which they build accessories such as chicken coops and rowboats, and carve pulleys out of elm; blacksmiths hand-forge bolts, hooks and pins that will be used on the boat.
 The process itself has created a new tourist industry here. 
 ''Hermione has brought life to Rochefort, and there's no reason why we have to finish it tomorrow morning,'' said Jean-Francois Fountaine, the head of a catamaran-building company and a world-class ocean racer. ''But when the Hermione sails, we'll build another!''

HEADLINE: New Interest in Bridgeport's Neglected Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn. 

 BODY:
Not long after John M. Fabrizi was elected to a full term as mayor in 2003, he joined with business leaders in inviting the Urban Land Institute, a research organization sponsored by the real estate industry, to advise Connecticut's poorest city on how to turn itself around. 
 Mr. Fabrizi, who had taken over as mayor after his predecessor, Joseph P. Ganim, was convicted of bribery, was under pressure to get results for the city's dispirited residents.
 Give up the dream of reviving your industrial past, an Urban Land Institute panel, headed by the former Indianapolis mayor William H. Hudnut III, urged the city in early 2005. Focus on your assets: your waterfront, your diverse population, your historic downtown and your easy access to transportation. Make your economic development process transparent, professional and fair. And try to get more housing and retail for the city.
 Mr. Fabrizi and other officials took much of this advice to heart, and now they say their efforts are paying off. Last month, the city announced its selection of two prominent companies to build a $222 million mixed-use project on a vacant 11-acre site just south of Interstate 95. 
 They are Vornado Realty Trust, a large publicly traded real estate investment trust that owns or manages more than 56 million square feet of commercial space, and Canyon-Johnson Urban Funds of Beverly Hills, a private equity fund that has invested nearly $1 billion across the country, focusing on densely populated areas with many minority residents. 
 The site, once home to an Underwood Typewriter factory and the Pequonnock public housing project, which was razed after it became unmanageable and obsolete, is opposite the city's new Harbor Yard ballpark and hockey arena and within easy walking distance of downtown. Another piece of the land to be developed is just south of the railroad tracks. 
 The Vornado team, which includes two other experienced real estate companies -- Mid-City Urban of Silver Spring, Md., and Crescent Hotels & Resorts of Fairfax, Va. -- beat out a group led by Archstone-Smith, a national apartment building real estate investment trust. 
 That major companies are vying to invest in Bridgeport is a sign that there is plenty of money to be made in inner-city neighborhoods that developers and retailers have ignored for decades. 
 Residents of neighborhoods with the largest minority populations spend an estimated $122 billion a year on retail purchases, according to the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, a nonprofit organization founded by Michael E. Porter, a Harvard Business School professor. But the group estimates that an additional $40 billion could be spent in these neighborhoods if there were more stores and restaurants.
 The limited competition means that inner-city investment is actually less risky than suburban development, said K. Robert Turner, who established the Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund in 1999 with Earvin Johnson, who was known as Magic when he played for the Los Angeles Lakers. 
 The developer of a shopping center in a retail-saturated suburb is speculating that people will want to shop there, Mr. Turner said. By contrast, ''we are fulfilling existing demand,'' he said. ''We're not trying to create a market.'' Among the fund's principal investors are the California State Teachers' Retirement System and the New York City Employees' Retirement System.
 Mr. Turner avoids projects that seem likely to become bogged down in rezoning, which could tie up capital for years, and he gravitates toward cities with active political leadership. He and Mr. Fabrizi were brought together by the actor John Ratzenberger, a Bridgeport native. ''We never looked hard at Bridgeport until I got a call from Fabrizi saying, 'Let me drive you around,' '' Mr. Turner said. ''We spent six months getting to know Bridgeport.''
 The proposed project, known as Bridgeport Sound, is still in its early stages, and details still need to be worked out before a land disposition agreement can be signed.
 The site, owned by the city and the Bridgeport Housing Authority, could accommodate as much as 2 million square feet of development. The plans call for apartments with rents in different price ranges, big-box and other retailing, a hotel, and a movie theater or another youth-oriented entertainment destination.
 In addition, the developers will be required to fulfill part of a court mandate by building 50 units of public housing to replace some of those lost when the housing project was torn down. What gave the Vornado team the edge over Archstone-Smith was its willingness to integrate the new public housing units with the other elements of the project, said Nicholas A. Calace, executive director of the housing authority. 
 As city leaders envision it, the development will incorporate New Urbanist principals, including sidewalks, green space and traditional architecture with varied facades that will blend in easily with existing downtown buildings.
 The idea is to knit the project with the business district just across the highway and to encourage people to walk half a mile in the opposite direction, to the 325-acre Seaside Park on Long Island Sound, said Kevin Nunn, president of the Bridgeport Economic Resource Center, a nonprofit business group that has helped the city attract real estate investment. He said the project was expected to receive far less public financing than any previous Bridgeport development has.
 Mr. Nunn sees Seaside Park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, as the city's greatest asset for encouraging young people to stay in Connecticut rather than leave in search of cheaper housing. Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, is formulating a plan for its downtown to bring some of Hoboken's vibrancy to the city by positioning it as a low-cost alternative to New York City, an 80-minute train ride away. 
 ''Young people are leaving the state in droves,'' said Nancy L. Hadley, the city's director of planning and economic development. ''What the downtown plan is saying is, 'We can make it so you feel comfortable staying here.' ''
 Some of that housing is being developed by Urban Green Builders, a New York company that is converting the former Citytrust bank building on Main Street into nearly 120 housing units with 30,000 square feet of retail space. 
 Alicia Glen, the managing director of Goldman Sachs's urban investment group, which is Urban Green's financial partner for the Citytrust and other conversions, said that at this stage of Bridgeport's recovery, relatively small-scale development was preferable to an ambitious project like the one proposed for the Pequonnock site. 
 ''What we're trying to do is revitalize Main Street,'' she said. ''Investing in projects of that scale makes strategic and economic sense given where the city is in its development cycle.'' Some of the storefronts on Main Street are boarded up, and there are few shops, apart from a Rite Aid drugstore and a few fast-food restaurants.
 Ms. Glen said it was unlikely that the Pequonnock project would move forward before Mayor Fabrizi leaves office. After acknowledging past alcohol and cocaine problems, Mr. Fabrizi said he would not run again in November. Lack of political continuity could add to the risk, Ms. Glen said, if there were turnover in the city's office of planning and economic development. 
 Mr. Fabrizi expressed confidence that the progress he helped set in motion would outlast his administration. The once-bankrupt city now has its highest bond ratings since 1982, he said. ''The city is moving in the right direction,'' he said. ''It'sonly going to get better.''
 Mr. Fabrizi said he would push hard to get the Pequonnock agreement signed. ''I want to get it done before I leave,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Continue to Rise, With a Close Above $78

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The great oil rally, now in its fourth year, shows no sign of slowing down. 
 Oil prices reached a record yesterday, exceeding last summer's peak. Light, sweet crude oil futures for September delivery ended at $78.21 a barrel, up $1.38. It is the highest closing price since oil contracts began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983. 
 Many analysts expect oil prices to keep rising this year. The previous high of $77.03 was set in July 2006 at the onset of Israel's war in Lebanon. During yesterday's trading session, oil rose as high as $78.28 a barrel, falling a few pennies short of last year's trading high of $78.40. Unlike last year's jump, the gains on energy markets these last few weeks have not been caused mainly by geopolitical tensions, although these have not disappeared in Iraq, Iran or Venezuela. Rather, the latest surge is the result of tighter market conditions this summer and concerns about insufficient supplies. 
 Oil prices have risen by 28 percent since the beginning of the year. But that has not slowed the strong growth in oil consumption, bolstered by economic growth in the United States and Asia. Meanwhile, energy supplies have struggled to catch up while a spate of shutdowns at American refineries has crimped production at the busiest time of the year for gasoline.
 ''The bottom line is the market has tightened up for good,'' said Jan Stuart, an energy economist at UBS. ''From a crude oil fundamental perspective, we're not at the middle of the up cycle yet. We've got a ways to go.'' 
 Paradoxically, gasoline prices in the United States have been falling in recent weeks, despite the rise in oil, as domestic refineries have increased their output. The average price for gasoline nationwide is now $2.88 a gallon. 
 Global oil consumption, meanwhile, is expected to keep growing and reach 86 million barrels a day this year, 1.5 million barrels more than in 2006, according to the International Energy Agency, an adviser to industrialized countries. 
 Within five years, the energy agency estimates demand reaching nearly 96 million barrels a day. In a recent report, it warned of a ''supply crunch'' if oil supplies fail to keep up with the pace of growth in demand.
 Traders so far seem to have shrugged off questions about the resilience of the American economy. Last week, the Commerce Department said that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the second quarter, faster than analysts had expected. 
 ''It's a period of uncertainty,'' said Antoine Halff, an energy analyst at Fimat. ''There are mixed signals on the oil market as there are in the broader economy. You have signs that the economy is resilient, and at the same time there are concerns about inflation and about the stock markets.''
 ''There has been a very strong shift in market sentiment; everyone is bullish now,'' Mr. Halff said, referring to the oil market.
 A report by Deutsche Bank said yesterday that Chinese oil demand would rise strongly next year as the Beijing Olympic Games bolster the country's economy. Chinese oil consumption, which last year was 7.16 million barrels a day, is expected to grow by an annual 6 percent over the next two years. By 2015, Deutsche Bank estimates China's oil demand at 10 million barrels a day.
 The rising oil prices prompted a senior OPEC official to suggest earlier this week that the oil cartel might act before its next scheduled meeting if prices reached $80 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls about 40 percent of global oil exports, next meets in Vienna on Sept. 11. 
 But OPEC's members appear divided over what to do next. The group's most hawkish members, like Iran and Venezuela, oppose increasing output. Iran's oil minister, Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh, said on Sunday that he did not expect OPEC to consider changes to its output at its next meeting. 
 But Abdalla Salem el-Badri, OPEC's secretary general, suggested on Monday that OPEC could release some of its spare capacity to drive down prices.
 ''A price above $80 also wouldn't make us particularly pleased,'' Mr. Badri said in an interview on Monday in the Austrian financial daily Wirtschaftsblatt. ''We're constantly monitoring the market and are therefore ready to adjust production if circumstances warrant this.''
 Thanks to last year's high prices, OPEC's 12 members enjoyed a 22 percent jump in their petroleum exports, to $649.5 billion in 2006 compared with those in the previous year, according to the organization's annual report, released yesterday. The group's total oil production, including that of the latest member Angola, was relatively flat at 32 million barrels of oil a day last year, up a mere 280,000 barrels a day from the previous year.
 Mr. Badri estimated OPEC's untapped production level at 3.5 million barrels a day.
 But few analysts think that the oil-producing cartel has much capacity to act. The International Energy Agency estimates that OPEC's sustainable spare capacity is 2.8 million barrels a day, much of it in Saudi Arabia. 
 Even at today's levels, oil futures are still about $10 a barrel short of the all-time inflation-adjusted peak set in 1981. Oil prices would have to rise to about $90 a barrel to exceed that record. 
 But that prospect does not seem so distant -- or inconceivable -- anymore. 
 Goldman Sachs analysts warned in a recent report that without swift action from Saudi Arabia, oil prices could rise above $90 a barrel this fall. They said that an increase in OPEC production could help push prices down by $5 to $10 a barrel.
 Some analysts said they were surprised by the market's rapid gains this year. 
 ''This uptrend that has been in place since 1998 has not ended yet,'' said Tom Bentz, a senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas. ''It's been nearly 10 years now in this bull market and we still have to see higher prices.''

HEADLINE: A Rise in Confidence Amid Mild Inflation

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Personal spending rose at its slowest rate in nine months in June while inflation moderated, but consumers' mood brightened considerably in early July, data showed yesterday.
 Despite a rise in income, personal spending rose a slight 0.1 percent in June after posting 0.6 percent gains in April and in May, according to a Commerce Department report that suggested falling home prices and high gasoline costs were pinching consumers.
 That was well below Wall Street economists' forecasts and was the weakest since last September, when spending declined. 
 But the report also contained positive news about inflation. A closely watched inflation indicator has been rising over the last 12 months at its slowest rate in three years.
 The Federal Reserve has held benchmark interest rates steady for more than a year in hopes that persistent inflation would ease.
 The indicator, the core personal consumption expenditures price index -- which excludes food and energy -- rose 0.1 percent on the month and 1.9 percent on the year, the smallest year-on-year increase since March 2004. The overall price index rose 0.1 percent on the month and 2.3 percent on the year.
 Incomes grew in June by 0.4 percent, matching May's increase, with its wages and salaries component advancing a solid 0.5 percent.
 The prospects for continuing income gains in a solid job market appeared to buoy consumer spirits as July got under way, despite concerns about problems in the subprime mortgage lending sector.
 A report from the Conference Board in New York showed consumer confidence hit a six-year high of 112.6 in July -- its highest since August 2001.
 ''It is quite noticeable that consumers are significantly more positive about employment,'' said David Sloan, an economist with 4CAST, a market research firm in New York. ''That might have people wondering if the employment report is going to be strong in July.''
 The Labor Department is scheduled to issue its July employment report on Friday.
 In separate data, the Labor Department said second-quarter employment costs had risen by 0.9 percent, slightly faster than the first quarter's 0.8 percent rise, as benefits climbed sharply.
 But in the 12 months through June, employment costs were up 3.3 percent, moderately lower than the 3.5 percent increase in the 12-month period that ended in March and therefore unlikely to trouble the Fed.
 Another sign of the problems facing the housing industry came in a Commerce Department report showing that construction spending fell 0.3 percent in June, as more commercial building failed to offset declines in home building.
 Spending on private residential construction slipped 0.7 percent to a $544 billion annual rate, the lowest since March 2004 and the 16th consecutive month that spending to build homes has declined.
 Analysts said the slower pace of consumer spending would bear watching since spending drives two-thirds of national economic activity.
 ''The worry is that consumers have finally decided that saving is good and spending everything may not be the way to salvation,'' said one economist, Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
 The concern was offset to some degree by the confidence estimate issued by the Conference Board.
 John Spinello, a Treasury bond strategist for Jeffries and Company in New York, noted: ''As someone said, you can't spend confidence, but this is a pretty huge number.''

HEADLINE: Hempstead Village Divided on $2 Billion Comeback Plan

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., July 31 

 BODY:
For centuries this village was the center of activity on Long Island, until modern suburbia exploded around it and decay set in.
 Now the beleaguered community is agonizing over a $2 billion comeback plan -- one of the largest that Long Island has ever seen -- that would rip up a swath of downtown and replace it with 2,500 condominiums, 600,000 square feet of stores and a performing arts hall.
 The debate over the plan has been intense, drawing overflow crowds to hearings lasting long into the night and sharply dividing the Village Board. Just this week, a vote to select a developer was scheduled for Monday, rescheduled for Wednesday and delayed again without a decision on a new date. In an earlier phase, the fractious board voted 3-2 against the project, then reversed itself and voted 3-2 in favor. 
 Proponents like Mayor Wayne J. Hall Sr. call the proposed project an antidote to sprawl, a model center where people could live, work, shop and dine in the same neighborhood. 
 ''It could be transformative -- it could make a 'there' there,'' said David M. Kooris, a suburban specialist for the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit policy group that he said was ''definitely enthusiastic.''
 As Steve Rao, who hopes his Main Street Wireless cellphone store will be in the new center, put it, ''For us it will be a great thing.''
 But not everyone here is so enthusiastic, especially those who fear the flip side of urban renewal, displacement and gentrification. ''They want to knock all this stuff down, but what happens to the people who have been here for years?'' said Sherry Smalls, a bus driver, who was standing in her front yard. ''They want to build new homes, but who knows if we could afford them?''
 Mayor Hall wants the board to designate Urban America, a Manhattan-based, minority-controlled company with projects in several states, as the developer. Some critics have called for new proposals from other bidders.
 Across Long Island, many villages are trying to revive their sagging downtowns, but the breadth of Hempstead's plan stands alone. ''This is a megaproject,'' said Eric Alexander, executive director of Vision Long Island, a nonprofit planning group. ''We found nothing else to compare and contrast it to.''
 Everyone here agrees that something needs to be done; the issue is just how much. Some residents are totally for or against the plan, while many others are pushing just for revisions.
 ''The area needs to be revitalized, and I would support it if they make certain changes,'' said Joseph Gill, a co-chairman of the local chapter of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.
 Mr. Gill demands that half of the condominiums be reserved for lower-income housing, instead of the 5 percent planned, although the mayor insists the 5,400 apartments already in the village are sufficient.
 The Village of Hempstead, incorporated in 1853 and part of the much larger Town of Hempstead, is New York's oldest and most populous village, with nearly 57,000 residents. It dates to a time when stagecoach lines converged here and the likes of George Washington visited. It later was home to some of the Vanderbilts and the inventor Peter Cooper. 
 Known as the Hub, Hempstead flourished into the 1960s. Abraham & Straus was a top-grossing department store, and the 2,436-seat Calderone Theater was a showplace for movies and concerts. ''For Long Island, it was the focal point, the big city,'' said Desmond Ryan, director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a developers' group.
 A ''destination'' was how Patrick Duggan, Nassau County's deputy executive for development, recalled it. ''A big outing for us was to come to A&S,'' Mr. Duggan said. ''I got my suits at Robert Hall, and on a really special occasion, we'd have dinner at Cooky's Steak Pub.''
 All those businesses are long gone. ''But that could happen again,'' he said.
 Hempstead fell on hard times as suburbs like Levittown and shopping malls like Roosevelt Field sprang up, sucking the vitality out of downtown. ''The whole mentality of shopping changed,'' said Richard V. Guardino, executive dean of Hofstra University's Center for Suburban Studies.
 As the white residents fled to the newer suburbs, blacks and then Hispanics moved in. Poverty grew and taxes rose. There was also an increase in crime and a decline in school performance.
 The renewal plan would bulldoze 26 acres along Main Street, an area peppered with empty lots and boarded-up buildings. Among the properties that remain are a few homes, a car repair shop, a nail parlor, a bodega, storefront churches and a store selling pornographic videos -- what Mr. Duggan calls a mishmosh.
 ''You hear the schools are bad, you hear people are getting shot, and we do have those problems,'' Mayor Hall said. ''But we can work on those problems while giving a jump-start to the economy and bring life back to our downtown. That's why I'm so gung-ho.''
 The project would create 5,200 construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs and yield $35 million a year in badly needed taxes, the mayor says. 
 Some critics question whether services like the sewer and water systems could accommodate the project, issues that the mayor has said will be studied and addressed. Others oppose the heights proposed for some of the buildings, which could be as tall as 16 floors -- an anomaly for a region where growth has been horizontal, not vertical. But Edward Scott, a vice president of Urban America, said that height and density could also be modified.
 But Don Ryan, the sole Republican and only white member of the Village Board, said he was still not satisfied. ''If I wanted to live in Queens, I'd move there,'' he said. ''I'd like Urban America more if they were suburban America.''

HEADLINE: To Ford, a Disaster. To Edsel Owners, Love.

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

DATELINE: KINGSTON, N.Y., July 31 

 BODY:
Martin Lennox took out an ad in the local paper to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the day his car rolled off the assembly line. Then he gave a party.
 Mr. Lennox's friend Steve Wyckoff arrived with a present, a bottle of transmission fluid. And, between swallows of soda and bites of chocolate-covered cupcakes, Mr. Lennox's granddaughter Mercedes explained that she was named for an actress, not a car. 
 Certainly not Mr. Lennox's, which sat, gleaming, outside the garage he has rebuilt around it. It is not just another relic from the days when Detroit's designers favored sofa-size back seats, blindingly shiny bumpers and two-tone paint jobs. Mr. Lennox's car is a 1958 Edsel. 
 To business-school types and drivers old enough to remember, the Edsel was such a disaster that it became synonymous with failure. But not to Mr. Lennox, who once gave a pair of Edsel earrings to his wife, Sharon. And not to Mr. Wyckoff. He owns 24 Edsels, although he drove a Toyota Tercel to the party.
 They are regulars at gatherings of the Empire State Chapter of the Edsel Owners Club -- ''we have them close to where the president lives, and thankfully, I'm the president,'' Mr. Lennox said. But they did not bother with the 50th anniversary celebration last weekend organized by three national Edsel owners' groups in Dearborn, Mich.
 Mr. Lennox, 63, a former telephone equipment technician who retired last year, said his Edsel was the 1,234th made. It had 59,602 miles on the odometer before he let the engine warm up -- ''that's a big hunk of iron, and it likes to be hot'' -- and took it for a spin on Monday. For the record, the engine produces 345 horsepower, 5 more than a modern-day Chrysler 300 with a Hemi engine. 
 Mr. Lennox aimed the long hood with the ''E'' ornament on the end -- his car is longer than many sport-utility vehicles, and weighs 4,479 pounds. Rounding a corner and passing a monument he helped restore when he was commander of the local American Legion post, he said he enjoyed driving a car that has become a head-turner. 
 ''And,'' he added, ''I'm not a boastful person.''
 But there is something contrarian about indulging one's infatuation with the Edsel, which was discontinued only two years after the Ford Motor Company introduced it as mid-priced competition for the likes of Oldsmobile and DeSoto. Mr. Wyckoff talked about using one of his Edsels as his daily car and being pulled over by a police officer who had seen him go by the day before, and the day before that, and maybe the day before that. 
 ''I'm tired of seeing this Edsel,'' the officer told him. 
 No problem, Mr. Wyckoff told the officer: ''I've got one for every day of the week.''
 The Edsel was one of those ugly ducklings that never had a swan phase. ''The Edsel was aesthetically against every single aspect of what, visually, a car should look like,'' said Matt Haig, the author of ''Brand Failures: The Truth About the 100 Biggest Branding Mistakes of All Time'' (Kogan Page, 2003). ''It was ugly next to Chevrolets and other cars that were looking quite beautiful.''
 And then there was the name. Never mind that Edsel Ford had been Henry Ford's only son. ''People had word associations of 'pretzel' or 'weasel,' '' Mr. Haig said. ''It didn't have the soaring, almost poetic evocation of, let's say, 'Thunderbird.' '' 
 Worse, the Edsel's timing was all wrong. Bob Casey, the automotive historian at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., said plans for the Edsel made sense when they were worked out in 1955. But by the time the Edsel was finally introduced in late August 1957 -- after Mr. Lennox's car had already been made -- the United States was heading toward a recession, and the economic headlines were not the only ones that were ominous.
 As a cartoon put it after the Edsel went on sale: ''My, it's a big week for everybody! The Russians have the intercontinental ballistic missile, and we have the Edsel.''
 Things did not get better in 1958. The writer Robert Daines published what he called ''the ultimate Edsel photograph'' on the title page of his book ''Edsel: The Motor Industry's Titanic'' (Academy Books, 1994). It showed Vice President Richard M. Nixon on a trip to Lima, Peru, in May 1958, riding in an Edsel convertible that looked a lot like Mr. Lennox's.
 ''Seconds after this picture was taken,'' Mr. Daines wrote, ''Nixon was pelted with eggs and tomatoes by demonstrators. Nixon later joked: 'They were throwing eggs at the car, not me.' ''
 In all, about 111,000 Edsels were built. There were three model years: 1958, 1959 and 1960. But Mr. Lennox came to Edsels later. He said he decided in the early 1980s that he had to have a car from the late '50s or early '60s. ''Everything I looked at was cheap and in a basket'' -- meaning reduced to parts that would have to be restored -- ''or expensive,'' he said.
 Then he saw a newspaper ad for a 1958 Edsel Citation. ''Wow,'' Mr. Lennox said.
 The seller wanted $3,500 -- ''an awful lot of money.'' He estimated the car's value now at $15,000 to $20,000. ''The engine was filled with rust'' until he had it rebuilt. ''It looks good in photographs,'' he said. ''It's got some flaws, but you can't see them. Like us.''
 Mr. Wyckoff said there were four Edsels at his wedding, in 1978. ''My mother-in-law thought it was ridiculous,'' he said. ''I thought, 'This is not a good start. This is my life.' ''
 ''I never tell people how many I have,'' Mr. Wyckoff said. ''If they suspect I'm crazy, I don't want to confirm it.''

PERSON: Norma Gabler 

HEADLINE: Norma Gabler, Leader of Crusade on Textbooks, Dies at 84

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Norma Gabler, a Texas homemaker who recoiled at material in her children's textbooks and became the public face of a crusade with her husband to rid schoolbooks of content they considered antifamily, anti-American and anti-God, died on July 22 in Phoenix. She was 84.
 The cause was Parkinson's disease, her son James said. 
 From its origins at the Gablers' kitchen table in Hawkins, Tex., in 1961 to its incorporation as Educational Research Analysts in 1973, the mom-and-pop textbook-criticism enterprise grew to occupy a prominent niche in the nation's conservative pantheon. For more than four decades, the couple influenced what children read, not just in Texas but around the country. 
 The reason was Texas' power to be a national template; the state board chooses textbooks for the entire state, and of the 20 or so states that choose books statewide, only California is bigger than Texas. It is difficult and costly for publishers to put out multiple editions, so a book rejected by Texas might not be printed at all. 
 In a 1982 article in The New York Times, Anthony T. Podesta, executive director of People for the American Way, a liberal group, said, ''Texas has the buying power to influence the development of teaching materials nationwide, and a textbook edition chosen for Texas often becomes the sole edition available.''
 The Gablers were first to seize on the Texas textbook process as a means of pushing their conservative principles, and their success baffled and angered civil liberties advocates and progressive educators. Publishers, with much to lose if Texas rejected their books, were often willing to make changes to please the Gablers.
 Richard Morgan, president of Macmillan's school division, said in a 1983 interview with The Times, ''Not making the list in Texas is not a good sign.'' 
 Mrs. Gabler, always with a smile and careful, precise diction, usually testified at textbook hearings rather than her shyer husband, Mel. She argued for more instruction in morality, free-enterprise economics, phonetics and weaknesses in evolutionary theory.
 The Gablers had a two-barreled strategy: in addition to pressing issues of ideology, interpretation and philosophy, the Gablers ferreted out errors of fact. In 2001, Time magazine reported that their ''scroll of shame'' of textbook mistakes since 1961 was 54 feet long. In the early 1990s, Texas fined publishers about $1 million for failing to remove hundreds of factual errors the Gablers had found in 11 history books.
 An example: A textbook said that Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina had supported the tariff of 1816. He opposed it.
 But the Gablers' most important battles concerned bigger issues, like making publishers define marriage as a lifelong union between a man and a woman. 
 The couple's interest in textbooks began when James, at 14, had to memorize the Gettysburg Address and turned to an encyclopedia, he said in an interview. The words ''under God,'' part of the address, were shown in a picture of the Lincoln Memorial, but were omitted in the text as published. His parents blanched.
 Soon, the couple were poring over textbooks, something they said few parents ever did, and finding lots to offend. They raised objections at the local P.T.A.
 Why did a history textbook give more space to the French Revolution than to the American Revolution? Were not Vietnam and Watergate overemphasized? Was Robin Hood a hero, as the text claimed, or a dangerous advocate of income redistribution?
 From the kitchen in Hawkins, about 100 miles east of Dallas, their piles and piles of books and notes spread throughout their house. They worked by what they called the three p's -- prayer, preparation and persistence -- as they geared up for their once-a-year trips to Austin, the state capital, to ride herd on textbooks.
 There, each academic subject -- English, say -- is reviewed on an eight-year cycle in a system established a century ago to create an organized buying system to negotiate lower prices. It was also intended to improve the quality of books used in rural areas.
 Norma Elizabeth Rhodes was born in Garrett, Tex., on June 16, 1923. She did not go to college. Her husband of 62 years, Melvin Nolan Freeman Gabler, went for a year. He worked in the oilfields, served in the Air Force during World War II, was a clerk for 39 years for Esso, now part of Exxon-Mobil, and died in 2004.
 In addition to James, who lives in Phoenix, Mrs. Gabler is survived by another son, Paul, of Houston, and six grandchildren.
 Neal Frey, who has worked with Educational Research Analysts since 1972 and is now president, said that Mrs. Gabler's larger public role was deceptive. 
 ''Mr. Gabler wore the pants in that family, and Mrs. Gabler wanted it that way,'' he said in an interview.
 Together, they were ''the most effective textbook censors in the country,'' Creation/Evolution, a publication of the National Center for Science Education, said in 1982. It went on to point out that while the Gablers derided textbooks that left out alternatives to evolution, they opposed alternative interpretations of American history they deemed negative. They objected to an Edgar Allan Poe story as gruesome. Texts that raised questions without firm answers were suspect.
 Famously, in 1973, they flinched at a fifth-grade American history text that devoted more attention to Marilyn Monroe than to George Washington. 
 ''We're not quite ready for Marilyn Monroe as the mother of our country,'' Mrs. Gabler said.

HEADLINE: Hurricane Victims Rush to Apply For Grants as Deadline Looms

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 31 

 BODY:
Hundreds of Louisianians whose homes were ruined by Hurricane Katrina rushed to meet a Tuesday deadline set by the state's troubled housing aid program, even as a deficit of billions of dollars threatened to leave thousands without a grant. 
 The program, known as the Road Home and financed with federal dollars, has so far provided grants to fewer than a quarter of all applicants. Nonetheless, in recent days applications have been pouring in at the rate of more than 1,000 per day, mostly by phone and Internet, program officials say. 
 The cutoff for applications is July 31, the last chance many here will get for government help to cover losses from the hurricane. 
 Even with the deadline, however, as many as 50,000 homeowners could end up without aid, say Louisiana officials. The shortfall is blamed variously on misjudgments by the state and Washington when the program was designed over a year ago. 
 On Tuesday, a handful of stragglers trickled in to sign up in person for grants of up to $150,000, at a downtown skyscraper and a suburban office park. Road Home officials said phone lines to their offices in Baton Rouge, the capital, were jammed. 
 Each aid applicant told of personal struggle and loss, testimony to the storm's immense ripple effect, two years after it hit. The housing grant, several said, was a last hope. 
 ''It's been frustrating. I tried to do it over the Internet -- it was kind of confusing,'' said Ebony Carey, who said she was now jammed into a two-bedroom suburban apartment with two siblings and six children, after losing her house in the Lower Ninth Ward to the storm. 
 With the program's slow disbursement of $7.5 billion allocated by Washington, thousands of homeowners have been left to their own resources, like personal savings, loans and insurance payouts, to cope with rebuilding. 
 And now, with a potential deficit of up to $5 billion -- though state officials say they may have found up to $2.2 billion of that -- thousands more, out of the more than 170,000 who have applied, could be disappointed entirely.
 ''Many have expectations and desires that exceed the available money,'' said Walter Leger of the Louisiana Recovery Authority. ''The pressure as we approach, with the shortfall looming, is going to be distressing to a lot of people. We're just going to have to work harder.''

HEADLINE: Joint Chiefs Nominee Blames Iraqis for Lack of Progress

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31 

 BODY:
The Navy admiral nominated to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Tuesday that American military efforts in Iraq would fail unless Iraqi leaders did more to bridge sectarian divides. But he also warned that a rapid exit of American troops could turn Iraq into a ''cauldron'' for broader Middle East strife. 
 The failure of the Iraqis to make progress toward political unity imperils Iraq, said the nominee, Adm. Michael G. Mullen, who said that unless things changed, ''no amount of troops in no amount of time will make much of a difference.'' 
 He said he believed that the American troop increase this year in Iraq had helped tamp down violence, saying security was ''not great, but better.'' But he also said that the United States risked breaking the Army if the Pentagon decided to maintain escalated troop levels in Iraq beyond next spring. 
 During more than three and a half hours of often blunt testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, both Admiral Mullen and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the nominee to be vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, were generally praised for giving candid answers about the security and political situation in Iraq. 
 The departing chairman, Gen. Peter Pace, has faced sharp criticism from Congress during his two-year tenure for painting what lawmakers from both parties have described as an overly optimistic portrait of the situation in the country. 
 Admiral Mullen and General Cartwright were nevertheless careful not to stray too far from assessments about Iraq given by other top administration officials, saying they would await a September report from military and civilian officials in Iraq before they could decide on the future of the additional troops there. 
 The officers said the American and Iraqi militaries had made gains against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the homegrown Sunni Arab extremist group that American intelligence agencies have concluded is foreign-led. But General Cartwright said Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia seemed ''to have an unlimited pool from which to draw from.''
 Admiral Mullen, who initially opposed the Bush administration's ''surge'' plan but came to believe that it could work if accompanied by economic development and political reconciliation, was generally unsparing in his criticism of Iraqi politicians. It is imperative, he said, that American officials ''bring as much pressure on them as we possibly can.'' 
 Neither Admiral Mullen nor General Cartwright faced particularly difficult questioning, partly because neither man has been central to the Pentagon's decision making about the Iraq war. Both are expected to be swiftly confirmed by the Senate. 
 Most of the session focused on the future of the Iraq war, a sign of just how much the administration's once grand plans for the military have been altered by the past four years. 
 After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, top administration officials spoke of transforming the military to win quick military campaigns with relatively few combat troops, and become more adaptable to fight terrorist leaders like Osama bin Laden and netwroks like Al Qaeda. On Tuesday, Admiral Mullen made clear that he expected the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to impose a strain on the armed services for years to come. 
 For instance, he said that even if the United States were to cut its force in Iraq by half next year, it would still be another three to four years before it would be possible to guarantee that troops could spend two years at home between combat tours, a deployment tempo that Admiral Mullen said was the goal. 
 Both General Pace and his predecessor, Gen. Richard B. Myers, have drawn intense criticism from Congress for refusing for years to enlarge the military even as troops were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan on multiple combat tours, many of them seeing their tours of duty extended by months. The administration reversed course late last year and announced plans to expand the Army and Marine Corps. 
 Under questioning, Admiral Mullen said that strains on the force could end up dictating military decisions about troop deployments in Iraq. He said that maintaining current troop levels in Iraq beyond next April would force planners to extend tours of duty beyond 15 months, a decision he said he opposed. 
 Admiral Mullen was also questioned on a range of subjects beyond Iraq, and he warned that Iran was aggressively challenging the United States across the Middle East and that it had made a ''strategic shift'' to enter into an alliance in Afghanistan with the Taliban, the militant Sunni Muslim group that Shiite-dominated Iran has long regarded as a foe. 
 Admiral Mullen said he was also concerned about the situation in Pakistan, including the speed with which Al Qaeda has built up a safe haven in the tribal areas near the Afghan border. He said it was a good sign that Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, had sent his military back to the tribal areas, but said he was unsure how effective they will be against entrenched Qaeda operatives.

HEADLINE: Getting a University to Aim Higher

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky. 

 BODY:
A thick loose-leaf book jammed with charts and graphs details Lee T. Todd Jr.'s ambitious plans for the University of Kentucky. But in a recent speech to a chamber of commerce, Dr. Todd, the university's president, summed them up in three brisk words: ''Research drives jobs.'' 
 His own life story encapsulates the idea. Dr. Todd grew up in a small coal-mining and farming town in western Kentucky, graduated from the university and earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at M.I.T. He returned to his Kentucky alma mater to teach before leaving to spend 18 years creating two successful high-tech companies here, in a state better known for thoroughbreds and bourbon than for digital innovations.
 The connection between research and job creation also suggests the scope of Dr. Todd's ambitions. He wants to raise the academic performance and national standing of the university because he thinks that is the best way to improve the state's economy and reduce the scourge of what he calls ''the Kentucky uglies'' -- high rates of diabetes, lung cancer, illiteracy and poverty. 
 ''What the state needs is a more educated work force,'' Dr. Todd told members of the Scott County Chamber of Commerce during an address at a luncheon recently in nearby Georgetown. ''We're going to have to have more graduates in our economy if we want it to grow.'' 
 Plenty of presidents at state universities across the country have come up with plans for growth and improvement. But few have created a strategy as rigorous, statistically driven or transparent as Dr. Todd's, and few bring to the task his sense of mission.
 ''This is really the key: We grow up in Kentucky being told we're not very good, we can't compete,'' he said at the lunch. ''And that's not true.''
 ''My point is that Kentucky needs to have big ideas,'' he added.
 Few ideas are bigger than the one that Dr. Todd, 61, began promoting when he became president in 2001: getting Kentucky into the top 20 among public research universities by 2020. 
 It took 18 months to develop a plan, with the aid of consultants, to enhance the academic reputation of a university best known for its basketball teams, which have won seven national championships.
 The first step for Dr. Todd and his team was to devise their own system for rating state universities. It involves measuring indicators like graduation rates; the academic quality of entering students; the number of Ph.D.'s being produced; the scholarly citations and awards amassed by the faculty members; and the dollar value of federal research grants awarded to the faculty members. Then, they designated benchmarks by which the university's progress could be measured over the years.
 The data showed that the University of Kentucky had a long way to go. Only 60 percent of its students graduate within six years. It has fewer professors and fewer well-paid faculty members than the more prestigious flagship universities whose company it would like to join. By its own system, the university ranks 35 out of 88 public research universities. 
 The plan had no shortage of doubters, including many professors and trustees. Professors were put off by the title of the president's plan -- the Top 20 Business Plan -- and its data-based methodology. 
 ''It smacked of corporate management,'' said Ernest J. Yanarella, a political science professor who has taught at the university for 37 years. 
 But Dr. Yanarella, like many others, ultimately supported the plan because, he said, it was rooted in substantive educational concerns.
 ''What Lee was emphasizing was the critical importance of this university to the economic well-being of the people of Kentucky,'' said Dr. Yanarella, one of two faculty members on the university's board. 
 There are already signs of momentum. The university, which had 45 endowed professorships a decade ago, now has 235. It won $300 million in federal research grants this year, compared with $100 million in 1997.
 Among the research initiatives being championed by Dr. Todd is the development of advanced auto paints, to be used at Toyota's huge assembly plant in Georgetown and at other plants in the region, and the use of tobacco, a local staple, to create advanced pharmaceutical products. 
 Not everyone has lined up behind the plan. Some black faculty members and state legislators were outraged two years ago when the number of black freshmen dropped by 40 percent from the previous year, although it was unclear whether this was a direct result of the plan. Dr. Todd responded by ordering a broader appraisal of applicants, rather than relying solely on grades and standardized test scores, and increasing the amount of financial aid offered to black students. Last fall, the number of black students in the freshman class nearly doubled, compared with 2005.
 But some black professors still remain skeptical of Dr. Todd's efforts. ''I don't think he's opposed to diversity among the faculty, the students and the administration, although his administration is pretty much monochromatic,'' said Roberta M. Harding, a professor of law, who is black. ''But I don't think it's on his radar. I think in his mind, diversity in not an integral part of achieving an elevated academic status.''
 Perhaps Dr. Todd's most significant accomplishment came last year, when he persuaded the Legislature to appropriate an additional $21 million a year for the plan, much of it for raises among faculty members and the hiring of 110 professors. 
 Dr. Todd spends much of his time with legislators, alumni and community groups around the state, selling the plan. His free time, he said, is spent reading, with books on Lincoln a favorite, and with his family -- his wife, Patricia, whom he met in first grade, and their two grown children, each of whom attended the university. He enjoys golf and plays pool once a year at an annual event for students. ''I used to shoot pool a lot,'' he said.
 He is a passionate Boston Red Sox fan, a taste acquired during his years at M.I.T. His research there on cathode ray tubes eventually led to his first commercial venture, a start-up company that produced high-quality screens for flight simulators.
 He acknowledged that he would not be in office long enough to see the top 20 plan realized, but said his intent was to establish a firm foundation.
 ''I don't doubt that we'll be a better university for doing this, whether we achieve it or not,'' he said in an interview.
 And Dr. Todd said the culture of the university was already beginning to change.
 ''I talk to students about not dreaming big enough,'' he said. ''I often tell students I never dreamed of being president of the University of Kentucky. In Kentucky, it's a pretty big deal.''

HEADLINE: Peekskill Finds New Use for an Old Landfill

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
Peekskill, an economically struggling city 40 miles north of Manhattan on the Hudson River, has formed a partnership with a private developer to cap an 11-acre former municipal landfill and build the city's first Class A office space in decades.
 Peekskill, for centuries a vibrant center of trade for a variety of goods from iron stoves to hats, fell onto hard times in the late 1990s, when unemployment and poverty soared and commercial and retail development departed for cities closer to Manhattan, like White Plains. 
 ''Hopefully, this project represents the closure of one era in our city and the beginning of another,'' said Brian Havranek, Peekskill's director of planning.
 This is not the first effort to build atop the landfill, Mr. Havranek said. A local company had considered building its headquarters over the dump several years ago but backed out at the last minute.
 Under the latest deal, which has been more than two years in the making, William Eichengrum, a developer based in Cortlandt, will erect a $45 million two-building office complex on the former dump, which sits next to the Annsville Creek, a scenic waterway popular with kayakers that leads into the Hudson River. The city is supplying the land and tax incentives.
 Construction is to begin in October now that 50 percent of the north building has been leased, Mr. Eichengrum said. Named Hudson View (the upper floors of the buildings overlook a portion of the Annsville Creek that winds past Peekskill), the office park is expected to be ready for occupancy in 2009.
 The two buildings will be glass and steel, and each will offer 93,000 square feet of office space. Mr. Eichengrum's development partnership, called 9 Corporate Drive Peekskill Development, will lease packets of office space 5,000 square feet and larger. He expects that large New York City firms might use the building for back-office operations like data processing and payroll and that lawyers, doctors and other professionals would set up their primary offices there.
 In the past, Mr. Eichengrum has specialized in buying and upgrading mixed-use properties and residential sites, like the Forest Green Cooperative Apartments in Islip on Long Island. The Peekskill project represents his first venture in new office construction.
 The project, which was approved by the city's planning commission on July 10, is being designed by Warshauer Mellusi Warshauer Architects, a 50-year-old family business in Hawthorne. The architects expect that the buildings -- four and five stories -- will be certified under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, program of the United States Green Building Council. 
 ''To be green is to be in vogue,'' said Gary Warshauer, one of the principals in the architecture firm. 
 The structures, which will use geothermal heating and cooling and have photovoltaic rooftop panels to produce electricity from solar energy, are expected to reduce tenants' costs by 40 percent, he said. The buildings have also been designed to limit the amount of water consumed, with high-efficiency plumbing. Outdoors, trees and shrubs were chosen for their erosion-control benefits, the architect said. 
 Because the site is a former city landfill -- it closed in the mid 1970s -- the project will be eligible for state tax breaks. In turn, the developer expects to charge annual rents of about $24 a square foot not including electricity, compared with $30 a square foot or more for comparable Class A office space in the central business district of White Plains. 
 Under the state's Environmental Quality Bond Act, the city will receive $2 million to help pay for the costs of capping the landfill, which are estimated at $8.1 million.
 Frank LaVardera, a principal with Clough Harbour & Associates, an engineering and consulting firm in Albany that has been hired by the developer, said the project was helped by the fact that the landfill is flat. ''It's not your classic characteristic large mound that you see in most landfills,'' he said. ''In this case, the topographic configuration lends itself to what we're planning.''
 The former landfill was used for the disposal of household and municipal solid waste -- but not toxic materials -- from the 1930s to 1974, when it was covered with about two feet of soil, which was the requirement at that time.
 Now, Peekskill is under a consent order from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to seal the landfill. The current project has been designed in collaboration with the State Energy Research Development Authority.
 As part of the incentive to develop the property, Mr. Eichengrum will make payments in lieu of taxes to the city and be entitled to sales and mortgage tax exemptions. Under the agreement with Peekskill's industrial development agency, he will pay $65,000 a year in taxes for five years, and then $68,000 yearly for the next five years. The taxes will gradually increase for 20 years, after which the developer will pay the full amount.
 Mr. Eichengrum, who estimated the tax exemptions to be worth more than $7 million, said the land is being acquired under a 20-year leasehold agreement with the city, after which his company can buy it for $1.
 CB Richard Ellis, a global real estate services firm, has been hired to lure companies to the northern part of the county. Paul Hoffmann, a vice president for the CB Richard Ellis's offices in Stamford, described Peekskill as an ''untapped market,'' conveniently located near the Bear Mountain Bridge and Route 9, a major north-south road. There is also rail service to Grand Central Terminal on the Metro-North Hudson line.
 The city is accessible to residents not only of Westchester County, but also the counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam and Rockland, where housing costs are lower and where there are expected to be many potential clerical and staff employees.
 Mr. Havranek, Peekskill's director of planning, said the landfill conversion project was not the city's only effort to increase its retail and commercial tax base. In another public-private partnership, officials are close to a deal with a developer who plans to built a Target store on a nine-acre parcel of vacant city land, a former junkyard.
 ''That deal will take another old problem from the middle of the last century off our hands,'' he said. ''It's a natural to think about more commercial development, and not just more housing, up here.''

HEADLINE: Private Equity Warns Against Raising Taxes

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31 

 BODY:
Private equity, hedge fund and real estate executives warned senators on Tuesday that raising taxes on their firms would harm a range of companies that benefit from their investments, including developers in poor urban areas. 
 Congress is debating whether to force companies set up as limited partnerships -- and their managers -- to pay taxes at the same rate as income earned by ordinary Americans. Proposed legislation would raise taxes to as much as 35 percent from 15 percent for profit earned by private equity and hedge funds, and fees paid to their managers.
 Though private equity groups and hedge funds could be tempting targets for lawmakers looking to pay for new federal programs, the industry has been lobbying aggressively against the tax increase and crucial senators appear to be listening.
 Several senators said they were interested in a more comprehensive look at changes in taxes, with the possibility of increasing income tax rates for the wealthy. Some were worried about the impact that a tax increase on private equity and hedge funds would have on pension funds that put their money in those investments.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said Tuesday that while he has not taken a position on the issue, he was ''concerned about the potential adverse effects'' on financial markets.
 Advocates of a tax increase said it was unfair for private equity, hedge fund and venture capital fund managers to pay a smaller share of their earnings in taxes than lawyers, doctors or professional athletes. But industry executives say taxing those companies at a lower rate promotes risk-taking and economic growth.
 At Tuesday's Senate Finance Committee hearing, Bruce E. Rosenblum, managing director of the Carlyle Group, a Washington-based private equity firm, argued that changing the tax treatment for private equity managers would have adverse consequences.
 ''There will be deals that don't get done. There will be entrepreneurs that won't get funded and turnarounds that won't get undertaken,'' said Mr. Rosenblum, who also is chairman of the Private Equity Council, an industry group.
 But a Denver venture capitalist, William Stanfill, disputed the argument, saying his colleagues have displayed a ''Chicken Little'' mentality in warning of dire consequences. He noted that venture capitalists are paid very well compared with other industries.
 It makes little sense to tax teachers, chief executives or surgeons at a higher rate than private equity executives, said Joseph Bankman, a law professor at Stanford.

HEADLINE: Ford and G.M. Expect a July Sales Drop

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 31 

 BODY:
Over the last 18 months, General Motors and the Ford Motor Company have cut thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in costs and narrowed their North American losses. That helped each post unexpectedly strong second-quarter profits.
 But those results may be the best that both auto companies can do, at least in the short run, in a challenging auto market beset by foreign competition and economic concerns.
 On Wednesday, G.M. and Ford are expected to report double-digit declines in July auto sales on an unadjusted basis, according to Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying advice. 
 The companies have stepped up incentive programs, like rebates and cut-rate loans, in hopes of clearing out 2007 models in preparation for new models this fall.
 G.M.'s most important coming vehicle is the new version of the Chevrolet Malibu sedan, which follows updated versions of its pickup trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, introduced last winter.
 The trucks' initial sales surge has faltered in the face of high gas prices, slowing home sales and concerns about the broader economy, however, leaving G.M. with soaring inventories of both vehicles at a time when competitors like Toyota are aggressively discounting their trucks.
 Despite that, G.M. largely held off on its own deals until this month, and its decision paid off somewhat on Tuesday. 
 G.M. said it earned $891 million from April through June, or $1.56 a share, compared with a loss of $3.4 billion, or $5.98 a share, in the period a year earlier.
 G.M.'s North American operations -- the centerpiece of its business -- lost $39 million in the quarter. That was a significant improvement from the second quarter of 2006, when losses totaled $3.95 billion in North America. On an adjusted basis, G.M. said it earned $78 million.
 Either way, it essentially broke even in its biggest market, after almost two years of revamping. 
 G.M. has never said when it expects to earn an annual profit in North America. Still, G.M.'s chief financial officer, Frederick A. Henderson, said the company deserved credit for getting this far, especially since it did not anticipate high oil and gasoline prices, a slowdown in the housing market or the problems in credit markets that have occurred since it began its turnaround efforts.
 ''Given that we're breaking even, we've been pedaling pretty fast to get here,'' Mr. Henderson said in an interview. ''But we need to pedal even faster.''
 Mr. Henderson said the second-quarter result stemmed from ''a performance that was less than we were hoping for, certainly in the month of June, for example'' when G.M.'s auto sales fell 24 percent.
 On Wednesday, Edmunds estimated that G.M.'s average incentive rose to $3,130 per vehicle in July, up nearly $300 per vehicle from its level in June. 
 G.M. embarked on a reorganization plan in late 2005 that called for it to close all or part of a dozen plants and eliminate 30,000 jobs over three years. The plan was aimed primarily at stemming G.M.'s red ink in North America, the main reason for a near record loss of $10.6 billion in 2005 and a $2 billion loss last year. 
 Ford, which posted an $750 million profit during the quarter, said last week that it had lost $279 million in North America. It, too, plans to cut jobs -- about 44,000 of them in North America -- and close factories.
 Even so, analysts were pleased that G.M. had positive cash flow of about $1.1 billion during the quarter, although they noted the company had reduced its capital spending plans to about $8 billion a year from a previous forecast of $8 billion to $9 billion annually.
 Jonathan Steinmetz, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, termed the results ''better than expected.'' Neither Ford nor G.M. issues guidance to Wall Street, a reason both companies' second-quarter profits were above analysts' estimates.
 Shares of G.M., which had risen this week on expectations of a strong quarter, fell 21 cents, closing at $32.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. They had risen as high as $34.28 early in the day.
 The brightest news for G.M. came overseas. In Europe, G.M. earned $217 million. Profits reached $227 million in Asia, and $213 million in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. The profit from worldwide automotive operations, including the loss in North America, was $618 million.
 But Mr. Henderson said he was not sure that overseas performance could continue in the current quarter, when sales in Europe, in particular, traditionally decline because customers are on extended summer vacations. 
 ''I used to wake up in terror every morning wondering whether people bought cars in the third quarter,'' said Mr. Henderson, who previously ran G.M.'s European operations. ''You have to have a good first half in order to have a reasonable chance at a reasonable year.''
 He added, ''We're reasonably pleased with the second quarter, but we have a lot of challenge ahead in Europe.''

HEADLINE: Surviving Without Subsidies

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: OHINEWAI, New Zealand 

 BODY:
Watching grass grow is supposed to be dull. But watching it grow with a dairy farmer like Malcolm Lumsden is anything but.
 Cows turn grass into milk, and while dairy farmers in the United States and Europe rely much more on grain to feed cows, here in New Zealand grass is pretty much all they get. The richer and more abundant the grass, the richer and more abundant the milk.
 So like mechanics tuning a race car engine, Mr. Lumsden and his fellow dairy farmers keep close track of the weight of the grass in their pastures, precisely measure its protein and sugar content, and produce computer charts tracking how much they have left to feed their cows through winter.
 ''It's a science,'' Mr. Lumsden mused as he watched a group of his black-and-white Friesians munching dark grass on a wet winter day. ''It's a real science.'' 
 Dairy farming in New Zealand was not always this sophisticated. But ever since a liberal but free-market government swept to power in 1984 and essentially canceled handouts to farmers -- something that just about every other government in an advanced industrial nation has considered both politically and economically impossible -- agriculture here has never been the same.
 The farming community was devastated -- but not for long. Today, agriculture remains the lifeblood of New Zealand's economy. There are still more sheep and cows here than people, their meat, milk and wool providing the country with its biggest source of export earnings. Most farms are still owned by families, but their incomes have recovered and output has soared.
 ''Farming in New Zealand is now a cold, hard business,'' said Mr. Lumsden, who at the time of the farming revolution was president of Federated Farmers in the Waikato region, the heart of New Zealand's dairy country. ''I think we have benefited hugely.''
 New Zealand's farmers are not the only ones convinced that eliminating subsidies, or at least sharply cutting them, is a good idea. As negotiators struggle to revive the failing global trade talks and Congress moves ahead on a new farm bill in the United States, New Zealand and Australia -- which also cut subsidies but not as drastically -- are being extolled by economists and advocates for poor countries as models for Americans and Europeans to follow.
 ''They went cold turkey and in the process it was very rough on their farming economy,'' said Ray Goldberg, a retired professor of agriculture and business at Harvard Business School. ''But they came out healthier and stronger. They proved it could be done.''
 Traditional subsidies, economists contend, generally encourage inefficient farmers to grow unprofitable crops far beyond what consumers actually need, secure in the knowledge that the government will help protect them from loss. And they make it much harder for farmers in poor countries to compete on a level playing field against coddled farmers in the West. Removing subsidies, the argument goes, liberates the best farmers anywhere in the world to produce what people really want.
 ''When you're not going to get paid for what the market doesn't want, you have to get off your backside and find out what they want,'' said Charlie Pedersen, who, when he is not raising sheep and beef cattle on his farm north of the capital, Wellington, is president of Federated Farmers of New Zealand. 
 Just how much the United States can learn from New Zealand is debatable: this country is small and its subsidies and tariffs were a relatively recent indulgence. And unlike the United States, where most farm output is consumed domestically, almost all of New Zealand's milk, meat and wool is sold abroad. 
 ''There's a lot of differences between New Zealand and the United States,'' Tom Buis, president of the National Farmers Union in Washington, said in a telephone interview. ''They are almost completely export oriented, and that's quite the reverse of the U.S.''
 If the United States were to pursue a New Zealand-type strategy, Mr. Buis argued, large corporate entities would end up controlling most farms as smaller farmers went into bankruptcy. ''Those people are going to get financially ruined,'' he said. 
 Whatever the differences, the response in New Zealand's dairy industry to the end of subsidies is broadly instructive. Output has quintupled since the end of subsidies, positioning New Zealand to take advantage of a global boom in demand for dairy products, driven from China and India. 
 With little suitable land available for growing grain, New Zealand's dairy farmers survived by exploiting their environment. Because winters are relatively mild and the country has no predators like coyotes or wolves, it can keep its cows and sheep on pasture year-round with nothing but basic fences to control them.
 ''The reason we've succeeded is we've been low-cost producers,'' said Kevin Wooding, a former chairman of Dairy Farmers of New Zealand who milks about 700 cows in the Waikato's rolling, iridescent hills. ''We kept our grass systems in place.''
 In addition to reducing the need for expensive fuel to transport feed, Mr. Wooding and other farmers here aver that their pastoral system produces healthier animals.
 After growing rich in the early 20th century off the byproducts of its pasture, New Zealand imposed subsidies not so much to protect farming but as part of a plan to insulate its domestic manufacturers from global competition. It offset the costs to its farmers from higher industrial tariffs by giving them subsidies. But farming is not a small part of the economy as it is in the United States; it is the nation's largest, most important sector.
 ''It was wacko,'' said John Yeabsley, a former trade official who is now an economist at the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research in Wellington. ''Who's going to pay for the subsidies?''
 Farmers eventually realized that it was them. They responded to their higher tax burden by maximizing their subsidies. ''The whole thing,'' Mr. Wooding said, ''was a game to try to get as much government money as possible.''
 By the early 1980s, the cost of this system had created a balance of payments crisis for the nation. A newly elected, left-leaning Labor Party government under Prime Minister David Lange took the uncharacteristic step of pushing through a radical set of free market economic plans, with agricultural subsidies the first to go.
 When the government also floated the New Zealand dollar, the currency skyrocketed, costing sales abroad while sending interest rates soaring and land prices lower. More than a few farmers flirted with bankruptcy. Some succumbed.
 As anger mounted, thousands of farmers marched on the capital, letting sheep loose on government lawns and buzzing Parliament with crop dusters.
 Even Mr. Lumsden, who bucked many of his fellow farmers by favoring the end of subsidies, found that his own debts had grown so heavy that he was forced to sell his family farm to the government.
 Faced with a potential avalanche of bankruptcies, farm leaders persuaded New Zealand's banks to write down some of their debt. It made the difference: after fearing that 10 percent of farms would go bust, Mr. Pedersen said, only about 1 percent did.
 Mr. Lumsden was eventually able to buy his farm back from the government -- at a discount.
 As industrial tariffs fell, the benefits of lower equipment costs made themselves felt and farmers were able to expand by buying out struggling operations. As a result, there are more milking cows in New Zealand, but fewer herds. 
 With the world shifting to more health-conscious products, farmers responded by moving away from Jerseys, with milk rich in butterfat, to larger Friesians, which provide more protein-rich milk. To produce the higher-protein milk in a more compact animal, they began crossing Jerseys with Friesians, in a breed now known as the Kiwi cross.
 Today, cows in New Zealand cost less to feed and yield more milk solids, making them more profitable. Dairy farming has become so much more lucrative in the postsubsidy era that many sheep farmers, once even more heavily subsidized, have been shifting to dairy.
 Sheep farmers also responded by becoming more competitive themselves. Farmers reduced the huge herds of mostly small and fatty lambs they had been raising, importing breeds from Finland and Denmark to improve the fertility of their ewes and producing larger, leaner lambs.
 ''The output of 40 million sheep we have today is as great as from 70 million,'' said Tom Mandeno, a director at Meat and Wool New Zealand, who manages 2,500 sheep and 400 beef cattle.
 Australia's experience in eliminating subsidies, though less sweeping, was similar. Dairy production has boomed; government stipends helped ease the exit of less-efficient farmers.
 ''There were a lot of small farmers who were dying very slowly and were going to have to leave the industry anyway,'' said Phillip Goode, manager of international policy at Dairy Australia in Canberra. ''This gave them a way to leave in a financially dignified way.''
 Without government aid, New Zealand farmers have found other ways to deal with the vicissitudes of commodity markets. In 2001, dairy farmers merged two rival cooperatives to form their own purchasing and exporting cooperative, Fonterra, which also gives New Zealand pricing heft in international markets.
 ''I'm very happy with Fonterra,'' Mr. Lumsden said. ''They've taken the peaks and troughs out of the price in the world market.'' 
 Fonterra also drives innovation and product development: New Zealand's dairy farmers have ventured into new lines like antibody-rich milk for the health food and pharmaceutical markets, kosher milk and even chocolate cheese. 
 ''What's happened since the reforms is that you have a new type of farm emerging -- a business farm,'' Mr. Lumsden said. Giving up subsidies made farming harder, he conceded, but introduced the pride that comes of entrepreneurship. ''It made it more enjoyable,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The China Connection: Globalization and the Narcotics Trade

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
For all its global reach, there is something antiquated about the drug trade. The story of a bag of cocaine peddled in an American suburb, for instance, often begins in the Andes, where Quechua and Aymara Indians have harvested coca for centuries. 
 Cooked in nearby labs and transported through Mexico into the United States by Mexican cartels, cocaine's path to market is not unlike that of a shirt -- a straightforward chain from raw material in the third world to finished product in the first. 
 Chemistry, and globalization, are changing this dynamic, however. The unusual case of Zhenli Ye Gon, who was arrested in Maryland last week following the discovery of $205 million of alleged drug money in his house in Mexico City, underscores how the same process of global sourcing that ripped apart the integrated industries of the 20th century, replacing them with networks of production scattered around the globe, is reconfiguring the drug trade, too.
 Mr. Ye Gon, who was born in Shanghai, migrated to Mexico in 1990 and became a Mexican citizen five years ago, is accused of illegally importing into Mexico tons of pseudoephedrine and other chemicals from China and other countries to supply methamphetamine labs run by Mexican drug cartels in Mexico and American border states.
 The new Mexican-made drug has virtually replaced American homegrown meth, which used to be made by small producers that often sourced their pseudoephedrine at the local pharmacy. Seizures of imported meth along the southwest border increased from 2,706 pounds in 2003 to 4,346 pounds in 2005. The number of methamphetamine labs seized nationwide plummeted from 10,212 to 5,846 over the same period. 
 This shift of the meth supply is changing the American market for illegal substances. The National Drug Intelligence Center reports that nearly 40 percent of state and local law enforcement officials nationwide say meth now represents the greatest drug threat to their areas. 
 Stopping large-scale traffickers who can source raw materials anywhere around the globe will make interdiction much more difficult for law enforcement. Mexico has seen a surge in illegal imports of pseudoephedrine from China and Germany. According to officials from the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, India is another source. These shipments are not easy to track. Mexican law enforcement officials noted that many of Mr. Ye Gon's pseudoephedrine shipments to Mexico passed unnoticed through United States ports with fake documents.
 This pattern of global sourcing also points to big changes in the economics of Mexican crime. Following Mr. Ye Gon's arrest, the head of Colombia's national police warned that Mexico and Colombia would have to prepare to do battle against Chinese and Russian organized crime. Mr. Ye Gon is the first Chinese-born to be charged of drug trafficking in Mexico in at least a decade, according to Mexican news media reports.
 But the irruption of Mr. Ye Gon into Mexican drug trafficking is also emblematic of much broader changes as Mexico adapts to China's emergence in the global economy.
 For at least a century, successive Mexican governments have been wary of China. Chinese immigration to northern Mexico in the earlier part of last century was often met with violence. In 1911, troops loyal to general Francisco Villa massacred 250 Chinese in Torreon. In 1921, president Alvaro Obregon passed a law barring future immigration of Chinese workers. In 1931, thousands of Chinese were expelled from the country. Until recently, Mexico's economic ties to China were tenuous, at best. A decade ago, Mexico imported merely $1 billion worth of Chinese products. 
 Yet the bilateral links have grown. Last year, Mexico imported $24.4 billion in Chinese goods. Fears of competition from China, and its enormous and inexpensive labor force, have grown apace. Reports in recent years that some of the maquiladora plants along Mexico's northern border have decamped to China have sent Mexicans into paroxysms of economic anxiety. 
 The saga of Mr. Ye Gon suggests that this rivalry is now extending into the most insatiable consumer market in the world.

HEADLINE: Iraq Snapshots Give 2 Views

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
July ended with a monthly death toll for American troops in Iraq that was the lowest this year. Then August dawned with car bombs in Baghdad that killed scores of Iraqis.
 In war, good news and bad news often coexist. But in Iraq, where battle lines are murky, the snapshots emerging from the American counterinsurgency campaign can seem particularly contradictory. Ever since American troops first rumbled through Iraqi cities more than four years ago, the war has produced both victories and defeats, and most have been short-lived.
 ''Compared with a conventional war, when we can say that we are exactly 50 miles from Berlin, it is extremely difficult in a conflict like this to find data that shows any meaningful trend,'' said Andrew J. Bacevich, a military historian and professor of international relations at Boston University. 
 But that does not stop defenders and critics of the war from trying. With a promised progress report from the top American commander in Iraq now just six weeks away, partisans on both sides of the debate in Washington are searching desperately for evidence to bolster their judgments about the success or failure of the strategy that the Bush administration calls a ''surge.'' 
 The war's staunchest supporters have seized on the reduced death toll in July for American troops as a sign that an influx of troops is dampening sectarian violence in the country. 
 Yet even before the car bombings on Wednesday, opponents of the war were citing reports that the Iraqi civilian deaths were on the rise -- a fact they say belies any notion that the White House strategy is having its intended effect of protecting the Iraqi population.
 They also note that over the past two years, July has generally been a light month for American military deaths. 
 For his part, Adm. Michael G. Mullen of the Navy, nominated to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress this week that none of these statistics would matter in the long run unless Iraqi politicians could mend sectarian wounds. 
 While progress in conventional wars can be measured by the amount of enemy territory captured or the number of cities liberated, the American military has had greater difficulty making such assessments in guerrilla conflicts like Iraq. 
 During the Vietnam War, generals used enemy body counts to trumpet the successes of the military's jungle offensives. The Pentagon says it abandoned this ''metric'' after the defeat in Vietnam, but over the past four years in Iraq, military commanders have often used their numbers for insurgents killed when detailing the success of a particular operation.
 Earlier this year, Congress tried to quantify success or failure in Iraq by mandating periodic White House progress reports on 18 military, political and economic benchmarks. When the first report was issued last month, White House officials stressed the positives and Democrats in Congress accentuated the negatives.
 Perhaps because the report found that the Iraqi government had fallen short on the most significant of the measures, the American ambassador in Baghdad wondered whether this whole benchmark concept was a good idea to begin with. 
 ''The longer I'm here, the more I'm persuaded that Iraq cannot be analyzed by these kind of discrete benchmarks,'' Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker said at the time, in an interview with The New York Times. 
 The task of assessing the American venture in Iraq is further complicated by the fact that the United States is at once trying to snuff out sectarian violence in Iraq, rebuild the country's economy, and bring about political reconciliation. Progress on one of the fronts is often accompanied by backsliding on the other two. 
 The top American general in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, often says that successful counterinsurgency campaigns can sometimes last between 8 and 10 years. But the political calendar is moving much more quickly, as is a sense of urgency within the military that is driven by what planners say is the near-impossibility of keeping 160,000 Americans in Iraq beyond next April without unacceptable burdens on the troops. Congress is expected to vote again as early as September on Democratic-backed proposals that could impose limits in the war. In anticipation of that showdown, proponents of the war have been citing an Op-Ed article in The Times entitled ''A War We Just Might Win'' as a sign that the American military has turned a corner in Iraq. 
 The authors, Michael E. O'Hanlon and Kenneth M. Pollack of the Brookings Institution, have been occasional critics of the Bush administration's war strategy. After a weeklong trip to Iraq, the two authors concluded that gains by the military in recent months had the ''potential to produce not necessarily 'victory' but a sustainable stability that both we and the Iraqis could live with.''
 In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. O'Hanlon said the article was intended to point out that the security situation was currently far better than it was in 2006. What the American military cannot solve, he said, are problems caused by the inability of Iraqis to forge political solutions. ''Ultimately, politics trumps all else,'' Mr. O'Hanlon said. ''If the political stalemate goes on, even if the military progress continued, I don't see how I could write another Op-Ed saying the same thing.''

HEADLINE: Lead Paint Prompts Mattel to Recall 967,000 Toys

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, is recalling nearly one million toys in the United States today because the products are covered in lead paint. 
 According to Mattel, all the toys were made by a contract manufacturer in China. 
 The recall, the second biggest this year involving toys, covers 83 products made from April 19 to July 6. Many of them feature Sesame Street and Nickelodeon characters -- including the Elmo Tub Sub, the Dora the Explorer Backpack, and the Giggle Gabber, a toy shaped like Elmo or Cookie Monster that toddlers shake to hear giggles and funny noises. 
 Mattel says it prevented more than two-thirds of the 967,000 affected toys from reaching consumers by stopping the products in its distribution centers and contacting retailers, like Wal-Mart, Target and Toys 'R' Us, late last week. But more than 300,000 of the tainted toys have been bought by consumers in the United States. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the toys may have a date code from 109-7LF to 187-7LF on the product or packaging.
 A complete list can be found at nytimes.com, mattel.com or cpsc.gov.
 Mattel is hardly the first manufacturer to encounter a breakdown in the Chinese production chain. In recent months, factories in China have been sources of poisonous pet food sold in stores in the United States, dangerous car tires, and lead paint on the popular Thomas & Friends wooden toys.
 The Chinese government has said it is working to improve its product regulations, even as members of Congress have called for legislation requiring more inspections of imports from China.
 This is Mattel's 17th recall in 10 years. Most recently, an infant swing made by its Fisher-Price division was taken off the market because of a risk children could be trapped in its moving parts. And in its largest consumer action involving toy safety, in 1998, the company recalled more than 10 million Power Wheels cars.
 Speaking of the new recall, Nancy A. Nord, acting Consumer Product Safety Commission chairwoman, said in a statement, ''These recalled toys have accessible lead in the paint, and parents should not hesitate in taking them away from children.'' 
 The statement said that the commission had stated an investigation and that ''ensuring that Chinese made toys are safe for U.S. consumers is one of my highest priorities and is the subject of vital talks currently in place between C.P.S.C. and the Chinese government.''
 Earlier this summer, RC2, the maker of Thomas trains, recalled 1.5 million trains and accessories because a Chinese supplier had coated them in lead paint. At that time, consumer safety experts and toy industry analysts said that Mattel was unlikely to face such a problem.
 ''There are companies that live up to their obligations to the government as well as to consumers, and they are one of them,'' Julie Vallese, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said of Mattel in mid-July.
 But Mattel's safety checks -- which include independent audits of facilities and ownership of many of its own factories in China -- did not prevent the chain of events that led to today's recall. 
 In early July, according to Mattel executives, one of the European retailers that sells Mattel toys discovered the lead on some products. On July 6, Mattel stopped operations at the factory that produced the toys and initiated an investigation. 
 On July 18, Mattel took a reporter for The New York Times on a tour of a factory in Guanyao, China, and of Mattel's toy safety lab in Shenzhen. At that time, Mattel executives say, it was unclear whether Mattel was facing a widespread lead paint problem, or if the European case was an anomaly.
 Last Thursday, the same day The Times ran an article about Mattel's toy safety procedures, the company's executives say they received conclusive data that persuaded them to recall the 83 products. Then, the company contacted retailers who stocked the toys.
 ''This is a vendor plant with whom we've worked for 15 years; this isn't somebody that just started making toys for us,'' Robert A. Eckert, the chief executive of Mattel, said in an interview. ''They understand our regulations, they understand our program, and something went wrong. That hurts.''
 Mattel requires the factories it contracts with to use paint and other materials provided by certified suppliers. Mattel executives said they did not know if the contract manufacturer substituted paint from a noncertified supplier or if a certified supplier caused the problem. 
 Mr. Eckert said Mattel was considering various ways to overcome the problem, including reducing the amount of toys it makes through contract factories. About 50 percent of Mattel's revenue comes from toys made in 11 factories it owns and operates. That is a high share for the toy industry.
 But the other half comes from toys that it outsources to up to 50 manufacturers in China. Those toys tend to be short-term products that feature characters from movies and television shows rather than Barbie dolls or other Mattel brands. 
 In light of the recalls, Nickelodeon -- which owns the characters Dora the Explorer and Diego -- has decided to introduce a third-party monitor to check up on all of the companies that make toys under its brands, including Mattel.
 Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization behind the ''Sesame Street'' program, is considering adding third-party testing, Gary E. Knell, president and chief executive of Sesame Workshop, said in a statement.
 This summer, the Toy Industry Association has been working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission on new regulations to require more stringent safety checks. Carter Keithley, president of the association, said the federal government needed to help the industry block China from using lead paint. 
 ''We don't have lead paint in this country any more, and they shouldn't either,'' Mr. Keithley said of China. ''If there was no lead paint, then we wouldn't have this problem.''
 Thomas G. Rawski, an economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh, who has visited factories in China regularly since 1975, though not toy factories, said companies there are trying to check product quality, but more improvements are needed.
 ''The mechanisms for preventing this stuff don't leap out of a tree,'' Mr. Rawski said. ''They have to be built up carefully, and I think it's very clear this process of building is going on in China right now. That means there are lots of things happening that in an ideal world shouldn't be happening, including things that wouldn't happen in Japan or the U.S.''

HEADLINE: And Now, Folks, Behold The 15-Minute Publisher

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In the Middle Ages, a book was a big production. It might take a year for a monk to copy a manuscript, which is Latin for ''written by hand,'' onto a specially prepared calf, sheep or goat skin and then to decorate it with silver or gold.
 In the mid-15th century, Johannes Gutenberg, a German goldsmith, sped up book production considerably with the invention of movable type. A single book page might take half a day, faster if workers showed industry. 
 Today, the book business is faster still, but few things are as fast as something called the Espresso Book Machine, the product of a high-tech publishing venture that has nothing to do with caffeine.
 Yesterday, in the lobby of a Midtown branch of the New York Public Library, three visitors -- a graduate student, a Hong Kong publishing executive and a sixth grader -- stood in various states of awe as a Rube Goldberg contraption produced a book from digital code to hefty paperback in under 15 minutes. 
 The book machine, which occupies the space of two deli-style ice cream freezers, looks like office photocopiers attached to a tinted stereo cabinet and computer terminal. It hums, makes spitting noises, moans and then belches out a newly glued book, fresh as bread and almost as hot.
 The graduate student, Cyrus Luhr, and the executive, Gan Qi, requested a business book, ''The Long Tail,'' by Chris Anderson; the sixth grader, Leysly Avila, wanted ''Moby-Dick'' by Herman Melville, but there was a problem in computer formatting, so she switched to ''A Christmas Carol'' by Charles Dickens.
 The book machine is a demonstration project of On Demand Books, a Manhattan venture founded by Jason Epstein, former editorial director of Random House, and Dane Neller, former chief executive of Dean & DeLuca, the gourmet grocery store. The machine will be at the Science, Industry and Business Library at 188 Madison Avenue until early September, producing free books from a small list.
 There are only three book machines in existence so far, Mr. Neller said. The others are in Washington, at the bookstore of the World Bank, and in Alexandria, Egypt, at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, the modern revival of one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
 Mr. Neller's firm is pitching the book machine, which may eventually sell for $20,000 or more, principally toward the nation's 16,000 public libraries and 25,000 bookstores. A 300-page book costs about $3 to produce with the machine. A bookstore or library could then sell it to customers or library members at cost or at a markup.
 Why bother? The machine, Mr. Neller said, is for the ''far end of the back list,'' those books that are out of print or for which there is so little demand that it would be too costly to print a few hundred copies, let alone one.
 With the machine, Mr. Neller said, anything available in a portable document format, or PDF, including Grandfather's memoirs and Ph.D. dissertations, can be printed in minutes as long as a computer can read it.
 Books that are copyrighted and require royalties would need a negotiated fee before they could be published, he said.
 ''But think what this means,'' Mr. Neller said in an interview yesterday. ''It's not just bookstores and libraries. This is small. It could go into a Kinko's, or a coffee shop, or a hotel or a hospital or a cruise ship.
 ''A rare book available only to scholars, let's say, would now be available to anyone,'' Mr. Neller said. ''Let's say you want a book in Tagalog, a book in French or a book in Spanish. Think of the implications for universal knowledge!''
 In St. Louis, where the book machines are manufactured, Jeff Marsh, the machine's designer, said there was nothing insurmountable in its design or testing.
 ''The big problem,'' Mr. Marsh said, ''was finding capitally sensitive designs'' -- meaning inexpensive -- ''that allow for its use in bookstores.'' 
 The major parts are off-the-shelf office photocopiers and paper-shearing machines, he said.
 A mutual friend introduced Mr. Marsh to Mr. Epstein, the former publishing executive. Mr. Marsh, a former automotive engineer who helped develop automatic braking systems, has no special interest in publishing. ''I just like solving problems,'' he said.
 Gan Qi, an executive with the Chinese University Press of Hong Kong, said she thinks Mr. Marsh's invention will help solve one problem. ''This will keep small publishers from going bankrupt,'' she said.
 Mr. Luhr, a Columbia University graduate student studying education technology, wonders how the machine might affect the future of the bookstore. ''It can't replace it because it can't replace the atmosphere of a bookstore,'' he said.
 As for Leysly Avila, 10, the sixth grader, visiting from Vancouver, she likes the machine because ''you get to see how a book is made.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 2 about the Espresso Book Machine, a device that can produce a paperback from digital code in less than 15 minutes, referred imprecisely to Johannes Gutenberg, the 15th-century German inventor. He invented a method of printing from movable type that sped up book production in Europe considerably, but he did not invent movable type itself. (It originated in Asia centuries earlier.)

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Grows, but Slowly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
While the United States manufacturing sector grew for the sixth consecutive month in July, expansion was the slowest since March, a survey said yesterday, indicating that the economy is plodding along at a tepid pace. 
 The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index, which reflects the opinions of purchasing managers at factories, plants and utilities, registered 53.8 in July, down from 56.0 in June.
 Wall Street expected the manufacturing index to remain unchanged from June, according to the consensus estimate of Wall Street economists polled by Thomson/IFR.
 A reading above 50 indicates growth while a reading below 50 indicates contraction.
 ''Taken with some of the other indicators we saw today, the overall impression is the economy is continuing to muddle along, with growth a little bit below its longer-term average, but it's not veering into the ditch,'' said Douglas Porter, senior economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities of Chicago.
 New orders and production led growth, while inventories continued to contract, as they have for the past year, according to the report.
 Still, both new orders and production were slightly weaker in July than in June. The index for new orders registered 57.5 in July, down from 60.3 the previous month, while the reading for production was 55.6 in July versus 62.9 in June.
 The report showed prices still advancing, with a reading of 65.0 in July compared with 68.0 in June.
 ''Upward pricing pressures now in their seventh month continue to be a major concern for supply managers,'' said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee.
 In other economic news, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday that pending sales of existing homes rose 5 percent in June from a month earlier, the largest monthly gain in more than three years. But the Mortgage Bankers Association said that its index of home loan applications slipped last week for the second straight week.

HEADLINE: A Last-Minute Rally Saves the Day, if Not the Week

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and WAYNE ARNOLD

 BODY:
They bobbed and weaved. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, they surged.
 Stocks closed higher on Wall Street yesterday after a rally in the final minutes of trading that helped the market avoid slipping deeper into the trough it entered last week.
 It has been an up-and-down week, and yesterday was no exception. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index regained some ground after hitting its lowest point in three and a half months on Tuesday, share prices have not recovered from the sell-off last week. 
 Analysts speculated that automatic computer-generated trades might have played a role in the rally late yesterday. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist with Standard & Poor's, said trading programs may have kicked in once it appeared stock prices had stabilized.
 ''That could present a buy opportunity,'' he said, noting that trading programs have also helped accelerate the market's decline recently. ''What the technicals taketh away, they can give back.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 13,362.37 yesterday, up 150.38 points, or 1.1 percent. The S.& P. 500 was up 0.7 percent, at 1,465.81, and the Nasdaq index rose 0.3 percent, to 2,553.87. The Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies, rose 0.23 percent, to 777.92.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell 13/32 in price, to 97 24/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.79 percent, from 4.74 percent.
 Crude oil fell $1.68 a barrel, to $76.53, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The stocks that helped push the market higher yesterday tended to be those with little exposure to the credit market. Fears that the tightening credit market may become even tighter have helped drive the recent drop on Wall Street.
 Technology stocks, including Apple, Cisco Systems and Microsoft, were among the biggest gainers in the S.& P. 500. Telecommunications companies like AT&T also fared well, as did utilities.
 No clear trend was established through much of the day on Wall Street after a sharp fall in overseas stock markets. Concerns surfaced in Asia that investors were being forced to sell Asian assets to cover losses in the United States, and that hard-pressed American homeowners would scale back their demand for Asian exports.
 Asian markets from Tokyo to Sydney fell considerably yesterday.
 European stock markets followed the declines in Asia and closed down about 1.5 to 1.7 percent. 
 Despite a broad consensus that the outlook for Asian economic and corporate profit growth remains bright, global investors have been scaling back their holdings in Asia and other emerging markets recently. 
 Analysts predict that markets there are likely to remain uncertain until a clearer picture emerges of how widespread the fallout will be from problems in the United States mortgage market.
 ''The whole world is depending on investors in U.S. markets to get a little conviction that things are not that bad,'' said Tim Condon, head of financial markets research at ING Financial Markets in Singapore. ''The markets don't care that the rest of the world is booming.''
 Analysts said the reaction in Asia raised important questions about the nature of Asia's economic boom and the composition of its market rallies. 
 The knee-jerk response to signs of weakness in the United States housing market threw into sharper relief a growing debate among economists in Asia over whether the rise of China and India are ending the region's lockstep economic reliance on the United States.
 ''That is the thesis that will be tested in the next year or two, whether a slowdown in the U.S. can be offset by Asian consumer spending,'' said Amar Gill, head of thematic research at CLSA Emerging Markets in Hong Kong.
 A report by the Asian Development Bank earlier this year appeared to throw cold water on hopes that Asia could stop worrying so much about the economic health of the United States and the world's other major regional economies, the European Union and Japan. 
 That report has buttressed economists who argue that rising intra-Asian trade, particularly with China, is largely based on the trade of goods and services that are ultimately destined for American consumers.

HEADLINE: Foreign Automakers Pass Detroit in Monthly Sales

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and NICK BUNKLEY. 
Micheline Maynard reported from Detroit and Nick Bunkley from Phoenix.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Detroit auto companies' grip on the American automobile market ended in July, when dismal auto sales gave foreign nameplates the lead for the first time ever, sales reports showed Wednesday.
 The traditional American brands owned by General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group held 48.1 percent of the market in July, according to the Autodata Corporation, an industry statistics company in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
 That meant foreign auto companies held 51.9 percent of the market. Their previous high was in June, when they held 49.8 percent of automobile sales. 
 In July a year ago, Detroit companies held 52 percent of the American market, according to Autodata.
 ''The world is changing,'' said Ron Pinelli, the president of Autodata. 
 ''We were all brought up with the greatness of General Motors, and that these companies were infallible. Times are different today.''
 Foreign nameplates have led Detroit in sales of cars since November 2000. But Detroit's wide lead in sales of light trucks, like pickups, sport utility vehicles and minivans, kept the American companies ahead in the overall market.
 The popularity of S.U.V.'s began to plummet in 2005, however, after gasoline prices spiked in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. 
 This year, with gasoline above $3 a gallon in many parts of the country, Detroit's big pickup sales have fallen as well, helping the foreign companies squeak ahead in total sales.
 John Casesa, an industry analyst with the Casesa Shapiro Group, said: ''It adds urgency to what is already an extremely fragile situation in Detroit.''
 Foreign brands' control came in a month when even the major Japanese companies, the Toyota Motor Company and the Honda Motor Company, reported small declines in sales.
 But the declines by Detroit companies were even deeper. As a result, the ranking of the companies was G.M, Toyota, Ford, Honda and Chrysler.
 All year, it has seemed likely that foreign auto companies would pass the Detroit companies at some point in monthly sales. For one thing, Detroit automakers have voluntarily cut back on unprofitable sales to rental car agencies; for another, they have kept a lid on incentives like rebates, low-interest loans and discounted leases, hoping to wean consumers from the discounts. That strategy, in fact, helped G.M. and Ford post profits in the second quarter despite losses on their North American operations.
 But the milestone was yet another frustration for an industry that has spent three decades fighting a swelling challenge from Japanese, Korean and European companies, which have built nearly two dozen plants in the United States while Detroit has closed dozens of factories. 
 ''It's probably not that meaningful at all, but it is a psychological blow to domestic automakers' egos,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with Edmunds, a Web site that gives car-buying advice to consumers.
 Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief sales analyst, acknowledged that the industry's struggles were making it more difficult for G.M. to restructure its operations. He said the company would ''accelerate those restructuring efforts where it's appropriate,'' without offering specifics.
 G.M. said its sales fell 19.1 percent on an adjusted basis in July compared with 2006, while Ford said its sales fell 16.7 percent, according to Autodata. 
 Chrysler, which has been enjoying a comeback this year, said its sales fell 4.6 percent. 
 Toyota, which unseated Ford earlier this year to rank as the No. 2 auto company in the United States, said its sales fell 3.5 percent from July 2006, which was a record month for the auto company.
 ''It was a rough month for everybody,'' said Mike Michaels, a spokesman for Toyota.
 Honda also reported a 3.2 percent sales decline, but Nissan said its sales rose 5.9 percent. 
 The figures were adjusted to reflect 24 selling days this year and 25 last year. Unadjusted numbers from the companies showed larger declines in sales, but that did not affect the market share percentages.
 The Ford decline is another setback for the automaker, which is in the midst of a restructuring program called the Way Forward. 
 Although Ford and G.M. are voluntarily cutting back on unprofitable sales to fleet customers, like rental car companies, Ford said its sales to consumers also fell 17 percent in July.
 ''We are encouraged by the progress we have made and consumers' response to our new products,'' said Mark Fields, Ford's president for the Americas region. ''At the same time, we know we have a lot of work to do, and July is a sobering reminder of the economic and competitive challenges we face.''
 George Pipas, Ford's chief sales analyst, played down the significance of foreign auto companies' dominance of July sales, saying that the import brands have dominated the retail sales market since last year. 
 For the year to date, Ford sales are down 13 percent, while G.M.'s are down 9.9 percent. By contrast, Toyota sales are up 5.5 percent for the year.
 Chrysler's decline came despite the wave of new vehicles it has introduced over the last few months. Its sales for the year are down only 2.8 percent from 2006.
 The sales declines are likely to be followed by even more generous rebates and other incentives, which averaged $2,524 a vehicle last month. Mr. Ballew at G.M., which has brought back zero-percent financing plans, said he expected incentives to be higher in the second half of 2007.
 ''We'd prefer not to be pulling incentive levers, but when you've got everyone out there throwing hand grenades at you, at some point you have to respond,'' he said.

HEADLINE: House to Leave Fuel Efficiency Out of Debate on Energy Bill

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives will open debate on a complex package of energy legislation on Friday, but strict new auto mileage standards will not be part of the discussion, Congressional leaders said Wednesday evening. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, decided not to allow a vote on an amendment requiring cars and light trucks sold in the United States to achieve a fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by 2019. The measure, similar to one the Senate passed in June, drew fierce opposition from automakers and dealers, the United Automobile Workers and, crucially, Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Energy Committee.
 A second and much weaker fuel efficiency measure for cars and trucks that was endorsed by the auto industry and Mr. Dingell also will not come to a vote, officials said.
 The larger package of energy provisions, including incentives for production of alternative fuels, new rules for energy efficiency for appliances and buildings, and millions of dollars in new research on renewable sources of power, will be debated beginning Friday. It is expected that an amendment requiring utilities to produce a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable sources like wind or solar power will be offered on the floor.
 Ms. Pelosi made the tactical decision to prevent a vote on the mileage provision, popularly known as CAFE, for corporate average fuel economy, to avoid a nasty fight among fellow Democrats, who are deeply divided over how far to push struggling Detroit automakers to improve the efficiency of their vehicles. 
 But because a nearly identical CAFE amendment passed the Senate, there will be another chance to enact mileage standards when the House and Senate versions are reconciled in conference later this year.
 Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, sponsored the stricter auto mileage amendment and agreed to have it withdrawn after meeting with the speaker late Wednesday afternoon.
 ''This strategy preserves unity in the House and the prospect of a strong 35 m.p.g. standard in conference,'' he said in an interview Wednesday evening. ''I believe we have a majority in the House willing to support my amendment, and I believe it will be part of the legislation that ultimately passes this Congress.''

HEADLINE: Obama Calls for Military Shift in U.S. Focus on Terrorism

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama said Wednesday that the United States should shift its military focus away from the Iraq war to a broader fight against Islamic extremism, vowing to dispatch American forces to eradicate terrorist camps in Pakistan if that nation failed to take such action.
 Mr. Obama, an Illinois Democrat who is seeking his party's presidential nomination, said he would order strikes on Al Qaeda targets and withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid if the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, did not blunt a resurging Taliban presence in the country's tribal areas. This, he said, is the ''right battlefield'' to make the United States safer. 
 ''If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act,'' Mr. Obama said, ''we will.''
 In the second major foreign policy address of his campaign, Mr. Obama outlined a series of proposals to fight global terrorism, including a plan to send at least 7,000 soldiers and special forces troops to Afghanistan, in addition to the roughly 22,000 troops there now. At the same time, he said, he would also increase nonmilitary aid to the country by $1 billion to improve economic opportunities there.
 Mr. Obama is seeking to establish his foreign policy credentials after Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and other rivals have questioned whether he has the military and diplomatic experience to lead the nation in wartime. He delivered a strong rebuke of the administration's Iraq strategy but said the blame went far beyond President Bush.
 ''Congress rubber-stamped the rush to war, giving the president the broad and open-ended authority he uses to this day,'' Mr. Obama said. ''With that vote, Congress became co-author of a catastrophic war. And we went off to fight on the wrong battlefield, with no appreciation of how many enemies we would create and no plan for how to get out.''
 Mr. Obama, who was not in Congress at the time of the war authorization vote in 2002, is working to persuade Democratic voters that he would not hesitate to use military force to protect the United States.
 ''The terrorists are at war with us,'' he said. ''The threat is from violent extremists who are a small minority of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims, but the threat is real.''
 The speech offered a broader glimpse into Mr. Obama's world view. If elected, he said, he would seek out an Islamic audience in the first 100 days of his administration to ''redefine our struggle'' and open ''America Houses'' across the Islamic world to improve a tarnished image of the United States.
 While Mr. Obama often emphasizes his biography -- he is the only candidate who spent part of his childhood living abroad -- he did not dwell on his background during his 35-minute speech, at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He presented himself as a figure who could restore the country's credibility in the world, which he said had eroded since an initial outpouring of good will after terrorists struck on Sept. 11, 2001.
 ''What could have been a call to a generation has become an excuse for unchecked presidential power,'' Mr. Obama said. ''A tragedy that united us was turned into a political wedge issue used to divide us.''
 Mr. Obama has tapped into a broad network of support from the grass roots and the Democratic establishment to raise more money than any other candidate in either party, but he has struggled to compete with Mrs. Clinton in national polls and with former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina in Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest. 
 Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards, as well as others in the Democratic field, have questioned his experience. 
 Last week, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama engaged in a dispute over whether they would agree to meet with hostile rulers without preconditions. Mr. Obama said he would, while Mrs. Clinton said she would not, a distinction that Mr. Obama seized upon again Wednesday in an effort to show that he is a candidate of change.
 ''It's time to turn the page on the diplomacy of tough talk and no action,'' he said. ''It's time to turn the page on Washington's conventional wisdom -- that agreement must be reached before you meet, that talking to other countries is some kind of reward, and that presidents can only meet with people who will tell them what they want to hear.''
 Phil Singer, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said the campaign had no response to Mr. Obama's speech.
 In his address, Mr. Obama also renewed his call to double the amount of foreign aid to $50 billion by 2012 and to provide $2 billion to fight the influence of Islamic religious schools, or madrasas, which he said ''have filled young minds with messages of hate.''
 ''We know we are not who they say we are,'' Mr. Obama said. ''America is at war with terrorists who killed people on our soil. We are not at war with Islam.''

 'THEATER OF CRUELTY' Antonin Artaud (1896-1948) was a Surrealist poet, mystic, drug addict and playwright who is said to have died sitting at the foot of his bed, holding a shoe. Rebellious young writers and artists have long admired him, especially his 1938 manifesto, ''The Theater and Its Double,'' which includes the essay ''The Theater of Cruelty,'' describing performances that try to shock, affect and unsettle the audience as much as they can. At White Box in Chelsea, the curator Raul Zamudio has gathered a marvelously twisted assortment of artwork by two dozen artists from as many nations, all paying homage to Artaud; some of it will no doubt leave you scratching your head in wonder. Video dominates, including Daniel Joseph Martinez's ''Hollow Men'' (video image, above) and Sislej Xhafa's poignant, chilling close-up of a gun on muddy ground being pelted with rain. Something terrible has happened here. 
Marcos Lopez shows small but intriguingly staged photographs of autopsies, with the arrangement of the figures mirroring scenes from Western religious iconographic traditions. Teresa Margolles has a sound installation of a real autopsy guaranteed to give you goose bumps, especially when the pathologist pulls out the power tools. Then there is Martin Durazo's vibrant, chaotic installation in a cubbyholelike crevice in which strobe lights, sound, sculpture and psychedelic video projections, among other things, freely intermingle. The show's wider purpose can be hard to grasp, but the setup gives a clear nod to Artaud. (Through Aug. 11, White Box, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, 212-714-2347, whiteboxny.org.)

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE SHAPES OF SPACE,' through Sept. 5. The Guggenheim takes time off from thematic blockbusters to bring the public up to date on recent acquisitions, provocatively installed by three younger curators among an astute selection of older works from the collection. The theme is space, one of modern art's central concerns. The results are mixed, but cause for optimism. It is not every day you can look at a Mondrian while listening to disco and rap emanating from another kind of grid: the flashing patterns of a digitized dance floor by Piotr Uklanski. The atmosphere can get a bit mall-like at times, but this is what every New York museum needs to do more: play with the collection and find new ways to bring it to life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. 
 (Michael Kimmelman)
 International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cezanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) 
 (Grace Glueck)
 THE MET: 'HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum's collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: ''The question is not what you look at but what you see.'' Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans's late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore's landscapes and Rachel Harrison's photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show -- only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms -- it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Schwendener)
 * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,' through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; John Cederquist's elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) 
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,' through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father (an architect) and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master's from the Maryland Institute College of Art, which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled ''Ripa'' (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine's work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France's difficulties we feel echoes of our own. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org.
 (Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: 'PARADISE IN PRINT,' through Aug. 19. Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed ''green gold'') are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby's 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon's ''Birds of America''; images of African slaves and colonialists; selections from the 19th-century French lithographer Etienne Denisse's book ''Flora of America;'' and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin's extraordinary ''Selectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,'' published around 1780 in Vienna and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the Botanical Garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org. (Schwendener)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,' through Feb. 25. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with ''sacred'' sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole's epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, ''The Course of Empire,'' is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher B. Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro- slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. (See above) (Edward Rothstein)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'SURVEY OF PARIS ABSTRACTIONS,' through Aug. 26. Early in his career, Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) received a Guggenheim Fellowship and went to Paris, where he was introduced to Brancusi a few days after arriving. For five weeks in 1927, Noguchi served as Brancusi's apprentice. Afterward, he set up his own studio in Gentilly, outside of Paris, where he created the 30 gouaches, or opaque watercolors, and six of the sculptures on view here. Brancusi's influence on Noguchi is obvious in works like ''Globular,'' from 1928, an abstract brass sculpture that looks so much like a Brancusi that out of this context it would probably be mistaken for one. But a selection of works from the 1920s to the 1980s shows how the lessons from this period continued to inform Noguchi throughout his career. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. 
 (Schwendener)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS,' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject of ''organizing chaos'' is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
 WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbaran's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the piece de resistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein's brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RESISTANCE IS ... ,' through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it's smart, engaging and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn't look or feel more apposite. (See above.) 
 (Benjamin Genocchio)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (See above.) (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 Galleries: Uptown
 'MAGICAL MEANS: MILTON AVERY AND WATERCOLOR' Milton Avery (1885-1965) painted in watercolor mostly when he was away from his New York studio. Watercolors were light and easy to transport, and during the Depression, when the cost of paper was a consideration, he could use both sides of a sheet. Works spanning more than 30 years are here, including landscapes, portraits, still lifes and abstract compositions. Bulky bathers show him distilling the influence of Matisse and Picasso. Echoes of Ashcan realism are obvious in paintings of train tracks or the boardwalk at Coney Island. Mostly the work shows Avery's consistent desire to, as he once said, ''eliminate and simplify, leaving apparently nothing but color and form.'' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Aug. 10. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'AGITATION AND REPOSE' This group show opens with a very anxious object: a wall clock with spinning hands, by Via Lewandowsky. It continues with Rainer Ganahl's bicycle ride into oncoming traffic and Holly Zausner's body-laden tour of Berlin, and concludes with Claire Watkins's sculpture of what appears to be a detached nervous system. The real draw, though, is a group of six short videos by, and starring, the excellent Roman Signer. In one, a helicoptor buzzes him in bed; in another, hay explodes through the floor as he sits reading; in a third, a sudden explosion prompts him to start -- and finish -- a painting. Repose has never been Mr. Signer's thing. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Aug. 17. (Cotter)
 'COLOUR BEFORE COLOR' The spelling discrepancy in the show's title is meant to indicate that color photography as we now know it was not the exclusive achievement of Americans like William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, but was also nurtured by a group of European photographers whose efforts range from the subtle still lifes of Luigi Ghirri (which are similar to those of Irving Penn) to claustrophobic close-ups of sun bathers by the Spanish photographer Carlos Perez Siquier. The show, organized by the British photographer Martin Parr, is a must-see for anyone interested in the medium. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, hastedhunt.com, through Aug. 17. (Smith)
 'A POINT IN SPACE IS A PLACE FOR AN ARGUMENT' Despite its title, taken from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, this group show of 56 works by 30 artists is fairly even-tempered, less about argument than about unexpected connections. With special attention to the margins and physical process, it ranges across generations, styles and mediums, gathering together works by Lynda Benglis, Bruce Nauman, Niki de Saint Phalle, Forrest Bess, Joe Overstreet, Cathy Wilkes, Raoul De Keyser, Al Taylor and Andre Cadere. Common ground is a shared opposition to tradition, to standard definitions of greatness, to accepted notions of material or finish, or to the separation of art mediums. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through Aug. 10. (Smith)
 'SOURCE CODE' This is the first of three shows commemorating Eyebeam's 10th anniversary. The roster includes ''artists, technologists, hackers and programmers,'' among them Cory Arcangel, Radical Software Group, Mark Napier, Carrie Dashow, Nina Katchadourian, Steve Lambert, Golan Levin and Jennifer and Kevin McCoy. ''The Duellists'' by MediaShed is a work in which two young men, videotaped on closed-circuit television in a shopping center, engage in a choreographed performance of Parkour, a form of ''free running'' that looks like a combination of break dancing, martial arts, acrobatics and skateboarding without the board. Interesting that in an exhibition centered on technology, a work that puts raw human ability in the foreground steals the show. Eyebeam, 540 West 21st Street, (212) 937-6580, eyebeam.org, through Aug. 11. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: Other
 MARTIN CREED: 'FEELINGS' Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of beanbag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an antigravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)
 SOL LEWITT: 'DRAWING SERIES ...' If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)

 MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct,'' and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Genocchio)

 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Monday.(Smith)
 ALEX HAY: 'NEW PAINTINGS' In the 1960s this painter pitted Pop, Photo Realism and abstraction against one another. Now he has turned to ''found'' abstractions: enlarged replications of weathered, peeling boards. Made with an elaborate process of stenciling and spray painting, they lean toward the Modernist monochrome, while keeping one foot planted in trompe l'oeil. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com; closes today. (Smith)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'DATELINE: ISRAEL: NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,' Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though on the whole the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) 
 JIM ISERMANN: 'VINYL SMASH-UP, 1999-2007' This exhibition sets out to be a mini-retrospective of Jim Isermann's vinyl decals. Though the pieces are hung in a manner more appropriate to an interior designer's showroom than to an art gallery, this Electric-Kool-Aid-Acid-Test-colored show will give you a good dose of California-meets-Op-Art aesthetics. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com; closes tomorrow. (Goodbody)
 THE MET: 'POIRET: KING OF FASHION' A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition, the latest effort from the Met's esteemed Costume Institute, does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) 
 'PROMISED LAND' Blink and you could be standing in the American wing of a big survey museum, only Americana here is delivered with a twist: a painting with a hunter standing over a pile of wildlife booty; a pencil drawing of Ben Franklin sitting cross-legged with an eagle above him ready to pounce; a tattered Confederate flag made with bubble gum and hung from a twig. The show, organized by Elizabeth M. Grady, takes its title from John Salvest's illuminated sign with black vinyl letters spelling out the words ''Promised Land.'' Like much of the work here, the sign, bordered with blinking red lights, offers sardonic commentary on the contemporary state of the Union. Morgan Lehman, 317 10th Avenue, at 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-2699, morganlehmangallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)
 'ROLE EXCHANGE' This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, is the practice of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy's fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea (212) 239-1181, skny.com; closes today. (Smith)

 'ARCTIC TALE' (G, 85 minutes) Displaying more corn than is usually found at the North Pole, Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson's global-warming-for-tykes documentary follows a polar bear cub and a walrus pup as they struggle toward adulthood on diminishing quantities of ice. But if you can get past the relentless anthropomorphization and Queen Latifah's cloying narration, the movie's stunning underwater photography effectively dilutes the saccharine tone. 
 (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 
 'BROKEN ENGLISH' (PG-13, 93 minutes) This low-key comedy, about a romance-scarred professional woman named Nora Wilder (Parker Posey) who invigorates her life with help from a handsome, sensitive, fedora-clad Frenchman (Melvil Poupaud), is a textbook example of an Indiewood film: a Hollywood fantasy wrapped in plain brown paper. Written and directed by the first-time feature filmmaker Zoe Cassavetes, daughter of the pioneering independent director John Cassavetes, ''Broken English'' seems blithely unaware of the bait-and-switch that it will ultimately pull. 
 (Matt Zoller Seitz)
 'THE CAMDEN 28' (No rating, 83 minutes) Concise, inventive and unabashedly partisan, this documentary concerns a Camden, N.J., antiwar group's 1971 plot to break into a draft-board office and destroy government records, and the long trial that ensued when the protesters were caught by the F.B.I. The director, Anthony Giacchino, tells the Camden 28's story with energy, imagination and a nearly evangelical belief in their rightness. (Seitz)
 'CAPTIVITY' (R, 98 minutes) This latest example of torture as entertainment uses the abduction and abuse of a vain supermodel (Elisha Cuthbert) to remind us that attractive women need to be kept in their place. Arriving in theaters front-loaded with a controversial billboard campaign (depicting the ''Abduction,'' ''Confinement,'' ''Torture'' and ''Termination'' of its star), as well as a rare censure from the Motion Picture Association of America, the movie has been thoroughly eclipsed by its marketing. Yet despite the controversy, this dreary game of punish-the-tease is no more than a desperate attempt to cling to the buzz of ''Saw'' before fans are distracted by the next shiny power tool. (Catsoulis)
 'THE DEVIL CAME ON HORSEBACK' (No rating, 85 minutes) A brutal, urgent, devastating if formally flawed documentary about Darfur and one man's eyewitness testimony that demands to be seen as soon as possible and by as many viewers as possible. (Dargis) 
 'EVAN ALMIGHTY' (PG, 89 minutes) Your average Sunday school lesson about Noah and the flood is likely to be funnier, smarter and more theologically coherent -- to say nothing of cheaper to produce -- than this drab, timid attempt to wring laughs from religion. (A. O. Scott)
 'FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER' (PG, 95 minutes) The only thing that rises in this stinker are low expectations. (Dargis) 
 '1408' (PG-13, 94 minutes) In this stylish but derivative adaptation of a Stephen King short story, John Cusack plays a writer investigating a series of grisly deaths in Room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan. Mikael Hafstrom directs with old-fashioned restraint and a stylish use of intense close-ups, and while the Dolphin is no Overlook (the hotel in ''The Shining''), its old-world creepiness is exactly right. (Catsoulis)
 'GOYA'S GHOSTS' (R, 113 minutes) This new feature from the director Milos Forman (''Amadeus,''''Man on the Moon'') is an unwieldy mix of political satire and lavish period soap opera. Set in 18th-century Spain and covering the last phase of the Inquisition and Napoleon's occupation, it resembles the Oscar-baiting epics that mix art-house swagger, Hollywood glitz and shout-outs to liberal common wisdom. Stellan Skarsgaard plays Goya, whose narrative presence is more marginal than the title suggests; Javier Bardem is Brother Lorenzo, the monk investigating the disappearance of one of Goya's models, Inez (Natalie Portman), who is being held incommunicado and tortured for the crime of having a Jewish ancestor. (Seitz)
 HAIRSPRAY (PG, 107 minutes) It's no surprise that this musical -- adapted from the Broadway show that was adapted from the John Waters movie -- is good-hearted. It's about fighting prejudice by singing and dancing. The surprise is that it's actually good, including the singing and dancing. (Scott)
 'HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX' (PG-13, 138 minutes) The fifth installment in the series brings the young wizard into political-thriller territory, and also into a struggle with his own anger and isolation. Imelda Staunton joins the impressive roster of great British actors who have taught Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. (Scott)
 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis)
 'I KNOW WHO KILLED ME' (R, 105 minutes) In this inane psychological thriller, Lindsay Lohan plays a serious-minded college student who disappears, only to reappear as a naughty stripper -- minus several peripheral body parts. For Ms. Lohan, it's a long way down from Robert Altman to Chris Sivertson, a director whose creativity is in direct proportion to the number of poles in a particular shot. Nevertheless, this baroque blend of severed limbs and secular stigmata arouses unexpected sympathy for its embattled star. (Catsoulis)
 'I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) ... and completely stupid. (Dargis)
 'IN SEARCH OF MOZART' (No rating, 129 minutes) Made to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth, Phil Grabsky's adamantly linear documentary is a myth-busting stride through a prodigiously talented life. Though occasionally losing itself in reverence toward a slew of musical titans, the movie best serves its prolific subject when attending to the music itself and the breathless enthusiasms of its performers. (Catsoulis)
 'INTERVIEW' (R, 83 minutes) Diverting if dishonest cat and mouse, with Steve Buscemi (who also directed) as a self-serious journalist who says he doesn't really want to interview Sienna Miller's tabloid celebrity. (Dargis) 
 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott)
 'LADY CHATTERLEY' (No rating, 168 minutes, in French) Translating D. H. Lawrence into French, Pascale Ferran has made a bracingly sexy, unfailingly insightful examination of nature, desire and the powerful connection between them. (Scott)
 LIVE-IN MAID (No rating, 83 minutes, in Spanish) This small, perfect film from Argentina follows two women, an upper-class dowager (Norma Aleandro) and her housekeeper (Norma Argentina), whose relationship is altered, for good and for ill, by economic distress. (Scott)
 'MOLIERE' (No rating, 93 minutes, in French) Part of the life of the great 17th-century French playwright, imagined as just like his plays, only not as funny or insightful. (Scott) 
 'MY BEST FRIEND' (PG-13, 95 minutes, in French) This sentimental comic fable about Francois, a middle-aged antiques dealer (Daniel Auteuil) in search of true friendship, is sustained by the director Patrice Leconte's eye for detail and his cast's discipline and intelligence. Dany Boon is Bruno, the gregarious taxi driver and trivia buff who seems to be the man of Francois's dreams. (Scott) 
 'NO END IN SIGHT' (No rating, 102 minutes) This essential, infuriating documentary calmly and thoroughly chronicles the incompetence and arrogance in the early days of the American occupation, which set the stage for what was to follow. (Scott)
 'NO RESERVATIONS' (PG, 105 minutes) If you've seen the ads for ''No Reservations,'' you're probably anticipating a glossy, goofy romance between a tightly-wound head chef named Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her new sous-chef, Nick (Aaron Eckhart). But the movie provides these stock elements and many others, including too-cute therapy scenes, lyrical montages and a wisecracking young girl (Abigail Breslin), playing the heroine's orphaned niece, Zoe. The movie is safe and smooth, but the formation of Kate, Nick and Zoe's makeshift family is observed with empathy and lots of details that ring true. (Seitz)
 'OCEAN'S THIRTEEN' (PG-13, 113 minutes) The gang's all here, looking fighting trim and Hollywood beautiful, at your disposable pleasure. Steven Soderbergh shoots and directs, while George Clooney, Brad Pitt and the rest hustle and flow. (Dargis) 
 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) 
 'OUT OF STATUS' (No rating, 66 minutes) Pia Sawhney and Sanjna N. Singh's no-frills documentary examines the repercussions of 9/11 on our immigration policies and how these have affected America's Muslim community. Filled with moving accounts of detentions and interrogations, fingerprinting and questionable charges, the movie is long on empathy but frustratingly short on specifics. (Catsoulis) 
 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Stephen Holden)
 'RATATOUILLE' (G, 110 minutes) A flawless work of popular art from Brad Bird and Pixar. A portrait of the artist as a young rat with haute cuisine dreams. (Scott) 
 'RESCUE DAWN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) The writer and director Werner Herzog (''Aguirre: The Wrath of God'') has remade his 1997 documentary, ''Little Dieter Needs to Fly,'' as a bruising P.O.W. escape picture. Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler, an assimilated German-American Navy pilot who is shot down over Laos during his first Vietnam War mission, and survives torture and starvation in a prison camp before plotting a daring escape. The movie showcases Mr. Herzog's eye for terrifyingly beautiful landscapes, and a rare understanding of the deep platonic love that blossoms between men in dire circumstances. (Seitz) 
 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 
 'SICKO' (PG-13, 123 minutes) Michael Moore's polemic against American health care -- and, more pointedly, in favor of a state-supported system -- is maddening, moving and funny. An excellent spur to further debate. (Scott)
 'THE SIMPSONS MOVIE' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Cowabunga, dude. (Scott)
 'SUNSHINE' (R, 108 minutes) The end may be nigh in this spooky and spookily beautiful science fiction thriller -- the Sun is dying, as is, alas, poor Earth -- but the director Danny Boyle is having a grand old time. (Dargis)
 'TALK TO ME' (R, 118 minutes) The life of Petey Greene, a real-life Washington radio host, inspired this rousing, raucous movie, which rises above biopic conventions, thanks to two first-rate performances: Don Cheadle as Greene, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Dewey Hughes, the uptight station manager who was Greene's partner and friend. (Scott) 
 'THIS IS ENGLAND' (No rating, 98 minutes) Shane Meadows's modest, near-flawless gem is a humbly, insistently political autobiographical homage to a lost world of youth, around the early 1980s, sparked by heart and a throbbing beat. (Dargis)
 'TRANSFORMERS' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Based on the popular children's toy, Michael Bay's bumper-to-bumper pileup of big cars, big guns and big breasts is part car commercial, part military recruitment ad. (Dargis) 
 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott)
 'WHO'S YOUR CADDY?' (PG-13, 91 minutes) There's probably more wit in the average four-minute OutKast song than there is in the entirety of this comedy starring OutKast's Big Boi. About a rap mogul trying to join a super-elite golf club, the film bills itself as ''the street versus the elite'' but plays more like bad hip-hop behavior versus bad dumb-white-people behavior. (Rachel Saltz)
 'YOU KILL ME' (R, 92 minutes) With its shadows and gallows humor, ''You Kill Me'' goes about as dark as a comedy can go before turning into tragedy or self-parody. John Dahl directs, and Ben Kingsley stars with a bullet. (Dargis)
 Film Series
 STILL LIVES: THE FILMS OF PEDRO COSTA (Tonight through Thursday) Deliberately paced and visually stunning, the work of the Portuguese director Pedro Costa straddles the divide between documentary and fiction. ''Colossal Youth,'' which opens this program at Anthology Film Archives tonight, is Mr. Costa's most recent film. It's the story of a retired worker from the former Portuguese colony Cape Verde who now lives in Lisbon, looking for his place in a neighborhood filled with Cape Verdian immigrants. Mr. Costa's style is invariably described as ''austere,'' a critical term that can usually be translated as ''stupefyingly dull,'' but in this case refers to his gorgeous but carefully controlled effects of color and framing. Five other features by Mr. Costa will be shown in the program, which ends on Thursday: ''The Blood'' (''O Sangue,'' 1989); ''Down to Earth'' (''Casa de Lava,'' 1994); ''Bones'' (''Ossos,'' 1997); ''In Vanda's Room'' (''No Quarto da Vanda,'' 2000); and ''Where Does Your Hidden Smile Lie?'' (''Onde Jaz O Teu Sorriso?,'' 2001). Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives .org; $8. (Dave Kehr)

HEADLINE: For Young Earners in Big City, Gap Shifts in Women's Favor

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Cristina Maldonado contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Young women in New York and several of the nation's other largest cities who work full time have forged ahead of men in wages, according to an analysis of recent census data. 
 The shift has occurred in New York since 2000 and even earlier in Los Angeles, Dallas and a few other cities.
 Economists consider it striking because the wage gap between men and women nationally has narrowed more slowly and has even widened in recent years among one part of that group: college-educated women in their 20s. But in New York, young college-educated women's wages as a percentage of men's rose slightly between 2000 and 2005.
 The analysis was prepared by Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College, who first reported his findings in Gotham Gazette, published online by the Citizens Union Foundation. It shows that women of all educational levels from 21 to 30 living in New York City and working full time made 117 percent of men's wages, and even more in Dallas, 120 percent. Nationwide, that group of women made much less: 89 percent of the average full-time pay for men. 
 Just why young women at all educational levels in New York and other big cities have fared better than their peers elsewhere is a matter of some debate. But a major reason, experts say, is that women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. 
 In 2005, 53 percent of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38 percent of men of that age. And many of those women are not marrying right after college, leaving them freer to focus on building careers, experts said. 
 ''Citified college-women are more likely to be nonmarried and childless, compared with their suburban sisters, so they can and do devote themselves to their careers,'' said Andrew Hacker, a Queens College sociologist and the author of ''Mismatch: The Growing Gulf Between Men and Women.''
 Kelly Kraft, 25, is one of those women. A native of Indiana, she came to New York after graduating from the University of Dayton, got a job in publishing and now works for an advertising agency. ''I just felt New York had a lot more exciting opportunities in different industries than Indianapolis,'' she said. 
 ''In women's-studies courses you always heard that men were making more money, and it was a disadvantage being a woman,'' Ms. Kraft said. ''It's great that it's starting to turn around.''
 New York may also be more attractive to college-educated women, some experts said, because many jobs in the city pay higher salaries than similar ones elsewhere in the country. ''New York is an achievement-based city, and achievement here is based on how well you use your brain, not what you do with your back,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University.
 In 1970, all New York women in their 20s made $7,000 less than men, on average, adjusted for inflation. By 2000, they were about even. In 2005, according to an analysis of the latest census results they were making about $5,000 more: a median wage of $35,653, or 117 percent of the $30,560 reported by men in that age group.
 Women in their 20s also make more than men in Chicago, Boston, Minneapolis and a few other big cities. But only in Dallas do young women's wages surpass men's by a larger amount than in New York. In Dallas, women make 120 percent of what men do, although their median wage there, $25,467, was much lower than that of women in New York.
 Nationally, women in their 20s made a median income of $25,467, compared with $28,523 for men.
 Diana Rhoten, a program director at the Social Science Research Council in New York, said well-educated women were migrating to urban centers where there are diverse professional opportunities and less gender discrimination than in smaller cities and suburbs. There may also be nonworkplace factors at play, she said. 
 ''Previously, female migration patterns were determined primarily by their husband's educational levels or employment needs, even if both were college-educated,'' she said. ''Today, highly qualified women are moving for their own professional opportunities and personal interests. It's no longer an era of power couple migration to, but one of power couple formation in places like New York.'' 
 Dr. Beveridge, based his findings of young women's earning power on data from the census bureau's 2005 American Community Survey used to analyze people working at least 35 hours a week 40 or more weeks a year. 
 It is not clear whether this is the front edge of a trend in which women will gradually move ahead of men in all age groups. Typically, women have fallen further behind men in earnings as they get older. That is because some women stop working altogether, work only part time or encounter a glass ceiling in promotions and raises. 
 But as women enrolled in college and graduate school continue to outnumber men, gender wage gaps among older workers may narrow, too, experts said. Even among New Yorkers in their 30s, women now make as much as men.
 In New York, the pay gap between men and women varied by borough, profession, race and ethnicity, the analysis found.
 Young women from the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens make more than young men from those boroughs. Young women from Staten Island make the same as men. Among Manhattanites, the median wage for workers in their 20s was $46,859 for men and $45,840 for women.
 The gender wage advantage for women in their 20s was widest among whites with some college education, blacks and Asians with advanced degrees and Hispanic women who were high school or college graduates.
 Young men in the city still make more than young women in a number of jobs, including psychologist, registered nurse, high school teacher, bank teller and bartender. In high-paying Wall Street jobs, men heavily outnumber women, which is one reason that Martin Kohli, a regional economist with the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, described the women's wage gains as ''a surprising finding.''
 But in jobs that were once defined as male preserves -- including police officer and private investigator -- where gender barriers are crumbling, young men and women in New York had the same median wages: a little more than $40,000. And women in their 20s now make more than men in a wide variety of other jobs: as doctors, personnel managers, architects, economists, lawyers, stock clerks, customer service representatives, editors and reporters. 
 Melissa J. Manfro, a 24-year-old lawyer who was raised in upstate New York, offered her own theory on why younger female lawyers are outearning their male peers: a desire to begin their careers earlier to prepare for starting families. 
 ''It seems that women tend to take less time off between college and law school, and therefore become more senior, and, hence, make more money, at a younger age,'' she said. ''I would, of course, like to think that means that women know what they want sooner than men. But it probably has more to do with the unfortunate fact that women need to keep in mind biological time constraints and feel a great deal of pressure to build an entire career before refocusing on marriage and children.''
 Though Dr. Beveridge's analysis showed women making strides, it also showed that men were in some ways moving backward. Among all men -- including those with college degrees -- real wages, adjusted for inflation, have declined since 1970. And among full-time workers with advanced degrees, wages for men increased only marginally even as they soared for women. Nationally, men's wages in general declined while women's remained the same. 
 Several experts also said that rising income for women might affect marriage rates if women expect their mates to have at least equivalent salaries and education. 
 ''When New York college women say there are few eligible men around, they're right if they mean they'll only settle for someone with an education akin to their own,'' Professor Hacker said.

HEADLINE: Bush Sends Warning Meant for Syria: Don't Meddle in Lebanon

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush said Thursday that the United States would freeze the property and assets of anyone trying to undermine Lebanon's democratically elected government -- a move intended as a sharp warning to Syria and its ally Hezbollah.
 The announcement, in an executive order and an accompanying letter to Congress, reflects heightened concern in Washington that Syria is trying to reassert control over Lebanon. It comes a little more than a month after the administration announced that it was enacting a travel ban, barring ''those who have contributed to the breakdown of the rule of law in Lebanon,'' possibly including leading Syrian intelligence officials, from entering the United States. 
 Taken together, the steps are an effort to ratchet up pressure on Syria at a time when the administration contends that it is helping to fuel the insurgency in Iraq, as well as creating instability in Lebanon. Mr. Bush's order deems interference in Lebanon's government to be an ''extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,'' and declares it a ''national emergency.''
 Administration officials say they are especially concerned that the fragile democratic government in Lebanon, headed by Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, could splinter if the Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, who has close ties to Syria, tries to establish an alternate government. That concern has grown in recent months, said an administration official involved in formulating the executive order.
 ''We think measures like this visa ban and the executive order not only allow us to target people who are behind this and complicit in it, but they raise the cost of going along with it,'' said the official, who did not have authorization to speak on the record. ''There are key figures in Lebanon who could go one way or the other, who are sitting on the fence, and this is a way to try to deter them.''
 The White House, which has long regarded Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism, is particularly incensed over Syrian support for Hezbollah, the militant group in Lebanon that waged war against Israel last summer. In the months since, Lebanese cabinet members aligned with Syria have resigned from the government, and the United Nations Security Council has voted to form a special tribunal to try Syrians suspected in the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister.
 Mr. Hariri, who was killed in a car bombing, had opposed Syria's strong political and military presence in Lebanon. Protests after his death led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops, who had been in Lebanon since the 1970s.
 The White House would not identify particular targets of the executive order, but they are likely to include those who were potentially under the travel ban. Among them was Gen. Asef Shawkat, a leading Syrian intelligence official and the brother-in-law of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. General Shawkat has been implicated in the murder of Mr. Hariri.
 Experts say it is unclear what effect, if any, freezing property and assets will have. Jon B. Alterman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington who visited President Assad about a month ago, said Mr. Assad and his associates were deeply concerned that the Siniora government could threaten his own.
 ''They are concerned that a hostile government in Lebanon will be a means to undermine the government of Syria, and they're determined to undermine any government in Lebanon that they see as hostile,'' Mr. Alterman said, adding, ''I don't think economic measures can deter people from what they regard as their strategic goals.''

HEADLINE: Sweeping Energy Measure Will Get Its Day in House

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
This was to have been the year that that Congress finally took meaningful action to address the related problems of energy dependence and global warming. The new Democratic majority vowed to make these issues a top priority, President Bush spoke of ending America's addiction to imported oil and industry groups promised to do their share to build a cleaner and more efficient future.
 All this will come to a test Friday when the House debates a 786-page energy bill that could be a major leap toward the twin goals polls say most Americans have come to embrace: reducing reliance on dirty-burning fossil fuels and slowing global warming. 
 But the House Democratic leadership blinked on the issue of setting tough new automobile and truck mileage rules, deferring the question to a conference committee with the Senate later this year. The fate of a second major provision, requiring most electric utilities to produce 15 percent of their power from renewable sources, remains uncertain.
 The energy bill -- actually an amalgam of bills from a half-dozen House committees -- contains a number of significant provisions on energy efficiency for appliances and buildings, incentives for production of alternative fuels, millions of dollars for new research on capturing carbon emissions from refineries and coal-burning power plants and the repeal of some tax breaks for oil and gas producers.
 But even supporters of those measures say the bill will fall short without a renewable electricity mandate and stringent new mileage standards for cars and trucks, popularly known as CAFE, for corporate average fuel economy.
 ''The energy bill? What energy bill?'' said Dan Becker, director of global warming programs for the Sierra Club and an advocate for more efficient vehicles from Detroit. ''If you add everything else in the bill together, it doesn't equal what you would get from a 35 m.p.g. CAFE standard.''
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a tactical decision Wednesday to put off the mileage debate rather than provoke a fierce fight among Democrats. Dozens of Democrats, led by Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, oppose a strict mileage standard because of the presumed costs to the auto industry.
 But Ms. Pelosi decided to allow debate on the renewable electricity mandate, despite opposition among members from many parts of the country, particularly the Southeast, that lack ready access to wind, solar and hydroelectric power. The sponsors of the amendment, including Representatives Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, and Todd Platts, Republican of Pennsylvania, said they believed they would prevail in a floor vote. 
 The utility industry, which wields considerable power in Washington, vehemently opposes the approach, saying it is too expensive and technologically unrealistic. The industry also says it conflicts with mandates on renewable power in 24 states and the District of Columbia.
 Sponsors of the House bill claim its provisions on energy efficiency in household appliances and government buildings alone will remove more than 8.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2030, an amount equal to the annual emissions of all the cars on the road in the United States today. 
 That is an unverifiable estimate, but even if it is off by a factor of two it represents a significant contribution toward reducing global warming gasses. The bill sets as a goal that the federal government, the largest single consumer of energy in the country, be ''carbon neutral'' by 2050, meaning all federal operations, including the Pentagon, would not produce a net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.
 The bill also provides big subsidies for production of ethanol from corn and other sources and tax incentives for consumers who buy hybrid automobiles and solar roof panels.
 There are dozens of relatively uncontroversial measures in the bill that should ease its passage. That is good, some say, unless it wrongly convinces people that the country has met all its energy and global warming challenges and that more painful steps are not necessary. 
 ''The rest of the bill provides some of the building blocks for a transformation in our energy policy, but without a renewable electricity mandate and CAFE, we will not have that transformation,'' said Tim Profeta, director of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University and a former senior Senate aide. ''What is needed are actual changes in behavior, changes in technology and changes in the approach to how we generate our energy.''
 Jason S. Grumet, executive director of the nonpartisan National Commission on Energy Policy, said it was difficult to get lawmakers to think beyond the next election. ''It's hard to convince an elected official to alienate existing constituencies in order to make the world better in 15 years,'' Mr. Grumet said. ''No matter what Congress does in the next few months, these key problems will get worse before they get better.''
 Some environmentalists say an energy bill without auto efficiency standards or a renewable electricity mandate is worse than no bill at all. They argue that if this Congress cannot stomach the sacrifices that will be required to put the country on an energy diet, it is better to wait for the next Congress and the next president to tackle these issues.
 But others say the current energy bill, even without the two most controversial items, still represents steady progress and can be strengthened in conference. 
 ''I'm acutely aware of how little time we have to pass a piece of legislation,'' said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, a private research group. ''I don't think it's responsible to tell Congress to stop working and wait two years.''

HEADLINE: Bottled Water or Tap? It Matters

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''In Praise of Tap Water'' (editorial, Aug. 1) rightly casts the choice between tap water and bottled water in important environmental concerns.
 We must fight the efforts of corporations to transform into a product what is and should be maintained as a public resource. Watersheds must be protected, and municipal water infrastructures must be kept up.
 I propose a second public health initiative for our mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, to go along with his smoking bans. New York City has the blessing of clean, good-tasting water. 
 Let's get water fountains out on the streets and in the parks of our great pedestrian city -- not a handful, but thousands and thousands. I could imagine a design for fire hydrants to be mixed-use devices.
 Visitors to the city should be going home extolling our municipal munificence, not complaining that a bottle of water in Bryant Park costs $3.
 Tim Philo 
 Brooklyn, Aug. 1, 2007
 To the Editor:
 As any kid knows, water from the drinking fountains in older school buildings tastes yucky, no matter how good the water is from the municipal system. 
 The same goes for public bubblers in parks and on streets, and those fountains suffer the added risk of contamination by previous users. 
 Most parents have had the experience of traipsing to the kitchen to get a drink of water for their child because bathroom water just doesn't taste right. Even in my condo building, I need to let the faucet run a while to flush the stagnant, off-tasting water from the pipes before filling my glass.
 Visitors know that in Manhattan, San Francisco, London and any other major city with good water, it is nearly impossible to find a simple drink of tap water without having to go into a restaurant and order food. 
 The bottled water industry addresses a genuine need that before its rise was satisfied only by the soda and juice companies and their vending machines. Hugh C. Lauer 
 Concord, Mass., Aug. 1, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The extent of the use of bottled water has got to rank as one of the most astonishing mass-market brainwashes ever.
 When you consider the costs -- the high price of a near-free commodity and the impact on the environment -- and the ease with which one can get tap water, this should be one of the easiest addictions to eradicate.
 Now, if only I could get my own family to listen to me ...
 Rajeev Krishnamoorthy
 San Jose, Calif., Aug. 1, 2007
 To the Editor:
 An additional reason to encourage drinking tap water, particularly for children and adolescents, is that it contains fluoride. 
 A surgeon general's report in 2000 ranked oral health as a serious health problem in children in America. For low-income families in particular, substituting bottled water without fluoride for tap water in formula feeding or for general use increases the likelihood of dental caries and poor oral health. 
 High-risk children don't need to buy ''status water,'' which will add one more problem to a long list of adverse health outcomes they face.
 John J. Frey III, M.D.
 Madison, Wis., Aug. 1, 2007
 The writer is a professor of family medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.
 To the Editor:
 Your Aug. 1 editorial nicely extols the virtues of America's high-quality tap water and casts a spotlight on the growing economic and environmental costs of our unnecessary bottled water use, including the large amounts of energy required.
 Unfortunately, the problem is even worse than it seems. We estimate that the equivalent of more than 17 million barrels of oil were used to make the billions of plastic bottles Americans consumed in 2006 as bottled water. 
 And that doesn't include the additional energy needed to fill the bottles with water, move them to our stores and homes, chill them for use or dispose of them. Peter Gleick 
 President, Pacific Institute
 Oakland, Calif., Aug. 1, 2007
 To the Editor:
 We should support people drinking water, both tap and bottled, because it's healthier for them and the environment than drinking anything else.
 Obesity and related illnesses are soaring. There has been a 370 percent increase in overweight schoolchildren in the last 30 years. More than 20 percent of the calories Americans consume come from beverages.
 People want and need bottled water when tap water is not available or not preferred. Seventy-five percent of bottled water drinkers also drink tap. If they don't have bottled water, our research shows that half would drink sweetened beverages.
 Our bottles use a third less plastic than other beverage containers. At the same time, it is imperative that we all strive to recycle bottles and other packaging. While water bottles alone make up less than 1 percent of the waste stream, at Nestle Waters, we support improving our recycling laws. Kim Jeffery 
 President and Chief Executive
 Nestle Waters North America
 Greenwich, Conn., Aug. 1, 2007
 To the Editor:
 I agree that the water supplies in most cites are very clean and safe to drink. But there is an unfortunate part of the equation, the delivery system of that clean water. By the time the water gets into our glass, it can go through some pretty unsavory pipes.
 If we could afford to replace those rusty old iron pipes, or convince our landlords to replace them, maybe more of us would drink from the tap.
 Jeff Holtzman 
 Seattle, Aug. 1, 2007
 To the Editor:
 I made the switch a year ago out of bottled water. It was mostly a psychological hurdle, not a taste issue.
 Hint: add a couple of cubes of ice to your tap water and the psychology works in your favor. In a blind taste test, tap water with ice cubes beats bottled water with no cubes every time. Gordon Baird 
 Gloucester, Mass., Aug. 1, 2007

HEADLINE: Growing Pains for a Yearly Tribute to Classic American Cars

BYLINE: By MARY M. CHAPMAN

DATELINE: ROYAL OAK, Mich., Aug. 1 

 BODY:
It used to be that the string of suburbs north of Detroit turned the third Saturday of August -- and just the third Saturday -- into a gas-fired playground for classic car lovers. 
 Then, the one-day ''Dream Cruise'' for car collectors evolved into a weeklong combination of cruise, car show and marketing extravaganza, with car company displays cheek by jowl with classic cars on parking lots bordering Woodward Avenue. And this year, some car owners were already hitting Woodward a month before the official cruise.
 It all may be too much of a good thing. 
 Some car owners, complaining of the crowds and commercialization, are staying away from the main event, while local business owners are divided. Some police departments consider the early arrivals a headache.
 ''The Dream Cruise is supposed to be a one-day event; we kind of accept it as a weeklong event. We don't want it to be a summerlong event, though,'' said Corrigan O'Donohue, a lieutenant with the Royal Oak Police Department. 
 At least one million visitors line the sidewalks to watch 40,000 classic cars snake down a 16-mile, nine-city stretch of Woodward on the day of the event -- it is Aug. 18 this year. Organizers say it benefits 100 charities and contributes $125 million to the local economy.
 But Josiah Sancho, an assembly line worker at American Axle who was out on Woodward one night recently in his 1965 Ford Galaxie, said he was fearful of a breakdown or damage to his car and would probably not drive in the main event. 
 ''Really, it's just way too crowded the day of the cruise,'' he said. Rather than fight the traffic, Mr. Sancho, of Royal Oak, plans to drive his silver car to Woodward Avenue, and then park it. 
 This year, the Royal Oak police have asked business owners along the route to ban early cruisers from assembling in their lots. Officers are also going after cruisers who slow down traffic on Woodward, a six-lane avenue with a divider down the middle. 
 ''The Dream Cruise itself is a family-oriented, fun event, so we want to make sure that event stays safe,'' said Steve Schettenhelm, a commander with the Birmingham, Mich., Police Department.
 Early cruisers say they recognize the need to go after violators, but they believe officers should be more understanding. In Royal Oak, tickets for unsafe starts, also known as peel-outs, run $115.
 ''Mostly, we're just a bunch of 50-year-old kids not out to start trouble,'' said Dana DeCoster, publisher of Cruis'news Magazine, a publication that covers the classic car and hot rod industry.
 Nonetheless, on a recent night, Michael Smith, a sergeant in Royal Oak, was patrolling Woodward when the sound of screeching tires pierced the humid air. ''Sometimes you hear them before you see them,'' Sergeant Smith said, looking to see where the noise came from. 
 A second squeal at the next green light identified the culprit, an apparently highly tuned Cadillac CTS.
 Its owner, Bonnie Mardigian, 43, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., was out with her husband ''practicing clutch work'' in the 2005 Cadillac she received that day for her birthday. 
 ''Some wives want jewelry, mine wanted horsepower,'' said David Mardigian, who owns a local industrial demolition business. (Sergeant Smith let the Mardigians off with a warning, although he could have ticketed them for careless driving or an unsafe start, he said.)
 The close call did not deter them. The Mardigians own 11 classic cars, and they plan to hold a Dream Cruise party on Woodward this year. 
 ''The heritage here is automotive, period,'' Mr. Mardigian said. ''The cruise shows that to the world.'' 
 But the flood of visitors during the week of the cruise forces scores of businesses along the route to close each year.
 The owner of Italmoda, a high-end furniture store in Royal Oak, said he used to keep his store open during the cruise. No more. ''People were coming in to use the bathroom and were sitting on the furniture, or just coming in out of the heat,'' said the owner, Bill Bahoora. 
 Other businesses look forward to the crowds. ''It's the monetary factor,'' said Bill Lamb, executive chef at Vinsetta's Grill in Royal Oak. ''We do about 60 percent more business that day, so the exposure's great because they come back, too.''
 The crowds are also fine with the car companies, who see the cruise as a major marketing opportunity.
 This year, for example, Chevrolet will use the 30,000-square-foot lot it has rented to promote Chevynation.com, a Web site devoted to the Chevy brand, as well as to show off new products. Ford and Chrysler also have had big displays and events, while foreign car companies tend to stay away or put on smaller parties. 
 ''The Dream Cruise is the place to be for car enthusiasts and for those who want to connect with people who share that same passion,'' said Bridget McCarville, Chevrolet's national sales promotion manager. ''From a marketing perspective, it offers a consumer base that we can reach out to.''
 Others, though, aren't happy about the commercialization of an event that started out merely to raise money for a children's soccer field. Some cruisers long for the relative purity of the original classic-car fest.
 Cecil McKay, who owns a 1950 Dodge Wayfarer, has opted out of this year's event. ''I don't want my classics out in the heat in that kind of environment with wall-to-wall cars,'' said Mr. McKay, a retired golf course salesman from DeWitt, Mich. Mr. McKay said he now prefers smaller events in outlying towns.
 ''It's just too many people selling stuff,'' said Mr. Sancho, the Ford Galaxie owner. ''I wish it was like it used to be.''
 But, like Detroit's unquestioned dominance of the automobile industry, ''those days,'' he said, ''are long gone.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise but Reflect a Stable Economy

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off people signing up for jobless benefits rose modestly last week, although the latest figures suggest employment conditions around the country remain good. 
 The Labor Department reported Thursday that new applications filed for unemployment insurance rose by a seasonally adjusted 4,000, to 307,000, for the week ending July 28. Economists were forecasting that claims would rise to 310,000.
 The four-week moving average of new claims, which smoothes out week-to-week fluctuations, fell last week by 3,500 to 305,500. 
 That was the lowest level since late May.
 In another report, demand for products from United States factories improved in June -- but not as much as some had hoped. The Commerce Department said new orders rose 0.6 percent, compared with a 0.5 percent drop in May. Economists, however, had expected a 1 percent gain.
 For the national economy, the latest batch of reports suggests ''it is sort of steady as she goes despite this financial market hoo-ha,'' said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services.
 A more forward-looking report released by the Institute for Supply Management showed that the manufacturing sector lost a bit of momentum in July, growing at its slowest pace in four months. 
 The report is consistent with analysts' forecasts that the economy will grow gradually through the rest of this year.

HEADLINE: Gates Offers Blunt Review Of Iraq Strategy's Progress

BYLINE: By DAVID S. CLOUD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday that he was discouraged by the resignation of the Sunnis from Iraq's cabinet and that the Bush administration might have misjudged the difficulty of achieving reconciliation between Iraq's sectarian factions.
 In one of his bluntest assessments of the progress of the administration's Iraq strategy, Mr. Gates said, ''I think the developments on the political side are somewhat discouraging at the national level.'' He said that despite the Sunni withdrawal, ''my hope is that it can all be patched back together.'' 
 Mr. Gates made the remarks to reporters traveling on his plane while returning to Washington after a trip to the Middle East that included stops in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates but did not include a visit to Iraq. 
 Mr. Gates gave little indication whether he was leaning toward recommending a shift in the administration's strategy next month, when officials are planning to review whether progress has been achieved by sending nearly 30,000 additional American troops to Iraq.
 He acknowledged that when the Bush administration decided to send the additional troops, ''We probably all underestimated the depth of the mistrust and how difficult it would be for these guys to come together on legislation, which, let's face it, is not some kind of secondary issue.''
 He was referring to the failure of Iraq's Parliament to pass legislation distributing oil revenue, setting a timetable for provincial elections and easing employment restrictions on former Baath Party members -- measures that the Bush administration considers crucial for reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites.
 While critical of Iraq's government, Mr. Gates said the security situation was ''more encouraging than I would have expected three or four months ago.''
 He cited progress in reducing violence in Anbar Province, formerly a center of anti-American hostility, and at persuading mostly Sunni tribal sheiks in some areas of the country to cooperate in security operations against Sunni insurgents -- a development he called ''in some respects unexpected.''
 He said the administration would have to balance the relative lack of political progress with the somewhat encouraging security trends when it makes the September review, which will include reports from Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker.
 Several American military commanders in Iraq have said that the additional troops will be needed in Iraq into next year. Some critics of the Iraq policy, including several Democrats running for president, have called for troop withdrawals and shifting to a strategy that focuses on counterterrorism, instead of on protecting Iraqis.
 In justifying the need for a temporary increase in troop levels earlier this year, administration officials said more forces devoted to protecting Iraqis would give Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's government ''breathing room'' to achieve the political reconciliation and progress on legislation.
 But Mr. Gates offered a slightly different formulation on Thursday, arguing that political progress would come when Iraqi Army and police units proved able to take over primary responsibility for maintaining security in areas now largely controlled by American troops.
 ''I think the key is, not only establishing the security, but being able to hold on to those areas and for Iraqi Army and police to be able to provide the continuity of security over time,'' he said. ''It's under that umbrella I think progress will be made at the national level.'' Mr. Gates would not give a timetable.
 As he has traveled around the Middle East this week, Mr. Gates has stressed that whenever the United States begins reducing troops in Iraq, it must be careful not to leave the country in chaos, which he warned could spread throughout the region.
 Completing a four-day visit through the Middle East, Mr. Gates stopped briefly in Abu Dhabi on Thursday for talks with Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates. On Wednesday, he took a helicopter tour of the port in Kuwait that would be vital for removing military equipment when a withdrawal does begin in Iraq.
 Earlier, he stopped in Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
 In addition to asking for help from Arab allies in stabilizing Iraq, Mr. Gates asked officials to toughen their enforcement of United Nations sanctions against Iran and discussed arms sales with each of the countries, part of an estimated $20 billion the United States wants to provide to Persian Gulf countries.
 A senior Defense Department official said Mr. Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who joined him in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, stressed what they called the need for Arab governments to support the administration's effort to isolate Iran, diplomatically and economically.
 ''There's not really room for bystanders here,'' Mr. Gates said.
 Iraqi Boy Loses 5 Brothers
 BAGHDAD, Aug. 2 -- A weeping boy was found Thursday next to the bodies of his five brothers after they were kidnapped and killed by insurgents near Kirkuk, the police said.
 The boy's brothers, all adults, appeared to have been ambushed as they were on their way to paint a police station in Rashad, near Kirkuk, the oil-rich northern city where there have been tensions between Kurds, Turkmens and Sunni Arabs.
 The boy, who was unharmed, was apparently brought along to help his brothers, Brig. Gen. Sarhat Qadir said. Many Iraqis who work with the Americans or the Iraqi government's security forces are sought out by extremists, who accuse them of being collaborators.
 Large areas in the western parts of Baghdad were without running water on Thursday, in 120-degree summer heat. Officials blamed their inability to keep the water-purification and pumping stations going for the electricity shortages.
 Many Baghdad residents complain that they have water for only a few hours a day, and sometimes no electricity at all.

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Signals Rate Rise in September

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank signaled Thursday that it would raise interest rates in September to curb inflation amid an expanding economy. Its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, also vowed to pay ''great attention'' to volatile developments in global financial markets. 
 Mr. Trichet, who does not usually speak to the news media in August, made an appearance after the bank voted Thursday to keep borrowing costs unchanged. He said the bank would exercise ''strong vigilance'' to ensure that higher inflation does not appear. The Bank of England also left its benchmark rate unchanged Thursday, at 5.75 percent.
 Mr. Trichet's use of that phrase suggested the bank's benchmark interest rate would rise a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.25 percent, at the next policy meeting, in September -- the ninth increase since the end of 2005.
 Inflation is now running slightly lower than the bank's target of below, but close to, 2 percent.
 ''That they are willing to preannounce a rate increase means they are very confident of the fundamentals,'' said Erik Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs in London. ''They could have gotten out of it if they wanted to, but the market reaction showed they do not need to.''
 Mr. Trichet also struck a sanguine note about recent financial market turbulence, repeatedly calling it the ''normalization'' of risk assessments by investors who had ignored the dangers in some types of investments.
 Stock markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have been shaken this week by fears of a global spread of financial problems tied to the floundering subprime lending market in the United States.
 Mr. Trichet said, however, that the bank is monitoring market turmoil as it makes decisions. ''We will continue to observe and have great attention for the developments in the market in the period to come,'' he said at a news conference.
 Mr. Trichet said inflation risks had increased as factory output has neared capacity -- which can create supply bottlenecks and lead companies to raise prices amid strong demand -- and oil prices have fallen only slightly from their highs of $78 a barrel.
 The European Central Bank has previously called on investors to price risks sensibly, and Mr. Trichet revealed some anxiety that the current market convulsions were not what the bank had envisioned.
 ''We were calling for an orderly and smooth reappreciation of risks, and we asked markets and investors to be as keen as possible to avoid sharp and abrupt corrections,'' Mr. Trichet said. He urged investors to ''keep one's sang-froid.''
 Mr. Trichet, echoing comments made this week by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the World Bank president, Robert B. Zoellick, said most economies were still expanding, and the best that central banks could do is to keep inflation low.
 ''All we do is pave the way for economic growth to be as sustainable as everyone hopes,'' Mr. Trichet said.
 He also noted that unemployment in the 13-nation euro zone was now at a 26-year low.
 Most investors expect the central bank to raise rates once more after a probable September increase, to 4.5 percent.

HEADLINE: A Tide of Wine May Drive European Growers From a Way of Life

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

DATELINE: PERPIGNAN, France 

 BODY:
A few months ago Isidore Santamaria went out into his picturesque vineyard in southwestern France and ripped row upon row of neatly cultivated vines out of the ground.
 ''It's the worst thing for someone who has planted vines, tended them, watered them, watched them grow and looked after them,'' he said of the farmland, some of which has been in his family for four generations.
 ''It's almost like losing a child.''
 Now Mr. Santamaria is contemplating something worse: uprooting his entire holding of 30 hectares, or 75 acres, within sight of France's mountainous border with Spain. 
 Confronted by plummeting prices due to overproduction and competition from well-marketed and moderately priced New World wines, the European Union wants farmers to destroy 200,000 hectares of vines, out of a total of 3.6 million hectares across Europe.
 The idea is to reduce the supply of locally produced, low-quality table wine, and in that way drain Europe's ''wine lake'' of surplus stock before subsidies are slashed and the industry is exposed to the chill winds of a free, or at least a freer, market.
 The European Union aims to equip its winegrowers, mainly in France, Italy and Spain, to compete with rivals from Australia, the United States and Latin America. But to many small growers and their allies, it is nothing short of a declaration of war, a vivid example of the worst fears of globalization.
 The French agriculture minister, Michel Barnier, has described parts of the proposal as ''madness'' and promises to oppose it. Protests have arisen, ranging from marches and demonstrations to unspecific but ominous threats from a group of militants to take further action if the price of wine does not rise.
 The threat, made by men wearing balaclavas over their faces and broadcast on television news in July, came from a group that has a history of planting small bombs at public buildings and at one winery.
 Mr. Santamaria's plight illustrates why feelings are running so high. The European Commission, the European Union's executive body, estimates wine prices fell by more than a quarter from 2004 to 2006. Mr. Santamaria believes this drop, as well as a reduction in the amount he produces, has cut his income in half, forcing him to tend the land as an act of charity.
 ''It's a catastrophe,'' he said. ''Show me an industry -- say, a carmaker -- where the revenue has been cut in half. What happens? It's the end.''
 ''I work and I manage to pay the bills, but nothing more. For a year and a half I have worked for nothing. My wife works as a teacher -- that's how I eat.''
 The commission predicts that without action, things will become worse: its economic study argues that without change, agricultural revenues in Languedoc-Roussillon, one of the world's largest wine-producing regions, could fall by 38 percent in two years. Other regions being affected are Abruzzo in Italy and Castilla-La Mancha in Spain, both big producers of table wine.
 The wine surplus for the entire European Union could hit 24.8 million hectoliters, or 655 million gallons -- 13.9 percent of total production -- by 2011-2012 (the market year for wine runs September to September).
 The commission wants to spend more than 1 billion euros, or $1.4 billion, from 2008 to 2013 essentially paying farmers to get out of winemaking. Under plans being discussed, the farmers might be eligible for agricultural subsidies for tending their land, but the European Union would end its current financial support for distillation. This pays farmers to rid themselves of excess production by turning it into alcohol either for spirits or, when prices hit rock bottom, for industrial use.
 Then, beginning in 2014, the European Union would sweep away the current controls on how many vines can be planted. In theory, this would allow the market to take over: successful vintners would plant more and operations of greater scale would develop, allowing European winemakers to compete on price with their overseas rivals.
 The European Union says that the changes would also help it at the World Trade Organization, where its wine subsidies are under attack.
 But in France, Europe's most fervent defender of agricultural handouts and a country where wine is seen as a part of national identity, the notion of ripping up vines, abandoning traditional holdings and producing ''industrial'' wine is sacrilegious. Critics of the plan, from farmers to politicians, fear that France will reduce its output, only to find that other nations fail to follow suit.
 They also note that the rocky, arid land in winegrowing regions provides farmers with few alternatives to wine production, and that the demise of vineyards could devastate the economy, killing off whole communities.
 Surveying a field where farmers are actually planting rather than ripping up vines, Roger Torreilles, president of the wine producer Cave des Vignerons in Baixas, near Perpignan, said that they had no other option but to grow vines. He believes the sector deserves special treatment and calls for a bigger European budget for promotion.
 The laws of capitalism are, he argued, ''not adapted to wine because behind wine there is history and tradition,'' and because vines take years to develop, have a life span of decades and do not provide the quick returns required by the market.
 Mr. Santamaria, 59, shares that sentiment. But with the European Union proposing to pay 7,000 euros per hectare in the first year of its program to grub up vines, he would at least be able to recoup some of the cash he spent on the farm.
 ''I haven't decided,'' he said, touring the vineyard in his battered car and pointing to a barren field that was once covered in rows of vines.
 An 80-minute drive north of Mr. Santamaria's vineyard, near Beziers in Languedoc, lies the small but elegant chateau that is home to Domaine de la Baume, bought in 1990 by the Australian wine producer Hardys, part of Constellation Brands and sold in 2003 to one of France's few large-scale producers of table wine, Les Grands Chais de France.
 To purists in France this is the incarnation of the enemy: industrialized wine production. It was here, in 2005, that the same militant group now threatening action set off a small bomb, blowing off one of the cellar doors.
 La Baume has bypassed some of the French labeling rules that leave consumers baffled, ignoring the bewildering Appellation d'Origine Controlee system, which guarantees the provenance of wines, and markets aggressively to foreign tastes.
 Inside the winery complex, in a large, modern, glass-fronted meeting room overlooking the surrounding vineyard, Frederic Glangetas, director of La Baume, smiles as he utters a sentence many of his countrymen would consider pure heresy: ''The trade in wine is like the trade in Coca-Cola or in washing powder.''

HEADLINE: Florida Counties Try to Contain Phosphate Mines

BYLINE: By ADRIANNE APPEL

DATELINE: PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. 

 BODY:
Arguing that the State Environmental Protection Department is far too lax in regulating open-pit phosphate mines, three Gulf Coast counties are spending millions of dollars in an effort to keep the mines from further expansion in a major watershed. 
 Officials of Charlotte, Lee and Sarasota Counties along with the regional water authority, worry that the mines, in the central region of Florida, will decrease the quantity and quality of water in the Peace River, a major contributor to the counties' water supplies. 
 The counties point to the river's importance to Charlotte Harbor, an estuary fed by the Peace River. 
 ''Our whole local economy is driven by the harbor,'' said Janette Knowlton, a lawyer for Charlotte County. 
 Little known outside Florida, phosphate mining has been a major contributor to the regional economy since the 1930s, accounting for 75 percent of phosphate used in the United States, mostly in fertilizer.
 Two large companies, Mosaic Fertilizer and CF Industry Holdings, operate most of the open pit phosphate mines in Hardee and Polk Counties. At the mines, cranes dig a mixture of phosphate, sand and clay that is generally below 15 to 30 feet of topsoil and sand. The material is dumped into a nearby pit and blasted with high pressure water to create a slurry that is pumped through pipes to a plant for final separation of the phosphate. The leftover clay-water mixture is dumped into other pits that become ponds. Today, the ponds dot the landscape. The sand is used to help fill the pits after mining.
 The mines pump on average more than 100,000 gallons of water a minute, according to the Florida Institute of Phosphate Research, an industry-financed organization.
 The Environmental Protection Department regulates the mines. The counties say that state officials have granted too many mine permits and that many permits do not meet federal standards.
 Mining companies have been allowed to destroy streams and wetlands, according to the counties, and areas they have reclaimed remain damaged and scarred. 
 ''We found out through consultants that none of the permits complied with the environmental regulations on the books,'' the natural resources planner for Charlotte County, Bill Byle, said. ''We thought all these agencies were protecting us.'' 
 A study by the Environmental Protection Department found that the forestland in the Peace River Basin had declined, to 17 percent from 60 percent in 1940. Wetlands declined to 16 percent from 25 percent.
 ''Obviously, something isn't working,'' Ms. Knowlton said. ''The regulations aren't tight enough or something went wrong with the procedures.''
 The three counties and the water authority have spent $12 million and days in court in an effort to block the opening by Mosaic of a 20,675-acre mine near Ona, to impose stricter environmental practices at other sites and to track those seeking permits. 
 ''We want to go into this knowing what we will have when they are all done, a healthy, vibrant estuary and clean drinking-water supply,'' a Charlotte County commissioner, Adam Cummings, said. 
 Officials of the Environmental Protection Department defended their permits and oversight of the phosphate mines. 
 ''Our job to treat everyone fairly,'' Janet G. Llewellyn, director of water resource management, said. ''We're not defending the industry. We're trying to equitably and scientifically apply the rules.'' 
 In June, the department gave Mosaic a permit for the first parcel, 4,178 acres, for the mine near Ona in western Hardee County. The three Gulf Coast counties persuaded the department to require stricter environmental practices like leaving wetlands intact.
 ''We were very careful in Ona to make the company stay out of high quality streams and wetlands,'' the director of the Bureau of Mine Reclamation, Richard W. Cantrell, said. 
 ''If you can mine it, reclaim it and put it back in such a nice form, why is there opposition against it?'' Dee Allen, head of permits and reclamation for Mosaic, asked.
 The counties are appealing the permit on grounds that include the fact the department did not consider its own study of the overall effects of mining and other activities on the Peace River watershed. The department secretary, Michael W. Sole, said through a spokeswoman that the study was not relevant to its decision.

HEADLINE: Unions Seek to Restrain 2 Financial Firms

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to require that the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and the hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group, both planning public stock offerings, be regulated as investment companies.
 The companies would have to publicly disclose information about their finances and would be subject to limits on the amount of debt they could assume if they were regulated by the S.E.C. under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as mutual funds are. 
 The S.E.C. is reviewing the plans for initial public stock offerings by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Och-Ziff, both announced in early July after weeks of drama on Wall Street and in Washington over the $4 billion initial public offering of the private equity firm Blackstone Group. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which is a major shareholder in public companies, had called on the S.E.C., without success, to delay its approval of the Blackstone offering and require it to be regulated as an investment company.
 The Blackstone public offering in mid-June, the largest United States offering for a private equity firm and the biggest offering over all in five years, appeared to open the floodgates for other alternative investment funds to go public.
 In a letter Thursday to the S.E.C., the labor federation said Kravis's planned $1.25 billion offering and Och-Ziff's proposed $2 billion offering raised concern because one of the companies owned by Kravis holds $11.9 billion in mortgage-backed securities, while Och-Ziff's offering would indirectly sell unregulated hedge funds to the public.
 The market for mortgage securities -- home loans that are purchased from lenders and bundled together for sale on Wall Street -- has experienced upheaval in recent months as a result of a surge in defaults among borrowers with weak credit histories.
 The two planned offerings use structures similar to Blackstone's to avoid regulation, Richard L. Trumka, the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., wrote in a letter, adding that the offerings ''clearly fall'' within the Investment Company Act's definition of investment companies.
 ''The trend for private equity and hedge fund managers to go public is a big concern for working Americans,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''Behind these elaborate structures, K.K.R. and Och-Ziff are trying to sell risky investments to the public without fulfilling their legal obligations to protect the interests of people who rely on their investments to retire.''
 An S.E.C. spokesman, John Heine, declined to comment on the letter. Chuck Dohrenwend, a spokesman for New York-based Och-Ziff, declined comment, citing the quiet period preceding public offerings in which companies are prohibited from making public statements related to them. David Lilly, a spokesman in New York for Kravis, had no immediate comment.
 Labor unions have been pushing back against the booming private equity industry, contending that its huge buyout deals hurt workers, cost jobs and widen the country's income inequality. The industry also has come under scrutiny by the Democrat-controlled Congress.
 Private equity firms, which specialize in finding undervalued companies, turning them around and then selling them back to the public, have reaped enormous profits in recent years. Their supporters maintain that they play a uniquely important role in the economy in spurring investment and restructuring.

HEADLINE: Stock Market Cycles

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
SALES of high-end art, jewelry and wine are booming. Stocks, until recently, were hitting new highs, and consumer confidence and spending are solid.
 That could only mean one thing: the stock market bubble is about to burst.
 That is at least one plausible conclusion, James B. Stewart writes in Smart Money. 
 ''Far be it from me to dampen the party, but why do I feel as though I've lived through this before? Maybe it's because I have -- in the late 1980s and then again the late 1990s. Indeed, 2007 feels much the same as 1987 and 1999 did.''
 Mr. Stewart is not saying that a 1987-style stock market crash is on the immediate horizon, and he concedes that ''by many measures, stocks aren't overpriced, even at recent highs.'' For example, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reached its previous high in 2000, shares were trading at nearly 26 times earnings. When it reached a new high in June, shares were trading at less than 16 times earnings.
 ''And yet I have learned over the years that nothing rises forever, and that the longer this goes on, the more severe will be any correction.''
 GIMME SHELTER If you think a stock market correction is imminent, and given yesterday's sell-off, it seems possible, what is the best course of action?
 Karen Hube in Best Life offers six suggestions:
 Raise cash. With some money market funds and one-year C.D.'s paying 5 percent, this is an attractive option. (Mr. Stewart makes the same suggestion.)
 Increase your international holdings. ''Foreign stocks are insulated from the U.S. market -- if U.S. stocks tumble, foreign shares generally decline, too,'' Ms. Hube writes. But international stocks are cheaper than stocks traded in the United States, meaning that there is probably more growth opportunities and ''the falling dollar creates a kind of cushion for U.S. investors in foreign markets.'' 
 Move to blue chips. Well-known stocks like I.B.M., Exxon and Altria are likely to weather the storm better than small companies, Ms. Hube thinks. And the dividends they pay will help mitigate losses. 
 Consider T.I.P.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities offer a guaranteed return above inflation.
 Real estate. Really. With commercial real estate still going strong, investing in real estate investment trusts is still a good choice, Ms. Hube concludes.
 Hedge. Invest some of your money in a mutual fund that goes both long -- bets that the stock market will rise -- and short -- benefits when stocks fall.
 CULTURAL BONDS Increasingly nonprofit cultural institutions are issuing bonds as a way to raise revenue, Entrepreneur writes.
 The good news for investors is that the bonds are tax-exempt and, as Farnoosh Torabi notes, they bring diversity to your portfolio.
 The bad news is that they tend to be riskier than municipal bonds. When a city or state gets into financial trouble, they can always raise taxes. If a museum or other nonprofit runs into difficulty, doubling the admission or ticket price is usually not the answer.
 TWICE AS NICE ''The two-dollar bill is on a roll,'' Readers Digest reports, adding that no one is quite certain what is behind the sudden popularity of the note that is ''historically given as change at racetracks, strip clubs and -- because it bears his face -- Thomas Jefferson's Monticello estate.''
 The Treasury Department produced 122 million of the notes in 2004. Last year it made 230 million.
 Maybe it is a leading inflation indicator.
 FINAL TAKE If you want to make 18 percent a year on your money, here's a sure thing, courtesy of Kiplinger's: Pay off a credit card that has a high interest rate.
 ''Six in 10 of us are guilty of carrying a balance -- many at a rate of 18 percent or higher,'' Jessica L. Anderson writes, noting that if you paid $1,000 toward your outstanding balance, you would save $180 in annual interest.
 That is, indeed, a simple way to make 18 percent on your money. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: A Pakistani Envoy in Britain Defuses Cultural Land Mines

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
London
 HELLO London, this is Pakistan.'' 
 Maleeha Lodhi, a vision in glittery turquoise trousers and long tunic, made the introduction as she serenaded tens of thousands of British Pakistanis stretched across Trafalgar Square. The crowd, all smiles and laughter at the prospect of a Saturday afternoon of the best of Pakistan's pop, roared with approval. They came with gelled hair, spiked hair, long hair, fashionable gear, trendy sunglasses; only a few women wore the hijab to cover their hair as a sign of Muslim identity. 
 As her country hovers on the precipice of chaos, Ms. Lodhi, the high commissioner of Pakistan in Britain, holds down the fort in London, working all the angles to convince the British government and public alike that British Pakistanis are normal people, with aspirations like most Britons, and not, as the British media commonly like to portray them, a pack of terrorists.
 Of Britain's 1.6 million Muslims, Pakistanis make up the largest single bloc, about one million. Three of the four suicide bombers who attacked London's transit system in July 2005 were British Pakistanis, and other British Pakistanis have been convicted in recent terrorism trials. 
 On the counter ledger, 257 British Pakistanis serve as elected councilors and mayors in Britain; many, many more hold positions in big financial institutions, and serve as doctors and academics. Last month, Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed one of the four British Pakistani members of the House of Commons, Shahid Malik, under secretary of state for international development. 
 So there Ms. Lodhi was on the last Saturday in July, a 55-year-old former political science professor, journalist and editor, two-time ambassador to Washington and now Pakistan's highest representative to its former colonial power, boogieing on stage with Abrar-ul-Haq, Pakistan's most popular singer; Amir Khan, a British Pakistani Olympic boxer; and Meera, the sexy star of Pakistan's movie industry.
 The Pakistan Festival, two years in the making -- getting permission from the London authorities for a mega-gathering is not so easy in this age of terrorism -- was the most visible endeavor, so far, in Ms. Lodhi's mission to bridge the social and cultural gap between the stiff-upper-lip British and the community togetherness of the Pakistani immigrants. 
 She is convinced, she says, that cultural understanding, economic support and ushering the British Pakistani community into mainstream British life are more important than tougher law enforcement in the struggle against terrorism in Britain. 
 An outgoing person who thinks little of entertaining 100 people at her Hampstead residence, wine included, Ms. Lodhi says she often tries a test on British officials to illustrate that integration is a two-way street. 
 ''The British have their own test from Norman Tebbit, a Conservative politician,'' Ms. Lodhi said. ''They say to immigrants, are you for the British or the Pakistani cricket team? My test for the British is: When was the last time you invited a Muslim family to dinner?'' 
 The answer from the British is uniform, and unsettling, she said. '' 'It's not that we don't invite Muslims, we don't invite anyone,' '' she said.
 FROM her august address at the high commissioner's office on Lowndes Square in the Knightsbridge section of London, Ms. Lodhi, who is unfailingly attired in elegant renditions of the salwar kameez, the traditional South Asian trousers and tunic, brings a potent mix of talents to the job.
 Foremost, she served as Pakistan's ambassador to Washington during President Clinton's first term (appointed by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto) and again during President Bush's first term (appointed by the current president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf). 
 She was present at the now-famous meeting on Sept. 12, 2001, at the State Department between Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage and Lt. Gen. Mahmood Ahmed, the head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. She had been ambassador for nearly two years, and recalls with slightly more texture than most accounts the ''you are with us or against us'' dictum that Mr. Armitage issued. 
 ''The two of them were very tense,'' Ms. Lodhi said of Mr. Armitage and General Ahmed. ''Armitage started out by saying: 'This is a grave moment. History begins today for the United States. We're asking all our friends -- you're not the only country we're speaking to -- we're asking people whether they're with us or against us.' '' 
 Toward the end of the meeting, General Ahmed asked what Pakistan could do for the United States, an immediate indication of friendship, Ms. Lodhi said. The next day, General Ahmed and Ms. Lodhi were summoned to see the deputy secretary again. They were handed a list of seven points, most of which were a harbinger of the coming war in Afghanistan, and some of which are still hotly debated between Washington and Islamabad in the current crisis.
 THAT Ms. Lodhi presents herself as the paradigm of a modern self-made South Asian woman comes in part from her middle-class family heritage. Unlike Benazir Bhutto, whose roots are in the feudal landed gentry, Ms. Lodhi was the daughter of an oil executive and a journalist. She was sent to a convent run by nuns in Rawalpindi for schooling because that was the best education available, and a tolerant atmosphere prevailed. She learned to read the Koran as a child, but hers was a ''spiritual household,'' she said, rather than a strictly religious one.
 She first came to London in the 1970s to the London School of Economics for her Ph.D. Here she married a Pakistani banker -- a union that ended in divorce five years later -- and gave birth to her son, Faisal, now a successful financier in the city. She returned to Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad to teach, but found her natural niche was in newspapers. ''Compared to teaching, journalism is where the action was,'' she said. 
 Ms. Lodhi was editor of The News, one of the national dailies, when Ms. Bhutto approached her to become ambassador to Washington. She had already returned as a firebrand editor of the paper when General Musharraf, who had just deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup, called on her again. She was hesitant. 
 She thought for five days about representing a military man, and decided in favor. ''He was deeply committed to making Pakistan a more modern society,'' she said. But now, more than seven years later, with many Pakistanis howling for Mr. Musharraf to shed his uniform and even hand over power, she is diplomatic. ''Economically, he's moved,'' she said. ''Politically, obviously more needs to be done.'' 
 She says she has not heard grumbles from the pro-democracy forces about being ambassador for a military regime. ''Envoys serve the country,'' she said. Some people, she suggested, would see her as a useful influence from within. 
 Ms. Lodhi admires the United States. ''I say to the government here: the United States is an amazing example of how to embrace ethnic minorities,'' she said. ''They are not seen as ethnic minorities, they're Americans.'' 
 British officials, she said, perplexed by the emergence of terrorism suspects in the British Pakistani community, often ask her ''how come things are different here.'' First, she said, she reminds them upfront that the United States did not have an empire. ''That plays into how people are perceived when they are nonwhite,'' she said she tells them.
 And she has her own favorite personal comparison. ''When I moved into the neighborhood in Washington, people came up and asked if there was anything I needed,'' she said. Someone delivered a piece of pumpkin pie, someone else flowers. 
 ''I've lived in my neighborhood in London for three and a half years, and I have no idea who the neighbors are.''

HEADLINE: MARKETS TUMBLE AS LENDER WOES KEEP MOUNTING

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Eric Dash and David Leonhardt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled yesterday on fears that the worsening ills in the mortgage and debt markets could soon take a significant toll on consumers, businesses and the overall economy.
 The latest decline capped a volatile two weeks on Wall Street in which the stock market has swung wildly from day to day, reflecting rising uncertainty about the outlook for markets and the risks plaguing the economy. The biggest moves lately have often occurred shortly before trading closed. 
 Indeed, the market dropped particularly sharply yesterday afternoon after investors were rattled by remarks by executives at Bear Stearns, the investment bank that has been heavily involved in mortgage securities. The firm's assurances about its own financial position were overshadowed by bleak comments by its chief financial officer about the credit markets. 
 ''I have been at this for 22 years, and this is about as bad as I have seen it in the fixed-income market,'' said Samuel L. Molinaro Jr., Bear Stearns's chief financial officer.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.7 percent yesterday, with much of the decline coming after Bear's conference call started around 2 p.m. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 281.42 points, or 2.1 percent. And the dollar fell noticeably against the euro and the British pound.
 While consumers continue to express confidence in the outlook for the economy, the government's monthly employment report, released yesterday morning, added to worries about the spreading impact of the housing slump. The economy added only 92,000 jobs last month, down from 126,000 in June and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6 percent. 
 Mortgage companies have significantly tightened credit lately to borrowers with weak credit histories and are even cracking down on those with solid records who are taking on riskier loans.
 On Thursday, the credit worries were so severe that even Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage company, felt compelled to tell investors that it did not face any difficulties raising money.
 Lenders say they are increasingly unable to persuade investors to buy packages of home loans made to borrowers with little or no down payment or those who cannot fully document their incomes. As a result, many companies are no longer offering such loans to potential buyers.
 ''I have never seen it happen so quickly,'' said Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Scottsdale, Ariz. ''Banks always do these little cutbacks here and there. What they are doing now is a liquidity crunch. It's a credit freeze.''
 Richard F. Syron, chief executive of Freddie Mac, the large buyer of mortgages created by Congress in the 1970s, said yesterday that the speed and severity of the tighter credit terms are surprising, but perhaps necessary given the excesses in the market in recent years.
 In a telephone interview from Washington, he was wary of the calls by some mortgage industry officials that Freddie Mac and its cousin, Fannie Mae, step in to buy loans and securities that private investors will no longer purchase. Mr. Syron noted that his company was operating under an agreement with its regulator that limited the size of its portfolio. 
 ''There are some loans that are in difficulty'' because credit pools are drying up, Mr. Syron said. ''There are other loans that probably should never have been made and providing more liquidity will make that situation worse in the long term.''
 The interest rates on many popular mortgages have risen by as much as a full percentage point, if they are available at all, said George J. Jenich, founder of FreeRateSearch.com, a consumer Web site. But rates on conventional fixed-rate 30-year mortgages have held steady.
 Bear Stearns scheduled its conference call to reassure investors after Standard & Poor's, one of the agencies that rates the creditworthiness of companies, said it was considering downgrading Bear's credit rating because of the collapse of two hedge funds it recently put into bankruptcy after they made losing bets on mortgage securities.
 Despite all the worries about credit markets, however, the economy continues to plow ahead and even yesterday's jobs report was not weak enough to suggest that the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark short-term interest rate when it meets next week. 
 But the risks to the economy do seem serious enough that investors now expect the Fed to cut its rate to 5 percent, from 5.25 percent by November, based on the price of a trading instrument that is tied to Fed policy. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.68 percent from 4.77 percent Thursday evening. 
 Wall Street analysts say they are increasingly concerned that consumer spending will weaken as more people in housing and related sectors lose their jobs. They also worry that many homeowners will cut back as they find it harder to refinance or borrow against the value of their homes.
 ''You have a broad sell-off because people don't know how far the subprime cloud is going to hang over U.S. industries,'' said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management, an investment firm based in Tulsa, Okla. ''If they don't get assurance, they are just selling off rather than asking questions.''
 The S.& P. has fallen 7.7 percent, to 1,433.06, since July 19, the day it established a record. The last two weeks were the worst such period in more than four and a half years, and the broad market index is now up just 1 percent for the year. The Dow is doing somewhat better; it has fallen 5.9 percent, to 13,181.91, since July 19, but it is still up 5.8 percent for the year.
 And through it all, businesses have been reporting strong earnings. Profits are up 9.6 percent in total for the 80 percent of the companies in the S.& P. index that have released results for the second quarter, noted Douglas M. Peta, chief market strategist at J. & W. Seligman & Company, an investment firm based in New York.
 Despite that, Mr. Peta said, he was not particularly optimistic about the near-term outlook for stocks and far less so about the market for debt.
 ''It seems to me things got every bit as silly in the credit markets in the last few years as they did in tech stocks in the late 1990s,'' he said. ''I still think we may have a ways to go in this.''

HEADLINE: Jobs Growth Slid in July, Echoing Drift

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Job creation slackened last month, extending a trend of softening employment growth that mirrors the modestly downward path of the economy.
 At the same time, the national unemployment rate edged up, to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent, the government said yesterday in its monthly jobs report.
 Although the labor market is holding up well by most measures -- layoffs are not widespread and wages are rising -- economists said job growth appears likely to continue slowing for the rest of the year. 
 How modest the deceleration in the labor market will be is unclear, but the employment picture will determine how solidly the economy can stand up in the months ahead. 
 The housing market is in an unrelenting state of decline, with uncertainty growing over how much further credit markets will tighten, and the outlook for the economy is becoming cloudier by the day. The unease was echoed yesterday on Wall Street, where stocks suffered some of their sharpest losses of the year.
 ''The labor market as of now is O.K.,'' said Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist with Deutsche Bank. ''But the issue is, will the current rate of job growth sustain income at a fast enough rate to offset the other factors in the economy that don't look so good?'' 
 Wages are still up over the past year. In July, workers in nonmanagement jobs, who make up about four-fifths of the work force, earned an average of $17.45 an hour, the government said. That is 1.4 percent higher, after adjusting for inflation, than the average of $17.20 in July 2006.
 But the average wage peaked at $17.52 in February and has since fallen. In recent months, the growth in nominal wages -- the numbers people see in their paychecks -- has slowed somewhat, while inflation has jumped. That raises the question of whether consumer spending, the engine of the American economy, will remain strong enough to support healthy growth.
 Wage growth in the current economic recovery has been unusually weak. The real average wage for rank-and-file workers actually fell from the start of 2002 to late 2006, despite solid economic growth. As job growth picked up, wages surged in the second half of last year before falling back this year.
 While the economy nearly stalled in the first quarter, advancing just 0.6 percent, consumer spending provided a buffer against a recession. Then, when consumer spending slowed in the second quarter, business spending picked up the slack. But business spending in the second half of the year is not expected to be as strong, so the American consumer's contribution will be vital. 
 Although the July jobs report showed some deterioration in the labor market, it is unlikely to give the Federal Reserve a reason to lower interest rates anytime soon, economists said. Still, Wall Street appeared to think otherwise and, in the market for Fed futures contracts, raised the odds yesterday that a rate cut would happen before the end of the year.
 The White House cast the report in a positive light, calling the data ''good, solid numbers,'' in the words of Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. But his characterization of the report was somewhat tempered. ''The job numbers, although slightly lower than the previous month, are still within range,'' Mr. Lazear told reporters. 
 Over all, the Labor Department found that businesses and governments added 92,000 jobs in July, down from 126,000 in June. That was the slowest pace of job creation since February, when employers hired 90,000.
 The percentage of working-age Americans who were employed, a closely watched measure of the health of the job market, fell in July to 63 percent, from 63.1 percent a month earlier.
 Job creation this year has averaged 136,000 a month, compared with 188,000 a month last year.
 Economists noted that some of the downsizing could have been seasonal. For instance, governments dropped more workers than any other sector as state and local entities cut back education jobs during the summer school break. In all, 28,000 government jobs were lost last month. Construction companies, both residential and commercial, eliminated 12,000 jobs. Retailers cut 1,200 jobs, continuing the pattern of cutbacks in recent months but at a slower pace.
 The job market's strength last month was in the financial, business services, hospitality and health care fields. Banking and insurance businesses added more than 20,000 workers; health care and social assistance jobs grew by 44,000; and restaurants and bars were up by more than 22,000. White House economists and some others pointed to such strong private sector growth as a sign that the job market is stronger than it appears.
 ''There was a 120,000 gain in private employment,'' said Chris Varvares, the president of Macroeconomic Advisers. ''People describe the report as weak, but that's the sweet spot; 120,000 is probably where we ought to be, given the slowdown in the economy.''
 While the economy cooled considerably in the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year, the job market never slowed as much as such weak growth would imply.
 To some economists, that signals a shift in the way businesses have approached hiring recently.
 ''People aren't in as much of a hurry to hire and fire as they used to be,'' said Drew Matus, an economist with Lehman Brothers.
 Other factors could be at work as well, like slowing productivity. 
 Mr. Varvares said: ''The mystery has been that, given the growth slowdown, why didn't we see employment slow down more? And I think we're getting some answers to that: productivity growth was slower.''

 Guatemala's CampaigningIs Bloodiest in its History
 It is election time in Guatemala and that means rallies and banners -- and body bags. In the campaigning leading up to elections on Sept. 9, there have been at least 61 violent attacks on candidates and political activists, according to authorities. The death toll as of mid-July was 26, making this the bloodiest campaign in the country's history. A1
U.S. Strikes at Taliban Leaders 
 The United States military said that it had carried out an airstrike on two Taliban commanders during ''a sizable meeting'' of insurgents in a remote region of Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan, but that it could not be sure the men had been killed. A6 
 Libya Close to 2 Weapons Deals
 European Aeronautic Defense and Space, Europe's largest aerospace company, said that it was close to signing two weapons contracts with the government of Libya. It would be the first arms deal with the North African country since the European Union lifted military sanctions on it nearly three years ago. A2 
 Israel Rethinks Holocaust Fund
 Trying to forestall an embarrassing protest march by survivors of the Holocaust, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel agreed to rethink a widely criticized plan to give each a monthly stipend of about $20. A5 
 Italian Priest Accused of Abuse
 A prominent Italian priest has been accused of sexually abusing drug-addicted young men at one of his charity rehabilitation centers, his spokesman confirmed. He is the founder of Comunita Incontro, which has nearly 200 centers in Italy that care for drug addicts and homeless people. A5 NATIONAL A7-11
 Recovery Efforts ContinueAnd More Bridges Checked
 As recovery divers moved from car to car in the murky waters of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis searching for victims of the I-35W Bridge collapse, state officials across the country raced to inspect bridges that are similar to the steel-deck truss bridge that collapsed, killing at least five people. A1 
 A bitter procedural fight in the House forced Democrats to delay consideration of an energy efficiency bill they had hoped would cap off a week of accomplishment before heading home. But lawmakers put their disagreements aside long enough to approve $250 million to help rebuild the collapsed bridge in Minneapolis. A1 
 Court Rules Against F.B.I.
 An appeals court ruled that the F.B.I. violated the Constitution in the methods used to search through evidence seized in a raid on the offices of Representative William J. Jefferson, a Louisiana Democrat who has been indicted on bribery charges. A7 
 Concerns Over Spy Program
 The Bush administration, pressing for broader wiretap authority, warned Congressional leaders that the secret intelligence court overseeing eavesdropping operations has become overburdened and ''frustrated'' by its oversight of foreign-based communications and had sought help from Congress to ease the load. A8 
 Efforts to Contain Mines

HEADLINE: Toyota Says Quarterly Profit Jumped 32%

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Toyota Motor reported a 32 percent rise in quarterly profit on Friday, continuing a streak of record earnings as the Japanese car company seeks to widen its lead over General Motors as the world's largest automaker.
 Toyota also said Friday that it expected its sales in the all-important North American market to remain as strong as they were last year, despite a sales drop last month and broader concerns of a possible economic slowdown in the United States.
 Toyota said sales were brisk during the April-June quarter in the United States, where high pump prices raised the popularity of high-mileage vehicles like its Prius, a gasoline-electric hybrid, and the RAV4, a small sport utility vehicle. Toyota reported sales gains in every region of the world except its home market of Japan, where the auto market is saturated. 
 Analysts said this showed Toyota could be building a formidable lead in global markets over G.M., which has recently relied on strong overseas sales to offset its weakness in the United States. Toyota is also trying harder to sell cars in newer markets like China and Russia to reduce its current dependence on the United States, the world's largest auto market, analysts said.
 ''Toyota will be No. 1 in sales this year, without a doubt,'' said Shinji Kitayama, a senior analyst at Shinko Securities in Tokyo. ''One of Toyota's strong points is that its cars sell well all over the world.''
 In the first three months of this year, the Toyota Group, which includes the minicar maker Daihatsu and the truck producer Hino Motors, outsold G.M. for the first time in 76 years, by 109,000 vehicles.
 Toyota also said its profit got a boost from a weak Japanese yen, which makes its products cheaper in overseas markets. Detroit automakers have grumbled that the weak currency gives Japanese rivals an unfair advantage. Earlier this week, sales statistics showed that foreign brand autos outsold Detroit automakers in the United States for the first time ever.
 Despite Friday's upbeat earnings, analysts said concerns remained over whether Toyota could maintain its momentum, especially if the yen stopped falling against the dollar. They said another fear was that recent problems with subprime mortgages in the United States might spread into other types of lending, including financing of autos. They said Toyota and other carmakers could face losses if American consumers start defaulting on auto loans.
 There are also concerns that the subprime problems could seep into the overall American economy, causing a slowdown that would hurt auto sales. Such concerns were fed earlier in the week, when automakers including Toyota reported drops in sales during July.
 ''Looking forward, the biggest questions now are what will happen with the subprime finance problems and U.S. sales,'' said Atsushi Kawai, an analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities in Tokyo. ''The American market is the key.''
 On Friday, Toyota tried to allay those concerns. Takeshi Suzuki, a senior managing director, told reporters that American sales were still on an upward trend, despite the July drop. Toyota also continued a meteoric growth streak that has helped make it the world's most profitable automaker.
 On Friday, Toyota said its group net profit for the quarter that ended on June 30 was a record 491.5 billion yen ($4.13 billion). Analysts said the strong results showed Toyota was on track for its eighth consecutive year of record annual earnings. During much of that streak, American automakers have struggled with whopping losses and falling market share.
 Toyota said sales also rose 15.7 percent from the previous year, to 6.52 trillion yen. That was more than G.M.'s best quarterly sales ever.
 Analysts praised Toyota's ability to keep increasing profits even while it invested heavily in new environmentally friendly engine technologies like hybrids and fuel cells, which run on hydrogen. The company has also ridden out recent jumps in the prices of steel, rubber and other materials by squeezing costs from its already lean production, analysts said.
 Toyota said the weak yen bolstered profit in the quarter by 100 billion yen. It kept unchanged its forecast for the full fiscal year, which ends March 2008, at 1.65 trillion yen.
 Toyota said global vehicle sales rose 3.4 percent, to 2.16 million units, in the quarter. The biggest gains came in Asia outside Japan, where sales rose 15 percent, to 222,000 vehicles, Toyota said. In North America, sales were up 2 percent, to 762,000. European sales rose 8.1 percent, to 333,000 vehicles. In Japan, they fell 7.9 percent, to 500,000 vehicles, Toyota said.

HEADLINE: Chavez Takes 'Crazy Battalion' of Supporters on the Road

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: LA FRIA, Venezuela, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Surely they will take photos of us by satellite,'' said President Hugo Chavez, referring to intelligence agencies from the United States, as his Airbus touched down Friday in this Andean city with the actor Sean Penn, a clutch of cabinet ministers and visiting dignitaries from half a dozen countries in tow. 
 ''They'll say, 'There goes Chavez with a crazy battalion containing Africans, Canadians, Cubans,' '' the president continued as he broke into a meandering riff on political relations between the United States and Venezuela. ''Even gringos!'' 
 Mr. Penn's visit to write about Mr. Chavez follows others by Hollywood luminaries like Danny Glover, public intellectuals like Tariq Ali and film directors like Argentina's Fernando Solanas, all of whom have recently traveled to this country to take in the transformation of Venezuelan society that Mr. Chavez calls a ''Bolivarian revolution.'' 
 But rarely has the reception of foreign actors and writers been as warm as it was this week for Mr. Penn, whom Mr. Chavez, perhaps smarting from international condemnation over his government's treatment of critics in the local news media, hailed as ''valiant'' for his outspoken opposition to the war in Iraq and other policies of the Bush administration. 
 After sending Mr. Penn on guided tours of Villa del Cine, the state movie studio near Caracas created to weaken Hollywood's grip on the film industry, and the Afro-Venezuelan city of Barlovento, the president dined privately with the actor on Thursday before whisking him away Friday for a jaunt into western Venezuela. 
 What followed, for a handful of journalists given the rare opportunity of accompanying Mr. Chavez on such a trip, was a glimpse into his government's use of imagery and pomp to court public opinion both at home and abroad. 
 During the flight, Mr. Chavez regaled Mr. Penn with lectures on Venezuelan history and tales of his own past as a soldier, between talking politics with other travelers on the spacious Airbus with leather seats. 
 The border region in Tachira State where the plane landed, Mr. Chavez warned, ''was very close to where the C.I.A. is,'' a not-so-subtle dig at the close political relationship between Colombia's government and the Bush administration. 
 As for the United States, Mr. Chavez predicted that widening budget and trade deficits portend a financial crisis that could cause it to ''explode from within.'' 
 ''There could be a revolution in the United States,'' Mr. Chavez said. ''We'll help them.'' 
 Mr. Penn took in most of Mr. Chavez's comments with a warm smile, some nods and few intelligible utterances. ''He's a quiet man,'' Mr. Chavez reassured other passengers, gesturing to Mr. Penn. ''But he has fire within him.'' 
 Mr. Chavez, it can be guaranteed, likes to be in the driver's seat in such forays -- literally. On the tarmac of the airport in La Fria, he climbed behind the wheel of a Tiuna, a Humvee-esque military vehicle assembled in Venezuela, put Mr. Penn in the back seat and proceeded to drive through picturesque Andean villages. 
 A trip that normally takes 90 minutes to Pueblo Encima, a small farming community where Mr. Chavez was scheduled to celebrate the opening of a fertilizer facility and the arrival of dairy cows from Argentina and Uruguay, took more than four hours as the president stopped the Tiuna dozens of times to greet supporters on the side of the road. 
 A truck carrying journalists traveled in front, lurching ahead as desperate news cameramen and photographers yelled at the driver to start or stop. At times they cheered, as when they got shots of Mr. Penn urinating on the side of the road. 
 Chaperoned by Andres Izarra, the president of Telesur, the regional news network backed by Venezuela's government, Mr. Penn looked somewhat pained when asked about his impressions of the country. 
 In a brief interview at one of the motorcade's many stops, Mr. Penn declined to discuss any similarities that might exist between the president in the driver's seat of the Tiuna and the Southern populist, loosely based on Louisiana governor Huey Long, that Mr. Penn played in the recent film adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's ''All the King's Men.'' 
 Instead, Mr. Penn produced a business card from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, which he said he was representing during his Venezuela trip. 
 ''I'm going to write about this experience, so I'm a little hesitant to talk about it,'' Mr. Penn said, dressed in a T-shirt and wearing dark aviator sunglasses. (Mr. Penn has written similar dispatches following trips to countries like Iran and Iraq.) ''It's been extraordinary so far.'' 
 Then, with the same quiet intensity Mr. Chavez had referred to earlier, the actor proceeded to try to find someone with a match for a Marlboro Light. 
 Undaunted by criticism from some Venezuelan actors and directors who deride the warm ties between some of their foreign counterparts and Mr. Chavez, the president hailed Mr. Penn's presence at each stop of the trip.
 At a speech in Pueblo Encima, before hundreds of followers clad, like Mr. Chavez and much of his entourage, in the red of his political party, a cold mountain rain caused the entourage from tropical Caracas to shiver as Mr. Chavez broke into song in praise of dairy cows. 
 He celebrated Venezuela's alliance with Cuba in the presence of Ricardo Alarcon, the president of Cuba's National Assembly. He welcomed dignitaries from Burkina Faso, Canada and Belgium who spoke in favor of his policies. 
 And with the acumen of a politician who knows how to celebrate friends where he can find them, Mr. Chavez switched into English with a few words for Mr. Penn: ''Thank you, thank you, thank you.''

HEADLINE: Bulging Profits in U.S. Often Originate Overseas

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
AMERICAN companies have been very profitable in recent years -- but not necessarily because of the American economy. 
 Government estimates indicate that profits of companies operating in the United States -- whether American or foreign -- have risen at an average annual rate of 7 percent in the current decade. 
 That is not bad, and in fact is slightly higher than the gains of the 1980s or 1990s, as shown in the accompanying charts. The figure is lower than the 7.5 percent rate of the 1970s, but it is worth remembering that these figures are not adjusted for inflation, which was higher then.
 But government figures also indicate that the profits of American companies from their overseas operations have been growing at a much faster pace of 13.7 percent in the current decade, nearly twice the rate in this country.
 To some extent, such figures may be questioned because some companies arrange their operations to maximize profits in low-tax jurisdictions. But they also reflect the strength of the economy in much of the world, particularly Asia.
 In recent years, there have been frequent comparisons of overall profits of American companies with the wages of American workers -- and the profits have appeared to be doing much better. But the figures are distorted by inclusion of the overseas profits, and thus may overstate the differential.
 One chart with this article shows domestic profits -- the profits made by companies in America, regardless of where the company is based -- as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product. Next to it is a chart showing the percentage of G.D.P. that goes to wages and salaries of workers in private industry.
 At its recent peak in the third quarter of 2006, the share going to profits was 10.1 percent, the highest since 1968 but well below the peak of 11.7 percent reached in 1966. In the first quarter of this year, the latest figure available, the figure was down to 9.2 percent, which may reflect the slowing of the American economy.
 The share going to workers -- based on figures that include neither benefits nor the employer's Social Security contributions -- hit a 10-year low of 34.2 percent in the second quarter of last year, but has since edged back above 35 percent in the first two quarters of this year. Business seems to have weakened, but so far few companies have cut back on employment.
 Another chart shows the percentage of profits of companies based in the United States that came from other countries. In the 1960s, when the American economy was much less open to the world, about 7 percent of profits came from overseas. By this year's first quarter, that share was up to 29 percent.
 The figures that have really soared to unprecedented heights are the ones that may be most important to investors -- the cash sent out to them by companies. The government reports that in the first quarter of 2007, dividends and share buybacks equaled 5.1 percent of G.D.P., twice the proportion during the late 1980s.
 The figure is still below the 5.4 percent recorded in the last quarter of 2004, but that number was an aberration caused by Microsoft's payment of an extraordinary dividend of $32 billion. 

GRAPHIC: Charts: Corporate profits from American operations are still well below where they were in the 1960s, when viewed as a percentage of G.D.P. But the dividends paid to company owners are in record territory. And the share going to employees has risen slightly after approaching lows set in the early 1990s. Charts show 3 different line graphs: Corporate profits from U.S. operations, Private sector wage and salary income, Corporate dividends, including share buybacks
 American companies are earning more and more of their money overseas -- 29 percent in the first quarter of this year, or more than four times the share in 1960. Those foreign profits have risen more rapidly than domestic ones in every decade except the 1980s. Second set of charts shows two line graphs: Share of profits of United States corporations from foreign operations, Annual profit increases by decade (Source: U.S. Treasury, via Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: Workers Say They Feel Blindsided by Lender's Failure

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

DATELINE: MELVILLE, N.Y., Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Among the 1,400 or so people who lost their jobs here Friday, there were undoubtedly some who understood the macro and micro factors that led American Home Mortgage Investment Corporation, one of the largest and fastest-growing mortgage companies in the country, to crash in a heap this week, even as it was hiring employees by the dozen.
 But most of the workers carrying rubber plants and boxes of family photos out of the company's headquarters were account clerks, appraisers, computer technicians and loan brokers who said they were stunned to find themselves, some after years of employment, on the street with virtually no notice. 
 ''You don't think you're in the slaughterhouse, and then suddenly something hits you on the back of the head and you find yourself rolling down the conveyer belt,'' said Frank Caltabellotta, 42, of West Islip, an appraisal specialist who was laid off. ''The way this happened was very undignified.''
 On Thursday, company officials notified all 7,000 employees in a dozen offices around the country, including the 1,400 here, that all but a skeleton crew of about 750 workers nationwide would be immediately laid off and that loan operations would be shut down.
 Michael Strauss, the chief executive, attributed the company's undoing to the weakening of the real estate market and of the secondary mortgage market, the commerce in financial instruments built from bundled mortgage obligations, which was American Home Mortgage's specialty. 
 American Home Mortgage traded in loans that fell into the category between low-risk and high-risk. Many were ''stated income'' mortgages -- variable rate and zero-money-down loans that require no income verification. Borrowers in that group are especially hard hit when market-rate interest payments come due on their loans. 
 But Blanca Castillo, who worked for three years as a call center coordinator, said the events that may have contributed to her unemployment were no excuse for the sudden and careless shedding of a loyal work force.
 ''Monday, there were rumors,'' Ms. Castillo said as she carried a cardboard box to her car, passing several potted plants that sat on the roof of another employee's car. ''Tuesday, they say not to worry about the rumors. Thursday, we're finished. They are giving us nothing -- no health benefits, no severance package, nothing. We have families, we have mortgages. That's it? Here's your last paycheck, goodbye?''
 A spokesman for American Home Mortgage could not be reached for comment. E-mail queries and telephone calls were not answered.
 Throughout the day, which for just about everyone was spent in a kind of limbo between losing one's job and actually leaving the building, employees huddled outside, smoking cigarettes, making cellphone calls or reading some of the fliers left on their car windshields. These mainly advertised jobs in the mortgage, debt collection and telephone sales industries. (''Top flight opportunity. We are willing to train bright, assertive persons for full and part-time positions,'' said one such flier for Asset Locators and Skip Tracers, a debt collection service.)
 Some of the employees seemed dazed, holding thin folders filled with information about unemployment benefits. 
 Christine Jackson, 25, said that besides the long-term employees -- some of them with the company since it was founded in 1998 -- the hardest hit among her co-workers seemed to be those who made their work cubicles into ''a little home away from home.'' The ones who surrounded themselves with family pictures, coffee makers and, in one case near Ms. Jackson's cubicle, a radio tuned softly to a jazz station. 
 ''There are people here who worked here since the beginning,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''They felt like this was their family.'' 
 Shawn Nuzzo, 31, a loan sales coordinator, said he sensed a shift in the market late last year. 
 ''Basically, the guy who puts no money down has a big incentive to walk away when interest rates go up,'' Mr. Nuzzo said. ''That started happening, and we made some adjustments. But obviously it was too little, too late.''
 At the side entrance to one of the company's two main buildings, Ronald Kleinberg, a commercial real estate salesman, pulled at one locked door after another until he was greeted by a security guard, who eyed him suspiciously.
 ''I have a job poster I want to put up,'' Mr. Kleinberg said. The poster said, ''Secretary Wanted.'' A dozen tabs with his phone number were scissor-cut along the edge. ''Would you mind if I put this up inside?''
 The security guard glanced behind him, then scanned the flock of soon-to-be-unemployed people standing outside. Then he let Mr. Kleinberg in.

HEADLINE: Living Modestly Despite a Nice Nest Egg

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

 BODY:
By Silicon Valley standards, Brian Wilson is not rich. But despite a nest egg of roughly $1.5 million -- small in comparison to many of his engineering friends' -- Mr. Wilson, 40, feels less anxious about his wealth than many of his peers. 
 Mr. Wilson, an engineer with a master's degree from Stanford University, rents rather than owns. And in the land of BMWs and Lamborghinis, he drives a 2002 Nissan Sentra. 
 Mr. Wilson is that rare Silicon Valley multimillionaire determined to live on a fixed budget rather than pursue a more expensive lifestyle simply because he can afford it. 
 ''I definitely have enough,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''I'm not stressed out about never earning an income ever again.'' 
 He seems to derive a kind of Zen pleasure through living modestly. He takes books out of his local public library rather than buying them at a store. He rents a one-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto, Calif., although he can afford a larger place. 
 By watching his dollars, Mr. Wilson said, he believes he can live off his assets even if he never earns another dime. He assumes the assets will grow by an average of about 8 percent a year, or at least $120,000 annually, which should leave him enough money to live well and reinvest for his future. 
 ''I figure I can live off between $70,000 to $100,000 a year, inflation-adjusted, for the rest of my life,'' he said. 
 Mr. Wilson points to the soaring cost of health insurance as one large worry. But then he quickly chides himself, adding that the average family of four in America gets by on half that amount. 
 ''Who's kidding who, $80,000 a year is a great living,'' he said. 
 In many ways, Mr. Wilson's story is that of many other working-class millionaires in Silicon Valley. After working at Apple, Excite and TiVo, among other technology companies, he co-founded an antispam company called MailFrontier in 2002.
 That company was sold to SonicWall in February 2006 for $31 million. Mr. Wilson stayed at SonicWall for six months (''to make sure my baby was in good hands,'' he said) before a six-month hiatus that included a 10,000-mile motorcycle jaunt across Canada and a ski trip to the Alps.
 ''It was an amazing experience but I couldn't afford to travel forever,'' he said. And despite $1.5 million in the bank, he also concluded that he could not afford to do nothing, at least if he wanted to maintain his sanity.
 ''What do you do when you're not vacationing?'' he said. ''Do I keep surfing through the 72 channels on cable hoping that this time through I find something meaningful?'' 
 In recent months, Mr. Wilson has kept busy working on a software project he calls BackBlaze that will allow users to automatically back up their documents, photographs and other digital files. Maybe he will make money on the project, but maybe he won't.
 ''That's what money has brought me,'' he said. ''I have the luxury of working without salary. I have the ability to make really bad financial decisions.''

HEADLINE: For British in an Afghan Province, Initial Gains Against the Taliban

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: SANGIN, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
The British Army compound here in a drug lord's former villa, with its sandbagged windows and lookout posts and shrapnel-scarred walls, is a reminder that until just a few weeks ago Sangin was one of the most dangerous towns in Afghanistan's most dangerous province, Helmand. 
 Since their arrival last spring in this lawless region of mountains and desert, British troops have lost 64 men in almost daily combat against a Taliban force second to none in size and ferocity in the country. The insurgents still control half the province, the most serious threat to Afghanistan's stability. 
 Yet despite the presence of thousands of Taliban fighters, and some tough fighting still ahead, British military commanders here say they believe they have turned a significant corner. In recent months they have succeeded in pushing the Taliban back and keeping them out of a few strategic areas. 
 At the same time, they say, popular support for the insurgents is eroding.
 ''We see it now as a threat that can be countered,'' Maj. Hamish Bell, second in command of the British battalion deployed in northern Helmand, said of the insurgency. 
 The progress in Helmand is perhaps the most important anywhere in the country, military commanders say, given that the province has the largest concentration of insurgents and produces 42 percent of Afghanistan's opium crop, which has helped fuel the insurgency. If they can get Helmand right, they say, it could pave the way to broader progress against the Taliban. 
 But while Helmand shows what is possible in Afghanistan, commanders warn that a long, hard fight remains to win back territory from the Taliban, region by region, village by village. Nearly six years into the war, a third of Afghanistan's provinces are in the grip of insurgents, a level far worse than it was from 2002 to 2005, the years immediately after the American-led invasion, when the Taliban were toppled and forced to retreat across the border into Pakistan. 
 Provinces like Helmand, remote from the capital and relatively calm, were only secured by a light American military presence, leaving them wide open when the Taliban chose to return.
 In the other southern provinces, Kandahar and Oruzgan, the Taliban presence remains strong. Fighting the Taliban is like pressing mercury or squeezing a balloon, commanders say: as insurgents are suppressed in one area, they emerge in another.
 And once pushed back in conventional fighting, the Taliban switch tactics to suicide attacks, roadside bombs and kidnappings. In one measure of the lingering dangers even here, in early July the 14-year-old son of Sangin's police chief was kidnapped on a road outside town and killed. 
 But military commanders say the progress in Helmand is an indication that NATO forces have found their stride since last year, when the Taliban staged a spectacular resurgence, taking advantage of the transfer of southern provinces from American commanders to an expanding NATO force. 
 As NATO forces have become better established and more numerous in southern Afghanistan, American forces have been able to deploy more troops in the east. There, they are also reporting gains in some border areas. All of this has helped NATO forces take the offensive against the Taliban, rather than fighting from their back foot, as they were forced to do last year, and gain local confidence. 
 ''I don't think the Taliban will come back,'' said Abdul Rahman, 45, a paramedic, the only qualified person working in a small private clinic here. ''They have been weakened.'' Also the people would not support the Taliban anymore, he said.
 What has made the difference here, the British say, is a shift in their tactics and a doubling of force numbers, to nearly 6,000 today, with more troops on the way. 
 When the British paratroopers arrived in Helmand, President Hamid Karzai asked that they focus on preventing small district centers from falling to the Taliban, so grave was the insurgent threat. Surrounded and cut off, the British came under attack up to seven times a day. They used artillery fire to clear an area just for supply helicopters to land.
 Over the winter they deployed mobile marine units to push the Taliban back from besieged district compounds and out of the town centers. In spring and summer, they staged sweeping operations, with help from American, Afghan and small Danish and Estonian units. 
 In May they pushed the Taliban out of the Sangin area. With three companies in the valley, they have since thwarted attempts by the insurgents to reinfiltrate.
 ''It's not over but indications are that the uplift in forces and the more offensive mind-set has been successful,'' said Maj. Dominic Biddick, 32, commander of Company A of the Royal Anglian Regiment, now based in Sangin. The British base, once virtually under siege, has not taken a single hit in a month, he said.
 The British have now been able to focus on their original counterinsurgency plan, which was to create ''inkblots,'' or secure zones around the main towns, and gradually expand security outward. In this way they are starting reconstruction projects in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, the town of Gereshk on the main road, and now Sangin. 
 Strategically located, Sangin, a rich agricultural town on the banks of the Helmand River, commands access to the north, where most of the Taliban are concentrated, and to the hydroelectric dam at Kajaki, a major United States development project.
 The Taliban threat remains even in these secure zones. But Lt. Col. Stuart Carver, who commands the Battle Group North, said, ''There aren't big groups of 50 Taliban roaming around town and taking over big parts of the town.'' 
 The strong British and Afghan security presence in Sangin has for the first time encouraged local Afghans to come forward with information on Taliban movements.
 This year, the Taliban have lost ground and men, including some high-level commanders, and are struggling to find recruits among the local population, Colonel Carver said. 
 NATO officials categorize the Taliban into two types of fighters. Tier one, as they are called, are hardened, ideologically driven men who have come back to fight from their rear base in Pakistan. Tier two fighters are local men who may join the war for a variety of reasons -- economic, tribal or religious.
 ''The biggest change from last year to this year is there has been no tier two mobilization,'' Colonel Carver said. ''They have tried,'' he said of the Taliban. 
 Still, military officers said, the Taliban never seem short of forces. They have filled out their ranks with foreign fighters, mainly Pakistanis, but also a handful of Arabs and Chechens, as well as Afghans from other provinces, like neighboring Oruzgan. 
 The military has found Pakistani identity cards on dead fighters, as well as papers and CDs with jihadi propaganda in Chechen and Arabic, one officer said. A large group of men from Pakistan's tribal area of Waziristan were killed in one battle, Colonel Carver said.
 But the weakening of the Taliban is apparent even to local people, like Hayatullah, 29, a farmer who fled northern Helmand last year and now lives near the main British camp, Bastian, in central Helmand. 
 ''The Taliban are not stronger,'' he said, ''If they were strong, they would come down and fight the British here.'' 
 Sangin, which was a ghost town three months ago, is struggling slowly back to life. Shops have reopened, while others lie in rubble, and the initial silent hostility toward the foreign troops is starting to thaw. 
 A few tribal elders have asked the military for help in clearing irrigation channels. Afghan, American and British military medics offered two days of free consultations in mid-July and were swamped by hundreds of people, including dozens of women and children. That was a step toward acceptance, Major Biddick said. 
 He and other commanders hope that momentum will build. 
 ''I think the big battle was for local support,'' Colonel Carver said. ''A proportion of the locals now think we are actually going to stay, and therefore they are prepared to throw their cards in with us. Before, they thought we were going to come in, kill a few Taliban and then leave.'' 
 ''It has gone from people too scared to even look at you or wave in case someone was watching, now they will talk,'' he added. ''It's a step forward that they will talk to you, and it's a real step forward that they talk to you as if you can solve their problems.''
 After a year and half of intense fighting, not all local people are persuaded, however. ''We don't expect good government, only bloodshed,'' said Hajji Mullah Fida Muhammad, an elderly man with a white beard. He said he thought the Taliban were still strong enough to win the town again. Others expected them to try again. 
 ''The Taliban is out there, so we expect more fighting,'' said Hajji Mullah Salim, 55, a cloth merchant. He had returned to open his shop, but his family was still camping out in the desert for safety, he said. 
 There is still talk of a Taliban offensive, but NATO commanders are keeping the pressure on the insurgents, and say the danger now is the shift in Taliban tactics, toward roadside and suicide bombs. The guerrilla tactics are threatening enough and can erode local support, as the local police chief, Hajji Ghulam Wali, can attest. 
 It was his son who was pulled out of a taxi and kidnapped by insurgents on the road from Sangin to the provincial capital. The Taliban commander, Tor Jan, taunted Hajji Wali on the telephone, telling him to quit his job to save his son. 
 When he refused, they bound his son's hands and feet with a chain and returned him dead, riddled with 20 bullets. Then, in mid-July, a bomb detonated in the pushcart of a boy as the police chief's car passed the town bazaar, killing four people, including the boy.
 ''They committed a terrible crime,'' Hajji Wali said of his son's killing. ''Islam does not permit such cruelty.'' 
 Still, he said, the town was safer. The Taliban, he insisted, ''have lost morale, they are weak now.''
 ''Before we could not go to the bazaar, but now they are hiding and cannot go to the bazaar,'' he said. 
 He, like several Afghan officials interviewed in the province, urged the British to press their advantage and finish the Taliban while the insurgents are down. 
 Wary of the ease with which the Taliban can reinfiltrate areas, the British are moving with care. British commanders said the job now was now to consolidate control of Sangin and Gereshk, rather than pursue Taliban in their holdouts. 
 ''We could deploy and clear the rest but the danger is if we clear the Taliban out we create a vacuum,'' Major Biddick, the British commander in Sangin, said. The Afghan government also needs to catch up in deploying more army and police to fill the vacuum, he added.
 ''This is setting the conditions 12 months in, and Afghanistan will be measured in decades, not years,'' the major said. ''We realize it is just the tip of the iceberg.''

HEADLINE: The Stock Is Secondhand, the Ambience Isn't

BYLINE: By GERRI HIRSHEY. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BROOKFIELD
 THOSE of us given to habitual Goodwill hunting in western Connecticut have noticed that something upscale has been astir amid the Corning Ware and vinyl go-go boots. It's a quiet revolution in quality reusables that is turning the charity's area stores into spacious, well-appointed, not-your-granny's thrift shops known as Goodwill Super Stores. Brand new or retrofitted, they boast bigger selling areas, color coordinated displays and gleaming new fixtures.
 ''If you build it nicer, they will come,'' according to David H. Turner, president of Goodwill Industries of Western Connecticut, who oversees 15 stores from Torrington to Stamford. Mr. Turner stood amid the preopening bustle of the newest 13,000-square-foot Super Store here on Federal Road. It was scheduled to have its official ribbon cutting on Friday with decidedly unthrifty hoopla: live radio coverage, discounts, refreshments and prizes. 
 Mr. Turner is hoping for an excellent first year in Brookfield, with projected gross revenues of $1.5 million to $2 million. In preparation, managers from other stores hustled to fill racks with designer jeans and juggled wineglasses and copper-clad pans in the housewares department. Outside, pavers and bulldozers smoothed the way for donors who will be able to make drive-through deliveries directly to a sheltered loading dock, a crucial asset according to Mr. Turner: 
 ''Brookfield has an upper middle-class demographic. Part of the new philosophy is to build where it's very accessible to the donors. We find that if you make it easy for donors, the shoppers will find there's good stuff at this place, and plenty of it.'' 
 The store is also easy to find, set in the middle of a growing bargain belt on Federal Road that extends past Costco to the popular Elephant's Trunk flea market in New Milford. 
 Mr. Turner says he is pleased with the overall progress of his 10-year campaign to tart up and streamline the dowager operation, including its headquarters and adjoining store in Bridgeport. ''It's a more realistic, better training experience for the people we serve,'' he said. ''I think there's an essential pride when you work in a real store instead of a mom and pop thrift operation.''
 Mr. Turner explained these exigencies in the relative quiet of what will be a computer learning center for workers, many with disabilities, brain injuries and cultural and economic disadvantages. Here, they will have access to software that helps with English as a second language, resume writing, job interview skills and money management. Last year, the charity provided 610,000 hours of training, employment and career advancement services to area residents. 
 These days, there's Lexus gridlock outside the Westport store where Fairfield County matrons deposit barely used Lilly Pulitzer togs -- and the occasional mink. Goodwill's store clerks study labels, the better to recognize and price those Manolo Blahnik shoes, Ralph Lauren dress shirts and pedigreed armoires. ''You don't want to be out of touch with the market,'' Mr. Turner said. ''There's a lot of people selling things on eBay that catch our mistakes.''
 It was polish or perish, according to Mr. Turner, who visits Goodwills around the nation in search of what he calls ''best practices'' business models: ''Resale is a very hot sector. People are really interested in finding treasures, whether it's from for-profit resale stores or charities. We're upscaling because it's a business necessity.''
 He says he first realized this on a trip to Portland, Ore., a decade ago. ''In the Pacific Northwest, there's a strong for-profit contingent of really large thrift stores, mostly from one family-run company doing business as Savers and Value Village,'' Mr. Turner said. ''They heard the wake-up call out there. It was either meet them on their own terms or be defeated in the marketplace.''
 Dedicated to ''keeping a tight focus,'' Mr. Turner does not see his stores adding coffee shop annexes as some have done in the Midwest. In his travels, he has seen some glorious Goodwills. The best? 
 ''Tampa, which has a big transient population needing and donating lots of goods, has a great, modernistic store, with lots of specialty services,'' he said. ''Austin, Tex., which sees itself as a sort of Silicon Gulch, has a computer store with a metallic modern motif and exposed beams -- not exactly Frank Gehry, but good stuff. Portland has a great bookstore, with a very sophisticated scanning system and comfortable places to sit and browse.''
 He would love to institute that cozy-but-efficient bookstore model here: ''In the next few years, we're going to develop a core competency for trainees in book evaluation and pricing. We sell a lot of books now, but it's rather haphazard.''
 In the Norwalk Super Store, I did find a mint first edition of Kitty Kelley's fanged 1978 Onassis take-down, ''Jackie Oh!,'' in between an Audubon bird guide and some sudoku paperbacks.
 ''Did you buy it?'' Mr. Turner wondered.
 ''Certainly not,'' sniffed this upscale shopper. Even at 50 cents, literary trash is still ... trash.

HEADLINE: Let the Beaches Retreat

BYLINE: By TOM CLAVIN. 
Tom Clavin is the co-author of ''Halsey's Typhoon: The True Story of a Fighting Admiral, an Epic Storm and an Untold Rescue.''

 BODY:
East Hampton
 LONG ISLAND is fortunate that only one truly powerful northeaster has struck it in 2007. That one storm, however, did significant damage, especially to the eastern part of Long Island where municipal budgets are smaller and, therefore, more reliant on county, state and federal money for shoreline repair.
Indeed, estimates are that more than 100,000 cubic yards of beach and dunes were removed between Sagaponack and Georgica Pond in East Hampton during that April storm. And while the official response was to replenish the shoreline with fresh sand, at $30 per cubic yard of sand, that's a lot of money -- money that the Towns of Southampton and East Hampton can't afford. Perhaps it's time to let nature takes its course and stop replenishing a shoreline that has become an endangered species. 
 Trying to hold the shoreline against nature's power by trucking in sand is becoming increasingly expensive -- and thanks to global warming, it's become a more common occurrence. According to a report by Representative Anthony Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of New York City, that is based on figures compiled by the Army Corps of Engineers, five beach renourishment projects on the south shore extending from Coney Island to the Shinnecock Canal will cost a total of $147 million. And this doesn't take into account emergency projects undertaken after storms like the one in April. 
 On the East Coast, Long Island is especially vulnerable to beach-damaging storm surges because it sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean. This is nothing new: ocean erosion has been a constant ever since the rising sea began striking the now-vanished third fork of the East End about 12,000 years ago. What is new is that the sea is rising more rapidly. 
 While the average summer temperatures in New York City have increased by seven-tenths of a degree per decade since 1950, during the last two decades, temperatures have been rising more rapidly, increasing by two degrees total in the last 20 years. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, by 2050 the climate on Long Island will be that of present-day Maryland. And although global sea levels have risen by four to eight inches during the last 100 years, in New York Harbor, levels have increased by an entire foot and are expected to increase by an additional five inches by 2030. 
 This means that Long Island beaches will be pounded by nasty storms in combination with a steadily rising water level. If we get hit by a storm that packs the same strength as Hurricane Bob, which did serious damage to the island 16 years ago this month, it won't be easy -- or perhaps even possible -- to find enough sand to repair our 1,180 miles of coastline. And every time there will be the same question: Who is going to pay for it?
 Officials and business leaders will argue that restored beaches are a quality of life issue and are vital to the Long Island economy. This is especially true on the East End, where without good beaches, swaths of tourists and their dollars would disappear. And while some experts argue that having restored dunes in place could lessen the amount of flooding when the big one hits, no one knows by how much. 
 Mother Nature is going to have her way no matter what we do and how much taxpayer money is spent. History tells us that many times the beaches restore themselves with waves redepositing sand at gouged shoreline spots -- indeed, this did take place after the April northeaster. What Long Island officials might want to attend to is figuring out Plan B, which takes into consideration that nature is stronger, has a lot more time than we do and that at some point hundreds of millions of dollars of federal, state and local money is too high a price to pay. 
 We can look to the other side of the Atlantic to see what the future of Long Island's shoreline is. The coast of East Anglia in England has been eroding for more than a century, but the erosion has accelerated in recent years. The government has stopped maintaining large parts of the network of sea walls that once protected the area. Scientists in England have labeled ''managed retreat'' the policy of governments in Europe and elsewhere of not spending taxpayer money to combat inevitable effects of climate change.
 Referring to the managed retreat policy, David Viner, a climate expert at the University of East Anglia, said, ''The U.K. won't let London flood, but the national government's not going to worry about an odd village or farm.'' Once the bills start piling up, the state and the federal government won't let New York City flood, but Long Island could be on its own. Local lawmakers need to plan for a Long Island with a gradually changing coastline.

Eminent Domain: a Question of Morality
To the Editor:
 In ''Now You Own It, Soon You Don't?'' (July 29), you quote the New York assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky as saying about eminent domain, ''The bottom line is we can fix the law so it protects average people and still maintain it as a tool.'' 
 Like bank robbers who maintain crowbars and guns as tools for stealing money, governments maintain eminent domain as a tool for stealing people's homes and businesses. 
 The first act of theft will get you thrown in jail. The second (taking property by eminent domain) will get you property for nothing, tax abatements, exemptions and deferments plus development funds. 
 Government was instituted to secure the rights to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and property (without which no other right can be secured). Taking homes and businesses from their rightful owners, then conveying them to those who are not, is a notorious example of how government has become the most blatant violator of these rights.
 Using eminent domain, government aids and abets theft and should be morally condemned. So should those who benefit from eminent domain. 
 Joe Wright Staten Island
 To the Editor:
 Another aspect of ''redevelopment'' is that a municipality can hold a property hostage for years. 
 I own a building, where I conduct my business, in Long Branch, N.J. We've been in the ''redevelopment zone'' for 10 years! During this time my property has become virtually unsalable. 
 Buyers are reluctant to purchase properties located in redevelopment zones because of the potential for economic loss. Several times potential buyers have told me that because of the redevelopment designation they were not interested in my property. 
 This should, but probably won't, be addressed by the state Legislature.

HEADLINE: Turning to 'Hard Money' Lenders

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
IN decades past, borrowers who were turned away from traditional mortgage lenders turned to the private lending market, where wealthy individuals or small companies offered mortgages with much higher interest rates. Now, because of the subprime crisis, banks are again turning away borrowers with poor credit, and industry executives expect these borrowers will again turn to so-called ''hard money'' lenders. This time, though, borrowers will have more legal protection against unscrupulous lenders.
 ''Lenders aren't as interested now in lending to some individuals because they're going to have a harder time repaying,'' said Hugh Bromma, the chief executive of the Entrust Group Inc., a financial advisory company in Reno, Nev., that helps clients lend money on the private market, among other things. ''Those people will have to go to private lenders, where the standards are significantly different.'' 
Mr. Bromma and other industry executives said private lenders typically demand interest rates of at least 12 percent, and they will make loans only when the borrower has more than 30 percent equity in the house. Such borrowers may have large down payments from, say, a house sale or an inheritance, but they may have low credit scores. 
 Lenders can demand even higher interest rates and equity minimums depending on how much of a credit risk the borrower appears to be. That is because if the borrower defaults, the lender must follow a foreclosure process that can be very costly, especially in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. (In other states like Texas, lenders can foreclose much more quickly and cheaply.) Application fees, too, are much higher.
 Finding hard-money lenders can be difficult, since they are typically small operations that lend cash only for homes within a limited geographical range. Among other things, this helps them more fully understand the risks, and resale potential, of the homes. Some brokers will refer clients to hard-money lenders when conventional financing fails.
 Hard-money lenders usually avoid states that have enacted tighter regulations. For example, in 2001 Connecticut passed the Abusive Home Loan Act that, like similar legislation in New York and New Jersey, goes beyond federal laws regulating lenders that make so-called ''high cost'' loans, or those with interest rates at least eight percentage points more than the Treasury note or bond with a maturity date closest to that of the prospective mortgage. (Last Tuesday, for instance, rates on the 30-year Treasury note stood at 4.75 percent, so 30-year mortgages with interest rates of 12.75 percent would be considered high-cost loans.)
 Among other things, the Connecticut legislation also stipulates that lenders making such loans cannot charge prepayment penalties of more than 3 percent during the first year of the loan, 2 percent after the second year, 1 percent after the third and nothing beyond that. Closing fees cannot exceed $2,000 or 5 percent of the principal, whichever is higher.
 Carmine Costa, the manager of the Connecticut Banking Department, said, ''Almost all lenders have shied away from high-cost loans because of all the possible litigation and violations of various state statutes.'' But some, he added, may lend money ''just under'' the eight-point threshold that triggers the regulations.
 Frank Harrison, the managing director of Prime Asset Funding, a hard-money lender in Greenwich, Conn., said he had stopped making residential loans in recent years ''because we got more worried about the litigious nature of these, and with more foreclosures in the market, there's going to be more litigation.''
 Mr. Harrison, who now lends money only for commercial real estate projects, said that even with stronger laws in place, borrowers seeking hard-money mortgages for homes should be on alert to abuse.

HEADLINE: Parks Manager Fired in Swastika Incident

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
Parks Manager Fired in Swastika Incident
 A parks department supervisor in Greenwich was fired for leaving a board with a swastika painted on it on another supervisor's desk in March.
 Craig Whitcomb, who was the operations manager for the parks department's marine and facilities division, was fired on July 27. Mr. Whitcomb had worked for the town for about 13 years.
 According to an investigation by the town, Mr. Whitcomb ordered a worker, Hank Walsh, to paint the swastika, with a circle around it and a line through it, on a board that was left on the desk of Otto Lauersdorf, who is of German heritage. 
 Mr. Walsh was given a letter of reprimand by the town for painting the swastika. The Teamsters Local 456, which represents him, said it planned to file a grievance over the letter.
 Mr. Whitcomb had been on administrative leave since June 14, when Mr. Lauersdorf filed a complaint about the incident with the ConnecticutCommission on Human Rights and Opportunities and the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
 A grievance hearing for Mr. Whitcomb was held last Monday to determine if his firing would be upheld. The first selectman of Greenwich, James A. Lash, said he would render a decision within 10 days.
 Mr. Lash said Mr. Whitcomb's actions were not worthy of a department supervisor.
 ''The town has very clear policies about racial and ethnic discrimination, and this was clearly an example of an ethnic incident,'' he said. ''And this was an incident that was caused by a second-level supervisor who, as part of his job responsibility, is supposed to set the tone for day-to-day operations. And this is clearly not what the town's policy calls for.''
 Mr. Lauersdorf's lawyer, Gary Phelan, said the swastika was only one example of his client being ''harassed'' by Mr. Whitcomb. 
 Mr. Whitcomb's phone number is unlisted and the town would not provide it. The Laborers' International Union of North America, which represents him, did not return calls.
 Mr. Phelan said that while the firing of Mr. Whitcomb was appropriate, Mr. Lauersdorf would seek a monetary settlement from the town.
 ''We are also looking for a change in the workplace culture, so that the environment that resulted in behavior like this will not occur,'' he said.
 Pitney Bowes to Outsource Jobs to India-Based Firm
 Pitney Bowes, the Stamford-based company best known for making postage meters, announced last week that it would shed approximately 200 of its computer networking jobs by the end of the year.
 The jobs at plants in Danbury, Shelton and Stamford, and in Colonie, N.Y., will be outsourced to Wipro Technologies, a company based in India with operations throughout the world, to save money, the company said.
 Matthew J. Broder, a spokesman for Pitney Bowes, said Tuesday that about 100 of the workers whose jobs would be affected would be given the chance to work at Pitney Bowes in Danbury as Wipro Technologies employees. He said the others would be offered the opportunity to apply for jobs elsewhere with Wipro.
 ''They are better and more efficient at managing those jobs than we are,'' he said, referring to Wipro. ''That is not what we do for a living. By partnering with them, we can get the same quality and level of service, but for a lot less money.''
 Mr. Broder would not say how much the company would save. Workers who choose not to work for Wipro will not receive any severance, Mr. Broder said. ''They would be considered resigning from the company,'' he said.
 Mr. Broder said those who went to work for Wipro would be paid comparable to what they were getting at Pitney Bowes.
 A spokeswoman for Wipro did not return calls.
 The state's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said Wednesday that he was looking into a variety of issues involving the deal between the two companies.
 ''We are concerned that declaring workers who do not want to work for Wipro as resigned could prevent them from applying for unemployment benefits,'' he said.
 Mayflower Inn Is Sold to a California Company
 The Mayflower Inn and Spa in Washington, considered one of the most luxurious resorts in the country, has been sold to a California company, American Property Management, for an undisclosed price.
 Under the terms of the sale, which was announced Monday, the Mnuchin family, which had owned the resort since 1990, will continue to operate it. One of the former owners, Adriana Mnuchin, said all of the management and staff would be retained.
 ''They will be the financial arm, and let us enhance and improve it in every and any way possible,'' she said, referring to American Property Management.
 The Mayflower Inn opened in the 1920s but closed in 1987. The Mnuchins bought it in 1990 and reopened it in 1992, adding a 20,000-square-foot spa last year.
 The Mayflower Inn sits on 58 acres and has 4 restaurant areas and 30 rooms, which range from $450 to $1,400 a night.
 The Mayflower Inn received competition for its wealthy and famous clientele in November when the Winvian resort, with various themed rooms and rates that start at $1,450 a night, opened eight miles away in Morris. 
 Mrs. Mnuchin, however, said that the opening of the Winvian had not affected the Mayflower Inn. ''It really is a very different kind of place,'' she said.
 American Property Management owns and operates 45 hotels, most in the southwestern United States and Mexico. The Mayflower Inn and Spa is the first hotel it has bought in New England.

HEADLINE: Government May Step In To Save Birds From Cats In Cape May

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: CAPE MAY, N.J., Aug. 4 

 BODY:
In most other cities, cats killing birds would not attract much attention. But this is not most other cities.
 Cats are as much a part of genteel Cape May culture as rainbow-colored Victorian bed-and-breakfasts, trolley tours and cocktails on the porch at sunset.
 But Cape May is also one of the prime bird-watching spots in North America, and the activity is important to the state's economy. The World Series of Birding is held here each year. 
 This year in New Jersey, cats are the prime suspects in the deaths of three endangered birds, including piping plovers. With only 115 pairs of plovers left in the state, each death is a big deal to environmentalists.
 The federal government may intervene on the side of the birds, drawing mixed reactions here. Cat lovers fear that the cats will be euthanized, while bird lovers are wary of the possibility of rare species being wiped out.
 ''This is a very emotional issue; this really is a cat town,'' said one resident, Pat Peckham. ''I think they should leave the cats where they are. I'm a firm believer in letting nature take its course.''
 Bill Schemel called the cats ''more of a nuisance than anything else.'' He added: ''Cats are not part of the natural environment. They're here because someone's cat had a litter and they dumped them out in the woods.''
 Jim Cramer, a spokesman for United States Fish and Wildlife Service, agreed that that is the root of the problem. ''In an ideal world, we wouldn't have feral cat populations,'' he said. ''All cats would be given good homes and be kept indoors. But that's not the reality we're dealing with.''
 The stakes are high. Wildlife watching and related expenditures pump more than $2 billion a year into the state economy, about 80 percent of which comes from bird-watchers, said Eric Stiles, vice president of the New Jersey Audubon Society.
 Few people might have taken notice of the colonies of feral cats here had it not been for the presence of the piping plover, which is considered threatened by the federal government and endangered by New Jersey environmental authorities.
 The plovers nest in open stretches of beach, making them and their chicks easy prey for predators, including foxes, gulls and cats.
 As part of federally mandated beach management programs, communities with populations of threatened or endangered species are required to prevent the birds from being harmed. And those measures are paying off: plover populations along the East Coast have rebounded to 1,743 pairs this year from 722 pairs in 1985, federal officials said.
 For the past 12 years, Cape May has sought to keep its cat population in check by trapping, neutering and releasing feral cats, said John Queenan, the city's animal control officer.
 Annette Scherer, a senior biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service, said the agency was studying options for Cape May. They could include asking the city to adopt laws requiring cats to be licensed and laws prohibiting free-roaming cats, the abandonment of cats and the feeding of wildlife, including feral cats.
 Mr. Stiles, the Audubon Society official, is working on a pilot project to find a middle ground. It would bring together animal control officials and advocacy groups to share information on endangered birds and cat colonies. Cats that are near endangered birds could be relocated, while others could be undisturbed.
 ''Cape May would be perfect for this,'' he said. ''You really can do both.''

HEADLINE: Privately Financed Condos in Mott Haven

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
MOTT HAVEN, a hard-luck neighborhood in the South Bronx, is getting its first-ever condominium project to be built with private financing, according to Wilhelm Ronda, the director of planning and development for Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president. 
 The project, called Bronx Bricks, is a five-story, red-brick former print shop at 305 East 140th Street, between Third and Alexander Avenues. The building will have 11 units in two sizes, 1,300 and 2,200 square feet. Each has an open floor plan and maple floors original to the 1904 building.
 Prices are $395,000 to $795,000, and since sales began last month, two units have gone into contract, said Linda Cunningham, a managing partner on the development team. Like Ms. Cunningham, who made photo-transfer collages in the building, many of the team members are artists who used to have studios there. 
 Ms. Cunningham has been a co-owner of the building since 2000, when she bought it from Ernest Milchman, the founder of Milchman Enterprises, a developer based in New York. (Both refused to say what they had paid.) 
 Ms. Cunningham is taking one of the two 2,000-square-foot ground-floor commercial spaces. The other will most likely be leased to a nonprofit group or to an architect, she said.
 ''It was a challenge to be the first,'' Ms. Cunningham said. ''But now we can serve as the comparable for banks for future development.''
 Financing for Bronx Bricks came from the Community Preservation Corporation, a lender that specializes in rehabilitating multifamily homes in the region. 
 The project bodes well for the neighborhood, which has the ingredients for a full-blown revival, said Richard Ross, the vice president for real estate development at the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, known as SoBro. 
 ''You know the potential is here, because of the character of the buildings and the proximity to Manhattan,'' he said. 
 Bronx Bricks sits just outside the Mott Haven Historic District, which is lined with well-kept row houses, some graced with tall stoops and stained-glass windows. A stop for the No. 6 train is just two blocks away.
 But in an impoverished area, private development can cut both ways, according to Miquela Craytor, the deputy director of Sustainable South Bronx, a land-use advocacy group. Investment in neglected buildings can improve streetscapes, she said, yet market-rate condos will be priced out of the reach of most of the neighborhood residents. 
 ''Is it helping out the folks who have weathered the storm here?'' Ms. Craytor asked. ''Or is it just benefiting the new residents?''

HEADLINE: When Loggers Become Bloggers

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABAN. 
Jonathan Raban is the author, most recently, of the essay collection ''My Holy War'' and the novel ''Surveillance.''

 BODY:
Seattle
 THE town of Forks, Wash., on the rain-drenched western side of the Olympic Peninsula, is a four-hour trip by road and ferry from Seattle. Billing itself as the ''Logging Capital of the World,'' it was a big-eating, hard-drinking town -- one of many in the state that kept Seattle supplied with the timber on which the city's early wealth was based. 
 Seattle's sawmills and shipyards grew fat on logs trucked east from Forks, and when William Boeing built his first planes, their delicate frames were fashioned by yacht builders out of Peninsula spruce. The twin successes of Seattle and Forks went hand in hand, until the city and the town went through a bitter divorce. 
 When I first drove through Forks in 1990, plaintive yard signs read, ''This Family Lives on Timber Dollars''; bumper stickers asked, ''Are You an Environmentalist or Do You Work for a Living?'' and offered recipes for how best to roast or fry the northern spotted owl. 
 The owl's listing as a threatened species and the subsequent restrictions on logging on federal lands were widely seen on the Peninsula as the heartless work of condo-dwelling zealots in Seattle. The city that Forks had helped make rich appeared intent on beggaring Forks with a doctrinaire belief in the inviolable sanctity of the forest understory. To environmentalists, the forest was ecologically essential, irreplaceable, beyond price; Forks clung ever more stubbornly to the notion that it was a ''renewable resource,'' to be priced in board-feet, cut down and replanted.
 Forks slumped. Suddenly there was hardly a logging truck to be seen on Route 101, and the town's once-busy main street became a battered colonnade of crumbling facades and closed businesses. This street is still all that most Seattle tourists, en route to the rain forest or resorts on the coast, ever see of Forks, as they brake for its lone stoplight. I've been asking Seattleites to name the first word that comes to mind when I mention Forks: answers include ''forlorn,'' ''Godforsaken'' and ''ugly.''
 Yet turn off the main street, past the small high school, home of the aptly named Forks Spartans, and you find yourself in a pleasant grid of spacious bungalows, fresh paint, trim lawns and palpable neighborliness -- exactly the kind of intimate, self-contained rural community (with a huge village store named Forks Outfitters) for which jaded urbanites profess nostalgia. Since the near-collapse of the timber industry in the town, increased tourism and the nearby jail have taken up much slack in the local economy. 
 But Forks would dearly like to acquire a modest share of Seattle's genius for spinning money in cyberspace. After the extreme rancor of the divorce proceedings, here are potential grounds for amicable reconciliation. 
 The high school, thanks to a Gates Foundation grant, is the first rural ''high-tech high'' in the nation. Forks has broadband, houses that cost a quarter of those in Seattle and, right on its doorstep, the recreational opportunities that Seattleites so prize -- fly-fishing for salmon and steelhead, the razor-edged mountains of the Olympic National Park, old-growth temperate rain forest (what little is left after generations of clear-cutting), mile after mile of wild and barely visited Pacific beaches. The Business Incubation Center on Spartan Avenue has vacant offices available for peppercorn rents. 
 It'd be nice to report that nature-hungry telecommuters and Internet starter-uppers are homing in on Forks as the new, green, wired place to be, but so far there've been few takers. Maybe it's the rain (around 120 inches a year) or the deceptive stoplight view of the main street. The enduring suspicion of some rural hinterlanders is that the Northwest's precious environment, of mountains, forest, ocean, is merely an urban weekend amenity, to be saved from the local yokels by crusading Seattleites who recoil from the prospect of actually living in it.
 As for the spotted owl, chief emblem of the rift between city and countryside, its numbers go on shrinking because -- in an ironic parallel -- it's getting robbed of its traditional terrain and livelihood by the barred owl, its burlier, more aggressive eastern cousin.

HEADLINE: The Loan Comes Due

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
SUDDENLY it's not so easy to borrow. 
 That is true for homeowners, and it is true for companies.
 Only two months ago, it seemed as if almost any company could borrow money at low interest rates. Now loans seem to be drying up everywhere.
 What had seemed like a contained problem, involving home loans to people with poor credit, has suddenly mushroomed into a rout that threatens to make life difficult for everyone who needs to borrow money. 
 Home buyers are likely to pay more for mortgages, and some with less-than-pristine credit or an inability to come up with a down payment may find they no longer can borrow at all. 
 A German bank had to be rescued by other banks last week, because it had speculated in securities backed by American mortgages. One of the biggest mortgage lenders in the United States collapsed, and another said it would drastically scale back its lending because it cannot find investors willing to finance the loans it makes. 
 The volume of new high-yield bonds -- also known as junk bonds -- fell by 89 percent in July. The market for loans to highly leveraged companies has almost dried up. Standard & Poor's counts $35 billion in corporate loans that have been delayed or canceled, including loans to finance the leveraged buyout of Chrysler.
 The Chrysler deal will go through, because banks had promised to lend the money if others would not take the loans. But from now on there are likely to be fewer corporate takeovers, and those that do take place are likely to be at lower prices. ''This is a classic credit correction,'' said Jack Malvey, the chief global fixed income strategist for Lehman Brothers. ''The magnitude of risk was significantly underappreciated.''
 Mutual fund investors have been pulling back rapidly, with more than $1.3 billion coming out of funds that invest in leveraged loans during recent weeks, and $2.7 billion leaving funds that buy high-yield bonds, according to AMG Data Services.
 Hedge funds, which had been major buyers of complicated securities that financed leveraged loans and mortgages, have also pulled back. Some investors have tried to pull money out of such hedge funds, leading Bear Stearns to stop investors from making withdrawals from three of its funds.
 ''That is the core of a financial crisis, when too many people head to the exits simultaneously,'' said Robert Bruner, the dean of the business school at the University of Virginia.
 Mr. Bruner is the co-author of a book on the Panic of 1907, to be published next month, and he sees similarities between then and now. ''It was a time marked by the rise of new financial institutions and new financial instruments,'' he said. ''It marked the end of a period of extraordinary growth, from 1895 to 1907.''
 The credit market has changed drastically in recent years, as banks grew far less important and credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's became the essential players in the new financial architecture.
 Many loans, whether mortgages or loans to corporations, were financed by selling securities. It was the credit agency ratings that determined if those securities could be sold, and deals were structured to meet the criteria set by the agencies.
 Those criteria turned out to be very generous. The agencies figured that even very risky loans were unlikely to cause big losses, and so most of the securities backed by loans to poor credit risks could get AAA ratings -- the highest available -- as long as those securities had first claim on loan payments. Investors bought the securities thinking they were completely safe, and some did so with borrowed money. 
 Now, however, there is fear even about those securities. The rating agencies are changing their criteria for the loans, and many investors no longer trust the ratings.
 The markets are ''very panicked and illiquid,'' said Mike Perry, the chief executive of IndyMac Bank, the ninth largest mortgage lender in the first half of this year, as he announced plans last week to curtail lending sharply. It is very difficult, he said, to find buyers even for the AAA securities.
 All this has happened with few defaults. Mortgage delinquencies are up, particularly on loans made in 2006 when credit standards were very low, but the real problem is that lenders and investors fear things will get much worse.''This is what we would characterize as the first correction of the modern neo-credit market,'' said Mr. Malvey of Lehman Brothers. ''We've never had a correction with these types of institutions and these types of instruments.''
 It now seems likely that the rating agencies, and investors, were lured into a false sense of security by the lack of defaults. With the value of homes, and companies, rising, it was usually possible for a borrower in trouble to refinance the debt or, at worst, sell the home or business. Either way, lenders got paid.
 Now, there is less confidence that rising prices will bail out lenders, and there is doubt not only about the quality of old loans but also about important parts of the new financial system.
 ''The markets seem to be expressing concern about the performance and the stability of hedge funds and, to a lesser extent, private equity funds,'' said Mr. Bruner.
 The credit squeeze is coming at a time when the American economy seems to be growing, despite problems in the housing market, and the world economy is strong. ''The underlying economy is very healthy,'' said Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, as he visited China last week. But a good economy in no way precludes credit problems. In fact, it is during good economic times that credit standards are most likely to be so lax that bad loans are made.
 ''Financial panics don't happen during depressions,'' said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. ''They happen on the brink of depressions. The claim the world is prosperous is beside the point.''
 Not all panics lead to economic downturns, of course, and if this one continues pressure will grow on the Fed and other central banks to lower the short-term interest rates they control and thus stimulate the economy.
 But central banks do not always determine what happens in credit markets. 
 ''The Fed tightened in 2005 and 2006, but creative financing on Wall Street blunted the impact,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, a research firm. ''The collapse of that option in the last 90 days means the entirety of that tightening is arriving now, and there is a violent tightening going on.''
 Of course, this phase will pass. The insurance companies and pension funds that are the traditional buyers of bonds always have money coming in, from interest payments and bond maturities, as well as from new business, and they will have to put it to work.
 ''The history is that lenders move in great caravans between two extreme points, which we can call stringency and accommodation,'' said Mr. Grant, recalling how hard it was for companies to get loans as recently as 2002. 
 Lenders will move back to accommodation one day, he said, but for now it appears that risky borrowers,whether of the corporate or individual variety, will discover that it's much more difficult to find someone to lend money to them.

BYLINE: By LEE SMITH. 
Lee Smith is the author, most recently, of the novel ''On Agate Hill.''

 BODY:
Todd, N.C.
 WHEN we bought our mountain cabin here two decades ago, Todd was almost a ghost town. Only the General Store (established 1914) had stayed open since Todd's heyday back in the early 1900s. 
 But this summer evening, I find a traffic jam when I head into town (population only 50, but 900-plus in the area) to hear some old-time music at the store's Friday jam, and check out the dance at the old Mercantile building. 
 I have to park way up Big Hill Road and walk back down along the New River. I have to elbow my way into the Mercantile, where the wooden dance floor is jammed with people of all ages, spiky-haired teenagers mixed in with tourists and old guys in overalls, everybody dancing up a storm to the music of Cecil Gurganus and his Laurel Creek String Band, spotlighting a 14-year-old fiddler, Meade Richter. 
 Who are all these people? What happened to turn this town around?
 The citizens stepped up and took charge, that's what. In this, they were guided by the charismatic Becky Anderson, who started HandMade in America, a fiercely regional nonprofit organization dedicated to revitalizing and establishing a sustainable economy around the culture of western North Carolina -- an innovative ''creative economy'' emphasizing heritage and cultural tourism. 
 Since the mid-1990s, HandMade has been helping communities learn how to sell themselves without selling out. Its Small Towns Program is based on encouraging self-help, providing technical advice, fund-raising and strengthening bonds among the area's towns. 
 I attended the group's annual Small Towns Cluster meeting on May 22 in Asheville, where leaders from 13 local places gathered to share their triumphs and woes in an atmosphere something like a cross between a family reunion and a religious revival. 
 ''We learn from other communities,'' says Beth Morrison, the representative from Todd. ''We don't really feel like we're in competition. We're scattered, and we're not doing the same thing. We're doing a lot of music at Todd, for instance, while West Jefferson is doing art'' -- like barn quilts and murals.
 Each town has a particular strength. Crossnore prides itself on its weaving industry, children's home and new medical center. Marshall is putting 28 art studio spaces into an old high school. Andrews revels in its Scottish-American heritage, playing host to the Appalachian Highland Games. Hayesville built a ''Jackrabbit Trail'' for mountain biking and hiking -- ''It's amazing what a 12-pack of beer and a chain saw will do,'' said its delegate, Rob Tiger. 
 ''Todd would not be here today if we had not relied upon HandMade for guidance,'' says Emilie Enzmann, who owns the Mercantile as well as the Todd Mahal Bakery. 
 Other recent Todd enterprises include New River Adventures (kayak, canoe, bike and tube rentals in the old depot building); a farmers' market; several new nursery and landscaping businesses; and Community Supported Agriculture programs like Stacy Martin's Yellow Wolf Farm (check out the holistic dog biscuits).
 I've signed up for a trout-fishing lesson at RiverGirl with Kelly McCoy, who sold literally everything she owned in order to go into business a year ago. I find her down at the depot along with her potbellied pig, Petunia, three or four little yapping dogs and a crippled baby goat named Jackson.
 We get the rods (Kelly made them) and I try casting for the first time. 
 ''Throw it out at 10 o'clock, pull it back at 2,'' Kelly instructs in her Alabama drawl -- and hey! the yellow tippet lands flat out on the grass exactly as it's supposed to. 
 With a fisheries science degree from Mississippi State, Kelly used to do species identification with a group in Florida. ''We'd talk about life, we'd talk about everything,'' she recalls. ''We always talked about what we'd put in our shop, if we had our own shop ... and now I'm doing it. I'm really doing it. And they're all living vicariously through me. I wake up every day and think I'm in paradise.''

 Eisenhower, MacArthur, Marshall: Three Generals Who Saved the American Century.
 By Stanley Weintraub.

 George Marshall and Dwight Eisenhower 
 in War and Peace.
 By Mark Perry.
 Illustrated. 472 pp. The Penguin Press. $29.95.
Every American generation looks at history through the lens of its own preoccupations. If a book on those towering World War II generals Dwight Eisenhower, George Marshall and Douglas MacArthur had been published in the late 1960s or early '70s, at the zenith of anti-Vietnam War sentiment, many readers would have found it (in a catchphrase of the time) ''not relevant.''
 Some of the most vehement doves might have complained that a book hailing our involvement in World War II -- or any war -- was a malign gift to the hawks. Hadn't Lyndon Johnson defended his Vietnam escalation by insisting that he didn't want another Munich? 
 Had such a book been issued in the 1990s, at the peak of a World War II craze that embraced Tom Brokaw's ''Greatest Generation,'' Steven Spielberg's ''Saving Private Ryan'' and, later, ''Band of Brothers'' on HBO, it would have been a stirring reminder of how military leaders of unquestioned character led a united country against the armies of unimaginable evil.
 How about now? Well, it would be difficult for even the most nonpolitical reader to scan more than a few pages of Stanley Weintraub's ''15 Stars'' or Mark Perry's ''Partners in Command'' without grimly noting the gargantuan difference between those sunlit accounts of our World War II commanders and the more troubling reports about the United States generals in the Iraq war.
 If the American adventure in Iraq crumbles like Vietnam, future Americans may focus on how a wise Gen. Eric Shinseki jeopardized his career by testifying before Congress that more forces would be necessary to do the job than were being deployed; he was promptly dressed down by the administration. In contrast to the hosannas tossed upon MacArthur, Eisenhower and Marshall, some of our Iraq war generals may suffer the same fate as Gen. William Westmoreland, who, chained forever to the Vietnam catastrophe, spent the rest of his life trying to explain himself to people who would not listen.
 When the Vietnam effort failed, Americans asked the same question about our military leadership that many are now asking about current officers: did the generals give the White House bad advice, or were they overruled?
 These books by Weintraub and Perry are both competent studies. Neither breaks any notably new ground. The endnotes in both volumes include relatively few references to fresh, unpublished sources. Neither offers a startling angle or theme that alters our existing view of these famous generals.
 Yet, though told before, the story of such incandescent, flawed men and their rivalries, tensions and triumphs will always attract readers. And as we absorb the worst news from Iraq, these two books allow us to ponder the crucial relationship that exists between a president and his top commanders.
 Both Weintraub, the author of several books on war, and Perry, who has written on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the C.I.A. and the Civil War, offer many examples of how even the domineering Franklin Roosevelt could not bend General Marshall's backbone -- though not for lack of trying. As Perry shows, in 1938, Roosevelt tried to pressure Marshall, then the Army's deputy chief of staff, into consenting to a delay in the development of large ground forces until seven airplane factories could be built.
 As a dozen officials' bobbleheads went up and down, Roosevelt asked Marshall, ''Don't you think so, George?'' Marshall resented Roosevelt's ''misrepresentation of our intimacy.'' He said, ''I am sorry, Mr. President, but I don't agree with that at all.'' As Marshall later recalled, Roosevelt ''gave me a startled look, and when I went out they all bade me goodbye and said that my tour in Washington was over.''
 It wasn't. Roosevelt was not used to such frank disagreement in large meetings, but he admired Marshall's grit and conviction and soon promoted him.
 We will not know the full extent of how the balance of power between George W. Bush and his generals shaped the Iraq war until declassified documents are released decades from now. But the story of Roosevelt and Marshall, as rendered by both Perry and Weintraub, is an object lesson in how even the most iron-willed president must always have strong, independent-minded commanders and, no less important, be willing to listen intently to them.
 Weintraub tells how, in May 1940, as Hitler's soldiers marched through Europe, Roosevelt refused a $657 million request to expand the Army. He was eager to strengthen American defense but feared that if he ran for a third term that fall, it might send the ''wrong signal'' to voters worried that he would drag them into war.
 Marshall recited a long list of the Army's inadequacies and warned the president, ''If you don't do something, and do it right away -- I don't know what is going to happen to this country.'' Although nervous about the fall campaign, Roosevelt buckled, giving the general much of what he wanted. Had Marshall kept quiet to please the boss, the United States Army would not have been so well prepared when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.
 Weintraub's account of Douglas MacArthur's post-World War II years reminds us that presidents must also be willing to risk their political lives, if necessary, to keep their top generals in line. For months, President Harry Truman bridled at what he considered MacArthur's growing insubordination while commanding United States forces in the Korean War. 
 Truman realized that firing the popular MacArthur at the nadir of a stalemated, unpopular conflict would unleash the hounds of political hell. As Weintraub notes, he knew ''he might have to replay the conflict between Lincoln and Maj. Gen. George McClellan, who went on after his sacking to become the presidential candidate for the opposition.'' But Truman also understood that he had to reassert civilian control of the military.
 A lifelong Army man, Eisenhower had watched Marshall and MacArthur during their differences with Roosevelt and Truman. When he entered the White House in 1953, he was probably better schooled to know both the importance and the limits of military advice than any other president of his century.
 Though the story does not appear in either book, in the late 1950s, Eisenhower's generals -- especially in the Air Force -- were clamoring for a huge increase in the defense budget. The Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, was declaring that his country was cranking out planes and nuclear missiles ''like sausages'' and would soon overtake the United States.
 Knowing from secret intelligence that Khrushchev's claims were a fraud, Eisenhower held down military spending. His fortitude opened him to charges from Senator John F. Kennedy and other politicians that he was tolerating a ''missile gap'' and leaving America undefended. But his decision probably meant the country was able to avoid the ruinous inflation that afflicted its economy in later years.
 In case that does not persuade you of how important it is to have presidents with the wisdom and experience to know when, and when not, to take military advice, it is worth remembering that Ike was the leader in 1954 who scoffed at warnings that the free world would be in peril unless we immediately went to fight in Vietnam.

HEADLINE: The Katrina Effect, Measured in Gigs

BYLINE: By ANDREW PARK

 BODY:
New Orleans
 ON a recent sultry afternoon here, Tipitina's -- arguably the most famous musical haunt in a city famous for its music -- is eerily quiet. This ramshackle, two-story yellow joint at the corner of Napoleon and Tchoupitoulas won't start jumping until after dark, when Ivan Neville and his band, Dumpstaphunk, take center stage. 
 But upstairs, past balconies smelling of stale beer and cigarettes, past walls plastered with yellowed concert posters, musicians are working. Some edit concert fliers, tweak Web sites or research overseas jazz festivals; others get legal advice or mix audio and video; others simply chatter about who has found gigs and who is still struggling.
 Since late 2005, just a few months after Hurricane Katrina tore through this city, more than 1,000 New Orleans musicians have become members of Tipitina's three cooperative music offices. ''I go in sometimes and all I'm doing is checking my e-mails,'' says Margie Perez, an effervescent blues singer. 
 For Ms. Perez and others trying to rebuild fragile livelihoods as artists, grass-roots efforts like the co-ops have been a boon, helping them to replace lost or damaged instruments and sound equipment, arranging and subsidizing gigs and providing transportation, health care and housing. The Tipitina's Foundation, the club's charitable arm, has distributed about $1.5 million in aid; in all, Tipitina's and other nonprofit groups have marshaled tens of millions of dollars in relief from around the world to help bolster the music business here.
 But it remains to be seen how long a loose-knit band of charities can stand in for coordinated economic development in one of New Orleans's most important business sectors. Although New Orleans is one of the country's most culturally distinct cities, a large-scale recording industry never took root here, even before Katrina. Yet the informal music sector, the kind visitors find in clubs and bars, and large-scale musical events like Jazz Fest, is a mainstay of the city's tourism business.
 In fact, local authorities say, music and cuisine are the twin pillars of the tourism industry here; the leisure and hospitality businesses account for almost 63,000 jobs in the city and for about 35 percent of the sales taxes. Both of those figures are larger than those of any other business sector, including the energy industry. 
 Still, nearly two years after Katrina, there are fewer restaurants and bars offering live music, and the ones that do are paying less, musicians say. As the reality of the slow recovery has set in, fewer locals feel that they can afford cover charges or even tips, so clubs that used to have live music four or five nights a week have cut back to two or three.
 Conventions, typically a strong source of music gigs, are running at 70 percent of 2004 levels, but leisure travel remains far below pre-Katrina levels, according to the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. Over all, visitors generated $2.9 billion in spending in 2006, down from $4.9 billion in 2004, according to the bureau. About 3.7 million people visited the city in 2006, compared with more than 10 million in 2004.
 Compounding the music scene's slow revival is the challenge of tracking musicians -- who are typically paid in cash and often hold down other jobs -- in order to get them financial support. Habitat for Humanity, which is building what it describes as a ''musicians' village'' in the Ninth Ward, initially struggled to find creditworthy applicants -- just one instance of relief for artists failing to meet its mark. 
 ''It's kind of like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,'' says Roland von Kurnatowski, who owns Tipitina's with his wife, Mary. ''New Orleans musicians are unique and if you try to mess with what makes them unique too much, it's not a good thing. What they need is revenue opportunities.''
 Economic development leaders for the city and the state of Louisiana praise the efforts of Tipitina's at a time when governmental resources are strained. ''With the demise of the venues and the lack of tourism, we've got to find a way to get people back to work,'' says Lynn Ourso, executive director of the Louisiana Music Commission. ''They're putting these musicians to work on computers, showing how they can globally transmit and distribute -- they're teaching job skills.''
 MR. KURNATOWSKI, 56, is an unlikely anchor of the local music business. A New Orleans native and Tulane graduate, he says he had never heard of Tipitina's until he was asked to invest in the club in 1995. By then it was a beloved venue known for rollicking performances by locals like Dr. John and the Meters as well as touring acts like James Brown and Widespread Panic, but it had a spotty financial history. It was started by friends of the influential New Orleans pianist Professor Longhair as a place for him to play late in his career, but struggled under novice management and closed for a year in the mid-1980s.
 Mr. Kurnatowski, a real estate investor who owns about 35 apartment complexes in the Gulf Coast region, had begun marketing storage units in a converted hotel as rehearsal space and thought that having a connection with Tipitina's might lure musicians into renting. But the deteriorating club, facing new competition from the House of Blues, needed a new sound system and air-conditioning system. Mr. Kurnatowski agreed to make an equity investment; within a year he bought it outright for about $500,000. 
 He soon realized that he had neither the expertise nor the time to run Tipitina's properly -- especially because he was a morning person. ''It's a different routine,'' he says. ''It's working nights, and it just wasn't very practical.'' 
 Intrigued by the club's history and its intense following, he couldn't bring himself to sell it. He also says that his other real estate investments gave him enough financial breathing room to think creatively about what to do with Tipitina's. So, in 1997, he and his wife formed the Tipitina's Foundation, which would begin to use the club, still for-profit, to serve the nonprofit mission of helping musicians. The move provided a rationale for holding on to Tipitina's, even if it only broke even, and marked a return to the club's early purpose of supporting the local music scene.
 Its projects included an internship program for children wanting to get into the music business and a fund-raiser to buy instruments for local school bands. The first of its co-ops, a collaboration between the foundation and the city, opened in 2003. (Branches in Shreveport and Alexandria, La., opened later.) 
 The foundation could have easily fallen victim to Katrina's devastation. Many of the city's cultural organizations suffered extensive damage to facilities and had to cut their payrolls. Tipitina's suffered only limited wind damage, and the foundation's services were in demand. Many musicians lived in devastated neighborhoods like Gentilly and the Ninth Ward; those in other parts of town still lost instruments, amplifiers and CD collections to the flooding. Bands were scattered around the country, and some meager savings accounts were obliterated.
 After Katrina struck in August 2005, Mr. Kurnatowski and the executive director, Bill Taylor, decided to try to reconstitute the foundation's work. By late October, they had reopened the club and the co-op, both of which quickly became hubs of activity for musicians returning to town. A legal clinic that provided musicians with free help with contracts, copyright issues and licensing agreements became a popular service. 
 ''Even if they lost everything, they still had their intellectual property,'' says Ashlye M. Keaton, a lawyer who runs the clinic. ''You could see the look in people's eyes: 'This is all I have, this is my career, and I'm going to do everything I can to protect it.' ''
 For his part, Mr. Kurnatowski pledged to plow all profits from Tipitina's, which scaled back its staff and eliminated guaranteed payouts to musicians, into the foundation. The club has cut its number of shows to four nights a week from six, but has seen total attendance and bar sales stay steady. Even so, Mr. Kurnatowski says, Tipitina's operates on razor-thin margins: he says the club earned about $40,000 last year on revenue of about $500,000. 
 Other organizations also tried to put some financial muscle behind the local music business. The New Orleans Musicians Clinic paid musicians to play at the airport and offered $100 guarantees to musicians who could find gigs for themselves elsewhere. The Jazz Foundation of America also subsidized performances. The New Orleans Musician's Relief Fund, a charity started by the former dB's bassist Jeff Beninato, offered a temporary apartment to musicians. Renew Our Music, another relief fund, gave financial grants to musicians, while funds from Gibson Guitar and MusiCares, a charitable organization affiliated with the Recording Academy, helped buy scores of new instruments.
 For artists dependent on support, such backing was invaluable.
 Margie Perez, a former travel agent, had arrived in New Orleans just eight months before the storm. She returned to town in January 2006 to discover that her apartment in the Broadmoor neighborhood had been badly flooded. Determined to stay, she found other housing -- for twice what she paid pre-Katrina -- went to work cleaning damaged houses and started visiting the Tipitina's co-op. She picked up work in different bands and this last spring was invited to sing with the pianist and producer Allen Toussaint at Jazz Fest. 
 Ms. Perez, 42, also has a part-time job at a clothing boutique and is training to be a tour guide; the music business here is still too anemic for her to depend on it for her livelihood. ''You just get into as many projects as you can,'' Ms. Perez says. ''I'm in, like, five different bands and that's kind of the case with a lot of musicians in town.'' 
 Indeed, even as crowds come back, littering Bourbon Street with beer cans and daiquiri cups, musicians say they're not seeing their incomes rebound. Wil Kennedy, a guitarist and singer who plays for passers-by in Jackson Square, says the situation is still ''as bad as it was after 9/11,'' with his tips down as much as 75 percent from the peak period before 9/11. In the clubs, guarantees of a minimum payout are now less common; many clubs offer musicians just the take at the door or a percentage of drink sales. 
 ''They've kind of gotten used to getting the music cheap when people were so desperate they'd play for a sandwich and a $20 bill,'' says Kim Foreman, secretary and treasurer of a local branch of the American Federation of Musicians, which has lost about 120 of its 800 dues-paying members. Poverty keeps many musicians living with substandard housing and health care, Mr. Foreman says. 
 Katrina left as many as half of the city's roughly 5,000 working musicians marooned elsewhere, says Jordan Hirsch, executive director of Sweet Home New Orleans, an organization that provides financial support to musicians.
 ''A lot of people in Texas and Georgia and around the country want to be back, feel that their best economic opportunities are here, but just can't get from A to B,'' Mr. Hirsch says. 
 Others are scared off by the rampant crime and lack of basic services here, despite an economic need to be back in the Big Easy's cultural stew. ''Right now, New Orleans is not fit for my family,'' says the Hot 8 Brass Band trombonist Jerome Jones, who has relocated to Houston with his wife and four of his five children. Mr. Jones, whose bandmate Dinerral Shavers was murdered here last December, says he plans to commute to New Orleans for gigs and band business.
 IT'S an article of faith among New Orleanians that the music scene is an indelible part of the city's appeal. But the city and state historically haven't recognized the role that musicians and other creative workers play in driving tourism and improving the quality of life, advocates say. As a result, they say, the city and state have underinvested in the cultural sector of the economy. 
 ''People don't think of artists as a category of workers,'' says Maria-Rosario Jackson, director of the Urban Institute's Culture, Creativity, and Communities Program, which found that the city's infrastructure for ''cultural vitality'' even before Katrina rated in the bottom half of the country's metropolitan areas. 
 Figuring how ''to translate that authenticity to economic development has been the challenge for all these years,'' says Scott Aiges, who headed the city's music office before Katrina and is now director of marketing and communications for the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Foundation, which owns Jazz Fest. 
 Just weeks before the storm, Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu unveiled a new strategy for developing what was described as the ''cultural economy.'' Since then, the state has pushed through tax breaks for arts districts, musical and theatrical productions and sound recordings and made sure that events like Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest, which provide work for many musicians, survived. 
 But a separate individual tax break for artistic earnings failed in the State Legislature because of concerns that it wasn't fair to other working people, and other large-scale attempts have languished because of a lack of financing. In May 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, which was formed by Mayor C. Ray Nagin, recommended plowing $648 million into the cultural sector to create jobs, rebuild damaged facilities and open a national jazz center. But those ideas were shelved with the rest of the commission's work, and subsequent, scaled-back proposals still await financing. 
 New Orleans ''needs some anchors around which the economy can begin to rebuild, and arts and culture are an obvious one,'' says Holly Sidford, a principal at AEA Consulting in New York, which developed the recommendations for the commission's cultural subcommittee at the request of the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. ''But without investment, really deliberate and coherent investment, that won't happen.''
 Ernest Collins, the city's executive director for arts and entertainment, says of the commission's recommendations, which Mr. Nagin endorsed: ''That was a very large price tag. And needless to say, we don't have that money.'' 
 Leaders of nonprofit groups and organizations like Tipitina's say they are resigned to filling the void left by the public and private sectors as long as they can. Mr. Aiges, whose group owns Jazz Fest, is using receipts from the event to add new festivals, build an Internet-based system that will allow musicians to connect with talent coordinators and potential licensees, and put on a networking event for musicians during next year's festival. Sweet Home New Orleans is compiling the first database of local musicians, which should help it to distribute relief faster and more effectively, and hopes to get part-time work for them in other businesses.
 Next month, the Tipitina's Foundation will release a new CD honoring Fats Domino, with proceeds from it earmarked for resurrecting his music publishing company and opening a co-op near the singer's home in the Lower Ninth Ward. 
 But musicians say they wonder if New Orleans will ever nurture their careers the way it once did. The Hot 8 Brass Band, which was featured prominently in Spike Lee's documentary film ''When the Levees Broke,'' is concentrating on touring elsewhere in the United States and abroad -- even if that might mean missing Mardi Gras -- so it can play for outsiders. Outsiders, say band members, seem to value them more than their hometown.
 ''They make you feel how valuable you are to New Orleans,'' says Raymond Williams, a trumpeter for the band. ''I feel like maybe the city should treat musicians in the same way.''

HEADLINE: Opening the On-Ramp for Women

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KOTKIN

 BODY:
TWENTY-SOMETHING women have surged past young men on the salary scale in New York and other large cities, according to recent news reports. But these fast starters may find themselves blindsided as they progress into their 30s and 40s. Indeed, even though 59 percent of recent undergraduate degrees are held by women, more than 90 percent of the top earners at Fortune 500 companies are men. Sylvia Ann Hewlett has made it her mission to change that. 
 Dr. Hewlett, an economist, directs the gender and public policy program at Columbia University, where, she says, she was once turned down for tenure in the early 1980s because she allowed childbearing to ''dilute my focus.'' After writing several books about women and work, she returned to academia, then persuaded 34 companies employing 2.5 million people to participate in a ''Hidden Brain Drain'' task force. 
 ''Why is it,'' the task force asked, ''that after decades of creating opportunities for women and proactively nurturing diversity, companies are still struggling with the challenge of retaining and advancing women?'' Dr. Hewlett provides an answer in her new book, ''Off-Ramps and On-Ramps'' (Harvard Business School Press, $29.95).
 Women, Dr. Hewlett notes, not only shoulder different responsibilities at home but they also have subtler professional aspirations. Her achievement is to demonstrate that corporations, for the sake of their own bottom lines, should do more to accommodate women at the higher ranks.
 Dr. Hewlett helped sponsor scientific surveys that revealed that ''fully 60 percent of highly qualified women have nonlinear careers,'' in which they take a break for some scenic detours, she says. 
 The surveys show that while 45 percent of women who take an off-ramp from their careers face child-care challenges and another 24 percent have elder-care duties, almost one-third take a break solely because their partner's income is enough to support the household. Women use the off-ramp because they can. 
 These women still value the pressures and rewards of success, even if they do not value them exclusively. Their challenge becomes how to find an on-ramp back to the corporate world.
 Dr. Hewlett brings to bear a great deal of evidence to support her contention that professional women are held back by an outdated career model designed for white men with wives at home.
 Her calls for a rethinking have gained an audience in the corner office. White men are ''a segment of the talent pool that is shrinking,'' Jeremy Isaacs, chief executive for Europe and Asia at Lehman Brothers, tells her. In fact, the number of men with graduate degrees is projected to grow by just 1.3 percent over the next decade, compared with 16 percent for women, according to the Education Department. Small wonder that Mr. Isaacs says he ''would absolutely take three days a week of someone who is truly talented.'' 
 For an employer to allow flexibility, in other words, is not a luxury; it is necessary for marketplace survival. 
 Written as both advocacy and practical guide, the book offers suggestions to employers: establish a rich menu of flexible work and career arrangements, reimagine work-life issues (for example, offer benefits for elder care and not just child care), help women claim ambition, harness altruism and reduce stigma (even when flexible policies are in place, women do not always exercise them for fear of ending up on the mommy track). 
 Chapter after chapter illustrates how companies like Ernst & Young, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Time Warner, Johnson & Johnson and American Express are experimenting with these approaches. And through Dr. Hewlett's cross-company task force, they are sharing their successes. There's movement.
 No data are furnished on nonprofessional female workers or on how professional women treat their own employees, including nannies and housekeepers, many of whom would like flexible schedules -- not to mention working from home.
 Upbeat and earnest, Dr. Hewlett does manage some entertaining interludes, including the chapter on ''extreme jobs'' created by technology creep. Today, managers thumb their BlackBerrys to dispatch half-baked demands instantly and relentlessly. Extreme workers turn out to be predominantly men, leading sleepless, furniture-less lives -- and loving it.
 Dr. Hewlett notes that, according to the surveys, the percentage of women in banking and finance who had used an off-ramp, and who wanted to return to their former employers, was zero.
 Much of the problem is just blockhead management. For example, a woman identified only as Judith, who has three children, tells the author that ''it wasn't unusual for an e-mail to go out at 5:30 p.m. announcing a meeting at 7 p.m. -- which could drag on to 8:30.'' Predictably, ''very little was covered that could not have been dealt with by e-mail -- or in person the next morning.'' 
 Judith took a severance package and spent time with her children, then hungered to return to high-paying work. But with a gap in her resume, she remained unemployed.
 More deeply, flexibility meets resistance because it takes away an advantage that men have over women. In the surveys, almost half the professional women on the rise were childless. Men, of course, can marry late and still tap their reproductive potential. 
 Still, men come off as indispensable to female success. (Even elderly male bosses who father children Picasso-style can be helpful, she notes, as they discover the joys of some work-life balance.) And in a hierarchy, the C.E.O.'s stance on gender equity proves decisive. 
 Of course, some companies still continue shelling out tens of millions in sex discrimination suits and fritter away shareholder money by losing talented employees. 
 ''If a $2,000 desktop computer disappears from an employee's desk, I guarantee that there'll be an investigation,'' Maury Hanigan, a consultant, tells Dr. Hewlett, adding that ''if a $100,000-a-year executive with all kinds of client relationships'' quits ''to stay home with the kids -- there's no investigation.''

HEADLINE: A Bridge Collapses

 BODY:
The nation's physical foundations seem to be crumbling beneath us. Last week, a 40-year-old interstate highway bridge collapsed in Minneapolis, plunging rush-hour traffic into the Mississippi River 60 feet below. Two weeks earlier, an 83-year-old steam pipe under the streets of Manhattan exploded in a volcano-like blast, showering asbestos-laden debris. And two years before that, substandard levees gave way in New Orleans, opening the way for the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina. 
 These are some of the most dramatic signs of the nation's failure to maintain and enhance its aging physical structures at a time when demands on roads, transit systems, sewage treatment plants and other vital facilities are rising. In the event of a catastrophic failure, many lives can be lost. But even the slower deterioration undermines our quality of life and retards economic growth. Traffic jams waste gasoline, pollute the air and exhaust drivers' patience. Disabled trains and subways strand commuters. Gridlocked airports disrupt travel plans. And power failures plunge millions into darkness. 
 At a time of ballooning deficits, and in the midst of a hugely expensive war, most politicians will be tempted by the quick and inexpensive fix. But that is exactly how the country got into this problem. 
 How large a challenge the country is facing can be seen in a report by the American Society of Civil Engineers, grading the nation's infrastructure. The latest report, issued in 2005, assigned a cumulative grade of D, down from D+ four years earlier. Near-failing grades of D- applied to drinking water, sewage treatment and navigable waterways. The highest grade, C+, went for landfills and the recycling of solid waste.
 In between were unsafe dams, whose number was rising faster than they could be repaired; overstressed power lines, whose maintenance budgets had decreased for a decade; public parks and beaches that were falling into disrepair; and deteriorating schools that seemed unlikely to accommodate rising enrollments or allow smaller classes. 
 Bridges actually scored relatively well, earning a straight C, mostly because the percentage of the nation's 590,000 bridges that were rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete had dropped slightly, to 27 percent. The deficiency rating does not mean a bridge is in danger of collapse, but it does reflect the need for repairs, close monitoring and perhaps weight restrictions. 
 No one yet knows what caused the Minneapolis bridge, one of those deemed structurally deficient, to fall apart. Theories include undetected cracks or metal fatigue, vibrations from a resurfacing project on the roadway, or possibly soil erosion around the underwater supports. 
 The design of the structure was almost certainly an element. The 1,900-foot span lacked much redundancy for its critical supports, which could allow a single failure of a crucial structural part to bring down the whole edifice. The notion that critical parts ought to have backup systems seems so basic to current engineering practice that it is shocking to learn that some 756 bridges of similar design around the country also lack redundancy. They will need to be inspected and monitored with great care.
 Unfortunately, the adequacy of current inspections is also in question. It is disturbing that the pipe that burst in Manhattan had just been inspected and declared sound by a utility crew, that the levees in New Orleans had been regularly inspected by the Army Corps of Engineers, and that the Minneapolis bridge had been inspected annually.
 In these and other failures it will be important to establish whether the inspectors failed to do a diligent job or whether the real problem is that inspections are inherently limited in what they can detect. Perhaps inspectors need to be given much better sensing equipment to detect hidden flaws. 
 The larger problem of crumbling roads, bridges and levees and crashing electrical grids can almost always be traced to a lack of investment. When budgets are tight, elected officials find it convenient to cut back on maintenance and leave some future administration to deal with the consequences. When Congress appropriates money for public works, the legislators typically prefer shiny new projects that will enhance their reputations, not mere maintenance on a bridge named after someone else. The federal government has particularly lagged in paying for infrastructure projects, leaving state and local governments to assume the dominant role.
 Congress is now scrambling to provide extra money to help Minnesota replace its stricken bridge and is planning hearings on broader infrastructure needs. One sensible bill that ought to be quickly passed would set up a commission to assess the state of the nation's infrastructure, set priorities, and recommend financing approaches. Another bill is proposing a new national bank to leverage both public and private investment for repair and new construction projects. Each time there is one of these tragedies, politicians briefly declaim the need for a major and sustained investment in the nation's aging infrastructure. But that enthusiasm quickly flags. The collapse of Minneapolis's Bridge No. 9340 is a reminder that such long-postponed investments can no longer be neglected.

HEADLINE: Double Happiness

BYLINE: By Nicole Mones. 
Nicole Mones is the author of ''Lost in Translation'' and ''The Last Chinese Chef,'' published in May.

 BODY:
Why Chinese food in America is so unimaginative -- and let's be honest, generally so bad -- is a topic that bubbles to the surface every few years. Dutifully, food writers point out that real Chinese cooking is much more complex and delicious than anything you'll find here. Then, usually, nothing happens, and the conversation evaporates.
But never has there been so much potential for actual change. China's culinary renaissance, powered by its surging economy, would seem ideally poised to export real Chinese cooking. Recently, in an Op-Ed column in The Times, Nina and Tim Zagat, the founders of Zagat Survey, pleaded for more Chinese chefs to be allowed into America, so that we could finally have a chance to taste authentic Chinese cuisine. And several cookbook authors have been drawn to the subject: earlier this year, Fuchsia Dunlop published ''Revolutionary Chinese Cookbook,'' a primer on the cooking of Hunan (adapted in these pages). This fall, Cecilia Chiang, a pioneering San Francisco restaurateur, is coming out with ''The Seventh Daughter,'' a book about her family's cooking. 
 But the problem isn't one that a few books or even better immigration policy can fix. Real Chinese cooking doesn't need to be imported, because it has been here for decades. 
 Since the start of the current wave of Chinese immigration in the 1980s, gifted Chinese chefs have jammed into enclaves like the San Gabriel Valley in California and Flushing, N.Y., competing with one another, complaining about how hard it is to get Americans to give their cuisine a chance. The real problem is the American diner or, more precisely, the relationship between diner and chef. Chefs don't know how to step outside of all-Chinese communities and market their cuisine to the mainstream. And most American diners want to stick to the Chinese food they already know.
 The food they know is what chefs call Meiguorende kouwei -- food cooked ''to American taste.'' This cuisine uses a short vocabulary of standard sauces with big, pungent flavors. The sauce tends to lead, usually with a combination of flavor notes. As Linda Huang, owner of Chung King in San Gabriel, put it, ''It's sweet, sour and a little spicy.''
 The other food of China is Zhongguorende kouwei, food cooked ''to Chinese taste.'' That phrase covers a culinary tradition of enormous range and long history, with more than 5,000 named dishes. Each dish is individually conceived. Flavors vary from the delicate to the electric. At its highest levels, like any fine art, Chinese cuisine aims to resonate with the soul. A great menu has themes and a narrative arc. Dishes may evoke the natural world, aspects of civilization or the moods and phases of men's lives. 
 Finding this kind of cooking in America doesn't require insider knowledge. All it takes is will and persistence. When you go to better Chinese restaurants, ask for the best ''Chinese taste'' dishes on (or off) the menu, and refuse to budge until you get them.
 Or better yet, make a change in your own home by experiencing the difference between ''American taste'' and ''Chinese taste'' cooking. Try preparing chicken two ways. Lemon chicken combines crisp, sweet and sour into a deliriously decadent wallop in classic American style. Compare it with the Chinese-style drunken chicken, a make-ahead cold dish in which the object is putting two principal flavors, chicken and wine, into perfect balance.
 Clams in black-bean sauce is another American mainstay: bright, piquant, boasting more loudly of its flavorings than of its clams. Steamed clams and eggs reverses the emphasis. The clam comes first, releasing its subtle marine flavor through the savory steamed egg. Discovering the baby clams at the bottom in their little bath of broth is the dish's final delight. 
 Steamed Clams and Eggs
 12 Manila clams, scrubbed
 4 eggs
 2/3 cup unsalted chicken broth
 Salt 
 Freshly ground white pepper
 Sesame oil
 Light soy sauce
 1 tablespoon minced scallion.
 1. In a large pot fitted with a steamer rack large enough to hold 4 (8-ounce) ramekins, bring a quart of water to a boil. Divide clams among ramekins. 
 2. In a small bowl whisk 1 egg until frothy. Whisk in an equivalent amount of chicken broth and a dash of salt and white pepper. Pour the egg mixture over the clams in one of the ramekins. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Place ramekins on the steamer rack in the pot. 
 3. Cover the pot and simmer for 12 minutes. Remove ramekins. Garnish each with a small drop of sesame oil, a few drops of soy sauce and a sprinkle of scallions. Serves 4 as an appetizer. Adapted from Wang Haibo, the chef and owner of Green Village in San Gabriel, Calif.
 Clams in Black-Bean Sauce
 1 teaspoon cornstarch
 tablespoons salted black beans
 2 tablespoons peanut oil
 3 garlic cloves, minced
 2 scallions, finely chopped
 2 tablespoons minced ginger 
 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes 
 2 pounds Manila or littleneck clams, scrubbed and dried
 3 tablespoons Shaoshing wine or dry sherry
 * cup unsalted chicken broth
 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro.
 1. Dissolve cornstarch in 1 tablespoon warm water and set aside. Soak the salted beans in 1/2 cup warm water for 10 minutes. Drain, and mash coarsely with a fork.
 2. Set a wok over high heat and pour in the oil. Add the garlic, scallions and ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the beans and red-pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Drop in the clams and stir-fry for 30 seconds, then pour in the wine and broth. Reduce heat to medium and cook, covered, until most of the clams have opened, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cornstarch mixture and raise heat to high. Stir and cook, uncovered, until the sauce adheres to the clams, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in the cilantro. Serves 4. Adapted from the author's husband, Paul Mones.
 Lemon Chicken
 For the chicken:
 3 8-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breasts halves
 2 eggs
 1 1/2 cups potato flour 
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
 1 1/2-2 cups peanut oil
 For the sauce: 
 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
 1 teaspoon lemon zest
 1/2 cup sugar
 1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1 heaping tablespoon cornstarch.
 1. Butterfly the chicken breasts, then slice them lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick strips. Cut the strips in half, place in a bowl and refrigerate.
 2. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs until smooth. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of the potato flour. Mix in the baking soda and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Place the remaining potato flour in a bowl, season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and set aside.
 3. Prepare the sauce: Combine the lemon juice and zest, sugar, vinegar, salt and 3/4 cup water in a saucepan and place over medium heat. In a bowl, stir together 1/2 cup of the sauce and the cornstarch. Transfer this mixture back to the pan. Simmer for 15 minutes. 
 4. Place a wok over medium-high heat and add the oil. Working in batches, cook the chicken: dredge a small portion of chicken in the egg mixture. Shake off excess egg from the chicken and coat it in the seasoned potato flour. Shake again. Lower the chicken into the hot oil one piece at a time. Cook until crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Arrange chicken in a shallow bowl. Reheat the sauce and pour it over the chicken. Serves 4. Adapted from Paul Mones. A recipe for ''Chinese taste'' drunken chicken can be found at nytimes.com/magazine.

HEADLINE: Cargo Ships Leaving Red Hook? Maybe Not So Fast

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
The scene at the Red Hook piers in Brooklyn on Friday morning was a standoff between grit and glitz.
 On Pier 10, at Brooklyn's last remaining cargo terminal, longshoremen hoisted freight containers off the backs of flatbed trucks lined up like roller-coaster cars and set them down on the deck of a mammoth freighter. Across an inlet on Pier 12, a different sort of seagoing colossus awaited: the Queen Mary 2, the biggest passenger liner ever built, just in from Southampton, England, with its payload of more than 2,000 vacationers.
 For five years, the Bloomberg administration has seen the cruise terminal as emblematic of Red Hook's future and the shipping operation as a relic, destined to give way to a tourist-friendly complex of more cruise ship terminals, shops and hotels, with condominiums nearby.
 But after a five-year uphill struggle to transform the Red Hook waterfront, the city appears to be concluding that, for now, anyway, its future lies in its industrial past. 
 In recent weeks, city officials have publicly backed off plans to build a second cruise terminal and expressed interest in keeping the container port. 
 A City Council resolution introduced late last month, if passed, would effectively warn the Bloomberg administration of the Council's intention to preserve the container port by holding up a proposed rezoning of the piers. 
 The Council also has the power to block the transfer of the piers from their owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, to the city, a step that would be necessary for a major redevelopment.
 And this month, officials from the city's Economic Development Corporation and from the Port Authority will meet with the cargo port's operator, American Stevedoring Inc. The company is operating without a lease, and the Port Authority has for years routinely denied its requests for lease extensions.
 Although none of the players would speak about the agenda, American Stevedoring said the meeting was the first in at least three years that the city and the Port Authority have agreed to hold with company officials. 
 ''In the context of what's been happening in the last five years,'' Matt Yates, a spokesman for American Stevedoring, said on Friday, ''the up-and-downs and the tug of wars, things are great at the Brooklyn port, and we're poised for success.''
 Although the city has yet to take any direct action, even its comments signal a significant change of course from as recently as last fall, when the city unveiled a map for the Red Hook waterfront's future showing a beer garden, a marina, art galleries and a second cruise terminal. The cargo terminal was still in the plan, but was shrunk to two piers from five, which supporters of the terminal said was too small to be viable.
 City Councilman David Yassky, one of the shipping terminal's most vocal defenders and the sponsor of the recent resolution, said that in a meeting with him last month, officials from the Economic Development Corporation were ''sounding absolutely on target.'' The officials, Mr. Yassky said, were saying, ''We see shipping as a real opportunity for growth on the waterfront, and we want to make that happen.'' 
 In an interview with The New York Observer on July 10, the development corporation's new official in charge of Red Hook, Madelyn Wils, said that the city saw ''no imminent need for another cruise ship terminal'' and was ''looking at putting out an R.F.E.I. for a container port,'' referring to a request for expressions of interest from potential operators.
 Since then, the Bloomberg administration has issued only boilerplate, noncommittal statements on the subject. A spokeswoman for the development corporation, Janel Patterson, said on Friday, ''We continue to work with the Port Authority to plan for the future of the entire waterfront, including Piers 7 through 12, with a focus as always on striking a balance between job creation, waterfront access and preserving Red Hook's waterfront character.''
 The Port Authority, which for years has tried to move cargo operations from Red Hook to its much bigger ports in New Jersey and on Staten Island, said it awaited the city's next move. ''Obviously, it's their decision as to what they want there, and how they want to proceed with whatever plan they want to come up with,'' said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the agency.
 The word bandied about most often by supporters of the shipping terminal is jobs. Depending on whether the city or American Stevedoring is doing the estimating, the shipping operation in Red Hook, a curving spit of land jutting into the harbor south of the Brooklyn Bridge, employs between 400 and 700 people altogether, mostly in the kinds of high-paying blue-collar jobs that are vanishing from the city.
 The cruise terminal, which opened with fanfare in the spring of 2006, was projected by the city to create upward of 500 jobs. As of last week, Ms. Patterson said, it employed 14 people full time. An additional 279 people pick up a day's work when a cruise ship comes in, an average of once a week, she said.
 But jobs are only a part of the debate and a sort of proxy for a host of other issues: neighborhood character and New York's eternal rivalry with New Jersey among them. In any case, the administration has not been able to sustain much support, either from other politicians with clout or from the public, to move forward with its vision.
 Even the shipping terminal's supporters agree that the terminal should eventually move out of Red Hook, which lacks storage space for containers and easy highway and rail access. A much larger and long-vacant terminal a couple of miles down the waterfront in Sunset Park is seen as the most logical spot for a bigger operation.
 But officials like Mr. Yassky and Representative Jerrold Nadler have insisted for years that if the city closed the Red Hook port before opening its replacement, shippers would take their business elsewhere. The terminal's murky future has already scared away some potential customers. In 2005, a German cargo company backed out of a deal to bring about 60,000 freight containers a year to Red Hook because, the company told reporters at the time, the city would not guarantee that the terminal would stay the same size through 2009.
 Ms. Wils's recent statements about keeping the cargo terminal in Red Hook but soliciting bids to run it from vendors other than American Stevedoring were met with considerable wariness on the same grounds. The bid process, Mr. Yassky said, ''would just add to this years-long period of uncertainty about the waterfront.'' He added, ''The danger is this uncertainty is deadly in the marketplace.''
 But a government official familiar with the situation concerning the pier battle, who spoke anonymously for fear of disturbing a delicate detente, interpreted the coming meeting with American Stevedoring as a sign that the city is ready to help the company strike a deal with the Port Authority.

WILDWOOD
 THERE is a certain je ne sais quoi in the air at the Wildwood beach again this summer, thanks to the return, after an absence of more than two decades, of large numbers of sun-loving tourists from Quebec. 
 Among those basking in the warmth and sea breezes last month were Steve Mallet, 46, and his wife, Chantal Charbonneau, 45, of Lacolle, Quebec, who were reliving 30-year-old memories of eating pizza on the boardwalk outside Morey's Pier. But this time their 13-year-old daughter Melissa was with them, her sunburned face shaded by a pink ''Wildwoods'' baseball cap. 
 Their reason for making the eight-hour-plus drive south this year was the same voiced by many French Canadian visitors. 
 ''A year ago our dollar was worth 30 percent less than the U.S. dollar,'' said Mr. Mallet, a caterer who was able to book a room here at the Royal Canadian hotel with just three days' notice. ''Now it's 94 cents.''
 He last vacationed in Wildwood when he was 15.
 Tourism officials and hotel owners in this Cape May County resort began noticing an increase in the number of French Canadian visitors in the summer of 2005, after a prolonged scarcity caused by a weak Canadian dollar and high unemployment in Quebec. 
 Quebecois had been devoted fans of the Wildwoods since the 1960s, when an aggressive marketing campaign lured them with affordably priced motel rooms; wide, free beaches; warm waters; and a lively, family-oriented boardwalk scene.
 The New England coast, especially places like Old Orchard Beach and Ogunquit in Maine, had traditionally been a summer vacation destination for French Canadians. But the ocean there was notoriously frigid, a fact Wildwood boosters seized upon as incentive for Canadians to keep driving south. 
 ''The '70s were the heyday, when 25 percent of our visitors were Canadian,'' said Diane F. Wieland, director of the Cape May County Department of Tourism. 
 But the plummeting Canadian dollar took its toll, and by the mid-90s, when it was worth only about 65 cents in the United States, just 5 percent of visitors to Cape May County were French Canadian, she said. The county closed its Montreal tourism office, which had been in operation for 25 years, in 1995. 
 Last summer, however, 15 percent of Cape May County's 19 million visitors were Canadian, Ms. Wieland said. Most stayed on the five-mile-long barrier island known as the Wildwoods, which includes the cities of North Wildwood and Wildwood and the borough of Wildwood Crest.
 ''We think that will grow,'' Ms. Wieland said. ''We're seeing a lot of baby boomers with their kids, people in their 40s who remember coming here as kids.'' 
 Wildwood has also increased its advertising spending in Quebec, to $60,000 this year from $20,000 in 2006, with ads in Le Journal de Montreal and La Presse. John Siciliano, executive director of the Greater Wildwoods Tourism Improvement and Development Authority, said Canada was the only location outside the United States where the resort is marketed. 
 Although signs in French are few and far between, Wildwood's French Canadian connection is evident in the names of some of its doo-wop-era motels, including the Fleur de Lis, the Royal Canadian and the Quebec by-the-Sea. 
 At the Royal Canadian, the owner, Maria Tenaglia, said that French Canadians had made about 30 percent of her bookings for this July and August, and that one week in July, 50 of the motel's 86 rooms were inhabited by French Canadians. They tend to book longer stays of a week to two weeks, she said, and are the first to hit the beach in the morning. 
 ''The first thing they ask when they call is, 'How warm is the ocean?' '' she said. 
 Although the Wildwoods are more affordable than many other Jersey Shore towns, many hoteliers said French Canadians request rooms with kitchen facilities. Even with the more favorable exchange rate, cooking in the room can save hundreds of dollars in restaurant tabs.
 Louise Desrosiers, 48, a day care center owner from Rigaud, Quebec, said last month that she was spending her week's vacation shuttling between the beach and cooking in the room she shared at the Royal Canadian with her brother, Sylvain, and his four children, who range in age from 6 to 14.
 She visited Wildwood as a teenager and again for five years in the late 1980s when her son was little. ''It hasn't changed that much,'' Ms. Desrosiers said, ''except the prices went up.'' 
 But for some, prices -- even a highly unfavorable exchange rate -- simply did not matter. One sultry day last month, six families sat together on the beach in front of the Matador motel in North Wildwood with coolers full of Molson Dry and Bud Light. A blue-and-white Quebec umbrella fluttered in the breeze as the sunbathers popped open cans of beer and soda and chatted in French. 
 Daniel Grenier, 48, of Montreal, said members of the group had been going to Wildwood together every summer for decades, without regard to the exchange rate. The kids love the boardwalk amusement rides, he said, and everyone loves the temperature of the Atlantic at this latitude. 
 ''Old Orchard Beach?'' he grumbled. ''The water's so cold over there!'' 
 Relaxing at the Quebec by-the-Sea's hotel's pool on her last day of vacation before heading back to the Montreal suburb of Terrebonne, Franca Cuffaro, 38, said the exchange rate had not kept her away, either. Instead, her former job in a garden supply store had prevented her from taking a summer vacation at all for the last 15 years. With a new job, she and her husband, Domenic, decided to make the drive down last month. 
 ''We'll be back, for sure,'' she said. ''Hopefully it won't take us another 15 years.''

HEADLINE: Spectacle For the Heart And Soul

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
GLOVER, Vt.
 FOR the first time in many summers the Bread and Puppet Theater will travel nine hours from northern Vermont for a New York City gig, at Lincoln Center on Wednesday evening. Then the troupe will turn around and ride back to its farm just below the Canadian border, where it will put on the same show. You can easily spot the group en route: 1963 school bus, painted sky blue, with a mountain landscape, an angel and a beaming sun on the side. 
 People who know of the troupe without really knowing its work tend to link it to political street theater of the 1960s, an accurate but incomplete association. Recently I've been thinking of the theater in a contemporary context. At a time when the art industry is awash in cash and privilege, and theater tickets routinely go for $100 or more, Bread and Puppet continues, more than 40 years on, to live an ideal of art as collective enterprise, a free or low-cost alternative voice outside the profit system. 
 I have another association with the troupe: Bread and Puppet gave me the single most beautiful sight I've ever seen in a theater. That was in 1982, in the sloping, wide-open field that is part of the theater's farm in Glover, Vt. There the collective was presenting a two-day festival, Our Domestic Resurrection Circus, as it had done almost every summer since relocating from the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the early 1970s.
 The circus, a bunch of political skits, concerts and vaudeville acts, took place in the afternoon, and it was fun. (The troupe's Lincoln Center appearance will follow more or less this format, on a smaller scale.) Then at sunset came the pageant, a kind of morality play told in epic visual terms. During Vietnam the themes had been specific. Wrongs had a name and a solution: Stop the war. By the 1980s the issues had become many and complicated -- threatened nature, global consumerism, nuclear dangers -- and remedies far less sure. The 1982 pageant had an odd tone, brusque and apocalyptic. It opened with a bucolic scene: little cutout houses and trees carried onto the field, followed by puppets of dancing cows. Villagers in masks arrived, milked the cows, settled down to bed, woke up, had children who within minutes had children of their own. This was ordinary life set to haunting music: vigorous, low-church American folk hymns from the 19th-century collection ''The Sacred Harp.''
 Suddenly four dark puppet horses with devil riders wheeled in from afar, backed by a huge dragon. Almost without warning the devils waved black banners over the villagers, who fell to the ground, dead. The devils then piled the houses and horses together and set them alight. Good and evil alike were in flames. Moral chaos. End of story. 
 But not quite. As the fire burned, a half-dozen great white gulls or cranes -- muslin kites carried on sticks by runners -- soared up from the horizon and started flying in our direction. They came right to the flames and soared over them as if looking for signs of life. Then they circled back across the field, melting into darkness. It was fantastic. Only when they were out of sight did I see that night had fallen and stars were out. It felt like an impossible trick of stagecraft, a miracle. I had been simultaneously transported and pulled back to earth.
 Last month, on a cool, rainy midweek day, I was back in that field, standing on the same hill, looking at the same horizon. Nothing had changed, but there is no pageant this summer. There hasn't been since 1998, when a man at the festival was killed during an alcohol-fueled fight. By that time the two-day event had become a mini-Woodstock, attracting some 30,000 people who camped out in the surrounding countryside, overwhelming the resources of the theater and surrounding towns.
 The result was that Bread and Puppet declared Our Domestic Resurrection Circus over. For good.
 The theater itself, however, is still in residence on the farm and very much in business. It maintains an extraordinary archival museum of puppets and masks in a 19th-century barn -- open every day, admission free -- and produces hand-colored posters, banners and books, a main source of Bread and Puppet income. 
 If anything, the troupe is performing more than ever. It tours regularly, often to colleges, which pay to have Bread and Puppet entertain and inspire students. And the troupe presents free circuses and pageants at the farm, on a small scale, to audiences of 100 to 200 people on summer weekends. 
 Traditionally the troupe has consisted of a handful of resident performers; as of July there were four paid by the month and a business manager paid by the hour. And the group has always depended heavily on volunteers, either performers familiar with the troupe's work or people trained more or less on the spot. This is still true. This summer the company includes a dozen or so resident interns who live in the original farmhouse or in nearby tents, sharing a communal kitchen, outhouses and a single house phone. (Glover is in a no-cellphone zone.) Most have art backgrounds, though that is not a requirement. A few are art activists. Several of them will be coming to New York. 
 New York City is where Bread and Puppet started. And when I say Bread and Puppet, I am primarily speaking of Peter Schumann, who founded the theater and continues to shape it. He was born in Silesia, now part of Poland, in 1934, the son of a Lutheran schoolmaster. During World War II the family fled to northern Germany, where, as refugees, they lived on scraps gleaned from local farms. The bread that Mr. Schumann bakes daily for the theater artists and for distribution to audiences after performances is made from the same kind of coarse, hand-ground rye his mother used at that time. 
 As a child Mr. Schumann learned to make masks and puppets at home; as a young adult he became interested in sculpture and dance. In 1959 he formed an itinerant dance group in Germany. He had also married an American, Elka Leigh Scott, and started a family, eventually having five children. In 1961 they moved to the United States, living first in Connecticut, then settling on the Lower East Side. 
 It was an exciting moment. The city was electric with new music, dance, art and theater, which combined in the work of people like John Cage and Merce Cunningham and in the Happenings organized by Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg and others.
 These artists inspired Mr. Schumann and helped clarify what he wanted to do: create a collaborative theater open to untrained participants. Performing and teaching would have equal importance, and the ideal audience would be neighbors, passers-by, strangers. The theater would have the gravity of ritual, the raucous humor of carnival and eyes and ears tuned to the news of the day. 
 In 1962 he created his first masked dance, and in the same year he took up puppetry again. He founded Bread and Puppet Theater in 1963. Mr. Schumann's politics were communitarian and pacifist, and some of the troupe's first performances were street parades, using puppets and masks to support rent strikes in economically vulnerable communities. For marches against the Vietnam War he made wearable, life-size puppets, the heads created from clay molds he made himself. Now artifacts of the theater's history, they are his most striking and durable visual creations. 
 And the only place to get a sense of their imaginative range is in the museum at the Vermont farm. 
 When I first visited on the festival weekend in 1982, Bread and Puppet occupied one floor of the barn; now it is on two, and it is doubly astounding. Last month, with the Schumanns and the interns busy, I had the place to myself. 
 The barn's ground floor is divided into three parallel corridors, once lined with stalls but now divided into alcoves holding figures and props from hundreds of past performances. The objects are vivid, but made of cheap materials and worn from use. Mr. Schumann calls the barn the museum for the Art of Impermanence. 
 Yet it is hard to imagine a more quickening sight than the installation on the barn's high-ceilinged upper floor. All of Mr. Schumann's largest puppets are here: immense pageant gods, madonnas and angels; giant butchers and salesmen; washerwomen in kerchiefs and skirts; Yama, the King of Hell, sprouting heads like cancers. Visually it is a coup de theatre; conceptually it is intricate moral and narrative cosmology. If any single work could effectively fill the atrium space at the Museum of Modern Art, this ensemble could, and should.
 For a brief time, in late spring of 1982, the barn was practically empty. That was the year that Bread and Puppet led the nuclear freeze parade in New York City during United Nations sessions on disarmament. Mr. Schumann brought some 250 masks and puppets from Vermont, rounded up and trained thousands of volunteers, and in just a few days organized one of the most spectacular pieces of public theater the city has ever seen. 
 Titled ''The Fight Against the End of the World,'' it was an epic in three stages that included figures with stars for heads, crimson-and-black imps swarming around a figure of death on a skeletal horse, and a tableau of white birds and a blue ark in full sail. In the midst of it Mr. Schumann himself appeared in a red-white-and-blue Uncle Sam outfit, perched atop sky-high stilts, dancing to a ragtime tune.
 Hundreds of thousands of people lined Fifth Avenue, rapt, quietly beaming; many wiped their eyes. They had been given a gift, an image of affirmation on a tremendous scale.
 But as was true of the Glover pageant later that summer, affirmation in Mr. Schumann's work is always provisional, shadowed by the darkness that proceeds it. This has seemed more true over the years, perhaps as he has seen new generations of Americans retreat from an awareness of political urgency. Working in unreceptive times has made Bread and Puppet's art tough even when sweet; emotionally severe even at its most beautiful. 
 For me the real affirmation of the disarmament pageant lay less in the fact that Mr. Schumann came to New York and created this hugely ambitious collective work of art than in the fact that immediately afterward he returned to Vermont, to a farm, to a barn, to the outdoor baking oven, to his workshops and to his own work, which has come to include an increasing amount of painting, most of which stays out of the art world's sight. 
 And although he is personally a star -- the theater historian Stefan Brecht calls him, with cause, one of the great artists of the 20th century -- Mr. Schumann has kept faith with the redemptive politics of the everyday, of shared ordinariness. 
 I thought of this near the end of my stay at the farm last month. The theater does a lot of community outreach. That evening it was scheduled to give one-night workshops for around 50 Vermont high school students. They were all seniors in the Upward Bound program, established by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s to support students who would be the first members of their families to attend college. 
 In the past, I was told, some students took the visit as a night off, a chance to hang out and horse around. So I wasn't expecting much when the vans arrived and the kids split into groups, one going to the print shop, another to a stilt-walking session, another to the farmhouse for a sing, with all the groups rotating, so each student was able to be in every session. 
 I wandered back to the barn, upstairs to where a puppet called Angel of the Earth stands, two stories tall and impassively protective, over the more than 40 years of Bread and Puppet history: one of the great sights of American art. I heard a ragtime tune outside; that would be Mr. Schumann teaching the kids to strut and dance on stilts. Then I heard the most beautiful music on earth. Choral singing. 
 I followed it, out of the barn, into the farmhouse and upstairs, to where Elka Schumann had just finished one singing workshop and was introducing a fresh batch of students to a ''Sacred Harp'' hymn.
 The original melody came from England to America in the 18th century, she said. Then, as Americans developed a taste for more elite and refined culture, these hymns, written in a four-note style that anyone could learn, sounded rough and crude. So they passed from city to country, from the north to the south, where they became a pretext for community sings. Let's try one, she said. The students shifted in their seats but sang the words with her:
 And every man neath his vine and fig tree
 Shall live in peace and unafraid.
 And into ploughshares beat their swords.
 Nations shall have war no more.
 Then they sang them again, more confidently. By the third time they sounded like angels.

HEADLINE: Sterling's Promise Tarnished Quickly

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
WHAT WAS IT? The Sterling 825 and 827 of 1987-90 were midrange luxury sedans (and four-door hatchbacks) mechanically similar to the Acura Legend. 
 AND THE POINT WAS? Progeny of a Honda-Rover joint venture, the Sterling never lived up to its promise: a melding of Japanese practicality and Savile Row elegance. The Sterling borrowed the platform and engines of the Legend, but was built by the Rover Group in Britain. Rover created the Sterling brand to market the fruit of its collaboration with Honda. 
 REALITY CHECK The car might have turned out all right if the infusion of British style had taken place in Japan. But in the 1980s, quality control was still very much an alien concept to the British auto industry. The Sterling suffered from the usual British car maladies: electrical problems, poor materials and shoddy assembly. 
 But before these problems became common knowledge -- Sterling was a bottom dweller in the early J. D. Power & Associates quality surveys -- the Sterling sold reasonably well. More than 15,000 cars found American buyers in the first year. 
 By 1991, sales sank to around 4,000 despite rebates of $6,000, which may well have been the largest offered up to then (nearly $10,000 in 2007 dollars). By 1992, Acura was flourishing and Sterling was dead. 
 THE ADS SAID Marketers promoted the Sterling Plus motor club, which provided road service and hotel accommodations for stranded owners. In the five years it sold cars in the United States, Sterling may have rivaled Caesars Palace in giving away hotel rooms.
 THE CRITICS SAID Car, a British magazine, called the Sterling the ''Bland Rover'' because of its weak 2.5-liter Honda V-6 (replaced by a 2.7-liter V-6 in 1989). ROB SASS

HEADLINE: Trading Places: Red Sox Have Become the Yankees

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Name that team: 
 It signed a bunch of expensive free agents last winter.
 It is accustomed to leading its division.
 Last week, as the trading deadline approached, it spent some more money and traded a bright young pitcher to fortify a position where it already had a couple of All-Stars.
 If you guessed the Yankees -- and why wouldn't you? -- you lose. The answer is the Boston Red Sox, who this season are doing a terrific imitation of the Yankees, the team they have long maligned for doing precisely what the Red Sox have done since the end of last season. This falls into the category known as if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
 By acquiring Eric Gagne last week, the Red Sox forfeited their right to criticize or whine about the Yankees, their longtime archenemy and nemesis, the team their chief executive once called the Evil Empire. This year, there's a new show in town, and the Red Sox have cast themselves as the Yankees. As such, they are giving an award-winning performance, which is not to say there's anything wrong with what they're doing. 
 The Gagne acquisition was the perfect touch. The Red Sox already had the American League's best bullpen, an aggregation that going into the weekend boasted a 2.73 earned run average and a .223 opponents' batting average -- each a league best. They had Jonathan Papelbon with a 2.09 E.R.A. and 24 saves, and they had Hideki Okajima with a minuscule 1.01 E.R.A. 
 But the Texas Rangers made Gagne available because they were going nowhere and he was going to be a free agent after the season. The Red Sox had two reasons to add him to their bullpen: They had discarded two relievers they signed last winter as free agents -- J. C. Romero and Joel Pineiro -- because they hadn't performed as expected, and the Yankees had also expressed interest in Gagne.
 The Red Sox were so eager to get Gagne, the reconstructed right-hander, that they agreed to pay $2.8 million of the $3.85 million it took to get Gagne to waive the no-trade clause in his contract and to include in the package a 25-year-old left-handed pitcher, Kason Gabbard, who had a 4-0 record for Boston in seven starts this season. 
 The Red Sox' willingness to take those steps had Yankees written all over it. The Yankees, in the past, have spent money and sacrificed good young players to get established players.
 Despite Boston's aggressive stance, the Yankees could have obtained Gagne for themselves, but they were uncharacteristically unwilling to pay the price. The Rangers wanted Melky Cabrera, the Yankees' impressive young outfielder, or one of the Yankees' top three minor league pitching prospects -- Phil Hughes, Joba Chamberlain or Ian Kennedy. 
 Even knowing that the Red Sox would get Gagne if they didn't make the deal and knowing their bullpen needed help, the Yankees said no. Money was no object, but they refused to trade a good young player. How times have changed. 
 In taking on the Yankees' previous role, the Red Sox are taking advantage of a change in the Yankees' baseball operation. General Manager Brian Cashman runs it. The principal owner, George Steinbrenner, in questionable health, has ceded that authority to Cashman after years of trading away good young prospects for veterans.
 In getting Gagne, the Red Sox made their most striking deadline acquisition since they obtained Orlando Cabrera, Doug Mientkiewicz and Dave Roberts in 2004. Cabrera and Mientkiewicz gave the Red Sox' infield needed stability, and Roberts gave them the stolen base in the playoffs against the Yankees that triggered the improbable run of seven consecutive postseason wins to the World Series championship.
 Having failed to reach the playoffs last year for the first time in four years, the Red Sox were determined not to let it happen again. Neither economics nor geography would deter them. 
 They recruited Daisuke Matsuzaka and Okajima from Japan and signed J. D. Drew, Julio Lugo, Pineiro and Romero as free agents. Except for the Japanese contingent, the signings have not turned into some of the best ever. Drew and Lugo have been offensive disappointments, and the relievers are gone.
 In the best tradition of the Yankees, the Red Sox acquired Gagne to make up for the failure of Pineiro and Romero. They also tried, unsuccessfully, to get Jermaine Dye from the Chicago White Sox to provide the punch that Drew hasn't given them.
 The Yankees have long disturbed other clubs not only by their initial free-agent spending but also by their ability and willingness to spend more to rectify their mistakes. Now it's the Red Sox who are doing that very thing.
 John Henry, the Red Sox' principal owner, and Larry Lucchino, the chief executive, rejected the notion that they were copying the Yankees. 
 ''This was a trade we felt could significantly improve our chances if we make the postseason,'' Henry said in an e-mail message. 
 Lucchino noted that the Yankees weren't the only team that made deadline deals.
 ''Lots of teams go out in the month of July and try to acquire short-term help,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It's not uncommon to trade younger players for a more established player. On July 31, virtually all deals fit that situation.''
 Asked about adding Gagne to the league's best bullpen, Lucchino said: ''That's a debatable point. We had a good bullpen, but we had issues we were concerned about. The vagaries of baseball are such that you never have enough pitching. It's a cliche, but we live by it.''
 Like Henry, Lucchino said he was concerned about the Yankees. ''I'm always concerned about a team with the strength and depth and resources of the Yankees,'' he said. ''Before the season ends, the Yankees will continue to be a team to be reckoned with.''
 But as he always does in his assessment of the division, Lucchino added: ''We do not think it's fair or appropriate to lump us with the Yankees. They are a team and market different from the rest of baseball.''
 He didn't cite any figures, but Lucchino would be happy to have it pointed out that the Red Sox' current payroll is $148.6 million, the Yankees' $215.2 million. 
 Managers' Surprising Moves
 There's nothing unusual about three or four managerial changes by this stage of the season, but what is unusual is that as many managers have voluntarily relinquished their jobs as have departed involuntarily. 
 Buddy Bell of Kansas City hasn't gone anywhere, but he announced last week that he would leave the job at the end of the season and join the Royals' front office. Five weeks ago, Mike Hargrove resigned from the Seattle job. 
 The coincidence of the actions of Hargrove and Bell was that they made their decisions at a time when their teams were improving. The Mariners were becoming a legitimate contender in the American League West, and the Royals were threatening to get out of last place in the A.L. Central, their place of residence the last three seasons and virtually all of this season.
 Balance of Trade Shifts
 On May 26, Brian Bannister made his sixth start for the Royals and incurred his third loss. He had no victories and a 4.54 earned run average. That night, Ambiorix Burgos made his 17th relief appearance for the Mets and allowed Florida no runs in two innings, lowering his E.R.A. to 3.42.
 Four days later, Burgos, who was traded for Bannister, was optioned to the minor leagues, where he remains. The next day, June 1, Bannister made his seventh start and began an impressive stretch that continues today. 
 In his last 11 starts, the 26-year-old Bannister, a right-hander, has compiled a 7-3 record and a 2.95 earned run average. His performance has mirrored the Royals' rise from the depths of the A.L. Central. Before June 1, they had a 19-35 record. Since then, their record is 29-25. 
 Franco Still Setting Records
 In the second inning of the Mets' game against Arizona on May 4, Julio Franco became the oldest player to hit a home run in the majors. He was 48 years 8 months 12 days old. In the ninth inning of that game, he became the oldest player to hit a home run and steal a base in the same game. On June 4, he became the oldest player to have more than one stolen base in a season. 
 Last Wednesday, Franco became the oldest player to be designated for assignment twice in the same season. The Mets designated him July 12, then released him July 18, and the Atlanta Braves instantly signed him. He played 11 games with the Braves before they acquired Mark Teixeira and needed a roster spot for him. 
 In all this season, Franco, who wants to play in the majors at the age of 50, batted .221 (19 for 86) in 51 games, 40 for the Mets. He will celebrate his 49th birthday Aug. 23.
 A Typical Response
 What should Bob Costas say to Barry Bonds in response to Bonds's reaction to a Costas interview of a steroids creator who implicated Bonds in steroids use? ''Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.''
 Bonds called Costas ''a little midget man'' who doesn't know anything about baseball, and said he ''never played the game before.''
 In one sentence, Bonds invoked probably the three most often used comebacks to someone who says something a player doesn't like. He cites the person's size (if he's not as big as the player), he questions what the news media person knows about the sport the player plays, and he rejects the comments because the person never played the game, which automatically disqualifies him from making comments. 
 Bonds did just about everything but stick out his tongue at Costas.
 Costas, of course, did respond, saying: ''As anyone can plainly see, I'm 5-6 1/2 and a strapping 150, and unlike some people, I came by all of it naturally.''

HEADLINE: In Hollywood, a Sacred Cow Lands on the Contract Table

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
JASPER JOHNS isn't paid based on the number of years his flag paintings remain popular attractions at museums. Rem Koolhaas doesn't cash a check every time an architecture fan takes a trip to Seattle to see his space-age public library. So why should the writers, directors and actors responsible for box-office bombs like ''Gigli'' be able to pocket some cash every time somebody buys the DVD?
 It's a question that cuts to the heart of the biggest fight in Hollywood these days and sums up a fundamental choice the troubled entertainment industry needs to make: whether to cling to old blueprints for running the business or to draft a whole new set. 
 The spat, as always, is about money. Writers, who started talks with studios last month for a new three-year contract, want to be paid the way they always have. Movie script writers get an upfront payment, now at least $1 million for a major film, according to studio executives. Screenwriters then receive a residual whenever one of their titles is put on DVD, shown abroad or otherwise resold. Under the same system, a typical TV series writer may get $30,000 an episode, plus residuals.
 The residual payments vary widely, depending on a maze of formulas. A lead writer might earn hundreds of thousands from the DVD sales of a blockbuster movie; a junior member of a writing team for a dud might get a few thousand or less.
 Studios want to junk the residual payment structure, which dates to the early 1950s, when the fledgling TV business borrowed it from radio. Under their proposal, unveiled with unexpected zest in early July by Barry M. Meyer, chief executive of Warner Brothers Entertainment, so-called creative employees would get residual checks only after the studios have recouped their basic costs. 
 The two groups have reasonable arguments. In coming weeks and months, as both sides start huffing and puffing with even more intensity, the writers will declare that they can't trust Hollywood accounting as to when costs are covered. They'll also portray the effort to redraw the residual map as a huge rollback in wages. Young writers in particular will be hurt, they say, because they rely most heavily on residual income from failed movies and programs.
 Expect studios to battle back with hard facts on finances. While almost every project turned a profit when the residual structure was enacted, 6 out of 10 movies today will fail to make money even after they are distributed across multiple platforms, according to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. On the TV side, almost 90 percent of modern series fail to make money. Studios argue that it's ridiculous for a business to pay bonuses before it makes back its initial investment. 
 Already lost in this tit-for-tat skirmish, say analysts and economists who specialize in Tinseltown's peculiar business models, is the magnitude of the studios' decision to simply put the residual structure on the table. The studio bosses probably haven't figured out the best solution, said Josh Bernoff, a media analyst at Forrester Research, but perhaps for the first time they are insisting that cosmetic tweaks to their way of conducting business won't work.
 At a time when the likes of Paramount and Warner Brothers are having trouble turning a profit on movies that gross $200 million at the box office and the Internet is rapidly making the concept of intellectual property a quaint notion, the sacred treatment of residuals has an air of unreality, according to some economists.
 ''There is a good question about why they even pay residuals in the first place,'' said S. Abraham Ravid, a visiting professor of economics at Cornell, who recently studied how studios price screenplays differently, based on writers' box-office track records. 
 Few components of Hollywood's crumbling business model have been more carefully guarded over the years than residuals. Actors, directors and writers consider the fees something of a divine right, untouchable when contract negotiations heat up, as they are now, according to Harold L. Vogel, an independent media analyst and author of ''Entertainment Industry Economics.''
 John F. Bowman, chairman of the Writers Guild of America's negotiating committee, said he disagreed with the sacred part, but that untouchable was fair enough. ''These are wages to us,'' he said. ''They're not bonuses.'' He said he thinks that the studios are using the scary-sounding residual retrenchment to make their real target -- using material on the Internet without paying a hefty residual -- more palatable.
 When residuals started in the entertainment business, television was still a black-and-white blur and Shirley Temple reigned in movie theaters. In fact, radio actually came up with the system, said Charles Slocum, assistant executive director of the Writers Guild. In radio's early days, performances were always live -- sometimes as many as three times in a row -- to account for different time zones. The cast and crew were paid for each performance. 
 In the 1930s, radio networks began taping performances. But managers didn't trust the tape and insisted that the performers be on hand as the program rolled across time zones in case something didn't work. This, in part, created a precedent for paying a residual for a rerun, Mr. Slocum said. 
 As early as 1954, the upstart TV networks had the same worry about tape and adopted the same policy. The Screen Actors Guild, meanwhile, started agitating for residuals when movies were replayed on television. In 1960, with the networks and studios awash in money, they agreed. The system has changed little since. Though the unions want to keep it, they do want to change the formula to increase their residual payments. 
 The residuals fight is purely a labor issue. As far as United States copyright law is concerned, according to Mr. Slocum of the Writers Guild, movie writers are entitled to their initial fee and nothing more. The copyright for a movie automatically belongs to the entity that puts up the cash to make it.
 A strike, of course, would cripple both sides. So, as the battle over residuals boils over, perhaps writers and producers should heed the advice of someone who is both, Woody Allen: Take the money and run.

HEADLINE: Montana's Terror Economy

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE McNAMER. 
Deirdre McNamer is the author of the novel ''Red Rover.''

 BODY:
Missoula, Mont.
 BACK in the 1980s, my husband and I decided to drive from Missoula to Ann Arbor, Mich., crossing the Montana-Alberta border at Whitlash so we could travel in a foreign country for a while. The road was gravel and empty of other cars. All around us, tawny August prairie stretched to the Earth's curve. 
 At the border, it took us quite a while to get into Canada because we couldn't find the border agent, or any other human for that matter. There was just the one-room station and, in the distance, the sound of shots. We honked the horn and waited. Eventually, a guy with a pistol appeared from behind a low hill and announced himself as the border man and said he'd been doing target practice to keep himself busy. He looked wistful as he waved us through. 
 Back then, if we had seen a man on horseback riding along the border, standing in his stirrups to look around, we would have assumed that he was a rancher looking for straying livestock. Today, we'd have to consider the possibility that he was an operative for Operation Noble Mustang, in which wild horses from Bureau of Land Management holdings in the West are trained by prison inmates for use by border patrolmen on the lookout for smugglers and terrorists trying to enter the United States from Canada.
 The Department of Homeland Security now flies Blackhawk helicopters and other aircraft along the Montana-Canada border, out where it leaves the mountains and runs 460 miles from the Continental Divide to North Dakota. Agents in sport utility vehicles with night vision goggles zoom across the grasslands, and there are plans in the works for unmanned drones to monitor ground movements from the air. Most important to the residents of the little towns south of the border, scores of new border patrolmen -- 60 in 2004 alone -- have been brought in to live in northern Montana since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 That has been nothing but good news for a region that is desperate for wage-earners and house buyers and taxpayers. Protracted drought, a precipitous decline in the number of producing family farms and consequent out-migration have sucked a lot of the life out of towns that used to have busy restaurants, dress shops, car and farm-implement dealerships and full schools. The ''Waning West,'' some historians call these dryland, sparsely populated areas. Quiet, is what they feel like. Shuttered and quiet.
 There have been efforts to combat the effects of the decline with organized tourist draws like the Montana Dinosaur Trail (15 museums, interpretive centers and field stations that focus on the discoveries of dinosaur remains in central and eastern Montana) and the Craft Heritage Trails of North Central Montana, which celebrates handicrafts like quilting. But it's difficult to lure potential spenders to places where you have to imagine invisible presences and bygone days to feel you are somewhere of interest. And, in any case, they don't stay.
 At Shelby (population 3,000 or so), Interstate 15 intersects with Highway 2 and there is a sign that says, ''All roads lead to Shelby, crossroads of Western America.'' The town itself, if not a hub of some universe, seems relatively awake and humming along.
 Shelby, it has to be said, has never been a retiring little burg. It's the place, after all, that lured Jack Dempsey to defend his heavyweight championship title against Tommy Gibbons on July 4, 1923. It's a long and fascinating story, but the only sign of it now is a plaque near the Pizza Hut where the 40,000-seat arena once stood.
 Part of the reason Shelby is livelier than some of its neighbors today is a 500-inmate private prison that was built on the edge of town in 1999 that brought prison staff and new money. In 2003, the town bought a group of industrial buildings to the north, right on the border, betting that the specter of terrorism would make the purchase pay off. A year later, contractors began renovating them to accommodate up to 40 new Customs and Border Protection employees. Shelby got $6.5 million over 20 years to lease the buildings, and new families contributing to the local economy.
 It's a new, strange story. In a part of the country that was built on the most extravagant homesteaders' and oil-drillers' hopes for the future, economic health in this new century rides largely on the continued threat of threat itself.

HEADLINE: Vacation, All I Never Wanted

BYLINE: By Walter Kirn. 
Walter Kirn is a frequent contributor. His most recent novel is ''The Unbinding.''

 BODY:
First the provocative statistic, then a discussion of how it has been interpreted and then my own reflections on the topic, The Decline of the American Summer Vacation, an already-much-scrutinized phenomenon that accounts, as it happens, for my need to write this article efficiently and swiftly. Like the roughly 50 percent of working Americans who won't take warm-weather getaways this year (and the 46 percent of those who will take holidays but will stick by the pool instead of surfing the breakers so they can use their BlackBerrys and laptops), I'm scarily overtired and need to crash soon
So I'm pleased I've already dispensed with the statistics and am free to sweep on through the conventional wisdom about their possible meanings. 
 Simplified a bit, it runs as follows: a nation of remarkably productive, often well-paid workers who are becoming increasingly reluctant to pause from their labors and refresh their souls -- a nation whose cash-drenched corporate employers typically don't pay for much time off (less than two weeks annually, on average), a nation whose globe-gripping federal government is the only one in the whole industrialized world not to legally require generous periods of paid kick-back-and-hang time -- is a nation that's socially screwed up, particularly in comparison with European countries like France, which orders its citizens outside to play for the entire month of August and a few other weeks spread through the year. 
 The most widely cited diagnoses of our allegedly harmful undervacationing can be found by searching the Internet, the same Internet that even the dwindling number of full-vacation-takers are purportedly using to elevate their stress levels by logging on from beach resorts and national parks -- where, according to concerned observers, they would be better off restricting themselves to restorative, out-of-cellphone-range pursuits like brisk morning swims and sunset nature walks. That fewer of us are doing so, it's said, is a symptom of either anxious overcompetiveness (while I'm learning to fly-fish, that new guy down the hall is learning how to do my job); upward-mobility addiction (the cost of a 10-day Alaskan eco-trek is a down payment on a Lexus coupe!); the breakdown of the family (toasting s'mores for bored brats around a campfire is not a father's duty anymore); or, perhaps, a complicated bitterness over the fact that surpassing France's economy will never help us surpass its egotisms, so why bother aping the gourmet loafing that even most Frenchmen must sense has made them poorer? Why else would such slackers elect a hard-boiled president who ran as the champion of ''the France that wakes up early''?
 For me, the strongest of these notions is that it's hard to take time off if it means lying sleepless in your hammock, picturing some whiz-kid ''Art of War'' type assuming your duties back at headquarters. The other observations about our mounting aversion (except for the France riff, which I just stuck in there) strike me as Friday-afternoon say-something jobs by lifestyle journalists desperate to beat traffic and head off to their lakeside second homes -- the ones with the outdoor saunas and basement Pilates rooms whose four-star amenities might help explain why even lifestyle journalists take fewer vacations these days. And why their double-mortgaged readers do the same.
 Grasping the truth about why more Americans are taking holidays from their vacations is as easy as stepping outside your workplace (the lushest of which tempt employees to stay inside by offering lap pools, massage rooms and the like) and seeing that the recuperative promises of the old-style extended getaway -- the cleansing, amusing, soothing, stamina-raising therapeutic interludes that Eleanor Roosevelt once touted as a way for Americans ''to build up health and resistance'' -- are redeemable everywhere, in every form and so close by that it's a wonder thousand-mile drives in gear-packed station wagons still take place at all.
 Add a new verse, Woody Guthrie. This land is leisure land. Strip-mall day spas. Corner yoga studios. Suburban mega-gyms. Wholeness and Recovery Camps. And don't just behold, but gape upon and shiver at the colossal gaming-dining-bowling-Omnimaxing ultra-plexes whose honeycombed, multiplanar interiors evoke the vast convolutions of Utah canyons or the seemingly exitless great basilicas and which produce in me an awe that I felt coerced into experiencing during a boyhood trip to a billboard-hyped cavern in South Dakota, but didn't experience and had to fake so my dad wouldn't sulk and neglect to buy me ice cream.
 Before I fall off my desk chair from exhaustion (the price of being a die-hard who did take several weeks off this summer, thus dooming myself on my return to finishing a month's work in a few days), I'll conclude with a personal reflection and a bit of historical trivia. The duffel-bag-lugging vacations of my youth -- the kind that are losing popularity now in part because of the day-spa, lake-house ways of some of the melancholic high-caste Francophiles who discern in the trend a spiritual uptightness -- always struck me as forced, unnatural, compulsory. Did people take long vacations out of instinct, to quench an urgent appetite, or had vacations been consciously devised by some overbearing master-protector figure rather like my dad? The answer is that the ritual arose, to a substantial degree, from a decree. I was right, it turns out, so astonishingly right that rather than explaining what I have learned, I'd prefer to let the reader discover it for himself, and shudder. Type the phrase ''Strength Through Joy'' into a search engine, even if you're on a trip right now. Hint: The motto, as its utopian terseness instantly leads you to suspect, is a translation from the German. Another hint: Lederhosen. Conclusion: Invigoration-through-vacationing is not the expression of some bursting life force but, in large part, a Triumph of the Will.

DEVILS IN THE SUGAR SHOP. By Timothy Schaffert. (Unbridled, paper, $14.95.) Think ''Sex and the City.'' Now make the city ... Omaha. The circle of women in this sprightly and eager-to-please novel -- an artist, a writer, a hostess of sex-toy parties and a pair of twins who own a bookstore -- are wise and worldly, enjoying the gentrification campaign that has given them their own ersatz Manhattan. Ashley, a writer of sexy novels that don't sell very well, conducts erotica-writing workshops and fights valiantly against the genre's cliches, ''forbidding any character's mouth from forming into 'a perfect O' of pleasure or surprise or delight, or into an O of anything, for that matter.'' With her best friends -- Viv, the artist, and Deedee, who has found great success selling, Tupperware-style, what used to be called ''marital aids'' -- Ashley has made her little slice of redeveloped downtown Omaha into a swanky scene that meets chick lit's exacting locational criteria. 
But its setting aside, can a novel still be called chick lit if (a) it's written by a guy, and (b) most of the chicks in question are in their late 30s to early 40s and not especially interested in shoes? When the characters spend as much time as these do searching for love, sipping cocktails and seeking comfort in one another's company, the answer is yes, though Schaffert's version of it is a good deal smarter and funnier than most of the disposable volumes cluttering up this genre's walk-in closet.
WHO IS LOU SCIORTINO? By Ottavio Cappellani. Translated by Howard Curtis. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper, $13.) Reading this chaotic if sporadically funny first novel by Cappellani, a Sicilian journalist, one can easily picture the author typing beneath a framed photograph of Elmore Leonard. Between its plot (which echoes ''Get Shorty''), its mannered take on hard-boiled prose and its juxtapositions of carnage and comedy, it's practically an homage. But without Leonard's cool self-control, Cappellani quickly lets his story get out of hand, and he's never able to rein things back in. Lou Sciortino is the grandson of Don Lou, a New York mob kingpin with strong ties to the Sicilian operation. With an eye toward money laundering, Don Lou sets his grandson up in the movie business. But when someone plants a bomb at the office, it's off to the old country for young Lou, who's expected to lie low. Once there, however, he falls in with the local Mafiosi, and before long he's running errands for Don Lou's old rival Sal Scali. There are some funny scenes and characters here -- take, for example, the penitent pimp who tries to get all his girls straight jobs, only to have them complain bitterly about the hassle of opening bank accounts and finding husbands -- but the tonal shifts from farce to violence are handled clumsily, and the action feels both overpopulated and underdeveloped. 
 THE FAITH HEALER OF OLIVE AVENUE. By Manuel MuA$(1$)oz. (Algonquin, paper, $12.95.) Fresno, in California's Central Valley, is only a few hours' drive from both San Francisco and Los Angeles. But for the characters in this moving and tender story collection it might as well be in another world entirely -- one where the gay sensibility is defined mainly by yearning rather than glittering experience, and where the added difficulty of reconciling one's homosexuality with tradition-bound Mexican-American culture can drive a person to despair. All of these stories are set within a single neighborhood on Fresno's heavily Hispanic working-class outskirts, and their energy derives from the friction between the characters' conflicting desires for love and acceptance, escape and permanence. In ''Bring Brang Brung,'' the father of a kindergarten-age boy returns to Fresno from San Francisco after the death of his lover and finds that he needs, more than he's willing to admit, the company and comfort of his sister, who never left home. The young gay man in ''The Good Brother'' lives with his disabled mother and has put his own life on indefinite hold. ''He accepts his position in this world much too easily, as if someday (but not now) he will return the glances he receives from the beautiful man in the red Datsun pickup on Tuesdays at the grocery store. Someday his life will begin.'' MuA$(1$)oz writes elegantly and sympathetically about these men, their families and their private aches. His stories are far too rich to be classified under the limiting rubrics of ''gay'' or ''Chicano'' fiction; they have a softly glowing, melancholy beauty that transcends those categories and makes them universal. 
 THE FOLDED WORLD. By Amity Gaige. (Other Press, $23.95.) In this tightly written and emotionally satisfying novel, a young couple's marriage is thrown into jeopardy by the husband's workaholic tendencies -- a bad situation made worse given that he's a social worker dealing with mentally ill clients. Charlie Shade moves to New England from the Midwest, where a golden childhood has fostered in him a sense of obligation to help those less fortunate. His wife, Alice, is well read and whip-smart, though disappointed at the prospect of handing her life over to newborn twin daughters at the very moment she was hoping to pursue the college education she had deferred. When Charlie takes on as a client Opal, a deeply disturbed woman with no friends or family, his natural empathy overtakes his judgment and he gets too close for the comfort of his boss, his wife and himself. Meanwhile, Alice finds herself drawn to one of Charlie's former clients, Hal, a brooding bookstore clerk who keeps sending her home with Proust and Samuel Richardson, along with a fluttering heart and a nagging doubt. Gaige, the author of the well-received novel ''O My Darling,'' is better at describing the mysteries of a fragile marriage than the workings of a fragile mind -- her attempts to write in the voices of Opal or Hal come across as overly mannered -- but she's extraordinarily adept at revealing her characters' personalities in just a few words. If the novel's climactic ending seems a little too cinematic (a desperate lover sprints down the road through heavy fog, dodging oncoming traffic, shouting his beloved's name), it doesn't make the moment any less stirring. 
 THOREAU'S LAUNDRY: Stories. By Ann Harleman. (Southern Methodist University, $22.50.) Love tested -- by illness, by betrayal, by absence -- is the subject of Ann Harleman's second story collection. In many of these tales, the normal course of love is halted and redirected by a calamitous event: the onset and cruel progress of a spouse's debilitating disease, the discovery of adultery, the initiation of a child-custody battle. In that last story, ''Street of Swans,'' one of the collection's strongest, an American translator living on a temporary visa in the glasnost-era Soviet Union is loath to return to the United States, for fear of losing her young daughter to her ex-husband. Meanwhile, a Russian man of her acquaintance has fallen in love with her. ''Was it then the idea first came to me?'' she wonders. ''Russian women married in order to leave; I needed to stay.'' Harleman is capable of startling a reader with a perfect descriptive touch, as when one character sees her ex-husband on television and turns off the set, making him vanish ''with a snap, like a wishbone breaking,'' or when she notes that an orchestra tuning up before a performance makes ''quick interrogative sounds.'' But there's even more pleasure to be had in watching these characters stubbornly continue their march toward love, even as they must dodge the slings and arrows that fortune hurls their way.

HEADLINE: Rats, Roaches and the Naked Man With the Gun

BYLINE: By STEVEN TORRES. 
Steven Torres, a contributor to ''Bronx Noir,'' a new collection of short fiction published by Akashic Books, is the author of ''The Concrete Maze,'' a novel to be published this month by Dorchester.

 BODY:
IN 1979 and 1980, my father, Esteban Torres, worked under an exterminator's license setting traps in and fumigating businesses and homes throughout the Bronx and Manhattan. I won't bore you with roach and rodent stories -- those could run on forever. Instead, I'll tell you about some of the people my father worked for, the ones he called crazy or knuckleheads. 
 I'll start with two incidents in which clients put guns to my father's head and he proceeded to fumigate their apartments anyway, after talking them into lowering their weapons.
 In one apartment building on East 14th Street in Manhattan, a woman in a first-floor apartment wished him luck as he went up the stairs to the first apartment he was going to work in. That seemed a strange thing to say to an exterminator. After all, my dad was carrying a tank of chemicals that could stop a charging rhino; the roaches might be tough, but the deck was stacked in my dad's favor. 
 When he stood knocking at the door for a few minutes, minutes during which he was sure he heard someone inside, he thought he'd figured out the woman's meaning. People made appointments they didn't want to keep but never bothered to cancel. You needed good luck just to get some customers to actually open the door. This looked like one of those cases, so he climbed down a flight to the next apartment on his list. This one seemed to be truly empty. As my father waited for a response, he felt cold steel pressed against the back of his head. 
 ''What are you doing here?'' the man holding the gun wanted to know. 
 ''I'm the exterminator,'' my father answered. 
 The man wanted to see ID. My father held up the tank of chemicals, along with the gas mask he used in hopes of avoiding cancer. It took a while, but the man with the gun relented and escorted my father back to the apartment upstairs. 
 When my father was finished, he waited patiently for the man with the gun to produce a check for $25, which was the charge for an apartment back then. When my father finally left the building, the woman on the first floor asked if anything had happened. When my dad mentioned the whole gun thing, she just laughed.
 ''That guy's crazy,'' she said. ''He says he's training to be in the C.I.A., has to sneak up on people. Take them by surprise.'' 
 My father left the building without bothering to look back. He didn't want to know if the C.I.A. trainee was aiming at him from his window.
 The other incident took place in a building on East Fourth Street, and the fellow in question was more straightforward. When my father knocked, the door was opened by a man with a gun. No clothes on, just a gun. 
 ''Exterminator,'' my father said. The man lowered the gun.
 My father did the standard spraying along the perimeter of the living room walls as the man sat there naked, an array of joints on the coffee table. As my father headed toward a closed bedroom door, the man jumped up and ordered him to leave it alone.
 So my father, having finished his work, just stood there.
 ''What?'' the man demanded.
 ''The money,'' my father replied. Another check for $25 changed hands.
 I've often wondered what might have been behind the closed door if the man wasn't afraid to show my dad the drugs or the gun or his own naked body. But these questions never concerned my father. Neither did the barely clothed women, or the spouses who argued as he set traps, or the parents who screamed at their children while he put out poisons. To him, they were all just crazy. What concerned my father was leaving the Bronx.
 Then, as now, the Bronx had very nice neighborhoods, places with tree-lined streets, excellent schools, million-dollar homes. We didn't live there. We lived in East Tremont, the place where Hollywood came when it needed a set for the opening of the gritty crime drama ''Fort Apache, the Bronx.''
 In addition to being an exterminator, my father was the custodian for the Tremont branch of the New York Public Library on Washington Avenue. The job included a rent-free apartment, which was where we lived. 
 About 20 other custodians had similar accommodations, but ours came with a view of abandoned, burnt-out and gutted buildings in just about every direction. Across the street was an abandoned building where heroin addicts went to shoot up, stumbling out in a daze. Sometimes they left candles burning, and mattresses caught fire. The fire trucks came, but the flames were never serious enough to harm the squatters who lived on the top floor. Besides, the fire station was only two blocks away.
 PART of my father's job at the library was to keep the exterior of the building free of gang graffiti. As with exterminating, this also required the use of harsh chemicals. My father being an asthmatic, both his jobs were tough on his lungs, but health issues were not going to force him out of work. 
 A free apartment, a salary from the library, my mother's salary earned as a library clerk in an even worse neighborhood and whatever he could make from the exterminating business were all too much to pass up. He had a plan, and he intended to do everything he could to make it work. His plan was to move the family to the countryside in Puerto Rico. 
 This wasn't an original idea. My father had left Puerto Rico as a 12-year-old and had met my mother, Carmen, who was also from Puerto Rico, in New York. My parents had deep roots on the island. To them, leaving behind the dirt and danger of the big city for the quiet and calm of island life seemed natural. 
 My sisters and I hated the idea. We'd been to the island but barely spoke a word of Spanish. We had friends in the Bronx -- never mind that we weren't allowed out on the streets to play with them. 
 As fate would have it, the move to Puerto Rico lasted only a year. A recession brought us back to the city. My mother took up her old job as a library clerk, my sisters and I made new friends, and my father found work as part of a crew that cleaned a bank overnight. He could have taken up his gas mask again and made more money as an exterminator, but the idea didn't appeal to him. He had liked most of his customers. He could handle the rats and the roaches. It was the crazies and the knuckleheads that kept him away.

HEADLINE: The Dispirit of '67

BYLINE: By THOMAS LYNCH. 
Thomas Lynch, a funeral director, is the author, most recently, of the memoir ''Booking Passage.''

 BODY:
Milford, Mich.
 THE men I have coffee with most mornings in town are all in what we never call the last trimester of our lives. We're winding down, golfing more, worried that what's ahead won't be as good as what's gone before. We are retiring or retirees. Our memories are more certain than our prospects. Some things, we say, are changing. Some things never do. 
 Forty years ago, we were driving up Woodward Avenue in our souped-up Dodges, Chevys and Fords, ogling braless girls and hot rods at suburban drive-ins, lip-syncing Motown and protest songs, rooting for the Tigers, who were winning that year. We were white and male, native-born Americans -- the big three when it came to playing the odds. We could be anything, like Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. The future seemed full of possibilities. We were freshly minted, or newly wed, or just beginning our careers or, like me, in the first year of college -- trying to decide what to do with life and time. 
 The covers of Life and Time that first week of August '67 featured the God-awful riots in Detroit. There was a distant, ugly war, a siege mentality in the White House and troubling signs in the economy. The body count half a world away, the failed leadership, the terrible inequities of life on the planet seemed incidental to our youth and promise. Though '67 was a summer of discontent, we were, in retrospect, still banking on what our parents had banked on: other big threes -- truth, justice and the American way, and, in Michigan anyway, ''Generous'' Motors, Chrysler and Ford. 
 Now, years since, we all -- the teachers and engineers, lawyers and politicos, bankers and test drivers, insurance agent and real estate agent, the pastor, the ad man and undertaker -- draw pensions or pay packets from an economy that trickled down from Henry Ford's assembly line and the boom it brought to the Motor City, its leafy suburbs and upstate vacation towns on Michigan's great and inland lakes. Everything hereabouts came from cars and the people who came here decades ago to make them. 
 That industry, like many of us, has passed its prime. ''Going back in history,'' says David Cole, director of the Center for Automotive Research, in Ann Arbor, ''these companies have been ... the Rock of Gibraltar. That's not true anymore. The Rock of Gibraltar has turned into a sandbar.'' 
 A friend from the old days who, like thousands hereabouts, took early retirement from Ford, laments, ''I'm not ready to be a greeter at Wal-Mart's, but I'm too old to go back to school.'' With his buyout money, he and his son are starting a landscape company. ''I'm learning Spanish, to talk to our crews,'' he says. ''How's that for globalization?''
 Michigan languishes in what one crowd calls a ''one-state recession,'' which they attribute to union greed and taxes, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the current governor, and what the other crowd insists is a ''one-industry recession,'' which they lay to executive greed and globalization, pigheadedness on energy and environmental policy and the former governor. As in that August of 1967, when George W. Romney was governor and a favorite for the Republican nomination, our local midsummer woes seem like harbingers of the nation's. By month's end he'd let slip the truth about ''brainwashing'' with regard to his former support for the war. By April of the next year he was out of the race, Lyndon Johnson was a lame duck, and the murderous cycle of riots, assassinations and lost causes was about to bring Richard Nixon to power.
 Forty years on and we're still in an ugly distant war. Detroit remains among the most segregated cities in America. The white, male, native-born Americans of our generation -- Bill Clinton and Al Gore, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney -- for all their promise, have been disappointing. Another Governor Romney is running for president. We have our lame duck, our lost cause and the Tigers winning again this year. Some things change, we say. Some things never do. Whether history repeats itself remains to be seen. At coffee most mornings, alas, we do.

HEADLINE: The City of Napa, No Longer Willing To Be Left Behind

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
NAPA, Calif.
 THERE is Napa, the valley, with its picturesque vineyards, boutique hotels and wineries. Then there is this blue-collar community of diners and bowling alleys, sitting at the southern end of the affluent valley to which it lent its name.
 For years, it was virtually impossible to confuse the two. Napa, the city, rarely gave outsiders much reason to stop. And residents here were proud of that distinction, content to shirk the limelight as limousines sped along nearby Route 29.
 ''You travel around the world and everyone knows where Napa is, but the town of Napa had been left behind,'' said Mike DeSimoni Sr., the president of Channel Properties in Richmond, which is building Napa's first mixed-use development. 
 The city of Napa is quickly catching up with its more famous neighbors farther north, like Yountville, St. Helena and Rutherford, adding wine-tasting rooms, upscale restaurants and hotels in its drive to remake itself into something of a Yountville South. Developers have poured more than $300 million into new stores, offices and condominiums, which promise to double the size of Napa's downtown. A Westin hotel is under construction; the Ritz-Carlton has one planned. 
 ''This is a huge change for Napa,'' said David Buurma, a vice president at NAI BT Commercial, a real estate brokerage company with offices in Napa. ''Ten years ago downtown was a ghost town.''
 Built on a flood plain, the city is one of the most flood-prone in the state. But in 1998, Napa County residents voted to raise taxes for an ambitious flood-control project. 
 The Napa River Flood Management Plan, sponsored by the Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, would widen the river's channel, restore wetlands, raise bridges and move low-lying homes. The $300 million project, which was supposed to be completed this year, is only halfway done because federal money has been slow in coming, according to the city. 
 It was this project, though, that has given the developers the confidence to build. In 2001, Copia, a food, wine and arts center developed by the wine pioneer Robert Mondavi, opened its doors. Other projects followed, and in the last eight years, more than $400 million in private and public funds have been invested in various developments. 
 ''Most of this didn't just happen by accident,'' said Arthur Jacobus, Copia's president. ''Mondavi knew it was a strategic decision to put Copia in Napa, and he viewed it as an economic catalyst for the city.''
 New housing developments have also started to change the face of Napa, bringing in hundreds of new residents -- from second-home buyers to people from the San Francisco Bay area looking for less expensive housing. 
 Former ranchland is being plowed under for new homes around the city and more are expected. In the last 10 years, there have been 2,969 building permits for new apartments, condominiums and single-family homes filed with the city. Builders have included the Castle Companies and Edenbridge Homes.
 Among the newer projects is Oak Leaf Ranch by Delco Builders and Developers -- 45 single-family homes being built on former pasture land for horses. Prices for the three- to four-bedroom homes, which will have vaulted ceilings and porches, start at $832,000. ''The speed of development and gentrification has shocked a lot of long-time Napans,'' said Lauren Coodley, a professor of psychology and history at Napa Valley College who has written about Napa. ''Some people who grew up here feel like their town has been taken away from them.''
 Blue-collar workers could afford to buy in Napa, and for decades, Napa was the industrial heart of the valley. Many people worked at a nearby Navy shipyard until the federal government shut it down 11 years ago. A pipe plant was another large employer, but that closed three years ago because of rising expenses. 
 But over the last seven years, median housing prices have risen 99 percent to $550,000 in June, according to DataQuick Information Systems, a San Diego real estate company.
 Some long-time residents, concerned about Napa losing its small-town flavor, say they are selling their homes and moving to Oregon, Nevada and Washington State. Others who cannot afford to buy are also leaving. 
 ''This is a very hard thing to watch,'' said Cathy Mathews, 59, a fifth-generation Napa resident. ''Most people I've worked with or grown up with have gone out of state because they can't afford to live here anymore.''
 Napa the city has clearly been discovered. Tight restrictions on agricultural land elsewhere in the valley have forced hotel operators to look at Napa. Intrawest spent three years scouting the valley for property large enough to build its 161-room condo hotel before it bought a 3.5-acre parcel from Copia in 2005. Hit with soaring debt and slow ticket sales, Copia has sold or leased some of its land.
 ''It's literally the only place in Napa where you can develop projects of this scale,'' said Benno Nager, a vice president of development at Intrawest. 
 If sales at the Westin Verasa, Intrawest's project, are any indication, condo hotels should do well in Napa. More than half of its 161 units, ranging in price from $500,000 to $1.2 million, have sold since November. 
 The Oxbow Public Market, a new artisan food hall going up nearby, has also helped to attract buyers. John Moore, an ocean lifeguard in Newport Beach, bought a studio for $417,000 in November without even seeing the property. 
 ''Napa is internationally known; it's one of the places that people want to visit,'' said Mr. Moore, who is 34. ''How could I go wrong?''
 Other businesses, encouraged by all the development, have moved into the area. Last fall, Mason Cellars opened its first tasting room in Napa.
 ''If a business has the ability to wait, I think it will be spectacular,'' said Randy Mason, the owner and winemaker at Mason Cellars.
 Mr. DeSimoni of Channel Properties is betting big on Napa. A Napa resident, he has invested $50 million in the Riverfront, a two-tower project with offices, condominiums and retail space, on the banks of the Napa River. Construction began in June.
 Although prices have not been set for the 50 condos, which range in size from one to three bedrooms, Mr. DeSimoni said he has already collected 178 names of people who are interested in buying. That alone has convinced him the project will do well.
 ''At times you get butterflies,'' Mr. DeSimoni said. ''I think the time is right and downtown is finally on the right track.''

HEADLINE: First Came Style; Now, Substance

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
La Patrie, Quebec
 HEADING north on Route 257 through southeastern Quebec, it occurred to me that Audi's second-generation TT is a perfect example of how, sometimes, it can take years to fulfill a promise. Then my thoughts turned to manure.
 The first TT arrived in the United States as a 2000 model, and the rounded little Bauhaus design made visual promissory notes: It would be wonderful to drive. 
 But we were tricked. The steering lacked feel and the driving experience was rather average, not coming close to matching the magic of the TT's appearance.
 For the 2008 model year Audi has an all-new TT, which is on sale now. A stronger body and redesigned suspension have delivered huge improvements in its handling, finally giving it the performance to back up its come-hither-and-enjoy-driving look. 
 As before, there are coupe and convertible versions and a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. There are two engines: a new turbocharged 2-liter 4 producing 200 horsepower or a carried-over 3.2-liter V-6 that makes 250 horsepower. You can get a six-speed manual or six-speed dual-clutch automatic. Unfortunately, there are restrictions on what goes with what.
 Prices start at $35,575 for a front-wheel drive coupe with the 4-cylinder engine, which comes only with the automatic.
 Those who want the V-6 must also take the quattro all-wheel drive system and a price of $42,275. A six-speed manual is standard on this version; the automatic is an option.
 All-wheel drive is not available with the turbo 4, although Audi is thinking of changing that, said Filip Brabec, product planning manager for Audi of America. 
 For those who desire a convertible, the least-expensive TT Roadster is $37,575 with front drive and the turbo 4. A version with the V-6 and all-wheel drive starts at $45,275. 
 The roadster that I tested had the V-6 and the automatic and a base price of $46,675. The final price was $51,225 with options including fancier leather upholstery, larger 18-inch wheels and an upgraded stereo system with Sirius Satellite Radio.
 But back to the manure. Starting early one summer morning my wife, Cheryl, and I drove north from our home in New Hampshire along Route 3, passing the First, Second and Third Connecticut Lakes. These are names that hint at a lack of pioneer poetic imagination but excellent counting skills.
 By 10 a.m. we crossed into Canada and were headed toward this farming town advertised by a small, weathered sign in French that translated to ''Let us charm you.'' A few minutes later, the smell of manure hit with the drenching pungency possible when a convertible top is down and olfactory protection is drastically reduced.
 If we'd had some additional warning (''Let us charm you, but we stink'') we could have quickly protected ourselves. Putting the top up (or down) is possible with a push of a button even while the car is moving up to 25 miles an hour.
 Incidentally, the power open-close mechanism worked flawlessly; the top was snug.
 With an overall length of 164.5 inches, the new TT is 5.4 inches longer, but the biggest change cannot be seen. It is the extensive use of aluminum (there is still some steel) to achieve strength with less weight. The advantage of this new structure can be felt easily. Anyone familiar with the tiresome shake and wiggle of a poorly done convertible will be amazed by the TT's wonderful solidity even on the worst surfaces.
 Inside, the TT feels sports-car intimate without being crowded, and Audi's tradition of handsome accommodations continues. The basic controls are easy to use, lacking the classic Teutonic approach in which mystery is preferred over logic.
 All the good safety gear is standard, including stability control; antilock brakes; rollover hoops intended to keep noggins off pavement; and seat-mounted bags to protect chests and heads in side impacts.
 The coupe and roadster each has more cargo capacity than the first TT and could easily be used for a weekend trip. 
 By noon we had spent about two hours in Canada and saw no reason to wear out our welcome. We crossed into Maine at Coburn Gore and headed south on Route 27, a smooth two-lane with turns ranging from benevolent sweepers to tricky kinks. Route 27's straights can be short, but with the TT it was easy to build speed. 
 The 3.2 liter V-6 is rated at 236 pound-feet of torque, all available between 2,500 and 3,000 revolutions a minute. Part of the swiftness comes from the S Tronic dual-clutch automatic with six gears chosen for strong acceleration, not maximum fuel economy. 
 The dual-clutch gizmo means quick gear changes (Audi claims 0.2 seconds) and, unlike a manual or conventional automatic, there is no discernable drop in power as the gears change. It is also an extraordinarily eager gearbox that needs no more than a hint that the driver needs a downshift.
 Audi says a TT with S Tronic is slightly quicker than a six-speed manual. Going from zero to 60 m.p.h. takes 5.3 seconds, compared with 5.5 seconds for a car shifted with manual labor. 
 On most turns, the TT is a delight. The steering has a good feel and is nicely weighted, inspiring the confidence and communication crucial in a good sports car. 
 Thanks to a redesigned suspension and extra-sticky summer tires (you can choose all-seasons instead) there is so much cornering power that blind mountain turns at high speeds come with a greatly reduced fright factor. 
 Alas, it is on the tight turns, like hairpins, that the TT becomes less fun and shows its weak point. It begins feeling nose-heavy and less willing to change direction, reminding the driver that about 59 percent of its weight is up front, far from the ideal 50-50 balance.
 On a rough surface the TT's ride is comfortable, at least for a sports car. That means the TT is suitable for enjoyable long-distance travel. It is not one of those rough-riding, tiring sports cars no good for anything more than an afternoon romp.
 By midafternoon we were home, having covered 336 miles on our TT International Tour, more than enough to come to some sunny and solid conclusions. While the original TT was a dynamic disappointment, Audi has learned its lesson and made nice with the new car. It has not just looks and style but the anytime-anywhere acceleration, cornering and braking that finally make the TT as delightful to drive as to look at. 
 INSIDE TRACK: Well worth the wait, and that's no cow manure.

GRAPHIC: Photo: LOGICAL: TT's controls make sense, and the interior is Audi-handsome.
 TRY, TRY AGAIN: For 2008, Audi has redesigned its TT Roadster, left, and coupe to give them a more sporting demeanor.

To the Editor:
 It was disappointing to see Paul Krugman (''The French Connection,'' column, July 23) dismiss the significant progress of American broadband deployment. 
 Mr. Krugman says that broadband adoption in the United States falls short of France, Germany and Japan. Yet there are 340 people per square kilometer in Japan, 236 in Germany, 116 in France and only 33 in the United States. Our nation's broadband providers must reach 301 million people, more than the populations of France, Germany and Japan combined. 
 Rather than insist that apples are oranges, economists should ask three simple questions: Is American broadband capacity growing? Are prices falling? And are choices and services expanding? The answer to all three queries is a resounding ''oui.''

HEADLINE: What Doctors Make, and Why

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 In ''Sending Back the Doctor's Bill'' (Week in Review, July 29), you compare the incomes of American physicians with those earned by doctors in other countries and suggest that American doctors seem overpaid. A more relevant benchmark, however, would seem to be the earnings of the American talent pool from which American doctors must be recruited.
 Any college graduate bright enough to get into medical school surely would be able to get a high-paying job on Wall Street. The obverse is not necessarily true. Against that benchmark, every American doctor can be said to be sorely underpaid. 
 Besides, cutting doctors' take-home pay would not really solve the American cost crisis. The total amount Americans pay their physicians collectively represents only about 20 percent of total national health spending. Of this total, close to half is absorbed by the physicians' practice expenses, including malpractice premiums, but excluding the amortization of college and medical-school debt. 
 This makes the physicians' collective take-home pay only about 10 percent of total national health spending. If we somehow managed to cut that take-home pay by, say, 20 percent, we would reduce total national health spending by only 2 percent, in return for a wholly demoralized medical profession to which we so often look to save our lives. It strikes me as a poor strategy. 
 Physicians are the central decision makers in health care. A superior strategy might be to pay them very well for helping us reduce unwarranted health spending elsewhere. 
 Uwe E. Reinhardt Princeton, N.J., July 30, 2007
 The writer is a professor of political economy at Princeton University.
 To the Editor:
 While doctors in the United States make more money than their counterparts in Europe, European doctors are rarely, if ever, personally liable for the cost of their professional education. American doctors make more, in part, to offset the astronomical cost of medical school. Medical students now graduate with an average of $130,000 in academic debt from undergraduate and professional school.
 If we are to restructure the system by which we pay doctors to match Europe, which seems prudent as well as inevitable, we must also finance education as Europeans do, by using state dollars to finance the full or majority cost of higher education, including professional school. 
 Until we do, we will be hard pressed to find doctors willing to work for less, and will continue to push our newly minted medical professionals out of lower paid primary care and pediatric work and away from our lower-income communities.
 Amelia M. Hershberger Albany, July 30, 2007
 To the Editor:
 ''Sending Back the Doctor's Bill'' brought me back to my days as a young medical economist at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland years ago. I learned then that high-quality health care could be provided more cost-effectively when the relatively fixed costs of salaried physician groups, health centers and hospitals were supported by monthly ''dues'' paid by or on behalf of enrolled members.
 Prepaid group practice, as the model was called, stood in stark contrast to the dominant fee-for-service, solo practice system (or nonsystem). The combination of fixed prepayments and multispecialty physician groups encouraged corridor consultation, collaboration and continual peer review; and provided incentives to deliver preventive and curative care in the most appropriate settings -- in contrast to the incentives inherent in the prevailing procedure-driven, fee-for-service reimbursement system as you describe. 
 The results included better coordination of care with dramatically lower rates of hospitalization and elective surgical procedures.
 Now often subsumed under the more amorphous H.M.O. umbrella, the concept of prepaid group practice remains sound today. Although attractive to participating physicians and patients alike, this model has not gained wide acceptance beyond the West Coast and certain progressive markets like Minneapolis-St. Paul and Boston. As you suggest, the forces resisting change to the status quo remain formidable. 
 Roger W. Birnbaum Morristown, N.J., July 31, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Last week, I had the annual checkup for my 2000 Taurus. I paid $95 per hour for much needed body work. Next month, when I have my own annual physical, I expect and hope to pay a much higher rate to my primary care internist, who has spent a significant portion of his life training to achieve his position of responsibility. 
 Although both important, the maintenance of my health far exceeds the relative importance of the health of my automobile. However, evidently, you seem to advocate further reducing the income of doctors to the levels reported in a survey five years ago in Europe of $60,000 to $120,000. How many of our brightest sons and daughters will seek those positions?
 Ray Groves New Canaan, Conn., July 29, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 You point out that it is the high salaries paid to American doctors that helps make our medical system so costly compared with other nations. The cure is obvious, end the monopoly. While obvious, it is not easy; the American Medical Association is in fact the strongest union in the nation. 
 Since the American public has accepted relocation of much of our manufacturing to China and India, why not accept opening our medical schools to everyone qualified and accept an unlimited number of doctors from foreign countries? Why can we use the word competition when speaking of sports, manufacturing or just about every industry, but it is regarded as a dirty word when speaking about our medical industry? 
 William Bazik Fairview Park, Ohio, July 30, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Your thoughtful article about the cost of health care is well taken, but your emphasis on the details of payment and insurance systems obscures the larger context of market forces.
 Doctors will be able to charge high prices for their services as long as demand for them outstrips supply. 
 Health care conservatives favor the free-market approach of denying services to those who cannot afford them. If liberals want to remove this constraint on demand, then they will have to bolster supply. 
 The fact that so few people become doctors despite the job's salary, stability and prestige tells us that somewhere in the pipeline of medical training and accreditation lurks a bottleneck. 
 Conservatives have put forward one possible solution: tort reform. Liberals should give it careful consideration.

HEADLINE: The Return of the Multitaskers (a k a Conglomerates)

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
HAROLD S. GENEEN, then chief executive of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, appeared on the cover of Time magazine in September 1967 with the headline ''Conglomerates: The New Business Giants.'' I.T.T.'s holdings were as disparate as insurance, hotels and real estate, and its sales reached $17 billion in 1970.
 I.T.T.'s status as a symbol of the quintessential American business was short-lived, however. The company was accused of helping to topple President Salvador Allende Gossens of Chile and was the focus of numerous investigations, and the conglomerate as a business model faded over the years. Instead, the new mantra became one of stressing ''core competencies'' -- in other words, concentrating on a relatively few businesses in which the companies excelled.
 But among the flood of companies reporting second-quarter earnings, there is a largely unheralded trend: the conglomerates are back, and back in a big way. And investors are noticing. 
 I.T.T., now a $7.8 billion-a-year company based in a modest office park in White Plains, reported a 52 percent surge in earnings on the basis of sales in water treatment systems and military and surveillance systems. The company's chief executive, Steven R. Loranger, says the company is on track for a fifth consecutive year of record profitability. Its stock trades at very rich price-to-earnings ratio of about 20, based on current-year earnings. ''We've reinvented ourselves,'' Mr. Loranger said.
 Other revitalized conglomerates include Textron, based in Providence, R.I., and the owner of companies like Cessna and Bell Helicopter. Textron beat earnings forecasts by 24 cents a share, according to a Cowen & Company analysts' report that called the period a ''blowout'' quarter. And Honeywell International, a diversified industrial company based in Morristown, N.J., recorded a 17 percent rise in second-quarter profit, largely on the strength of its aerospace holdings.
 This universe of 25 to 30 companies is outperforming the market as a whole and would be doing even better if not for the fact that General Electric, which pioneered many of the management techniques they are using, has performed relatively poorly. Still, C. Stephen Tusa Jr., an analyst at JPMorgan Securities, estimates that even after recent volatility, the financial markets are giving the 13 diversified industrial companies he covers a P/E ratio of 18 for the current year, compared with about 15.5 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. ''It's a 15 percent premium,'' Mr. Tusa said.
 This class of companies includes such well-known giants as United Technologies, 3M and Siemens, but also a raft of smaller companies like Danaher, Emerson Electric and Illinois Tool Works. Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway also owns diverse industrial companies, but because it does not seek to actively manage its holdings in an integrated fashion, it isn't generally included as part of this category. 
 To some extent, the new conglomerates have simply become lucky. They are riding a global infrastructure spending boom for airports and airlines, power systems, waste water and environmental projects, and hospitals and health care systems, not to mention record government spending on military projects and security surveillance. Their ability to assemble product offerings from different industries is a source of strength, they say.
 Ken Cornelius, president and chief executive of Siemens One, an Atlanta-based subsidiary of the German parent company, says Siemens can provide up to 40 percent of the goods and services needed to build a new hospital, for example, ranging from medical imaging equipment and information technology systems to power systems and building automation equipment. Many of the diversified industrial companies are well positioned to take advantage of global opportunities because their offshore sales are typically 35 to 50 percent of their total revenue.
 But the chief executives of these companies (as well as many Wall Street analysts) say that there's more to it than just luck -- that they have largely transformed how they do business over the past five years. Gone are the days when C.E.O.'s bought largely unrelated companies and held them in nearly passive portfolios of assets without seeking to transform their managements, processes or products.
 ''When you look back at the history, the companies were put together without any real integration,'' said David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell. ''They were really just holding companies. They didn't try to do anything to make the businesses better.''
 This new breed of C.E.O. has embraced many of the techniques of John F. Welch Jr. at G.E. and borrowed liberally from the lean production techniques of Toyota Motor as well. Technological systems, like enterprise resource planning software, allow them to manage their companies more tightly. They are training top executives to think about their whole enterprises, not just about small pieces of the whole. And rather than being sleepy backwaters, some of these conglomerates have become innovators. 
 ''We've had to radically change every aspect of how we make decisions, how we behave and how we execute,'' said Lewis B. Campbell, chief executive of Textron.
 The remaking of old-line conglomerates seems to have started around the time of the 2001-2002 recession. Honeywell faced particular problems because of its merger with Allied Signal and a subsequent unsuccessful G.E. takeover attempt. ''We were flailing,'' Mr. Cote said. ''We had a year and a half or two of crawling through mud.''
 Beginning in 2003, Mr. Cote has presided over $5.3 billion in acquisitions and $2.4 billion in divestitures. He said that he personally reviews any acquisition of $50 million or more and reviews progress at 30-, 60- and 90-day intervals, for example.
 ''That creates a real discipline for people to get things done,'' he said. 
 Honeywell's aerospace businesses are performing well, as are its automation and control-solutions division (think of your home thermostat) and its heating and ventilation unit. Profit in specialty materials and transportation have slipped. But its stock is up more than 28 percent this year.
 Mr. Tusa of JPMorgan says that the new conglomerates are making smarter M.& A. decisions.
 ''These companies have definitely acted in a more astute way in terms of return on invested capital and capital allocation decisions,'' he said. ''They're not just buying a company because it's accretive to earnings.'' 
 Textron's strong earnings result in part from a transformation of its internal management processes. Mr. Campbell says the company had 88 data centers when he started, but he consolidated them into two centers, then outsourced them. That set the stage for common engineering systems across the company's businesses, which include automation and control solutions, specialty materials and transportation systems, in addition to Cessna airplanes and Bell helicopters. 
 Mr. Campbell also changed the company's compensation system so that its top 1,000 employees are rewarded for how the whole company performs, not just for how their individual operating units fare.
 OUTSIDE analysts agree with the C.E.O.'s that the application of these standardized management processes across all their operating units has had a major impact.
 ''It is what makes the wholes worth more than the sum of their parts,'' says Michael Mankins, a partner at Bain & Company based in San Francisco. 
 Will the new conglomerates run out of gas if the global economic cycle shifts suddenly? Not likely, some analysts say. ''They are better positioned to weather the storm,'' Mr. Tusa said.
 The C.E.O.'s themselves are decidedly optimistic, of course. ''We're not at the end of the runway,'' said Mr. Campbell of Textron. ''We fully intend to double the value of the company every five years. We think we know how to do it.''

My Building, Held Hostage
 To the Editor:
 Another aspect of ''redevelopment'' (''Now You Own It, Soon You Don't?,'' July 29) is that a municipality can hold a property hostage for years. I own a building, where I conduct my business, in Long Branch, N.J. We've been in the ''redevelopment zone'' for 10 years! During this time my property has become virtually unsalable. 
 Buyers are reluctant to purchase properties located in redevelopment zones because of the potential for economic loss. Several times potential buyers have told me that because of the redevelopment designation they were not interested in my property. 
 This should, but probably won't, be addressed by the state Legislature.

 Lautenberg's Great. But Who's Next?
 To the Editor:
 In ''Lautenberg Strides On, Unfazed by Poll'' (July 15), I read that Senator Frank R. Lautenberg is contemplating a campaign for re-election next year, when he will be 84 years old.
 This is a good time to thank and praise Mr. Lautenberg for his outstanding career as a public servant, and as a great senator for New Jersey. One of the very best.
 It is also a time to look at the next generation of Democratic senatorial possibilities, to see who is most deserving of the honor of being Mr. Lautenberg's successor in the United States Senate.

 Violence and Newark: Not Synonymous
 To the Editor:
 In ''Wasted Decades'' (editorial, July 22) you present a litany of Newark's problems and then lament the fact that more (middle class) people are not moving into the city. After your negative descriptions, why would anyone in their right mind think of making a home in Newark?
 I have lived (happily, I might add) in Newark most of my adult life and have never seen an article or editorial in The Times concerning Newark that doesn't begin with a reference to the tragic civil disturbances that occurred here 40 years ago. 
 I'm concerned that all of the attention paid to 1967 further cements in people's minds a connection between Newark and violence and disorder. 
 A major ''problem'' for Newark, I believe, is your persistently negative reporting and editorializing about the city. Certainly there are serious problems in Newark as in all major urban areas, but there is more -- much more -- to the city than gangs, violence and poor schools.

HEADLINE: A Bad Deal Gets Worse

 BODY:
President Bush is understandably desperate for some kind of foreign policy success. But that cannot justify sacrificing his principled stand against weapons proliferation to seal a nuclear cooperation deal with India. The agreement could end up benefiting New Delhi's weapons program as much as its pursuit of nuclear power. 
 The deal was deeply flawed from the start. And it has been made even worse by a newly negotiated companion agreement that lays out the technical details for nuclear commerce. Congress should reject the agreement and demand that the administration, or its successor, negotiate a new one that does not undermine efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons. 
 Any agreement needs to honor the principle Mr. Bush set forth in 2004: that countries do not need to make their own nuclear fuel, or reprocess their spent fuel, to operate effective nuclear energy programs. The technology can be all too easily diverted to make fuel for a nuclear weapon. 
 Unfortunately, Mr. Bush's accord with India jettisoned that essential principle. Washington capitulated to India's nuclear establishment and endorsed continued reprocessing. And while United States law calls for nuclear cooperation to end if India detonates another weapon, the agreement makes no explicit mention of that requirement -- while it promises that Washington will acquiesce, if not assist, in India's efforts to find other fuel suppliers. 
 Bringing India -- which never signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -- in from the cold is not a bad idea. It is the world's most populous democracy, with a dynamic economy. And its record on nonproliferation -- aside from its own diversion of civilian technology to its once-secret weapons program -- is pretty good. The problem is that the United States got very little back. No promise to stop producing bomb-making material. No promise not to expand its arsenal. And no promise not to resume nuclear testing.
 The message of all this is unmistakable: When it comes to nuclear proliferation, Washington's only real policy is to reward its friends and punish its enemies. Suspicion of America's motives around the world are high enough. America cannot afford another such blow to its credibility, especially when it is trying to rally international pressure against nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea. 
 The administration will argue that altering this agreement now would be a slap at India. But there is no good in compounding a bad deal. And there are better ways to deepen political and economic ties. 
 Congress accepted the administration's arguments far too uncritically when it approved the first India-related nuclear legislation last December. It must now take a stand against the even more damaging companion agreement. At a time when far too many governments are re-examining their decision to forswear nuclear weapons, the United States should be shoring up the nuclear rules, not shredding them.

HEADLINE: Energy Bill Adopted by House Requires Utilities to Use Renewable Power Sources

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
The House passed a wide-ranging energy bill on Saturday that will require most utilities to produce 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar power. President Bush has vowed to veto the bill because it does nothing to encourage increased domestic production of oil and gas.
 ''It's a big, big deal,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a longtime member of the energy committee. ''There has been no legislation like this for a generation.'' 
 The energy measure passed by a vote of 241-172, with 26 Republicans voting in favor and 9 Democrats opposed. Speaker Nancy Pelosi had made the bill one of her top legislative priorities for her first year as leader of the House Democrats.
 The bill allots money for the development of alternative fuels and for increased efficiency of appliances and buildings. It is also meant to spur research on methods to capture the carbon dioxide emissions that scientists say are largely responsible for global warming.
 The House also passed a bill to repeal roughly $16 billion in tax breaks for the oil industry enacted in 2005. Some of the money would be used to pay for the research grants and renewable-fuel projects in the energy bill.
 The utilities provision, or the so-called renewable electricity standard amendment, was among the most contested measures in the energy bill. Sponsored by Representative Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, and several others, it will force utilities to make a significant share of their electricity from solar, wind, geothermal, water and other nonfossil fuel sources, although they can meet part of the requirement through conservation measures. 
 The standard applies only to investor-owned utilities and exempts rural electric cooperatives, municipal utilities, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the state of Hawaii from the mandate. 
 ''I think this was a great victory for the planet,'' Mr. Udall said. He noted that more than 30 Republicans had voted for the amendment and predicted that it would be part of any energy bill that reaches the president's desk later this year.
 Thomas Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, called the House vote ''very disappointing'' and said it would bring big rate increases to electricity customers. Mr. Kuhn noted that the Senate had failed to pass a similar provision and that its fate in a House-Senate conference committee this fall was uncertain.
 The 786-page House energy bill does not include an increase in fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks that supporters called the single most effective way of cutting oil consumption and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Sponsors vowed to bring it up again when Congress reconvenes in September.
 The Senate passed energy legislation in June with numerous differences from the House package. The Senate version requires that cars and light trucks sold in the United States achieve a fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020.
 Democrats said if the bill that emerged from conference contained both the renewable electricity standard and the mandate for higher corporate average fuel economy, it would be the most significant energy legislation ever enacted. 
 The bill the House passed on Saturday sets new requirements for energy efficiency in appliances and government buildings. It also contains billions of dollars in incentives for production of alternative fuels, new research on capturing carbon emissions from refineries and coal-burning power plants and training for workers in the ''green'' industries of the future.
 One of the bill's goals is that the federal government, the world's largest single energy consumer, be ''carbon neutral'' by 2050, meaning that all federal operations, including the Pentagon, would not produce a net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The bill does not specify how the government is to achieve this.
 Even if the major provisions of the House bill are enacted into law, consumers will experience few short-term effects, either in higher utility bills, more choices of fuel at the filling station or different vehicles on sale at their local car dealership. Those are longer-term goals.
 But Americans will soon light their houses differently. The bill outlaws the sale of 100-watt incandescent light bulbs by 2012 and requires that all bulbs be 300 times more efficient than today's ordinary bulbs by 2020.
 The White House expressed its opposition to the Democratic energy bills, saying they did not meet their stated goals of reducing oil imports, strengthening national security, lowering energy prices and beginning to address global warming. The White House also said the tax bill unfairly singled out the oil industry.
 Republican opponents of the measure echoed the White House position, saying that the package provided no new supplies of energy, would drive up fuel prices and provide billions in what they called ''green pork'' to support Democrats' pet environmental projects.
 ''It tells us to turn the lights out, that's what this bill does,'' said Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska. ''There is no energy in this bill at all.''
 Representative Joe L. Barton, who led the Republican opposition to the package on the House floor on Saturday, said the hours spent debating the bills had been wasted.
 ''This is really an exercise in sterile futility,'' Mr. Barton said, referring to the president's veto threat, ''because this bill isn't going anywhere.''
 Rancor from the partisan feuding of the week continued to resonate Saturday as Republicans sought a vote criticizing Democrats for deleting some remarks from The Congressional Record. The move was blocked by Democrats, leading Republicans to cry ''cover-up'' on the House floor.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 10, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about energy legislation approved by the House of Representatives incorrectly described a provision involving light bulbs. The measure requires that by the year 2020 all bulbs be three times more efficient than current ordinary bulbs; it does not require them to be 300 times more efficient.

HEADLINE: What's a Fed Chairman to Do?

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
PAUL VOLCKER faced a recession and double-digit inflation when he became chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1979. Alan Greenspan took over the Fed in 1987 and two months later ran into the worst market crash since the Depression.
 Now Ben S. Bernanke, who took the Fed chairmanship in February 2006, is facing his own problems. Compared with the crises that Mr. Volcker and Mr. Greenspan encountered, Mr. Bernanke's troubles are relatively minor, at least for now. After years of easy credit that fueled a boom in takeovers and mortgages, the debt markets have abruptly tightened. Consumers with weaker credit are paying higher rates for loans if they can get them. Businesses, too, find financing more difficult. 
 The end of cheap credit may be overdue. In the last few years, Wall Street has taken advantage of cheap money to make loans and finance takeovers that may not have made economic sense, said Robert DiClemente, chief United States economist for Citi -- formerly called Citigroup.
 ''At the core this is a healthy adjustment,'' Mr. DiClemente said.
 But the speed with which credit markets have tightened is unnerving, rippling through the financial markets for stocks and bonds and sending investors into retreat. ''I'm a little nervous that this could be a brush fire that could get out of hand,'' Mr. DiClemente said.
 The Fed meets on Tuesday, and Mr. Bernanke must decide whether to allow the credit crunch to play out on its own or to step in by lowering interest rates. 
 The right answer is not obvious, said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal policy group. William McChesney Martin, the Fed chairman from 1951 to 1970, memorably said, ''The job of the Federal Reserve is to take away the punch bowl just when the party starts getting interesting.''
 In other words, the Fed needs to set interest rates high enough to prevent the economy and markets from becoming overheated, but not so high that they dampen economic growth unnecessarily.
 The Federal Reserve's power over the economy and Wall Street can be overstated. The Fed cannot improve business productivity or force lawmakers to create sensible tax policies or make investors act prudently -- all important ingredients for long-run economic growth.
 But the Fed has vast influence over short-term swings in the economy through its control of interest rates. The short-term rates set by the Fed now stand at 5.25 percent annually. By lowering rates, the Fed makes borrowing easier, giving a boost to the economy.
 Raising rates has the opposite effect, slowing businesses, consumers, and investors if the economy appears to be in danger of overheating and igniting inflation. The Fed can also use regulations and jawboning to encourage or discourage banks from lending.
 The biggest blight on Mr. Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairman is the technology stock bubble of the late 1990s, which led to the plunge in the Nasdaq index between 2000 and 2002. Mr. Greenspan was partly at fault for that bubble, Mr. Bernstein said, because he allowed markets to believe that he would always make credit available if they ran into trouble.
 By taking a firm line in the current credit crunch, Mr. Bernanke can show investors that they cannot count on the Fed to save them from market swings, Mr. Bernstein said.
 ''This would be a good time for the Fed to impose some discipline on financial markets that we haven't seen in a while,'' he said.
 But, in an illustration of the fine line that Mr. Bernanke must walk, Mr. Bernstein said he hopes the Fed considers lowering interest rates this fall, not to help Wall Street and hedge funds, but to lower the risk of an economic slowdown that would hurt middle-income Americans. With core inflation, excluding food and energy, running under 2 percent annually, the Fed has room to lower rates, Mr. Bernstein said.
 In essence, Mr. Bernanke faces a choice of keeping credit relatively tight for now -- and thus reducing the risk of bubbles for years to come -- or loosening credit and lowering the chance of an economic slowdown in the next few months.
 Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, said he had little doubt what choice Mr. Greenspan would make if he were still in charge.
 ''Under Greenspan, my guess would be that the Fed would be already talking about priming the markets for a possible easing,'' Mr. Yardeni said -- through lowering of interest rates. ''Under Greenspan, there was a modus operandi where the Fed would respond to potential shocks to the economy even if they had low probabilities.''
 But Mr. Greenspan is not in charge anymore. Mr. Bernanke is, and he appears to be more inclined to allow the credit crunch to play out on its own, Mr. Yardeni said.
 If Mr. Yardeni's hunch about Mr. Bernanke is correct -- and most investors seem to believe that it is -- the Fed will keep short-term rates at their current levels for at least a couple more months.
 Is that strategy the right one?
 We'll know soon enough.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Mania Didn't Grip Everyone

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THE seized-up United States mortgage market claimed more victims both here and abroad last week. The American Home Mortgage Investment Corporation, once a big lender, closed its doors, laying off more than 6,000 workers. In Germany, IKB Deutsche Industriebank received a $4.8 billion bailout from a government-owned group that said it would cover potential subprime losses at the bank. 
 In a report last week, Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners, an independent research firm in New York, characterized the state of the mortgage market this way: ''Investors finally realized that there is such a thing as a bad mortgage loan. As a matter of fact, there is such a thing as a whole bunch of bad mortgage loans.''
 As a result, Mr. Peabody noted, investors are no longer interested in most of the risky loans that mortgage bankers have been creating lately. Bankers can sell only the highest-grade pieces of those wonderful securities pools that were so popular among investors until about five minutes ago. 
 That gives two choices -- neither one felicitous -- to the bankers who originated the low-grade loans. They can either sell them at a loss, reflecting the market's view of such debt, or hold them on their own balance sheets and watch them decline in value.
 It is never pretty, watching a mania come undone. Unless you are one of the folks who never bought into the madness in the first place. 
 Michael A. J. Farrell, chief executive of Annaly Capital Management, a high-grade mortgage real estate investment trust, is one such man. And with a perspective on the residential mortgage and credit markets extending back to the 1970s, he is an excellent person to consult on what is likely to happen next.
 Annaly is an investment management company that oversees a portfolio of strictly high-grade assets. The company invests solely in mortgages backed by government-sponsored entities like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Investors understand that it has little exposure to the current credit crunch and have bid up its shares almost 8 percent this year. The shares also pay a generous dividend of 6.4 percent at current prices.
 For his conservative approach, Mr. Farrell confirms that for about two years beginning in 2003, he took plenty of abuse from more aggressive counterparts in the industry and from potential investors who urged him to buy lower-quality assets for their greater returns. Some of those ridiculing Mr. Farrell were the same people who jeered at investors who did not get the new paradigm, espoused in 1999, that any-Internet-company-is-a-good-Internet-company.
 ''I definitely took heat not only in my professional life but in my personal life,'' Mr. Farrell said. ''I had people stop me on the street while I was walking my dog saying, 'Where is your dividend going?' '' 
 During the crazy years, Mr. Farrell and his team decided against increasing the size of Annaly's balance sheet. Investors willing to throw money into anything mortgage scoffed when the company turned them down. ''We decided to withdraw from the market until the end of 2005, when we thought investment risk was being recognized by the market,'' he said.
 Mortgage real estate investment trusts came public like weeds during the boom, of course. But the strategies they use can vary widely. Some originate mortgages -- New Century did, for example -- and others buy mortgage loans in the secondary market, whether risky or not. 
 Most mortgage REITs do a bit of everything, explained Jeremy Diamond, a managing director at Annaly. As a result, investors in these companies must rely on their managers to put the right emphasis on credit risk and interest rate risk at different periods in a business cycle. 
 But because Annaly shuns credit risk, its investors are trusting its managers to bet appropriately on interest rate risk only. In this they are also conservative, holding assets with a duration of six months to two years. They also have one-third of their portfolio in fixed-rate assets, with the rest in adjustable- and floating-rate assets; this allows the portfolio to work well whether rates decline or rise.
 ''There is no official Annaly interest rate forecast,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''We manage the portfolio with no significant directional bias because we could be wrong.'' 
 Annaly's biggest challenge comes when rates plunge, as they did in 2004, pushing mortgage holders to refinance. But it has reduced its exposure to refinancing risk in recent months by raising about $2.5 billion in capital and reducing the premium-priced mortgages in its portfolio. While the company paid an average of $102.50 per $100 worth of bonds in its portfolio in 2003, its average is now $100.50. 
 When the mortgage market started to regain some of its sense in 2006, Annaly began raising money from investors. It made two stock offerings in 2006 and two more this year. Each time, the deals carried a higher price tag, reflecting investors' appreciation of Annaly's conservative business model. Even those who bought into the company's most recent offering last month -- at $14 a share -- are ahead. Annaly's shares closed Friday at $14.98. 
 Mr. Farrell and other Annaly executives also align themselves with their investors by not taking performance fees as most REITs do. Instead, the executives' compensation, just 0.12 percent of assets under management, comes out of the company's revenues.
 So what does Mr. Farrell, who has been through at least three mortgage market seizures in his career, see on the horizon for the credit markets? More of the same turmoil, alas. 
 ''I look at this sort of like 1990 and 1991,'' he said, referring to the savings-and-loan crisis. ''Against that background you had a $7 trillion economy that gave birth to the $300 billion Resolution Trust Corp. Now we have an $11 trillion economy and we've already seen $2 trillion of market capitalization going away'' before many loans in the pools have actually defaulted, he said.
 WHAT about the people who argue that the impact of the mortgage mess will be muted because risks have been spread well beyond the banks and into many parts of the financial world? Mr. Farrell takes the opposite view. Spreading the risk beyond the banking system will make the task of fixing the mess much harder. 
 ''Even if the Fed eases, it is probably not going to help the housing market,'' he said. ''This repair cycle is going to take a lot longer because it is not concentrated in the banking system like it was in the 1990s. Back then, they could repair the banking system by dropping interest rates. Now they can't bail out rich hedge fund guys in Greenwich.''

HEADLINE: It's an Ad, Ad, Ad, Ad World

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
It is only a matter of time until nearly all advertisements around the world are digital. 
 Or so says David W. Kenny, the chairman and chief executive of Digitas, the advertising agency in Boston that was acquired by the Publicis Groupe for $1.3 billion six months ago.
 Now Mr. Kenny is reshaping the digital advertising strategy for the entire Publicis worldwide conglomerate, which includes agencies like Saatchi & Saatchi, Leo Burnett and the Starcom MediaVest Group and the global accounts of companies like Procter & Gamble, American Express, Hewlett-Packard and General Motors.
 The plan is to build a global digital ad network that uses offshore labor to create thousands of versions of ads. Then, using data about consumers and computer algorithms, the network will decide which advertising message to show at which moment to every person who turns on a computer, cellphone or -- eventually -- a television. 
 More simply put, the goal is to transform advertising from mass messages and 30-second commercials that people chat about around the water cooler into personalized messages for each potential customer. 
 ''Our intention with Digitas and Publicis is to build the global platform that everybody uses to match data with advertising messages,'' Mr. Kenny said. ''There is a massive transformation happening in the way consumers live and the data we have about them, but very few companies have stepped up to it yet.''
 Publicis announced last Tuesday an important step in its digital plan: the acquisition of the Communication Central Group, a digital agency in China founded in 1995, for an undisclosed amount. The agency, to be called Digitas Greater China, will give Publicis a foothold in the Chinese advertising market, which analysts within Publicis estimate is growing at about 20 percent a year, much faster than global growth in the market, which hovers around 5 percent a year.
 ''There's a chance to invest right now in China, India, Russia and Brazil, which will pay off big over the next five years,'' Mr. Kenny said. ''These economies are going to boom, and ads there are going to go directly to mobile and directly to the Internet.''
 Beyond the growth potential, Publicis executives see these economies as important sources of low-cost labor for a Digitas subsidiary called Prodigious, a digital production unit that works with all agencies in the Publicis Groupe. Prodigious already uses workers in Costa Rica and Ukraine to produce copious footage for companies like G.M. 
 Greater production capacity is needed, Mr. Kenny says, to make enough clips to be able to move away from mass advertising to personalized ads. He estimates that in the United States, some companies are already running about 4,000 versions of an ad for a single brand, whereas 10 years ago they might have run three to five versions. And he predicts that the number of iterations will grow as technology improves.
 The Publicis digital plan can be viewed as a reaction to the changes in how consumers live, but it is also a response to competition among Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. Publicis is trying to carve out a niche as a middleman between those online giants and the consumer brand companies that buy advertising. The role is not unlike the way agencies have long connected advertisers to offline media like television networks, newspapers and magazines.
 ''How do we see Google, Yahoo and Microsoft? It's important to see that our industry is changing and the borders are blurring, so it's clear the three of those companies will have a huge share of revenues which will come from advertising,'' said Maurice Levy, chairman and chief executive of the Publicis Groupe. 
 ''But they will have to make a choice between being a medium or being an ad agency, and I believe that their interest will be to be a medium,'' he added. ''We will partner with them as we do partner with CBS, ABC, Time Warner or any other media group.''
 Mr. Levy's view of the dominant Internet portals diverges from that of other advertising executives. Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP Group, another ad agency conglomerate, has publicly called Google a ''frenemy'' and has recently acquired 24/7 Real Media, an advertising network that positions his company to compete more directly with Google and other online portals. 
 Mr. Levy, who has a penchant for grand ambitions, says he does not plan to compete with Google -- rather, he wants Google to need Publicis. 
 He is widely credited with the transformation of Publicis from a small French ad company into one of the world's largest advertising holding companies, competing with the WPP Group, Omnicom and the Interpublic Group. Now his stated goal is to stir up the digital sea before he retires in 2010. 
 By Mr. Levy's account, the Publicis purchase of Digitas was the deal that set in motion a string of online acquisitions, as companies like Google, Microsoft and the WPP Group spent billions to buy the online advertising companies DoubleClick, aQuantive and 24/7 Real Media, respectively. Just last month, AOL purchased the behavioral ad network Tacoda.
 ''We took the initiative, and it has triggered a frenzy of acquisition in the industry,'' Mr. Levy said. ''It's something that can be checked by the date. It's quite clear we triggered it.''
 Digitas, like many digital agencies, started out as a direct marketing firm, reaching consumers mainly through the United States Postal Service. As the Internet emerged, Digitas developed a platform it calls Dashboards to break online ads into their components and figure out which pieces work for which audiences. 
 Digitas uses data from companies like Google and Yahoo and customer data from each advertiser to develop proprietary models about which ads should be shown the first time someone sees an ad, the second time, after a purchase is made, and so on. The ads vary, depending on a customer's age, location and past exposure to the ads. 
 Digitas executives say that consumers end up with a better experience -- even a service -- if the ads they are shown are relevant and new. 
 ''We now know how many times they've seen this ad, so stop annoying them,'' said Mark Beeching, executive vice president and worldwide chief creative officer of Digitas. ''The more you can standardize and automate in terms of making different versions, hallelujah. That money should be spent creating more content.''
 Along with automation, low-cost workers abroad will help create more versions of ads. The Publicis Groupe's new employees in China, gained through the CCG deal, are paid well by Chinese standards, said Neil Runcieman, former chief executive of CCG and now chief executive of Digitas Greater China.
 Mr. Kenny said that Digitas constantly struggles to find enough employees with the technical expertise to use complex data to slice and dice ads for companies like General Motors and Procter & Gamble. As Digitas invests in countries like China and India, he said, the Publicis Groupe will benefit from the global talent pool -- and perhaps create more demand for advertising in those countries.
 ''There's this rising tide of advertising in emerging economies,'' Mr. Kenny said. ''But we can also help it rise by sending jobs there.''

Digitas, a new unit of the advertising conglomerate Publicis Groupe, is developing a system that links a database of consumer information with its advertisements. The system can deliver thousands of custom ads, each aimed at particular consumers based on their Web habits, demographics and past interactions with the advertiser. Here are three versions of a G.M. online advertisment created by Digitas, highlighting some differences. (pg. C4)

HEADLINE: Immigration Is at Center Of New Laws Around U.S.

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
State legislatures, grappling with the failure of the federal government to overhaul the immigration laws, considered 1,404 immigration measures this year and enacted 170 of them, an unprecedented surge in state-level lawmaking on the issue, according to a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 Spurred by rising resentment in the country over illegal immigration and by the collapse of a broad immigration bill in the Senate in June, state legislators nationwide adopted measures to curb employment of unauthorized immigrants and to make it more difficult for them to obtain state identification documents like driver's licenses. 
 While the political tide ran generally against illegal immigrants, some states adopted measures to help them by protecting them from exploitation and by extending education and health care to their children. Fifteen states adopted laws intended to punish immigrant smugglers, especially if their victims were foreigners coerced into prostitution or other sexual commerce. 
 State lawmakers have introduced about two and half times more immigration bills this year than in 2006, and the number that have become law is more than double the 84 bills enacted last year, according to the conference, a nonpartisan organization that includes all the state legislatures. The report was scheduled to be released today. 
 ''States will act in a vacuum,'' said Leticia Van de Putte, a Democratic state senator from Texas who is the president of the conference this year. ''The states are stepping up to the plate and doing what they can, because not to act would be irresponsible.''
 Every state debated immigration issues, and 41 states adopted immigration laws. A large number of new laws cracked down on employers who hire illegal immigrants. The broadest measure was passed in Arizona and signed into law by Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, in July. Arizona employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants face suspension of their business license for the first offense and the permanent loss of their license for a second offense within three years. The law requires employers to verify the status of job applicants with a federal immigration database known as Basic Pilot. 
 ''The message loud and clear from our constituents was their frustration that the federal government has not taken the necessary action to secure the border,'' Timothy S. Bee, a Republican who is the president of the Arizona Senate, said in a telephone interview yesterday. 
 Tennessee made it a criminal offense, rather than a civil one, to ''recklessly employ'' an illegal immigrant, with fines up to $50,000. Several states passed laws denying state contracts to employers of illegal immigrants, and other laws barred those immigrants from collecting unemployment benefits. In all, 26 laws on employing immigrants were passed in 19 states -- covering the nation from Hawaii to Arkansas to Georgia -- with most of the measures intended to curb illegal immigrants' access to jobs.
 But in Illinois, lawmakers barred the state from requiring employers to verify job applicants through the Basic Pilot system. The legislators called the system unreliable and error-prone.
 Several states -- including Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana and Nevada -- passed new laws or hardened existing ones to bar illegal immigrants from obtaining driver's licenses. The toughest law was adopted in Louisiana, which now requires applicants' names to be checked against a federal immigration database as well as the Department of Homeland Security's terrorism watch list. 
 Eleven states enacted 15 laws on public benefits, most of them denying state assistance to illegal immigrants. In May, Minnesota passed a version of a federal law that makes illegal immigrants ineligible for most medical aid.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 18, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of errors in a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures, an article on Aug. 6 about new immigration laws inaccurately described laws in three states. In Tennessee, a law provided for administrative, not criminal, procedures against employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, including temporary suspension of their business licenses. The bill did not create a new criminal offense of recklessly employing illegal immigrants or any new fines for prohibited hiring. Louisiana required drivers license applicants presenting foreign passports as proof of identity to provide documents showing they are authorized to be in the United States for at least 180 days, or 60 days for agricultural workers. It did not require applicants' names to be checked against federal immigration or terror lists. Minnesota's ban on illegal immigrants receiving its general assistance medical care has not changed.

HEADLINE: Bellwether Mexico Election Goes Smoothly

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
Voters went to the polls on Sunday in Baja California to decide between a conservative economist from the president's party and a colorful tycoon who owns betting parlors and comes from a storied political family in the once dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. 
 Both candidates -- Jose Guadalupe Osuna Millan, 51, of the president's National Action Party, and Jorge Hank Rhon, 51, the PRI candidate and former mayor of this city -- ran campaigns promising to rid this economically vibrant state across from California and Arizona of the organized crime that has hampered its development and taken scores of lives in the past two years. 
 Despite dire warnings before the election that there would be fraud on both sides, the polling went forward with few problems or incidents, though some polling places opened late or not at all. 
 At 6:30 p.m., barely a half hour after polls closed, the National Action party chairman, Manuel Espino, and Mr. Osuna Millan appeared at a hotel to declare victory on the strength of three exit polls that, he maintained, showed him winning the race by between 4 and 6 percentage points. 
 Still, there were no official results and Mr. Hank did not concede defeat.
 A few voters complained to a local radio station that they witnessed PRI members trying to buy votes. And there were isolated reports of shots fired near polling places in the town of Rosarito, radio reports said. 
 In general, however, the voting was peaceful and turnout was low.
 Through the campaign, Mr. Osuna and his supporters never missed a chance to mention he had no links to organized crime, and to point out that Mr. Hank has been dogged by allegations of corruption and even murder, though he has never been charged.
 Ramon Oropeza, a civil engineer, said questions about Mr. Hank's past persuaded him to vote for the National Action Party. ''He has a very dark past,'' Mr. Oropeza said. ''Full of conflicts.''
 Mr. Hank has dismissed the allegations against him as lies and pointed to his record of giving the Tijuana police department the equipment it needs to fight crime.

HEADLINE: Food That Travels Well

BYLINE: By JAMES E. McWILLIAMS. 
James E. McWilliams is the author of ''A Revolution in Eating: How the Quest for Food Shaped America'' and a contributing writer for The Texas Observer.

 BODY:
Austin, Tex.
 THE term ''food miles'' -- how far food has traveled before you buy it -- has entered the enlightened lexicon. Environmental groups, especially in Europe, are pushing for labels that show how far food has traveled to get to the market, and books like Barbara Kingsolver's ''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life'' contemplate the damage wrought by trucking, shipping and flying food from distant parts of the globe. 
 There are many good reasons for eating local -- freshness, purity, taste, community cohesion and preserving open space -- but none of these benefits compares to the much-touted claim that eating local reduces fossil fuel consumption. In this respect eating local joins recycling, biking to work and driving a hybrid as a realistic way that we can, as individuals, shrink our carbon footprint and be good stewards of the environment. 
 On its face, the connection between lowering food miles and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions is a no-brainer. In Iowa, the typical carrot has traveled 1,600 miles from California, a potato 1,200 miles from Idaho and a chuck roast 600 miles from Colorado. Seventy-five percent of the apples sold in New York City come from the West Coast or overseas, the writer Bill McKibben says, even though the state produces far more apples than city residents consume. These examples just scratch the surface of the problem. In light of this market redundancy, the only reasonable reaction, it seems, is to count food miles the way a dieter counts calories. 
 But is reducing food miles necessarily good for the environment? Researchers at Lincoln University in New Zealand, no doubt responding to Europe's push for ''food miles labeling,'' recently published a study challenging the premise that more food miles automatically mean greater fossil fuel consumption. Other scientific studies have undertaken similar investigations. According to this peer-reviewed research, compelling evidence suggests that there is more -- or less -- to food miles than meets the eye. 
 It all depends on how you wield the carbon calculator. Instead of measuring a product's carbon footprint through food miles alone, the Lincoln University scientists expanded their equations to include other energy-consuming aspects of production -- what economists call ''factor inputs and externalities'' -- like water use, harvesting techniques, fertilizer outlays, renewable energy applications, means of transportation (and the kind of fuel used), the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed during photosynthesis, disposal of packaging, storage procedures and dozens of other cultivation inputs.
 Incorporating these measurements into their assessments, scientists reached surprising conclusions. Most notably, they found that lamb raised on New Zealand's clover-choked pastures and shipped 11,000 miles by boat to Britain produced 1,520 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per ton while British lamb produced 6,280 pounds of carbon dioxide per ton, in part because poorer British pastures force farmers to use feed. In other words, it is four times more energy-efficient for Londoners to buy lamb imported from the other side of the world than to buy it from a producer in their backyard. Similar figures were found for dairy products and fruit.
 These life-cycle measurements are causing environmentalists worldwide to rethink the logic of food miles. New Zealand's most prominent environmental research organization, Landcare Research-Manaaki Whenua, explains that localism ''is not always the most environmentally sound solution if more emissions are generated at other stages of the product life cycle than during transport.'' The British government's 2006 Food Industry Sustainability Strategy similarly seeks to consider the environmental costs ''across the life cycle of the produce,'' not just in transportation. 
 ''Eat local'' advocates -- a passionate cohort of which I am one -- are bound to interpret these findings as a threat. We shouldn't. Not only do life cycle analyses offer genuine opportunities for environmentally efficient food production, but they also address several problems inherent in the eat-local philosophy.
 Consider the most conspicuous ones: it is impossible for most of the world to feed itself a diverse and healthy diet through exclusively local food production -- food will always have to travel; asking people to move to more fertile regions is sensible but alienating and unrealistic; consumers living in developed nations will, for better or worse, always demand choices beyond what the season has to offer. 
 Given these problems, wouldn't it make more sense to stop obsessing over food miles and work to strengthen comparative geographical advantages? And what if we did this while streamlining transportation services according to fuel-efficient standards? Shouldn't we create development incentives for regional nodes of food production that can provide sustainable produce for the less sustainable parts of the nation and the world as a whole? Might it be more logical to conceptualize a hub-and-spoke system of food production and distribution, with the hubs in a food system's naturally fertile hot spots and the spokes, which travel through the arid zones, connecting them while using hybrid engines and alternative sources of energy? 
 As concerned consumers and environmentalists, we must be prepared to seriously entertain these questions. We must also be prepared to accept that buying local is not necessarily beneficial for the environment. As much as this claim violates one of our most sacred assumptions, life cycle assessments offer far more valuable measurements to gauge the environmental impact of eating. While there will always be good reasons to encourage the growth of sustainable local food systems, we must also allow them to develop in tandem with what could be their equally sustainable global counterparts. We must accept the fact, in short, that distance is not the enemy of awareness.

HEADLINE: Career Women In Japan Find A Blocked Path, Despite Equal Opportunity Law

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
Yukako Kurose joined the work force in 1986, a year after Japan passed its first equal opportunity law. Like other career-minded young women, she hoped the law would open doors. But her promising career at a department-store corporate office ended 15 years ago when she had a baby. 
 She was passed over for promotions after she started leaving work before 6:30 each evening to pick up her daughter from day care. Then, she was pushed into a dead-end clerical job. Finally, she quit.
 ''Japanese work customs make it almost impossible for women to have both a family and a career,'' said Ms. Kurose, 45, who now works for a polyester company. 
 Since the Equal Employment Opportunity Law was passed in 1985, women have become a common sight on factory floors, at construction sites and behind the wheels of taxis. But they have had much less success reaching positions of authority, which remain the preserve of gray-suited salarymen. 
 In 1985, women held just 6.6 percent of all management jobs in Japanese companies and government, according to the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency. By 2005, that number had risen to only 10.1 percent, though Japan's 27 million working women made up nearly half of its work force. By contrast, women held 42.5 percent of managerial jobs in the United States in 2005, the organization said.
 Experts on women's issues say outright prejudice is only part of Japan's problem. An even bigger barrier to the advancement of women is the nation's notoriously demanding corporate culture, particularly its expectation of morning-to-midnight work hours. 
 Government statistics show that many women drop out of management-track jobs when they reach their late 20s and early 30s and start having children. As Japan's birthrate rapidly declines and its population ages, there are growing concerns that Japan can ill afford to lose so much potential.
 ''If expected to work 15 hours a day, then most women will give up,'' said Kuniko Inoguchi, a former cabinet minister in charge of gender equality. ''Japan is losing half of its brainpower as it faces a labor shortage.''
 Even with cases of blatant discrimination, lawsuits remain rare because of a cultural aversion to litigation. Another big problem has been that the equal opportunity law is essentially toothless. Despite two revisions, the law includes no real punishment for companies that continue to discriminate. The worst that the Labor Ministry can do is to threaten to publish the names of violators, and the ministry has never done that. As a result, Japan ranks as the most unequal of the world's rich countries, according to the United Nations Development Program's ''gender empowerment measure,'' an index of female participation in a nation's economy and politics. The country placed 42nd among 75 nations surveyed in 2006 -- just above Macedonia and far below other developed nations like the United States, ranked 12th, and top-ranked Norway.
 ''It's a pathetic situation,'' said Kumiko Morizane, deputy director of the equal employment division in Japan's Labor Ministry. ''Even in Pakistan, where women cover their faces, they had a female prime minister.''
 But the painfully slow pace of change reflects ingrained social attitudes about gender roles. 
 Takako Ariishi, 36, experienced an extreme version of these roles when she grew up as the only child of the president of Daiya Seiki, a small manufacturer owned by her family that supplies gauges to Nissan.
 At first, her disappointed father cut her hair like a boy's and forbade her to play with dolls. When she had her first son 10 years ago, he fired her from the company and anointed the infant grandson as his successor.
 Still, Ms. Ariishi took over as president three years ago after her father died. She says she is the only woman in a group of some 160 heads of Nissan suppliers. The first time she attended the group's twice-annual meetings, she says she was asked to wait in a room with secretaries. 
 ''I still have to prove all the time that a woman can be president,'' says Ms. Ariishi, a trained engineer who wears a blue unisex factory worker's uniform in her office. 
 She says she goes home every evening at 7 to put her son to bed, but then returns to work. The burden of such long hours pushes most career-track women to quit before they reach management-level jobs. Midori Ito, president of the Action Center for Working Women, a national group that gives legal support to working women, said more than half of career-minded women quit by their early 30s, while others choose to remain single.
 One of those is Miiko Tsuda, 38. She said that because she worked until 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. every night at the office of a tutoring schooloperator, she has not had time to think about marriage. 
 And yet, Ms. Tsuda says she frequently feels discrimination. She says she earns 10 percent to 20 percent less than men her age. Younger male colleagues ask her and other women to push elevator buttons for them and serve tea. She also says just five women of the company's 300-some management employees are women, up from zero when she joined 17 years ago.
 Still, women's rights advocates say that the realities of Japan's shrinking population are slowly forcing change. They say the need to find talented workers has pushed a small but growing number of companies to make more efforts to hire women as ''sogo shoku,'' or career-track employees, in line for management. Some analysts estimate that about a quarter of career-track hires in recent years have been women.
 Some companies are taking small steps to nurture more female managers. Since quitting the department store in 2002, Ms. Kurose has headed the diversity development section at Teijin, a polyester maker based in Osaka. She organizes classes to train women for management, sets hiring targets and helps mothers returning from maternity leave find new positions in the company.
 Progress is slow: Only some 50 of Teijin's approximately 2,000 managers are women, but even that is an almost threefold increase from when Ms. Kurose joined the company, she said.
 Now, women's rights advocates are starting to argue that Japan must make more such efforts -- not just for the corporate good, but for survival. 
 They point to studies showing that nations with greater workplace participation, like the United States, actually have higher fertility rates. Advocates say this is because working women in other countries start having children earlier in life, while many who leave the work force do not do so until their 30s.
 ''Birthrates here are declining because of a lack of equality for women,'' said Ms. Inoguchi, the former minister. ''The population shortage is forcing a change in attitudes.''

HEADLINE: More Home Foreclosures Loom As Owners Face Mortgage Maze

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
In 2003, Dianne Brimmage refinanced the mortgage on her home in Alton, Ill., to consolidate her car and medical bills. Now, struggling with a much higher interest rate and in foreclosure, she wants to modify the terms of the loan.
 Lenders have often agreed to such steps in the past because it was in everyone's interest to avoid foreclosure costs and possibly greater losses. But that was back when local banks held the loans and the bankers knew the homeowners, as well as the value of the properties. 
 Ms. Brimmage got her loan through a mortgage broker, just the first link in a financial merry-go-round. The mortgage itself was pooled with others and sold to investors -- insurance companies, mutual funds and pension funds. A different company processes her loan payments. Yet another company represents the investors as the trustee.
 She has gotten nowhere with any of the parties, despite her lawyer's belief that fraud was involved in the mortgage. Like many other Americans, Ms. Brimmage is a homeowner stuck in foreclosure limbo, at risk of losing the home she has lived in since 1998. 
 As the housing market weakens and interest rates on adjustable mortgages rise, more and more borrowers are falling behind. Almost 14 percent of subprime borrowers were delinquent in the first quarter of 2007. Investors, fearful that these problems will hurt the overall economy, have retreated from the stock and bond markets, creating major sell-offs.
 And the very innovation that made mortgages so easily available -- an assembly line process known on Wall Street as securitization -- is creating an obstacle for troubled borrowers. As they try to restructure their loans, they are often thwarted, lawyers say, by strict protections put in place for investors who bought the mortgage pools. 
 This impasse could exacerbate the housing slump, pushing more homeowners into foreclosure. That would lead to a bigger glut of properties for sale, depressing home prices further.
 ''Securitization led to this explosion of bad loans, and now it is harder to unwind and modify them even where it is in the best interests of both the borrower and the investors,'' Kurt Eggert, an associate professor at the Chapman University School of Law in Orange, Calif., said in an interview. ''The thing that caused the problem is making it harder to solve the problem.''
 Creating difficulties is the complex design of mortgage securities. 
 Some homeowners have problems simply identifying who holds their mortgages. Others find the companies that handle their loan payments, known as servicers, are unresponsive, partly because modifying loans cuts into profits.
 Even if circumstances suggest fraud when a loan was made, lawyers say, the various parties protect each other by refusing to produce documents.
 Compounding the problem is a law stating that when a loan is passed to another party, that entity cannot be held liable for problems. 
 ''I don't think there is anything in the entire securitization process that is at all focused on the borrower's interest,'' said Kirsten Keefe, executive director of Americans for Fairness in Lending. ''Everything they do is, 'How are we going to make a profit, and how are we going to secure ourselves against risk?' ''
 The idea of pooling loans and selling them to investors dates back to 1970, but the practice has exploded in recent years. At the end of last year, $6.5 trillion of securitized mortgage debt was outstanding. 
 More than 60 percent of home mortgages made in the United States in 2006 went into securitization trusts. Some $450 billion worth of subprime mortgages, those made to borrowers with weak credit, went into securitizations last year. 
 Fifteen years ago, the last time the housing market ran into stiff trouble, government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae did most of the work pooling and selling mortgage securities. These enterprises readily agree to loan modifications. 
 But not so in the private issues pooled and sold by Wall Street, which has fueled the extraordinary growth in the market.
 The process begins with the entity that originates the loan, either a mortgage broker or lender. The loan is assigned to a company that will service it -- collecting borrowers' payments and distributing them to investors. Sometimes the servicer is affiliated with the lender, creating potential conflicts if a loan goes bad. 
 A Wall Street firm then pools thousands of loans to be sold to investors who want a steady stream of cash from loan payments. The underwriters separate them into segments based on risk. 
 Once a trust is sold, a trustee bank oversees its operations on behalf of investors. The trustee makes sure that the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement are met; this document determines what a servicer can do to help distressed borrowers. 
 The agreements require that any modifications to loans in or near default should be ''in the best interests'' of those who hold the securities. 
 But there is wide variation in how many loans can be modified. Some trusts have few curbs; others allow no more than 5 percent of mortgages to be changed.
 Some trusts limit the frequency with which a loan can be modified or dictate a minimum interest rate. The variations help explain why borrowers are having difficulty. 
 Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, says companies in the chain should be held responsible. ''Because Wall Street is responsible for the mess we are in, they need to bear some of that burden,'' Mr. Rheingold said. ''Why should people who have been funding these bad loans get a free pass?''
 For now, the burden falls on people like Ms. Brimmage, a former forklift driver at an Owens-Brockway Glass Container plant in Godfrey, Ill., that closed last fall. A borrower in good standing since 1998, she said a local broker persuaded her to combine her debts in a fixed-rate loan of $65,000 in 2003.
 But at the closing, she was presented with an adjustable-rate mortgage from the Argent Mortgage Company, carrying a low teaser rate for two years. When she objected, the broker assured her that rates would fall and she could get a better fixed-rate loan later. She said she believed him. 
 Rates did not fall. Still, Ms. Brimmage made her payments until illness struck in 2005. She then had difficulty paying the mortgage and liquidated part of her 401(k) retirement fund to keep current. Last September, she received a foreclosure notice from AMC Mortgage Services. Argent, which made the loan, and AMC are units of ACC Capital Holdings, a private company.
 Clarissa P. Gaff, a lawyer for Ms. Brimmage at the Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation, hopes to cut her client's loan and reduce the interest rate. The monthly payments have risen to $691 from $414, as the rate has jumped to 11.25 percent from the original 6.3 percent. 
 But the servicer has not agreed. Deutsche Bank, the trustee of the security holding the loan, says it is unable to help because it is neither the servicer nor the lender. 
 AMC Mortgage Services says Ms. Brimmage must pay the full amount. A spokesman for the company said that it had worked with her for two years and that it is in the interests of all involved in a mortgage to keep a loan current.
 Ms. Gaff said some documents indicate that the mortgage broker who arranged the loan may have violated truth-in-lending requirements. The broker's employer has been barred from doing business in Illinois and a handful of other states. 
 ''We have run into this in any number of cases,'' Ms. Gaff said. ''The bank that holds the note as trustee claims to have no information relating to the servicer or the loan originator in spite of the fact that documents show all the parties have been working together for ages. It insulates them from liability.'' 
 Imperiled homeowners are especially disadvantaged if they live in a state -- like Georgia, California, Texas and 18 others -- where foreclosures can take place without a judge's oversight. A loan servicer in these places can push for quick foreclosure, sometimes in 40 days. Fast turnarounds are in a servicer's interest because securitization pools do not cover the costs of modifying loans. 
 Lawyers trying to assist distressed homeowners sometimes find that these proceedings have been started without proof of ownership.
 ''There is some sort of confusion with regard to ownership in virtually each one of my subprime cases,'' said Howard D. Rothbloom, a lawyer in Marietta, Ga., who represents low-income people battling foreclosure. ''Securitization has made it so complicated that everyone in the process is able to say that they don't know what's going on. The effect is, no poor person can afford to litigate this type of matter to bring it to a resolution, and therefore they lose their home.''
 Mamie Ruth Palmer, an elderly woman in Atlanta, filed for bankruptcy in 2002 to stop a quick foreclosure sale. On Ms. Palmer's behalf, Mr. Rothbloom is suing the trustee, Bank of New York, as well as HomEq Servicing, which withdrew its registration to do business in Georgia last fall. Mr. Rothbloom argues that Ms. Palmer's lender levied improper costs, including $11,500 in legal fees.
 Ms. Palmer is still in her home and makes mortgage payments to a bankruptcy trustee, Mr. Rothbloom said, but he has been unable to reach a settlement. Her loan stands at $51,500.
 Bank of New York, like Deutsche Bank, says that the trustee's function is an administrative one and that it is not responsible for foreclosures. HomEq did not return a phone call seeking comment.
 Mr. Rothbloom said he has had cases where homeowners received foreclosure notices from entities that could not prove ownership. 
 ''I am sure there are a lot of people who are no longer living in their homes where there was a flawed foreclosure,'' Mr. Rothbloom said.

HEADLINE: Fearful of Restive Foreign Labor, Dubai Focuses on Reforms

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
They still wake before dawn in desert dormitories that pack a dozen men or more to a room. They still pour concrete and tie steel rods in temperatures that top 110 degrees. They still spend years away from families in India and Pakistan to earn about $1 an hour. They remain bonded to employers under terms that critics liken to indentured servitude. 
 But construction workers, a million strong here and famously mistreated, have won some humble victories. 
 After several years of unprecedented labor unrest, the government is seeking peace with this army of sweat-stained migrants who make local citizens a minority in their own country and sustain one of the world's great building booms. Regulators here have enforced midday sun breaks, improved health benefits, upgraded living conditions and cracked down on employers brazen enough to stop paying workers at all. 
 The results form a portrait of halting change in a region synonymous with foreign labor and, for many years, labor abuse.
 Many rich countries, including the United States, rely on cheap foreign workers. But no country is as dependent as the United Arab Emirates, where foreigners make up about 85 percent of the population and 99 percent of the private work force. From bankers to barbers, there are 4.5 million foreigners here, compared with 800,000 Emirati citizens, according to the Ministry of Labor. About two-thirds of the foreigners are South Asians, including most of the 1.2 million construction workers. 
 The labor agitation came as a surprise in this city of glass towers and marble-tiled malls where social harmony is part of the marketing plan and political action can seem all but extinct. But when thousands of migrant construction workers walked off the job last year, blocking traffic and smashing parked cars, it became clear that the nonnatives were restless.
 ''I'm not saying we don't have a problem,'' said Ali bin Abdulla Al Kaabi, the Emirates' labor minister, who was appointed by the ruling sheiks to upgrade standards and restore stability. ''There is a problem. We're working to fix it.''
 Change here is constrained by rival concerns of the sort that shape the prospects of workers worldwide. Like many countries, only more so, the United Arab Emirates needs the foreign laborers but fears their numbers. The recent focus on the workers' conditions still leaves them under close watch, segregated from the general population, with no right to unionize and no chance at citizenship.
 ''We want to protect the minority, which is us,'' Mr. Kaabi said. 
 Among those buffeted by recent events is Sami Yullah, a 24-year-old pipe fitter from Pakistan, who arrived four years ago. Like many workers, he paid nearly a year's salary in illegal recruiter's fees, despite laws here that require employers to bear all the hiring costs. In exchange, he was promised a job building sewer systems at a monthly salary of about $225, nearly twice what he earned at home.
 Mr. Yullah found the work harder and more hazardous than he had expected. Two co-workers were killed on the job, he said, and two others injured, when they fell through a manhole. Conditions at the workers' camp where he lived, rudimentary at best, disintegrated when his employer let the water and electricity lapse. Then a problem even more basic arose: the company stopped paying the workers.
 The owner kept saying, 'Wait a minute, I will get some money,' '' said Mr. Yullah, who joined about 400 co-workers last year in walking off the job. ''He was taking advantage of us.'' 
 In a break with past practice, Mr. Kaabi's Labor Ministry backed the workers. Tapping a company bank guarantee, it restored the camp utilities and paid some of the back wages. It barred the company, Industrial and Engineering Enterprises, from hiring more workers, leading it to close its Emirates operation. And it helped workers like Mr. Yullah, who is still owed nearly six months' back pay, find new jobs. 
 By global standards, punishing a company that does not pay its workers may seem modest, but Mr. Yullah recognized it as something new. 
 ''The company cheated me,'' he said. ''But the labor office is standing with the laborers.''
 The United Arab Emirates is a rags-to-riches story on a nation-state scale. Until the discovery of oil in the late 1950s, there was little here but Bedouins and sand. To extract the oil and build a modern economy, the rulers imported a multinational labor force that quickly outnumbered native Arabs.
 An ethos of tolerance has prevailed, with churches, bars and miniskirts co-existing with burqas. But the construction workers who build hotel rooms that rent for $1,000 a night and malls that sell shoes for $1,000 a pair live segregated lives outside of this prosperous, cosmopolitan world. 
 They rise before dawn in distant camps, work six days a week at guarded sites and return by bus with time to do little but eat or sleep. Their sheer numbers inspire unease. When the film ''Syriana'' was released here, the government cut a scene of violent labor protest. 
 Sonapur, a camp a half-hour's drive into the desert from Dubai, houses 50,000 workers and feels like an army base. Two- and three-story concrete-block buildings stretch across the horizon, throngs of South Asian laborers fill the streets and desert dust fills the air. Even at midnight the camp roars. Buses ferry workers to third-shift jobs. Earthmovers work the perimeter, breaking ground for more dorms.
 Building skyscrapers is inherently dangerous, especially in the heat. Until the government recently began insisting on summer sun breaks, one Dubai emergency room alone was reporting thousands of heat exhaustion cases each month. In a rare count, Construction Week, a local trade publication, canvassed foreign embassies and estimated that nearly 900 foreign construction workers died in 2004, though it could not say what percentage of the deaths were work-related.
 The government does not track job-related injuries and deaths, though it is required by law to do so.
 Standing on Sonapur's sand-blown streets, some workers count their blessings. ''The work here is no problem,'' said Dinesh Bihar, 30, whose $150 salary is four times what he made when he left India.
 Some workers count their debts. ''I was so eager to come to Dubai, I didn't ask questions,'' said Rajash Manata, who paid placement fees of nearly $3,800, thinking his salary would be six times higher than it is. ''I blame myself.''
 Some workers simply count the days until they see their families again. 
 ''Three years, four months,'' said Cipathea Raghu, 37, when asked how long it had been since he had seen his 10-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son. ''They're always saying, 'Daddy please, come, when will you come?' '' he said. 
 ''Tension, tension,'' he added, pointing to his heart.
 Several years of quickening protests, mostly over unpaid wages, peaked in March 2006, when hundreds of workers went on a rampage near the unfinished Burj Dubai, which is being built as the world's tallest building. Eight months later, Human Rights Watch, a New York-based advocacy group, accused the Emirates of ''cheating workers.'' 
 For a country courting tourists and investors -- and a free trade pact with the United States -- the report stung. ''If the U.A.E. wants to be a first-class global player, it can't just do it with gold faucets and Rolls-Royces,'' said Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director for Human Rights Watch. ''It needs to bring up its labor standards.''
 Mr. Kaabi, 39, took office in late 2004, with what he describes as a mandate to do just that, for ethical and practical purposes, a departure from the Labor Ministry's earlier focus on processing employer requests for more foreign hires. ''A healthy worker will provide more effective labor -- period,'' he said in an interview. 
 He created the summer sun breaks, from 12:30 to 3 p.m. He pledged to increase the number of inspectors to 1,000, from roughly 100, though progress has been slow. And he publicly punished companies caught failing to pay their workers.
 The most notable action involved the Al Hamed Development and Construction Company, which was run by a well-connected sheik. After hundreds of workers blocked traffic in Dubai, Mr. Kaabi ordered the company to pay nearly $2 million in fines and temporarily froze the company's ability to hire new workers.
 ''A beautiful message was sent: everybody follows the rules,'' Mr. Kaabi said. 
 Acting separately, the emirate of Abu Dhabi has strengthened health benefits and subsidized what is meant to be a model labor camp. Still much about the workers' lives remains unchanged, including the frequent need to pay high recruiting fees. Mr. Kaabi said that practice was hard to police, since it often occurred in the workers' home countries. Workers remain tied to specific employers and cannot, without permission, change jobs. And unions remain off limits. Mr. Kaabi said allowing unions would give foreign labor bosses a chokehold on the economy.
 ''God forbid something happens between us and India and they say, 'Please, we want all our Indians to go home,' '' he said. ''Our airports would shut down, our streets, construction. No. I won't do this.''
 In July, the government ended a four-day strike at a gas processing plant by sending in the armed forces. There continue to be press accounts of worker suicides. 
 Faced with complaints about low wages and difficult work, Mr. Kaabi repeats a point often made here: Many workers face greater hardships at home for less pay. ''We don't force people to come to this country,'' Mr. Kaabi said. ''They're building a whole new life for their families.'' Some come from backgrounds so impoverished, he said, ''they don't know how to use the toilet; they will sit and do it on the ground.''
 But Ms. Whitson of Human Rights Watch said, ''That's what exploitation is -- you take advantage of someone's desperation.'' 
 Perched bare-chested on his bunk after a day in the sun, Sadiq Batcha, an 18-year veteran of labor camp life, was of two minds about the recent militancy. ''People who did strikes were justified to a certain extent,'' he said.
 At the same time, Mr. Batcha, 40, said his monthly salary of $250 was more than twice what he could make back home in an Indian fishing village. He had built a house, given his sister a dowry of $2,500, allowing her to marry, and sent his children to a private, English-speaking school. ''If strikes are made legal, the company will lose money, and eventually we'll lose our jobs,'' he said.
 Then with his eyes heavy at 9:30 p.m., Mr. Batcha excused himself. An alarm would sound in six hours and he was eager for sleep.

HEADLINE: In Debate, Republicans Make the Case for Staying in Iraq

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The leading Republican presidential candidates said yesterday that the military escalation in Iraq appeared to be restoring stability, and they berated their Democratic counterparts for advocating an end to American involvement there.
 Gathered for a debate in Des Moines, the Republican field offered a clear contrast with Democrats who, in a debate the day before, declared the troop escalation a failure and advocated a withdrawal. Most of the Republicans pointed to some early evidence of success in Iraq in arguing that it would be a mistake to abandon the war.
 ''They are making progress, and we are winning on the ground,'' said Senator John McCain of Arizona. ''We must win. And we will not set a date for surrender, as the Democrats want us to do.''
 The debate, on the ABC news program ''This Week,'' highlighted differences among the candidates on the issues of health care, abortion rights and spreading democracy around the world. 
 But the Republicans were more apt to attack Democrats than one another -- in particular Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, for saying that he would be willing to negotiate with leaders of hostile nations without any preconditions and that he would dispatch troops to Pakistan to search for terrorist camps if the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, failed to take action.
 ''In one week he went from saying he's going to sit down, you know, for tea, with our enemies, but then he's going to bomb our allies,'' said Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. ''I mean he's gone from Jane Fonda to Dr. Strangelove in one week.''
 On Iraq, only one candidate, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, advocated a withdrawal. ''We're losing this one,'' Mr. Paul said. ''We shouldn't be there. We ought to just come home.''
 But over all, the candidates were adamant about continuing the fight. ''The reality is that you do not achieve peace through weakness and appeasement,'' said Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York. 
 Mr. Romney said: ''I think we're pretty much in the same place. It is critical for us to win this conflict. It is essential, and that's why we're going to continue to pursue this effort.''
 Iowa has been teeming with activity by Republicans over the past week, both in anticipation of the debate and in preparation for next Saturday's Republican straw poll in Ames, an early test of organizational strength. Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani have pulled out of that contest, but Mr. Romney has invested major resources.
 Hinting at potential skirmishes as the straw poll approaches, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas criticized Mr. Romney as having shifted his position on abortion as he moved from being governor of Massachusetts to running for president. Mr. Brownback's campaign has been calling Iowa Republicans in recent days to remind them that Mr. Romney once supported abortion rights.
 ''There's one word that describes that ad, and it's 'truthful,' '' Mr. Brownback said in the debate, referring to the calls.
 Mr. Romney looked sternly toward Mr. Brownback and denounced the calls. ''I never said I was pro-choice, but my position was effectively pro-choice,'' he said, referring to the policies he advocated as governor. ''I've said that time and time again. I changed my position.'' 
 ''I get tired of people that are holier than thou because they've been pro-life longer than I have,'' Mr. Romney said.
 For the most part, the candidates made little effort to distance themselves from President Bush and Republicans in Congress, reflecting how they are trying to appeal to a decidedly conservative electorate that will vote in the caucuses here. All said they did not support legislation sponsored by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, that would expand insurance coverage for poor children by raising the tax on cigarettes -- a measure that the White House said Mr. Bush would veto.
 But Mr. Romney took aim at Mr. Giuliani's recent proposal to offer people $15,000 in tax deductions to help them buy health insurance. ''We have to have our citizens insured, and we're not going to do that by tax exemptions, because the people that don't have insurance aren't paying taxes,'' he said.
 Mr. Giuliani countered, arguing that the best way to increase the number of people with private insurance was to give them the deduction to encourage them to buy policies. ''They'll have an incentive to own their own health insurance,'' he said.
 In response to questions, the candidates said they would not support raising the gasoline tax to finance spending on the nation's roads and bridges in response to the collapse of the bridge in Minneapolis last week. Mr. Giuliani got into a terse exchange with his questioner, David Yepsen, the political columnist for The Des Moines Register, when Mr. Yepsen tried to ask him the question.
 ''David, there's an assumption in your question that is not necessarily correct, sort of the Democratic, liberal assumption, 'I need money; I raise taxes,' '' Mr. Giuliani said.
 ''Then what are you going to cut, sir?'' Mr. Yepsen responded. Mr. Giuliani said that as mayor of New York, he had increased revenues to pay for bridge and road repair by cutting taxes, thereby jolting the economy, and that he would do the same thing as president. The city's treasury in that period was flush largely with revenues produced by the stock-market boom of the late 1990s.
 Both Mr. Romney and, to a lesser extent, Mr. Giuliani criticized Mr. Obama for a speech in which he threatened to send American troops into Pakistan without that nation's approval. But later, under questioning, both said that as president they would keep open that very option, although they said Mr. Obama had been imprudent to raise the prospect of invading an ally.
 ''That is an option that should remain open,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''I believe the senator didn't express it the right way. I think the senator, if he could just say it over again, might want to say that we would encourage Musharraf to allow us to do it if we thought he couldn't accomplish it.''
 A spokesman for Mr. Obama, Bill Burton, said: ''The fact that the same Republican candidates who want to keep 160,000 American troops in the middle of a civil war couldn't agree that we should take out Osama bin Laden if we had him in our sights proves why Americans want to turn the page on the last seven years of Bush-Cheney foreign policy.''

HEADLINE: As Franchise Moves In, A Block's Loyalties Lie With the Local Guy

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
There really is a John inside Johnny's Pizza in Sunset Park, Brooklyn -- John Miniaci Jr., whose father, John Sr., founded the neighborhood pizzeria in 1968. 
 There will soon be another John right next door on Fifth Avenue -- Papa John's Pizza, a franchise outlet. John Jr. considers this as an insult to his own papa John, who died just one month ago. Of all the spots the franchise could have chosen, why, he asks, did it have to be on the other side of the wall where two centurion busts stand guard above customers waiting for zeppoles or Sicilian slices?
 ''This is a neighborhood that has had businesses in the same family for two and three generations,'' Mr. Miniaci said. ''These big corporations come in and don't see the value of that.'' 
 That's why Johnny's latest delivery is a petition -- to Papa John's corporate headquarters in Kentucky. Some 2,200 people -- shopkeepers and customers, including other pizzeria owners -- have come to Mr. Miniaci's defense. They have signed a declaration ''to stop the establishment of Papa John's in our neighborhood.''
 This Brooklyn community has been grappling to maintain its character in the face of impersonal economic and residential development. The storefronts along Fifth Avenue near 58th Street have long been home to mom-and-pop stores and restaurants, patronized by the working families who live in the brownstones on narrow side streets. The stores have awnings that announce ''Decent Dental Services'' or ''Spanish and American Food.''
 Many were here when the area was down on its luck and real estate values were low, and are determined to keep the neighborhood's traditional feel, even as they see chain stores and fast-food franchises creeping in. 
 They met Saturday to discuss how they can have a say in the way Sunset Park changes.
 ''I feel like this is the neighborhood's last stand,'' said Ivette Cabrera, a founding member of the Sunset Park Alliance of Neighbors, a new group that forced a proposed high-rise apartment building to scale back. Papa John's, she said, ''just came in right next to Johnny's and planted itself right in the face of everything that is Sunset Park.''
 Sandeep Singh, a 23-year-old immigrant from India who invested tens of thousands of dollars in the pizza franchise (his second), said he meant no disrespect and that he, too, was a small business owner. He insisted he was not there to run Johnny's out of business.
 ''Yes, we share a wall, but we are not selling what Johnny sells,'' said Mr. Singh, who is known as Sunny. ''Johnny should not be concerned. It's not a big deal. The people who come to Johnny's now will keep coming to Johnny's.'' 
 Chris Sternberg, a spokesman for Papa John's, based in Louisville, Ky., said the company approved the franchise after studying local demographics and being assured that Mr. Singh's franchise would be viable. It took Mr. Singh more than a year to find a storefront, which he finally rented from a landlord who owned a pizzeria himself. (About 10 blocks away, however.)
 His franchise will deliver to customers who live as far as 1.3 miles away when it opens in December, Mr. Singh said. 
 ''And you can order online,'' he said.
 So what else is new? Johnny's customers have been standing on line to order since the place opened. 
 At midday last Wednesday, local supermarket workers and grandmothers with children in tow waited to order at Johnny's. They greeted the men behind the counter with a smile, settling into chairs that were a tight fit for some of the more established customers.
 ''This is the best pizza in the area,'' said Roger Ramos, a postal worker who grew up nearby. ''Papa John's is just generic. Why are they coming here? Greed? I don't know.''
 As the lunchtime line grew, Rocco Coluccio prepared another pie, ladling the tomato sauce in generous circles, his back turned to the customers like a Miles Davis of marinara.
 Mr. Coluccio started working at Johnny's when he was 16, after visiting a friend who worked there. He wound up marrying the boss's daughter, Maria, and is now a co-owner with John Jr. Pizza has been good to him; his oldest son used to work there in the summer, but now goes to college and studies business.
 ''Me, as a businessman, I think this corporation has no respect, no class,'' Mr. Coluccio said. ''I'm not scared Papa John will have better pizza. It's just the way they're doing it. It's like they came to your house and kicked you right out.'' 
 The Papa John's will be the fourth pizzeria within three blocks, which worries Mr. Miniaci. Though cheese prices are rising, he has decided to keep slices at $2, until he knows what will happen next door.
 His customers -- some of whom traveled to Staten Island for his father's wake -- ask how he is doing. They keep signing the petition, too, which he keeps on the counter, right above the mozzarella sticks. Behind him, his father's face looks down from a prayer card. John Sr., who handed over the business to his son 14 years ago, died of heart failure July 5, after struggling with a bad heart for years.
 ''I knew about the Papa John's before he died,'' John Jr. said. ''But I never told him. The way he was, he would've died sooner.''
 Some of Johnny's competitors who signed the anti-Papa John's petition are not taking the news any better. For years they worked in friendly rivalry, helping each other through tight spots.
 ''If we get short on cheese or tomatoes, we go to him or he comes to us,'' said Gino Campese, the owner of Scotti's Pizza. ''When it's time to raise prices, we get together. There's room for everybody. But not for Papa John's.''

HEADLINE: Stairs to Remain Intact In Ground Zero Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The Spitzer administration says it has taken steps to finally solve the quandary of the ''survivors' stairway'' at ground zero. 
 By that, it means every step -- all 38 of them. Together.
 Gov. Eliot Spitzer's chief of downtown redevelopment, Avi Schick, proposes to keep the stairway whole and intact -- but just the seven-foot-wide stairway proper, not the hulking concrete structure around it.
 Held together and supported by a specially designed truss, the stairs would be moved out of the way of the planned 2 World Trade Center office tower. Eventually, they would be set into a long flight of steps leading from the visitors' center at ground zero to the underground World Trade Center memorial museum, which is to open in 2009. 
 The stairway served as an escape route on 9/11 and is the only aboveground remnant of the original trade center complex still in place. It stands near Vesey Street, on part of the site where Tower 2 is to rise.
 For months, preservationists, survivors of the attack, neighbors, officials and development executives have fought over how much of this ragged but evocative structure ought to be saved and where it ought to end up.
 Advocates have portrayed the stairway as a haunting symbol of the resilience, heroism and sheer good luck of those who found a tortuous way to safety on Sept. 11, 2001. Some expressed the hope that the entire structure would be preserved in place. Critics have dismissed the stairway as an obstruction and an eyesore that lost much of its meaning when it was badly damaged -- not by the attack, but during the recovery and cleanup. Some just wanted it torn down.
 Under the Pataki administration, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation proposed to disassemble the stairway, leaving some granite stair treads in their original location, but reoriented within the staircase to the lobby of Tower 2. The bottommost tread was to have been moved off and set into the memorial plaza. Other treads might have been used within the memorial museum. 
 Under the Spitzer plan, visitors would walk alongside the survivors' stairway during their descent into the museum. 
 ''They're experiencing the path of travel just as someone else experienced it,'' said Mr. Schick, who is the president of the Empire State Development Corporation, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and a director of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation.
 In an interview on Thursday, he said: ''The stairs are a potent reminder of the path to salvation and survival that many people had. We were able to separate what the stairs mean from what the structure means.''
 He added, ''The plan we walked into was an embarrassment to government.'' 
 Though the larger structure around the stairway would not be preserved, Mr. Schick said some elements would be salvaged, perhaps most important the granite landing at the top, which would be set into the memorial plaza.
 The new proposal must undergo scrutiny in a federal preservation review known as the Section 106 process, which covers historical resources affected by projects financed with federal money, as is the case at ground zero.
 There is no guarantee that the latest proposal will ultimately be adopted. But two leaders of the fight to save the stairway said on Friday that they were pleased with the plan.
 ''Obviously, we would have loved to see the staircase above ground,'' said Peg Breen, the president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy. ''But Avi Schick and the Spitzer administration put an enormous amount of thought into coming up with a respectful solution. I think they achieved it. There will be stairs, not just treads, and the museum will work to interpret them. The earlier proposal just chopped it into shreds, essentially.''
 Richard Zimbler, the vice president of the World Trade Center Survivors' Network, said the Spitzer administration's proposal would do justice to the structure's symbolic value. He added that he was confident the museum would successfully display the stairs and explain their context. 
 ''The most important elements of the stairway are those parts that look like a stairway,'' he said. ''And that's exactly the proposal: to preserve all the steps.''

HEADLINE: Putting the Clamps on Credit

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Jenny Anderson and Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The day-to-day financial dealings of Oneida Limited, the dinnerware and flatware maker, are typically about as far removed from the mortgage loan business as they can be.
 Yet, like the proverbial flapping of a butterfly's wings that sets off a storm thousands of miles away, the turmoil in the home mortgage market this summer directly affected the fortunes of the company, based in upstate New York, when it was forced to withdraw a planned offering of $120 million in high-yield bonds to investors as the credit markets froze up seemingly overnight.
 If the deal had been offered just a month earlier, said Andrew G. Church, Oneida's chief financial officer, the company would have had no trouble raising the money. ''But it happened so quickly,'' he said. ''We've never seen anything as quick as this.'' 
 The sudden change in the financial atmosphere is emerging as the toughest test yet for Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. While the Fed is not expected to alter short-term interest rates at its monetary policy meeting today, Mr. Bernanke is being pressed by many on Wall Street to emulate his predecessor Alan Greenspan and quickly open the door to a future rate cut. But others argue that he should resist any easing and let the market sort out the winners and losers rather than help bail out troubled borrowers and lenders. 
 On any given day, investor attention and headlines this summer have focused on the wild gyrations in the stock market or the free fall in the riskier parts of the mortgage bond market, which has led to the demise of numerous home lenders and a few hedge funds.
 Yesterday was no different as Wall Street had another roller coaster day and the Dow Jones industrial average erased Friday's losses with a nearly 287-point gain to close the session at 13,468.78. 
 But behind all the volatility what has been happening in recent weeks is the virtual seizing up of nearly the entire spectrum of the credit markets -- from mortgage-related securities to high-yield bonds and even European corporate debt.
 ''The liquidity in the credit markets was abysmal,'' said William H. Gross, chief investment officer of the bond management firm Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco. ''On Friday afternoon, the brokers were unwilling to make markets in almost anything that didn't have a Treasury or agency sticker attached to it. That's pretty bad.''
 The trading-in-a-vacuum phenomenon is only the latest evidence of how the days of easy, cheap money for corporations and individuals alike have disappeared. The ripple effect is being felt by nearly everyone. 
 Home buyers are paying more for mortgages. Mortgage lenders are closing shop as large banks turn off the spigot of money to them. Large and small corporations are also paying more to borrow -- if they can find anyone willing to lend them cash. The same goes for flashy private equity firms, which have curbed their deal making and forced their bankers to scramble to drum up loan packages for buyouts already in the works.
 In this bond market rout, debt instruments have had billions of dollars of value wiped out in just a few weeks. By some estimates, the high-yield market alone has lost nearly $50 billion in value since early June. Others say losses in the less easily traded mortgage- and asset-backed securities markets could easily run in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
 Paradoxically, the turmoil in the credit markets comes against the backdrop of relatively decent advances in economic growth and fairly robust corporate profit growth. The default rates on corporate debt remain well below average levels for the past decade.
 ''Either this is the start of something really bad and we are heading toward a recession,'' said Joseph M. Balestrino, fixed-income market strategist at Federated Investors, ''or it is an emotional reaction and creating a lot of opportunity in a lot of asset classes.''
 In Washington, the Bush administration is cautioning that the recent volatility in bond and stock markets is no cause for alarm because of the underlying strength of the American economy and because recent market declines should be thought of as an adjustment to past lending excesses. 
 ''We have the strongest global economy I've seen in my business lifetime,'' Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said in Beijing last week. ''We have a healthy economy in the U.S. So what is going on in my judgment is a reassessment of risk.''
 The Treasury chief has sounded that upbeat note since the beginning of the recent market turmoil. But the administration may try to go further in soothing investors nerves tomorrow, when President Bush visits the Treasury Department for a long-scheduled annual meeting on the economy.
 Whatever the future holds, many say what is leading this debt meltdown is the recognition that credit in recent years had simply become too cheap and too accessible for far too many individuals, hedge funds, private equity firms and corporations. 
 Indeed, many are convinced that the fallout in the mortgage market will continue as billions of dollars in mortgages reset to higher rates, starting this fall.
 Home borrowers are likely to have fewer options as many lenders continue to struggle. Yesterday , American Home Mortgage, once the nation's 10th-largest lender, declared bankruptcy, while two other lenders suspended making new loans to consumers.
 As for Wall Street, questions are rising about the billions of dollars in loans numerous banks and brokerage firms have guaranteed to buyout firms to complete planned acquisitions of companies. 
 When investors steered clear of the $12 billion in loans that banks were trying to sell to finance the buyout of Chrysler, the banks and brokerage firms wound up putting that debt on their books. By some estimates, financial institutions have committed themselves to issuing $200 billion to $300 billion in financing to allow buyouts already in the pipeline to go through.
 Major financial institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, which were among the biggest lenders to private equity firms, have enormous balance sheets to help them weather the storm. But smaller investment banks may be seriously thrown off course; already, according to insiders, they are becoming more careful about deploying capital elsewhere.
 ''There's a big problem right now with unsold financing for leveraged buyout commitments that the brokerage firms have to work off and that is discouraging them from actively providing liquidity into the high-yield market,'' said Marty Fridson, publisher of Leverage World, a research service that focuses on high-yield debt. 
 The gap between prices for high-yield corporate debt and Treasury securities in early June traded at a historic low, suggesting that investors saw little more risk in owning the debt issued by companies with blotchy credit histories than in government-issued debt. In a matter of weeks, that spread has more than doubled. 
 ''We knew it would have to reprice to reality,'' said Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income strategist with Lehman Brothers. ''But we've moved from reality to high anxiety.''
 That fear of taking on further risk has translated into fewer bonds being offered into the market. 
 High-yield bond offerings fell off a cliff last month. In July, only $2.4 billion in junk bonds were issued, a steep decline from the $22.4 billion that came to market in June, according to Thomson Financial. 
 High-quality bonds issued by companies with sterling credit have not been immune to the rout either. Investment-grade bond issues fell to $30.4 billion in July -- the lowest monthly total in five years -- from $109 billion in June, according to Thomson.
 For all the turmoil, some are confident that the credit market door will not stay shut for long. Despite withdrawing a $215 million bond sale late last month, Silverton Casino Lounge said it hoped to return to the markets very soon.
 ''We'll wait for a better time,'' Silverton's president, Craig Cavileer, said. ''We anticipate this is more of a short-lived sentiment.''

HEADLINE: Free Market Comes With a Dark Side

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Reading that a match last week involving the highly ranked Russian Nikolay Davydenko is under investigation by men's professional tennis after betting irregularities, I was reminded of a few wild, high-risk rides I happened to take a few years ago.
 Reporting on a story in 2002 about the unlikely (and brief) rise of a young basketball player named Nikoloz Tskitishvili from virtual unknown to fifth pick in the N.B.A. draft, I found myself in the back seat of a Dodge Durango as it tore through the streets of Tbilisi in the Republic of Georgia, treating red lights and other traffic protocols as unheeded suggestions. 
 At the wheel was a burly fellow named George, introduced as an investigator for the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and apparently moonlighting as the driver for a sports agent named Zurab Bokolishvili.
 With a shaved head and a closet of finely tailored suits, and boasting of offices and clients in Tbilisi and Moscow, Bokolishvili played host to a couple of American journalists, who, cowering in the back seat, could not help wondering about Georgian rules of the road.
 ''No problem for us,'' Bokolishvili said, laughing, an assurance that this was what passed for expert driving or a boast that influential men with handguns in their waistbands need not worry about potential consequence.
 Were power and a sense of invulnerability the residuals of new capitalist success, or the inevitable result of men with connections in all the right, or wrong, places? 
 We never did put the pieces of that puzzle together. But an American sports agent, who had lived and worked in Russia, later told me that organized crime and illegal gambling can blend seamlessly with the sports culture in the kind of developing economies and democracies that have become major contributors to the pro tennis circuits.
 Although no tennis scandal has exploded with the force of the continuing case of the former N.B.A. referee Tim Donaghy, there has been smoke in recent years around well-known Russian players. In 2003, betting on a Yevgeny Kafelnikov match in Lyon, France, was suspended when an ominously large wager was made on his opponent, Fernando Vicente, loser of his previous 12 matches. 
 Vicente won in straight sets. Kafelnikov, a former world No. 1, retired a year later to try his hand at professional poker.
 In 2002, Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov, a Russian with suspected mob ties, was accused by the F.B.I., working with Italian authorities, of fixing figure skating competitions at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. What did he have to do with tennis? Nothing, until he showed up in a photo on the Web site of the Ukranian player Andrei Medvedev, with his arms around Medvedev, Kafelnikov and another Russian, Marat Safin. 
 That brings us to Sopot, Poland, where Davydenko, ranked No. 4 in the world, took the first set, 6-2, from the 87th-ranked Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina. At that point, money on Arguello poured into a British online gambling company, raising the odds on Davydenko and the overall amount bet to 10 times the average amount.
 ''The price movement on this was just not what you would expect of a free market where observers were making judgments on the basis of what was happening in front of their eyes,'' Mark Davies, the communications director for the betting company, Betfair, wrote yesterday in an e-mail message. 
 Other than a couple of first-round defeats by Davydenko in previous weeks, it did not make sense to Betfair that such a heavy betting volume would go in Arguello's direction when he was losing the match.
 ''In the interests of integrity and fairness, we felt that we had to void the market,'' Davies wrote. And per its agreement with the Association of Tennis Professionals, Betfair notified the Tour, which opened its investigation after Davydenko retired with a foot injury in the third set.
 Even gamblers were suspicious, according to the log of an online bettors' forum called The Punter's Lounge. One poster to the forum, noting the odds swing, wrote during the second set, ''It does look for all the world like the fix is in.'' Several chimed in that Davydenko had not been a trusted competitor for some time.
 Take the ramblings of anonymous online gamblers for what they are worth, but they are out there, wirelessly connected, looking for that score. When Etienne de Villiers, the ATP's executive chairman, noted in a statement that tennis was a ''one-on-one gladiatorial contest,'' he was saying, in effect, that his sport was even more vulnerable to what N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern would call a ''rogue, isolated criminal.''
 Not to say Davydenko is that. All he is, pending an investigation, is a slumping star with an aching foot. But as the free-market sports world expands, so, too, does the underworld. In many places, where change is occurring at breakneck speed, it is not always easy to tell the difference.

HEADLINE: Bridge Collapse Revives Question About Spending

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY and JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Susan Saulny reported from Minneapolis, and Jennifer Steinhauer from Los Angeles.

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
In the past two years, Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota twice vetoed legislation to raise the state's gas tax to pay for transportation needs.
 Now, with at least five people dead in the collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge here, Mr. Pawlenty, a Republican, appears to have had a change of heart.
 ''He's open to that,'' Brian McClung, a spokesman for the governor, said Monday of a higher gas tax. ''He believes we need to do everything we can to address this situation and the extraordinary costs.'' 
 Even as the cause of the bridge disaster here remains under investigation, the collapse is changing a lot of minds about spending priorities. It has focused national attention on the crumbling condition of America's roadways and bridges -- and on the financial and political neglect they have received in Washington and many state capitals. 
 Despite historic highs in transportation spending, the political muscle of lawmakers, rather than dire need, has typically driven where much of the money goes. That has often meant construction of new, politically popular roads and transit projects rather than the mundane work of maintaining the worn-out ones.
 Further, transportation and engineering experts said, lawmakers have financed a boom in rail construction that, while politically popular, has resulted in expensive transit systems that are not used by a vast majority of American commuters.
 Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, sent out a news release last month boasting about Minnesota's share of a recent transportation and housing appropriations bill.
 Of the $12 million secured for the state, $10 million is slated for a new 40-mile commuter rail line to Minneapolis, called the Northstar. The remaining $2 million is divided among a new bike and walking path and a few other projects, including highway work and interchange reconstruction.
 The $286 billion federal transportation legislation passed by Congress in 2005 included more than 6,000 earmarks, which amounted to blatant gifts to chosen districts, including the so-called Bridge to Nowhere in rural Alaska (that earmark was later removed after a political uproar).
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a telephone interview Monday that earmarks for transportation in federal legislation were ''almost always new construction and not maintenance.'' Earlier, Mr. Schumer said that he would introduce legislation next month to double a proposed federal transportation bill appropriation, with a focus on upkeep to $10 billion.
 ''The bottom line,'' Mr. Schumer said, ''is that routine but important things like maintenance always get shortchanged because it's nice for somebody to cut a ribbon for a new structure.'' 
 Last week, Representative John L. Mica of Florida, the ranking Republican on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, met with advisers to the Bush administration to urge a nationwide plan to address transportation needs. Rebuilding the I-35W bridge would be only ''a Band-Aid'' Mr. Mica said, ''to a much more serious problem.''
 ''We don't have any kind of strategic plan to deal with infrastructure, and we're falling behind,'' he said.
 In statehouses across the country, legislators tried this past session to fill some of the void by passing bond acts or allocating money to improve roads, bridges and other pieces of the transportation system.
 In Arkansas, lawmakers set aside $80 million, 15 percent of which will be used to repair county roads, 15 percent for city byways and the rest for its highways. New Mexico approved a $200 million plan for local and tribal road projects, and in Texas, $700 million was allotted for state transportation projects over the next two years.
 Voters in California this year authorized nearly $20 billion in transportation bonds to pay for repairs and make other improvements to its taxed system.
 ''We still barely scratched the surface,'' said Adam Mendelsohn, the communications director for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. ''The governor is very concerned about the lack of attention that the federal government has given to infrastructure. It is probably no more acute than in California because of the tremendous strains from population growth.''
 The federal budget for transportation comes largely from excise taxes, particularly on gasoline, set by Congress at 18.4 cents in 1993 and eroded over time by inflation and fuel efficiency. As such, over the last decade, state legislatures in 14 states have voted to raise the state gas tax 19 times. And several states are looking at toll roads and congestion pricing initiatives to help shore up the roads.
 The National Conference of State Legislatures, a group with members from all 50 states, is calling for a 3-cents per gallon increase in the federal gas tax.
 C. Michael Walton, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Texas, Austin, helped write a series of reports issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers that have repeatedly found the nation's highway system with insufficient money. ''Continually falling short of the actual needs,'' Professor Walton said, results largely from ''our backlash to increases in taxes.''
 Professor Walton said states had been looking to the federal government for leadership. ''I am not sure transportation falls to the top of the priorities as it should barring a catastrophic failure,'' he said in reference to state government spending. 
 A study released in May by the Urban Land Institute and Ernst & Young found that 83 percent of the nation's transportation infrastructure was not capable of meeting the country's needs over the next 10 years. The American Society of Civil Engineers, in its latest national report card, gave transportation infrastructure a D. 
 Meanwhile, there are urgent needs. The Interstate highway system turned 50 last year and is showing signs of age and inadequate upkeep. Around St. Louis, for instance, old bridges, rocky roads and tight ramp loops have led to a shutdown of parts of Interstate 64/Highway 40 -- one of the most important corridors in the state -- until late 2009.
 ''It's so easy to let this stuff slip,'' said Robert Dunphy, a senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute. 
 The national highway system, originally called the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, came into being under the Eisenhower administration. (The country's population was 169 million then, and there were about 54 million registered vehicles on the roads.) It was spurred by fears that Americans would have a mobility crisis if the country were attacked in a nuclear war. By the 1970s much of the system was completed. 
 But since then, the nation's highways have eroded with age and use, especially in areas like the Southwest where population booms have far outweighed the ability of roads to carry the new drivers.
 Typically financing for capital transportation projects comes from the federal government matched with funds from states, which are then charged with maintaining the roads and bridges. But the federal government and states operate trust funds, filled with revenues from various excise taxes, which have been unable to maintain existing roadways adequately or finance capital expenditures. 
 But it may often be less the amount allocated for transportation than how it is doled out that leads to eroding highways, some critics say.
 ''Highway funding is supposed to be on the basis of need,'' said Raymond Helmer, a transportation consultant in Houston who has worked on transportation projects for over 50 years. ''There is supposed to be cost-benefit analysis, and every state does a study as required by federal government and comes up with needs, but then politicians say, 'I don't want that road here, I want it here.' ''
 Some transportation experts also said that though light rail and other public transportation projects made sense in cities, investing in them in sprawling suburban regions might not, even if the systems were supported, in theory, by the public. 
 ''Too many American cities are spending far too much money on expensive rail transit projects, which are used for only 1 to 2 percent of local travel, and far too little on highway projects which are used for 95 to 99 percent of local travel,'' Randal O'Toole, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute, said in an e-mail interview.
 There has also been more emphasis nationwide on building new roads than on the maintenance and upkeep of old ones. Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that monitors federal spending, said that might help move traffic in some places, but it left many others with the equivalent of a leaky roof.
 ''It would be irresponsible of me to go out to dinner if I couldn't fix a leak in my roof,'' Mr. Ellis said. ''But that's essentially what we do. We don't take care of what we've got, but we talk a lot about building more and new.''

HEADLINE: 121-Year-Old Pier Seen as Portal to 'Harbor District'

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
For the past 20 years, Pier A has been an overlooked remnant on the waterfront of Lower Manhattan.
 A once-grand Victorian structure that juts toward the Statue of Liberty from the northern edge of Battery Park, the pier has been the object of some big redevelopment plans but little activity. Frustrated by the pace of progress, city officials said last week that they had taken back control of the pier from a private developer and had plans to transform it into the gateway to New York Harbor.
 In just a few years, the pier's three-level structure could be bustling with tourists hopping ferries to the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Governors Island, Brooklyn Bridge Park or the beach at Jacob Riis Park in Queens, said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. 
 In Mr. Doctoroff's view, Pier A could be the linchpin in the city's plan to pull together all of its waterfront recreational areas into a ''harbor district.''
 In late 1987, the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch announced a plan to revitalize the 121-year-old pier, which once housed the harbor police and later was a marine fire station. A decade later, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced the signing of a 49-year lease with a private development group that he said would bring back ''the splendor and economic vitality of our famous waterfront.''
 The developers, known as Wings Point Associates, began rehabilitating the pier, but the project became bogged down in a legal dispute with the city. A few weeks ago, the city's Economic Development Corporation regained control of the pier, paying about $8 million to buy back the lease and settle the litigation with the developers, who were represented by William Wachtel, a Manhattan lawyer who owns part of the New York Waterway commuter ferry service.
 With that settlement, Mr. Doctoroff said, the city is prepared to move forward aggressively.
 Mr. Wachtel had hoped to win the bid with the National Park Service to ferry visitors to the statue and Ellis Island and to remake Pier A into the base of those operations. In fact, in April, he struck a tentative deal with the park service to move the passenger-screening checkpoint for the Liberty and Ellis Island ferries to Pier A from the promenade of Battery Park. The current security operation on the promenade has been less than ideal, blocking views of the statue and the harbor.
 But in late June, the park service rejected Mr. Wachtel's bid and chose a different ferry operator, Hornblower Yachts, to run the ferries. Mr. Wachtel, who plans to continue operating the commuter service, said he was disappointed that he could not hold on to Pier A, especially after having finally worked out a tentative deal with the park service.
 But Mr. Doctoroff said Mr. Wachtel's agreement was too narrow to satisfy the city. Under that deal, he said, the ''city would have effectively lost control'' and would have no leverage to persuade the park service to expand access to other attractions around the harbor.
 Now, city officials must negotiate a new contract for the park service's use of Pier A. Darren Boch, a spokesman for the park service, said Pier A was still the park service's preferred location for passenger screening and boarding. 
 ''We've had a hiccup of sorts regarding Pier A, but it's still something that we're working closely with the city on,'' Mr. Boch said.
 City officials must also decide who will manage the pier. Mr. Doctoroff said he had held preliminary discussions with the Battery Park City Authority, a corporation controlled by the city and the state. 
 ''We concluded that our vision for creating a unified harbor district would be best served with the city in control of Pier A,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''We now have all of the pieces being put in place to create what we believe will be the greatest harbor destination anywhere in the world.''

HEADLINE: Baseball Wants to Look At Umpires Finances

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
Major League Baseball and its umpires union are locked in disagreement about baseball's right to conduct background checks on umpires, representatives from baseball and the World Umpires Association said yesterday.
 In a meeting at league headquarters Thursday in New York, Rob Manfred, baseball's executive vice president for labor relations, requested consent to perform in-depth credit checks on its approximately 70 umpires, an action that legally requires employees' consent.
 Baseball's effort to perform the background checks comes after the federal investigation of Tim Donaghy, a former referee for the N.B.A. who has been accused of betting on league games and associating with gamblers. Donaghy is expected to surrender to authorities in Brooklyn sometime this month. 
 The 30-minute meeting between baseball and representatives for the umpires became contentious, Manfred said, soon after Lamell McMorris, a spokesman for the World Umpires Association, proposed that in return for the authorization to perform credit checks, a seventh umpire be added to regular postseason crews. Manfred strongly objected and soon ended the meeting.
 ''The discussions broke down over one, and only one, issue -- and that was the W.U.A.'s demand that we make an economic concession in return for the members being forthcoming on what we view to be an integrity issue,'' Manfred said. He later added, ''We strongly indicated that we were offended by the effort to trade economics against integrity.''
 McMorris said that Manfred was ''extremely unprofessional'' at the meeting and that the proposal to add a seventh umpire, who would serve only as an alternate in case of injury, was reasonable.
 ''Two things about this are stupid,'' McMorris said. ''One, why didn't they do these background checks before? Why are they so important now, just because another sport is dealing with something? And two, the N.B.A. has an alternate referee at every postseason game.''
 Manfred said that background checks were conducted on all umpires when they were hired, but he declined to specify what those checks included. He added that baseball's security department routinely spoke with law-enforcement officials to monitor any notably suspicious behavior or associations of all its employees.
 ''This consent issue really relates to credit checks; the core is private credit information,'' Manfred said. He would not say whether baseball wanted to perform such a check on every official annually, something the N.B.A. does to monitor any financial difficulties that may cause a referee to be tempted to seek an illegal quick fix.
 ''We do not have an ongoing system for monitoring umpires'' in that manner, Manfred said. He said that baseball's interest in pursuing credit checks arose not from the behavior of any umpire, but ''arose in the wake of the N.B.A. issue.''
 In 1989, Commissioner Fay Vincent placed the umpires Rich Garcia and Frank Pulli on probation for two years for betting on basketball and football games with a bookmaker. An internal investigation found no proof that they had bet on baseball games.
 McMorris, who was recently hired by the umpires association, is the official spokesman for the National Basketball Referees Association, the referees' union, and has been its lead labor negotiator for the past four years. He said that his basketball experience made him skeptical of whether annual in-depth background checks were effective.
 ''Tim Donaghy was a 13-year veteran that had 13 background checks done, and he is still alleged to be engaging in misconduct,'' McMorris said. ''If individuals are determined to do wrongdoing and to participate in misconduct, they're going to find ways to do that.''
 McMorris said that umpires were not considering anything as drastic as a strike. He said that they were ''suspending any cooperation with Major League Baseball'' over the background investigations.
 In addition, McMorris said, ''No home-plate umpire is going to use a broadcast-TV microphone.''
 Fox and ESPN regularly place microphones on umpires for their respective Saturday afternoon and Sunday night national broadcasts. 
 ''Dealing with this issue that relates to the integrity of play on the field is in both of our interests,'' Manfred said of baseball and the umpires union. ''Nobody ought to have to pay or extract an economic benefit for the privilege.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Worker Is Accused Of Falsifying Visa Letters

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
A Russian citizen working in New York for the United Nations was arrested yesterday on charges of using the organization's letterhead to create fake documents that allowed several Uzbek citizens to illegally obtain visas to enter the United States.
 The worker, Vyacheslav Manokhin, was accused in a federal complaint of conspiracy to commit fraud by using his position to make it seem as though the organization supported the visa applications of about a dozen visitors who were ostensibly entering the United States to attend nongovernmental or United Nations conferences. 
 Federal prosecutors said that either the visitors did not attend the meetings or the conferences did not exist. Mr. Manokhin was also accused of trying to help six Ukrainian citizens illegally get visas to enter France.
 Mr. Manokhin, 45, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., pleaded not guilty yesterday at a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan. He was held in $310,000 bail. He could face up to five years in prison. His lawyer, Robert Sikorski, declined to comment. 
 Two other men -- Vladimir Derevianko, 44, a Russian who was granted political asylum in the United States in 2004, and Kamiljan Tursunov, 44, a native of Uzbekistan who lives in Florida -- were also charged. They pleaded not guilty to charges of immigration fraud. Mr. Derevianko was released on $57,500 bail; Mr. Tursunov remained in custody.
 To enter the United States for United Nations conferences, foreigners must apply for a visa, usually by obtaining what immigration officials call a ''letter of request.'' The letters are typically written by officials for the United Nations or whatever other agency may be sponsoring the conference. 
 According to the complaint, Mr. Manokhin and Mr. Derevianko sent fake letters of request beginning in 2005 to both a United Nations office in Uzbekistan and the United States Embassy in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital. The letters were often signed ''Leonardo Brackett'' or ''Greg Smith,'' who were identified as United Nations officials but who did not exist, the complaint said.
 In June 2005, for instance, Leonardo Brackett's name appeared on a letter sent on Mr. Tursunov's behalf to the office of the United Nations Development Program in Uzbekistan, prosecutors said. The letter sought a visa that would allow Mr. Tursunov to attend an annual United Nations conference in New York, though Mr. Tursunov later told federal officers that he had never attended the conference, according to the complaint.
 In an interview with officers this year, Mr. Tursunov -- still in the United States -- said that while he was living in Uzbekistan, he was approached by an associate who told him he could get a United States visa for $15,000, the complaint said. He gave the man his passport and $8,000, the complaint added, and three months later he received a letter signed by Leonardo Brackett. He then used the letter to obtain a visa application from the United Nations, paid the man an additional $7,000 and, soon thereafter, received his passport with a visa, prosecutors said. 
 In January, the complaint said, Mr. Manokhin sent a letter to the United States Embassy in Tashkent requesting a visa for an Uzbek citizen, who was not named in the complaint, to attend a law conference in New York. The conference -- which did not exist, prosecutors said -- was described as ''a round table'' concerning ''alternatives to pretrial incarceration,'' complete with ''representatives of charitable organizations'' and ''specialists who work in the field.'' Sessions would take place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, the letter said, ''except Saturday and Sunday.''
 As part of its investigation of Mr. Manokhin, federal officers visited the Lower Manhattan law firm where the conference was supposed to have taken place and interviewed the receptionist. She said that no conference had been scheduled, according to the complaint. The officers also interviewed a lawyer at the firm who was one of the founding directors of the agency that had supposedly arranged the round table. He, too, had never heard of such a thing, the complaint said.

PERSON: Raul Hilberg 

HEADLINE: Raul Hilberg, 81, Historian Who Wrote of the Holocaust as a Bureaucracy, Dies

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Raul Hilberg, a Jewish emigre from Nazi-occupied Vienna who helped begin the field of Holocaust studies with his long and minutely detailed 1961 study of the massacre of European Jews, died Saturday in Williston, Vt. He was 81.
 The cause was lung cancer, said Jeffrey R. Wakefield, a spokesman for the University of Vermont, where Mr. Hilberg had taught for 35 years. 
 In his landmark work, ''The Destruction of the European Jews,'' Mr. Hilberg said the Holocaust had been the result of a huge bureaucratic machine with thousands of participants, not the fulfillment of a preconceived plan or a single order by Hitler. 
 As uncountable separate instructions were passed on, formally and informally, to a range of actors that included train schedulers and gas chamber architects, responsibility became ever more diluted, he argued, even as the machinery of death churned inexorably ahead.
 ''For these reasons, an administrator, clerk or uniformed guard never referred to himself as a perpetrator,'' Mr. Hilberg said in an interview with The Chicago Tribune in 1992. ''He realized, however, that the process of destruction was deliberate, and that once he had stepped into this maelstrom, his deed would be indelible.''
 Though some critics said Mr. Hilberg had understated the impact of historic German anti-Semitism, his broad conclusions were based on painstaking research. He examined microfilm of thousands upon thousands of prosaic documents like train schedules and memorandums between minor officials.
 ''This head-against-the-wall technique is the only virtue I can parade without blushing,'' he said last year when Germany gave him with its Order of Merit, the highest tribute it can pay to someone who is not a German citizen.
 The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote that Mr. Hilberg's book ''reveals, methodically, fully and clearly, the development of both the technical and psychological process; the machinery and mentality whereby one whole society sought to isolate and destroy another, which, for centuries, had lived in its midst.''
 Mr. Trevor-Roper called the book's most surprising revelation, and its least welcome one, its suggestion that at least some Jews cooperated in their own annihilation. Examples included Jews who had helped organize deportations or led victims to gas chambers. Mr. Hilberg argued that Jews had a long history of passivity and that some had mistakenly calculated that the Nazis would not destroy what they could economically exploit.
 Many historians, survivors and Jewish leaders disagreed, pointing to examples of Jewish resistance. But Holocaust historians of all views began using terminology Mr. Hilberg had devised, including that of calling the Holocaust's principals perpetrators, victims and bystanders.
 Raul Hilberg was born on June 2, 1926, in Vienna. In his memoir, ''The Politics of Memory: Journey of a Holocaust Historian'' (1996), he said his father, Michael, had been a ''middleman,'' someone who bought household goods for people needing credit and paid him in installments. In 1938, the occupying Nazis arrested him but released him because he was a World War I veteran.
 The Hilbergs emigrated to Brooklyn, where Michael worked in a factory and Raul attended Lincoln High School. His studies at Brooklyn College were interrupted when he was drafted into the Army. His unit was housed in the Nazi Party's former offices in Munich, where Mr. Hilberg was fascinated by crates containing Hitler's personal library.
 He returned to Brooklyn College, where he quit chemistry for political science and history. He went on to Columbia, where he insisted on writing his doctoral dissertation on the Holocaust, which few academics were studying. His adviser, Franz Neumann, warned him that his choice of subject might be his academic funeral. 
 At least five publishers rejected his major book. It was published by a small Chicago house after a wealthy patron agreed to buy 1,300 copies to go to libraries.
 His caustic personal style, which contrasted with the monotone of his histories, did not always help. When academics asked about his subject area, Mr. Hilberg was prone to reply, ''I study dead Jews.''
 He next taught at Hunter College and landed a federal job helping to catalog documents being released from German archives. He copied material by hand so he could use it for his own research. 
 Mr. Hilberg started teaching at Vermont in 1956 and retired in 1991. In addition to writing and editing five books besides ''The Destruction of the European Jews'' and his memoirs, Mr. Hilberg produced two more editions of that book (1985 and 2003), adding considerable material. 
 Mr. Hilberg's first marriage, to Christine Hemenway, ended in divorce. He is survived by two children from that marriage, David, of Brooklyn, and Deborah, of Jerusalem, and his wife, the former Gwendolyn Montgomery.
 The multitudinous materials Mr. Hilberg examined convinced him that those very documents were the strongest argument against those who contended the Holocaust had never happened, he told The International Herald Tribune in 1996.
 ''These individuals are not familiar with the archives, or they would see that nobody could forge these millions of documents,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Dusty Archives, a Theory of Affluence

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
For thousands of years, most people on earth lived in abject poverty, first as hunters and gatherers, then as peasants or laborers. But with the Industrial Revolution, some societies traded this ancient poverty for amazing affluence. 
 Historians and economists have long struggled to understand how this transition occurred and why it took place only in some countries. A scholar who has spent the last 20 years scanning medieval English archives has now emerged with startling answers for both questions.
 Gregory Clark, an economic historian at the University of California, Davis, believes that the Industrial Revolution -- the surge in economic growth that occurred first in England around 1800 -- occurred because of a change in the nature of the human population. The change was one in which people gradually developed the strange new behaviors required to make a modern economy work. The middle-class values of nonviolence, literacy, long working hours and a willingness to save emerged only recently in human history, Dr. Clark argues. 
 Because they grew more common in the centuries before 1800, whether by cultural transmission or evolutionary adaptation, the English population at last became productive enough to escape from poverty, followed quickly by other countries with the same long agrarian past. 
 Dr. Clark's ideas have been circulating in articles and manuscripts for several years and are to be published as a book next month, ''A Farewell to Alms'' (Princeton University Press). Economic historians have high praise for his thesis, though many disagree with parts of it. 
 ''This is a great book and deserves attention,'' said Philip Hoffman, a historian at the California Institute of Technology. He described it as ''delightfully provocative'' and a ''real challenge'' to the prevailing school of thought that it is institutions that shape economic history.
 Samuel Bowles, an economist who studies cultural evolution at the Santa Fe Institute, said Dr. Clark's work was ''great historical sociology and, unlike the sociology of the past, is informed by modern economic theory.'' 
 The basis of Dr. Clark's work is his recovery of data from which he can reconstruct many features of the English economy from 1200 to 1800. From this data, he shows, far more clearly than has been possible before, that the economy was locked in a Malthusian trap -- -- each time new technology increased the efficiency of production a little, the population grew, the extra mouths ate up the surplus, and average income fell back to its former level.
 This income was pitifully low in terms of the amount of wheat it could buy. By 1790, the average person's consumption in England was still just 2,322 calories a day, with the poor eating a mere 1,508. Living hunter-gatherer societies enjoy diets of 2,300 calories or more.
 ''Primitive man ate well compared with one of the richest societies in the world in 1800,'' Dr. Clark observes. 
 The tendency of population to grow faster than the food supply, keeping most people at the edge of starvation, was described by Thomas Malthus in a 1798 book, ''An Essay on the Principle of Population.'' This Malthusian trap, Dr. Clark's data show, governed the English economy from 1200 until the Industrial Revolution and has in his view probably constrained humankind throughout its existence. The only respite was during disasters like the Black Death, when population plummeted, and for several generations the survivors had more to eat.
 Malthus's book is well known because it gave Darwin the idea of natural selection. Reading of the struggle for existence that Malthus predicted, Darwin wrote in his autobiography, ''It at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. ... Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work.''
 Given that the English economy operated under Malthusian constraints, might it not have responded in some way to the forces of natural selection that Darwin had divined would flourish in such conditions? Dr. Clark started to wonder whether natural selection had indeed changed the nature of the population in some way and, if so, whether this might be the missing explanation for the Industrial Revolution. 
 The Industrial Revolution, the first escape from the Malthusian trap, occurred when the efficiency of production at last accelerated, growing fast enough to outpace population growth and allow average incomes to rise. Many explanations have been offered for this spurt in efficiency, some economic and some political, but none is fully satisfactory, historians say. 
 Dr. Clark's first thought was that the population might have evolved greater resistance to disease. The idea came from Jared Diamond's book ''Guns, Germs and Steel,'' which argues that Europeans were able to conquer other nations in part because of their greater immunity to disease. 
 In support of the disease-resistance idea, cities like London were so filthy and disease ridden that a third of their populations died off every generation, and the losses were restored by immigrants from the countryside. That suggested to Dr. Clark that the surviving population of England might be the descendants of peasants. 
 A way to test the idea, he realized, was through analysis of ancient wills, which might reveal a connection between wealth and the number of progeny. The wills did that, , but in quite the opposite direction to what he had expected.
 Generation after generation, the rich had more surviving children than the poor, his research showed. That meant there must have been constant downward social mobility as the poor failed to reproduce themselves and the progeny of the rich took over their occupations. ''The modern population of the English is largely descended from the economic upper classes of the Middle Ages,'' he concluded.
 As the progeny of the rich pervaded all levels of society, Dr. Clark considered, the behaviors that made for wealth could have spread with them. He has documented that several aspects of what might now be called middle-class values changed significantly from the days of hunter gatherer societies to 1800. Work hours increased, literacy and numeracy rose, and the level of interpersonal violence dropped.
 Another significant change in behavior, Dr. Clark argues, was an increase in people's preference for saving over instant consumption, which he sees reflected in the steady decline in interest rates from 1200 to 1800.
 ''Thrift, prudence, negotiation and hard work were becoming values for communities that previously had been spendthrift, impulsive, violent and leisure loving,'' Dr. Clark writes.
 Around 1790, a steady upward trend in production efficiency first emerges in the English economy. It was this significant acceleration in the rate of productivity growth that at last made possible England's escape from the Malthusian trap and the emergence of the Industrial Revolution.
 In the rest of Europe and East Asia, populations had also long been shaped by the Malthusian trap of their stable agrarian economies. Their workforces easily absorbed the new production technologies that appeared first in England. 
 It is puzzling that the Industrial Revolution did not occur first in the much larger populations of China or Japan. Dr. Clark has found data showing that their richer classes, the Samurai in Japan and the Qing dynasty in China, were surprisingly unfertile and so would have failed to generate the downward social mobility that spread production-oriented values in England.
 After the Industrial Revolution, the gap in living standards between the richest and the poorest countries started to accelerate, from a wealth disparity of about 4 to 1 in 1800 to more than 50 to 1 today. Just as there is no agreed explanation for the Industrial Revolution, economists cannot account well for the divergence between rich and poor nations or they would have better remedies to offer. 
 Many commentators point to a failure of political and social institutions as the reason that poor countries remain poor. But the proposed medicine of institutional reform ''has failed repeatedly to cure the patient,'' Dr. Clark writes. He likens the ''cult centers'' of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to prescientific physicians who prescribed bloodletting for ailments they did not understand.
 If the Industrial Revolution was caused by changes in people's behavior, then populations that have not had time to adapt to the Malthusian constraints of agrarian economies will not be able to achieve the same production efficiencies, his thesis implies. 
 Dr. Clark says the middle-class values needed for productivity could have been transmitted either culturally or genetically. But in some passages, he seems to lean toward evolution as the explanation. ''Through the long agrarian passage leading up to the Industrial Revolution, man was becoming biologically more adapted to the modern economic world,'' he writes. And, ''The triumph of capitalism in the modern world thus may lie as much in our genes as in ideology or rationality.''
 What was being inherited, in his view, was not greater intelligence -- being a hunter in a foraging society requires considerably greater skill than the repetitive actions of an agricultural laborer. Rather, it was ''a repertoire of skills and dispositions that were very different from those of the pre-agrarian world.''
 Reaction to Dr. Clark's thesis from other economic historians seems largely favorable, although few agree with all of it, and many are skeptical of the most novel part, his suggestion that evolutionary change is a factor to be considered in history.
 Historians used to accept changes in people's behavior as an explanation for economic events, like Max Weber's thesis linking the rise of capitalism with Protestantism. But most have now swung to the economists' view that all people are alike and will respond in the same way to the same incentives. Hence they seek to explain events like the Industrial Revolution in terms of changes in institutions, not people.
 Dr. Clark's view is that institutions and incentives have been much the same all along and explain very little, which is why there is so little agreement on the causes of the Industrial Revolution. In saying the answer lies in people's behavior, he is asking his fellow economic historians to revert to a type of explanation they had mostly abandoned and in addition is evoking an idea that historians seldom consider as an explanatory variable, that of evolution.
 Most historians have assumed that evolutionary change is too gradual to have affected human populations in the historical period. But geneticists, with information from the human genome now at their disposal, have begun to detect ever more recent instances of human evolutionary change like the spread of lactose tolerance in cattle-raising people of northern Europe just 5,000 years ago. A study in the current American Journal of Human Genetics finds evidence of natural selection at work in the population of Puerto Rico since 1513. So historians are likely to be more enthusiastic about the medieval economic data and elaborate time series that Dr. Clark has reconstructed than about his suggestion that people adapted to the Malthusian constraints of an agrarian society.
 ''He deserves kudos for assembling all this data,'' said Dr. Hoffman, the Caltech historian, ''but I don't agree with his underlying argument.'' 
 The decline in English interest rates, for example, could have been caused by the state's providing better domestic security and enforcing property rights, Dr. Hoffman said, not by a change in people's willingness to save, as Dr. Clark asserts.
 The natural-selection part of Dr. Clark's argument ''is significantly weaker, and maybe just not necessary, if you can trace the changes in the institutions,'' said Kenneth L. Pomeranz, a historian at the University of California, Irvine. In a recent book, ''The Great Divergence,'' Dr. Pomeranz argues that tapping new sources of energy like coal and bringing new land into cultivation, as in the North American colonies, were the productivity advances that pushed the old agrarian economies out of their Malthusian constraints.
 Robert P. Brenner, a historian at the University of California, Los Angeles, said although there was no satisfactory explanation at present for why economic growth took off in Europe around 1800, he believed that institutional explanations would provide the answer and that Dr. Clark's idea of genes for capitalist behavior was ''quite a speculative leap.''
 Dr. Bowles, the Santa Fe economist, said he was ''not averse to the idea'' that genetic transmission of capitalist values is important, but that the evidence for it was not yet there. ''It's just that we don't have any idea what it is, and everything we look at ends up being awfully small,'' he said. Tests of most social behaviors show they are very weakly heritable.
 He also took issue with Dr. Clark's suggestion that the unwillingness to postpone consumption, called time preference by economists, had changed in people over the centuries. ''If I were as poor as the people who take out payday loans, I might also have a high time preference,'' he said. 
 Dr. Clark said he set out to write his book 12 years ago on discovering that his undergraduates knew nothing about the history of Europe. His colleagues have been surprised by its conclusions but also interested in them, he said. 
 ''The actual data underlying this stuff is hard to dispute,'' Dr. Clark said. ''When people see the logic, they say 'I don't necessarily believe it, but it's hard to dismiss.' ''

HEADLINE: Credit Worries, Imported From U.S., Lead German Firm to Shut Fund

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
which last week became the first European country to be infected by the woes in the American mortgage market, suffered another blow on Monday when an asset management firm in Frankfurt closed a fund to temporarily halt withdrawals by rattled investors.
 The management firm, Frankfurt-Trust, said the withdrawals from the fund, FT ABS-Plus, reflected jitters about the subprime lending market in the United States, even though the fund had only minor exposure to that market. 
 Investors have become nervous in recent weeks as worries about credit problems that started in subprime mortgages in the United States have spread to Europe and Asia. The stock markets have swung wildly of late, reflecting uncertainty about the outlook for the market and the risks to the economy. 
 ''We had to close the fund because we got a lot of demands from people to get their money out,'' Rainer Gogel, the fund's manager, said. ''We did it because we wanted to protect the investors.''
 Mr. Gogel said he did not know when the fund, which is currently worth 160 million euros ($219 million), would reopen. He suggested that the market turbulence might persist for a while. ''We had excesses in the market,'' he said. ''All those excesses are being dealt with at once.''
 Last week, a German bank, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, roiled the markets when it disclosed deteriorating subprime investments. A government-backed group agreed to bail out the bank, providing 3.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) to cover IKB's potential losses on its $24 billion investment in the market.
 Two other asset-backed securities funds with exposure to subprime mortgages in the United States -- run by Union Investment and HSBC Investments Deutschland -- were closed last week.
 Since then, German officials, central bankers and the heads of private banks have appealed for calm. Some have pointed out that the mortgage mayhem in the United States need not destabilize European markets, especially at a time when Europe's economies are showing considerable vigor.
 Investors need to keep their ''sang-froid,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, said on Thursday.
 Yet fund managers and credit analysts said they feared more unpleasant disclosures from German banks and mutual funds, several of which appear to have been enthusiastic gamblers in this risky market.
 ''It's a bit like discovering Easter eggs,'' said Boris Boehm, a money manager at Nordinvest in Hamburg. ''There are a lot of eggs hidden around here. You'll be hearing more and more about these problems.''
 To be sure, several of Germany's largest financial institutions have played down their exposure to the subprime market. Deutsche Bank even profited from the chaos by selling mortgage loans with derivatives contracts that appreciated as the United States housing market slumped.
 Commerzbank said its exposure to the subprime market accounted for a tiny fraction of its balance sheet, as did three of Germany's largest insurers: Allianz, Munich Re and Hannover Re.
 The problems, analysts said, are likely to crop up in smaller, less well-known institutions, like IKB, which until last week operated in comparative obscurity as a lender to midsize, privately owned German companies.
 ''The general impression was that they were quite a conservative bank,'' said Simon Adamson, a banking analyst at CreditSights, a research firm in London. ''The mistake they made was they thought they were safe investing in high-grade paper. They didn't reckon on the huge difference between the view of the ratings agencies and the value in the market.''
 Mr. Adamson said he would not be surprised to see more IKBs: banks that, because they have little experience in these markets, rely heavily on credit-rating agencies. Fund managers are also vulnerable, he said, because the banks packaged and sold subprime investments to them.
 Investor confidence in Europe is being further eroded by the fact that the bad news is coming out in dribs and drabs. 
 ''The big problem is the lack of disclosure,'' Mr. Adamson said. ''Since it's hard to be sure of anything, the market quite understandably fears the worst. It is going hunting for banks with exposure and losses.''
 The uncertainty took a toll on European stock markets. Shares in London and Paris slumped on Monday, although Frankfurt's DAX index eked out a slight increase.
 Paradoxically, some of the best performers were banks that had been shadowed by credit fears. Shares of Natixis, a French bank, rose 6 percent, rebounding from a 10 percent decline on Friday, after it said the subprime market would have only a limited impact on its results.
 IKB's shares jumped 11 percent, following steep losses, after the bank played down a report that its losses from subprime investments could exceed the $4.8 billion rescue fund.

HEADLINE: In King's Footsteps, Others Try To Dream

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
If you stand in the middle of Auburn Avenue, outside the Queen Anne-style home in which the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born in 1929, and look past the King Center, past the trees leading into the National Park Service Visitor Center and past Ebenezer Baptist Church, toward the office buildings and hotels of downtown Atlanta, you can get some sense of what the precocious Martin might have felt standing in the same spot, before his family moved off the street when he was 12.
 Of course in the 1930s the downtown didn't look quite so elaborate, and across from Martin's home the narrow houses, recently restored by the Park Service, would not have appeared as pristine. Nor of course would Martin have seen all the energy, controversy and conflict as the King Center (run by members of his family) spiraled into uncertainty, as the Park Service expanded its ambitions and as a small, independent African-American museum took a different stand on the context of Dr. King's achievement.
 But Martin saw Auburn Avenue about the time that it was given the nickname Sweet Auburn. It was then said to be the wealthiest street in black America, and perhaps the most economically diverse as well. 
 If Martin had walked down Sweet Auburn then, he would have seen the building in which he was to lead the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in the civil-rights battles of the 1960s. And he would have seen the headquarters of The Atlanta Daily World, which in 1932 (a current plaque informs us) became ''the first daily black newspaper in the world.'' 
 In those days too, when Atlanta's citizens could still recall the 1906 riots in which white people attacked the city's black residents, Auburn Avenue was home to a rising black middle class, at least until that dream too bumped into a barrier that Martin would be so instrumental in breaking down. For a young boy conscious of race issues through his father's teaching, this avenue, leading toward the white downtown, must have been a reminder of both high aspiration and incomprehensible restriction. 
 There is something so intimate about the connection of Auburn Avenue with Dr. King and his movement that I feel grateful that its vantage point survives. It does largely because Coretta Scott King succeeded in preventing the demolition of her husband's birth home and helped get the neighborhood named a historic district. Then, after founding the King Center, she lobbied for the creation of what in 1980 became the King National Historic Site and Preservation District, an amalgam of national park, shrine, museum, business-improvement district and historical village still being remodeled to reflect different periods of Dr. King's life.
 This historic site, which includes the birth home, a visitors' center, the Ebenezer Baptist Church and surrounding areas, restores the 1930s of Dr. King's boyhood on one block. On another block the church is getting a $4 million restoration to its appearance during the 1960s, when Dr. King could be heard at the pulpit. The site attracts more than 700,000 visitors a year. 
 The family-run King Center, meanwhile, has been in trouble. For a decade or so after moving to its current complex in 1981 it sponsored lectures and special events, advocated nonviolent causes and helped establish the surrounding site. More recently it has been characterized by slackened activity, confusion about its mission and accusations of family malfeasance and short-sightedness. 
 This mini-saga, as first reported in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, has included battles between Dr. King's two sons, Dexter Scott and Martin Luther III, over the center's future; the use of its nonprofit funds to pay a for-profit company, run by Dexter King, then the center's president; the payment of large six-figure salaries to these two sons even as the building deteriorated -- all this, and much more. 
 Meanwhile, as if confirming that the dominant interest of the center was no longer as Mrs. King envisioned -- the preservation of Dr. King's legacy and papers -- but the income it can generate, the family put a 7,000-page cache of documents up for auction at Sotheby's. The collection was rescued from the prospect of dispersal or private ownership in 2006, when Mayor Shirley Franklin of Atlanta put together a $32 million package to purchase the papers for Morehouse College, Dr. King's alma mater. 
 But continuing family debates led to more controversies earlier this year over whether to sell the center to the Park Service. The family ultimately did not sell, though the Park Service estimated that the building needed more than $11 million in repairs.
 In an interview Isaac Newton Farris Jr., the center's current president, said that changes were under way. The Web site (thekingcenter.org) hasn't been updated since 2004, and public programming has all but stopped. The center is involved with the publication of Dr. King's papers and plans what Mr. Farris calls a scholar in residence program, but as a research institution it has problems. 
 In the archives and library many cartons are clearly water-damaged or in piles, as if awaiting unpacking after a move; objects mailed to the center lie haphazardly on chairs and along walls; tarps cover tables. The center's three room-size exhibitions in its Freedom Hall are overseen by the Park Service; the main room consists largely of uninspiring personal memorabilia and biographical timelines. 
 Unless the center undergoes a much-needed redefinition, it seems to have outlived its mission. But the Park Service, judging from its visitor center, has the drive to create the kind of memorial the King Center cannot, and it could also make use of the center's dormant auditorium. Even now the visitor center offers an impressively thorough exhibition mounted in 1996 (marred mainly by design choices that made a lot of the text difficult to read), recounting Dr. King's life and the movement he helped lead. A survey of Atlanta's 1906 riots in a smaller gallery will close in late August, to be replaced by a traveling exhibition about the Soviet Gulag. 
 With such plans the Park Service sees itself expanding on the King legacy, universalizing it to explore human-rights issues. This offers opportunities of course, but it also risks creating questionable parallels. The Park Service has, for example, helped establish the 1.5-mile Carter-King Peace Walk, a path linking the King site with the Carter Center and Library established by President Jimmy Carter, creating a tenuous connection between ''two of the world's greatest peacemakers,'' in the words of the Park Service. 
 Similar challenges will face the city as it plans for a $100 million civil- and human-rights museum (which may open not in the Sweet Auburn area but downtown, near Coca-Cola's new museum, on land donated by Coke). 
 On the other end of Auburn Avenue a smaller museum created in 1978 by the filmmaker Dan Moore pushes in another direction, treating the civil-liberties movement not as part of the human-rights tradition but as part of African history.
 The APEX Museum (an acronym for the African-American Panoramic Experience) attracts more than 60,000 visitors a year and says that ''every month is black history month.'' Dr. King is barely a presence. 
 The APEX approach is less concerned with accommodation and resolution and more with pain and pride. A replica of one of Atlanta's first black-owned businesses, the Yates & Milton Drug Store, is in its main space, jarringly shared with a cutaway display of the inside of a slave ship. A temporary exhibition of artwork, from kitsch to strongly imagined images, from the National Alliance of Artists From Historically Black Colleges and Universities fills the rest of the gallery space. In a theater meant to resemble a trolley's interior, one film pays tribute to Sweet Auburn; another recounts the history of Africa. 
 In an interview Mr. Moore said he hopes to raise $30 million to build an African-American history museum on the site, although no money has yet been collected. His dream may also face competition from the city's planned civil-rights museum. 
 But the APEX, on one end of Sweet Auburn, and the King Historic Site on the other provide examples of a recurring tension in black American politics, one pole leading toward universalist liberalism, the other toward nationalist pride. Many other approaches, yet to be explored, lie between. When young Martin looked down Sweet Auburn with what must have been a mixture of aspiration and exasperation, could he have imagined how many twists and turns were to come?

HEADLINE: A New Owner's Unspoken Aggressiveness

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The last time the Mets played the Atlanta Braves, the new ownership of the Braves was in place for only a week, certainly not time enough to make a difference. As the Mets prepare to play the Braves at Shea Stadium tonight, nearly three months later, the difference is palpable.
 Playing first base and batting cleanup, Mark Teixeira. 
 It is highly unlikely that the Braves would have acquired Teixeira last week at the trade deadline if Time Warner still owned them. His $9 million salary this season and the even higher salary he will command in salary arbitration next year would have been too rich for the Time Warner Braves.
 Talk among some baseball executives the past week was that the Braves' new owner, John Malone of Liberty Media, has told his new employees to spend money to improve the chances of making the playoffs. Liberty Media, it was said, wants to be a big player -- like the Red Sox. 
 If that is so, though, Malone hasn't told Braves executives, they said.
 ''I'm glad someone has spoken to him; we haven't,'' General Manager John Schuerholz said. ''We're marching along as we always have with no alteration, no change either to the perceived negative or the perceived positive.''
 The only person Schuerholz said he had spoken to was Terry McGuirk, the holdover president. Has McGuirk told him to spend more?
 ''We haven't had that discussion,'' Schuerholz said. ''We haven't needed to have that kind of discussion. It would be more accurate to say we're proceeding as always.
 ''We had economic flexibility built into our operating budget this year sufficient enough to fit the pieces in.'' 
 With the irrepressible Ted Turner as their owner, the Braves competed for players on the highest economic levels. 
 Time Warner, however, was a corporate owner, and corporate owners operate differently. Look at the CBS Yankees of the 1960s and pre-Steinbrenner '70s, for example.
 After the 2002 season, the Braves had to choose between Tom Glavine or Greg Maddux. They let Glavine go, and a year later they let Maddux leave, too. In recent seasons, they traded or let solid players go as free agents rather than sign them to long-term contracts or deal with them in salary arbitration: Marcus Giles, Rafael Furcal, Javy Lopez, J. D. Drew, Gary Sheffield, Kevin Millwood.
 Schuerholz became adept at acquiring new pieces annually, and Manager Bobby Cox became a master of fitting those pieces into the ever-changing puzzle. The changes did not affect the Braves' success on the field until last year, when their unparalleled run of successive division championships ended at 14.
 This season, the Braves are contending again for the division title or the wild card, and having a new owner apparently won't hurt their ability to compete. But the Braves don't want to give the idea that Malone has issued instructions on economics.
 ''I can honestly say the new owner has said nothing,'' said McGuirk, whose continued status as club president was necessary for Major League Baseball to approve Liberty Media. ''There hasn't been any conversation on the subject. The decisions we made are ones we made in our role of running the franchise and making the best business judgments.''
 Would the Braves have made the same judgments under Time Warner?
 ''I don't know exactly how we would have approached it under Time Warner,'' McGuirk said. ''They are quite disciplined with their budgets. I think the reason they sold the baseball team was this is not a business that is part of what they do. They're an entertainment company, and it's hard for them to figure out how to spend money in sports.''
 Besides Teixeira, the Braves acquired relievers Octavio Dotel and Ron Mahay, giving up the rookie with the longest last name in major league history, Jarrod Saltalamacchia; a starting pitcher, Kyle Davies; and four minor leaguers.
 ''We felt it was very reasonable for us to be very aggressive in these trades,'' Schuerholz said. ''I don't recall a player of Teixeira's ability traded at the trading deadline. It's not an ordinary process for someone of that caliber to be available then. So we made an extraordinary effort to make it happen.'' 
 Most often a player with Teixeira's ability is traded at the deadline because he can be a free agent at the end of the season. Teixeira, however, can't be a free agent until after the 2008 season. If he helps the Braves get to October, they will probably try to sign him long term, although they also face the prospect of Andruw Jones, their longtime center fielder, becoming a free agent after this season. 
 ''The feeling now among fans and players is probably more enthusiastic than it has been in five years,'' McGuirk said. ''At the end of the day, we know that winning creates value. We're all about winning. I'm sure that fits with the Liberty philosophy of life.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Campaign on Mortgage and Trade Issues

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Two Democratic presidential candidates, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Senator John Edwards, are moving to tap into the economic anxieties of working Americans by introducing proposals to deal with the home-loan crisis and the flood of imports from overseas.
 In a speech scheduled for this morning in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton is to propose providing $2 billion in federal money to help ''at risk'' homeowners avoid foreclosures and to assist state and local governments build rental properties and other housing for families in need. 
 Mr. Edwards yesterday seized on the recent imports of tainted pet food and unsafe toys from China to argue that the United States needs new trade policies to protect both its workers and its consumers.
 According to a preview of her remarks provided by her campaign, Mrs. Clinton, of New York, will lay out a plan to deal with mortgage lending abuses and to ''preserve the dream of homeownership'' at a time of crisis in the mortgage markets as homeowners default or face foreclosure when their adjustable rates climb upwards.
 Mrs. Clinton's plan, according to the outline her campaign provided, zeroes in on ''unscrupulous brokers.'' She would require mortgage brokers, in their dealing with borrowers, to explain that they make more money when borrowers' mortgage rates and fees are high. She would also establish a national registration system for brokers so that borrowers can do background checks, and pledged to work with states to develop licensing standards to ensure that brokers are properly qualified. 
 Banking analysts generally note, though, that brokers are only part of a larger problem: They are lieutenants for the lenders in a mortgage industry that has until now been eager to extend easy credit to homeowners who may not be aware of the ultimate costs of their mortgages once their adjustable rates rise.
 Mrs. Clinton would also prohibit the use of prepayment penalties, which can trap borrowers into high-cost loans and discourage them from refinancing into less costly mortgages. And she would require lenders to include the cost of taxes and insurance in the underwriting assessment of higher-risk mortgages.
 Campaigning yesterday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Mr. Edwards, of North Carolina, told a packed union hall that recent events had shown that global trade carried consequences not only for the nation's jobs but also for its health and safety. 
 ''We need to make sure that trade is not only smart and good for America's economy and good for American workers, but safe for American families,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''Regular families -- their safety and their best interests -- should come before the interests of multinational corporations.''
 Mr. Edwards has long argued that recent trade agreements have sent good-paying jobs overseas and contributed to stagnant wages in the United States. But by drawing attention to recent safety hazards in imports -- including tainted pet food and toys with lead paint -- he sought to broaden the debate about the effects of trade to make it a consumer issue as well as one for labor.
 Mr. Edwards said he would require food from abroad to be labeled with its country of origin, increase inspections on imported food, strengthen safety standards for trading partners and stiffen the penalties for safety violations in imported toys.
 Mr. Edwards was sharply critical of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and after the speech he told reporters that as president he would renegotiate the pact to make sure that higher environmental and labor standards were written directly into it. 
 While he did not name President Bill Clinton, who pushed Nafta through to win Congressional approval, Mr. Edwards noted pointedly that ''for far too long, presidents from both parties have entered into trade agreements, agreements like Nafta, promising that they would create millions of new jobs'' when ''too many of these agreements have cost us jobs and devastated many of our towns.''

HEADLINE: Fed's Focus And Rate Unchanged

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged on Tuesday and signaled that it still expected to avoid cutting short-term rates despite the recent tumult in credit markets and on Wall Street. The Fed suggested that it would change course only if economic conditions deteriorate badly in the weeks and months ahead.
 In a statement announcing that the overnight lending rate it controls would remain unchanged at 5.25 percent, the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not drift significantly from its core message that inflation remains a greater risk to the economy than recession. 
 The central bank, however, softened its tone slightly by giving some recognition to worsening conditions in financial markets, by adding a new phrase to its statement saying that the risk of an economic downturn has ''increased somewhat.''
 ''The Fed threw the markets a bone, commenting on recent market volatility and tighter credit conditions,'' Steven A. Wood of Insight Economics wrote in a commentary. ''However, they gave no hint that they would act anytime soon.''
 On Wall Street, traders had difficulty sorting out the Fed's message and by the end of the day still seemed convinced that the Fed was keeping the door open to a rate cut later this year. After falling sharply minutes after the statement was released around 2:15 p.m., stocks later rebounded, finishing trading modestly higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index gained 0.6 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average added almost 36 points to close at 13,504.30.
 In the futures market, the odds of a rate cut by the end of this year were reduced somewhat but still remained greater than even. Many on Wall Street had hoped that the recent tightening in credit markets would prompt the Fed to more clearly signal a shift in its focus from concern about inflation toward a greater fear of an economic downturn. 
 But the Fed gave Wall Street something much less definitive.
 ''I think this means that the Fed isn't preparing the market for a rate cut anytime soon,'' said Tom Gallagher, a Fed analyst with the ISI Group in Washington, a financial research firm. ''On the other hand, they set up a statement that they could use to justify a rate cut if things deteriorate faster than they now expect.''
 The Fed statement noted that ''financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing.'' 
 ''Nevertheless,'' the statement continued, ''the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.''
 Analysts said that the Fed appeared to be saying that the recent volatility in the markets did not appear to be spreading much beyond Wall Street.
 ''They acknowledged that there is uncertainty in the markets, but that uncertainty remains a financial issue rather than a real economic issue,'' said Jack Caffrey, an equity strategist with JPMorgan Private Bank. ''And ultimately, they're going to take their direction from the real economy.''
 The stock market has been on edge in recent weeks as concern spread that tighter lending standards for everyone from large corporations to prospective home buyers could cause the economy to seize up. But the Fed saw that as unlikely to happen.
 Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told Congress three weeks ago that the central bank's economic forecast for the year had become only slightly more pessimistic since February, despite the growing problems with housing.
 Analysts said one reason for the Fed's stance is that under Mr. Bernanke the central bank is more reluctant to bail out those suffering from financial losses than it was under his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, who was much more willing to ease credit in times of market uncertainty.
 ''Ben Bernanke is more standoffish,'' said Drew Matus, an economist with Lehman Brothers. ''He's the guy sitting there watching the kids in the playground. And if there's a fight, he's going to stay out of it unless somebody's going to get hurt. Greenspan was more like a doting parent.''
 But the recent tightening in the credit markets poses the most significant challenge to policy makers since the Fed stopped raising rates in June 2006. In the last year, the central bank has been able to hold rates steady as economic growth moderated and it appeared that underlying inflation would soon slow to a pace of under 2 percent a year.
 Now, however, policy makers appear to be facing a more jarring -- and complicated -- reality. The economy and the job market remain relatively healthy and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the price index for personal consumption spending excluding food and energy -- has come down to a 1.9 percent rate after running as high as 2.5 percent early this year. But the credit market tightening has significantly raised longer-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
 In addition to the challenge of conducting monetary policy, there is new evidence that the productivity advances of the past decade may be ebbing.
 Productivity grew at a 1.8 percent rate in the second quarter, the Labor Department said on Tuesday, but the gains of previous years were revised downward. For the first quarter, worker productivity grew at a 0.7 percent rate, off from the earlier estimate of 1 percent, and the advance for all of 2006 was set at just 1 percent, the slowest since the surge in productivity began in the mid-1990s. 
 Greater worker productivity makes it easier to maintain strong economic growth without adding to inflation. 
 Analysts on Wall Street found themselves in the awkward position of looking forward to more trouble in the economy before the Fed might come to the rescue.
 If economic conditions get much worse and the Fed is ''more comfortable with the inflation outlook, that's a catalyst for an eventual easing in monetary policy,'' said Richard Berner, chief United States economist with Morgan Stanley. ''But we're not there yet.''

HEADLINE: The Almighty Ruble

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
The ruble got no respect. 
 During the cold war, it symbolized the backward Soviet economy. After the U.S.S.R. collapsed, it was an avatar of instability. Even plumbers in Moscow often preferred to be paid in bottles of vodka rather than rubles -- the bottles did not lose their value. 
 No more. Lifted by high oil prices and a wave of foreign investment, the once humble ruble is showing its muscle, and fueling a consumer boom. 
 After gaining 20 percent in value against the dollar in the last few years, the ruble is even starting to displace the greenback as Russians' currency of choice for both saving and spending. 
 As the ruble increases in value -- not just against the dollar, but against brawnier currencies, too, like the euro -- imported goods are becoming cheaper for Russian consumers. Now ruble notes, once handed over by the fistful for a loaf of bread, are being used to purchase Mercedeses, flat-screen televisions and European beach vacations.
 Of course, the party could be short-lived. Russia takes in roughly $530 million a day from oil, its most lucrative export. If the price of oil declines, so will the ruble. And even if the price of oil does not fall, an oil-fueled boom brings dangers of its own. In many countries, an over-reliance on petrodollars has led to underinvestment in businesses outside oil and gas, and a subsequent withering of other domestic industries. 
 To deal with such downsides of the ruble's rise, Russia is salting away oil money in a rainy day fund, called the Stabilization Fund, which holds more than $120 billion. In January, Moscow will split it into two funds: the Reserve Fund and the Fund of National Prosperity, the latter intended for state investments. 
 Together with the Central Bank of Russia's foreign reserves, Russian authorities have a currency reserve of $413 billion, the largest per capita foreign currency reserve of any major economy, including China's. In an oil downturn, authorities could spend that reserve to protect the ruble. 
 In the meantime, the reserve adds an aura of stability to the economy for investors. 
 ''Excluding a couple of oil countries where the money belongs to the local ruling family, which is something different, Russia has surpassed all the newly industrializing Asian countries,'' in foreign currency reserves, Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard, said in a telephone interview. 
 Analysts say Russia's underlying fundamentals are good, too. 
 First, oil exports are not the sole source of the ruble's rise. That was the case before 2007, but now foreign investment has become a significant factor. Private capital flows into Russia increased roughly 360 percent in the first six months of this year, compared with the same period last year. Only about 30 percent is attributable to oil and other extractive industries, according to the State Statistics Committee.
 Analysts also point to what they call Russia's sound macroeconomics. President Vladimir V. Putin's government has managed inflation, though certainly not eliminated it. And through its tight control over politics and society, the regime has kept demands for social spending in check -- a leadership approach reminiscent of the authoritarian ''Asian model'' of economic development.
 But economists also say a long-term cycle of economic depression and recovery is bolstering the ruble, at least for now. Starting in 1990, the year the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia's economy contracted by as much as 40 percent. This year, for the first time since, Russia's gross domestic product returned to 1990 levels: factories, oil pipelines, roads, ports and other facilities that once were idled are operating near full capacity. 
 In the decade from January 1993 to Dec. 31, 2002, the ruble's lowest point, the dollar appreciated 7,664 percent against the ruble, rising to 31.96 rubles to the dollar. On Tuesday, one dollar bought 25.47 rubles, a 20 percent appreciation for the ruble. 
 Even more important, as measured by purchasing power parity, a gauge of a currency's value based on the goods it can buy, a dollar should buy roughly 15 rubles today, according to a report Merrill Lynch issued in July. By that measure, the ruble remains the world's second-most undervalued major currency, behind only the Chinese yuan, whose value has given policy makers in Washington headaches. 
 Indeed, the ruble would be even more valuable today if not for the Russian central bank intervening to keep it from rising more.
 Through much of the 1990s, Russia suffered the opposite problem. Then the ruble, shunned by locals and tourists alike, was propped up by Western lending. It collapsed in 1998, on the heels of the Asian economic crisis. Russians' life savings evaporated and poverty became widespread. 
 In just one example, the theft of manhole covers became a major problem. Russians were stealing them to sell for scrap metal.
 All that is different now. The current consumer boom has sparked renewed interest in Russia from companies like Wal-Mart and Starbucks. Indeed, shares in grocery stores, electronic retailers and other consumer-sector companies are outperforming Russian oil companies on the Moscow stock exchange. 
 Russian banks offer accounts in rubles, dollars or euros. Of the three, ruble accounts are attracting the most funds. Ruble-denominated personal savings accounts rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2007, while foreign currency accounts were level, according to a report by Goldman Sachs. 
 That has led to some, perhaps predictable, gloating. Recently, a pro-Kremlin youth group staged a mock panhandling to benefit the United States currency. They held out hats for passers-by to make donations -- ''raising money for the dollar's ticket back home,'' their signs read.
 But there are limits as to how far a currency can carry a country. Real economic growth, economists say, will depend on continuing foreign investment. Without it, Russian consumption of imported goods will outpace earnings from oil by 2010, according to Russia's finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin. 
 If that happens, Russia's economy will depend on foreign investment to maintain the strong ruble and the rising living standards associated with it -- much as the United States does, but without the same record of stability. 
 Last summer, authorities eliminated all restrictions on ruble trading, making the currency fully convertible and easing the way for the capital inflow needed to meet the demand. In the first six months of this year, net private capital inflow into Russia was $67.1 billion -- more than during the entire first decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the same period last year, capital inflow was $14.5 billion. 
 While threats of nationalization persist in the oil sector, investors have largely decided that they are acceptable considering the money to be made. 
 In another recent sign of the ruble's strength, a particularly Russian enterprise has just become more expensive. 
 Russia has raised the price for a tourist flight to the International Space Station aboard a Russian rocket. What cost Dennis A. Tito, the first space tourist, $20 million in 2001, this year cost the former Microsoft executive Charles Simonyi $25 million. Citing the strong ruble, Russian space agency officials say they will increase that fee to $30 million.

HEADLINE: Ethanol Is Feeding Hot Market for Farmland

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: DEKALB, Ill. 

 BODY:
While much of the nation worries about a slumping real estate market, people in Midwestern farm country are experiencing exactly the opposite. Take, for instance, the farm here -- nearly 80 acres of corn and soybeans off a gravel road in a universe of corn and soybeans -- that sold for $10,000 an acre at auction this spring, a price that astonished even the auctioneer.
 ''If they had seen that day, they would have never believed it,'' Penny Layman said of her sister and brother-in-law, who paid $32,000 for the entire spread in 1962 and whose deaths led to the sale. 
 Skyrocketing farmland prices, particularly in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, giddy with the promise of corn-based ethanol, are stirring new optimism among established farmers. But for younger farmers, already rare in this graying profession, and for small farmers with dreams of expanding and grabbing a piece of the ethanol craze, the news is oddly grim. The higher prices feel out of reach. 
 ''It's extremely frustrating,'' said Paul Burrs, who farms about 400 acres near Dixon, Ill., and says he regularly bids on new farmland in the hopes of renting it. Mostly, he said, he loses out to higher bidders. ''I crunch the numbers and go as high as I can. But then that's it. There's nothing more I can do.''
 Mr. Burrs, who is 28, had a grandfather and a stepgrandfather who farmed. ''So I guess it's in my blood,'' he said, ''that feeling that you've got to do this, you were meant to do this.''
 Still, he said, he believes that to make it a viable, ''not quite so lean'' full-time career, he needs to work more acres. Just the other day, he called about a farm that was up for rent. He did not get it. 
 ''You keep trying to fight your battles,'' Mr. Burrs said, ''but it's frustrating and hard, and sometimes I think, 'Why am I doing this?' ''
 In central Illinois, prime farmland is selling for about $5,000 an acre on average, up from just over $3,000 an acre five years ago, a study showed. In Nebraska, meanwhile, land values rose 17 percent in the first quarter of this year over the same time last year, the swiftest such gain in more than a quarter century, said Jason R. Henderson, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City.
 A federal-government analysis of farm real estate values released Friday showed record average-per-acre values across the country. The analysis said property prices averaged $2,160 an acre at the start of 2007, up 14 percent from a year earlier.
 ''For everyone who owns an acre of land, we love this,'' said Dale E. Aupperle, a professional farm manager and real estate consultant in Decatur, Ill., who said the rising land values were being driven by rising commodity prices (though corn has dropped some since June) and the prospect of increased demand for ethanol. 
 ''For everyone who doesn't own an acre of land, these prices mean it gets a little harder to get into,'' Mr. Aupperle added. ''For an entry-level land owner or a renter, there's a bit of a thought right now that the train is leaving and I'm not on it.''
 In Iowa, which produces more corn and is home to more ethanol plants than any other state, farm rental prices are mimicking purchase prices: they were up about 10 percent this spring over a year ago, according to a study by William Edwards, a professor at Iowa State University who said it was the largest jump since he started tracking farm rents in 1994.
 And ethanol is leaving marks everywhere. New grain bins seem to be popping up all around the Midwest, farmers from Indiana to South Dakota say, and some of the highest farmland prices have been seen around the nearly 200 existing or proposed ethanol plants, where the cost of transporting the corn would be the cheapest. Mr. Henderson said he heard that land close to such facilities, most of which are in the Midwest, had jumped by as much as 30 percent over a year ago.
 Some of the boom here may be tied to the dip in other urban and suburban markets: As has been true for several years, out-of-town investors (some of whom can put off capital gains taxes by taking money made from selling one piece of real estate and investing it in another) are buying some of this land. But local farmers are doing much of the buying this year, said Lee Vermeer, a vice president of real estate operations at Farmers National Company, a farm-management firm in Omaha.
 ''These are established farmers, though, who own other land,'' Mr. Vermeer said. ''For a young farmer to get in, the amount of capital required is almost prohibitive.''
 So the land prices are, in some cases, scooting beyond reach, even as young corn farmers -- and hopeful farmers -- are enticed by the sudden demand for ethanol as a replacement for the nation's dependence on oil. 
 Near Dixon, 40 miles west of DeKalb, Kyle Sheaffer, 28, serves as the local leader of a Farm Bureau committee focused on the worries of young farmers. For them, he said, the high prices have become a regular focus of concern. Meanwhile, well-off buyers and investors, he said, seem to arrive in places like Dixon with ''an open checkbook.''
 ''At this point, it's just super hard to rent -- much less buy -- ground,'' Mr. Sheaffer said. ''On top of the land, the initial investment to farm is so much: the tractor, the startup costs, it's crazy. If you want to rent land, you either have to find a landlord who is sympathetic to your cause or who knows you.''
 Without a family member who already owns a farm or without having a personal connection with a retiring community farmer, there is little chance of a young farmer getting in, most farmers here said. Mr. Sheaffer himself farms 2,500 acres of corn and soybeans, with his father. Without the family tie, he said, he would be out of luck. 
 Brent Johnson, 29, a farmer in Ashland, Ill., said the established operation run by his father and uncle are the only reason he can even consider farming. 
 ''I don't know anyone anymore who is doing this who didn't come from a farm,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Starting one up from thin air? I don't know how you could now.''
 Not surprisingly, the farmers are aging. In Iowa, about one-fourth of farmland is owned by people 75 or older, said Michael Duffy, a farm economist at Iowa State University. Another one-fourth is owned by people 65 to 74 years old.
 Unknown is what will come of land prices if corn loses its place in the ethanol world and is surpassed by another source like cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass.
 ''Right now, a lot are still betting that corn-based ethanol will be around a while,'' said Mr. Duffy, who is also the director of the Beginning Farmer Center, which assists farmers who are starting out. He noted two other farming booms, in the 1910s and the 1970s, which were each later followed by periods of depression.
 ''In five years, corn-based ethanol will be around,'' Mr. Duffy said. ''Fifteen years? I'm not as convinced.''

HEADLINE: Some Words About Interpreting

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
It is high time to dethrone ''plastics'' as the most famous one-word career tip in history. On the 40th anniversary of the release of ''The Graduate,'' in which Dustin Hoffman puzzled over that advice, I would urge fledgling entrepreneurs to consider one of the most lucrative hidden-in-plain-sight niches of the global economy.
 Interpreters. 
 O.K., that may not have quite the same ring, but think about it. While everybody else is talking about booming international markets for information technology, banking, jetliners and fast-food restaurants, who are the mechanics who keep the machinery of world trade humming? 
 The people who enable speakers of English, French, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish and every other language from Arabic to Zulu to understand one another, that's who. As a result, a cottage industry of small and medium-size language-services companies is quietly flourishing in this country. Here is a glance at two of them:
 Kathleen Diamond founded Language Learning Enterprise in Alexandria, Va., in 1979 almost by accident. Fluent in English, French and Spanish, she had always been encouraged by her father, a corporate executive, to ''think beyond the obvious possibilities,'' she said. But she never considered herself entrepreneurial material.
 Au contraire, she seemed to be coasting in early adulthood along a predictable middle-class path, marrying, having two children and holding down intermittent teaching jobs.
 Then, the proverbial light bulb went off. In 1979, Berlitz offered her $4.25 an hour to teach French to students who were paying $25 each for the lesson. Assuming a class of 10 students, well, you do the math.
 ''It was that huge gap that set off something in me,'' she said.
 Fate gave her a push. By chance, she said, she saw a newspaper ad for a program for women on starting businesses. She enrolled and before long opened a language-instruction company for adults.
 Her first federal government contract was with the United States Information Agency. It asked to see her facility. Facility? What facility? Before you could say the proverbial ''la plume de ma tante est sur la table de mon oncle,'' she cut a deal to rent a church's Sunday School classrooms on weekdays. 
 From that beginning, she branched out into translation, then into sending interpreters to hospitals and the like and finally, in what was to become her big moneymaker, into providing interpretation services over the phone.
 Today, Language Learning's 35 employees manage 3,000 interpreters and translators, most of them in the United States, Britain and Canada, but also in Argentina, Russia, China, India and other countries. These independent contractors can be called on at a moment's notice to assist Language Learning's clients, which include the Homeland Security Department, major corporations, financial institutions, hospitals and numerous states and counties.
 Most of the interpreters hired by Language Learning are immigrants, and most live in the United States because, Ms. Diamond says, they have to understand American lingo, culture and traditions.
 She foresees a golden age for language services. Right now, her venture centers on interpreting English into Spanish, followed by Mandarin Chinese, Korean and Russian. But she considers China to be a land of opportunity, with Mandarin eventually becoming a rival to English at the center of the linguistic orbit -- just as China is emerging as an economic force that is expected to play a larger and larger role in the global marketplace.
 Ms. Diamond, who is 60, says Language Learning is on track to take in $9 million in revenue this year, up from $5.8 million last year, a turning point after years of gradual gains. She says her profit margins are ''strong.'' 
 ''We've reached the stage where we can say this company has real staying power,'' she said. ''So let's let her rip!''
 It is doubtful, however, that she will ever catch up with her far bigger competitor, Language Line Services, the world's leading over-the-phone interpretation provider. The privately held company is based in Monterey, Calif. Louis Provenzano, Language Line's chief executive, recently started an effort to double his full-time work force to 6,000 from 3,000 over two years, and expects revenue to increase at a similar pace. He says his company is ''highly profitable.''
 No wonder: The market potential for language services in the United States is huge and growing, but the industry, which is made up of mostly small niche players, can't keep up with the demand. It doesn't even have a trade association. 
 Mr. Provenzano says that Language Line has 20,000 customers around the world, including hospitals, police departments and credit card companies, with its biggest presence in English-speaking countries. He says his interpreters help police officers and other emergency workers deliver an average of 10 babies a day.
 Why the explosion in demand? ''Every 31 seconds, another immigrant enters the U.S.,'' he said. ''One fifth of the people who live in the U.S. speak another language than English at home.''
 Moreover, he adds, ''those global companies that offer their services in potential customers' native language are four times more likely to make a sale than competitors who do not.''
 To that end, Language Line (started 25 years ago by a police officer named Jeff Munks, with a business partner, out of his frustration in trying to communicate with Vietnamese refugees) has joined forces with AT&T to offer the public a free service called Your World, Your Language. The service, now being test-marketed in California, allows users to choose one of nine languages to communicate with service providers from banks and insurance firms to telephone and utility companies.
 In partnership with Verizon Communications, Language Line also recently began marketing a prepaid card called Verizon Interpretation aimed at American business travelers abroad who can use it to gain instant access to interpreters of English into any language.
 Israel Hernandez, who runs the U.S. Commercial Service, a part of the Commerce Department that promotes exports, notes that more than 70 percent of the world's purchasing power lies outside the United States. 
 ''With English being the language of international business,'' he said, ''Language Learning Enterprise and Language Line Services have indeed found a potential pot of gold.''

HEADLINE: A Weak Dollar and the Fed

 BODY:
Despite the Federal Reserve's stay-the-course message yesterday, investors are betting on at least one interest-rate cut by January, intended to quell turmoil in the markets and to juice the slow economy. But with the dollar also weak -- recently hitting its lowest point in 15 years against an index of other major currencies -- the Fed may be reluctant to oblige. 
 A declining dollar is a source of inflationary pressure because it can boost the cost of imports. So if the Fed tried to rev up the economy with a rate cut at the same time the dollar is falling, it could end up provoking even more inflation. That would be a drag on economic growth rather than a boost. In an extreme case, it could result in a toxic combination of weak growth and high prices that is a central banker's nightmare.
 How did the Fed lose room to maneuver? The answer is rooted in the Bush administration's misguided economic policies. 
 Over the last several years, America's imbalances in trade and other global transactions have worsened dramatically, requiring the United States to borrow billions of dollars a day from abroad just to balance its books. 
 The only lasting way to fix the imbalances -- and reduce that borrowing -- is to increase America's savings. But the administration has steadfastly rejected that responsible approach since it would require rolling back excessive tax cuts and engaging in government-led health care reform to rein in looming crushing costs -- both, anathema to President Bush. It would also require revamping the nation's tax incentives so that they create new savings by typical families, instead of new shelters for the existing wealth of affluent families -- another nonstarter for this White House. 
 Stymied by what it won't do, the administration has gone for a quicker fix -- letting the dollar slide. A weaker dollar helps to ease the nation's imbalances by making American exports more affordable, thus narrowing the trade deficit. 
 But to be truly effective, a weaker dollar must be paired with higher domestic savings. Otherwise, the need to borrow from abroad remains large, even as a weakening currency makes dollar-based debt less attractive. That's the trap the nation is slipping into today. Among other ills, it could lead to a deterioration in American living standards as money flows abroad to pay foreign creditors, leaving less to spend at home on critical needs. Or, it could lead to abrupt spikes in interest rates as American debtors are forced to pay whatever it takes to get the loans they need. 
 In volatile economic times like now, leadership is crucial -- and notably absent with this administration. Officials have made no effort to orchestrate a more coordinated and comprehensive realignment of the world's currencies, in part, it seems, because the administration is unwilling to have America do its part by saving more.
 In the absence of leadership from the White House, the presidential candidates could elevate the issue, outlining their own plans to boost savings. 
 But until the administration -- either this one or the next -- is willing to acknowledge the source of the economy's imbalances, and starts addressing them seriously, the dollar is likely to remain weak. And the Fed's ability to maneuver will be constrained.

HEADLINE: Investors Heartened by Fed Position

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks made a late-day surge yesterday as Wall Street interpreted the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates at current levels as a sign that the economy was not threatened by turmoil in the credit markets. 
 Investors were at first deeply disappointed that policy makers, who kept benchmark rates steady at 5.25 percent, did not hint at a possible cut. But the Dow Jones industrial average rose into positive territory, from a 121-point deficit right after the decision was announced, when investors digested the policy statement and were reassured that the economy was likely to withstand troubles in the mortgage industry.
 The Dow gained 35.52, or 0.26 percent, to 13,504.30, the first time since July 30 that it has not closed with a triple-digit gain or loss. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.04, or 0.62 percent, to 1,476.71, while the Nasdaq composite index was up 14.27, or 0.56 percent, to 2,561.60. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.74, or 1.01 percent, to 774.13.
 Treasury bonds fell as investors moved back into stocks; the benchmark 10-year note dropped 8/32, to 97 29/32, from 98 5/32 on Monday. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.77 percent, from 4.74 percent late Monday. 
 Light crude oil for September delivery was up 36 cents, to settle at $72.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. A week ago, crude closed at a record $78.21 a barrel.
 Wall Street was also pleased by a Labor Department report that indicated worker productivity increased last quarter as the economy rebounded, and labor costs began to retreat.
 Analysts said they found little new in the Fed's statement, and that in itself might have led to the market's volatility. Some investors were looking for a stronger statement about credit markets; others were listening for indications of a rate cut or signs that inflation was waning.
 ''Nobody was surprised at the Fed's language. There wasn't any positive or really negative news,'' said P. Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist for TIAA-CREF. 
 In corporate news, Marsh & McLennan, the largest American insurance brokerage firm, fell $1.54 a share, to $26.11, despite a 3 percent increase in its second-quarter profits. The company also approved a $1.5 billion share-repurchase plan.
 Duke Energy rose 96 cents a share, to $18.86. It reported that second-quarter profit fell 17 percent after the company spun off its natural gas business.
 Tyco International shed 56 cents a share, to $47.44, after it posted a fiscal third-quarter loss on hefty charges, primarily related to a legal settlement. Adjusted results exceeded Wall Street's expectations, however.
 Advancing issues outpaced decliners three to two on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 4.71 billion shares, up from a heavy 5.09 billion Monday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Consumers Picked Up Pace of Borrowing in June

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Borrowing by American households rose more than forecast in June, as consumers turned to credit cards and nonmortgage loans to maintain spending.
 Consumer credit increased $13.2 billion during the month, to $2.46 trillion, after a $15.9 billion gain in May that was larger than previously reported, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday. Borrowing increased at a 6.5 percent annual rate in June, after rising at a 7.9 percent pace in May. 
 Slumping home values and stricter lending standards have made it harder for Americans to borrow against their homes for extra cash.
 ''Consumers are relying a bit more on credit cards and other types of loans because home equity is less available,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. ''Consumer spending will still be on the sluggish side in the second half.''
 Revolving loans like credit card debt rose $6.3 billion in June, Tuesday's report showed. Nonrevolving debt, including auto loans, rose $6.9 billion.
 Another government report showed that worker productivity gained less than was forecast in the second quarter, and that labor costs rose. Productivity, a gauge of employee efficiency, advanced at an annual rate of 1.8 percent after a revised 0.7 percent gain in the previous three months, the Labor Department said Tuesday. A measure of wages and benefits increased at a 2.1 percent pace, more than anticipated.
 Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent last quarter, the weakest pace in more than a year and down from a 3.7 percent pace in the first six months of the year.
 The quarter also ended on a poor note as spending rose just 0.1 percent in June after a 0.6 percent gain a month earlier.
 Two-thirds of economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators this month said they had lowered their consumer spending forecast since the July survey.
 But some economists saw the jump in credit as a positive signal that most borrowers were not being turned away by banks.
 ''We have little concern about the outlook for spending,'' said Michael R. Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colo. ''There is no evidence of a seizing up in lending. Most borrowers are seeing no evidence of a change in their ability to obtain credit.''

HEADLINE: Giving Bottles a Second Life

 BODY:
Not long ago, we argued in this space that because America has some of the best tap water available, it is time to start thinking twice about drinking commercially bottled water. One big reason is that a lot of petroleum is required to manufacture and transport the plastic bottles, thus adding to global warming and other environmental problems. Of course, in certain circumstances bottled water is necessary. It is essential during emergencies -- think Katrina -- and it is certainly a better alternative when the only other drinks come loaded with calories. 
 What the rising use of bottled water leaves us with, however, is a huge recycling problem. Of the mountain of individual plastic water bottles created by Americans each year -- including enough to hold more than seven billion gallons of water -- less than one-fourth are sent to the recycling industry for a second round.
 That makes absolutely no sense for the environment or for the economy. 
 The recycling industry sees plastic water bottles as a prime commodity because they can be turned into anything from fleece jackets to a very durable set of luggage. One reason so few water bottles are recycled is that except in a very few states, they cannot be redeemed at the local grocery store. 
 Recycling rates are significantly higher in the 11 states that pay customers a nickel (and in some cases a dime) if they return their bottle. But only three of these states -- California, Hawaii and Maine -- include water bottles. Passing new bottle laws or expanding old laws to include plastic bottles should be an easy call for most Legislatures. But the grocery and drink industry have been able to use their clout, and campaign funds, to keep that from happening. That needs to change.
 There are other ways to encourage recycling. At many public places -- ballgames or city parks, for example -- it is often much easier to buy a bottle of water than to find a recycling bin to throw it away. And in some areas, like parts of Philadelphia, officials are experimenting with ways to pay homeowners by the pound for recycled trash, a trend definitely worth watching.
 Of course, for most people, the simplest recycling solution of all might be to wash a plastic bottle out and refill it with fresh water from the tap.

HEADLINE: Free Lunch On Health? Think Again

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The great hope of every health care reformer is that better care will mean cheaper care.
 The three leading Democrats running for president have all put this idea at the center of their plans. Rudy Giuliani, the first Republican candidate to offer some health care ideas, has talked about it, too.
 The theory goes like this: By practicing preventive medicine, doctors can keep many people from getting sick in the first place. Those who do end up with a chronic illness will be closely tracked so that fewer of them develop complications. These steps will result in less illness, which in turn will require less health care. With the savings, the country can then lower its medical bills or provide health insurance for the 40-odd million people who lack it -- or maybe even both. 
 As Hillary Clinton recently told The Atlantic, it's possible to ''save money and improve quality and cover everybody.'' 
 The would-be reformers have hit on something important here. The current health care system doesn't pay hospitals, doctors and nurses to keep people healthy; it pays for tests, surgeries and drugs. So Americans often get expensive invasive care of dubious medical benefit while missing out on sensible basic care. Millions of other people go without any care for chronic illnesses like heart disease and diabetes. If Medicare and private insurers paid for more preventive care, Americans would be healthier than they are today and live longer.
 But the current presidential candidates go one step further. They don't merely argue that preventive care delivers good bang for the buck. They argue that it delivers good bang for no bucks whatsoever. And this is where the candidates are overreaching. 
 No one really knows whether preventive medicine will save money in the long run, let alone free up the billions of dollars a year needed to help pay for universal health insurance. In fact, studies have shown that preventive care -- be it cancer screening, smoking cessation or plain old checkups -- usually ends up costing money. It makes people healthier, but it's not free.
 ''It's a nice thing to think, and it seems like it should be true, but I don't know of any evidence that preventive care actually saves money,'' said Jonathan Gruber, an M.I.T. economist who helped design the universal-coverage plan in Massachusetts. 
 This is a tough idea to swallow because better health really does seem as if it should lead to lower medical bills. Indeed, if it were somehow possible to wave a wand and turn people into thin nonsmokers who remembered to take their statins, this country's health care expenses would fall.
 But any effort to promote health has its own costs. Doctors and nurses need to spend time with patients to persuade them to change their behavior. (Ever tried to get someone to stop smoking or drinking?) For a new program to work, it has to reach people who are not being helped by whatever exists now -- and who thus will be among the most difficult and expensive patients to treat. The program would also have to treat a whole lot of people who never would have gotten sick. 
 Jay Bhattacharya, a doctor and economist at Stanford's School of Medicine, estimates that to prevent one new case of diabetes, an antiobesity program must treat five people -- ''not cheaply,'' he says. Along the same lines, Mr. Gruber found that when retirees in California began visiting their doctor less often and filling fewer prescriptions, overall medical spending fell. People did get sick more often, but treating their illnesses was still less costly than widespread basic care -- in the form of doctors visits and drugs. Louise Russell, an economist at Rutgers, points out that programs that focus on at-risk patients cost the least, but even they are rarely free.
 As Dr. Mark R. Chassin, a former New York state health commissioner, says, preventive care ''reduces costs, yes, for the individual who didn't get sick.''
 ''But that savings is overwhelmed by the cost of continuously treating everybody else.'' 
 The actual savings are also not as large as might at first seem. Even if you don't develop diabetes, your lifetime medical costs won't drop to zero. You might live longer and better and yet still ultimately run up almost as big a lifetime medical bill, because you'll eventually have other problems. That would be an undeniably better outcome, but it wouldn't produce a financial windfall for society.
 Certainly, there are examples of preventive care that can save money. As Mrs. Clinton has noted, Safeway and a handful of other companies have held down health costs by emphasizing prevention. (This, of course, is only over the short term.) Perhaps the best examples fall under the category of what Dr. Brent C. James calls ''do it right the first time.''
 Dr. James is an executive at Intermountain Healthcare, a network of hospitals in Utah and Idaho that has saved money in recent years by reducing hospital infections and drug errors. Intermountain hospitals have also largely stopped inducing child labor for the sake of doctors' or parents' convenience. The hospital induces birth only for medical reasons -- and the number of babies that spend time in the neonatal intensive care unit has fallen.
 It's this last example that holds the real key to cutting medical costs. I realize many people will react to the notion that preventive care usually costs money by saying, ''So what? We should do it anyway.'' And we should.
 But by describing it as an easy win-win solution, the presidential candidates are gliding over an important part of the issue. Preventive care saves real money only when it replaces existing care that is expensive and doesn't do much, if any, good. There are plenty of examples of such care -- from induced labor to many lumbar surgeries and cardiac stent procedures. 
 The problem is that the people getting this care typically don't consider it wasteful. We all like to believe that other people are the ones getting the unnecessary care. We, on the other hand, are probably not getting enough treatment.
 Persuading people otherwise -- persuading them that basic care is sometimes cheaper and better -- will be difficult. Sometimes insurance plans will simply have to say no to questionable care, over the opposition of doctors' groups with a financial interest in the status quo. But it's the only way to ''save money and improve quality and cover everybody,'' as Mrs. Clinton says. 
 She and her rivals, John Edwards and Barack Obama, deserve a lot of credit for laying out such detailed, promising reform plans. Mrs. Clinton has gone so far as to say that ''too much of the money we spend is wasted on care that doesn't improve health.'' But the candidates are still avoiding the toughest part of the discussion: when and how to say no. 
 ''Fundamentally, if you're going to control health care costs, it involves denying people care they want -- or things they've been trained to think they want,'' Mr. Gruber says. ''There is no easy answer.''

HEADLINE: Reader Responses

 BODY:
Here are excerpts from reader responses to David Leonhardt's Aug. 8 column on preventive medicine:
 You compare the costs the health-care system incurs to prevent illness with those it incurs to treat people who are ill. But in common with everyone else who discusses health care, you neglect to mention the other costs of being ill: lost productivity, lost pay, reduced tax collections, reduced consumer buying, you name it. Without taking into account these costs, any discussion is meaningless. -- David Hawkins
 I see your point. Productivity gains do sometimes overwhelm the costs of preventive care. But they don't always do so, and the savings often don't accrue to the people who have to pay for the care. -- David Leonhardt 
 I very much respect the columns you have been writing on health care. Today's is no exception. I want to weigh in on the cost issue from my point of view as a longtime advocate for health research.
 It has been established that Americans are receiving the right health care (including preventive care) only about one-third of the time -- the other times we are either getting no care or the wrong care. And that only includes the ''wrong care'' that we know about so far -- there is a lot still to know about what works and what doesn't -- and the kind of research that sorts that out is health-services research. We currently spend about $6,700 per American per year on health care, but only $1 per American per year on health services research. We not only need to conduct more health-services research, including ''outcomes'' research, but we need to make the results of that research -- including that which has already been conducted -- available to patients, providers, insurers, employers and federal and state agencies. We can't expect people to receive the right care if they don't know what it actually is. 
 -- Mary Woolley
 Some astounding fraction of an individual's health-care costs is spent in the last year of life. This, of course, suggests that improved preventative care, while perhaps extending the average life by five years, would only slow the increase of medical costs for five years if instituted for everyone. After all, if 30 percent of your health-care costs are still being spent in the last year of your life, those costs will remain the same without some kind of intervention in this period of your life. -- Ray Hoobler
 David, your reasoning fails to take into consideration the time value of money. If I can delay needing expensive health care for 20 years, the money my insurer would have spent on me in 2007 would be invested for 20 years, making a compounded return that (hopefully) exceeds the medical inflation rate. And so, even if the health care I need in 2027 has the same medical-inflation-rate-adjusted cost as the care I would have received in 2007, the insurance company still comes out ahead. Of course, it's always possible that the care I need in 2027 is more expensive because my disease is more expensive to treat ... but its also possible that I get hit by a truck in 2027 and die instantly and go straight to the city morgue. Unless you have solid data on the variation in the cost of care for the ways people die at 50 vs. 70 vs. 90, I don't think its possible to say if it's a net economic win or loss for the insurance company. 
 -- John Lazzaro
 The time value can certainly make a difference. My point was that avoiding $100,000 in medical costs over the next five years often doesn't equal $100,000 in net savings. -- David Leonhardt
 The reason that candidates are saying they want preventative care is that it enables them to keep the current health-care system in place, while in effect blaming the citizens for the high cost of health care. The so-called ''preventative'' care they are advocating will allow them to get more control of people. Here is how they are going to get more control of people: There are already companies that are punishing employees in the form of fines for not adhering to certain heath metrics. There are already companies firing employees for smoking. There are companies that are pre-screening employees by forcing them to take mandatory tests. ''Preventative'' care will be the code word for gathering information on people. And they will take the new mandate for preventative care to test people more, which will find more reasons to prescribe drugs, which will boost drug sales.
 -- Joe Gagan

HEADLINE: Investors Lining Up for Pieces of Seattle's Comeback

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
The Seattle office market has made a spectacular recovery in the last few years. As a result many real estate investors want to park their money there. No one knows that better than Alfred Clise.
 His real estate investment company, Clise Properties, is selling a 13-acre parcel in downtown Seattle that his family cobbled together over 80 years. The land, amounting to nearly seven blocks, now mainly occupied by parking lots and low-rise office buildings, has no asking price.
 Still, there have been plenty of suitors. Mr. Clise has fielded 69 requests for tours since he put the parcel on the market in June. It is the biggest piece of land for sale in any downtown in the country, brokers say, and could sell for as much as $1 billion, according to an estimate by Real Capital Analytics, a national research and consulting company.
 The Clises, one of Seattle's oldest families, won't sell to just anyone. The buyer, if one emerges by the family's October deadline, must have a grand vision for the parcel -- a development like Rockefeller Center in New York or Canary Wharf in London -- or the family will not part with the land. Family members say they will not sell it in pieces. 
 ''You really can do anything you want with it'' because it is already zoned for a wide variety of uses, said Mr. Clise, chairman and chief executive of Clise Properties and the fourth generation to run the company. ''It'll have a major impact and reshape the city.'' A buyer could put as much as 14 million square feet of offices, condominiums and rental apartments on the parcel.
 Seattle is now on every investor's shopping list. This year, the city was deemed the best place in the country to buy and sell office buildings in the Urban Land Institute's annual survey of real estate professionals. Office vacancies are at a six-year low of 7.7 percent, and downtown landlords are getting as much as $50 a square foot annually, according to Grubb & Ellis, a real estate brokerage firm.
 Booming trade with Asia and a recovery in the job market are the secrets behind the rosy office market. Blue-chip companies like Starbucks, Amazon.com and Microsoft call the Seattle area home and have been steadily hiring thousands of new workers and funneling millions into the local economy.Boeing demoralized the city when it moved its headquarters to Chicago a few years ago, but it still has extensive production operations in the area.
 The unemployment rate has slipped by two percentage points, to 4 percent, in the last few years, and Seattle seems to be doing better than ever.
 ''It's not just Microsoft and Boeing,'' said Kelly Mann, executive director of the Urban Land Institute's Seattle office. ''It's Starbucks, Costco and a wide array of small companies that were started by people from those corporations that are driving the growth.''
 It is a big change from a few years ago. Seattle's economy, hammered by the tech bust and a drop-off in jet orders after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, was on life support. Computer programmers, who had fielded multiple job offers only a year before, were suddenly out of work. Tens of thousands of people were laid off. Vacancy rates for offices topped out at 18 percent, rents sank to $26.30 a square foot and new construction ground to a halt. 
 Then, three years ago, Seattle emerged from its economic deep freeze. Companies resumed hiring, developers started building and the port handled record cargo shipments. The recession, which hit Seattle harder and lasted longer there than elsewhere in the country, was finally over.
 The current construction surge might eclipse the last one. There are now 31 projects, with more than 7.5 million square feet of space, on the books in the city. In a previous construction boom that ended in 2001, more than four million square feet of office space was built.
 A zoning change that occurred last year may help. In April 2006, the City Council allowed office, apartment and condo buildings to go as high as 500 feet in parts of downtown, up from an earlier maximum of 360 feet. Mr. Clise's parcel sits squarely in that section.
 There are now 13 office buildings, with 1.9 million square feet, under construction. Four of them have no signed tenants. In the last nine months, developers have started jockeying to get their buildings out of the ground first. Some of these developers had never put up office towers in Seattle without signed tenants.
 Vulcan Real Estate, a company owned by Paul Allen, Microsoft's co-founder, was the first to build; in November, it began work on 2201 Westlake, two towers with offices, condominiums and ground-floor retailing. 
 ''Usually, it's the people who go early who do well and the people who are late to the party who don't do well,'' said Ada Healey, Vulcan's vice president for real estate. ''We wanted to be one of the first guys out of the ground.'' 
 Vulcan's bet may pay off. Little new space will open until 2009, and rents are expected to soar as companies expand and take more space. Beacon Capital Partners, a major owner of office buildings nationwide, which became the area's biggest landlord when it bought 14 buildings from the Blackstone Group in April, has been pushing up rents in its building as leases expire. 
 In the next few years, vacancy rates are projected to bottom out at 4 percent. In such a tight market, tenants are being advised to renew their leases or start looking for space two years before their leases run out. Amazon.com is said to be seeking new space, brokers say, and is looking for as much as one million square feet downtown.
 ''When you're out looking for space with a tenant, you need to be ready to make a quick decision,'' said Peter Truex, a senior vice president at Colliers International in Seattle. 
 Prices for buildings in Seattle have soared, but that has not scared off investors -- just the reverse. In the last two years, prices for office space have climbed 60 percent, to an average of $338 a square foot, according to Real Capital Analytics. Just two weeks ago, prices hit a record of $668 a square foot when Tishman Speyer Properties sold two office buildings to BlackRock, a New York investment firm.
 Even historic buildings, which are sometimes outside prime locations and often lack modern amenities, are attracting intense interest. Ken Alhadeff, chairman of Elttaes Enterprises, his family's investment firm, received a dozen bids for five buildings downtown when he put them on the market last fall. Some of them are nearly a century old. They are not ones, Mr. Alhadeff said, that would usually attract institutional investors. 
 ''We got 20 percent higher than we had anticipated only six months earlier,'' Mr. Alhadeff said. His buyer, Principal Real Estate Investors of Des Moines, paid $62 million.
 Principal, which is the country's fourth-biggest institutional real estate manager, is looking for more buildings in Seattle. ''We see the market as one of the strongest in the country,'' said Rod Vogel, managing director of equity production at Principal.

HEADLINE: Should This Milk Be Legal?

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
THERE was the name of a Web site scrawled on cardboard and quickly torn to bits by an anonymous farmer in the Greenmarket at Union Square. Then came the paperwork, legal enough presumably, to protect the source of the illicit substance. Finally, Yaron Milgrom-Elcott received the monthly drop site: an address near Chelsea, open for two hours, show up or lose the white stuff.
 Mr. Milgrom-Elcott never missed a drop. Each month, he joined mothers with newborns and Wall Street titans in search of a box of unpasteurized, unhomogenized, raw milk. He is also part of a movement of perhaps hundreds of thousands across the country who will risk illness or even death to drink their milk the way Americans did for centuries: straight from the cow.
 Twenty years ago, the Food and Drug Administration banned interstate sales of unpasteurized milk. This spring the agency warned consumers again that they were risking their health drinking raw milk. 
 Still, individual states determine how raw milk is bought and sold within their borders. While its sale for human consumption is illegal in 15 states, New York is one of 26 where it can be bought with restrictions. The chief one is that raw milk can only be sold on the premises of one of 19 dairy farms approved by the state. Clandestine milk clubs, like the one Mr. Milgrom-Elcott joined, are one way of circumventing the law, and there are others.
 Raw milk drinkers may praise its richer flavor or claim it is more nutritious than pasteurized milk. No matter why they drink it, the demand for it is booming. In 2000, the Organic Pastures Dairy Company in the San Joaquin Valley near Fresno became California's first raw milk dairy with certified organic pasture land. This year its co-founder, Mark McAfee, expects it to gross $6 million -- up from $4.9 last year.
 His raw milk is sold in 300 stores in California, where it is legal. He also has an $80,000 a month mail order business, shipping creams and cheese as well as milk to all 50 states. He believes he reaches 35,000 customers a week for his raw milk products. Because the laws allow interstate shipping of raw milk that is not meant for human consumption, Organic Pastures milk is labeled as pet food. 
 ''I like to go into the warehouse and see the addresses -- it goes all over creation,'' he said. ''We don't have the same customers day in and day out. We're the entry point. We hear back that shipping is too expensive but that they found a local provider, either a farm or on the black market. They have got to have it.''
 Mr. McAfee said he knows firsthand of more than six dairies in Pennsylvania, some of them Amish, that supply the black market in New York and Boston. ''They're sending in 200 cases of milk every month,'' he said.
 Some drink it for the same reason raw milk cheeses are popular: the taste. ''I first discovered it two summers ago in France,'' said Mr. Milgrom-Elcott, who is pursuing a doctorate in medieval Jewish mysticism at New York University. ''There is a richness and density unlike processed milk, plus there's this complexity of flavor.''
 Others believe that it is good for them. Pasteurization -- a process of heating and quickly cooling milk to kill pathogens such as E. coli, salmonella and listeria -- also destroys beneficial bacteria, proteins and enzymes, they say. Advocates attribute stronger immune and better digestive systems to raw milk. Many have incorporated it into their diet as part of a broader philosophy to treat their bodies and the planet properly. 
 Nina Planck, the author of ''Real Food: What to Eat and Why,'' defied the F.D.A.'s warning and drank raw milk while she was pregnant. She not only continues to drink it while nursing her 9-month-old son, Julian, but also allows him the occasional sip. She has an arrangement with a couple of farmers to deliver it to New York City.
 ''We drink raw milk because we trust the traditional food chain more than the industrial one,'' said Ms. Planck, who knows a number of farmers from her days as director of the New York City Greenmarkets and through her boyfriend, Rob Kaufelt, the owner of Murray's Cheese in Greenwich Village. 
 ''We're willing to spend more money the higher up the food chain we go,'' she said. ''We're not alone, either. You cannot categorize the people who are drinking raw milk. They are people from the blue states and red states, farmers and yuppies and Birkenstock wearers.''
 Food scientists can hardly believe that so many consumers have turned their back on one of the most successful public health endeavors of the 20th century. In 1938, for example, milk caused 25 percent of all outbreaks of food- and water-related sickness. 
 With the advent of universal pasteurization, that number fell to 1 percent by 1993, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group in Washington. 
 David Barbano, director of the Northeast Dairy Foods Research Center, operated by Cornell and the University of Vermont and supported by the dairy industry, grew up drinking raw milk on a family farm. He does not remember ever getting sick, but says science has never found any evidence that it was more beneficial than pasteurized milk. In fact, he said, raw milk has very little vitamin D, which is added to most pasteurized milk.
 ''There is always going to be a percentage of raw milk that carries disease-causing bacteria,'' said Dr. Barbano, who is a professor of food science at Cornell. ''As long as I have pasteurized milk available for me, and I guess more importantly for my daughter, the risk is not worth any benefit anyone has been able to prove.''
 Sally Fallon, president of the Westin A. Price Foundation, another nutrition advocacy group, argues that the risk to raw milk drinkers is insignificant, and the demand for product is growing steadily. In 1998, when the Washington-based foundation created the Web site realmilk.com, it barely had half a page of sources where raw milk could be purchased legally. Now, the list has grown to more than two dozen pages, and Ms. Fallon puts the number of raw milk drinkers at half a million.
 ''We are trying to be pragmatic and create demand,'' said Ms. Fallon of the 10,000-member, 400-chapter foundation, which has mounted legal challenges to raw milk regulations in several states. ''Even though it is illegal in some places, it is very available through cow sharing or cow herding programs.''
 In Virginia, for example, Chip and Susan Planck -- Nina's parents -- pay $40 a year plus $25 monthly to own a share in one cow, the only legal way to get raw milk in that state. In return, they get a gallon of raw milk a week. It is technically not a sale but compensation for the cow's room and board. 
 Last year the Hawthorne Valley Farm in Ghent, N.Y., offered a buyers' club program to its raw milk customers in the hopes of giving a bigger boost to a steadily growing market. It was designed to encourage those customers in New York and beyond to order in bulk but send only one representative a week to pick up the order.
 When the New York State Department Public Interestand Markets caught wind of it, however, it asked Hawthorne to end the program and the farm complied. Still, Abe Madey, the farm's dairy manager and cheesemaker, says business is steady. About 100 regular customers, many of whom drive two hours from New York City, purchase up to 7,500 gallons annually of raw milk worth about $45,000 to the farm, he said.
 The milk club that Mr. Milgrom-Elcott belongs to, and others like it, is far more problematic, according to Jessica A. Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture and Markets department. She says the 41 milk inspectors charged with the monthly testing of New York's 5,000 dairy farms had not yet turned their attention to the clandestine dropoffs. 
 ''It is under review,'' said Ms. Chittenden, adding that the department cited five of the raw milk permit holders for violations in the past year. ''Our utmost concern is for public health. We are trying to insure that the safest products are out there.''
 For a few months anyhow, Mr. Milgrom-Elcott can shed his identity of a potential law-breaker. His wife, Miriam Sheinbein, just finished her third year at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and is currently serving a brief rotation in San Francisco. In California, raw milk is legal and widely available. While Ms. Sheinbein, who is 19 weeks pregnant, has decided to forego the delicacy until the baby is born, Mr. Milgrom-Elcott is delighted to take his habit above-ground. 
 ''It's hard to live without,'' he said.
 But then again, Mr. Milgrom-Elcott's secret life in New York was not without its thrills. 
 ''We also bought creme fraiche from the milk club,'' he said. ''It was nearly as ethereal as our fromager's in Aix-en-Provence.''

HEADLINE: Some Wonder if Cash for Good Test Scores Is the Wrong Kind of Lesson

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Should cash be used to spur children to do better on reading and math tests?
 Suzanne Windland, a homeowner raising three children in a placid enclave of eastern Queens, doesn't think so. Her seventh grader, Alexandra, she said, had perfect scores last year. But she doesn't want New York City's Department of Education to hand her $500 in spending cash for that achievement. That's what Alexandra would earn if her school was part of a pilot program that will reward fourth and seventh graders with $100 to $500, depending on how well they perform on 10 tests in the next year. 
 Mrs. Windland wants Alexandra to do well for all the timeless reasons -- to cultivate a love of learning, advance to more competitive schools and the like. She has on occasion bought her children toys or taken them out for dinner when they brought home pleasurable report cards, but she does not believe in dangling rewards beforehand. 
 ''It's like giving kids an allowance because they wake up every morning and brush their teeth and go off to school,'' she said. ''That's their job. That's what they're supposed to be doing.''
 Actually, Alexandra will probably not be eligible for the reward because the program, which has been adapted from a similar Mexican cash incentives plan, is aimed largely at schools with students from low-income families. Mrs. Windland, who grew up for a time on food stamps but now works as coordinator of volunteers for a social services agency, thinks it is unfair that Alexandra will see other seventh graders being rewarded for far lower scores, while she savors only the intangible plums of pride and satisfaction. 
 Mrs. Windland predicts that the impact of the program may be paradoxical, with resentment depressing the achievement of hard workers. 
 ''The kids who don't get reimbursed are going to say, 'Why should I bother!' '' Mrs. Windland said.
 There are parents who support the program. And Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein responds to skeptics by arguing that no one has figured out how to get more poorer children engaged in learning. Trumpeting the long-term benefits of education, the better jobs and lives well lived has not worked. Cash just might.
 ''There are lots of kids who think education is not relevant to them, who think education is a waste of time,'' he said in an interview.
 Still, critics warn Mr. Klein to be prepared for a backlash from families, both poor and more well off. The program will foster ''ill will,'' said Tim Johnson, chairman of the Chancellor's Parent Advisory Council, whose members include Mrs. Windland. 
 ''The word bribe comes to mind,'' he said. ''You certainly don't want kids with identical abilities, where one gets paid and the other doesn't.''
 Some parents, like Nakida Chambers-Camille, a school administrative assistant who lives in St. Albans, Queens, think the program should be given a shot. Ms. Chambers-Camille has a seventh grader, Leana, at a school that probably won't qualify. Leana, she chuckled, may think that is unfair. But Ms. Camille believes such sweeteners may ultimately benefit her daughter. ''If that's going to help the child my child is playing with, then I'm all for it,'' she said. ''I want my child associating with people who have education as a priority. If that child is not learning, that child will pull my child down with her.''
 But Mr. Klein also has some opponents in poorer communities that might benefit. Robert A. Reed Jr., president of the parents' association of Public School 46 in Harlem, a school where nearly all students qualify for free lunches, called the program ''dead wrong'' in an e-mail interview, saying children learn ''because they want it, not because they're getting paid.'' 
 Mr. Klein, who grew up in public housing, could recall nothing more in the way of carrots and sticks than an allowance raise or a grounding for one of his bad report cards. His interest in succeeding was quite conventional.
 ''I wanted my parents' approval,'' Mr. Klein said. ''I found education interesting and exciting and I engaged it in those terms. I thought education would create opportunities my family didn't have. My father said if you want to grow up and not live in public housing, pay attention in school.''
 The crucial if amorphous role homes play in whether a child succeeds is why Mr. Johnson thinks the chancellor should come to grips with the limits of what schools can do. 
 Other critics of the new program, like Sol Stern, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, think Mr. Klein should put the incentives into college funds, saying instant cash undermines the idea of learning for its own sake. 
 Another parent, Joan Rose Palacios, whose daughter Olivia is a fourth grader in Queens, wondered: ''What happens when the money dries up? You pull a carrot away, do they stop working?'' But, she added, she is keeping an open mind because she feels that schools in poor neighborhoods need more aid.
 The pilot, devised by Roland G. Fryer, a 30-year-old Harvard economist who has studied racial inequality in schools, is part of a wider program by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration that will offer cash to adults for keeping a job, maintaining health insurance, attending teacher conferences and getting children to show up at school. 
 Laura Rawlings, an economist for the World Bank, which finances $1.2 billion worth of incentive programs in 12 countries like Mexico, says such programs have raised school attendance. 
 The programs can be favorably seen as a form of income maintenance that replaces pure entitlements by requiring parents to commit to behaviors society prefers. But the Mexican program does not reward children for passing tests. And it may be hard to explain to children, sensitive to any unfairness, why one child is getting money while another with better grades is not.

HEADLINE: Restaurateurs-to-Be Look Before Leaping

BYLINE: By TRACIE McMILLAN

 BODY:
PASQUALE VIGGIANO and his wife, Geraldine, thought they knew the restaurant business. Ms. Viggiano had helped her mother run a cafe in Honduras and Mr. Viggiano had grown up hearing his parents' fond tales of the luncheonette they opened when they came to Brooklyn from Italy. 
 ''They described how they put the restaurant together and it kind of excited me,'' Mr. Viggiano said. 
 They had dreamed of opening one of their own since they met more than a decade ago, and last year they started to put plans into place. It would be a Mexican spot in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with a fine wine list, outdoor seating and tableside mariachi singers.
 With the enthusiasm of novices, they figured everything would be ready by the spring. Then they went to Restaurant Management Boot Camp. 
 Sponsored by the city's Department of Small Business Services and Seedco, a national community development group, Boot Camp aims to help small restaurants get off the ground and thrive -- and strengthen the city's economy. Through free monthly seminars at the city's Business Solutions Center, prospective restaurateurs can get help developing business plans, analyzing the market, dealing with health inspections and navigating city bureaucracy. 
 The Viggianos were floored to learn of the regulations and licenses they would be facing. 
 They scrapped the mariachis, which would require a cabaret license. They nixed the idea of formal, matching uniforms, because they would be required to provide laundering services for employees. And they decided to postpone the sidewalk tables, which would require architectural sketches and another license.
 But rather than demoralizing them, Boot Camp seems to have strengthened their dream.
 ''It opened up our eyes to what we were starting to do,'' said Mr. Viggiano, who has a storefront real estate business in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. ''We had to say, let's back off, and make sure we're doing this right.'' 
 They hope to open their restaurant, the Mexican Piramide, this month.
 Restaurants seem to be the most alluring ambition for small entrepreneurs in New York these days. The dining scene is booming in nearly every neighborhood. But according to a study published in the Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly in 2005, 60 percent will close within their first three years. The goal of the Boot Camp, and programs connected to it, is to help give new restaurants a stable, sensible foundation. One way is to make people aware of what they're up against.
 ''Small mom and pops need to know the regulations much better,'' said C. K. Chung, a staff consultant who has met with about 350 hopefuls and helped about a dozen restaurants open since the program began two years ago. ''Boot Camp is a portal for them to know how to run a restaurant business.''
 Jose Luis Hernandez knows the difficulties, having worked in the business since he was a 15-year-old prep cook fresh from Puebla, Mexico, earning $183 for a 48-hour week. But he wants his own place. 
 ''By the time I'm 35, I want to work for myself,'' said Mr. Hernandez, who is now 31. ''It's going to be hard because I have to do a good business plan.''
 In December, Mr. Hernandez left his job as sous-chef at Alfredo of Rome in Midtown to start a restaurant with his life savings of about $100,000. Then his partner pulled out. To buy some time, he joined the kitchen at Morandi in Greenwich Village and moved in with family to save money. 
 In between English classes and shifts as a line cook Mr. Hernandez has been looking for investors and testing his menu on friends and family. He's proudest of his own creations, inspired by his childhood in Puebla: a rib-eye steak in a hibiscus flower sauce, and traditional torta de maiz, a sweet corn cake. 
 He's been working with the Boot Camp and other programs of the restaurant initiative to refine his business plan, work out marketing strategies and find loans.
 The program's expertise has its limits, though.
 ''An owner has to know all the aspects of a restaurant,'' said Bill Guilfoyle, an associate professor in the business management program at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. Programs there and at other culinary schools cover everything from hiring servers to emptying grease traps, and are taught by experienced professionals. New York City's program -- apparently the nation's first public effort to train restaurateurs -- is run instead by small-business experts. ''I'm sure this is helpful, but I don't think that there's any way that anyone who's totally inexperienced in the restaurant industry could really succeed with just this amount of information,'' Mr. Guilfoyle said of the program.
 Or as Gloria Jean Brown, the owner of a cafe in Harlem, said, ''They can't tell me how to run a kitchen, how to bake a pie.'' Still, Ms. Brown is glad she found the Boot Camp.
 A part-time caterer for years, Ms. Brown, and her husband, Tommy, a retired baker, used their savings to convert an abandoned beauty parlor into the T&J Bakery and Cafe, in 2005. While locals loved their sweet potato cheesecake, the Browns had underestimated their expenses, and by late 2006, they were struggling to stay open. Mr. Chung helped them get a $65,000 loan from Seedco's financial arm. 
 Linking one restaurant owner with a loan might be a small victory, but the idea is that every bit counts, Mr. Chung said. 
 ''We provide a threshold of knowledge for them,'' he said. ''When they graduate Boot Camp, they have their own way of starting their business.''

HEADLINE: Islamic Finance and Its Critics

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: GENEVA 

 BODY:
Before the attacks of Sept. 11, Prince Muhammad al-Faisal al-Saud felt welcome in America. A member of the Saudi royal family and a pioneer of Islamic finance, he was a pillar of a Saudi business establishment that has long relished its ties with the United States.
 Since then he has kept his distance. The company he founded in 1981, Dar al-Maal al-Islami Trust -- a Bahamas-incorporated holding company with a portfolio of Islamic banks in Bahrain, Niger, Egypt and Pakistan -- is a defendant in a consolidated $1 trillion lawsuit brought by the families of those who died on Sept. 11, and his lawyers have advised him not to set foot in the United States as the case winds its sluggish way through federal court in Lower Manhattan. 
 Though the prince was originally named in the case, the lawsuits against him were dismissed in 2005. The prince is less well known -- he shuns publicity -- than two of his brothers, Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, and Prince Turki al-Faisal, the former Saudi ambassador to the United States. But as chairman of DMI, he is the public face of the sprawling financial conglomerate, which has been accused of aiding terrorism. More than that, the prince and by extension DMI represent vividly the discordant views that have surrounded Islam and money since Sept. 11.
 Some see him as a founding father of Islamic finance, a thriving piece of the global economy that approaches $800 billion in assets; others view the prince, a follower of the puritanical Wahhabi sect of Islam, as the invisible hand behind a flow of money to Al Qaeda.
 Fueled by soaring oil prices and an increasingly open investment climate, capital is flowing to the Middle East, often steered to institutions like DMI and its subsidiaries, which, to comply with Islamic law, shun interest and speculation in favor of investments in which the borrower and lender share both risk and reward. 
 Yet, in the wake of the attacks on Sept. 11, the tendency to connect the businesses of established Muslim financiers to Islamic extremism continues. That point became clear last year during the outcry over whether DP World, a Dubai-based port operator, should run terminals in the United States. 
 Even now, such suspicions show no sign of abating. Many other Muslim institutions have been named in the suit, and last month Mariane Pearl, the wife of the slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, sued Habib Bank, the largest bank in Pakistan, accusing it of providing banking services to charities that supported terrorist organizations. For the prince, his legal difficulties and a growing resentment of United States policies in the Middle East have put a strain on what traditionally has been a robust business relationship.
 ''There has been a cloud on relations,'' said Richard A. Debs, an advisory director at Morgan Stanley and vice chairman of the United States-Saudi Arabian Business Council. ''There is disaffection -- people think Prince Muhammad has been unfairly persecuted and attacked. I just don't see the connection between Islamic finance and Islamic extremism.''
 In the case of DMI, others are not so sure. This year, the Justice Department's counterterrorism division disclosed that it was investigating whether clients of a DMI subsidiary, via a private equity fund once owned by DMI, avoided paying their share of taxes. 
 In their complaint, lawyers for Sept. 11 relatives argue that the early alliances formed by the prince with conservative political and religious figures in Sudan and Egypt as well as the banking services DMI has provided to people and organizations who would be declared terrorists after Sept. 11 are proof that the prince and the trust have ''conspired with Al Qaeda and the other defendants to carry out terrorist attacks.''
 A lawyer representing DMI, James J. McGuire, denies any such intent. ''The fact that DMI unknowingly had an account with someone who was later deemed a terrorist is hardly evidence that the bank is involved in terrorism,'' Mr. McGuire said.
 To support their case, investigators for the plaintiffs have gathered documents that show that Wael Jelaidan, a suspected founder of Al Qaeda who was designated a terrorist by the United States government in September 2002, maintained an account at Faisal Finance, DMI's Swiss banking unit, from January 1997 to July 2003 that grew to be as large as $405,000. Mr. Jelaidan, through his lawyer, Martin F. McMahon, has denied links to terrorist organizations.
 An even more significant client of Faisal Finance -- now called Faisal Private Bank -- was Yassin Abdullah Kadi, a prominent Saudi businessman and a past shareholder of DMI who was designated a terrorist in October 2001 for his ties to Islamic charities accused of providing financial support to terrorists. Bank records from Faisal Finance show transactions by Mr. Kadi as late as February 2003, more than a year after his designation. Mr. Kadi has denied that he has ever supported terrorist organizations and he is contesting his designation. 
 Other documents collected by plaintiffs show that two extremist groups in Pakistan that have been designated by the United States for their support of terrorism maintained deposit accounts at Faysal Bank Ltd., DMI's banking affiliate there. One is Lashkar-e-tayyiba, an armed group fighting India in the disputed region of Kashmir, and another, Lajnat al-Dawa, is a Kuwait-based foundation that has links to Al Qaeda, according to the United States Treasury's Web site.
 According to Mr. McGuire, DMI's lawyer, the accounts were frozen as soon as the clients had been either put on a designated list or banned in Pakistan. The accounts of Mr. Kadi and Mr. Jelaidan are active only to the extent that investment payouts are recorded and fees are paid to Faisal, he said.
 The complaint also focuses on the ties Prince Muhammad had with religious personalities like Hassan al-Turabi from Sudan, who was a supervisory director of the trust from 1982 to 1992, and Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who was an early religious adviser to the trust until he left in 1994.
 Mr. Turabi was a once-powerful political figure in Sudan who welcomed Osama bin Laden to the country in 1991. Faisal Islamic Bank in Sudan, a past affiliate of the trust, was a major financial sponsor of Mr. Turabi, the complaint contends. And Mr. Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic scholar from Egypt, has been linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did condemn the Sept. 11 attacks.
 Finally, the complaint highlights some fiery language used by Prince Muhammad in a 1984 letter to shareholders in which he says, ''May Allah bless your jihad and all your efforts.''
 Michael E. Elsner, a lawyer representing the Sept. 11 relatives, said that it is the mix of these pieces of evidence that underpins the case. And even if DMI has now cut ties and frozen accounts, he said that having such people on the board and providing financial services to businessmen who would be designated as terrorists are signs of DMI's sympathy toward Islamic extremism. 
 ''All this creates a picture that DMI provided material support to Al Qaeda,'' he said. ''And if the accounts are frozen, why are they accepting investment payouts?''
 But Khalid Abdullah Janahi, the chief executive of DMI since 1998, who has overseen a period of substantial growth for the company as the market for Islamic finance has boomed, sees something more insidious at work: latent prejudice, compounded by a broader bias he has encountered since Sept. 11.
 ''Suddenly the hatred of the petrodollar days is back,'' he said. A gruff, burly man who was a partner at Price Waterhouse before coming to DMI, his voice rises as he explains that jihad can also mean a nonviolent struggle for a pure, legitimate end. He added: ''Rarely in the Western media do I read anything about our food, our culture, our painting or our poetry. I just read how bad we are as Muslims.''
 At DMI's administrative headquarters in a gleaming glass building on the outskirts of Geneva, the only evidence of the trust's Saudi origin is a painting of a pensive King Faisal, the father of Prince Muhammad, which hangs in its main conference room. Mr. Janahi is dressed in a conservative suit and he takes pains to explain that Islamic finance is a global business that has attracted the likes of Goldman Sachs and HSBC to compete with DMI.
 Technically a trust, DMI functions as a holding company, with ownership stakes in Islamic banks in Pakistan, Egypt and Africa, investment banks in Bahrain and the Faisal private bank in Geneva. It also manages $1.5 billion for largely Muslim clients, invested exclusively in businesses and funds that are in tune with Islamic law, like real estate and private equity. 
 Since recording a loss in 2000, its fortunes have soared as capital has flowed to the region and the trust posted a record profit of $52 million last year. 
 Yet the specter of the lawsuit hangs over the company, and it has spent millions of dollars on legal fees. ''We will take this case to the Supreme Court if need be,'' Mr. Janahi said. DMI's motion to dismiss, along with 107 similar motions from other defendants in the case, awaits a decision from Judge George B. Daniels of the Federal District Court in Manhattan. 
 While he will not discuss specific accusations, the idea that an established entrepreneur like the prince -- before DMI, he ran a venture in Jeddah that aimed, unsuccessfully, to bring icebergs to Saudi Arabia -- would knowingly finance terrorism offends Mr. Janahi's pragmatic sensibilities.
 ''These people are all part of the system,'' he said, referring to many well-known Middle Eastern businessmen named in the suit. ''There is no way they are going to pay people to hang themselves.''
 Ibrahim A. Warde, an expert on Islamic finance at the Fletcher School at Tufts University has written a book, out this summer, called ''The Price of Fear.'' In it he contends that contrary to popular perception, there is no monolithic financial pool sustaining Al Qaeda -- a view that is supported by the Sept. 11 Commission's report on terrorism financing. ''There is this idea that it is money that makes terror possible,'' he said. ''So DMI, as an Islamic bank, has a few strikes against it.''

HEADLINE: Bono, Foreign Aid And Skeptics

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Almost nobody has campaigned so energetically for the poor in Africa as Bono, but when Bono spoke at a conference in Africa recently, he was heckled. Several Africans scolded him for demanding more foreign aid, saying that's not what Africa needs.
 A handful of recent books and studies suggest that aid is sometimes oversold, including the superb new work called ''The Bottom Billion,'' by Paul Collier, the World Bank's former research economist (it's the best nonfiction book so far this year). A forthcoming book, ''Farewell to Alms,'' by Gregory Clark, a University of California economist, even argues that conventional aid can leave African countries worse off than ever. 
 And a study by two economists formerly of the I.M.F., Raghuram Rajan and Arvind Subramanian, forthcoming in The Review of Economics and Statistics, concludes:
 ''We find little robust evidence of a positive (or negative) relationship between aid inflows into a country and its economic growth. We also find no evidence that aid works better in better policy or geographical environments, or that certain forms of aid work better than others. Our findings suggest that for aid to be effective in the future, the aid apparatus will have to be rethought.''
 So does this mean we should give up on foreign aid?
 No, not at all. On the contrary, I believe there is an urgent need for more aid. But this is an important discussion worth having, and the critics (though a minority of the experts) make some fair points. Plus, there's no doubt that aid can be made more effective.
 Just to place this issue in context, consider a family I visited in a malarial jungle in Cambodia. The mother had just died of malaria, so the grandmother was left looking after five children -- but she had only one mosquito net that could accommodate three children. So every night the grandmother had to decide which three children to put under the bed net and which to expose to malaria.
 I left the grandmother money to buy another net. And since any of us would do the same to a woman in front of us, why shouldn't we donate a net through a group like www.MalariaNoMore.org?
 Critics of aid worry that aid can jack up a poor country's exchange rate and thus undermine local businesses. That's a legitimate concern, but private aid flows are typically too modest to have an impact. 
 Another concern is that when aid groups move into a country, they grab all resources -- sometimes turning scarce doctors into managers of aid bureaucracies. That's also a genuine problem.
 But this is the 30th anniversary of the eradication of smallpox, and it's worth considering that foreign aid project.
 The U.S. invested $32 million over 10 years in the global battle against smallpox. That sum is recouped every two months, simply because Americans no longer need to get vaccinated against smallpox. So that investment has yielded a 46 percent annual return since smallpox was eradicated. 
 In addition, an estimated 1.5 million people used to die annually of smallpox. So eradication has saved around 45 million lives over the last three decades.
 Smallpox was a great success but not a fluke. Among other historical foreign aid successes are immunizations, oral rehydration therapy and the green revolution.
 More broadly, when we pay a few hundred dollars for fistula surgery so that a teenage girl no longer will leak urine or feces for the rest of her life, that operation may not stimulate economic growth. But no one who sees such a girl's happiness after surgery can doubt that such aid is effective, for it truly saves a human being. 
 Look, it's true that aid doesn't always work -- any more than other projects do. We spend billions on our military, yet it doesn't always succeed. But the lesson should be to deploy military power more wisely, not to give up on it. 
 So how do we make aid smarter? Health and education spending has a pretty good record. Some interventions, like school feedings run by the World Food Program, address both areas: For just 10 cents a day, a child gets a lunch that reduces malnutrition and improves attendance.
 And we should commit more aid to nurturing manufacturing and business development, so that countries can grow on their own.
 One great U.S. program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or A.G.O.A., does that and should be expanded. Another excellent U.S. aid program, the Millennium Challenge Account, nudges countries toward better governance -- yet a stingy and myopic Congress is balking at funding it. 
 So let's accept that getting foreign aid right is harder than it looks -- but also remember that 4,110 people didn't die today from smallpox. Aid can be cause for celebration, not embarrassment.

HEADLINE: Doctors' Income (1 Letter)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your assertion that reducing physician income will significantly reduce health care costs doesn't acknowledge that physician income only accounts for 5 to 10 percent of total health care spending (''Sending Back the Doctors Bill,'' Week in Review, July 29). 
 The American Medical Association agrees that strategies are needed to contain health care costs and achieve greater value for health spending. Health care spending has yielded substantial clinical, economic and quality-of-life benefits, but the overall growth in health care costs has outpaced general inflation. 
 While physicians play a key role in efforts to contain costs, problems like obesity, tobacco use, alcohol, substance abuse and violence will require action by stakeholders from inside and outside the health care system to drive major societal change.
 With a predicted shortage of 85,000 physicians by 2020 and an aging population, we need to attract the best and brightest students to medicine. We must fix the flaws in our health care system, including ensuring that all Americans have health care coverage, reforming the broken medical liability system and stopping Medicare cuts to doctors that make it hard to care for seniors.

HEADLINE: Bush Faults Easy Money For Volatility

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush, seeking to reassure Americans about the economy and combat Democratic criticism of his policies, said on Wednesday that recent financial market turbulence was not a cause for worry but a natural adjustment from the improvident lending of recent years.
 Speaking at the Treasury Department, with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. sitting across the table and reporters seated in a circle around them, Mr. Bush said that his economic advisers would be ''paying close attention as the market begins to readjust its assessment of risk'' in housing and other sectors.
 The president said he also discussed with Mr. Paulson and other cabinet members the possibility of tax cuts and reduced regulations aimed at overcoming what some see as a weakening of the competitiveness of American capital markets compared with those overseas. But he was cautious about saying what he might propose.
 ''We worked through possible suggestions for Congress to think about,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It may be an issue that requires a lot of selling to get the conditions right for people to even take it seriously.'' 
 It was an unusual presentation for Mr. Bush, both politically and economically. Presidents are usually advised not to wade into discussions of markets at a time when they are so unpredictable and anxiety-inducing.
 Mr. Bush's suggestion that the recent housing declines should be seen as a normal market correction from past excesses and that the government should avoid interfering with the process carries political risks at a time when some people are losing their homes, lending institutions are shaky and Democrats are demanding action. 
 Indeed, immediately after the president's comments, Democrats excoriated him for saying that the economy was in sound shape, and many called on the administration to encourage federal housing agencies to step in and make more money available, perhaps by buying up troubled mortgages to avoid foreclosures.
 For his part, Mr. Bush, in a verbal tour of the current economic scene, was eager both to calm the markets and knock down the Democratic calls for the administration to intervene, predicting that the turmoil in the housing sector would end with a ''soft landing'' and would not damage the larger economy.
 ''I believe that markets ultimately look at the fundamentals of any economy,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Inflation is down. Real wages are increasing. The job market is a strong job market. People are working. Small businesses are flourishing.''
 Mr. Bush, who has a master's degree in business administration from Harvard, confidently used phrases like liquidity, risk assessment and market adjustment to describe complex economic conditions.
 Asked about collapsing housing markets, and the risk of them declining further, Mr. Bush said: ''In a way it's a necessary reaction to a flood of liquidity that came into the market in the past couple years.'' That was financial jargon referring to the past several years of easy money, some of it from overseas, at low interest rates.
 Mr. Bush said that as a result of the deep pools of money available, ''housing got really hot'' and that a decline was inevitable. He added that ''if the market functions normally'' it will lead to a soft landing. ''That's kind of what it looks like so far,'' he contended.
 Democrats are reacting to the current situation less philosophically. Several are calling for the two big government-sponsored buyers of mortgages from lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to provide more money for housing by buying more loans and holding them.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York who is chairman of the housing subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, said that if these agencies did not act, it would lead to a collapse of the market for sound mortgages, not just the deeply troubled subprime loans that were sold to new homebuyers and people with less-than-sterling credit.
 ''We need to allow Fannie and Freddie to put more credit into prime lending,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''This is favored by most Democrats and a good number of Republicans.''
 But Mr. Bush appeared to resist that idea, saying that the agencies needed to overhaul their own practices after experiencing accounting scandals before jumping into the current crisis. ''Let's get them reformed first,'' he said.
 He said the housing crisis occurred in part because borrowers had not read the ''fine print'' on their mortgages. ''There needs to be financial education measures in place,'' he said.
 The president's session with economic writers was unscheduled until Wednesday morning, when he was at the Treasury building for an annual meeting with his economic team. Their intent was to plan for issues like the budget, taxes and financial regulation coming up in the fall.
 After that meeting, Mr. Bush sounded several familiar themes, accusing Democrats of wanting to raise taxes and embark on wasteful spending. He said he would veto legislation to expand the children's health insurance program, charging that it would raise taxes and ''nationalize'' the health sector, and reiterated his threat to veto other spending bills that went over his budget request.
 The statement appeared to signal the White House's plan to go on the offensive in the fall to counter criticism and widespread economic anxiety by confronting Democrats on time-tested Republican themes like keeping taxes low and spending under control.
 ''I understand there's disquiet out there,'' Mr. Bush said. ''By the way, do you think they feel disquiet now? Go ahead and run up their taxes and see how they feel.''
 Mr. Bush also said he would oppose legislation aimed at punishing China for its economic practices, including its efforts to control the value of its currency to encourage cheaper exports. Expressing the need for the United States to lead the global economy, he called on Democrats to approve recently negotiated trade deals with Peru, Panama, Colombia and Korea.
 The Peru and Panama deals appeared to be on track for passage this year, but Democrats backed off in June. Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview that he now expected the Peru deal to proceed in September.
 Mr. Rangel was in Peru this week and said that Peruvian leaders had committed themselves to several steps to protect worker rights, reassuring him on that subject. ''The Peruvians,'' he said, ''will be doing everything that has to be done for this to be passed.''
 Besides trade, Mr. Bush spoke at length about the failure of his immigration legislation this year, saying that he had predicted ''there would be blowback'' from growers who could not get immigrant workers to help pick produce. What was needed, he said, was a guest-worker program for these workers.

HEADLINE: Automakers, Affected by $3 Gas and Housing Downturn, Predict a Weak Year

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and NICK BUNKLEY. 
Micheline Maynard reported from Detroit and Nick Bunkley from Acme, Mich.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Major automakers are openly acknowledging what the rest of the country already knew: a soft housing market and high gasoline prices are damping sales of cars and light trucks.
 On Wednesday, General Motors lowered its forecast for 2007 auto sales, joining the Ford Motor Company, which lowered its forecast on Tuesday. The Toyota Motor Company, which ranks second behind G.M. in the American market, is also predicting a sales decline for the year, even though Toyota's sales are actually up.
 All told, the companies are predicting sales of 16.3 million to 16.7 million vehicles this year. Automakers sold 16.55 million vehicles in 2006, and sales this year are down 3.7 percent, according to Autodata, a firm that tracks industry statistics. If industry sales end up below last year's, they would be the lowest since 1998. 
 And even the most pessimistic prediction may be too rosy, said Ron Pinelli, Autodata's president. Autodata is predicting sales of 16.2 million vehicles this year, more than one million vehicles below the industry record, set seven years ago. 
 Back then, Mr. Pinelli said, auto sales were riding the crest of the sport utility wave, fueled by booming technology companies whose success spilled over into auto sales. ''Everything was dot-com,'' Mr. Pinelli said. ''Everyone was convinced they were going to get rich. You had this party going on in the country, and it pushed sales up to 17.4 million in 2000.'' 
 But Detroit automakers have been hit hard this year by a variety of economic problems, including the housing slowdown, which in turn has hurt sales of profitable big pickup trucks. Gasoline prices remain near $3 a gallon in much of the country, and unemployment is widespread in Michigan and parts of the Midwest, their primary markets.
 Consumers ''really have'' changed their behavior as gas prices have climbed, Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said at an industry conference in Acme, Mich., near Traverse City. ''They've moved away from the bigger S.U.V.'s and the trucks and they've moved into smaller cars.'' 
 He added: ''There are a lot of things with 2007. We're really watching the economic development but also the housing market and the tightening credit, because that could affect even more.''
 On Tuesday, Ford said industry sales could range as low as 16.5 million, down from a previous forecast of 16.8 million. Its auto sales are down 13 percent this year compared with 2006.
 G.M., in a conference call with investors, said it expected auto sales to range from 16.5 million to 16.6 million vehicles, down about 100,000 from its previous forecast. G.M.'s sales are down 9.9 percent from 2006.
 ''We have an industry that is clearly underperforming normal levels,'' said G.M.'s chief sales analyst, Paul Ballew. 
 Both G.M. and Ford have voluntarily cut back on unprofitable sales to big fleet customers, like rental car companies. The automakers did not announce production cuts, the next likely step. Mr. Mulally said Ford would make that determination after Labor Day. 
 But James Lentz, an executive vice president with Toyota, said auto companies would still have ''a very decent year'' even if sales declined over all. Toyota's sales are up 5.5 percent, thanks in part to the new version of its Tundra pickup, which has bucked the trend of lower truck sales.
 Toyota also has benefited from its reputation for building fuel-efficient vehicles, like the hybrid-electric Prius. It was the 12th-best-selling vehicle in the country last month, when auto sales for Detroit companies fell nearly 10 percent, and import carmakers passed G.M., Ford and Chrysler for the first time to take a majority of American auto sales.
 In recent months, Detroit companies have dropped their long-standing opposition to an increase in fuel economy standards, although they are fighting a bill passed by the Senate that would require them to increase vehicles' efficiency by 40 percent through 2020.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Mulally suggested that a tax of 50 cents a gallon might be more effective in persuading consumers to use less fuel. Representative John D. Dingell, a Democrat of Michigan who has long been the industry's advocate in Washington, has begun floating that plan, which some critics doubt will find support.
 Mr. Mulally said: ''If we're really going to work on this, the way we need get at it is to make it an economic decision just like they do in Europe, where prices are seven, eight, nine dollars a gallon'' partly because of higher taxes. ''Our behavior would change dramatically,'' he said.
 Though he did not endorse Mr. Dingell's plan, Mr. Mulally said: ''I just think it's so important that we all join in this debate and we really decide what we want to do about energy security and global warming. A piece of that could be a tax.''

HEADLINE: Utah Coal Area, a Region Apart, Knows Well the Perils of Mining

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Martin Stolz contributed reporting from Huntington, and Dan Frosch from Denver.

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON, Utah, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Coal is probably not the first thing that comes to mind when people think about Utah, and there is good reason for that.
 Through a fluke of geology and deep time, much of Utah's coal was concentrated in one spot, here in the red rock country of the state's high east-central plateau, where bituminous coal is king. And the same forces then pushed it down fiercely into the earth. Some of the deepest coal mines in the nation are here, including one just down the road where miners are pushing toward 3,000 feet beneath the surface.
 The coal, in turn, shaped the region's ethnicity, culture and politics. Greeks and Italians arrived to work as miners in the early 20th century and stayed on to build a distinctive rural enclave among the Mormon farmers. Later, the political jousting of mine owners and workers forged a tradition of voting for Democrats in an overwhelmingly Republican part of the nation. 
 It is at moments like this, people here say, that the culture of the Utah mine country comes out in full flower. By any measure, they say, the six men who were trapped early Monday when part of the Crandall Canyon Mine here in Huntington spectacularly collapsed were more than just local working men who got unlucky. 
 Tap a resident in the small towns of Utah's coal belt and any one of the six could have been a brother, a husband or a friend. If one family does not have any miners at the dinner table, its neighbors will. Pulling together, especially when something bad occurs and every ear is tuned to news from the mine, has been a part of making a living here for so long that people say it comes without conscious thought. 
 ''It's what we do,'' said Julie Jones, who lives in Huntington sandwiched by generations of miners. Her husband mined coal, and his father before him. Ms. Jones's son, Elam, 23, is a miner at Crandall Canyon and has been working on the rescue, sometimes helping clear a tunnel into the collapsed area with his bare hands, his mother said. 
 ''If we worried about this stuff, we'd all have to take Xanax,'' Ms. Jones said.
 Economic cycles of the coal business, as with any industry, have shaped the working life. Coal's first wave, beginning in the late 1800s, for example, was linked to the railroads. Coal for steel came later, and the steel companies in turn brought the labor unions. That era ended in the 1970s. Coal for electricity -- mostly extracted by nonunion workers in larger and deeper mines -- has marked coal's latest boom.
 The number of coal field workers, who earn upward of $100,000 a year including benefits, has risen by about a third since 2002, to about 2,000, according to figures from the Utah State Geological Survey. 
 The expanding work force has attracted many Mexicans. Of the six men trapped at Crandall Canyon, three are described by the mine company as Hispanic, though no names have been released.
 The night shift miners were working at 1,500 feet below the mountain when the collapse occurred just after 2:45 a.m. Monday. No communication has been possible, and mine officials say they have no idea if the men are alive.
 ''It's a matter of the market,'' said Dave Tabet, the energy and minerals program manager at the Utah Geological Survey. ''As prices go up, as they have recently, they can afford to go deeper.''
 The coal counties here have always been different. Politically and culturally, Emery and Carbon Counties are more aligned with western Colorado than with the rest of Utah, said Randy Simmons, a political science professor at Utah State University. 
 Carbon County, especially, is considered an anomaly, Professor Simmons said, because of its influx of Greek and Italian immigrants and because it has a lower percentage of Mormons compared with the rest of rural Utah. 
 ''If you want to see blond people, you come to Utah, but that's not the case in Carbon County,'' Professor Simmons said. ''Culturally, it's not part of mainstream Utah. There's a lot more religious diversity.'' 
 But the life underground is what shapes the real difference, many people here say. It is a culture where stoicism, fatalism and wrenching empathy of shared values can combine, sometimes even in the same sentence.
 ''We're accustomed to these activities and these accidents -- we'll rebuild,'' said Laine Adair, the general manager of a subsidiary of the Murray Energy Corporation, a co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine.
 Mr. Adair described the painstakingly slow progress taking place on Wednesday, as rescue workers inched forward, reinforcing walls with steel pillars every two and a half feet to stave off further collapses.
 ''We just have to put our emotions aside, and we can get to them,'' he said, his eyes filling with tears as he spoke.

HEADLINE: Fewer Mexican Immigrants Are Sending Money Back Home, Bank Says

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
This year a smaller percentage of Mexican immigrants in the United States sent money back to their homeland than in 2006, according to a report released yesterday by the Inter-American Development Bank. The bank said the reduction had left at least two million people in Mexico without the same financial help they had once received. 
 Bank officials, pointing to a survey of Mexican immigrants in the report, said the decline reflected a rising sense of insecurity and uncertainty about whether they would stay in the United States. Anticipating a possible move back to Mexico, these immigrants appear to be saving more. 
 ''They have decided because of the uncertainty of the future that they need to step back and save a bit,'' said Donald F. Terry, general manager of the Multilateral Investment Fund at the bank. 
 Mr. Terry said the slowdown would affect about 500,000 Mexican homes. ''For those families in Mexico, there is going to be economic and social dislocation,'' he said. 
 Over all, the percentage of Mexicans who regularly sent money home fell to 64 percent in the first half of this year, compared with 71 percent for all of last year, according to the report. The sharpest decline in such transactions -- known as remittances -- came among Mexicans living in states where they have settled in large numbers only recently, like Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. In those states, the percentage of Mexicans sending money home fell to 56 percent from January to June, from 80 percent in 2006.
 In the survey, only 49 percent of the Mexicans living in states with relatively recent immigration said they expected to be living in the United States five years from now. Sergio Bendixen, a Miami pollster who conducted the survey, said the percentage of Mexicans considering a return to their country was the highest in the more than two decades he has interviewed Hispanic immigrants. 
 The immigrants in the survey included American citizens and legal and illegal residents. They identified discrimination as the biggest problem they faced, with 83 percent saying that discrimination against Latin American immigrants in general was growing in the United States.
 ''Mexican immigrants don't feel welcome in the U.S. anymore,'' Mr. Bendixen said. ''They feel they are not wanted here, and their contributions are not appreciated.'' 
 Until this year, money sent home by Mexicans working in the United States had shown spectacular annual growth since 2000, the first year it was systematically recorded by Mexico's central bank. Last year, these funds totaled $23 billion, making them the country's second-largest source of foreign income after oil. 
 But in the first half of 2007, there was no significant increase over the $11.4 billion sent to Mexico in the first half of 2006, a period that recorded a 23 percent increase over the same months in 2005. 
 By contrast, the amount of money sent home by immigrants from Central America has continued to grow, according to the development bank. 
 Remittances to Mexico have become vital to the economics of the country's poorest regions, bank officials said. The money pays for drinking-water systems, roads, care for older people and other needs in villages and working-class neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: 12th Graders Show Better Grasp of Market Forces Than Expected on U.S. Economics Test

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
The nation's high school seniors performed significantly better on the first nationwide economics test than they did on other recent national exams in history and science, and demonstrated higher than expected understanding of basic market forces like supply and demand than officials expected.
 Results of the economics test, which was administered last year, were released yesterday. A summary report is available online at nationsreportcard.gov. 
 The Department of Education translates student scores on the test, known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, into three achievement levels: advanced, proficient and basic. 
 On the economics test, 42 percent of 12th graders performed at or above the proficient level, and 79 percent performed at or above the basic level. An economics course is required for graduation in only about a third of the states.
 ''The numbers here are pretty good, really,'' said Darvin M. Winick, chairman of the bipartisan body set up by Congress to oversee the test. ''Given the number of students who finish high school with a limited vocabulary, not reading well and weak in math, the results may be as good or better than we should expect.''
 In contrast, only 13 percent of 12th graders performed at or above proficient, and only 47 percent performed at or above the basic level on the national assessment test in history that was administered last year. On a similar test in science in 2005, only 18 percent of 12th graders performed at or above the proficient level, and 54 percent at or above basic.
 Bruce L. Damasio, a high school economics teacher in Towson, Md., who is president of the Global Association of Teachers of Economics, said the economics results showed that ''many of our 12th-grade students have a pretty good grasp of the logic of economics.''
 ''But when we look at the questions they can answer and the ones most of them get wrong,'' Mr. Damasio said, ''we see that many students are pretty shaky on the terminology of economics and on the actual ways that government and financial systems work.'' 
 Mr. Damasio cited a question that asked students to identify the most likely effect of an increase in the hourly wage of baby sitters. Eighty percent of students answered correctly that the time spent by teenagers on baby sitting would likely go up, whereas time they spent on other activities would decrease, he said.
 But on a multiple-choice question that asked students to identify one of the policy tools of the Federal Reserve, only 21 percent chose the correct answer, ''buying and selling government securities.'' Thirty-seven percent incorrectly chose ''increasing or decreasing government spending,'' and 31 percent chose ''raising or lowering income taxes,'' he said. 
 ''This means that students haven't learned that Congress and the president determine federal spending,'' Mr. Damasio said.
 The Department of Education periodically administers the nationwide tests in reading, mathematics, science, history, civics, geography and the arts. But although the federal testing program began in 1969, no national assessment had been conducted in economics until 2006.
 A nationally representative sample of 11,500 seniors in 590 public and private schools took part in the exam.
 The test questionnaire asked students to list any economics courses they had taken in high school. Although a minority of states require economics, 87 percent of seniors reported some exposure to economics content in high school.
 But the effect of that exposure was surprising. The scores of students who had taken economics courses were not necessarily higher than those who had not. On average, students who had taken Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate or an honors course in economics scored marginally higher than students who had taken no economics at all, but students who had taken ''consumer economics'' or business courses scored lower.

HEADLINE: As Off Broadway Changes, Some Venerable Theaters Vanish

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
The recent closing of the Actors' Playhouse, a 62-year-old stalwart of Off Broadway in Greenwich Village, was hardly startling for people who keep up with theater news. The announcement that another Off Broadway theater is closing has become almost routine over the past few years. 
 The former Promenade Theater is becoming a perfume and cosmetics boutique. The Century Center for the Performing Arts will serve as a studio for the Christian-oriented Trinity Broadcasting Network. The Lambs Theater is to be a hotel. Others have become condominiums. 
 A reasonable assumption might be that the closing of all these theaters -- six in the last two years alone -- is ushering in the decline of commercial Off Broadway. 
 But it turns out the situation is more complicated than that.
 A lack of theaters can hardly be blamed as the source of Off Broadway's undisputed woes, since there are, in fact, quite a few more commercial Off Broadway theaters than there were a decade ago, according to data compiled by the Off Broadway Brainstormers, an industry group formed last year. 
 New World Stages, the $23 million complex on 50th Street that opened in 2004, introduced five new theaters to Off Broadway; 37 Arts, a complex in far west Midtown which opened in 2005, brought in three; the Snapple Theater Center, which opened in 2005, has two. With these and other recent entries, there are currently at least 31 Off Broadway theaters that are not controlled by nonprofit companies, the data shows. In 1997 there were about 22. (It's approximate because some theaters that are used predominantly by nonprofit companies can become commercial spaces for certain productions.)
 That adds up to 4,000 more seats on commercial Off Broadway than there were a decade ago, an increase of nearly 80 percent.
 Many of the new theaters, which tend to be larger than the older ones, were built in the middle 1990s, when Broadway was in the doldrums and shows were lined up for Off Broadway theaters. But some theater operators say the supply of all the new theaters may have outstripped the demand, which has dwindled as Broadway has bounced back in recent years. 
 They maintain that a surplus of theaters -- in addition to the real estate pressures, the congested and expensive advertising market and the economic downturn after 9/11 -- led to the recent spate of closings and the difficulties of theaters that are still open.
 ''I don't think our audience has actually shrunk,'' said Beverley D. Mac Keen, the executive director of New World Stages and founder of Off Broadway Brainstormers. ''Year over year over year, I think the audience has remained static, if not grown. But you'll find it's diluted.''
 ''There are more commercial theaters,'' she said, ''and therefore you can't expect to fill up your well because you've built another one.''
 Ms. Mac Keen said that Off Broadway is just going through a correction right now, and that, with strong partnerships between producers and theater operators, it will right itself eventually. 
 Others are less sanguine. Ben Sprecher, who runs the Little Shubert theater Off Broadway and once ran the Promenade and the Variety Arts, both of which have closed in recent years, said there simply weren't enough viable productions Off Broadway anymore, and for various economic and cultural reasons he wasn't optimistic that would change.
 He said, his decision to close the Promenade, once the home of ''Three Tall Women'' and ''Hurlyburly,'' was not made under real estate pressure; as a part owner of the lease for the space, he accepted a lucrative offer to open the space for a business (namely a Sephora boutique). Given the direction that Off Broadway was headed, as well as his own plans to be a producer, he said, it was a logical decision.
 ''The lineups kept getting smaller, with stranger projects,'' Mr. Sprecher said. ''I looked around and said, 'This is not what it once was.' ''
 David Brouillard, an associate manager who also books shows at the Zipper Factory on 37th Street, said the old model of Off Broadway producing simply wasn't working anymore. Until recently the Zipper, which opened in 2001, was another Off Broadway house putting on shows with open-ended runs. But in April, after a production of a William Finn revue fell through due to a lack of funding, the Zipper reintroduced itself as a place with more flexible scheduling, presenting very short engagements that could extend depending on demand.
 ''They just can't afford to stay open,'' Mr. Brouillard said of the open-ended runs the Zipper used to present.
 In New York no problem is ever far removed from real estate costs. While there are plenty of new commercial Off Broadway theaters, many of them have their own heavy rents to pay. And in bigger houses, they have a burden to put on bigger shows, with bigger budgets.
 As a result the odds against financial success Off Broadway have become greater and greater, said Eric Krebs, a producer and the former manager of the John Houseman and Douglas Fairbanks theaters, both of which closed in 2005 and were later demolished.
 ''The new theaters are so expensive, both for the operators and producers, that it demands a certain size of capitalization to do anything and demands a certain entertainment orientation,'' he said.
 Mr. Krebs's show, ''The All-American Sport of Bipartisan Bashing'' at New World Stages, is sharing its theater with ''My First Time,'' a show about initial sexual experiences, to save on costs. 
 Though Mr. Krebs described ''Bipartisan Bashing'' as thought-provoking theater, he did acknowledge that Off Broadway is becoming somewhat segregated; the nonprofit theaters are putting on the serious work while the commercial theater operators and producers, out of necessity, are tending to look for hits with broad appeal. 
 The list of financially successful productions in the last decade -- ''Stomp,'' ''Jewtopia,'' ''Blue Man Group'' -- attests to the latter strategy. Because several of the new theaters have been built in Midtown in the hopes of picking up Broadway spillover traffic, the lines between shows on and off Broadway have become blurred. 
 Others say the recent closings will have a more lasting effect than a mere shift in the market. Scott Morfee, who operates the Barrow Street Theater and manages to keep it open while putting on critically successful productions, is optimistic about the theater scene itself, pointing out a wealth of talented writers and rising number of sold-out performances at the Barrow Street.
 But it's the loss of the theaters themselves, he said, particularly the smaller ones, which were the anchors of neighborhoods before being forced out by real estate pressures, that is threatening the cultural landscape.
 ''This is just terrible news for New York, what's going on,'' he said, comparing the loss of these theaters with the loss of institutions like the old Pennsylvania Station. ''New York is pricing itself out of this market. We do not have a Plan B. My Plan B might be to go to another city. And believe me, I've thought about it.''

Here are some of the commercial Off Broadway theaters that have closed recently and what New York has gotten -- or will be getting -- in their places.

HEADLINE: Sales Outpace Inventories At Wholesalers

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Sales at United States wholesalers rose faster than inventories in June, increasing the chances that companies will order more from factories and help offset the housing recession.
 Stockpiles gained a greater-than-forecast 0.5 percent, matching the increase in May, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Sales climbed 0.6 percent after a 1.3 percent increase the previous month. 
 Businesses had goods on hand to last little more than a month at the current sales pace, matching the record low. The need to replenish inventories will keep orders growing, assembly lines running and the economy expanding at the moderate pace predicted by the Federal Reserve.
 ''The inventory picture is a positive in the near term,'' said John Shin, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. Increasing stocks will probably contribute a quarter of a percentage point to the economic expansion in the second half of the year, he estimates.
 Wholesalers account for about a quarter of all business inventories.
 The value of wholesale inventories rose to $398.5 billion in June, from $396.6 billion in May. Factory inventories rose 0.3 percent in June, after increasing 0.4 percent a month earlier, the Commerce Department said on Aug. 2. Retail inventories will be included in the business stockpiles report to be released Monday.
 The increase in sales in June was the smallest since a drop in purchases in January. Still, most analysts estimate inventories are still too lean relative to demand, suggesting the rebuilding of stocks will remain a positive force for growth.
 Computer and hardware distributors showed the biggest gains in sales relative to inventories. Stockpiles of computer equipment rose 1.1 percent as sales increased 5.4 percent. Hardware inventories rose 0.3 percent while sales were up 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Shares Ride Late-Day Roller Coaster to an Upswing

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks surged yesterday as solid results in the technology arena and renewed demand for risky debt soothed investors a day after the Federal Reserve said the economy should keep expanding. 
 A late-day plunge and recovery, however, revealed investors' persistent unease.
 The Dow Jones industrial average initially surged more than 190 points, then dropped into negative territory in the last hour of trading, reportedly on speculation that Goldman Sachs would release some negative news. When Goldman Sachs dispelled the rumor, the Dow rebounded to finish up more than 150 points.
 The sell-off illustrated how quickly sentiment can turn. The market has been ricocheting up and down recently on worries that borrowing will become tougher because of losses in the subprime mortgage market.
 Wall Street was pleased to hear, though, that the computer network equipment maker Cisco Systems posted a 25 percent jump in quarterly profit Tuesday and raised its revenue forecast for the year. Cisco rose $1.99, or 6.7 percent, to $31.68.
 The Dow rose 153.56 points, or 1.14 percent, to 13,657.86. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.78 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,497.49. The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index added 51.38 points, or 2.01 percent, to 2,612.98.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 21.53, or 2.78 percent, to 795.66.
 The Fed's suggestion that it was not too worried about the credit markets appeared to reinvigorate them: risky, high-yielding corporate bonds rose, while safe, low-yielding government bonds fell.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.88 percent from 4.77 percent on Tuesday. The price fell 26/32, to 97 3/32. 
 The financial and home building sectors -- big losers in recent weeks --had large gains yesterday, with many investors seeing value in these pummeled stocks.
 Bear Stearns, whose collapsing hedge funds have been a prime cause of market jitters, rose 3.6 percent, to $121.12. Lehman Brothers rose 6.7 percent, to $64.78; JPMorgan Chase rose 2.6 percent, to $46.51; and American Express rose 4.2 percent, to $62.96.
 The home builder KB Home rose 8.8 percent, to $35.97, after saying late Tuesday it used cash on hand to repay $650 million in debt to rid its balance sheet of obligations. D. R. Horton rose 6.9 percent, to $18.59. Centex rose 8.2 percent, to $38.58. 
 Crude oil prices fell 27 cents, to $72.15 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about eight to three on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to a heavy 5.30 billion shares, up from 4.71 billion shares on Tuesday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Toll Brothers Reports Sales Decline; Trade Group Lowers Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
The luxury home builder Toll Brothers reported a 21 percent decline in preliminary home building revenue for the third quarter and said the housing market was so volatile that it would not give earnings guidance. 
 Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors, a trade group for real estate agents, lowered its outlook for existing-home sales this year by 1 percent, or 70,000 homes. 
 Robert I. Toll, Toll Brothers' usually ebullient chief executive, remained cautious. ''With the uncertainties roiling the mortgage markets right now, the pace of home sales could slow further until the credit markets settle down,'' he said.
 Analysts said that Toll Brothers, which has a mortgage-lending business, had not been as directly affected by the problems of subprime borrowers, but they added that it did have greater exposure to buyers with jumbo loans and those stretching to qualify for loans larger than their incomes might justify.
 Its sales nonetheless beat analysts' expectations, and the stock rose $1.38, or 6 percent, to $24.33. 
 Toll, the nation's largest building of luxury homes, said it expected to report revenue of $1.21 billion for the quarter that ended July 31, down from $1.5 billion for the same quarter last year, when it releases earnings on Aug. 22.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial on average were expecting revenue of $1.08 billion.
 ''Things could have been worse,'' said Gregory E. Gieber, an analyst with A. G. Edwards. ''Orders have fallen back to where they were before the boom.''
 Toll Brothers, based in Horsham, Pa., said it was taking pretax write-downs of $125 million to $175 million in the quarter on homes it could not sell for a profit, as well as on land options that the company was abandoning.
 In the third quarter, Toll Brothers said revenue in its Western region was hit the hardest, down 24 percent, to $321.7 million. The North was down 22 percent, to $293.4 million. Close behind was the Middle Atlantic, down 21.6 percent, to $350.7 million. The South fell 14 percent, to $242.2 million.
 The association's revised forecast calls for existing-home sales of 6.04 million in 2007, down from July's prediction of 6.11 million for the year. 
 The group said it expected median existing-home prices nationwide to fall 1.2 percent, to a median of $219,300 this year before climbing back next year to $223,600.
 ''With the population growing, the demand for homes isn't going away, it's just being delayed,'' Lawrence Yun, the group's senior economist, said. ''More buyers and cutbacks in new construction will eventually draw down the inventory levels and support future price appreciation, but general gains will be modest next year. Serious buyers today have a long-term view of housing as an investment -- speculators have left the market.''

HEADLINE: When High Price Is the Allure

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
WHEN readers leaf through the September issue of Vogue, which arrives on newsstands next week, they will encounter a Prada mohair twin set tagged at $2,925; a chunky Giles sweater, at $3,675; and a supersize Marc Jacobs bracelet, at $2,180. And as fall looks begin trickling into stores this month, shoppers will find basic designer sheath dresses selling for $1,200, coats for just under $4,000 and designer sunglasses for $500 or more. 
 This is the fourth consecutive autumn season in which a weak dollar has meant higher prices for designer clothing, much of which is made in Europe or stitched from fabrics imported from European mills. As the value of the dollar shrinks against the euro, prices continue to climb, with retailers citing hikes of as much as 15 percent for shoes and bags this year compared with last.
 Yet, merchants and manufacturers have seen surprisingly little resistance in recent seasons to the cost of luxury goods. 
 So strong is the demand for cashmere car coats and crinkled patent leather bags at Barneys New York that that two firms -- one from Dubai, the other from Japan -- are in a bidding war this month to acquire the store for close to $1 billion. The luxury conglomerate LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, had net profits for the first half of 2007 of $1.11 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago. Profits at the parent of Gucci and at Prada are also up. 
 Those brands owe part of their success to shoppers with caviar taste who have come to view extravagant prices as an enduring, if unwelcome, fact of life. At the same time, another consumer cohort is driving the trend, shoppers for whom a high ticket can in itself be an inducement to buy. Just as makers of premium ice cream have persuaded consumers to pay $4 for a cone instead of 90 cents, and California vintners convince them that a $100 cabernet is better than a $50 bottle, the makers of designer clothing know that high prices can cast a spell. 
 ''Price certainly plays into a product's allure,'' said Robert Burke, a retail consultant in New York. ''For certain people, the higher the price, the more attractive the item becomes.'' 
 An exorbitant price can confer exclusivity. ''People are willing to pay a significant amount of money to make sure they don't see their purchase on other people,'' Mr. Burke said. 
 Or to ensure that their friends will recognize its provenance. ''Price is part of the status of certain luxury items,'' said Marvin Traub, a retail consultant in New York. Mr. Traub, who visited Moscow in March, noticed that people there were fascinated not by how little but how much was paid. To some extent, Mr. Traub noted, ''that sort of thinking translates here, too.''
 Among merchants and manufacturers, consumer psychology can be as significant as economics in setting prices. ''Luxury makers are not necessarily forced to raise prices above the exchange-rate factor, but sometimes they do,'' said Milton Pedraza of the Luxury Institute, a research group in New York. ''Why? They know that consumers are resilient. For manufacturers, it's really about asking for a price increase because you can.'' 
 Those remarks resonate with Jeffrey Kalinsky, a specialty retailer who owns fashion emporiums in New York and Atlanta. Mr. Kalinsky, who is also the director for designer merchandizing of Nordstrom, does not pretend to speak for his customers. But he shares their sometimes-irrational passions. He recalled that as long as 20 years ago, when he was in his mid-20s, he would ''just walk into a store and see a sweater, and something inside of me would say, 'Oh, I hope I can afford it. I bet it's at least $800.' ''That sweater would be $1,100,'' Mr. Kalinsky confided, ''but, miraculously, then I would want it more.'' 
 In some cases, manufacturers adjust prices upward to make sure that their goods hang in good company, displayed alongside prestigious luxury brands. ''They tack on a healthy premium, because they want to maintain the exclusivity of the brand,'' Mr. Pedraza said. ''The customer pays for that cachet.'' 
 Susan Sokol, the president of Vera Wang, acknowledged that while it is important to maintain a range of prices within a collection, ''it is extremely critical to understand price positioning and to be very strategic about it. 
 ''If I know our customer is buying Miu Miu or Dries van Noten,'' she said, ''we have to price accordingly.'' 
 The appetite for high-end wares has been a boon to retailers, who need to sell fewer of a given item to turn a handsome profit. The higher the price, the higher the margin, Mr. Burke pointed out: ''It's much easier to sell five of something really expensive than 20 of something less expensive.'' Markups, he said, have remained much the same since last year.
 A stroll through several high-end stores in Manhattan this week turned up prices that might be the equivalent of a down payment on a minivan. At Jeffrey, in the meatpacking district, a raglan-sleeve black jersey Lanvin dress was $2,455, a Shawn Collins thermal knit sweater $995. Barneys offerings included a Balenciaga leather bag with fancy grommets, $1,725; Lanvin leather ballet flats, $530; and Marc Jacobs cuffed leather ankle boots, $995.
 At Bergdorf Goodman, a Stella McCartney turtleneck devoid of trim sells for $995, and her cable-stitched sweater for $1,495. A pair of Kieselstein-Cord sunglasses is tagged at $595. Far from daunting, such a ticket might be downright seductive to customers, Ms. Sokol said. ''When you are looking at a handbag or even a pair of sunglasses, a high price can have inherent snob appeal.'' 
 Consumers tell themselves, Ms. Sokol went on, '' 'If those glasses are $150, I'm not going to be as interested as if they are $350.' '' 
 That is not to say that consumers are indifferent to price. Many are making emotional adjustments, finding ways to balance a love of fashion with the reality of its increasingly exorbitant cost. Eunice Ward, a lawyer in Chicago with a taste for quirky labels like Dolce & Gabbana and Stella McCartney, pays full price only for items that resonate with her sense of style. During a recent shopping trip, she spied a Yohji Yamomoto sweater. ''I knew it would fit with my wardrobe and update everything,'' she said, ''that it was going to be my workhorse for fall.
 ''I didn't even check the price at first. I knew I would love it, and I didn't care.''
 At Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan last week, Jessica Lee darted among the racks, gazing avidly at a champagne-colored Miu Miu cocktail dress, scarcely bothering to look at its $1,250 tag. ''Fashion's gotten more expensive,'' Ms. Lee said, a fact as inevitable, and untroubling, to her as the tide.
 ''The economy is good,'' said Ms. Lee, who works for a private equity firm in Manhattan. ''I've made a lot more over the past year than before, and so I have more purchasing power.''
 Kate Strachan appeared to be more circumspect. As a technical designer for a fashion house, she is well acquainted with the price of style. ''I know a lot of quality, craftsmanship and time goes into some of these pieces,'' Ms. Strachan said.
 Regardless, she is determined to put a cap on her spending. Combing the racks at Saks, she sighed wistfully: ''I can't afford these kinds of things, so usually I buy what I need most. This year that would be a winter coat.'' 
 Then with a self-mocking smile she added, ''Of course there are times when I'll splurge.''

HEADLINE: Lawyers Still Like Edwards, but Spread the Wealth

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
When he ran for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, John Edwards, who had gained fame as one of the nation's most successful trial lawyers, was the darling of many in the legal community, which opened its checkbooks and poured money into his campaign. 
 But this time around, Mr. Edwards is facing tough competition for those dollars. 
 While he is still No. 1 in the eyes of many trial lawyers and continues to depend heavily on donations from them, the other lawyers running for the 2008 Democratic nomination -- Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- are making inroads into his financial base, in part because the leading candidates' positions are so similar on many issues of interest to lawyers.
 ''John Edwards got a lot of people engaged the first time around, but now there are a lot more places to put their money,'' said Kirk Wagar, a Miami trial lawyer at Wagar, Murray & Feit, who supported the Kerry-Edwards ticket in 2004 but is now supporting Mr. Obama.
 As of the end of June, donations from lawyers accounted for little more than a fourth of the $23 million raised by Mr. Edwards. By comparison, lawyers donated roughly half the $12 million he had raised by the end of the first half of 2003, two and a half months before he officially declared his candidacy.
 Still, it is hard to overstate lawyer donations' continuing importance to Mr. Edwards's campaign. While he may trail Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama in the polls and in overall fund-raising, he is ahead, though slightly, in such contributions. Through the first two quarters of this year, he had received $6.5 million from lawyers, compared with $6.3 million for Mrs. Clinton and $5.5 million for Mr. Obama.
 In fact, of his campaign's top 20 donors, 15 are from law firms and 12 from the plaintiffs' bar. No other single industry accounted for more than 2 percent of the $23 million he raised through the first two quarters. Mr. Obama, who raised $59 million, and Mrs. Clinton, who raised $63 million, have tapped a far broader range of sectors.
 Mr. Edwards, who has repeatedly criticized Mrs. Clinton for refusing to turn away donations from lobbyists, was asked at the Democratic debate in Chicago on Tuesday about his own fund-raising among lawyers. He drew a distinction by saying the job of lobbyists ''is to rig this system against all of you.''
 Eric Schultz, a spokesman for the Edwards campaign, said the candidate was ''proud to receive support from people from all walks of life.''
 ''We're proud his former colleagues in the legal community recognize his willingness to fight the tough fights and to consistently win,'' Mr. Schultz said.
 At the recent convention of the American Association for Justice, formerly the American Association of Trial Lawyers, all three of the leading Democratic candidates spoke, as did Mr. Biden and a fifth hopeful, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico. By all accounts the loudest and warmest applause was reserved for Mr. Edwards. 
 ''He's a favorite son,'' said Linda Lipsen, chief lobbyist for the association. ''He's in our family.'' 
 But other candidates in this Democratic field are often just as strong as Mr. Edwards on issues important to the trial lawyers: the Bush administration's efforts to cap damage awards, to steer more legal disputes away from the courts and into binding arbitration, and to adopt what the lawyers see as pro-business regulatory changes.
 Philip Feldman, a San Francisco lawyer who co-founded Lawyers for Obama, said: ''The legal community is well represented in each camp. I don't think that John Edwards has all the trial lawyers sewn up.''
 Even the immediate past president of the trial lawyers' association, Kenneth M. Suggs, from Mr. Edwards's native state, South Carolina, is supporting an Edwards rival, Mr. Biden.
 Mr. Edwards does, however, have a hard core of trial lawyers who have supported him throughout his career and continue to do so. At the top of the list is another former president of the trial lawyers' association, Frederick M. Baron, one of the nation's most successful plaintiffs' lawyers, whose firm generated hundreds of millions of dollars by suing manufacturers of asbestos and other industrial products.
 Mr. Baron, who did not respond to a request for an interview, is Mr. Edwards's finance chairman and has made his Hawker 800 corporate jet available to the candidate at discount rates. Through 2004, he and his former law firm had donated $407,000 to Mr. Edwards's senatorial and presidential campaigns and his political committees, according to the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, in Washington. This year, Mr. Baron and his wife have donated $9,200 to the Edwards presidential candidacy, while his former law firm has donated $23,000.
 Another longtime Edwards supporter, Jere Locke Beasley, an Alabama lawyer who helped win an $11 billion damage award against ExxonMobil, said fund-raising was more difficult this year.
 ''The economy is so bad, it affects fund-raising,'' said Mr. Beasley, whose firm, Beasley Allen, has donated $59,100 to Mr. Edwards's campaign. ''Then you've got Hillary Clinton, who has unlimited access to money, and Barack Obama is a new guy. But I do think that John is in better shape than four years ago.'' 
 Fern Hurst, a New York philanthropist who is a leading backer of Mr. Edwards and is holding a fund-raiser for him today at her home in Aspen, Colo., said the Democratic field this year ''is so full, and the candidates are so good.''
 ''There's a lot of competition,'' Ms. Hurst said, ''and I also think a lot of people are sitting it out, waiting to see what happens in the primaries. But I find there are people supporting him and expressing doubts about the other candidates.''

HEADLINE: Pakistanis Express Ire At Army and Musharraf

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL and SOMINI SENGUPTA; Carlotta Gall reported from Islamabad, and Somini Sengupta from Islamabad and New Delhi. Salman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
''Before, our children would salute our soldiers when they passed. Now they spit on them.'' 
 That is how Zahoor Ahmed described the feelings of his hillside village, Kohu, a three-hour drive from the capital, Islamabad. It is a sentiment expressed openly in Pakistan these days, rare for a country where the military has long dominated everything, including the fear of speaking out. Mr. Ahmed's immediate anger was set off by the government's decision to storm the Red Mosque, an armed, pro-Taliban bastion in the heart of the capital, where several girls from his village attended a religious school. 
 But nearly eight years into Gen. Pervez Musharraf's rule as president of Pakistan, the Red Mosque siege is hardly the only cause for grievance. Conversations with ordinary Pakistanis reveal uncommonly outspoken anger and antipathy toward General Musharraf specifically and the military's involvement in politics generally. Analysts and opinion polls support the impression.
 ''The consensus that is emerging in Pakistan is that the military has no role in politics,'' said Rasul Baksh Rais, a professor of political science at Lahore University of Management Sciences. ''The military has lost its supporters in the media, in intelligentsia and also among politicians. As an institution it's really isolated. Its capability to dominate and control Pakistan is not possible anymore.'' 
 The broad dissatisfaction is rooted in many things, including a sense of everyday insecurity and rising prices, dislike of General Musharraf's alliance with the Bush administration and anger that the military has reaped rewards for itself but not fulfilled its promises to the people. 
 During General Musharraf's tenure, two of Pakistan's four provinces have turned to armed revolt against the military -- Baluchistan where tribe members are demanding more autonomy, and the tribal areas, where Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies have established a stronghold. 
 But the discontent also reaches into the corridors of government. Civil servants, university administrators and professors complain that civilians have been passed over for top jobs taken by military personnel. 
 A public opinion poll, part of which was released last week by the International Republican Institute, an American organization financed partly by the government and containing several prominent Republicans on its board, found that General Musharraf's approval ratings had plummeted to 34 percent from 60 percent in June 2006. Nearly two out of three Pakistanis polled said they believed he should not run for re-election. 
 The poll was based on interviews with 4,000 adults in rural and urban Pakistan between mid-June and early July, before the Red Mosque assault; it carried a margin of error of plus or minus 1.58 percentage points. 
 On whether the government had done a good job ''on issues important to you,'' 58 percent gave the government poor or very poor marks; 56 percent said they felt less safe than a year ago. 
 More detailed questions on the military, the results of which were to be released Thursday, showed that it remained one of the most highly regarded institutions in Pakistan, with a steady 80 percent approval rating. 
 But the poll also found that a growing number of people disapproved of the military's intrusion into civilian government. Sixty-two percent of respondents said General Musharraf should resign as army chief if he were to remain as president. 
 The president's spokesman, Gen. Rashid Qureishi, declined to comment on the poll results until he had seen them. But he said that General Musharraf declared in Karachi this week that he would run for re-election by the national and provincial assemblies between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15. ''Knowing him and gauging the public mood, we are very confident that he will win,'' said General Qureishi, who has retired from the military.
 Asked if the military's image had been damaged by its operations at the Red Mosque and in the tribal areas, where the government deployed additional Pakistani troops last month, the army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Waheed Arshad, maintained that they were carried out on the orders of the government and enjoyed broad public support. 
 ''It is up to the public from what perspective they look at it,'' he said. Referring to the Red Mosque siege, he added, ''It has had a positive effect because the operation was carried out against people who were using a place of worship for their own interests.'' 
 When he took power in a coup in 1999, General Musharraf was welcomed by Pakistanis disillusioned with years of unstable civilian governments dogged by corruption. He was at first credited with reining in some of the worst excesses of avaricious politicians and with overseeing a growing economy and a more open Pakistani society. 
 But since General Musharraf's pledge to cooperate with the United States-led battle against terrorism after Sept. 11, 2001, it is the military that has been by far the biggest beneficiary of about $10 billion in official American aid for Pakistan. 
 While the economy has expanded, so has the reach of the military's many enterprises, which extend into virtually every corner of the economy, including bottled water plants, cement factories and lucrative real estate developments. 
 ''Pakistan's military today runs a huge commercial enterprise,'' says Ayesha Siddiqa, author of a recent book, ''Military Inc.: Inside Pakistan's Military Economy,'' in which she estimates that the military's internal economy is worth billions of dollars. 
 The military's dominance of the political, economic and social life of Pakistan has matured to such an extent under General Musharraf, Ms. Siddiqa contends, that the military has ensured a long-term, if not permanent, role for itself in politics. ''Even members of the opposition and civil society have openly or discreetly admitted that the organization cannot be got rid of,'' she said.
 That higher visibility also means that the military is blamed for many problems. Complaints about government corruption are still common. So is grumbling about the military government's inability to control inflation or to maintain law and order. 
 Uncertainty pervaded even Rawalpindi, the neighboring garrison town. 
 Muhammad Rasheed, 80, a roadside barber complained about the rising prices of flour and oil, saying he could not afford even to replace the broken mirrors on his wall. Then he complained about insecurity. 
 ''There is no law here,'' he said. ''The government has no control. Musharraf can't even shake hands with ordinary people. He is so scared of his life.''
 Aqeel Anjum, 19, a laborer nearby, said the army had failed to ''feed the stomachs of the poor'' and accused it of pocketing money meant for development. 
 The general's own political missteps have not helped, including his attempt in March to oust Pakistan's chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, a move overturned by the Supreme Court. In the International Republican Institute poll, 72 percent opposed the president's decision. 
 As General Musharraf's standing has eroded, speculation has grown about a possible power-sharing deal with his political nemesis, the opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, who lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai and London to avoid corruption charges.
 This week there was fresh talk that General Musharraf was considering a state of emergency, which his information minister, Tariq Azeem, told The Associated Press, ''cannot be ruled out.''
 Such a step would give General Musharraf and the military enhanced powers and postpone elections, and only insert the military all the more into the running of government. It would also probably meet strong resistance from the political opposition and could risk even greater instability, already a chronic problem in the country. 
 A World Bank assessment recently ranked Pakistan in the lowest 10th percentile for political stability and said corruption was as bad as it was in 1998. 
 That was just a year before General Musharraf seized power from Ms. Bhutto's successor, Nawaz Sharif, accusing him of gross corruption and mismanagement.

HEADLINE: Industrial Echoes in Michigan's Copper Country

BYLINE: By STEPHEN REGENOLD

 BODY:
FOUR hundred feet underground, in a musty, dripping passage into the Quincy Mine, Ed Yarbrough pointed to a dark opening in the wall. ''Here's an old explosives bin,'' he said, tracing a flashlight beam along the rock, ''hence the no-smoking sign.''
 We were in the belly of a copper mine, a quarter-mile down a tunnel, light leaking faintly from bulbs strung overhead. Water dripped off the ceiling. Cold air seeped from an abysmal black beyond. Then Mr. Yarbrough, our guide, turned off the lights.
 It was a Saturday afternoon, cloudy and cool aboveground in Hancock, Mich., where the Quincy Mine Hoist Association runs tours of a long-shut operation. My wife, Tara, and I were traveling with our 20-month-old daughter, Gwen, on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a northeast-pointing appendage in Lake Superior that has deep forests, mines, tiny towns and little else. 
 ''This is how the old miners worked,'' Mr. Yarbrough said, lighting a match. He touched off a small candle, its wick flickering to life. ''Now picture swinging a sledgehammer,'' he said.
 The Keweenaw Peninsula -- 75 miles long, 40 miles wide at its base and tapering to a point -- is a wilderness of stunted stone mountains, mossy forests and sparse settlements born in a mining boom. Dark bubbling streams cut rocky ravines in the woods. Lake Superior is always close by, lapping the land from the east, west and north.
 The region on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, still sometimes called Copper Country, was a promised land for hundreds of thousands of immigrants -- German, Italian, Cornish, French-Canadian and Finnish -- who came to pick and drill at operations like the Quincy Mine. For 150 years starting in the 1840s, billions of pounds of ore were pulled from the vast basalt substratum of the Keweenaw, which boasts some of the purest copper ever found. But the mines have all closed down. Loading docks on Superior's shore sit idle. The population on the peninsula has halved since its peak 100 years ago.
 Today, tourism has supplanted mining as a main industry. Small towns, notably Houghton, Hancock, Calumet and Copper Harbor, cater to travelers who make the long drive north from Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee or Detroit. A national historical park, mine tours, inns, gift shops, pubs and hiking trails occupy summertime visitors. 
 Beach lovers visit the Keweenaw for its half-moons of sand, where translucent-blue water washes arching shores. Rock hunters pick among water-worn stones for agates, some big as golf balls, glinting in the sun.
 Our trip to the region, a three-day getaway, included the requisite Copper Country circuit -- the Quincy Mine tour, a couple of museums, a copper gift shop -- plus hiking and beach-walking on stretches of sandy shore. At McLain State Park, west 15 miles from Hancock, we plunked down on a dune the first night to watch an aptly copper-colored sunset, dusty light bouncing off Superior's platinum plane. Inland, we hiked mossy trails with the baby in a backpack carrier, rarely seeing another soul.
 ''It's like Sweden up here,'' Tara commented at one point, reminded of our trip the summer before. Indeed, the Keweenaw Peninsula is a simulacrum to parts of Scandinavia, boreal and moist, with big stones poking out of piney hills -- terrain that keeps you thinking a gnome might skitter by.
 Culturally, there are deep Nordic ties. Vowels are stretched and prolonged in speech. Road signs in Hancock offer English and Finnish, Ravine Street doubling as Kurukatu Street in the downtown. Saunas are common.
 At sites like the Hanka Homestead Museum, a preserved farm near Keweenaw Bay on the east side of the peninsula, you can snoop through a former Finnish settlement. Its granary, barns, sauna and stable are classic Nordic log construction, preserved to their 1920s appearance. Like many area attractions, the Hanka Homestead is linked to Keweenaw National Historical Park, a preserve of disparate sites established in 1992. Mines, museums, a municipally built opera house, an old 45-room mansion, McLain State Park and Fort Wilkins, a Civil War-era military base, are operated by or partners with the National Park Service.
 The national historic park has headquarters in the old ornate brick and stone buildings of the Calumet & Hecla Mining Company halfway up the peninsula, but has no formal visitor's center. Its boundaries are vague. We drove from site to site using a National Park Service brochure as guide.
 ''We're not your typical national park,'' said Frank Fiala, a former superintendent, who retired in January. ''This isn't Yellowstone.'' 
 To be sure, the human story of life and times on the peninsula -- not nature -- is stressed at the park. Structures like as the Nordberg Steam Hoist, an engineering marvel that managed a 13,000-foot steel shaft cable in the Quincy Mine, are open for tours. Slag piles, smokestacks, rusting machinery and fenced-off copper smelting plants are among the places to visit, some worth the effort, others maybe not.
 On our trip, after the mine tour and some time on the beach and in the forest, we simply explored the main streets of Calumet, Houghton and Hancock, where storefront windows glint with copper trinkets, stained glass for sale, and workaday fare.
 Our favorite shop, Copper World, on Fifth Street in Calumet, has been selling all things copper since the early 1970s. ''My uncle worked 45 years for Calumet & Hecla,'' said Tony Bausano, the shop's 52-year-old proprietor. Mr. Bausano has worked the counter at Copper World since 1977, selling jewelry, tea kettles, clocks, cake pans, ornaments, knickknacks and postcards pressed with scenes -- all incorporating the pinkish-orange metal found underground.
 ''My family started this store to sell what our grandfathers mined,'' he said.
 CALUMET, a company town to its teeth for decades during its heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was cosmopolitan and cultured in its time, with sculptured art, commissioned architecture and a public bathhouse. Streetcars, paved roads, electric streetlights and a multilingual library for the town's immigrant groups were innovations for their time and place. In 1848, this remote city almost became the state's capital before losing narrowly to Lansing. 
 But today Calumet is consummately sleepy, with fewer than 1,000 citizens and not a whole lot going on. We walked through downtown, where old mining buildings sat empty and quiet, with only their ghosts. 
 In 1913, Mother Jones traveled to Calumet to stand with striking copper miners. It was hard to imagine any type of ruckus there today. 
 My wife and I stayed in Houghton, a sister city to Hancock -- the two are separated by a deep blue canal of Lake Superior that splices off the tip of the Keweenaw. There were slag piles and smelters on the Hancock side; Houghton had huge rusting boat cleats along its shore. Seagulls coasted overhead. 
 Michigan Technological University, east of downtown in Houghton, attracts 6,500 students and gives the area a singular economic boost and the characteristic advantages of a college town. Houghton's city center -- a classic big-windowed and brick-laden Middle American downtown -- was sleepy during our stay but alive, with bars, restaurants, a coffee shop and some retailing. There's a nice walk along the canal, called Portage Lake in that area, with signboard pictorials outlining the shipping lane's history and significance in delivering copper to the world.
 On Shelden Avenue in the main strip of downtown Houghton, I snooped in a bookstore, discovering delights like ''Mines, Maps & Shafts,'' a small detailed book with 19th-century illustrations, and ''And Whose Hills You Shall Mine,'' which documents Copper Country's boom times from 1845 to 1910.
 At the end of the trip, we sampled the pasty -- a hot meat pie that's become a culinary icon of the Keweenaw -- at the Kaleva Cafe in downtown Hancock, below a big slope going up to the Quincy Mine where we'd toured the dripping passage the day before. 
 From our table, I pictured the tunnels and shafts hollowing out the hill, deep paths underground following veins of copper thousands of feet down. Glasses and plates clinked inside the cafe. Traffic groaned past outside, travelers heading uphill under trees, disappearing into the heart of Copper Country beyond.
 VISITOR INFORMATION
 IT is essential to have a car on the Keweenaw Peninsula. Most tourist sites are along Route 26 or in the cities of Houghton, Hancock, Calumet and Copper Harbor. Rental cars are available at Houghton County Memorial Airport, which is served by major airlines. Minneapolis, Chicago and Milwaukee are all six or more hours away by car.
 Keweenaw National Historical Park (www.nps.gov/kewe), a conglomeration of sites, provides a brochure with maps. For a taste of the natural setting, head to McLain State Park (18350 Highway M-203; 906-482-0278), west of Hancock, or to one of the giant half-moon beaches along Route 26 west of Copper Harbor, where Lake Superior stretches endless and deep blue to mesh with sky. 
 Accommodations range from chain hotels in Houghton, including the Best Western Franklin Square Inn (820 Shelden Avenue, 888-487-1700; $104 a night), to cozy lodges like the Dapple-Gray Bed & Breakfast, a log building facing Lake Superior with a sauna and a 28-foot-high fireplace (13640 Highway M-26; 866-909-1233; www.dapple-gray.com; starting at $150).
 The Ambassador Restaurant in Houghton (126 Shelden Avenue. 906-482-5054) serves pizza and beer in a cozy setting with stained-glass windows. For a pasty, the pocket meat pie synonymous with the Keweenaw, try the Kaleva Cafe (234 Quincy Street, Hancock, 906-482-6001) .

HEADLINE: Shaky Markets Prompt Rumors of Who's in Trouble

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL; Eric Dash and Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The global stock and bond markets these days seem to be playing a giant game of hide and seek. 
 In this version, played on a global field, investors are scrambling to discover which banks, hedge funds or public companies are holding potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans and subprime-related mortgage securities that are imploding.
 On any given day, traders are exchanging rumors of a hedge fund that has blown up or a Wall Street brokerage firm that has incurred losses in subprime or other mortgage-related securities, creating a frenzy and a whipsaw of trading activity in the stock and bond markets. 
 So far, most rumors have turned out to be unsubstantiated and untrue. Still, exposure to and losses from subprime and other mortgage-related securities are being revealed, slowly, in all corners of the world. 
 Yesterday France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, stopped withdrawals from three of its asset-backed securities funds, saying it could no longer value them accurately because of problems in the subprime market in the United States. 
 Also yesterday, the insurance giant American International Group revealed that it held $28.7 billion in subprime securities, but that given its size, it was not under any pressure to sell the securities at a loss.
 Already the turmoil in the mortgage market has led Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, to bail out a bank, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, that held subprime investments. Several hedge funds in the United States, four in Australia and at least four additional funds in Europe have either closed or halted investor withdrawals as they sort out the value of their subprime and other mortgage-related investments.
 In reaction to the growing losses on subprime mortgages and related securities, the European Central Bank stepped in yesterday morning and provided $130.2 billion in emergency loans to European banks while the Federal Reserve injected $24 billion in liquidity into the United States banking system.
 Capital markets have undergone periods of extreme turmoil and lack of liquidity in the past. In 1998, the credit markets virtually froze up after the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management buckled and Russia defaulted on its debts. Many investors dumped mortgage securities into the market and prices tumbled. 
 Yet, the nervousness seems more intense given the amount of leverage, or borrowed money, that had been made available to hedge fund investors in the subprime and mortgage arena. The use of borrowed money, along with the sheer size of the mortgage market, should only worsen investor losses.
 ''This is a market that has grown tremendously in the last five years,'' said Professor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh of the Stern School of Business at New York University, ''and whereas a lot of the mortgages were previously held by banks, now, particularly with subprime mortgages, they are held by a lot of new players who are essentially just getting used to them.''
 Last year, Wall Street firms issued $773 billion in mortgage-related securities, up from $217 billion in 2001, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
 Yet trying to ferret out which one of these relatively new players will be the next to report big losses on subprime or mortgage-related securities, whether they be an Asian bank or American hedge fund, is difficult.
 Unlike investors who hold large stakes in publicly traded American stocks, and must report those holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, no central government agency or private organization tracks who may be holding subprime or other mortgage-related securities in any detail. (The United States Treasury does track broad foreign country holdings of American mortgage securities.) 
 ''I don't think any of the regulators have a handle on where the net exposure of subprime is,'' said Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics, which builds risk systems for regulators and auditors. 
 Mr. Whalen said the situation was worse in Europe, where even less public data was available. 
 Furthermore, because of accounting rules, some holders of these mortgage-backed securities do not have to own up to or recognize any losses until they actually sell them.
 But these days, trying to value certain subprime securities or the more complicated collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, which are pools of mortgage securities, is difficult as well. 
 Unlike stocks that trade openly on exchanges and whose value can easily be determined at any point of the day, mortgage-related securities and C.D.O.'s change hands behind the scenes via individual bids and offers made on trading desks across Wall Street.
 And while, typically, billions of dollars of securities can move in and out of these markets with great ease, in recent weeks trading in mortgage-related has seized up because Wall Street firms are reluctant to buy or sell them, many traders and portfolio managers said.
 Trading in C.D.O.'s has become a ''standoff'' said James L. Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a New York-based hedge fund. 
 Jokingly, Mr. Melcher said the attitude of some investors in C.D.O.'s seems to be: ''I am dancing here. Don't bother me about this iceberg we have hit.''
 If there is an upside to the mortgage meltdown, some analysts said, it may be that because these securities are held by so many investors the pain will be spread among many market participants instead of taking down a large single financial institution.
 Indeed, two rating agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, said this week that the large American investment banks face modest risks and manageable losses because of subprime-mortgage losses.
 ''The good news is that the losses will be widely distributed across the different owners of these pools of securities,'' said Stuart A. Gabriel, a finance professor at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 ''The bad news,'' he said, ''is because of the difficulties in valuing these mortgage pools and the high levels of uncertainty and panic that have set into these markets, we have a situation where there is a severe lack of liquidity in the mortgage market and that has created an extremely dangerous situation for our economy and the global economy.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Aug. 10 about international fallout from troubles in the United States' subprime mortgage market misidentified the bank that bailed out IKB Deutsche Industriebank, which held subprime investments. It was the government-owned KfW development bank, which is IKB's largest shareholder -- not the Bundesbank, which is the central German bank.

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble as French Bank Reacts to Home Loan Worries

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS. 
Vikas Bajaj in New York, James Kanter in Paris and Julia Werdigier in London contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks dropped sharply as soon as trading opened today after a French bank, BNP Paribas, suspended operations of three of its funds in the wake of turmoil in the American market for home loans and the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve injected cash into the financial system because of tightening credit markets.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points, or 1.5 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index were down just as much. Stocks remained volatile through the morning, and at 11:40 a.m., the Dow was down about 140 points, or 1 percent. The S.&P. 500 was off by about 1.2 percent, while the Nasdaq was down about 0.5 percent. 
 Asked at a news conference this morning whether he thought the turmoil in the subprime lending market could put a chill on credit in the broader economy, President Bush said, ''The fundamentals of our economy are strong,'' adding, ''I'm told there is enough liquidity to enable the system to correct.'' 
 The market appeared to react positively to remarks by Mr. Bush that the administration would not favor changing the way partners in private equity firms are taxed. In recent months, several prominent lawmakers have proposed subjecting the investment gains of fund managers -- known as ''carried interest'' -- to the ordinary income tax rate of up to 35 percent, rather than the capital gains rate of 15 percent.
 Noting that partnerships are a common structure among small businesses, Mr. Bush said he was satisfied with the current tax structure. ''We are very, very hesitant about trying to target one aspect of limited partnerships,'' he said, ''for fear of it affecting small business growth.'' 
 Carried interest has come under criticism because it has allowed managers of private equity firms and hedge funds to pay very little in taxes on income they derive largely from managing their investors' assets rather than putting their own capital at risk.
 The latest upheaval on Wall Street came after a sell-off in Europe, which was prompted after BNP, the largest publicly traded bank in France, became the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several large companies have already announced losses.
 A German central bank meeting was under way to discuss details of a rescue package for the lender IKB, another victim of exposure to the crisis in subprime lending.
 Jonathan Mullen, a spokesman for BNP, said that the credit squeeze in the United States had made it impossible to calculate the value of the underlying assets of the funds and that the bank was obliged by market conditions to halt holders of the funds from cashing out or new investors from buying shares in the funds.
 ''It's quite exceptional to suspend funds, and it means that people can't buy in or sell out of the funds,'' Mr. Mullen said. ''But we hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back.''
 Mr. Mullen said that about one-third of the funds were exposed to subprime loans but that those investments were in high quality parts of that market. ''We've seen no degradation in the quality of these assets, none of which have been put on watch for a downgrade,'' Mr. Mullen said. ''This is just a technical problem about liquidity.''
 With banks pulling back on lending over all, the European Central Bank lent more than $130 billion overnight at a rate of 4 percent to inject cash into the financial system, and the Federal Reserve added $24 billion in temporary reserves to the United States banking system.
 A key question is whether some European lenders know the full extent of their exposure to the subprime lending crisis. Only last week, BNP's chief executive, Baudouin Prot, said the bank's exposure to subprime woes was ''absolutely negligible.''
 BNP shares fell more than 5 percent in early trading, but Mr. Mullen reiterated that the bank itself had almost no exposure to the subprime crisis. He said the funds are held by BNP clients and represent just a fraction, or 1.6 billion euros, of the 600 billion euros the bank currently has under management.
 Some analysts have said it is difficult to determine the exposure of banks to the United States subprime market because they are often held through collateralized debt obligations, financial products that bundle securities and help spread risks, and banks often do not disclose their exposure.
 Standard & Poor's, the debt rating agency, in July cut credit ratings on $6.39 billion of bonds backed by subprime mortgages.
 Fitch Ratings said it was reviewing $7.1 billion, including 19 collateralized debt obligations, for a possible downgrade.
 Concern among investors about possible effects of subprime investments and recent woes in the credit markets have outweighed rising earnings at European banks last month.
 Shares of Deutsche Bank and BNP dropped on Aug. 1 even though both reported better-than-expected profit in the first half. Investors are reducing their exposure to banks with large investment banking arms, fearing losses from leveraged loans they have underwritten but cannot sell on to investors.
 Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said earlier this month that while exposures to subprime may lead to ''modest losses or slightly lower revenue'' among European banks -- but that would be ''entirely manageable.''

HEADLINE: Modern Finance Suffers Its Version Of Run on the Bank

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A few generations ago, savers responded to financial panics with runs on banks, and even healthy institutions could fail if they could not raise enough cash quickly enough.
 For a long time, that all seemed to be safely relegated to the past. But now the runs are back -- and this time the targets are not banks but the securities that have replaced them as the prime generators of credit in the new financial system.
 ''Our current system of levered finance and its related structures may be critically flawed,'' said William H. Gross, the chief investment officer of Pimco, a mutual fund company. ''Nothing within it allows for the hedging of liquidity risk, and that is the problem at the moment.''
 This problem has plagued the United States at regular intervals. The Panic of 1907 was halted only when the banker J. P. Morgan persuaded banks to stand together and halt the string of closings by lending money to threatened institutions. That led to the creation of the Federal Reserve, as Congress recoiled from the notion that the country's financial health had relied on the wealth and wisdom of one private citizen. 
 Then the Depression, with a wave of bank failures, led to the establishment of deposit insurance. With that, savers became convinced that they need not worry about the health of their bank, and bank runs vanished.
 But a new financial architecture emerged in the last decade -- one that relied more on securities and less on banks as intermediaries. With the worth of those securities now being questioned -- and no equivalent of deposit insurance -- some who financed the securities want their money out, a fact that has created the 21st-century equivalent of a run on a bank.
 Left to deal with the run are the institutions that were created to deal with the old system's problems -- notably the central banks like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. But, in contrast to their close involvement with the banking system, these banks have little regulatory oversight of the securities that are in trouble and may not even know who is holding them. 
 At the heart of the new system was a decision to have loans financed directly by investors, rather than indirectly by bank depositors. Investors, ranging from hedge funds to wealthy individuals, had confidence in the arrangement because most of the securities were blessed as very safe by the bond rating agencies, like Moody's and Standard & Poor's. 
 The highly rated securities pay relatively low interest rates, but until now there were many willing to own them or to lend money to those who did own them. But there is no reason to hold them if there is any question about their safety -- just as there was no reason to keep deposits in a bank that was facing a run amid rumors about its safety.
 A result has been a freezing up of markets for many securities that, it turns out, were critical to the free flowing of credit. The problem first gained widespread attention when two hedge funds run by the brokerage firm Bear Stearns collapsed and a third Bear Stearns fund had to suspend redemptions as investors sought to get out even though there was no evidence that the fund was in trouble.
 ''The third Bear Stearns fund announcement was the key,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. ''You have to believe that in the hedge fund and mutual fund complexes, there is a decision that is building that says, 'I want to hold some Treasuries to have a cushion if I see redemptions.' '' 
 The basis of the system was a belief that securities backed by bad credit could be very safe -- so long as there were other securities that would suffer the first losses that came from defaults in pools of subprime mortgages or of loans to highly leveraged companies.
 So far, none of those highly rated securities have failed to make their interest payments on time, but that fact is not enough to make anyone want to buy them. The rating agencies have downgraded some securities, and they are tightening their standards for new ratings.
 Early this week, stock market investors around the world tried to reassure themselves that nothing was really wrong, and financial stocks bounced back after suffering sharp declines last week. Analysts argued that profits remained strong, as does world economic growth.
 On Tuesday, the Fed declined to lower the federal funds rate, saying that despite financial market volatility and a decline in the housing market, ''the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.''
 But that comforting outlook did not help the credit markets recover, or persuade anyone to buy the newly questioned securities -- at least at anything like the prices people had assumed. No one wants to sell the securities at very low prices -- and in many cases they have borrowed heavily against them. So the markets have dried up.
 Yesterday, BNP Paribas, a major French bank, said it could no longer value three investment funds that it managed, whose assets had been invested in highly rated securities that were backed by dubious mortgages.
 ''The complete evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments of the U.S. securitization market,'' the French bank said, ''has made it impossible to value certain assets fairly, regardless of their quality or credit rating.''
 Adding to the problem is that the questionable securities are widely owned and sometimes have been repackaged to form the basis of other securities. European banks and funds own paper tied to subprime mortgages, and it is not clear who else does, or how investors will react.
 Banks that are worried about their own liquidity decided this week to increase their reserves, which they can do by borrowing from other banks. Loans on such rates rose as a result of the added demand. Both the federal funds rate -- the rate on loans of reserves between American banks -- and the London Interbank Offered Rate leaped sharply yesterday.
 The Fed -- which conducts monetary policy by focusing on the fed funds rate -- was forced to inject money into the system to bring the rate back down to its targeted level. And the E.C.B. lent almost 100 billion euros ($130 billion), to European banks.
 If the current panic is just that -- unreasoning fear -- then such cash infusions may be able to let the new financial system weather the storm. Money can be lent to those owning the dubious securities, obviating the need to sell. As they eventually turn out to be good, the loans can be repaid and all will be happy.
 On the other hand, if many of those securities turn out to be as bad as people now fear, some of those loans will not be good, and there may be more financial failures.
 Yesterday, stock prices fell in Europe and kept declining in the United States, amid speculation over what other owners of the securities might surface as having problems. But American stock prices remain well above the levels they fell to in February, after a sudden drop in the Chinese stock market, and many stock investors still think all will work out acceptably.
 The central banks, while clearly crucial to dealing with the loss of faith in the new financial system, lost influence under that system. Loans could be arranged by nonbanks, not subject to bank regulators, and the regulators were hesitant to impose rules that would not apply to all lenders. The lenders sold securities to finance mortgages that let people borrow at rates that -- temporarily -- were far lower than theFed envisioned. That delayed the impact of the Fed's attempts to raise interest rates in 2005 and 2006. 
 ''That is important because it means the decline in the housing market is likely to continue,'' Mr. Barbera said. If the American economy does continue to weaken, the Fed may feel forced to reduce interest rates sooner than it had expected, even if that move threatens to hurt the value of the dollar. 
 Prices in the futures market for federal funds show that just a few weeks ago investors thought there would be no Fed easing this year. Now they seem to think such a move is highly likely, and some expect it as early as next month.
 But the Fed's influence is limited when lenders are suddenly risk-averse. ''The impetus of lowering interest rates may not help, if they don't let you borrow in the first place,'' said Kingman Penniman, the president of KDP Investment Advisors.
 The new financial system is not the one the Fed was created to deal with, but it is the one it must try to handle.

HEADLINE: Big French Bank Suspends Funds

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
The French bank BNP Paribas suspended operations of three of its funds and the European Central Bank injected cash into the financial system, both in the wake of turmoil in the United States mortgage market.
 The European Central Bank lent 94.8 billion euros, or $130.1 billion, to meet banks' needs after demand for cash in the European money markets drove interest rates higher. The central bank, taking such emergency action for the first time since just after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, said it would provide unlimited amounts at 4 percent, its current benchmark rate.
 The actions initiated a sell-off in European markets that spilled over into the United States. 
 BNP is the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several major companies have already announced losses.
 A German central bank meeting was under way today to discuss details of a rescue package for the lender IKB Deutsche Industriebank, another victim of exposure to the crisis in subprime lending. Also today, the Dutch lender NIBC Holding said it had lost $189 million on United States mortgage investments.
 Jonathan Mullen, a spokesman for BNP, said that the credit squeeze in the United States had made it impossible to calculate the value of the underlying assets of the funds and that the bank was obliged by market conditions to halt holders of the funds from cashing out or new investors from buying shares.
 ''It's quite exceptional to suspend funds, and it means that people can't buy in or sell out of the funds,'' Mr. Mullen said. ''But we hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back.''
 Mr. Mullen said that about one-third of the funds were exposed to subprime loans but that those investments were in high-quality parts of that market. ''We've seen no degradation in the quality of these assets, none of which have been put on watch for a downgrade,'' he said. ''This is just a technical problem about liquidity.''
 A crucial question is whether some European lenders know the full extent of their exposure to the subprime lending crisis. Only last week, Baudouin Prot, the chief executive of BNP, said the bank's exposure to subprime woes was ''absolutely negligible.''
 BNP shares were down more than 5 percent in afternoon trading in Paris, but Mr. Mullen reiterated that the bank itself had almost no exposure to the subprime crisis. He said the funds are held by BNP clients and represented just a fraction, about 1.6 billion euros of the 600 billion euros the bank has under management.
 Some analysts have said it is difficult to determine banks' exposure to the United States subprime market because they are often held through collateralized debt obligations, financial products that bundle securities and help spread risks, and banks often do not disclose their exposure.
 The debt-rating agency Standard & Poor's cut credit ratings in July on $6.39 billion worth of bonds backed by subprime mortgages.
 Fitch Ratings said it was reviewing $7.1 billion, including 19 collateralized debt obligations, for a possible downgrade.
 Concern among investors about the possible effects of subprime investments and recent woes in the credit markets have outweighed rising earnings at European banks last month.
 Shares of Deutsche Bank and BNP dropped last week, even though both reported better-than-expected profit in the first half. Investors are reducing their exposure to banks with large investment banking arms.

HEADLINE: The Farm You Want (1 Letter)

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 ''A Factory Farm Near You'' (editorial, July 31) is in a time warp. 
 Yes, concentrated animal feeding operations, or ''factory farms'' as you call them, are a key feature of modern agriculture. And, yes, they are increasing in number as farmers attempt to survive the challenges of modern global agricultural economics. But today these livestock operations don't have to be unwelcome neighbors in their communities. 
 You did not mention the tremendous progress made in ensuring that these farms are environmentally sound. At least as far as hog farms are concerned, catastrophic manure spills are a thing of the past. In fact, the study cited in the editorial had to reach back eight years to 1999 to find a major environmental problem associated with hog farming. 
 America's pork producers have met the environmental challenges and are proud of their achievements. The pork industry has acted on its own over the last decade to solve water-discharge problems and create top-shelf manure management systems. Producers like me are ready to comply with tough new Environmental Protection Agency regulations that protect the nation's water supply, by adopting a policy of zero discharge into rivers and streams. 
 There are still challenges remaining, such as tackling the issue of unpleasant odors emanating from hog farms, and pork producers continue to address this issue. Recently they have invested millions of dollars into research conducted by Purdue University. But the progress of the last decade should not be ignored.

HEADLINE: Credit Card Legislation (1 Letter)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Credit Card Buyer Beware'' (editorial, July 31) doesn't recognize the unintended consequences that onerous federal legislation could have on consumers. 
 A recent Government Accountability Office study confirms that the highly competitive credit card market benefits consumers, with average interest rates declining 6 percent between 1990 and 2004. The Federal Reserve has also found that most Americans successfully manage their credit card debt, with balances declining from 3.9 percent of average household income in 1995 to just 3.0 percent in 2004. 
 The credit card industry is constantly evolving. We are working with policy makers to ensure that lending terms and conditions are clearly outlined. With extensive financial literacy efforts, we are helping customers make the best, most informed decisions for their individual situations. 
 However, we must guard against overly restrictive legislation that could reduce the availability of credit to low- and moderate-income consumers and increase the costs for those who use their credit cards responsibly. In the end, this would ultimately hurt the very consumers such legislation might seek to protect.

HEADLINE: Very Scary Things

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In September 1998, the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, a giant hedge fund, led to a meltdown in the financial markets similar, in some ways, to what's happening now. During the crisis in '98, I attended a closed-door briefing given by a senior Federal Reserve official, who laid out the grim state of the markets. ''What can we do about it?'' asked one participant. ''Pray,'' replied the Fed official.
 Our prayers were answered. The Fed coordinated a rescue for L.T.C.M., while Robert Rubin, the Treasury secretary at the time, and Alan Greenspan, who was the Fed chairman, assured investors that everything would be all right. And the panic subsided. 
 Yesterday, President Bush, showing off his M.B.A. vocabulary, similarly tried to reassure the markets. But Mr. Bush is, let's say, a bit lacking in credibility. On the other hand, it's not clear that anyone could do the trick: right now we're suffering from a serious shortage of saviors. And that's too bad, because we might need one.
 What's been happening in financial markets over the past few days is something that truly scares monetary economists: liquidity has dried up. That is, markets in stuff that is normally traded all the time -- in particular, financial instruments backed by home mortgages -- have shut down because there are no buyers. 
 This could turn out to be nothing more than a brief scare. At worst, however, it could cause a chain reaction of debt defaults.
 The origins of the current crunch lie in the financial follies of the last few years, which in retrospect were as irrational as the dot-com mania. The housing bubble was only part of it; across the board, people began acting as if risk had disappeared. 
 Everyone knows now about the explosion in subprime loans, which allowed people without the usual financial qualifications to buy houses, and the eagerness with which investors bought securities backed by these loans. But investors also snapped up high-yield corporate debt, a k a junk bonds, driving the spread between junk bond yields and U.S. Treasuries down to record lows.
 Then reality hit -- not all at once, but in a series of blows. First, the housing bubble popped. Then subprime melted down. Then there was a surge in investor nervousness about junk bonds: two months ago the yield on corporate bonds rated B was only 2.45 percent higher than that on government bonds; now the spread is well over 4 percent.
 Investors were rattled recently when the subprime meltdown caused the collapse of two hedge funds operated by Bear Stearns, the investment bank. Since then, markets have been manic-depressive, with triple-digit gains or losses in the Dow Jones industrial average -- the rule rather than the exception for the past two weeks.
 But yesterday's announcement by BNP Paribas, a large French bank, that it was suspending the operations of three of its own funds was, if anything, the most ominous news yet. The suspension was necessary, the bank said, because of ''the complete evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments'' -- that is, there are no buyers.
 When liquidity dries up, as I said, it can produce a chain reaction of defaults. Financial institution A can't sell its mortgage-backed securities, so it can't raise enough cash to make the payment it owes to institution B, which then doesn't have the cash to pay institution C -- and those who do have cash sit on it, because they don't trust anyone else to repay a loan, which makes things even worse.
 And here's the truly scary thing about liquidity crises: it's very hard for policy makers to do anything about them. 
 The Fed normally responds to economic problems by cutting interest rates -- and as of yesterday morning the futures markets put the probability of a rate cut by the Fed before the end of next month at almost 100 percent. It can also lend money to banks that are short of cash: yesterday the European Central Bank, the Fed's trans-Atlantic counterpart, lent banks $130 billion, saying that it would provide unlimited cash if necessary, and the Fed pumped in $24 billion.
 But when liquidity dries up, the normal tools of policy lose much of their effectiveness. Reducing the cost of money doesn't do much for borrowers if nobody is willing to make loans. Ensuring that banks have plenty of cash doesn't do much if the cash stays in the banks' vaults. 
 There are other, more exotic things the Fed and, more important, the executive branch of the U.S. government could do to contain the crisis if the standard policies don't work. But for a variety of reasons, not least the current administration's record of incompetence, we'd really rather not go there.
 Let's hope, then, that this crisis blows over as quickly as that of 1998. But I wouldn't count on it.

HEADLINE: The Straw Poll Man

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Early on, before the campaigning begins in earnest, presidential candidates lunch with journalists in order to get acquainted. During one of these lunches, Mitt Romney was talking about the global economy and was asked why he thought some nations grew rich and others didn't.
 He said there are at least two schools of thought on this question, one associated with Jared Diamond of U.C.L.A., which emphasizes natural resources, and another associated with the Harvard historian David Landes, which emphasizes culture. Over the next several minutes, he weaved the two theories together, siding a bit more with Landes. 
 The answer demonstrated an ability to handle contradictory information streams. From it, you could see how Romney had managed to graduate with honors from Harvard Law School, while graduating in the top 5 percent of his class at Harvard Business School. You could see how he managed to start Bain Capital and turn it into a $4 billion firm, doubling the return on investment every single year, on average. You could see how he turned around the Salt Lake City Olympics and passed bipartisan health care reform in Massachusetts.
 You could also see a natural theory for his presidential campaign. Romney would be Mr. Execution. He'd be the one who could untangle complex problems. He'd take on the challenges of a rising China and globalization. He'd defuse the ticking time bomb of entitlement debt. As the Democrats went anti-corporate populist, he'd run as a responsible, businesslike steward.
 But execution has not been the central theme of the Romney campaign. Instead Romney has highlighted ideology, and molded himself to fit the G.O.P. electorate.
 This electorate has changed, even in the past 10 years. As a study by Fabrizio, McLaughlin and Associates demonstrates, Republicans are more conservative than even a decade ago. Seventy-one percent are self-declared conservatives, compared to 55 percent in 1997. Republicans are much older. Forty-one percent of Republicans are over 55, compared to 28 percent a decade ago.
 Republicans are also much less economics-oriented. A decade ago, the party had thriving deficit hawk and supply-side factions. Now the thriving groups, as the study indicates, are organized around issues like immigration, terrorism and stem cell research.
 Romney's campaign conforms to those interests. Its animating idea is that Romney is the true inheritor of the Reagan mantle. This means the central word in his speeches is not ''competence,'' but ''strength'' (Giuliani's turf). Instead of emphasizing data and pragmatism, he emphasizes creed and conviction. 
 His campaign is oddly short on autobiography. He talks about his family, which is wholesome, but not his accomplishments (too intimidating) or his spiritual journey (too Mormon), or the odd incidents of his life (he was once declared dead after a traffic accident).
 His stump speech features generic Republican lines that could be uttered by any candidate at any time, almost as if they were originally designed for someone else and implanted onto him. He recently got into a more-anti-abortion-that-thou fight with Sam Brownback.
 Maybe this market-tested, generic approach is working. Romney is ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire and tomorrow he is going to win the Iowa straw poll, though probably by less than some think. 
 Yet the campaign ill-fits the man. His audiences are impressed, but often unfulfilled.
 In interviews, Romney talks easily about books by Fareed Zakaria and Rory Stewart, but in public his frame of cultural reference is mostly limited to songs like ''Whistle While You Work.'' (Why do the Democratic candidates pretend to be smarter than they really are, while the Republicans pretend to be dumber?)
 He is also the world's worst culture warrior. George H. W. Bush's son could resent the coastal cultural elites, but George Romney's son just can't. He's a 1950s consensus man -- he asked his grandkids to call him Ike, after his hero -- who is play-acting at being Pat Buchanan. He's unable to do anger. I asked him recently who he hated, and he dodged the question.
 Finally, Romney's real passions seem sparked by issues he rarely gets to talk about. When I asked him why the G.O.P. is in such bad straits, he said it's because the party had ceded issues like the environment, education and health care to the Democrats. 
 Somehow the Romney campaign seems less like an authentic conservative campaign than an outsider's view of what a conservative campaign should be. It oversimplifies everything, and underexploits the G.O.P.'s vestigial longing for efficient administration. I suspect the Romney campaign would do even better if it let the real Mitt Romney out to play.

HEADLINE: MORTGAGE LOSSES ECHO IN EUROPE AND ON WALL ST.

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and MARK LANDLER; Vikas Bajaj reported from New York, and Mark Landler from Frankfurt. Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London; James Kanter from Paris; and Julie Creswell from New York.

 BODY:
Turmoil in the home loan market ricocheted from the United States to Europe and back again yesterday as stocks on Wall Street suffered their biggest one-day decline since February, reflecting growing concerns about tightening credit worldwide.
 Big losses on packages of American home loan securities sold to investors turned up unexpectedly in French and Dutch banks yesterday, adding to worries at hedge funds and financial institutions around the globe. With trillions of dollars of securities outstanding, those announcements raised expectations that more problems may soon emerge in other unlikely places as well. 
 The spreading fears forced the European Central Bank and, later, the Federal Reserve to inject billions of dollars into the financial system to help prevent borrowing and lending in credit markets from freezing up. 
 Japan's central bank followed suit, injecting more than $8 billion into money markets as stocks there plummeted Friday morning. Indexes fell more than 2 percent across Asia in early trading Friday, and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia Pacific index, a key regional index, was down 2.9 percent by midmorning in Tokyo. 
 In a statement that could further fuel the selloff, Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender, said after the United States market closed that the debt markets were ''experiencing unprecedented disruptions'' that could hurt its profits and financial health. The company said it planned to hold more loans on its own books because investors were not willing to buy them. But it noted that its capacity to do so was ''not unlimited.'' 
 Yesterday's sell-off started in France, after BNP Paribas, the largest publicly traded bank there, suspended investors' ability to remove money from three funds that had invested in American mortgage securities. The bank said it had become temporarily unable to place a value on the funds, which have turned sour as increasing numbers of homeowners have defaulted on their loans.
 ''Trust was shaken today,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. ''Credit depends on trust. If trust disappears, then credit disappears, and you have a systemic issue.''
 On Wall Street, where shares have been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell nearly 3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 387.18 points, or 2.8 percent. European markets were down somewhat less, but stocks in Latin America fell as much or more than they did in New York. Treasury prices edged up as investors sought the safety of holding government debt. 
 For the second consecutive day, President Bush sought to soothe investors by pointing out that the American job market and the global economy were healthy. He added that deep pools of capital were available.
 ''The fundamentals of our economy are strong,'' he said at a news conference. ''Another factor one has got to look at is the amount of liquidity in the system. And I am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct.''
 But his remarks appeared to have only a brief and limited impact on the stock market. Later in the day, several Democrats criticized the administration's response to the mortgage problems as weak and shortsighted.
 BNP became the latest European lender to announce problems linked to American home loans. Late last month, a group of German government-backed banks agreed to bail out a bank based in Dusseldorf, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, that invested in riskier American mortgage securities. And yesterday, in the Netherlands, NIBC Holdings reported that it lost at least $188 million on investments in the American mortgage market for subprime loans. Problems have also cropped up at hedge funds and banks in Australia.
 The spreading fallout and the difficulty of evaluating the value of mortgage securities has made banks and brokerage firms much more wary of lending to clients like hedge funds -- and yesterday even to each other.
 Citing ''tensions in the euro money market,'' the European Central Bank in Frankfurt lent more than $130 billion overnight at a rate of 4 percent to tamp down a surge in the rates banks charge each other for very short-term loans. The Federal Reserve injected $24 billion into the United States banking system to keep its benchmark overnight lending rate at 5.25 percent, after it opened this morning at 5.5 percent.
 While officials at the Fed have made it clear that they do not want to simply bail out investors who made unwise investments by quickly cutting interest rates, they are under growing pressure to act. In the futures market, traders went from predicting that an interest rate cut was unlikely next month to forecasting that it was all but certain by September. 
 It is common for central banks to step in to stabilize rates when banks are either pumping too much or too little money into the markets. What was unusual about yesterday's action was the size of the move in overnight lending rates and the speed with which the central banks acted to bring them under control.
 ''There is certainly a liquidity crisis in the financial system that the normal players themselves are having a little bit of difficulty working out,'' said Jane L. Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, a bond firm in Burlington, Vt. 
 But the European bank's extraordinary response -- its first since Sept. 12, 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington -- deepened investors' anxiety.
 ''The E.C.B. ignited a fear that there is something really bad going on that the markets don't yet know about,'' said Jacob de Tusch-Lec, a fund manager at Artemis Investment Management in London. ''It will take time until investors are sure that this is not the case.''
 In Washington, there were calls for a more direct effort to support the housing market. Democrats argued that the administration should raise limits on the investment activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big purchasers of mortgages created by the federal government.
 Daniel H. Mudd, the chief executive at Fannie Mae, said in an appearance on CNBC that his company was ''ready to start investing now,'' but added that it was ''not going to be the only savior out there.''
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush rebuffed the idea of letting Fannie and Freddie sidestep agreements both companies signed with their regulator to limit their portfolios while they address accounting problems. ''Congress needs to get them reformed, get them streamlined, get them focused, and then I will consider other options,'' he said.
 Christopher J. Dodd, the Democratic presidential candidate and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said: ''There is no reason why such reform is a necessary precondition to a modification of the cap that is done in a safe and sound manner.''
 The two huge government-sponsored home mortgage buyers have often divided Washington along partisan lines. Many Democrats view them as important players in advancing affordable housing. But they are looked at with greater skepticism by the Bush administration and some Republicans who argue that the two companies are so big that they could destabilize the financial markets if they stumble.
 The problems that are plaguing the mortgage market appear to be loosely connected to Fannie and Freddie, however. Most of the loans that are starting to go bad were made by lenders that emerged in the last 10 years with the help of financing from Wall Street.
 Banks and brokerage firms provided the money to both mortgage companies that made home loans and the hedge funds and other investors that bought securities backed by mortgages. Now as defaults on those loans are rising, trading in the securities that are underpinned by them has seized up.
 Hedge fund managers are being told by their lenders to pony up more money or collateral to back up their falling investments. And some rich individuals, pension funds and endowments that invested in hedge funds are clamoring to redeem their shares in the funds.
 ''It's like popcorn in a kettle,'' said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a hedge fund in New York. ''First you have one or two pops, then it turns into a cacophony. I think we are about halfway through.''
 Many experts say the nation's mortgage problems are likely to worsen in the coming months as hundreds of billions in adjustable-rate loans reset to higher rates in the next 12 to 18 months. At the end of March, nearly one in five subprime home loans were either past due or in foreclosure. 
 At BNP, the three funds with stakes in home mortgages had a combined value of 1.6 billion euros ($2.18 billion), a fraction of the 600 billion euros the bank has under management. A spokesman for the bank, Jonathan Mullen, said fund managers were obliged to halt redemptions, because they could not determine the price of securities. 
 ''We hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back,'' Mr. Mullen said.
 The most unnerving aspect of the current situation, analysts and policy makers acknowledge is not knowing how broad and deep the problems run and what kind of impact new revelations will have on the broader market for credit.
 ''It's impossible at this stage to judge how large and how persistent this tightening of credit conditions is likely to be,'' Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Wednesday. 
 Not everyone is running for the exits. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, sid much of yesterday's angst came from rumors about hedge funds in trouble.
 ''We remain of the view that issues of the market remain very much limited to a certain part of it,'' he said. 
 In the American stock market, the Dow average ended the day at 13,270.68, which is still up 6.5 percent for the year. It was the biggest one-day decline since the Dow lost 416.02 points on Feb. 27, another day when stocks sold off around the world.
 The S.& P. 500-stock index closed at 1,453.09 and is up 2.5 percent for the year. The Nasdaq composite index was down 2.2 percent for the day, to 2,556.49. Treasury prices were up, with the 10-year note rising 18/32, to 99 27/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.77 percent, from 4.85 percent Wednesday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 30-year bonds:

HEADLINE: MORTGAGE LOSSES ECHO IN EUROPE AND ON WALL ST.

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and MARK LANDLER; Vikas Bajaj reported from New York, and Mark Landler from Frankfurt. Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London; James Kanter from Paris; and Julie Creswell from New York.

 BODY:
Turmoil in the home loan market ricocheted from the United States to Europe and back again yesterday as stocks on Wall Street suffered their biggest one-day decline since February, reflecting growing concerns about tightening credit worldwide.
 Big losses on packages of American home loan securities sold to investors turned up unexpectedly in French and Dutch banks yesterday, adding to worries at hedge funds and financial institutions around the globe. With trillions of dollars of securities outstanding, those announcements raised expectations that more problems may soon emerge in other unlikely places as well.
The spreading fears forced the European Central Bank and, later, the Federal Reserve to inject billions of dollars into the financial system to help prevent borrowing and lending in credit markets from freezing up. 
 Japan's central bank followed suit, injecting more than $8 billion into money markets as stocks there plummeted Friday morning. Indexes fell more than 2 percent across Asia in early trading Friday, and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia Pacific index, a key regional index, was down 2.9 percent by midmorning in Tokyo. 
 In a statement that could further fuel the selloff, Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender, said after the United States market closed that the debt markets were ''experiencing unprecedented disruptions'' that could hurt its profits and financial health. The company said it planned to hold more loans on its own books because investors were not willing to buy them. But it noted that its capacity to do so was ''not unlimited.'' 
 Yesterday's sell-off started in France, after BNP Paribas, the largest publicly traded bank there, suspended investors' ability to remove money from three funds that had invested in American mortgage securities. The bank said it had become temporarily unable to place a value on the funds, which have turned sour as increasing numbers of homeowners have defaulted on their loans.
 ''Trust was shaken today,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. ''Credit depends on trust. If trust disappears, then credit disappears, and you have a systemic issue.''
 On Wall Street, where shares have been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell nearly 3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 387.18 points, or 2.8 percent. European markets were down somewhat less, but stocks in Latin America fell as much or more than they did in New York. Treasury prices edged up as investors sought the safety of holding government debt. 
 For the second consecutive day, President Bush sought to soothe investors by pointing out that the American job market and the global economy were healthy. He added that deep pools of capital were available.
 ''The fundamentals of our economy are strong,'' he said at a news conference. ''Another factor one has got to look at is the amount of liquidity in the system. And I am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct.''
 But his remarks appeared to have only a brief and limited impact on the stock market. Later in the day, several Democrats criticized the administration's response to the mortgage problems as weak and shortsighted.
 BNP became the latest European lender to announce problems linked to American home loans. Late last month, a group of German government-backed banks agreed to bail out a bank based in Dusseldorf, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, that invested in riskier American mortgage securities. And yesterday, in the Netherlands, NIBC Holdings reported that it lost at least $188 million on investments in the American mortgage market for subprime loans. Problems have also cropped up at hedge funds and banks in Australia.
 The spreading fallout and the difficulty of evaluating the value of mortgage securities has made banks and brokerage firms much more wary of lending to clients like hedge funds -- and yesterday even to each other.
 Citing ''tensions in the euro money market,'' the European Central Bank in Frankfurt lent more than $130 billion overnight at a rate of 4 percent to tamp down a surge in the rates banks charge each other for very short-term loans. The Federal Reserve injected $24 billion into the United States banking system to keep its benchmark overnight lending rate at 5.25 percent, after it opened this morning at 5.5 percent.
 While officials at the Fed have made it clear that they do not want to simply bail out investors who made unwise investments by quickly cutting interest rates, they are under growing pressure to act. In the futures market, traders went from predicting that an interest rate cut was unlikely next month to forecasting that it was all but certain by September. 
 It is common for central banks to step in to stabilize rates when banks are either pumping too much or too little money into the markets. What was unusual about yesterday's action was the size of the move in overnight lending rates and the speed with which the central banks acted to bring them under control.
 ''There is certainly a liquidity crisis in the financial system that the normal players themselves are having a little bit of difficulty working out,'' said Jane L. Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, a bond firm in Burlington, Vt. 
 But the European bank's extraordinary response -- its first since Sept. 12, 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington -- deepened investors' anxiety.
 ''The E.C.B. ignited a fear that there is something really bad going on that the markets don't yet know about,'' said Jacob de Tusch-Lec, a fund manager at Artemis Investment Management in London. ''It will take time until investors are sure that this is not the case.''
 In Washington, there were calls for a more direct effort to support the housing market. Democrats argued that the administration should raise limits on the investment activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big purchasers of mortgages created by the federal government.
 Daniel H. Mudd, the chief executive at Fannie Mae, said in an appearance on CNBC that his company was ''ready to start investing now,'' but added that it was ''not going to be the only savior out there.''
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush rebuffed the idea of letting Fannie and Freddie sidestep agreements both companies signed with their regulator to limit their portfolios while they address accounting problems. ''Congress needs to get them reformed, get them streamlined, get them focused, and then I will consider other options,'' he said.
 Christopher J. Dodd, the Democratic presidential candidate and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said: ''There is no reason why such reform is a necessary precondition to a modification of the cap that is done in a safe and sound manner.''
 The two huge government-sponsored home mortgage buyers have often divided Washington along partisan lines. Many Democrats view them as important players in advancing affordable housing. But they are looked at with greater skepticism by the Bush administration and some Republicans who argue that the two companies are so big that they could destabilize the financial markets if they stumble.
 The problems that are plaguing the mortgage market appear to be loosely connected to Fannie and Freddie, however. Most of the loans that are starting to go bad were made by lenders that emerged in the last 10 years with the help of financing from Wall Street.
 Banks and brokerage firms provided the money to both mortgage companies that made home loans and the hedge funds and other investors that bought securities backed by mortgages. Now as defaults on those loans are rising, trading in the securities that are underpinned by them has seized up.
 Hedge fund managers are being told by their lenders to pony up more money or collateral to back up their falling investments. And some rich individuals, pension funds and endowments that invested in hedge funds are clamoring to redeem their shares in the funds.
 ''It's like popcorn in a kettle,'' said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a hedge fund in New York. ''First you have one or two pops, then it turns into a cacophony. I think we are about halfway through.''
 Many experts say the nation's mortgage problems are likely to worsen in the coming months as hundreds of billions in adjustable-rate loans reset to higher rates in the next 12 to 18 months. At the end of March, nearly one in five subprime home loans were either past due or in foreclosure. 
 At BNP, the three funds with stakes in home mortgages had a combined value of 1.6 billion euros ($2.18 billion), a fraction of the 600 billion euros the bank has under management. A spokesman for the bank, Jonathan Mullen, said fund managers were obliged to halt redemptions, because they could not determine the price of securities. 
 ''We hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back,'' Mr. Mullen said.
 The most unnerving aspect of the current situation, analysts and policy makers acknowledge is not knowing how broad and deep the problems run and what kind of impact new revelations will have on the broader market for credit.
 ''It's impossible at this stage to judge how large and how persistent this tightening of credit conditions is likely to be,'' Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Wednesday. 
 Not everyone is running for the exits. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, sid much of yesterday's angst came from rumors about hedge funds in trouble.
 ''We remain of the view that issues of the market remain very much limited to a certain part of it,'' he said. 
 In the American stock market, the Dow average ended the day at 13,270.68, which is still up 6.5 percent for the year. It was the biggest one-day decline since the Dow lost 416.02 points on Feb. 27, another day when stocks sold off around the world.
 The S.& P. 500-stock index closed at 1,453.09 and is up 2.5 percent for the year. The Nasdaq composite index was down 2.2 percent for the day, to 2,556.49. Treasury prices were up, with the 10-year note rising 18/32, to 99 27/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.77 percent, from 4.85 percent Wednesday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 30-year bonds:

HEADLINE: Retailers Report Disappointing Sales Figures for July

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The sluggish sales that have dogged the nation's retailers this year are a result of two quite different sets of problems. Consumers are cautious: they are paying more for gasoline and watching their home values fall. And the stores just do not seem to have the merchandise that people want to buy.
 As retailers reported generally disappointing July sales results yesterday, it was clear that the weakening housing market and more expensive gas had shoppers limiting their trips to the mall. When they did go, they bought tentatively, following a pattern that began in February. 
 But analysts say stores cannot blame economic conditions for all their problems. Even retailers catering to teenagers, like Pacific Sunwear of California and Wet Seal, which tend to be least vulnerable to the whims of the economy, had a bad month. That suggests to analysts that stores are not serving up the most exciting products.
 ''There is a big middle that is treading water, trying to figure out what their consumers are looking for,'' said Trish Walker, partner in the retail practice at the consulting firm Accenture. 
 John D. Morris, managing director of Wachovia Securities, agreed, noting ''a lot of fall trends are extensions of what worked in the spring and summer.''
 According to the International Council of Shopping Centers-UBS preliminary tally of 48 stores, July results were up 2.6 percent, compared with the 3.9 percent gain in the year-ago period. The tally is based on same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, which are considered a prime barometer of a retailer's health.
 The picture was made more complicated because of quirks in the retail calendar. Sales for the first week of August, a key back-to-school week, were reported in the July period, which helped raise July figures but should reduce business for August. And results were depressed by a shift in a tax-free sales week to August in two critical states, Florida and Texas, which analysts say helped delay shopping.
 Wal-Mart Stores said its profit margins were being squeezed by heavy discounting. Wal-Mart posted a 1.9 percent same-store sales gain, beating the 1.5 percent estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
 Same-store sales at a rival, Target, rose 6.1 percent, above the 5.9 percent forecast.
 Costco Wholesale reported a 7 percent increase in same-store sales, exceeding the 5.5 percent estimate, while J. C. Penney posted a robust 10.8 percent gain in its department store business, above the 9.8 percent forecast.
 Nordstrom reported that same-store sales rose 9.4 percent as the well-heeled customer continues to splurge. The results beat the 4.2 percent estimate.
 Macy's 1.4 percent decline in same-store sales for the month was in line with the 1.5 percent analysts expected. Gap Inc. fell short of expectations, posting a 7.0 percent decline in same-store sales. Analysts forecast a 4.9 percent drop.
 Talbots issued only a second-quarter same-store sales report, which showed a 4.8 percent decline, prompting the retailer to say it would record a loss instead of a profit for the period.
 In the teenage sector, Abercrombie & Fitch's same-store sales fell 4 percent, worse than the 0.7 percent expected. At American Eagle Outfitters, the drop was 6 percent; analysts expected a 2.9 percent increase.
 Wet Seal suffered a 7.2 percent decline, worse than the 5.0 percent projection. Pacific Sunwear had a 4.6 percent slide; analysts expected a 3.2 percent gain.

HEADLINE: For Missouri, Stem Cell Act Changes Little

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
When Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment last November protecting human embryonic stem cell research, it was viewed as a key endorsement of the research even in states with deep religious roots and strong antiabortion forces like this one.
 But the expected expansion of stem cell research in Missouri has since run into political and financial roadblocks, putting the future of the research in doubt. 
 State lawmakers who opposed the constitutional amendment continue to fight it, introducing new bills that would bar some types of the research and suggesting that a ballot initiative to that end may lie ahead. 
 Although the legislative efforts have so far failed, the uncertainty has made it difficult for facilities to attract stem cell specialists, some of whom question the state's commitment to research that supporters say could lead to treatments for diseases like Parkinson's and cancer. 
 In June, a private facility in Kansas City, the Stowers Institute for Medical Research, suspended plans for a $300 million expansion, citing the ''persistent negative political climate'' toward embryonic stem cell research. 
 The founders of the institute, Jim and Virginia Stowers, had contributed $30 million to the campaign to pass the constitutional amendment.
 Kevin C. Eggan, an assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University who works with stem cells, said he had strongly considered moving to Stowers, but had delayed his plans. 
 ''Everybody hoped that Missouri was going to be a good test case,'' Mr. Eggan said. ''It was exciting to us that stem cell research was being voted in in a state which has very restrictive abortion laws. But it has turned out to be a big disappointment.''
 A few months ago, the University of Missouri, in Columbia, lost some $85 million in state money for a new research facility. University officials said the facility was not intended for stem cell research, but opponents of the research blocked the financing anyway, suggesting that the constitutional amendment would make it possible down the road. 
 ''For a bright shining moment in time, we were moving ahead as a state to protect research,'' said Senator Chuck Graham, Democrat of Columbia. ''But now the other side wants to walk away, not only from stem cell research, but all research. Their attitude now is, if there's a beaker or a Petri dish involved, we're not going to fund it.''
 Representative Jim Lembke, a St. Louis Republican who said he opposed the destruction of human embryos, is among those who have proposed new legislation outlawing some elements of the research. 
 ''As people are educated about this issue, they come around,'' Mr. Lembke said.
 The ballot measure that passed last fall guarantees that any federally allowed stem cell research or treatment will also be allowed in Missouri. 
 The question of embryonic stem cell research has usually been fought out in state legislatures, not among voters, but supporters said the Missouri legislature's efforts to ban the research had led them to seek the statewide vote. 
 Only in California had voters approved a comparable measure, and Missouri was seen as offering a picture of how a more socially conservative state might respond. California's measure was approved in 2004 and included $3 billion in financing for stem cell research. Missouri's measure included no money.
 Other factors made the Missouri vote of special importance. It became a central issue in a race here that would help decide the balance of power in the United States Senate -- between Senator Jim Talent, the Republican incumbent, who opposed the amendment, and Claire McCaskill, his Democratic challenger, who supported it and ultimately won. 
 Though the amendment passed, the margin of 51 percent to 49 percent, a difference of 50,800 votes (out of about 2.1 million cast), was slimmer than some had predicted. It was rejected in 97 of the state's 114 counties, secretary of state records show, gaining most of its support in the metropolitan areas of St. Louis and Kansas City. 
 Supporters of the amendment outspent opponents by a wide margin. Within hours of the vote, opponents said they would fight on, focusing their attention narrowly on one element of the research, known as therapeutic cloning or somatic cell nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus of a mature cell is transplanted into an egg cell, which would then produce stem cells. 
 The debate has come down to a fight over what constitutes ''cloning.'' 
 Supporters of the amendment say they banned human cloning, which they defined in the amendment as an act that could result in a woman's pregnancy and the creation of a human fetus inside a woman's uterus. Opponents say the replication of cells, regardless of implantation in the uterus, amounts to cloning. 
 ''We think it's a false distinction to say that a clone exists only based on geography,'' said Pam Fichter, the president of Missouri Right to Life. ''Look, we support ethical stem cell research, and we think cloning was misrepresented to voters. We know that a majority of Missourians oppose cloning.''
 Donn Rubin, chairman of the Missouri Coalition for Lifesaving Cures, which led efforts to pass the amendment, said that reproductive cloning was what the public worried about. 
 ''What we protect is a very promising form of medical research that involves cells in a lab dish, not something that involves pregnancy,'' Mr. Rubin said. 
 Some scientists and academics said they had hoped that the amendment might make Missouri a new center of embryonic stem cell research, giving the state an economic boost. Instead, it may be sending forth precisely the opposite message: that the state, despite its pioneering ballot measure, has yet to figure out where it stands on stem cell research. 
 Mr. Lembke's measure failed to reach the floor of the State House this spring, but the intended outcome of the research amendment has been delayed by actions like the blocking of the research building at the University of Missouri. 
 ''Any time you have these kinds of debates, it has a statewide impact,'' said Dr. Gordon H. Lamb, the university's interim president. ''It also has an impact on people who look at the state as a whole from the outside.''
 Jaci Winship, the executive director of Missourians Against Human Cloning, said her group was weighing the possibility of a new initiative, perhaps as soon as next year. Members of Missouri Right to Life have been gathering names and contributions for such an effort. 
 Mr. Rubin's group, meanwhile, has continued raising money, bracing, he said, for another fight.

HEADLINE: As Credit Tightens, Investors Grow Wary of Bank's Reliance on Debt

BYLINE: By TIM JOHNSTON

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
Over the last few years, Macquarie Bank of Australia has become something of a role model for the investment industry, but in recent months, markets and investors have posed some difficult questions for the relative newcomer.
 Investors have wondered how the so-called Macquarie model, with its reliance on debt, would cope with higher interest rates and a market more wary of lending. The well-known short seller James Chanos has called the model inherently unstable.
 Macquarie was among the first financial institutions to recognize infrastructure investments as a long-term asset. Typically, the bank will acquire a long-term lease on a bridge, road, airport or power station, and then package the deal and sell it to one of the specialized funds that the bank manages. It then sells shares in the funds. Macquarie takes a cut at each stage. 
 The system seems to have worked well so far. Profits have grown to 1.46 billion Australian dollars ($1.25 billion) this year from 53 million Australian dollars in 1991. Profit in the first quarter this year was up 60 percent over the period a year earlier. From what was effectively a standing start in the early 1990s, Macquarie has grown to manage 35 funds, with more than 220 billion Australian dollars ($189 billion) in assets. 
 The bank is branching out, becoming increasingly active in the United States: the Dulles Greenway in Virginia, the Indiana Toll Road and the Skyway in Chicago all are part of its portfolio.
 But the Macquarie model involves large sums in debt, and as the subprime mortgage market has collapsed, investors have become more wary of debt in general.
 One of the bank's funds, Macquarie Fortress Investments, which invests in debt instruments, spooked the market recently when it warned investors that it had lost 4 percent of its value even though it had no direct exposure to subprime lending.
 The bank's share price has also had a roller-coaster ride, in May falling to almost 30 percent below its all-time high before recovering some ground.
 Ivor Ries, an analyst with E.L.& C. Baillieu, a brokerage firm in Melbourne, says the correction was expected.
 ''Macquarie was on a price-earnings ratio of 20 times when Wall Street was on 12,'' Mr. Ries said. ''The valuations got completely out of kilter with reality.''
 The problem with the Fortress fund was just the latest in a series of setbacks that have caused investors to question whether Macquarie's run might be coming to an end.
 This year, the bank played a crucial role in a consortium that tried to acquire Qantas Airways. The deal flamed out in a blaze of publicity, and Macquarie was caught in the backdraft.
 Mark Johnson, a co-founder of Macquarie Bank who was deputy chairman until his retirement this year, said that mistakes had been made in the bid for Qantas but that the bank had learned and would move on.
 ''There were lessons to be learned in handling politically exposed assets and assets where people have emotional attachment to the brand,'' he said.
 Mr. Johnson said that the uncertainty in the credit markets could cause some short-term problems but that a more rigorous credit environment could actually benefit Macquarie and its chief executive, Allan E. Moss.
 In his first interview since retiring, Mr. Johnson said the markets' new risk aversion would be reflected in lower prices paid to asset owners.
 ''There may be a slowdown in activity because sellers can't get the prices they expect, but they'll adjust to that fairly quickly,'' he said.
 Mr. Johnson said that he did not expect a long-term slowdown in deal making, adding that the bank is well equipped to take on the increasing competition in the infrastructure market.
 ''Macquarie is in areas they know and understand: it is mainly infrastructure, and there is an established track record and a depth of expertise,'' he said, adding that the bank is expanding into fields, like retirement homes and nursing homes, that have an investment profile similar to more traditional infrastructure assets.
 And, Mr. Ries said, there is no shortage of more traditional assets with conservative balance sheets still waiting to come to market.
 Mr. Johnson says that when compared with the bank's full-service competitors, Macquarie is in a relatively strong position.
 ''If there are tough credit conditions, they only apply in this one field,'' he said. ''Macquarie doesn't have any junk bond or debt underwriting exposure.''
 The bank says that because its model is to buy and hold assets, it is less susceptible to the vagaries of the market because it is unlikely to be forced to sell in an unfavorable climate.
 Most observers may expect Macquarie to ride out the short-term buffeting of the credit markets, but many are troubled by questions about the longer-term viability of the model itself.
 Mr. Chanos, of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates, has suggested that Macquarie is a sell. Mr. Chanos made his name betting against stock market monoliths like Enron.
 ''This only works in a world of cheap credit and asset inflation,'' he told a group of investors in May, adding that he sees the Macquarie model as an ''inherently unstable platform.''
 Many critics have highlighted the practice at some Macquarie funds of borrowing to pay dividends. The bank is aware of the concerns.
 ''The key question is cash, and you can be sufficiently certain of cash flows that you will be able to repay your debts as well as make distributions,'' said Mr. Johnson, who remains nonexecutive chairman of the huge Macquarie Infrastructure Group fund.
 Macquarie says that the average borrowing for the funds in its investment banking division, which includes the most prominent vehicles, is 58 percent of asset value.
 Part of the doubt arises from the complexity of the institutions Macquarie creates to hold assets. 
 ''It's driven by tax,'' Mr. Ries said. ''They create these convoluted structures to take all the free cash flow out of the business and give it to the owner of the asset.''
 Mr. Johnson says he is confident the Macquarie model will survive.
 ''In the foreseeable future, the sectors where Macquarie is competing are going to remain high-growth,'' he said, ''and there is so much liquidity in the world that it's hard to see generally favorable conditions changing in the next several years.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 15, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Friday about the investment strategy of Macquarie Bank of Australia misstated its recent profit growth. The bank's profit was up 60 percent in the fiscal year 2007, which ended in March, over the previous fiscal year -- not in the first quarter of 2007.

HEADLINE: Sonnets in Marble

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Reputation is the strangest thing. An artist is celebrated; he's on top of the world. He dies, and his work is forgotten, or misremembered, or misunderstood as fashions change and canons form. Then suddenly he's back in the spotlight, or what survives of him is, with scholars scrambling to make up for lost attention and time.
 This is the basic story of the 15th-century Florentine sculptor Desiderio da Settignano. He was a star in his day, and his name continues to hold a firm place in the history books. But the record of precisely what he did, and how and why, has grown dim since his death in 1464. He has had to wait almost 600 years for the career retrospective now at the National Gallery of Art. 
 The survey is minute: 28 pieces, only 15 of which can confidently be assigned to him. Picasso fills museums. Desiderio fits into two little rooms. True, his chief monuments -- a tabernacle in the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence and the tomb of Carlo Marsuppini in Santa Croce -- are absent because untransportable. But still, two little rooms. Better to get the catalog, you decide, and skip the trip. 
 Don't skip the trip. Traveling exhibitions of Renaissance sculpture are rare events. And ''Desiderio da Settignano: Sculptor of Renaissance Florence'' is proof that perfection cannot be quantified. It would be entirely true to Desiderio's spirit to think of the show as a sonnet -- a sonnetto, ''a little sound'' -- rather than an epic, an intimate study in precise rhythms, interior rhymes, energy concentrated rather than unfurled. And just as these qualities make their full effect when a sonnet is read aloud, so Desiderio's art, which is about light, touch and modesty of scale, makes most sense when seen live.
 He was born around 1429 in the village of Settignano, a short distance from Florence. He was from a family of stonemasons who supplied material for the city's sculpture workshops. His talent must have been apparent early; with an older brother, Geri, as mentor and partner, he opened a Florentine studio and it prospered. He married, had children and died in his 30s. The church in Florence where he was buried is gone, demolished in the 18th century. 
 That's pretty much what we know of his life. Legend had it that he studied with Donatello. But that sculptural pioneer was in Padua creating the altar ensemble for the church of St. Anthony during Desiderio's apprenticeship years. The two did work together later, and there's no question that Donatello influenced his younger colleague profoundly. And just by being there, he also cast an absorbent, obscuring shadow over his career. 
 One of the most familiar pieces in the Washington show, a marble relief of the Virgin and Child called ''The Turin Madonna,'' was long assumed to be by Donatello. Other Desiderio sculptures have been similarly misattributed. A main pretext for the exhibition -- organized by the Louvre, the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence, and in Washington by Nicholas Penny and Alison Luchs of the National Gallery -- is to give credit where credit was due.
 And just seeing a number of Desiderio pieces together is enough to suggest a difference of temperament between the two artists. Donatello was a powerhouse who thought on a grand programmatic scale, moved around restlessly and worked in broad strokes, leaving the finishing touches to others. He helped create the romantic model of the artist as hero. The Renaissance biographer Giorgio Vasari was a pushover for it; historians and critics still are. 
 Desiderio, by contrast, seems to have been an up-close, hands-on, stay-at-home craftsman. Even his biggest projects are made up of a thousand individual delicacies, which may help explain why his output was scant. Vasari acknowledged his technical precocity but recommended his art for charm rather than power. For him Desiderio's beauty was too beautiful. 
 To be fair, a visitor coming cold to the Washington show, which is made up of smallish reliefs and portraits, might feel the same. But this impression doesn't last.
 The reliefs, some so finely cut as to be all but invisible from a distance, represent Desiderio at his most virtuosic. Each is a slowly revealed tour de force. 
 In the so-called ''Foulc Madonna,'' the Virgin and Child emerge from the marble as if from some pliant, yeasty substance; the fingers of the Virgin's right hand are even half-immersed in it. The child's flesh swells against his tight swaddlings; the young mother's breasts push against her robe. Cherubs gather behind them, staring, their eyes blank, their mouths agape. The Virgin and Child have the same expression. They look serenely demented, high on this world of softness, with its cushiony heft and surface like silk.
 A panel, with a scene of St. Jerome at prayer in the wilderness, complicates this strangeness with narrative. The old man kneels before a crucifix in a kind of faceted canyon. In the background his pet lions chase a panicked intruder away. Then farther back, other things are happening, hard to make out. Although the panel is barely an inch thick, its planar recessions seem infinite, with Jerome himself, his face and raised arms deeply undercut, almost three-dimensional, a fleshly eruption in a spectral world.
 People were Desiderio's true subject; with them his eye for detail turned laser sharp. Yet the term ''portrait'' can be applied only loosely or tentatively to his bust-length sculptures. It is all but impossible to know at a glance whether they are secular or religious, images of citizens, historical figures or saints.
 A painted wooden bust attributed to him and known as ''La Belle Florentine'' was once assumed to be a somnolent Tuscan beauty. But an inscription uncovered by a recent cleaning revealed her intended identity: She is St. Constance, virgin-martyr. 
 A distinguished-looking elder in a profile relief is probably meant to represent Julius Caesar, though he fits no classical type. His face is as closely observed as that of a family member. The skin beneath his jaw sags; his sunken lips hint at missing teeth; you can sense the pulse flutter in his neck. He is both real and ideal. When was the last major New York museum survey of images of aging in art? It's a great theme (and possibly box-office poison). Desiderio's emperor would make a noble centerpiece.
 His most varied and distinctive portraits, though, are of children. The earliest here is a profile relief called ''The Young St. John the Baptist.'' It depicts a boy, maybe 11 or 12, with narrow shoulders and unruly hair, and that spacey Desiderio stare. His facial features, and by implication his character, are still not fully formed. Yet already he looks exhausted, a baby prophet stunned by adult knowledge.
 Even more expressive are the free-standing busts of toddlers, especially the one called ''Laughing Boy.'' Slightly smaller than life-size, it catches a child in a moment of open-mouthed glee. We can only guess whether this is truly a portrait -- of one of the artist's children, say -- or a generic likeness, or an image with religious implications. We do know that in it the sculptor created a model from which other artists would borrow. 
 Among them was the Italian modernist sculptor Medardo Rosso (1858-1928). He too made busts of children, the earliest being portraits of street urchins; the human form, smaller than life-size, was at the center of his art. His preferred medium, wax, has the uncanny softness and sensuality of marble. His forms depend on subtleties of illumination and shifts of observational position for visibility; you have to be there. As with Desiderio, Medardo's place in history has been cast in shadow by the presence of a heroically scaled contemporary, Auguste Rodin.
 In essential ways Desiderio and Medardo traveled in opposite directions: the Renaissance sculptor from religion to realism, the modernist from realism to a spiritualized abstraction. But both were alike in being sonneteers, poets who understood that a sonnet is not a mere sound or song but an explosive device, a compressed drama that starts with a specific image, ignites a complex emotion and opens a universe of feelings and ideas. 
 In the years Rodin was casting the Gates of Hell, Medardo was making tabletop portraits of his elderly landlady, turning her into an ingot of light. While Donatello was scaling heaven with his majestic church projects, Desiderio was whipping out toys from his apron pocket to make a kid shriek with delight. We know which of these artists have the great reputations, and their status is not likely to change. But which had the greater ambitions? Let's leave the question mark there.
 ''Desiderio da Settignano: Sculptor of Renaissance Florence'' continues through Oct. 8 at the National Gallery of Art, Fourth Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov.

HEADLINE: Bush Speaks Against Rise In Gas Tax to Help Bridges

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
President Bush spoke out Thursday against increasing the gasoline tax, an idea being discussed as a potential part of a new Congressional plan to shore up the nation's bridges after the deadly collapse in Minneapolis.
 In his last major news conference before his summer vacation, Mr. Bush also criticized Democrats in Congress more generally, questioning their priorities and motives on topics like economic policy and their perjury accusations against Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales.
 Asked about the gasoline proposal, which could amount to an increase of 5 cents a gallon under schemes floating around Congress, Mr. Bush said, ''Before we raise taxes, which could affect economic growth, I would strongly urge the Congress to examine how they set priorities.'' 
 The comments prompted angry volleys from Democrats, underscoring how sour relations have become between Mr. Bush and the Congressional Democrats as both take a summer break seven months after promising to work together.
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, said he would use reports that the nation's bridges were in overall disrepair to insist that the president match emergency spending on Iraq with emergency spending on bridges. 
 Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, suggested this week that a tax increase might be needed to finance a proposed trust fund to repair bridges in the Federal Highway System, A large percentage of the bridges have been identified as having structural problems. 
 Mr. Oberstar raised the possibility of a temporary 5-cent-a-gallon tax. The idea has some bipartisan support.
 Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska and former chairman of the transportation panel, said he could possibly support such a tax. Mr. Young has previously voiced support for increasing the gasoline tax.
 Mr. Bush, relaxed and primed for his vacation, scolded Congress for what he called its poor management of transportation financing.
 In a nod to using earmarks to pay for transportation projects like the one supposed to pay for the ''bridge to nowhere'' in Alaska, Mr. Bush said:
 ''From my perspective, the way it seems to have worked is that each member on that committee gets to set his or her own priority first, and then whatever is left over is spent through a funding formula. That's not the right way to prioritize the people's money.''
 Mr. Bush aimed most of his criticism at the Democrats. He said he wished that the Democratic-controlled Congress ''would become more prone to deliver pieces of legislation that matter, as opposed to being the investigative body.'' 
 ''I mean,'' he added, ''there have been over 600 different hearings, and yet they're struggling with getting appropriations bills to my desk.''
 Congress's progress on appropriations is slightly ahead of where it was a year ago, when Congress was in Republican hands and passed into law 2 of the 11 major spending bills.
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, issued a statement criticizing Mr. Bush's agenda.
 ''Whether it is privatizing Social Security, giving massive tax breaks to oil companies while consumers pay more at the pump or letting Osama bin Laden roam free while we keep our troops mired in an open-ended Iraqi civil war, America has had just about enough of President Bush's misguided priorities,'' Mr. Reid said.
 The exchange between Mr. Bush and the Democrats augurs more fighting when they return from their vacations and when they will likely wrangle over Iraq and the d increase in troop levels as part of a ''surge'' strategy. 
 The president also faced questions at his news conference on the lack of visible progress in Iraq toward the political reconciliation that the strategy intends to foster.
 ''There is a lot of work left to be done, don't get me wrong,'' Mr. Bush said. ''If one were to look hard, they could find indications that -- more than indications -- facts that show the government is learning how to function.''
 The news conference was held hours after Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq had met Iranian leaders in Tehran, including President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Mr. Maliki was shown in news reports holding hands and smiling with Mr. Ahmadinejad. 
 Mr. Bush dismissed the friendly imagery. ''Generally, the way these things work is you try to be cordial to the person you're with,'' he said. ''And so you don't want the picture to be kind of, you know, duking it out,'' he said while shadowboxing, '' 'O.K., put up your dukes.' That's an old boxing expression.'' 
 Mr. Bush questioned Iranian reports that Mr. Maliki had thanked Mr. Ahmadinejad for Iran's ''positive and constructive'' role in Iraq and said he awaited Mr. Maliki's report. 
 ''Now if the signal is that Iran is constructive,'' the president said, ''I will have to have a heart to heart with my friend the prime minister, because I don't believe they are constructive.''
 United States military officials said this week that attacks on American-led forces using a lethal roadside bomb said to be supplied by Iran set a record last month. Mr. Bush said he was confident that Mr. Maliki, an Iraqi Shiite who was in exile in Iran while Saddam Hussein led Iraq, shared his view that Iran has had a destabilizing role in Iraq.

PERSON: Frank D. Rich Jr. 

HEADLINE: Frank D. Rich Jr., 83, Real Estate Developer

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Frank D. Rich Jr., the chairman and former president of the real estate development company that led the transformation of downtown Stamford, Conn., from a deteriorating factory and retail district to a sleek office and commercial center, died on Tuesday at his home in Darien. He was 83.
 The death was confirmed by his son Frank Rich III. 
 Mr. Rich was president of the F. D. Rich Company in the 1960s when the Stamford Urban Redevelopment Commission chose it as the sole redeveloper of a 118-acre swath of the downtown area, dotted with rundown row houses and wood-frame homes. 
 ''It was like so many other New England cities: old and tired and based on manufacturing,'' Stamford's mayor, Dannel P. Malloy, said in an interview yesterday. ''There were large pockets of poverty, substandard construction of buildings.'' And the furniture factories and meat-packing plants were going out of business.
 By 1985, however, a New York Times article on the city's resurgence said: ''Stamford's old downtown has been not so much gentrified as eliminated. In its place has come an injection of high-rise energy in the midst of Fairfield County's otherwise placid suburban landscape.'' 
 Mayor Malloy said, ''The urban redevelopment movement in the '60s and '70s was renowned for its failures, but in Stamford, it was an amazing success, and the Rich company deserves a very large part of the credit for that.''
 The company was founded in 1921 by Mr. Rich's father, F. D. Rich Sr., a stonemason who had emigrated from Italy. For years it was primarily a construction contractor. But under the leadership of Frank Rich Jr., his brother Robert and their chief counsel, Lawrence Gochberg, the Rich Company won the city's urban renewal contract, with federal grants that eventually reached $100 million.
 In all, the company developed about five million square feet of new space, including three million square feet for corporate offices; the 850,000-square-foot shopping center called the Stamford Town Center, the 500-unit Stamford Marriott Hotel; three silo-like apartment buildings called St. Johns Towers; and Landmark Square, a complex of six office buildings, one of which, at 21 stories, is the tallest building in the city. Mr. Rich hired prominent architects, including Cesar Pelli, Hugh Stubbins and Moshe Safdie, to design the brick, steel and glass buildings along the Long Island Sound shore that changed the city's skyline. 
 Frank Domenic Rich Jr. was born in Stamford on July 4, 1924. He served as a first lieutenant in the Marines in World War II, graduated from Princeton with a bachelor's degree in engineering, then joined the family business.
 In addition to his son Frank III, of New Canaan, and his brother Robert, of Stamford, Mr. Rich is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Jean Hopkins; four daughters, Laura Rowland of Darien; Susan Mailman of Stamford; Lisa Coats of Palm City, Fla.; and Robin Fulton of Hilton Head, S.C.; another son, Charles, of Suwanee, Ga.; and 13 grandchildren. 
 Mr. Rich was president of his company from 1961 to 1971 and its chairman since 1979. He also served on the boards of many civic and charitable organizations and was chairman of the Stamford Center for the Arts. 
 The Rich company's projects were not limited to Stamford. It built the Alaska Pavilion and the Jordanian Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair in Queens; federal office buildings in Toledo, Ohio, and Bismarck, N.D.; military airplane hangars and barracks throughout the country; and about 500 units of housing in Anchorage, Alaska, after an earthquake struck the city in 1964.

HEADLINE: Buffett Is Invested in Rodriguez

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Now that Barry Bonds has eclipsed Henry Aaron as No. 1 on the career home run list, baseball and its fans will watch with rapt interest in the next five or six seasons to see if Alex Rodriguez supplants Bonds. One of those fans is Warren E. Buffett, whose position in the financial world is similar to the one Rodriguez occupies in baseball.
 ''He's the man who's going to break Bonds's home run record someday,'' Buffett said Tuesday, hours before Bonds hit his record-setting 756th home run. 
 When asked about Bonds in a second telephone interview Wednesday, Buffett said without uttering the word steroids, ''The guy is an impressive player no matter how he got there, but I predict A-Rod breaks it and there will be joy in Mudville when it happens.''
 He added, ''I'm going to be 77 in a few weeks, and I hope I'm here when he breaks it.''
 Buffett lives in Omaha, the home of his Berkshire Hathaway holding company, the College World Series and the Kansas City Royals' Pacific Coast League affiliate, of which Buffett has been a quarter owner for 10 years. With a Forbes-estimated $52 billion personal worth, Buffett is considered the world's second-wealthiest person. 
 He has been a big baseball fan since he was 8 and his grandfather took him by train to Chicago from Omaha to see a game on May 17, 1939 between the Cubs and the Brooklyn Dodgers that ended in a 9-9 tie after 19 innings. In more recent years, Buffett has become a Rodriguez fan. 
 Given that Rodriguez, the Yankees' third baseman, is the highest-paid player in baseball history, there is sort of an economic link between them.
 ''A couple years ago, he got in touch with me and wanted to come in and talk,'' Buffett said. ''We hit it off very well.''
 In Toronto, Rodriguez explained his reason for contacting Buffett. ''I just always admired him as an American icon more than anything,'' Rodriguez said. ''I have so much respect for everything he's accomplished and how humble he's stayed despite all of his success.''
 Buffett recalled a more recent meeting with Rodriguez, who leads the majors in home runs and runs batted in this season. 
 ''I saw him earlier this year, and he told me how hard he had been working,'' Buffett said. ''I knew he was going to have a good season.''
 In December 2000, Rodriguez impressed another business magnate, Tom Hicks, the Texas Rangers' owner, who gave him a 10-year, $252 million contract.
 ''We actually insured him,'' Buffett said. ''We own some insurance companies, and they bought disability insurance on him. It was a big policy, so big that no one else would write it. I think it was a $260 million permanent disability policy.''
 Buffett's company, a Berkshire subsidiary, never had to pay on the policy. Rodriguez missed only one game in the three seasons he played for the Rangers.
 Buffett has long been viewed as an ideal person to own a team. He loves baseball, and he has the money to buy a team. 
 ''Up until the age of about 20, I probably did think if I got rich I would buy a baseball team,'' he said. ''Then I got rich, and I changed my mind.''
 Two groups have approached him about buying the Chicago Cubs, he said, and he recalled receiving a half-dozen calls about the Royals when they were available in the late 1990s. 
 ''If I was in a major league city, who knows?'' Buffett said. ''But the answer is no, I will not be buying a major league team.''
 Buffett also recalled advice he gave in the early 1990s to Bill Gates, who tops the Forbes list. The Nintendo people were buying the Seattle Mariners, and they were seeking investors.
 ''Bill Gates asked me if he should buy into it,'' Buffett said. ''I said: 'If you love baseball, buy it. But if you buy and you don't win every year, you'll be a bum.' ''
 Gates did not buy.
 It was not long ago that doomsayers were predicting that the price of franchises would plummet. 
 Even Commissioner Bud Selig said the only reason prospective owners might be found was ''the greater fool'' theory. Baseball, however, has flourished in recent years.
 Asked about baseball as an investment, Buffett said: ''If you buy teams at present prices, you will not do well, in my view, in terms of the actual income that will result from that ownership compared with the price you pay. But as the super-rich get richer and there are a limited number of teams, they love the sport, and just like they buy paintings, there will be more of those people who buy teams.''
 Buffett, meanwhile, will be content with his baseball artifacts.
 ''I have an A-Rod Yankee uniform on my wall and a bunch of baseballs,'' he said. 
 Also hanging on a wall are illustrations from the Ted Williams book ''The Science of Hitting.''
 ''The most important thing in investing,'' Buffett said, ''is what Williams said was the most important thing in hitting'' -- waiting for the right pitch. 
 ''What's nice about investing is you don't have to swing at pitches,'' Buffett said. ''You can watch pitches come in one inch above or one inch below your navel, and you don't have to swing. No umpire is going to call you out. You can wait for the pitch you want.''

HEADLINE: China Trade Surplus Surged in July, Defying Expectations for an Easing

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
China's trade surplus soared 67 percent in July from a year ago to its second-highest monthly level on record, according to data reported Friday.
 The July surplus totaled $24.4 billion, the Chinese customs agency reported. That beat every previous month except the record of $26.9 billion in June. 
 Analysts had expected the surplus to ease in July after exporters rushed to ship goods in earlier months to beat changes in tax policy meant to narrow China's yawning trade gap.
 The surplus grew despite recalls and warnings about faulty or tainted Chinese goods including toys, toothpaste, tires and seafood in the United States and other countries.
 The United States and other trading partners are pressing Beijing to ease currency controls and barriers to imports. Some American lawmakers want penalties on China if it does not ease controls on its currency, the yuan, which critics say is undervalued and gives Chinese exporters an unfair price advantage.
 The Senate is considering two measures to penalize China for its currency controls.
 Senate panels approved them over the protests of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who is conducting a long-running ''strategic economic dialogue'' with Beijing over trade and other disputes and says punitive legislation would disrupt that process.
 The July figure raised China's total trade surplus for the first seven months of this year to $136.8 billion, the General Administration of Customs said on its Web site.
 July exports surged 34.2 percent, to $107.7 billion, while imports rose more slowly, expanding 26.9 percent, to $83.4 billion, the agency said.
 China's trade surplus with the United States was $14.4 billion in July. Exports rose 18 percent, to $20.4 billion, while imports of American goods rose 15.8 percent, to $6 billion, the agency said.
 China's total surplus with the United States stands at $88.3 billion for the first seven months of the year, according to the government's figures. Beijing often reports a much smaller figure than Washington for China's trade gap with the United States.
 The United States reported a trade deficit of $232.5 billion with China last year, its biggest ever with any country. This year's gap is expected to exceed that.

HEADLINE: Europeans Are Wondering About Subprime Exposure

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
As subprime market tremors in the United States spread to Europe, they are raising questions whether regulation and accounting rules on the Continent are forcing companies to disclose enough information to investors about their exposure to such high-risk assets.
 While regulators in the United States are reportedly examining financial statements of Wall Street securities firms to make sure they are not hiding subprime-related losses, regulators in Europe seem far less concerned. 
 A spokeswoman for the Financial Services Authority in Britain said on Friday that the agency was ''closely observing market developments and has a constant dialogue with firms'' but added that it did that regularly and there was no need to make further investigations. 
 In Italy, the stock market regulator is not particularly concerned, a spokesman said, because there is no subprime market in the country and the banks are not much exposed to the American market. 
 The Authorite des Marches Financiers in France is paying ''very close attention to the situation'' since BNP Paribas, the largest publicly traded bank there, suspended investors' ability to remove money from three funds that had invested in American mortgage securities. 
 ''We aim to ensure that there is equal treatment of investors,'' the agency said in a statement, ''and have sought assurances from banks that any suspension of funds will only be provisional.''
 The Spanish market watchdog, the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores, or CNMV, said that it could not comment Friday on whether it was examining any funds. 
 Repeated calls to the media office of the German financial market regulator, known as BaFin, were not answered. 
 In the absence of any inquiries by a European regulator or any reliable source providing a figure of how many subprime loans have been purchased by foreigners, investors are being left in the hands of the financial institutions.
 ''There is no comprehensive data which allows anybody to know how much Europeans have purchased,'' Gilles Moec of Bank of America in London said. ''It's a problem.''
 Most European banks and insurance companies have used their quarterly earnings reports to inform investors about their exposure to subprime loans but that did little to calm investors, especially after an episode last week involving IKBDeutsche Industriebank. 
 The German bank had disclosed deteriorating subprime investments and had to be bailed out by a government-backed group just days after the bank said it would not be affected by mortgage losses in the United States.
 German state prosecutors said Friday that they were investigating whether officials at IKB might have committed breach of trust or violated German securities law.
 Geoffrey Wood, a professor of economics at Cass Business School in London, said that European banks might have been more willing to take on risks because the tendency to bail out banks in trouble is stronger in Europe. 
 ''Under the U.S. regulatory system,'' he said, ''there is much less temptation to bail out banks.'' 
 Problems linked to American home loan securities have cropped up at several European banks this month, forcing them to either announce lower earnings or close funds temporarily to halt withdrawals. 
 Accounting rules in Europe are offering little help to investors trying to avoid companies indirectly or directly exposed to subprime loans. International Financial Accounting Standards, which are similar to those in the United States, started to apply in 2005 but since Europe lacks an overall financial regulator, not all countries have put the rules in place in the same manner, and enforcement varies.
 The accounting rules do help identify direct investments in subprime lending. But when it comes to assets held via a fund or indirectly through collateralized debt obligations, the system is less transparent. 
 Companies are obliged to disclose total assets under management and the revenue they generate from managing them, but additional information, for instance what the funds invest in, needs to be supplied only to the investors of those funds and not to shareholders. That is because such investments are ''off-balance sheet,'' meaning the risk of losses at an investment fund lies with its investors and not with the financial services firm that manages it.
 But the current liquidity crisis has begun to test the valuation methods of assets under management, some analysts said. ''When liquidity is disappearing, the valuations can change very quickly,'' said Iain Coke, head of the financial services faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in London. ''The challenge in the accounting is measuring the values of assets and liabilities under stress.'' 
 Any disclosures required by current accounting standards would tell investors very little about what happens in their funds right now, he said, adding that ''maybe we need to look at those rules again.''
 Noticing a possible shortcoming of required disclosure, some European banks have started to go out of their way to provide information about any possible exposure to the subprime problems. On Friday, the KBC Group, Belgium's second-biggest financial services company, after Fortis, went so far as to run through some ''extreme stress tests'' with its portfolio as part of its earnings presentation. 
 ''In times when there is uncertainty and fear, disclosure is a good thing,'' said Andy Lynch, a fund manager at Schroder Investment Management in London.

HEADLINE: Central Banks Intervene To Calm Volatile Markets

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Wayne Arnold, Steve Weisman and Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Central banks around the world acted in unison yesterday to calm nervous financial markets by providing an infusion of cash to the system. But stocks still fell sharply in Asia and Europe, and in early trading in New York, before they recovered and closed essentially flat for the day on Wall Street.
 As in recent weeks, the markets moved in wild swings -- sharp drops were followed by steep gains and vice versa -- underscoring the uncertainty. Investors weighed concerns that losses in the American mortgage market would deepen and spread against their faith in the ability of a strong global economy to withstand additional shocks.
 Hoping to provide some comfort that there is ample cash available, the Federal Reserve made its largest intervention since the markets reopened Sept. 19, 2001, in the wake of the terrorist attacks. The central bank injected $38 billion into the financial system on top of the $24 billion it put in on Thursday. 
 The intervention steadied the markets -- at least for the day. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,453.64, a gain of 0.55 point, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 31.14 points, to 13,239.54. For the week, the Dow was up 0.4 percent, the S.& P. 500 rose 1.4 percent and the Nasdaq was up 1.3 percent.
 The question that remains is just how exposed the financial system and the economy are to losses in the credit markets and the increase in borrowing costs. The answer will set the agenda at the Federal Reserve, which finds itself confronting its first major financial crisis under the leadership of Ben S. Bernanke, who took over last year. 
 The Fed will be guided by its assessment of how much do banks, hedge funds, pension funds and others stand to lose and whether consumers and businesses will be able to stomach higher interest rates and stricter loan underwriting.
 ''There are a lot of risks in front of us,'' said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ''Financial crises, in the past, when not accompanied with a recession have been good for the markets.''
 But, she added, ''if the economic landscape deteriorates much from here, then we are going to have to suffer through a more difficult market period.''
 That debate, Ms. Sonders and others agree, will not be resolved anytime soon, which suggests that markets will remain choppy as information about failing hedge funds and mortgage companies dribbles out.
 Investor anxiety has been so heightened in recent weeks that days of stability have been shattered by the first sign of trouble tied to the debt markets. 
 Volatility, as measured by one popular index of options trading, has surged to its highest levels in more than four years, though it remains far lower than it was early this decade and in the late 1990s.
 The financial sector has been among the most volatile -- stocks there fell by as much as 1.7 percent during the day, only to climb as much as 1.1 percent before closing little changed. 
 Shares of Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender, and Washington Mutual, the sixth-biggest lender, opened sharply lower after both companies said they were facing a harder time selling loans and could potentially have problems raising money. 
 While those stocks recovered much of their losses for the day, they are both down significantly for the year. 
 A common pattern has been a surge in trading late in the afternoon, around 3 p.m., that has often sent stocks higher, as it did yesterday -- though on some days, like Thursday, the move has been just as sharp on the downside.
 Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Punk Ziegel & Company, noted the trend in a recent note to investors and suggested that the reason was strong buying from portfolios that use computer models to buy and sell quickly, a practice known as program trading, or a foreign source like the investment arm of the Chinese government.
 ''We are talking about such a sizable amount of buying and volume goes up and stocks react strongly one way or the other,'' Mr. Bove said. ''What I have trouble with is trying to figure out where it's coming from.''
 But he acknowledges that the pattern will probably not last long, because as sophisticated traders figure it out they will jump in on the other side to profit from the trades. 
 Using data from the New York Stock Exchange, Ms. Sonders of Charles Schwab estimates that program trading accounted for about 40 percent of all trades on the Big Board in recent days, up from the 30 percent range earlier this year. 
 ''That's why we are getting these swings, this is professional- to-professional trading,'' she said. ''This is money that has a time horizon measured in minutes.''
 Indeed, there is evidence that the average individual investor has not been a big player in recent days.
 Flows into mutual funds that specialize in American stocks were essentially flat for the week that ended on Wednesday, according to AMG Data Services. But investors put $36.2 billion into money market accounts, the largest weekly inflow this year. Investors often put cash into money market funds, which earn more than savings accounts, that they eventually plan to invest in the market. 
 It is not surprising that individuals are sitting on the sidelines, given the sharp moves in the market. Yesterday, for instance, all three major American indexes fell immediately after the opening bell, and at one point the Dow Jones industrial average was down 212 points. By noon, stocks were on the rebound and the indexes were briefly in positive territory, then declined. The Nasdaq finished at 2,544.89, down 11.60, or 0.4 percent.
 ''You can't invest into a market that does that,'' Mr. Bove said. ''You have a better chance at making money on the craps table than in this market.''
 Treasury prices were little changed yesterday. The 10-year note fell 9/32, to 99 18/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.81 percent, from 4.77 percent on Thursday.
 Earlier, stocks in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia dropped by more than 2.5 percent. The benchmark Kospi in South Korea fell 4.3 percent, the biggest decline since June 2004. Most major European indexes plunged by 3 percent or more. 
 In both Asia and Europe, fears about the American housing market prompted investors to sell assets and forced commercial banks to reel in credit lines.
 Central banks around the work stepped up efforts to slow the losses. The Bank of Japan added liquidity for the first time since the market problems began.
 The European Central Bank injected money into the system for a second day, adding another 61 billion euros ($84 billion), after providing 95 billion euros the day before. The Federal Reserve yesterday added $19 billion to the system through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities, then another $19 billion in three-day repurchase agreements.
 In Washington, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. spent the day in what his aides said was hourly contact with the Fed, other officials in the administration, finance ministries and regulators overseas and people on Wall Street -- where until last year he had worked as an executive at Goldman Sachs.
 ''We've been in touch with our colleagues in other agencies and among the financial regulators and are monitoring the situation carefully,'' said Michele Davis, the Treasury Department spokeswoman. ''Beyond that, we are not commenting.''
 As investors in Asia sold off assets considered relatively risky, like Philippine stocks, they bought those considered safer, like Japanese government bonds. Asian currencies like the Thai baht also retreated against the dollar and more liquid and stable currencies like the yen. 
 ''Everyone's been talking about a credit crunch, and not surprisingly it turned into one,'' said Jan Lambregts, head of Asia research at Rabobank. 
 While Asian banks did not seem to be directly affected, he said, ''the main problem is we don't know who is bearing the losses, and that kind of uncertainty is creating the situation that we're in right now.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 14, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about the Federal Reserve's decision to inject capital into the financial system mischaracterized the central bank's action. The Fed lent $19 billion against mortgage-backed securities, it did not purchase the securities. In a second action, the Fed lent $19 billion through reverse repurchase agreements.

HEADLINE: German Chief Felled by Scandal Returns to Market on Smaller Scale

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Heinz C. Schimmelbusch still keeps an apartment here, insisting he feels at home in a city where he was once the toast of the local elite and then, seemingly overnight, the villain in one of the most notorious corporate scandals of the 1990s in Germany.
 ''I am much less history-oriented than people in Frankfurt,'' Mr. Schimmelbusch, 63, said over coffee in the gilded lobby of the Frankfurter Hof hotel. ''I never think about the old days anymore.'' 
 In December 1993, Mr. Schimmelbusch, then seen as something of a wunderkind, was abruptly ousted as the chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, the metalworking conglomerate, after the company ran up $1.3 billion in losses on oil futures trading and nearly went bankrupt. 
 Now, after more than a decade in the United States, he has returned to Europe, raising 314 million euros ($433 million) last month in an initial public offering of his newest company, Advanced Metallurgical Group, on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam.
 The offering, which was heavily oversubscribed and sold just before the market turbulence set off by the home-lending crisis in the United States, could be regarded as a sort of redemption for Mr. Schimmelbusch.
 But the German corporate establishment has a long memory. Manager Magazin, the business publication that named him manager of the year in 1991, greeted his return to prominence with a lengthy, unflattering article in the current issue, under a headline that suggested he was little more than a trickster.
 ''There were some people here who were not fond of me,'' Mr. Schimmelbusch said. ''They are still here.''
 Regardless, he is back at the helm of a publicly traded company, albeit a smaller one than Metallgesellschaft. Advanced Metallurgical Group, which produces specialty metals like titanium alloys, has sales of $928 million. At its peak, Metallgesellschaft was a $15 billion empire, with 258 subsidiaries in businesses as diverse as copper, zinc and explosives.
 ''My life seems to be running backwards,'' Mr. Schimmelbusch said with a rueful laugh. ''Maybe if this company does well, a company like Metallgesellschaft might even offer me a job.''
 Mr. Schimmelbusch, who was born in Vienna to an Austrian-German family, began his career at Metallgesellschaft, also known as MG, in 1973. By 1989, at 44, he had become the youngest chief executive in its history. He set off on a shopping spree, turning MG into a colossus but leaving its core metals franchise vulnerable to cheaper imports from Eastern Europe.
 To offset that, Metallgesellschaft ventured into the oil business. Through its American subsidiary, MG Refining and Marketing, it sold fuel to customers on long-term fixed-price contracts, hedging its exposure to rising oil prices by buying contracts in the futures market. When prices fell instead of rising in 1993, MG was at risk for vast trading losses.
 Alarmed, Metallgesellschaft's largest shareholder, Deutsche Bank, pushed for Mr. Schimmelbusch's ouster and liquidated MG's positions, turning the paper losses into real ones. With investigators searching his Frankfurt home and his former employer threatening lawsuits, Mr. Schimmelbusch moved to a suburb of Philadelphia and tried to pick up the pieces.
 Some here see the MG debacle as a forerunner to the risky trading schemes that sank Enron. But experts in derivatives, notably the late Merton H. Miller, a Nobel-winning economist, argued that Deutsche Bank was to blame because it panicked.
 That defense helped salvage Mr. Schimmelbusch's reputation, especially in the United States, where he was raising money from investors for a private equity fund to get back into the metals industry. MG later settled a lawsuit against him, even helping to pay his legal fees.
 ''Usually, a person would never come back from that, but he is a fighter,'' said Norbert Quinkert, a board member at Mr. Schimmelbusch's company and the former head of Motorola in Germany.
 Working from his home base in Wayne, Pa., Mr. Schimmelbusch assembled a portfolio of holdings through his fund, Safeguard International, and a privately held company, the Allied Resource Corporation. Several of his managers are former colleagues from Metallgesellschaft.
 Advanced Metallurgical Group was ripe for a public listing, Mr. Schimmelbusch said, because it is in markets that have huge growth potential, like aerospace and solar energy. He said he chose to list the firm in Amsterdam rather than Frankfurt because of tax advantages.
 Last year, Mr. Schimmelbusch said, he had hoped to take public another of his companies, PFW Aerospace, in Germany. He put off the sale because of troubles at one of its customers, Airbus.
 ''It's hard to stand there and say, 'Gentlemen, this is a great business,' and then they go home and read in the paper about the A380,'' he said, referring to the troubled Airbus jumbo jet.
 Still, Mr. Schimmelbusch said he looked forward to returning to the Frankfurt market someday. He said he had repaired his ties with Deutsche Bank, with which he now does investment banking.
 He even recently acquired the Metallgesellschaft name, which was retired after a series of corporate overhauls. He said he had not decided what to do with it, although one can bet it will have something to do with metals. ''I'm a fully depreciated metals guy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Ignore the Last Few Weeks. It's Been a Heck of a 25 Years.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IT has not been the best few weeks ever for stock market investors, but it has been the best 25 years.
 As stock markets gyrated this week, the United States stock market was approaching the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the great bull market. The Dow Jones industrial average hit bottom on Aug. 12, 1982, at 776.92, during a recession and with interest rates very high. 
 The accompanying charts give views of just how good the intervening period has been, not only in American stocks but in those of Germany, Britain and Japan as well.
 The first chart shows the compound annual return of the Dow over 25-year periods from the period that ended at the end of 1925 up through the period that ended last month. One line shows the gain in the index measured in dollars, while the other shows the gain after adjusting for inflation. 
 The figures do not include dividends, which makes them lower than numbers often cited, but they also do not take into account taxes or the transaction costs involved in adjusting a portfolio of major stocks as the members of the Dow index change. They show how well such a portfolio has held its value relative to inflation during various periods.
 Over the long period of a quarter-century, there have been periods when stocks were poor stores of value. One such period ended in the summer of 1982, just as the bull market began. Over the previous quarter century, the value of the Dow, adjusted for inflation, had declined by more than 3 percent a year -- meaning that it had lost more than half its value.
 But as can be seen from the chart, in the next quarter-century the value zoomed. The compound return was 11.8 percent a year before considering inflation, a little below the record set in the 25-year period that ended in late 1999, just before the technology bubble burst and the market nosedived. But taking inflation into account, the 8.5 percent compound annual gain has been the best ever.
 The other charts show the total performance of indexes over the past quarter-century, from Aug. 12, 1982, for most of them and from July 31, 1982, for the FTSE All-Share index in Britain (daily prices are not available for the FTSE All-Share index that far back, so monthly figures were used, starting at the end of July 1982).
 The best of the lot is the German DAX index. In local currency, it has risen about the same as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the United States. But the German currency -- first the mark and now the euro -- has outpaced the dollar most of the time. In dollars, that index is up about 2,500 percent. 
 The performance of both the Nasdaq composite -- a star when the tech bubble was growing and a laggard thereafter -- and the Japanese Nikkei 225 provide ample evidence that what goes up can come down, and painfully so. At the end of the 1980s it looked as if nothing could match the Japanese index, and at the end of the 1990s the same could be said of the Nasdaq index. Both are now lower than they were when they were the stars.

HEADLINE: Oil Caused Prices of U.S. Imports To Top Expectations for July Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Prices of goods imported into the United States rose more than forecast in July on higher oil costs, highlighting Federal Reserve concerns that inflation may not subside.
 The 1.5 percent increase, the biggest since March, followed a revised 0.9 percent gain in June, the Labor Department reported Friday in Washington. Prices excluding petroleum rose 0.2 percent, the fifth consecutive increase, after climbing 0.1 percent in June. 
 Higher raw-material costs and a weaker dollar are pushing up prices for goods from all over the world, including China and Latin America. Rising prices from abroad make it more difficult for the Fed to lower rates if the economy stumbles after the global retreat in financial markets.
 ''There clearly are inflationary pressures in this report -- we see them both in energy and outside of energy,'' said Julia L. Coronado, a senior economist at Barclays Capital in New York. ''It highlights the balance the Fed is trying to strike'' in the middle of the market turmoil.
 Economists had forecast that import prices would rise 1 percent for a second month, according to the median of 51 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The forecasts were for a gain of 0.2 percent to 2.3 percent.
 The import-price index is the first of three monthly price gauges. The Labor Department's report on wholesale prices is due Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday. Economists forecast that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in July for a second month, according to a Bloomberg survey.
 Compared with a year earlier, prices of imported goods rose 2.8 percent in July after a 2 percent gain in June. Excluding petroleum, the increase was also 2.8 percent in the last 12 months.
 The price of imported petroleum jumped 7 percent in July, the most since March. Prices were up 4.1 percent from a year earlier.
 Food and beverage prices climbed 1.6 percent and were up 9.8 percent in the 12 months ended July, the biggest year-over-year gain since 1995.

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae's Offer to Help Ease Credit Squeeze Is Rejected, as Critics Complain of Opportunism

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest buyer of home loans, was blocked yesterday from expanding its mortgage holdings by 10 percent in what it called an effort to ease concerns about credit and shore up the struggling housing market.
 The regulator overseeing Fannie Mae, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, rejected the request, saying the company's principal market for mortgages was ''liquid and working.'' 
 After reports circulated all week that it would do so, Fannie formally announced yesterday that it was seeking permission to buy an extra $72 billion in mortgages for its portfolio. 
 ''Additional portfolio purchases would allow the company to bring much-needed liquidity to the housing segments that need it most urgently,'' Daniel H. Mudd, Fannie's chief executive, said in a statement.
 While Ofheo rejected the request, the regulator left open the possibility of changing its mind, saying it was keeping the matter under consideration.
 Ofheo acknowledged that there are ''credit and liquidity issues today'' in certain segments of the debt markets, but it said the mortgages experiencing the most difficulty were concentrated in the area of subprime, Alt-A and jumbo loans, issues ''outside the normal business'' of Fannie Mae. The company traditionally buys conventional loans made to borrowers with good credit records, known as conforming loans.
 In a four-page letter to Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, that it made public, the regulator also noted that both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, its smaller corporate cousin, remain ''significant supervisory concerns.'' Both companies are still getting their financial statements in order after Ofheo investigators found lax internal controls and accounting errors totaling $11.3 billion.
 Even with the Ofheo decision, Fannie Mae can still purchase mortgages and issue securities, guaranteeing that the underlying mortgages will not default. Those guarantees are still accepted by investors, but the government-sponsored enterprise is now brushing up against the legal limits on the loans it can hold. There is no cap, however, on the amount of loans that Fannie Mae can package into securities, ensuring that conventional mortgages will continue to be widely available to home buyers.
 Yesterday's public exchange followed a week of political maneuvering in Washington as Wall Street watched global markets swing wildly up and down. Investors are increasingly worried that problems in the subprime market are spreading to other areas of the economy, causing lenders to tighten up the easy money that let buyout firms snap up big companies and allowed millions of Americans to buy homes.
 Fannie Mae seized on those anxieties to make a case to federal regulators that raising its portfolio limits could ease tension in credit markets and help prop up the housing market. It lined up supporters that included longtime political allies, like Democratic lawmakers, as well as sometime rivals, like Wall Street banks that would benefit from its stepping in to buy more loans.
 But Fannie's critics, including many Republicans, argued that its motives were driven more by a desire to bolster its bottom line. They also bristled at the prospect that Fannie Mae could take advantage of the turmoil to be seen as a white knight.
 ''This is very much a buyer's market,'' said Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Arlington, Va., ''and they want to come in and take advantage of rock-bottom prices. They could buy very favorably or sell later. Politically, they are chafing under both the investment limitations proposed by Ofheo as well as the conforming loan limit.''
 Even President Bush weighed in. On Thursday, he said that both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac needed to complete a ''robust reform package'' before they expanded their mortgage portfolios. 
 The statement drew fire from many Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
 Christopher J. Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, called upon President Bush to ''immediately reconsider his ill-advised'' position as problems in the housing market worsen. 
 In an interview yesterday, Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said that the president's comments were ''inane.''
 ''Tell the Republicans to stop blocking the bill,'' Mr. Frank said. If the president ''is saying that 'I don't want to support any increase until we pass the reforms,' then you pass the bill and the bill takes care of that.''
 Mr. Frank, like many Democrats, argued that increasing Fannie Mae's mortgage portfolio was important because the government-sponsored enterprises could provide both liquidity to the market and were more willing to work out problem loans.
 But others suggested that the move would mainly help Fannie Mae's financial performance. 
 Josh Rosner, a managing director at Graham Fisher & Company, said that it was unclear whether Fannie would be using the portfolio to generate profits for shareholders by buying illiquid secondary market securities or help potential homeowners.
 ''Their spreads are still pretty tight. They don't need the portfolios to do business,'' Mr. Rosner said. ''They are one of the only places in the mortgage world that can actually securitize.'' 
 Besides, he said, it would be absurd to increase the size of their holdings until the extent of their exposure to subprime loans and other exotic mortgage products, like interest-only and negative-amortization loans, was better known.
 ''We don't know the true condition of their books, because they still aren't current in their filings; they still have internal- control weaknesses,'' Mr. Rosner said.
 ''They are sort of saying: raise our cap. Trust us. It wasn't too long ago, frankly a couple of years ago, that we had them say trust us only to find out they were untrustworthy.''

HEADLINE: A Desire to Feed the World and Inspire Self-Sufficiency

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
ROME 
 FITTING easily into the most conservative wing of the Bush administration, Josette Sheeran was from the outset an unlikely candidate to run the World Food Program, the world's largest humanitarian aid organization, which has frequently been at odds with Washington.
 She had already been appointed to senior roles in the government, with the A-list of connections common in that circle, from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Jack Kemp, the former New York congressman and free-market champion. But what made her more unusual was her long tenure as a major figure in the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church -- she left it in the late 1990s -- a conservative church that many Americans distrust.
 Facing questions about her background, Ms. Sheeran, now ensconced as the United Nations World Food Program's executive director, sighs in exasperation. She notes that in the past year she has served on a high-level advisory panel studying United Nations reorganization. She makes it plain that she is passionate about her new position. 
 ''When you come to the U.N. you know you're representing all countries, and when you see a hungry child you feel you represent all humanity,'' she said, working late on a Friday evening in her new office on the outskirts of Rome. ''That is a different perspective than representing a government, the U.S., and I understand that.'' 
 She said that her knowledge of the United Nations and her longstanding belief in ''empowering people'' to help themselves, rather than just handing out emergency food, is the right focus for the sprawling agency she inherited, and which she hopes to streamline. She refuses to discuss her affiliation with the Unification Church. ''My faith is a deeply personal matter,'' she said.
 She was appointed the World Food Program's executive director in November, having been nominated and aggressively promoted by the Bush administration over vociferous objections from the European Union. But it was not until April that she assumed her position at the agency, which feeds 90 million people worldwide.
 SINCE her arrival at the World Food Program, Ms. Sheeran has generally impressed staff members with her enthusiasm and grasp of the issues. But many within the agency were initially ''uncomfortable'' and ''nervous'' about her appointment, thinking that her background was a ''bad fit'' for the mission of the agency, said one staff member who has worked in many postings over two decades. The staff member and all those contacted in researching this article spoke on condition of anonymity because they would be working under Ms. Sheeran. 
 Many people favored Tony Banbury, an American who has had a long run with the group's Asia operations, the staff member said, adding: ''We know there's a lot of politics behind the appointment. We've worked with all types, so we're used to it.'' 
 The United States, as the largest donor, has traditionally exercised enormous influence on the selection of the group's director. But this time around, the European nations were dismayed enough by Ms. Sheeran's credentials that they tried to block the appointment. The European Union strongly favored a Swiss candidate, Walter Fust, a European diplomat said, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity. 
 Much of the antagonism centered on aid policy. The World Food Program and the United States State Department have long crossed swords over Washington's practice of donating surplus agricultural crops and requiring that they be shipped on American vessels and planes to the developing world -- all in an effort to promote American commerce. The agency prefers cash donations that can be used for food purchases locally, which is cheaper and helps local economies. The European Union is the World Food Program's second largest donor, and its donations are all in cash.
 After strong lobbying from the Bush administration, Ms. Sheeran's appointment was approved, the diplomat said.
 Ms. Sheeran says that she was picked in a ''rigorous process,'' and that she has been well prepared for the post. ''I made a case for my leadership to all stakeholders,'' she said. ''I think W.F.P. draws on so much of my background and many decades of thinking about how you break the cycle of poverty.''
 Ms. Sheeran is brimming with ideas about the terrain she has inherited, and she has been as good as her word on representing the poor, not just her government. She now says she ''would prefer cash'' donations to food aid, though, she adds, ''We will take anything that will help.''
 She plans to expand the agency's school-based meals for children, giving them food to take home for the evening as well. She is studying the impact that global warming and the diversion of crops to biofuels will have on the availability of food in the developing world. ''There could be challenging times ahead, and we want to have an effective toolbox ready,'' she said. 
 MS. SHEERAN was born in 1954 and educated at the University of Colorado. Shortly after college she joined the Unification Church, and was a powerful figure in the organization until she left, moving up the mastheads of newspapers owned by the church, and finally of the conservative Washington Times, one of its holdings.
 She spent more than a decade at the paper, eventually becoming its managing editor. During that time, she gained a large measure of recognition, serving as a Pulitzer Prize juror for foreign news in 1996 and chairwoman of the cartooning jury in 1997.
 But her tenure was not without its quirks. In April 1992, she became the first and only American journalist to interview the North Korean dictator, Kim Il-sung, whom she described as a ''reflective, confident elder statesman.'' At that moment, Mr. Kim's policies were propelling his country into a decade of famine, which ultimately killed at least half a million people. 
 Before she left the paper, she was named by Washingtonian magazine as one of the capital's 100 most powerful women. 
 She says she was inspired to a life of public service by her father, Jim Sheeran, a highly decorated World War II veteran and New Jersey state official who died in July. In particular, she recalls how her father, upon returning from the war, organized a food drive to assist the same European villages he had helped to liberate. When Ms. Sheeran was sworn in to recent government jobs, her father was unfailingly at her side. 
 But they did not always see eye to eye. A 1976 Time magazine article about distraught parents trying to deprogram children who had joined the Unification Church described Mr. Sheeran's efforts to ''rescue'' Josette, then 21, from a church-run school that he accused of ''cruel and exotic entrapment'' of ''minds, souls and bodies.''
 After leaving journalism, she became the head of Empower America, a Reagan-era conservative research organization that is dedicated to fighting poverty through free-market forces and individual responsibility. Later, she moved to the Bush administration, where she specialized in programs aimed at moving developing nations toward economic self-sufficiency. 
 ''This has been a passion of mine since I met Jack Kemp on a plane, about how economic policy ideas can have an impact in Harlem or in developing nations,'' she said.
 She said, for example, that her agency needed to fill the chasm between emergency food aid -- it feeds 2.1 million people a day in the Darfur region of Sudan, for example -- and long-term development. 
 ''Once we have a peace, that doesn't mean that grain is growing and roads exist for farmers to get crops to market,'' she said. ''We need to help people with returning to self-sufficiency, too.''

HEADLINE: Well-Traveled Photographer, Recording and Then Returning

BYLINE: By CAROLINE BROTHERS

DATELINE: ARLES, France 

 BODY:
Susan Meiselas is looking a bit shaken. She has just heard that her trip to Guinea, scheduled to start the next day, has been canceled; her driver there has been assaulted and is fleeing the country. She is working with Human Rights Watch photographing child domestic workers, and clearly someone didn't like it. 
 ''He was beaten by some combination of army and police and has to leave the country,'' she said. ''I was due to leave tomorrow on my way back there.'' 
 Her assignment was meant as a sequel to her photographs of Indonesian maids in Singapore last year. ''It's a strange thing to have your knapsack filled with film and cameras and be stopped on track,'' she said. 
 She was in this southern French city to help commemorate the 60th anniversary of Magnum, the photographers' agency she joined at 26. Some of her work, which covers a range that includes war in Nicaragua and sadomasochism in New York, is on display alongside that of her Magnum colleagues at the city's annual photographic festival, Les Rencontres d'Arles. 
 One of just 6 women among 52 active photographers at the agency, which was founded by Robert Capa, George Rodger, David Seymour and Henri Cartier-Bresson, Ms. Meiselas is known for her searing photographs of conflict. 
 She is also constantly questioning what photography can do as the technological and economic landscape that surrounds it radically shifts. 
 Ms. Meiselas's work was spotted by the Magnum photographer Gilles Peress in 1976. She had just completed her first in-depth project -- black-and-white shots of carnival strippers in New England -- and taken the pictures to Harper's magazine. 
 It declined to publish them but assigned her to photograph women at the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Peress, whom Ms. Meiselas met on that job, took her portfolio to Magnum, which invited her to join the same year. 
 Magnum at that time, she said, was ''a very potent place'' where photographers were being dispatched to faraway assignments. Being exposed to that gave her a new sense of her own possibilities as a photographer. 
 ''Before Magnum, I'm not sure I would have imagined myself going places I didn't belong,'' she said. Shortly afterward, she headed for Nicaragua and El Salvador, whose civil wars were to absorb her for more than a decade. 
 ''I was hard-core; it was hard to get me to leave that region,'' she said during a speech at the World Press Photo awards in Amsterdam in April. ''I didn't go to Peru or Haiti or South Africa, I just stayed in El Salvador.'' 
 They were formative years in several ways: remaining in one place over a long period made her conscious of the narrative structure of time, and in Nicaragua a sense of what she would try to do throughout her career as a photographer crystallized. 
 ''Staying in Nicaragua, I started to see pictures in the present as they would be perceived in the future as the past,'' she said. ''That was an incredibly powerful and important recognition for me. People were making history.'' 
 While a reporter can hear about and compress elements of an evolving situation into an article, the challenge for Ms. Meiselas was to become attuned to those fine shifts so as to capture them on film. But doing so also raised some hard issues and conferred a feeling of powerlessness with which she still seems to be grappling. 
 ''Part of what happens if you stay and take pictures is that you feel you will protect people just by standing there,'' she said. ''But you can't stand there that long, and you can't protect them.'' 
 Taking photographs, she once said in an interview with Nicaraguan television, ''is sometimes the least you can do.'' 
 Much of what drives Ms. Meiselas's work is a desire to step back through the looking glass to find the people she once photographed, to forge connections and return their pictures to them. 
 ''We take pictures away and we don't bring them back,'' she said. ''That became a central quest for me -- relinking, revisiting, the repatriation of work: it's become a kind of motif in my thinking.'' 
 The notion of moving in circles is now central to her work, but in a way, she has long been doing it. She laments the demise of the Polaroid camera because it allowed her to give a photograph, on the spot, to people who did not have cameras of their own. 
 In a project involving the Kurds, she sought to restore a collective memory to a dispossessed people, spending several years searching for photographs that were scanned into an online archive of Kurdish history, ''akaKurdistan'' (akakurdistan.com).
 Grappling with memories: that was her goal when she returned to Nicaragua in 2004 for the 25th anniversary of the Sandinista revolution. She took mural-size prints of some of her pictures and displayed them in the places where the shots had originally been taken.
 Her war photograph of a mauled body -- showing just a backbone in a pair of jeans -- was returned to a lonely hillside and erected there as a kind of memorial. Another work, which depicts graffiti scribbled on a pink wall, asking, ''Where is Norman Gonzales: the government has to answer,'' reaches beyond Nicaragua to recall all of Latin America's disappeared. 
 Ms. Meiselas of course has regrets: assignments that didn't materialize; not making it to Bosnia or Somalia. ''Doors open, and doors close, and they are not revolving ones always,'' she said. 
 Still, she has not shied from taking risks. Barred entry to the carnival strippers' tents, Ms. Meiselas befriended the strippers themselves until they invited her in; she was eventually persuaded to get up onstage in a raincoat and try it herself. ''I couldn't handle it,'' she said. 
 Years later she pushed herself to photograph Pandora's Box, a sadomasochism club in New York. ''It was the absolute edge of voyeurism,'' she said. ''I had to get right to that edge.''
 For her it was as much about violence as voyeurism; it recalled the interrogation cells of the wars she had covered, and the voluntary infliction of pain gave her nightmares. 
 ''To be in a small room with two people with an agreement that one of them imposes violence on the other -- it was so surprising how many people seek pain, who like to give it and get it, and I had to confront that,'' she said. ''I want to understand it. I need to be there to know.'' 
 An exhibition featuring her Pandora's Box photographs is at the Cohen Amador Gallery in Manhattan through Sept. 8.
 Ms. Meiselas's attempts to step back into the pictures she took decades ago seem not just a way of giving fragments of history back to its protagonists, but also something more personal: a way of understanding her own place in time. 
 ''I come out of a documentary tradition,'' she said. ''We all cross history, and whichever ones we cross shape us as we shape them.'' 
 She cannot yet say whether her photographs of domestic workers for Human Rights Watch will develop into another obsession. 
 ''They are very vulnerable, they are just very vulnerable,'' she said of the girls, some as young as 7, co-opted from Asia and Africa into the worldwide economy of caretaking. ''It's a sort of migration, and the thing that's startling is that they are not getting any education.'' 
 You have the feeling that she is standing there with her camera anyway, trying to protect them. 
 ''Magnum Photos'' is at the Magasin Electrique, S.N.C.F. rail yards, Arles, France, through Sept. 16. Susan Meiselas's photographs of Indonesian domestic workers can be viewed at Magnum in Motion, at magnumphotos.com. ''Susan Meiselas: Pandora's Box'' is at the Cohen Amador Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, Manhattan, through Sept. 8; (212) 759-6740.

HEADLINE: Design Spotlights Collision Of Engineering and Politics

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
There are oddities of the Pulaski Skyway that speak to issues as serious as its structural soundness and its place in engineering history. But others have more to do with the bare-knuckled politics of 1930s New Jersey. 
 Consider the Skyway's rapid and steep liftoffs in Jersey City and Newark. It climbs high above two rivers, which have seen few large ships over the years. Drivers are then sent down its narrow lanes to a steep dip in the middle. 
 Those undulations are the result of a political tug of war during its design, said Steven Hart, author of a book on the building of the Pulaski Skyway.
 Frederick Lavis, the engineer originally in charge of picking the best route, wanted to build the skyway with drawbridges just high enough that only the tallest ships in the rivers would require temporarily halting vehicular traffic, Mr. Hart said. 
 Mr. Lavis reasoned that most river traffic consisted of tugboats and low-slung barges, according to Mr. Hart's book. But the businesses along the river enlisted the War Department to demand that the bridge rise to 135 feet to accommodate vessels of any size. 
 Another power play pulled the bridge's midsection back to earth. Frank Hague, the mayor of Jersey City and one of the great political operators of his time, insisted that the bridge have an off-ramp in South Kearny to help the city's economic development, Mr. Hart said. 
 ''The skyway design is a classic example of engineering principles undone by politics,'' he added. 
 Mr. Lavis left the project before its completion, and noted his disappointment in an unpublished memoir, according to Mr. Hart's book.
 ''As soon as our backs were turned, the vultures swooped,'' Mr. Lavis wrote. ''The result was the 'Pulaski Skyway,' an ungainly and unlovely structure of steel.''

Lawn Boy
 By Gary Paulsen. 
 88 pp. Wendy Lamb Books/Random House. 
 $12.99. (Ages 10 and up)
Gary Paulsen's novel ''Lawn Boy'' is a Horatio Alger story for the hedge fund era. Not nearly as earnest as the Alger books, and a lot more fun to read, it's about a 12-year-old Minnesota boy who in the course of a summer earns half a million dollars without really doing a whole lot. Paulsen's unnamed narrator has two non-Horatian advantages: a stockbroker and a piece of heavy equipment. Or sort of heavy; it's an old riding mower given to him by his grandmother as a 12th-birthday present. Though not in the least mechanical-minded, he feels an instant bond with the machine, and almost as soon as he fires it up a neighbor comes by offering to pay 20 bucks for a mowing job. The local lawn care guy, it turns out, has just run off with the wife of a customer, and presumably because he poses less of a sexual threat, Lawn Boy, as we might as well call him, soon has more work than he can handle. So he expands, hiring some undocumented workers, and also invests his profits in the market, starting with some shares in a coffin company. 
 Lawn Boy is guided in all these endeavors by a local day trader named Arnold Howell, who takes it upon himself to initiate the boy into the mysteries and beauties of capitalism. (The chapter titles all sound like an economics textbook: ''Capital Growth Coupled With the Principles of Production Expansion,'' ''Economic Expansion Combined With Portfolio Diversification,'' and the like.) Arnold, who has a bowl-job haircut, wears '70s clothing and says ''groovy'' a lot, is the sort of character who makes an adult reader worry he might be a child molester. But his agenda is apparently benign, and his gift for picking stocks is so good you wonder why he's stuck in Eden Prairie, Minn., instead of on the floor at Bear Stearns. To diversify, he also gets Lawn Boy to invest in a kindly but possibly overconcussed prizefighter named Joseph Powdermilk Jr., a k a Joey Pow, who comes in handy when a bad guy called Rock tries to muscle in on the lawn business.
 All this would be much harder to take were it not for the book's appealing style of narration. Lawn Boy is quick to admit that he is a kid with an ''average brain and average grades,'' and he relates his successes with wonderment. Except perhaps for not being quite gross enough, Paulsen has mastered the very hard trick of sounding exactly like a 12-year-old without being either cute or condescending. Far from bragging about his newfound wealth, moreover, Lawn Boy is a little embarrassed by it, not wanting to show up his hard-working parents. (Mom teaches in an experimental school, and Dad is a not-very-successful inventor.)
 Unusual for books of this sort, which combine enterprise with what is essentially a summer idyll in the way of, say, Robert McCloskey's Homer Price stories or Beverly Cleary's ''Henry and the Paper Route,'' Lawn Boy has no friends, no extra-business adventures and not a clue about what to do with his money. But unlike Arnold, he will probably wind up at a fund like Citadel or Cerberus and amass so much dough that he can endow an entire lawnmower museum.

 BODY:
THE WORLD IS FLAT: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century -- Further Updated and Expanded, by Thomas L. Friedman. (Picador, $16.) Building on his 1999 book, ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree,'' Friedman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times, maps the next phase of globalization. What leveled the world's economic playing field? Friedman cites 10 forces, including the dot-com bubble and bust, which turned China and India into high-tech epicenters of the outsourcing world. ''The World Is Flat'' considers the great opportunities and threats globalization represents to older industrialized nations, especially the United States. In the Book Review, Fareed Zakaria called Friedman's metaphor of a flat world ''ingenious'': ''Its fundamental insight is true and deeply important.'' THE DEVIL'S FEATHER, by Minette Walters. (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard, $13.95.) After she's kidnapped in Baghdad and held for three days by a sadistic mercenary, Connie Burns, a British foreign correspondent and the heroine of Walters's layered thriller, flies home and retreats to a rotting old house in the Dorset countryside. Connie delves into the house's troubled history, terrified that her tormentor hasn't finished with her. 
THE HORIZONTAL WORLD: Growing Up Wild in the Middle of Nowhere, by Debra Marquart. (Counterpoint, $15.) Born into an agricultural family in North Dakota, Marquart escaped the farm for a peripatetic career as a rock musician, poet and English teacher. In this elegiac memoir, Marquart reflects on the price of abandoning her roots.
 GRIEF, by Andrew Holleran. (Hyperion, $12.) In Holleran's slender, elegant fourth novel, a middle-aged gay man mourns his mother, his empty life and his generation of gay men. Arriving in Washington from a small town in the South, the unnamed narrator finds a book of Mary Todd Lincoln's letters and discovers a kindred spirit in a woman who never recovered from her husband's death.
 THE UNITED STATES OF ARUGULA: The Sun-Dried, Cold-Pressed, Dark-Roasted, Extra Virgin Story of the American Food Revolution, by David Kamp. (Broadway, $14.95.) This smart, lively book tells how food in postwar America ''hopped the fence from the ghettos of home economics and snobby gourmandism to the expansive realm of popular culture.'' Kamp, a writer and editor at Vanity Fair and GQ, begins with the three early tastemakers -- James Beard, Julia Child and Craig Claiborne -- and traces a detailed path to Alice Waters and Chez Panisse, the fine-dining franchises created by Mario Batali and Daniel Boulud, and the opening of Dean & DeLuca in SoHo.
 THE PROMISE OF HAPPINESS, by Justin Cartwright. (Bloomsbury, $14.95.) A bitingly funny portrait of a contemporary English family in turmoil, Cartwright's novel is set in motion when the family's linchpin -- the eldest daughter, Juliet -- is released after two years in an American prison for fencing a Tiffany window.
 THE GIRLS WHO WENT AWAY: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v. Wade, by Ann Fessler. (Penguin, $15.) Between the end of World War II and the legalization of abortion nationwide in 1973, 1.5 million babies were given up for adoption in the United States. Fessler's analysis of the social context of adoption includes disturbing oral histories. (She begins and ends the book with the story of her own search for her birth mother.)
 LISEY'S STORY, by Stephen King. (Pocket, $9.99.) Scott Landon, the fragile prize-winning novelist at the core of this haunting love story, is a conduit to the supernatural world. After Scott's death, his widow, Lisey, takes up arms against a murderous stalker in this world and a blood-hungry beast in Boo'ya Moon, a parallel world that sheltered Scott during a horrific childhood and inspired him throughout his creative life. Boo'ya Moon is ''as real as J. M. Barrie's Never-Never Land,'' Jim Windolf wrote here. 
 SPALDING'S WORLD TOUR: The Epic Adventure That Took Baseball Around the Globe -- and Made It America's Game, by Mark Lamster. (PublicAffairs, $14.95.) Lamster rollickingly recreates the six-month exhibition baseball tour that Albert Goodwill Spalding led around the globe in 1888-89.

HEADLINE: Still Jumping Into the Job Pool

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Kristin Hussey contributed reporting from Connecticut, Susan Saiter from Long Island, Nate Schweber from New Jersey and Susan Stewart from Westchester County.

 BODY:
WHEN Cate Fahey applied for a summer job at the J. Crew store at The Westchester mall in April, she must have made a good impression. At age 19, she is outgoing, poised and hard-working.
 She landed the job and is now in the unusual position of holding not just one summer job, but two, at a time when fewer teenagers are working. From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. she works as a counselor at the Larchmont Yacht Club's summer camp. Then, two or three days a week, after rushing to her home in Mamaroneck to shower and change, she drives to her J. Crew job in White Plains to work from 5 to 11 p.m. She helps shoppers find the sizes and styles they want and folds hundreds of slacks and blouses each day.
''I really love working,'' said Ms. Fahey, a sophomore at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., with a double major in government and history. ''My parents didn't want me sitting around all summer.'' If she had sat around, she added, ''I would be very bored and probably weigh quite a bit more.'' 
 By holding even one job, Ms. Fahey is bucking the tide, because less than half of the nation's teenagers aged 16 to 19 are working this summer. Indeed, the percentage holding summer jobs, 42 percent, slid to its lowest level since World War II. Fifty-three percent of teenagers were working in 2000; a decade earlier, 60 percent were, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Economists and sociologists see many explanations for this decline. Immigrants are taking many jobs, like mowing lawns or making beds at summer resorts, once held by teenagers. More Americans over age 60 are staying in the work force in part-time jobs, like a retail clerk, that often go to teenagers. The nation has lost three million manufacturing jobs since 2000, leaving fewer factory jobs for teenagers. The federal government's summer jobs program, which aims to give work experience to low-income teenagers, is a fraction of what it once was, employing fewer than 100,000 teenagers, down from 1.5 million three decades ago.
 The percentage of teenagers working has also declined because many students are taking their academic work more seriously, often taking summer courses, whether at a local community college or at Oxford. ''Teens are paying more attention to school,'' said Teresa L. Morisi, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''There is more pressure to do well in school.''
 While many teenagers are happy to hang out at the mall or laze about at the beach, many others are intent on working.
 ''I decided to work because I want money to buy things,'' said David Rock, a 16-year-old from Freeport , N.Y., who has his eye on more DVD's and clothes. He works full time, selling ice cream at the front counter of the Friendly's restaurant at the Jones Beach central mall. David said it was his idea to work, although he said his parents praised him for showing maturity.
 Betsy Mercado, 16, a junior at W. T. Clarke High School in Westbury, N.Y., serves ice cream alongside him, but is working for a different reason. ''I felt I should help my parents,'' she said. Ms. Mercado, who has three younger sisters, says she gives half her paycheck to her parents. 
 Betsy, slim and wearing silver, heart-shaped earrings, was a little envious of teenagers who spend day after day hanging out at the beach. ''There are times when I feel a little jealous of those who don't have to work, who don't lift a finger because Mom and Dad provide,'' she said.
 Grovert Fuentes, 18, who graduated from North Bergen High School in New Jersey in June, said he was working for reasons beyond having some cash in his pocket. 
 ''You work to gain knowledge, responsibility,'' he said. ''You're going to meet people every day and you have to be on a schedule every day for the rest of your life.'' He averages 30 hours a week as a barista at a Starbucks in Edgewater, N.J., and works 35 hours at the Pathmark there.
 Mr. Fuentes said, ''I choose to do this second job for extra money,'' money that will help pay for college. He plans to enroll at Bergen Community College this fall.
 Standing outside the J. Crew store where Ms. Fahey works, Vincent and Phillip De Santis, 16-year-old twins from Irvington, N.Y., said they were not working this summer because they took a nine-day Caribbean cruise with their family and were concentrating on their summer lacrosse league. Vincent said he hoped to work this fall ''to have my own money,'' saying his parents did not give him a big allowance.
 Sharon Seymour, 16, from Somers, N.Y., who had just come from the Victoria's Secret at The Westchester mall with a friend, said she felt too young for a job. Sharon, who spends many summer days at Jones Beach, said: ''I'd rather not be working. It's not my job yet.''
 But many teenagers do not have summer jobs even though they would like to work. 
 In Newark, Mayor Cory A. Booker was overwhelmed by the eagerness to work that some teenagers have shown. Newark had initially set aside money for 1,200 part-time summer jobs paying $7.15 an hour. But more than 2,000 teenagers applied, so Mr. Booker expanded the program to accommodate 2,000 teenagers at 475 sites, working as lifeguards, park attendants, receptionists and in other jobs. 
 This July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 25 percent of African-American teenagers aged 16 to 19, have jobs, compared with 31 percent of Hispanic teenagers and 60 percent of white teenagers.
 Andrew M. Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, said it was unfortunate that fewer teenagers, especially those from low-income households, were working.
 ''The question is, 'How do you learn how to work?' '' Professor Sum asked. ''The way you learn how to work is by working. The longer we delay having kids work, the more they pick up habits in the street. Low-income kids who are least likely to work are more likely to pick up their habits in the street, like how to dress, how to talk, how to get along with people. It's a bad situation when kids fail to get work early on.''
 In a report released in April, the center found that 54 percent of teenagers from families with incomes above $75,000 work, compared with 43 percent from families with incomes of $20,000 to $40,000. In families with incomes below $20,000, 33 percent of teenagers work. 
 Professor Sum said it was not surprising that a higher percentage of teenagers from higher-income families work. ''Their parents often know someone,'' he said. ''They have connections. And when both parents work, they often tell their kids it's important to work, to finance part of your own education and to learn good work habits.'' 
 Each year college admissions offices consider applicants who held summer jobs or did volunteer work in Costa Rica and other countries. Gregory A. Pyke, senior associate dean of admission at Wesleyan University, said: ''When I read applications, I look for evidence that a student has demonstrated real responsibility. A paid job can be evidence of that, and volunteer work can be similar evidence of that, and some extracurricular positions would have that same responsibility.''
 Mr. Pyke has advice for students who want to help with poverty, homelessness and other social problems that exist abroad as well as ''within 25 miles of where most of our students live.'' 
 ''I like to see students demonstrate that type of responsibility in their own backyard,'' he said. ''Whether it's through paid employment or through similar hours of volunteer work matters less.''
 Gary L. Ross, the dean of admission at Colgate University, said, ''If students are in a position where they do not need to help support their families financially, then I hope they will follow their passion and not think so such about what is going to impress a college admission committee.'' Within that set of passions, he said, it would be good if students could take a job to appreciate the responsibilities of working. ''And I'm not talking about cleaning your mom's law office,'' he said.
 ''We want 14-, 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds to understand that when they're scooping ice cream or flipping hamburgers at McDonald's,'' he said, ''we consider it very valuable to be helping their mother or father or both parents feed their 6- and 7-year-old brothers and sisters.''
 Some teenagers are eager to find jobs that will help their career, while some look for jobs that are fun or fit with their social schedule.
 Ken Parker, a 19-year-old from East Islip, N.Y., who is a sophomore at Northeastern University, is working for $10 an hour at a money management firm, Bellator Capital Partners. His father is friendly with someone who works there. ''I am studying finance so it's good to become acquainted with the vocabulary, the daily routine and the environment,'' he said.
 McLean Crichton, a 19-year-old from Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., who is a sophomore at Emory University, is an SAT instructor with the Princeton Review. He works three to seven hours a day, earning $10 an hour when he proctors tests and $19 an hour when he teaches small groups.
 ''My math has gotten exponentially better,'' he said. His work schedule is much better than those of his friends, he said. ''I see my friends working at Goldman Sachs, going into the city at 6 a.m. and coming home at 6, and they're too tired to do anything with me at night. For now, three to seven hours of work is enough.''
 Roland G. Fuoco, 18, from New Canaan, sounded upbeat about his job as a janitor at the First Presbyterian Church of Fairfield.
 ''It has taught me that when you work at a job it's really what you make of it,'' said Mr. Fuoco, a sophomore at New York University. ''There are fun things you can do to entertain yourself. I have my iPod. I listen to music. I play a lot of air guitar on the brooms and the mops. I can make my own hours, so I can still see my friends.
 ''Any money I have,'' he continued, ''I'm saving so I can eat at school and pay for books. Halfway through the semester, I don't want to be begging at my parents' doorstep for money.''
 Octavia Willis, an 18-year-old graduate of New Rochelle High School in Westchester who occasionally works as a model, took a summer job at Abercrombie & Fitch at The Westchester mall after a manager approached her when she was shopping there and asked if she wanted a job.
 Ms. Willis, who plans to enter the State University at Binghamton in September, said she liked the Abercrombie & Fitch job because she meets different kinds of people. And her manager, Lindsey Donnelly, said she was eager to hire teenagers because ''that's the group we're selling to.''
 Karina Casella, the manager of the J. Crew store where Ms. Fahey works, said teenagers represented about 30 percent of her store's 70 employees this summer. ''We have a good mix of teens and an older crowd,'' she said
 Ms. Fahey said she was saving money for a three-week study trip this winter, probably to Ireland. She expressed no resentment toward students who don't work and whose parents pay for their clothes and movie tickets.
 ''I think that if your parents are willing to do that for you, that's great, but how is that going to help you get a job?'' she asked. ''I think you learn everything about work from having jobs.''

HEADLINE: The Return of a Blast From the Past

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN. 
As told to Alex Mindlin.

 BODY:
 ON June 3, 2005, change came to WCBS-FM, the legendary oldies station that had been home to such memorable disc jockeys as Cousin Brucie (a k a Bruce Morrow) and Dan Ingram. Without warning, the station's management dumped all of its D.J.'s and switched to Jack, a brash new D.J.-less radio format often compared to ''iPod on shuffle,'' playing a wide selection of songs from the 1960s to the present.
Listeners, including Mayor Bloomberg, were shocked, and the station's ratings plummeted. A month ago, WCBS returned to a slightly modified version of its former self, concentrating on hits from 1964 to 1985. Among the D.J.'s rehired was Bob Shannon, a goateed, rumbling 58-year-old who had been the host of the afternoon drive-time show at the station since 1986. 
 ALEX MINDLIN
 When I was a kid growing up in Syracuse, my mother used to listen to rock 'n' roll radio. I hated it. Then, about a year later, I had this epiphany. My mother took me to a record store, and for some reason I got fascinated, not with the records, but with the surveys. They would have the top 50 list of the week. I would sit at home every Saturday, the stations would count down, and I would write down the numbers.
 I had a Sunday night oldies show at WKTQ in Pittsburgh. Then in 1980, I moved from Pittsburgh to New York, where CBS-FM was carrying on the heritage of Top 40 radio. They were bringing in a lot of the D.J.'s who had been the legends of New York radio, and there was a certain delivery style, a certain way of presenting the oldies back then, that I wasn't doing in Pittsburgh. It's what we would call bright or up-tempo. It's friendly, it's paced to the music.
 The station appealed to the guy who came up hanging out on a street corner in the Bronx, but it also appealed to some of the younger, upwardly mobile Manhattanites.
 The station always had a New York feel. There are so many musical groups that originated in New York, especially in Harlem and Brooklyn and the Bronx. Dion is a great example -- Dion and the Belmonts, from Belmont in the Bronx. There was also a whole Harlem scene, with people like Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. In Brooklyn, you had Neil Sedaka, Carole King, all the great singer-songwriters. 
 One reason this kind of radio station can succeed in modern times is because if a record impacted somebody sonically in a certain way -- I don't care if it's 1955, '65, '75 -- a person of the same age hearing it today will have the same reaction. 
 If you get a kid today, he's 15, he hears Little Richard screaming ''a-wop-bop-a-loo,'' he'll have the same reaction that a kid who was 15 in 1955 had. You hear the Beatles for the first time, you hear the Ramones for the first time -- it's the actual physical reaction of the body to the inherent rhythms and tonalities.
 From 1986 until the end of the station in 2005, I did afternoons at WCBS. It happened from time to time that people recognized the voice. I had a cab driver once who went, ''You're Bob Shannon!'' He's got our top 500 list. He was a big fan. 
 I found out about the switch into Jack on June 3, 2005, 15 minutes before I didn't go on to the radio. My shift then was 4 o'clock. I came in, I was sitting in one of the production rooms eating lunch, and I was called into the manager's office. He said, ''We're going to switch to Jack.'' I said, ''Well, what do I do at 4?'' He said, ''You're not going on at 4.''
 Recently a girl came up to me and said: ''I'm 25, and I've listened to you all my life. I was very upset when the station went off the air because I have a 3-year-old son. I wanted to raise him to hear this great music, and I was so disappointed. Now it's back, and I'm so happy.'' 
 Now, she's only 25. Where did she get it from? She got it from her parents and her siblings. That is something so indigenous to New York. It must have to do with the multiplicity of people who live here. You have all ethnic groups, you have all economic levels.
 One day early last month, I received a phone call from Brian Thomas, the program director. He said, ''We're putting the band back together. Would you be interested?'' And I said, ''Yes.'' 
 I was on the air at 1:01 p.m. when we came back on, but we were all in the studio, me and Broadway Bill Lee and Dan Taylor, Joe Causi and Jeff Mazzei -- we were all there as a team. I was the first voice, technically, when it started. I said, ''As I was about to say ----'' That's how I opened it.
 We're still finding stuff from the old CBS-FM. It's almost like the Twilight Zone, it's like it was put on pause for two years. Everything's still here, all the equipment and memorabilia. 
 We're still finding things, even my old headphones. One guy in the production department was one of the board operators during Jack. He took my headphones home two years ago, with the hope that I would return. When I walked in the other day, he said, ''Here are your headphones.'' The whole top was held together by electrical tape. ''Somehow I felt maybe you would come back,'' he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 19, 2007

 CORRECTION:
 An article last Sunday about WCBS-FM's return to an oldies format misspelled the surname of a D.J. rehired by the station. He is Jeff Mazzei, not Mazzie.

HEADLINE: Paving Over Fun

BYLINE: By KEVIN BAKER. 
Kevin Baker is the author of the novels ''Dreamland,'' ''Paradise Alley'' and ''Strivers Row.''

 BODY:
WHERE we come from, fun is much more circumscribed,'' friends from Frankfurt told me, wide-eyed, when I took them out to Coney Island a few years ago. 
 Their amazement was understandable. Among the cacophony of the shooting galleries and the bumper car and skee-ball arcades; the majestic turns of Deno's Wonder Wheel (New York's only combination Ferris wheel and roller coaster!) above us; the dizzying smell of every possible kind of fried food emanating from the blocks of fast-food stands, it is easy to believe that there is nothing that quite approaches Coney Island in Frankfurt, or anywhere else in the world.
My German friends also expressed their amazement that all this marvelous, beachfront property wasn't lined with luxury housing. There is the rub. After so many years of decline and neglect, Coney Island at last has a serious developer, Joseph Sitt. Mr. Sitt, who says his company has spent $120 million buying up land in and around the area's entertainment district, has dangled the idea of erecting a 40-story condominium there. 
 The City Planning Commission, to its credit, scotched this proposal. And last week The Daily News quoted a city official as saying that Mr. Sitt's $1.5 billion plan to create some sort of enclosed, multimedia 21st-century amusement park, complete with time-sharing hotels, was ''dead in the water.'' 
 The question of just what Coney Island should be -- a democratic bastion of raucous, honky-tonk entertainment, or something more genteel -- has been disputed for nearly 200 years. Lately, though, it has become a struggle with a greater resonance, one that may foretell just what the future of New York as a whole will be.
 Because Coney Island lies on the far reaches of the city, its destiny has turned on the availability of transportation and the changing vacation habits of Americans. Better access meant more money, but undermined efforts to keep the place exclusive. When a shell road first connected Coney to the rest of Long Island in 1829, developers dreamed of a resort that would rival Newport, R.I. 
 Renewed attempts to gentrify Coney Island led to the erection of Victorian curios like Coney's Colossus, a 150-foot-high, tin-covered hotel built in the shape of an elephant, with a cigar shop in one of the legs and an observatory in the howdah. This soon became corrupted, a notorious haunt of prostitutes and adulterers. Newport it wasn't.
 ''At night its eyes glowed yellow about the bathhouses and band shells and carousels,'' Richard Snow, Coney's most lyrical chronicler, wrote of the elephant. ''Complex, facetious and a little sinister, it was an augury.''
 It was indeed. By 1904, Steeplechase Park, Luna Park and Dreamland, the world's first true amusement parks, opened along a 12-block stretch of Surf Avenue. These were enormous complexes. Luna alone took up 22 acres. The parks featured countless rides, animal acts, freak shows and huge re-creations of everything from recent floods and volcanic eruptions, to coal mines and tenement fires. Every inch was limned with light bulbs, so that by night the effect was mesmerizing.
 ''Fabulous and beyond conceiving, ineffably beautiful, is this fiery scintillation,'' wrote an awed Maxim Gorky. The architecture alone was fantastic, plywood and plaster palaces unlike anything ever seen before. This was intentional, a straightforward, Industrial Age attempt to make fun a business. 
 ''A spirit of frolic must be manufactured,'' maintained Frederic Thompson, the dreamy impresario of Luna Park, ''and it cannot dwell where straight lines, dignified columns and conventional forms dominate.''
 Manufactured frolic: What a thoroughly American concept! But unlike other mass-manufactured goods, the parks were not intended for everyone, just the nation's growing middle classes. Cheap as admission was, getting out to Coney on the Iron Steamboat Company or the New York and Sea Beach Railroad was still a major expenditure for much of the city's working people. Pandering to what they expected to be an increasingly upscale audience, the parks -- particularly the rather pretentious Dreamland -- made great shows of trying to edify their clientele, including pious ''trips'' to heaven and hell. 
 Yet a rough, slightly malevolent undercurrent crept in. Many of the rides were dangerous contraptions that threw people together in bone-jarring collisions. Patrons of Steeplechase might be whacked with a cattle prod by a clown or given a mild electrical shock if they rested too long on a bench. Exhibits included freak shows, displays of aboriginal peoples, ''cities'' made up entirely of dwarves and midgets; even premature babies, struggling for life in the first incubators. 
 The walls of Luna Park were hung with leering wolf and pig heads. Enormous dance halls opened, accommodating thousands, and featuring two different bands a night. Coney Island's very own Bowery sprung up amid the parks, complete with saloons, brothels and peep shows, and gangsters from Manhattan careered about the streets in their flashy new cars, taking potshots at one another.
 Oddly, though, Coney's peak popularity was not attained until the parks began to burn and crumble. Only after World War I, when the Boardwalk was built and the subway was extended out to Stillwell Avenue, did the area become a working-class destination. Summertime bungalows proliferated, but the biggest crowds -- the grinning, waving mobs of bathers filling those Weegee photos -- didn't show up until after the Second World War.
 And almost at the same moment Coney began its long decline, as all those people made money, moved out of the city, decided they no longer wanted to spend their vacations on a tiny patch of sand. The trip out became too long and arduous on the decaying subway system, the whole area too ridden with crime. Steeplechase, the last of the great parks, closed in 1964. The developer Fred Trump bought the land and held a party where guests were handed bricks and invited to hurl them through the fabled glass trellises that enclosed the park. 
 Nothing rose on the site for nearly 40 years, but now the developers are back. Families have been returning to visit the beach, or the Astroland amusement park, or the new Mets' minor-league ballpark. At the same time, Coney has remained an urban space; diverse and edgy and even seedy in places, much more like the rest of the city was in the 1970s, rather than the ever shinier, duller New York of the 21st century.
 Yet a perfect equilibrium implies stasis, and stasis is anathema to a city. Coney Island will continue to change, as it always has. The question is whether that change will be for the better. 
 New York has always been a wastrel with its cultural treasures. Again and again, we have let unique places vanish, victims of a passing market force or individual whim: the great jazz clubs and jitterbug palaces of Harlem, the Cotton Club and Small's Paradise, the Savoy and the Renaissance Casino, now just a sad, empty hulk on West 138th Street; the old Latin Quarter; Ebbets Field, the Polo Grounds and the original Yankee Stadium; the downtown music clubs like Cafe Society, Max's Kansas City, Danceteria and the newly departed CBGB. 
 Always, in the bustle and the careless optimism of this forward-looking city we have let the past slip away. Some of these changes were inevitable, and I'm not proposing that we save every corner club. But think of how much richer this city would be -- economically and culturally -- if any or all of these institutions still existed. Are we destined to become a city of luxury residences, stacked one upon the other?
 The city cannot simply react to developers' plans if it is to save Coney Island. The Bloomberg administration, which has recently shown a heartening interest in reviving the idea of city planning, needs to get ahead of the process and solicit ideas for what Coney should be. The dozens of small businesses that stuck it out through Coney's worst years and did so much to preserve its honky-tonk flavor should be encouraged to stay. Strange as it may seem, Frederic Thompson had it right. We will have to manufacture frolic if we are to have it at all.

 BODY:
THE NEWSBarry Bonds blasted a fastball over the fence in right-center field in AT&T Park in San Francisco to surpass Hank Aaron's career home record.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Aaron's record of 755 home runs had stood for 31 years before Bonds, with what George Vecsey of The Times described as the ''measured, disciplined stroke of a martial-arts master,'' hit the full-count, 84 mile-per-hour pitch by Mike Bacsik of the Washington Nationals. Aaron congratulated Bonds in a videotaped message shown on the scoreboard. Bonds's chase of the record is over, but the debate will continue over its validity because of the suspicion that he used steroids.
THE NEWSRobert L. Nardelli, who was ousted as Home Depot's chief executive in January, was hired to revitalize Chrysler. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Nardelli left Home Depot with a $210 million exit package and a reputation as an imperious boss who made strategic blunders. But before that, he had been a highly regarded senior manager at General Electric, where he worked with several executives of the private equity firm that now owns Chrysler. He has his work cut out for him as an outsider entering a struggling industry at a time that Japanese automakers are ascendant. But he also has an incentive: his pay will be tied to the automaker's success. 
 THE NEWS The founders of Gap announced plans for a new art museum in San Francisco devoted to their extensive collection of Modern art.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Donald and Doris Fisher opened their first Gap store in San Francisco in 1969. Today, Gap is the nation's largest specialty apparel chain. Along the way, the Fishers made billions and built an impressive art collection of more than 1,000 pieces, including works by Chuck Close, Richard Serra and Alexander Calder. Now the Fishers hope to build a 100,000-square-foot museum on the city's Presidio and pay for its operation. ''I want to have a little curatorial fun while I'm living,'' said Mr. Fisher, who is 78.
 THE NEWS The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged, despite the recent tumult in credit markets and on Wall Street.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The Fed's monetary policy committee said its major concern ''remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.'' It suggested it would cut rates only if conditions deteriorate badly. Wall Street has been on edge over concern that tighter limits on borrowing by corporations and home buyers alike could stall the economy. The Fed acknowledged the volatility in the financial markets and the tougher credit conditions, but said ''the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace.''
 THE NEWS Forbes magazine named the actor Matt Damon as Hollywood's best investment as his latest film, ''The Bourne Ultimatum,'' took in $70.2 million on its opening weekend.
 BEHIND THE NEWS For every dollar Mr. Damon earned for his last three films, he brought in $29 in gross income to the studio, according to Forbes, which ranked him ahead of Brad Pitt ($24), Johnny Depp ($21), Tom Cruise ($11) and Will Smith ($10). August is often a dumping ground for subpar films, but the latest of the Bourne films, starring Mr. Damon as a political assassin with amnesia, provided Universal Pictures with one of its strongest openings ever.

HEADLINE: A Fictional Minority

BYLINE: By STANLEY FISH. 
Stanley Fish, a contributing columnist to TimesSelect, is a guest columnist. Maureen Dowd and Thomas L. Friedman are off today.

 BODY:
The buzz about the new ABC show ''Cavemen'' is not good. The negative vibes take two forms. Some who have seen the pilot episode find it slapdash, poorly written and unfunny. Others worry that the show will reinforce racial stereotypes by encouraging viewers to identify the maligned Cro-Magnons with African-Americans. 
 If those who voice the first kind of criticism turn out be right, there will be nothing more to say; after the first week, no one will be watching. The moral objection is a trickier matter, too tricky it seems for the show's producers, who are backpedaling as fast as they can. 
Asked about the charge that plotlines like the perils of interspecies dating seem racially insensitive, one of the producers, Josh Gordon, disclaimed any intention to have the cavemen ''stand in for'' any racial group. The show, he insisted, is about ''the fish-out-of-water experience.'' (As a fish out of water myself, I'm tired of people who think that they can deflect criticism by hiding behind a fish metaphor.)
 Another producer, Mike Schiff, added that he and his colleagues just want people to ''care about these three guys under a lot of makeup.'' 
 Maybe the producers should read the description of their show on the network's Web site: ''They have been around since the dawn of time ... making them one of the world's oldest minorities. ... Joel, Nick and Andy have to overcome prejudice from most of the Homo sapien world.''
 Of course it's a show about minorities and racism, despite the writer Joe Lawson's demurrer that it's really about people struggling to acclimate, ''something everybody deals with ...whether you're a minority or not.'' 
 Why all this pussyfooting? The truth is that there is nothing risky or edgy about a show taking on (or pretending to take on) racial discrimination. Nothing could be safer, for reasons explained briskly by Walter Benn Michaels in ''The Trouble With Diversity: How We Learned to Love Identity and Ignore Inequality,'' just issued in paperback.
 Michaels's big point is that Americans, especially Americans on the left, love discrimination. Not that they love to practice discrimination; they love to deplore the fact of discrimination. And they love to propose strategies for lessening it: affirmative action, the celebration of diversity, the promotion of a culture of respect. 
 The reason we love those strategies, Michaels says, is that they involve cosmetic changes that allow us to feel good about ourselves while also allowing us to turn our eyes away from the economic inequalities that remain untouched as we busily respect everyone in sight.
 Respect is an easy coin to proffer; it doesn't cost much.
 Michaels argues that if we think ''racism is the problem we need to solve,'' all we have to do to solve it is ''give up our prejudices.'' But if we think our problem is that too many people are poor, hungry, homeless and uneducated, solving that problem ''might require us to give up our money.'' 
 Far easier to add three minority representatives to the board of directors, or 10 minority faculty members to the roster of an Ivy League college, and then congratulate ourselves for having fought the good fight by slightly altering some statistics. Confession, absolution and good works in one pain-free package. What a bargain!
 So bring on the cavemen. If Michaels is right, and the differences we ritually complain about are the differences we love (because beating our breasts about them is a cheap form of virtue), any controversy that the show might provoke will fit right into the society's unwillingness to contemplate real social change.
 Already, before the first episode is broadcast (if it ever is), we're getting a taste of what is to come. After ABC canceled his show, the comedian George Lopez began talking as if he had been the victim of discrimination. ''So a Chicano can't be on TV, but a caveman can?'' he said. 
 Is Lopez upset because one minority is being preferred to another? Does he believe there are cavemen? Or is he upset because a fictional minority is being preferred to a real one? Would he feel better if it were not cavemen, but Gypsies?
 As long as the show, even in prospect, generates questions like these, and as long as such questions define the parameters of social concern, no C.E.O. making $130 million a year need worry about a thing.

HEADLINE: Eminent Domain Law, New and Improved

 BODY:
Eminent Domain Law, New and Improved
To the Editor:
 We read with interest and some amazement ''Now You Own It, Soon You Don't?'' (July 29). It describes certain state measures to curb the worst abuses of eminent domain by taking private property in order to make the property available to another private property owner. 
 In Connecticut, the General Assembly modified the state's eminent domain law, and it was signed by Gov. M. Jodi Rell. 
 The new law was definitely a compromise between advocates for no taking of private property for private development and advocates who demanded consideration to improve deplorable conditions in some urban areas and the need for redevelopment.
 What came out of this political compromise was a refined process that requires more transparency, public input and requiring that the municipality weigh the public benefit against the private taking.
 In cases where the municipality decides to move forward with acquiring private property for economic development purposes, by eminent domain, the town or city is required to obtain a two-thirds municipal approval, and is required to compensate residential and business property owners an amount at least 25 percent higher than the appraised market value.
 The Connecticut move is one in a better direction to help curb eminent domain abuses.

HEADLINE: LETTERS Buying Local Food Is Still Better

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Food That Travels Well'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 6), James E. McWilliams explains something counterintuitive: sometimes foods with low ''food miles'' can squander more carbon than foods that have traveled further to get to you. So what's the environmentally concerned consumer to do?
How about asking for a sensible carbon tax on fossil fuels, so that the lamb chop that consumed vast quantities of carbon in the form of feed fertilizers, jet fuel and diesel would cost more than the lamp chop that consumed less, wherever it was raised? 
 Jessica Avery Newton, Mass., Aug. 6, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 James E. McWilliams asserts that a study by Lincoln University in New Zealand indicated that ''it is four times more energy-efficient for Londoners to buy lamb imported from the other side of the world than to buy it from a producer in their backyard,'' because ''poorer British pastures force farmers to use feed.'' 
 While this finding is certainly convenient for New Zealand's lucrative food export industry, it overlooks a central issue: to achieve sustainability in agriculture, we need to adjust our eating habits accordingly. 
 In other words, if it is so inefficient to produce lamb locally that it is better for the environment to import it from New Zealand, maybe, just maybe, we should be eating less of it. 
 Lara A. Ballard Washington, Aug. 6, 2007
 To the Editor:
 James E. McWilliams provides a provocative, thoughtful way to consider ''food miles,'' yet I do not agree with his statement that ''we must accept that buying local is not necessarily beneficial for the environment.''
 Sure, transporting grass-fed lamb from New Zealand to Britain might use less petroleum than feeding corn to British sheep, but that is not the whole story. In the 1980s, as a result of the loss of farm subsidies, some New Zealand farmers went through a radical (and painful) process of changing their farming practices over to feeding livestock on grass grown in their pastures. This is what makes their lamb less dependent on petroleum.
 What we need is to encourage farmers throughout the world to return to grass farming. Then ''local'' will truly be better for the environment, as well as better for reasons few care to criticize -- superior flavor, our health and a better local economy. 
 Anne McKeithen Charlottesville, Va., Aug. 6, 2007
 To the Editor:
 James E. McWilliams makes an interesting argument for regional food distribution systems over local ones. His comments on ''food miles'' are thoughtful, but there is another reason, beyond environmental concerns, for developing and supporting local food, and that is food security.
 The day may come, suddenly or gradually, when current distribution systems no longer function. That fact should put farmers' markets and community gardens, like Victory Gardens during World War II, front and center of cultural change. 
 Molly McCluer Memphis, Aug. 6, 2007
 To the Editor:
 James E. McWilliams widens the lens on the carbon impact of eating locally, but he doesn't go the last mile. Because outlets for locally grown meat and produce are fewer and farther between than ordinary grocery stores, most consumers have to drive farther to get to them. If each locavore drives his Prius an extra 10 miles to buy a local chicken, that's 3.5 pounds of emissions, or 1,400 pounds per ton of chicken (assuming beefy five-pound birds). Even if each buyer stocks up on several chickens, that's a lot of carbon. 
 Tamar Haspel New York, Aug. 6, 2007
 To the Editor:
 While I applaud James E. McWilliams's tacit recognition that the issue of food sustainability is not as trivial as ''eat locally,'' I believe that he misses an important and fundamental aspect of the transition to any form of environmental, social or economic sustainability. 
 His argument assumes that our society will be able to maintain our current quality and quantity of consumption in a sustainable future. While this might be a best-of-all-possible-worlds scenario, it is far more likely -- if not certain -- that our patterns of consumption will be forced to change. 
 We might not necessarily eat less (though many argue for this on health grounds), but we should anticipate that our diets will conform more to the available foods than to our epicurean whims. As some new food books suggest, a more geographically and temporally local diet can not only be healthier for the body and the environment, but can also be more interesting and flavorful.

HEADLINE: Still Jumping Into the Job Pool

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Kristin Hussey contributed reporting from Connecticut, Susan Saiter from Long Island, Nate Schweber from New Jersey and Susan Stewart from Westchester County.

 BODY:
WHEN Cate Fahey applied for a summer job at the J. Crew store at The Westchester mall in April, she must have made a good impression. At age 19, she is outgoing, poised and hard-working.
 She landed the job and is now in the unusual position of holding not just one summer job, but two, at a time when fewer teenagers are working. From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. she works as a counselor at the Larchmont Yacht Club's summer camp. Then, two or three days a week, after rushing to her home in Mamaroneck to shower and change, she drives to her J. Crew job in White Plains to work from 5 to 11 p.m. She helps shoppers find the sizes and styles they want and folds hundreds of slacks and blouses each day.
''I really love working,'' said Ms. Fahey, a sophomore at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., with a double major in government and history. ''My parents didn't want me sitting around all summer.'' If she had sat around, she added, ''I would be very bored and probably weigh quite a bit more.'' 
 By holding even one job, Ms. Fahey is bucking the tide, because less than half of the nation's teenagers aged 16 to 19 are working this summer. Indeed, the percentage holding summer jobs, 42 percent, slid to its lowest level since World War II. Fifty-three percent of teenagers were working in 2000; a decade earlier, 60 percent were, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Economists and sociologists see many explanations for this decline. Immigrants are taking many jobs, like mowing lawns or making beds at summer resorts, once held by teenagers. More Americans over age 60 are staying in the work force in part-time jobs, like a retail clerk, that often go to teenagers. The nation has lost three million manufacturing jobs since 2000, leaving fewer factory jobs for teenagers. The federal government's summer jobs program, which aims to give work experience to low-income teenagers, is a fraction of what it once was, employing fewer than 100,000 teenagers, down from 1.5 million three decades ago.
 The percentage of teenagers working has also declined because many students are taking their academic work more seriously, often taking summer courses, whether at a local community college or at Oxford. ''Teens are paying more attention to school,'' said Teresa L. Morisi, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''There is more pressure to do well in school.''
 While many teenagers are happy to hang out at the mall or laze about at the beach, many others are intent on working.
 ''I decided to work because I want money to buy things,'' said David Rock, a 16-year-old from Freeport who has his eye on more DVD's and clothes. He works full time, selling ice cream at the front counter of the Friendly's restaurant at the Jones Beach central mall. David said it was his idea to work, although he said his parents praised him for showing maturity.
 Betsy Mercado, 16, a junior at W. T. Clarke High School in Westbury, serves ice cream alongside him, but is working for a different reason. ''I felt I should help my parents,'' she said. Ms. Mercado, who has three younger sisters, says she gives half her paycheck to her parents. 
 Betsy, slim and wearing silver, heart-shaped earrings, was a little envious of teenagers who spend day after day hanging out at the beach. ''There are times when I feel a little jealous of those who don't have to work, who don't lift a finger because Mom and Dad provide,'' she said.
 Grovert Fuentes, 18, who graduated from North Bergen High School in New Jersey in June, said he was working for reasons beyond having some cash in his pocket. 
 ''You work to gain knowledge, responsibility,'' he said. ''You're going to meet people every day and you have to be on a schedule every day for the rest of your life.'' He averages 30 hours a week as a barista at a Starbucks in Edgewater, N.J., and works 35 hours at the Pathmark there.
 Mr. Fuentes said, ''I choose to do this second job for extra money,'' money that will help pay for college. He plans to enroll at Bergen Community College this fall.
 Standing outside the J. Crew store where Ms. Fahey works, Vincent and Phillip De Santis, 16-year-old twins from Irvington, N.Y., said they were not working this summer because they took a nine-day Caribbean cruise with their family and were concentrating on their summer lacrosse league. Vincent said he hoped to work this fall ''to have my own money,'' saying his parents did not give him a big allowance.
 Sharon Seymour, 16, from Somers, N.Y., who had just come from the Victoria's Secret at The Westchester mall with a friend, said she felt too young for a job. Sharon, who spends many summer days at Jones Beach, said: ''I'd rather not be working. It's not my job yet.''
 But many teenagers do not have summer jobs even though they would like to work. 
 In Newark, Mayor Cory A. Booker was overwhelmed by the eagerness to work that some teenagers have shown. Newark had initially set aside money for 1,200 part-time summer jobs paying $7.15 an hour. But more than 2,000 teenagers applied, so Mr. Booker expanded the program to accommodate 2,000 teenagers at 475 sites, working as lifeguards, park attendants, receptionists and in other jobs. 
 This July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 25 percent of African-American teenagers aged 16 to 19, have jobs, compared with 31 percent of Hispanic teenagers and 60 percent of white teenagers.
 Andrew M. Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, said it was unfortunate that fewer teenagers, especially those from low-income households, were working.
 ''The question is, 'How do you learn how to work?' '' Professor Sum asked. ''The way you learn how to work is by working. The longer we delay having kids work, the more they pick up habits in the street. Low-income kids who are least likely to work are more likely to pick up their habits in the street, like how to dress, how to talk, how to get along with people. It's a bad situation when kids fail to get work early on.''
 In a report released in April, the center found that 54 percent of teenagers from families with incomes above $75,000 work, compared with 43 percent from families with incomes of $20,000 to $40,000. In families with incomes below $20,000, 33 percent of teenagers work. 
 Professor Sum said it was not surprising that a higher percentage of teenagers from higher-income families work. ''Their parents often know someone,'' he said. ''They have connections. And when both parents work, they often tell their kids it's important to work, to finance part of your own education and to learn good work habits.'' 
 Each year college admissions offices consider applicants who held summer jobs or did volunteer work in Costa Rica and other countries. Gregory A. Pyke, senior associate dean of admission at Wesleyan University, said: ''When I read applications, I look for evidence that a student has demonstrated real responsibility. A paid job can be evidence of that, and volunteer work can be similar evidence of that, and some extracurricular positions would have that same responsibility.''
 Mr. Pyke has advice for students who want to help with poverty, homelessness and other social problems that exist abroad as well as ''within 25 miles of where most of our students live.'' 
 ''I like to see students demonstrate that type of responsibility in their own backyard,'' he said. ''Whether it's through paid employment or through similar hours of volunteer work matters less.''
 Gary L. Ross, the dean of admission at Colgate University, said, ''If students are in a position where they do not need to help support their families financially, then I hope they will follow their passion and not think so such about what is going to impress a college admission committee.'' Within that set of passions, he said, it would be good if students could take a job to appreciate the responsibilities of working. ''And I'm not talking about cleaning your mom's law office,'' he said.
 ''We want 14-, 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds to understand that when they're scooping ice cream or flipping hamburgers at McDonald's,'' he said, ''we consider it very valuable to be helping their mother or father or both parents feed their 6- and 7-year-old brothers and sisters.''
 Some teenagers are eager to find jobs that will help their career, while some look for jobs that are fun or fit with their social schedule.
 Ken Parker, a 19-year-old from East Islip who is a sophomore at Northeastern University, is working for $10 an hour at a money management firm, Bellator Capital Partners. His father is friendly with someone who works there. ''I am studying finance so it's good to become acquainted with the vocabulary, the daily routine and the environment,'' he said.
 McLean Crichton, a 19-year-old from Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., who is a sophomore at Emory University, is an SAT instructor with the Princeton Review. He works three to seven hours a day, earning $10 an hour when he proctors tests and $19 an hour when he teaches small groups.
 ''My math has gotten exponentially better,'' he said. His work schedule is much better than those of his friends, he said. ''I see my friends working at Goldman Sachs, going into the city at 6 a.m. and coming home at 6, and they're too tired to do anything with me at night. For now, three to seven hours of work is enough.''
 Roland G. Fuoco, 18, from New Canaan, Conn., sounded upbeat about his job as a janitor at the First Presbyterian Church of Fairfield.
 ''It has taught me that when you work at a job it's really what you make of it,'' said Mr. Fuoco, a sophomore at New York University. ''There are fun things you can do to entertain yourself. I have my iPod. I listen to music. I play a lot of air guitar on the brooms and the mops. I can make my own hours, so I can still see my friends.
 ''Any money I have,'' he continued, ''I'm saving so I can eat at school and pay for books. Halfway through the semester, I don't want to be begging at my parents' doorstep for money.''
 Octavia Willis, an 18-year-old graduate of New Rochelle High School in Westchester who occasionally works as a model, took a summer job at Abercrombie & Fitch at The Westchester mall after a manager approached her when she was shopping there and asked if she wanted a job.
 Ms. Willis, who plans to enter the State University at Binghamton in September, said she liked the Abercrombie & Fitch job because she meets different kinds of people. And her manager, Lindsey Donnelly, said she was eager to hire teenagers because ''that's the group we're selling to.''
 Karina Casella, the manager of the J. Crew store where Ms. Fahey works, said teenagers represented about 30 percent of her store's 70 employees this summer. ''We have a good mix of teens and an older crowd,'' she said
 Ms. Fahey said she was saving money for a three-week study trip this winter, probably to Ireland. She expressed no resentment toward students who don't work and whose parents pay for their clothes and movie tickets.
 ''I think that if your parents are willing to do that for you, that's great, but how is that going to help you get a job?'' she asked. ''I think you learn everything about work from having jobs.''

Congestion Pricing and Working Artists
To the Editor:
 Re ''Congestion Pricing, Still Alive'' (editorial, July 29): 
 One of the most infuriating things about the congestion pricing plan is that it assumes everyone is the same, and that public transportation is always an available and viable alternative. How ironic that Mayor Bloomberg has neglected to consider the very people who make New York the arts capital he's claimed to care so much about. 
 Take musicians, many of whom need to navigate the city with large instruments and sound equipment in order to do what we do in the clubs and concert halls that contribute so much to the city's economy, vibrancy, reputation and very identity. 
 If a toll of less than $10 seems negligible, the fact is that many working musicians today earn no more than musicians did 50 years ago (that is no exaggeration, and that's actual dollars, not dollars adjusted for inflation). Musicians I know, myself among them, take public transportation when we can. But there are times it just doesn't work. 
 In fact, I'd like to see the mayor hop on subway during rush hour and then walk six blocks in the rain carrying an acoustic bass, an amp, a keyboard, music stands and a drum kit.

HEADLINE: World's Best Medical Care?

 BODY:
Many Americans are under the delusion that we have ''the best health care system in the world,'' as President Bush sees it, or provide the ''best medical care in the world,'' as Rudolph Giuliani declared last week. That may be true at many top medical centers. But the disturbing truth is that this country lags well behind other advanced nations in delivering timely and effective care.
 Michael Moore struck a nerve in his new documentary, ''Sicko,'' when he extolled the virtues of the government-run health care systems in France, England, Canada and even Cuba while deploring the failures of the largely private insurance system in this country. There is no question that Mr. Moore overstated his case by making foreign systems look almost flawless. But there is a growing body of evidence that, by an array of pertinent yardsticks, the United States is a laggard not a leader in providing good medical care. 
Seven years ago, the World Health Organization made the first major effort to rank the health systems of 191 nations. France and Italy took the top two spots; the United States was a dismal 37th. More recently, the highly regarded Commonwealth Fund has pioneered in comparing the United States with other advanced nations through surveys of patients and doctors and analysis of other data. Its latest report, issued in May, ranked the United States last or next-to-last compared with five other nations -- Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom -- on most measures of performance, including quality of care and access to it. Other comparative studies also put the United States in a relatively bad light. 
 Insurance coverage. All other major industrialized nations provide universal health coverage, and most of them have comprehensive benefit packages with no cost-sharing by the patients. The United States, to its shame, has some 45 million people without health insurance and many more millions who have poor coverage. Although the president has blithely said that these people can always get treatment in an emergency room, many studies have shown that people without insurance postpone treatment until a minor illness becomes worse, harming their own health and imposing greater costs.
 Access. Citizens abroad often face long waits before they can get to see a specialist or undergo elective surgery. Americans typically get prompter attention, although Germany does better. The real barriers here are the costs facing low-income people without insurance or with skimpy coverage. But even Americans with above-average incomes find it more difficult than their counterparts abroad to get care on nights or weekends without going to an emergency room, and many report having to wait six days or more for an appointment with their own doctors.
 Fairness. The United States ranks dead last on almost all measures of equity because we have the greatest disparity in the quality of care given to richer and poorer citizens. Americans with below-average incomes are much less likely than their counterparts in other industrialized nations to see a doctor when sick, to fill prescriptions or to get needed tests and follow-up care.
 Healthy lives. We have known for years that America has a high infant mortality rate, so it is no surprise that we rank last among 23 nations by that yardstick. But the problem is much broader. We rank near the bottom in healthy life expectancy at age 60, and 15th among 19 countries in deaths from a wide range of illnesses that would not have been fatal if treated with timely and effective care. The good news is that we have done a better job than other industrialized nations in reducing smoking. The bad news is that our obesity epidemic is the worst in the world.
 Quality. In a comparison with five other countries, the Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States first in providing the ''right care'' for a given condition as defined by standard clinical guidelines and gave it especially high marks for preventive care, like Pap smears and mammograms to detect early-stage cancers, and blood tests and cholesterol checks for hypertensive patients. But we scored poorly in coordinating the care of chronically ill patients, in protecting the safety of patients, and in meeting their needs and preferences, which drove our overall quality rating down to last place. American doctors and hospitals kill patients through surgical and medical mistakes more often than their counterparts in other industrialized nations. 
 Life and death. In a comparison of five countries, the United States had the best survival rate for breast cancer, second best for cervical cancer and childhood leukemia, worst for kidney transplants, and almost-worst for liver transplants and colorectal cancer. In an eight-country comparison, the United States ranked last in years of potential life lost to circulatory diseases, respiratory diseases and diabetes and had the second highest death rate from bronchitis, asthma and emphysema. Although several factors can affect these results, it seems likely that the quality of care delivered was a significant contributor.
 Patient satisfaction. Despite the declarations of their political leaders, many Americans hold surprisingly negative views of their health care system. Polls in Europe and North America seven to nine years ago found that only 40 percent of Americans were satisfied with the nation's health care system, placing us 14th out of 17 countries. In recent Commonwealth Fund surveys of five countries, American attitudes stand out as the most negative, with a third of the adults surveyed calling for rebuilding the entire system, compared with only 13 percent who feel that way in Britain and 14 percent in Canada. 
 That may be because Americans face higher out-of-pocket costs than citizens elsewhere, are less apt to have a long-term doctor, less able to see a doctor on the same day when sick, and less apt to get their questions answered or receive clear instructions from a doctor. On the other hand, Gallup polls in recent years have shown that three-quarters of the respondents in the United States, in Canada and in Britain rate their personal care as excellent or good, so it could be hard to motivate these people for the wholesale change sought by the disaffected.
 Use of information technology. Shockingly, despite our vaunted prowess in computers, software and the Internet, much of our health care system is still operating in the dark ages of paper records and handwritten scrawls. American primary care doctors lag years behind doctors in other advanced nations in adopting electronic medical records or prescribing medications electronically. This makes it harder to coordinate care, spot errors and adhere to standard clinical guidelines.
 Top-of-the-line care. Despite our poor showing in many international comparisons, it is doubtful that many Americans, faced with a life-threatening illness, would rather be treated elsewhere. We tend to think that our very best medical centers are the best in the world. But whether this is a realistic assessment or merely a cultural preference for the home team is difficult to say. Only when better measures of clinical excellence are developed will discerning medical shoppers know for sure who is the best of the best.
 With health care emerging as a major issue in the presidential campaign and in Congress, it will be important to get beyond empty boasts that this country has ''the best health care system in the world'' and turn instead to fixing its very real defects. The main goal should be to reduce the huge number of uninsured, who are a major reason for our poor standing globally. But there is also plenty of room to improve our coordination of care, our use of computerized records, communications between doctors and patients, and dozens of other factors that impair the quality of care. The world's most powerful economy should be able to provide a health care system that really is the best.

HEADLINE: Side Impact

BYLINE: By Pilar Viladas

 BODY:
Diana Vreeland's maxim ''Elegance is refusal'' referred to fashion, but it certainly applies to architecture. A shining (or shimmering) example is this Hudson Valley retreat. It was designed by the architect Thomas Phifer (with Greg Reaves, a partner in his firm) for Cristina Grajales, a gallerist and consultant in 20th-century and contemporary design and decorative arts, and Isabelle Kirshner, a criminal-defense attorney. The 2,200-square-foot, two-bedroom house may be small, but it's grand in all the ways that count: its elegant proportions, its skillful combination of lofty and intimate spaces and its clever use of inexpensive materials to maximum effect. 
Phifer, whose current projects range from a museum in North Carolina to new street lighting for New York City, has designed several sleek private houses, most of them with considerably fatter budgets than this one. But the architect loved the ''small but beautiful'' site the women had bought, complete with a pond. ''What I've always liked about the Hudson River Valley is its sense of grandeur,'' Phifer explains. ''I wanted that sense of monumentality within a small, intimate space.''
 Architect and clients agreed that for economy's sake, the house should be a plain, wood-sided box, with a single living-dining-kitchen space on the first floor and two small bedrooms and a tiny library/guest room on the second. But beyond that, Grajales and Kirshner got more than they bargained for. A double-height entry at one end of the house is echoed at the other by a double-height screened porch, the sheer elegance of which belies its prosaic function. Phifer covered the long north and south sides of the house with full-height screens of perforated, corrugated stainless steel, an idea that his clients found alarming at first. ''The screens seemed as if they would overpower the landscape,'' Grajales recalls. But once they were installed, she and Kirshner realized that the rippling metal scrims in fact gently reflected their surroundings. ''They made the house even lighter,'' Grajales says. ''They look like lace in the summer, and in the snow, the house disappears.'' 
 The screens are as useful as they are striking. Phifer notes that they shield the house from the sun and facilitate ventilation. Since Grajales and Kirshner consider air-conditioning to be environmentally wasteful, the house is punctuated with skylights that, in addition to flooding it with soft daylight, can be opened and closed to keep it cool. 
 Phifer relished the challenge of designing a small house on a budget: ''I like paring architecture down,'' he says. ''Small projects become more jewel-like.'' And his clients love the finished product. ''The outside is always part of the inside,'' says Kirshner, a confirmed city dweller who probably never thought she'd look forward to chopping wood on the weekends. Grajales is even more besotted with their bucolic getaway: ''We just want to move there.''

 The bestial murders in Cheshire of the wife and two daughters of Dr. William Petit demands a thorough overhaul of the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles (''Protecting the Public Came Last,'' editorial, Aug. 5). 
Call for a Clean Slate After a Terrible Crime
 It is not enough to just remove the chairman, Robert Farr, a longstanding governmental functionary who has been board chairman for only six months. 
 The entire board membership should be replaced with disciplined individuals who will insist on obtaining all the proper documents before releasing felons on an unsuspecting community. 
 The public must not be handed another typical bureaucratic whitewash. The current parole board's crew of indifferent, if not reckless, members has marred this fine community with an indelible blood-red stain.

 Eminent Domain Law, New and Improved
 To the Editor:
 We read with interest and some amazement ''Now You Own It, Soon You Don't?'' (July 29). It describes certain state measures to curb the worst abuses of eminent domain by taking private property in order to make the property available to another private property owner.
 In Connecticut, the General Assembly modified the state's eminent domain law, and it was signed by Gov. M. Jodi Rell. 
 The new law was definitely a compromise between advocates for no taking of private property for private development and advocates who demanded consideration to improve deplorable conditions in some urban areas and the need for redevelopment.
 What came out of this political compromise was a refined process that requires more transparency, public input and requiring that the municipality weigh the public benefit against the private taking.
 In cases where the municipality decides to move forward with acquiring private property for economic development purposes, by eminent domain, the town or city is required to obtain a two-thirds municipal approval, and is required to compensate residential and business property owners an amount at least 25 percent higher than the appraised market value.
 The Connecticut move is one in a better direction to help curb eminent domain abuses.

 Habits of Convenience, Not Easily Broken
 To the Editor:
 In ''Greening Up by Cutting Down on Plastic Bags'' (Aug. 5) a mother of twins states that she will ''never be convinced'' to bring her own bags, claiming it's hard enough to remember what she needs when she goes shopping. 
 It reminds me that when habits of convenience are challenged, many people take refuge in a defiant position of entitlement and consumer hubris. 
 Sadly, without either a legislated incentive to carry reusable bags or one levied privately by the store, most people will not change their habituated behaviors, even if it means a cleaner and saner world for their children.

HEADLINE: Beijing '08: Let the Politics Begin

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
BEIJING
 THE Communist Party expends much effort trying to remove politics from daily life in China, and now it wants to remove politics from the Olympics, too. Beijing Olympic officials are taking the line that political protesters agitating about China are violating the spirit and charter of the Games. 
 Poor sports, so to speak.
 But if anything was evident last week when Beijing staged a one-year countdown to the 2008 Games, it was that eliminating politics from the Olympics was about as likely as eliminating medals. Beijing may have envisioned a public relations opportunity, but so did an array of advocacy groups that spent the week whipsawing China on human rights violations, press freedom and Tibet.
 If a few stunts were daring -- protesters unfurled a ''Free Tibet'' banner on the Great Wall -- the criticisms weren't new. What did change was the way the Olympics amplified the dissent, even for a non-event like the one-year countdown. Media attention intensified merely because the Olympics were in town. 
 ''All of these voices are going to become stronger and stronger, not weaker and weaker, as the Games approach,'' said John MacAloon, an Olympic historian who has advised the Beijing Olympic committee on managing the traditional torch relay. ''All Olympic Games are, of course, highly politically charged and sensitive in some regions of the world. How could they not be?''
 For about as long as the modern Games have existed, they have served as a stage for politics as much as sport. Berlin 1936 was Hitler and Jesse Owens. Helsinki 1952 was the beginning of the cold war. Mexico City 1968 was the Black Power salute. The blood of 11 slain Israeli athletes stained Munich 1972. Moscow 1980 meant boycotts, as did Los Angeles four years later.
 Beijing knows politics cannot really be tabled. Even before China was selected in 2001, international opinion was sharply divided between those who thought the Games could help reform the world's largest authoritarian state and those who thought they would simply validate the regime. Politicization has only deepened in recent months with controversies over pollution and the safety of Chinese products (including some Olympic trinkets).
 One historical comparison studied by the party and its critics is Seoul 1988. There the Olympics reshaped political history when public anticipation of the Games fed demonstrations that toppled an authoritarian regime and ushered in democracy. 
 Does anyone really believe that that kind of political collapse is possible for Beijing? Almost no one. But in the abstract, Seoul gives sustenance to those mindful of an Olympic formula that can at least accelerate political liberalization and create more official tolerance for dissent in China: an authoritarian state, eager for validation, wobbles under the heat of international scrutiny and criticism and then loosens its grip. 
 Without question, the Communist Party is eager to stage a successful Olympics, and the Chinese public is ecstatic about holding the Games. China regards the event as a coming-out party to highlight its economic rise and emergence as a world power. But that eagerness is also providing an opening for the party's critics. That was never clearer than when the actress Mia Farrow attacked China for contributing to the atrocities in Darfur through its huge subsidies to oil-rich Sudan. China had seemed indifferent about international criticism over its role in Sudan until Ms. Farrow wrote an article in The Wall Street Journal in March that popularized the phrase ''Genocide Olympics.'' The article called out Steven Spielberg for his involvement in the staging of the opening ceremonies in Beijing. Boycott talk picked up a bit of steam. By August, China was suddenly part of a unanimous United Nations Security Council endorsing peacekeepers for Darfur. Some politicians in Europe and the United States have continued to promote a boycott, but the chances seem slim. 
 Still, other advocacy groups got the message. In April, Chinese authorities arrested four pro-Tibetan independence protesters who had climbed to the Mount Everest base camp and hung a banner to protest plans to take the Olympic torch through the Tibetan Himalayas. 
 Countdown week presented another opportunity. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released reports denouncing China for failing to honor its Olympic obligations on human rights. The Committee to Protect Journalists said China was still impeding foreign journalists, and jailing domestic ones, despite promises to allow unfettered reporting. Reporters Without Borders managed to stage a protest in Beijing, only to see the police briefly detain the foreign journalists covering it.
 Lhadon Tethong, an advocate for Tibetan independence, said she thought the Olympics might finally have created some space for open dissent in China. She flew to Beijing from New York and spent countdown week filing updates on her Tibet blog. She went to the hotel where Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, was staying and shouted out questions about Tibet. The police later confronted her with printed pages of her blog and deported her to Hong Kong. She said the protesters who had hung the Tibet banner on the Great Wall were deported on the same plane.
 ''In the end, we weren't surprised they got us kicked out because we know they are not open and free,'' Ms. Tethong said by telephone after landing in Canada on Thursday night. ''No I.O.C., no press and no Olympics are going to change the way they rule that place.''
 Mr. MacAloon, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Chicago, said the torch relay, which begins in March, could cause major political friction. Already, a dispute has broken out with Taiwan about how and whether the torch can pass through the island. Protesters are expected elsewhere along the international route, while controversy is erupting over plans to carry the torch through Xinjiang, a Muslim-dominated area of western China, as well as Tibet.
 Mr. MacAloon predicted that press freedom would become an increasingly prominent issue because it directly challenges the control that the Communist Party is accustomed to wielding. Tensions already emerged last week, and Mr. MacAloon predicted more friction if officials, for fear of bad publicity, refused to allow reporters to follow the torch through the restive regions of China.
 ''With Beijing, the issue has always been whether the Games, in the end, will be seen to further the process of reform and opening, or will the leadership become too worried and clamp down in ways that set back political and human rights progress,'' Mr. MacAloon said.
 Many dissidents in China say that the ultimate barometer of success is whether the Olympics force the Communist Party to further open up society and advance political reform. Hu Jia, a prominent Beijing dissident, said the party considered domestic dissidents, more than foreign protesters or advocacy groups, the most serious challenge to staging the Olympics. He said the Games had led the government to tighten its monitoring of dissidents, not loosen its grip.
 ''The reason for a 'politicized' Olympics lies with the Chinese government,'' Mr. Hu said. ''It's repressing dissidents and activists under the name of the Olympics. At the same time, it is trying to prove the legality and validity of its rule through the Olympics.''
 Mr. Hu should know. He has spent much of this year under house arrest.

HEADLINE: Things Fall Apart, but Some Big Old Things Don't

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A 40-year-old bridge in Minnesota collapses, an 83-year-old steam pipe in Manhattan explodes and three inches of rain immobilizes a subway system that goes back more than a century. 
 Makes one wonder: Is the country relying too much on decaying infrastructure, the capital investments of generations long gone?
 Maybe, but there is a good reason why big old things -- pipes and bridges, nuclear reactors and even spaceships -- stick around. In many ways, they are like your grandmother's dining room set: big, bulky and hard to remove. And in a lot of ways, it makes more sense to keep the old stuff than replace it with something from Ikea. 
 After the I-35W bridge collapse in Minnesota, many experts cited dire numbers to make the case that the country must start building anew. A quarter of the nation's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, they warned. And 1,500 bridges have collapsed since the 1960s. 
 But leaving aside bridges that were hit by trucks, ships or barges, or those weakened by water washing away the dirt under the foundations, events like the one in Minnesota are very rare, federal officials say.
 Indeed, old equipment is in routine use. Nuclear reactors that were built in Eisenhower's ''Atoms for Peace'' era, with a life expectancy of 40 years, have recently had their licenses extended to 60 years. And one member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is already talking about adding 20 years on to that. 
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sometimes points out that digging for what are now called the PATH tubes, which connect Manhattan and Newark, N.J., began in 1874, two years before General Custer died at Little Big Horn. 
 Generally, the bigger an object, the longer it survives, because it has economic value, and has usually become intricately connected to things around it.
 Replacing the Brooklyn Bridge, in service since 1883, would mean years of disruption, and the possible replacement of all roads that lead to it. The PATH tubes are still in place because they are still needed and because a new Hudson River crossing would cost billions. Replacing old nuclear plants would be similarly astronomical, even if the legal and environmental barriers could be overcome. 
 ''You cannot just replace the old stock with new stock, without changing a lot of stuff around it,'' said Viren Doshi, a London-based consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, who has studied the telephone and electricity industries. ''So they keep on patching up the old stuff.'' 
 In many ways, big old things are also more dependable. Air Force One is a Boeing 747-200. That model went out of production in 1991, but the Air Force prefers models that have already had the bugs worked out of them. 
 And technology can keep big old things working. Arguably, the heavy pieces of metal in some old hardware are safer now than when new, because they are inspected with industrial radiography, ultrasonic tests and other modern wizardry.
 Of course, there are several prerequisites for big old things to attain eternal life. One is knowing what you've got. For nuclear plants, that means counting how many neutrons have hit the reactor vessel metal, each one making the steel a bit more brittle. 
 Plenty of safety measurements were taken of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis. Technicians used modern diagnostic tools to look for cracks. But maybe they mismeasured or measured the wrong things. Or maybe the engineers in the mid-1960s, barely out of the slide-rule era, made an error then that doomed the bridge now. Eternal life also requires that big old things survive changes in the surrounding environment. Anything that sits around long enough will experience earthquakes, which weaken foundations. That is an early, and still possible, suspect in the Minnesota bridge collapse. 
 In the future, big old things may need to survive climate change, which some experts fear will produce more extreme weather, including droughts or deluges (although it may be hard to link climate change to any specific event, like the deluge in New York last week).
 Of course, not all big old things will survive. The utility industry has operated coal-powered generators that are more than 50 years old because new power stations are expensive. But now, with demand growing fast, the industry is proposing to build new coal plants with technology that will get more electricity out of a ton of fuel. 
 Airlines fly some very old airplanes, but new ones promise to save so much fuel that the old ones may be finally put out to pasture.
 Even NASA is finally moving ahead; its oldest space shuttle is 24. Its youngest is 15. A replacement is due soon.

HEADLINE: Millions Flock to Vote in Sierra Leone's Latest Step Toward Postwar Healing

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Millions of people lined up to vote in Sierra Leone in the first election since United Nations peacekeeping efforts ended two years ago, ready to choose the first new president since the country's brutal civil war in 2002 and close a grim chapter in the country's history. 
 Turnout appeared to be high as torrential rains that have drenched the country over the past few days eased, and voters waited in a light drizzle to cast their ballots for president and Parliament. 
 ''The real significance of this election is in its conduct and not really in its outcome,'' said Lansana Gberie, an analyst and author who has written extensively about the wars that have wracked his country. ''If they are peaceful and there is transfer of power with no violence, it shows that Sierra Leone has turned a corner.''
 The election is a bookend to a violent era that turned Sierra Leone, a hilly, palm-fringed country roughly the size of South Carolina on the southern coast of West Africa, into an indelible symbol of human brutality. 
 The war began in 1991, when a band of rebels led by a retired soldier and journalist named Foday Sankoh attacked from a jungle hideout in western Liberia. Trained in Libya's insurgent camps and backed by the Liberian warlord Charles G. Taylor, Mr. Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front unleashed a tide of death and misery that would leave hundreds of thousands of people homeless, maimed, raped or dead. 
 The war's signature atrocity -- the amputation of hands, feet and ears -- arose in part as a bloody answer to a campaign slogan in the 1996 election, when Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who was elected president that year and is to retire after this election, told his supporters that the future was in their hands. 
 Sierra Leone has made some strides since then. Its army and police force have been reformed from incubators of coup plots into instruments of order and public service. A few hundred miles of roads have been built, and 153 schools and 76 hospitals and clinics have been erected or rehabilitated. Special schools have been established to help students forced out of school by war, putting lanky teenagers into third-grade classrooms.
 Some of the men most responsible for the war atrocities -- recruiting child soldiers, rape, amputation and looting -- have been convicted by the international tribunal set up in the capital, Freetown, after the war. Mr. Taylor, the war's mastermind, is awaiting trial in The Hague after being arrested last year.
 But many of the problems that led to the war persist. The vast gulf between the richest citizens -- who control political power, and the country's diamonds and other resources -- and the poor masses remains larger than ever. Efforts to tackle endemic corruption have foundered as entrenched political elites have thwarted attempts to loosen their grip on the country's purse strings. 
 Most troubling of all is the country's huge generation gap. Unemployment among young people -- more than half of Sierra Leone's population is under the age of 35 -- stands at 80 percent. Of the 71,043 combatants who were demobilized in a United Nations-sponsored program that gave them cash and job training, only 42 percent found work, according to a survey of combatants in 2004.
 ''The peace dividend had not been delivered, and that is a source of instability,'' said Val Collier, former head of the country's anticorruption commission, who says he was forced out after trying to prosecute senior government officials. ''There is so much left undone, even now five years after the end of the war.'' 
 Unlike many African presidential elections, this one is highly competitive and no one is sure what the outcome will be among the three major candidates. The main political parties tend to fracture along geographic and ethnic lines rather than ideological ones. 
 The incumbent, Mr. Kabbah, is stepping down, and his vice president, Solomon Berewa, is running as his chosen successor on the platform of the ruling party, the Sierra Leone People's Party, which is largely supported by the Mende people. Charles Margai, the scion of a prominent political family, is hoping to win the presidency with a breakaway faction of the ruling party. Ernest Koroma, a respected businessman who lost to Mr. Kabbah in 2002, leads the All People's Congress party, which is largely made up of the Temne ethnic group. The winning candidate must win 55 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff. 
 ''For the first time there is serious competition between the ruling party and the main opposition parties,'' said Victor Angelo, the top United Nations official in Sierra Leone. ''It is very difficult to say who will win. This is a major test for democracy.''
 Marie-Anne Isler, the chief European Union observer, told Reuters that the vote appeared to be going well. 
 ''There are long queues throughout the country and the process seems to be well organized and peaceful,'' she said.

PERSON: Moe Fishman 

HEADLINE: Moe Fishman Dies at 92; Fought in Lincoln Brigade

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Moe Fishman, who as a 21-year-old from Astoria, Queens, fought Fascists in Spain with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and was severely wounded, then led veterans of that unit in fighting efforts to brand them as Communist subversives, died on Aug. 6 in Manhattan. He was 92.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Peter Carroll, chief of the board of governors of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives. 
 Mr. Carroll said that about 40 of about 3,000 American veterans of the Spanish Civil War volunteers are living. It had been the job of Mr. Fishman, as executive secretary-treasurer of the veterans, to announce deaths.
 At times he was almost alone in keeping the group going, Mr. Carroll said, particularly during the long, ultimately successful legal battle to remove the group's subversive label. Mr. Fishman put out a newsletter, kept scrupulous books, ran the office daily and spoke widely.
 In an interview with Esquire magazine in 1962, he said: ''I'm the organization. If there's something to decide, I talk it over with the guys and then decide what I'm going to do. Cockeyed, but that's the way it is.''
 The Spanish Civil War began in 1936 after Gen. Francisco Franco set out to overthrow the newly elected leftist government. Americans soon volunteered to fight Franco in what came to be called the Lincoln Brigade.
 It was actually a battalion. Officially, Americans joined it or the Washington Battalion. The two American battalions, which informally have come to be known as the Lincoln Brigade, joined with four other battalions of volunteers from other countries to form the XV International Brigade. 
 In 1937, Mr. Fishman was a high-school dropout working in a laundry and driving a truck. He was also a member of the Young Communist League, having joined partly to meet like-minded young women at dances the organization sponsored, he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2004.
 He also liked how the Communists responded when a family behind on the rent was evicted and thrown on the streets with its furniture. He told The Times that party members would use an ax or hammer to break the lock on the door and put the family back in. 
 Many believe that at least half of the volunteers for the Lincoln Brigade were Communists, but Mr. Fishman's reasons for joining were more complex, he told The Times in 1969.
 ''Why did I go?'' he said. ''That's hard to say. That's a key question. I was active in trade union work. I wanted to travel. I belonged to the 92nd Street Y.M.H.A., and we were very anti-Fascist, much opposed to Hitler, Franco.''
 He was born Moses Fishman on Sept. 28, 1915, and grew up in Astoria. On the day he was to depart for Spain, he left for work at the usual time to deceive his parents. Halfway down the stairs, he realized he had forgotten his toothbrush, returned for it and broke it in half so it would fit in his pocket. (It was the only thing he brought back from Spain, he told The Hartford Courant in 2000.)Mr. Fishman called his parents when he got off the subway near the dock, and they cried when he told them his plans. His mother had never seen his father cry. He himself was unafraid. ''When you're 21, there's no bullet meant for you,'' he told The Times in 2000.
 On July 5, 1937, during the Brunete offensive west of Madrid, a sniper hit Mr. Fishman's thigh, leaving 32 pieces of bone and metal. He spent a year in Spanish hospitals, and a pin was put into his leg. At one point the leg became infected, he told The Courant. He was then in and out of hospitals in the United States for two years.
 During World War II, Mr. Fishman was in the merchant marine. Afterward, he and other Lincoln veterans became involved in aiding refugees from Franco's Spain. President Harry S. Truman's attorney general labeled the veterans group subversive. In 1950, when such organizations had to register with the government, the entire executive committee of the Lincoln Brigade veterans resigned. Mr. Fishman stepped in to become secretary-treasurer.
 After a federal court removed the subversive label in the 1970s, Mr. Fishman wrote a colleague that the change might not be good. He wryly suggested doing something subversive so as not to appear irrelevant to rebellious youth. (Mr. Fishman later dropped his party membership, Mr. Carroll said.) 
 Mr. Fishman is survived by his partner, Georgia Wever, of Manhattan, and his sisters Lilly Litsky, of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Pearl Fishman, of Yonkers.
 He never tired of a lively demonstration. But he came to prefer sitting in a folding chair, as he did in 2004, when he hailed protesters at the Republican National Convention in Manhattan. When they saw his Lincoln Brigade banner, they applauded back. In an interview with The Villager, a neighborhood newspaper, he said, ''They come up -- these young girls -- they want you to take a picture with them and they kiss you.''
 Other late-life adjustments were harder. In 2001, an article in The Economist recounted how he stumbled over the word ''globalization'' at a protest against globalization. ''It was so much easier to say when we called it imperialism,'' he was reported to have said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Aug. 12 about Moe Fishman, a veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War, referred incorrectly to his high school education. He was a graduate of Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan; he did not drop out. (He later dropped out of City College, primarily for financial reasons.)

HEADLINE: Renovating a Building, and Perhaps a Suburb's Image

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES

DATELINE: EAST ORANGE, N.J., Aug. 11 

 BODY:
In the cold nomenclature of tax assessors and municipal records, it is known as Lot: 2, Block: 280, District: 5. 
 Before its once-proud apartments were abandoned to squatters and gangs, it was called the Mayfair, a label that now seems wildly out of place in this struggling city. Now the 15-story building, perched along the Garden State Parkway on the north side of town, is opening a third act with a name that is as simple as its plain brick facade: 60 -- as in its address on Parkway Drive East.
 After 45 years -- during which it has survived vandals, unpaid tax bills, graffiti artists, utility shut-offs and, according to lore, a glancing blow from a small plane -- the building that has been home to mayors and Crips alike is considered by many here as a symbol of the city's revitalization.
 Five years after the emergency eviction of 119 tenants, when the bankrupt condominium was without power and elevator service and smelled like rotting fish, it is undergoing a $15 million renovation and is to reopen around Thanksgiving. Units are priced from $99,000 (for a studio on a lower floor) to $350,000 (for a two-bedroom with a Manhattan view). 
 ''What we're trying to do is rebuild a community here,'' Chris McCloud, the site manager, said recently as she gave a tour of two-bedroom units to Karleen Kemp, a 32-year-old schoolteacher. 
 The Mayfair is one of about 10 major redevelopment projects in East Orange, where officials have cut the crime rate by more than half over the past five years. With the $6 million refurbishment of the old Suburban Hotel on South Harrison Street and the recently completed $17 million rehabilitation of another apartment building, Andrea Towers (now condominiums and renamed Empire View), there is a sense of momentum in this city of 70,000 people, about 12 miles west of Manhattan.
 To be certain, East Orange -- where the decline began after the Newark riots 40 years ago -- is still a long way from where it wants to be.
 ''There is much more that we want to do,'' Jose M. Cordero, the director of the 300-member police force, said in a recent interview. 
 As recently as five years ago, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics, the city was one of the most dangerous of its size. But officials say they have made strides in reducing crime. In 2003, for example, five cars were stolen, on average, each day here. This year, as the police have experimented with crime-tracking software, that figure has been cut roughly in half.
 Experts say the crime reduction and economic development mirror rebounds in other urban areas where gentrification efforts are under way, though they caution that it is too soon to tell whether the trend is sustainable here.
 ''The parallels would be to places like Brooklyn, where the locations were great but the communities were struggling until people figured out they could buy great houses there,'' said Leslie W. Kennedy, a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers University-Newark. He said revitalization is happening faster here than in Newark because of its smaller size and high-quality housing. (Newark, with a population of 254,217, is more than three times as large as East Orange.) 
 ''In East Orange, while the income levels dropped off, the housing stock didn't drop,'' he said. ''My guess is it makes a faster comeback. It's got the right location, and people are spotting it.''
 The people who spotted the potential in the old Mayfair were Mark Caller and Pinny Loketch, founders of the GLC Group, based in Irvington, N.J. Mr. Caller, whose company has tackled similar projects in Newark and Brooklyn, said that more than 2,000 people had visited the sales office since it opened last month. About 50 of them have reserved units with $2,500 deposits, though Mr. Caller acknowledged that a handful have asked for refunds because they remain unconvinced about the city's rebirth.
 ''This community has really been underserved for a long time,'' Mr. Caller said. ''We know that if we offer a quality product, people will respond.''
 The mayor of East Orange, Robert L. Bowser, said that the city had cast an especially hopeful eye on the 183-unit project. ''We expect this to be a real boost to the city, and not just from a tax perspective,'' he said. ''It will certainly improve the quality of life for people who live in the city.''
 Not everyone is pleased with the new and improved Mayfair. Low-income housing advocates question the wisdom of pushing projects that force longtime residents out of neighborhoods. While the prices at 60 are modest compared with housing costs in many New York suburbs, they remain out of reach for many residents of East Orange, where the median household income in 2005 was $29,691, according to census estimates. That compares with $46,242 nationally and $61,672 in New Jersey overall. 
 ''The purpose of redevelopment shouldn't be to get rid of your population and have a new, richer population move in,'' said Matt Shapiro, president of the New Jersey Tenants Organization. ''If you want to do redevelopment, you do it in a way that the people who live there now get to stay there, and you do that with housing that's safe, comfortable and affordable.''
 Mayor Bowser said that he understood such concerns but that the city needed more market-rate housing to build its tax base. In recent years, about 35 percent of the housing in East Orange was sold or rented at market rates; Mr. Bowser said the city wanted to push that figure to 60 percent. 
 Mr. Shapiro proposed that each unit of market-rate housing be matched by a unit sold or rented at a discount to low-income residents. 
 The old Mayfair opened in 1963 as a luxury rental building, one of many that dotted the city's broad streets. An ad that year in the local newspaper, The East Orange Record, noted that a two-bedroom apartment could be rented for $246 a month, roughly $1,600 in today's dollars. The mayor at the time, James W. Kelly, was among the tenants.
 ''I remember that he had satin walls,'' said Goldie Burbage, president of the Historical Society of East Orange. ''It was a wonderful building, just wonderful.''
 The grandeur began peeling away in July 1967, with the riots in Newark. ''That's when the downturn really started,'' Ms. Burbage said.
 Over the next two decades, the city experienced a seismic shift, with East Orange losing more than half of its white residents in the 1980s alone. In the 1970 census, minorities made up 54 percent of the city's population. Today, the minority population is nearly 90 percent of the total.
 The Mayfair turned condo in the early 1980s, but within 15 years found itself floundering in unpaid tax and utility bills.
 Deepak Chainani paid $9,000 for his one-bedroom unit on the first floor. He said that because the association did not keep sufficient cash reserves, it could not make even the simplest repairs or pay its bills on time. 
 ''Sometimes the elevators would work, sometimes they would not,'' said Mr. Chainani, who now lives Bloomfield, just north of here. ''They were trying to fix it little by little. The association couldn't keep up.''
 By 2002, the building was more than $300,000 in arrears to the utility company Public Service Electric and Gas. It was behind by more than a half million dollars on its water bill, and the association owed the city $2 million in back taxes.
 When utility workers cut off the power in September 2002 because of the unpaid bill, the city ordered the building evacuated. Tenants left trash piled in the hallways, and rats lived in the basement. ''It was a mess,'' said Mr. Chainani, who had by then rented out his unit but came back to collect some belongings. ''It smelled. There were things floating in the hallway.''
 Squatters took over, and the Mayfair was reduced to a 15-story eyesore, with blackened windows and dirty mattresses on the balconies.
 ''Every time I would drive past, I would be sad,'' Mr. Chainani said.
 About five years ago, the GLC Group began buying units from owners. The renovation began in earnest about two years ago, although GLC is still negotiating with a handful of the owners.
 When completed, the developers say, 60 will have 24-hour security, state-of-the-art appliances in each unit and an exercise room. But there are still glimpses of the rough past: A swimming pool has been filled with asphalt. And graffiti in the basement bears witness to former residents: ''Crip for life,'' reads one tag near a bank of elevators, although someone has drawn an arrow and added, ''Stupid for life.''
 Last week, Ms. McCloud, the site manager, was showing units to Ms. Kemp, a teacher who lives in Union. Ms. Kemp said that she would not have considered buying in East Orange a few years ago because of the crime.
 Of the 60 project, Ms. Kemp said, ''I feel secure here even though it's in East Orange.''

HEADLINE: Ohio Pushes Added Leave For Maternity

BYLINE: By BOB DRIEHAUS

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
The Ohio Civil Rights Commission is pushing for a broad expansion of benefits for pregnant workers.
 If its proposals are adopted, Ohio would join 18 states that require employers to offer maternity leaves that exceed those mandated by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. That law offers workers at businesses with 50 or more employees 12 weeks of unpaid leave for infant care. 
 Expectant mothers must have worked for a business for a year, or 1,250 hours, to be eligible.
 The Ohio commission has proposed that businesses with four or more employees offer 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave to pregnant employees, regardless of how long they have worked for the businesses. 
 Workers not eligible under the federal law would need a doctor's orders to qualify.
 The commission is revising its proposal after business groups said the rules would hurt small businesses and the state's economy. The revisions are expected to go next month to a State Senate and House committee that could approve the rules without further action by the Legislature.
 Jeanine P. Donaldson, who this year became the first woman to lead the commission, said the law on maternity leave needed to ensure that more women were protected against discrimination.
 Ms. Donaldson said she was willing to bend on the number of weeks of guaranteed leave but hoped to preserve the stipulation that length of service would not affect eligibility. 
 ''I don't think a woman can decide when to get pregnant,'' Ms. Donaldson said. ''To choose motherhood over livelihood, I don't think that is what the legislators had in mind.'' 
 Business groups say the expanded leave would damage the economy. ''There's really no reason to change the current law,'' said Tony Fiore, director of labor and human resources policy for the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.
 Requiring small businesses to hold open positions would be a hardship, he said, as would the immediate eligibility for new workers at large corporations.
 Ty Pine, legislative director for the Ohio branch of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said the market was doing a good job of establishing reasonable maternity leaves for workers and businesses.
 ''We would like to maintain the current practice of reasonable time off without mandating specifically,'' Mr. Pine said.
