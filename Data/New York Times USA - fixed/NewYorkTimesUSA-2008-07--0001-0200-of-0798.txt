HEADLINE: Wounded Iraqi Forces Say They've Been Abandoned

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KAMBER; Medeeh Qasim contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Dawoud Ameen, a former Iraqi soldier, lay in bed, his shattered legs splayed before him, worrying about the rent for his family of five.
 Mr. Ameen's legs were shredded by shrapnel from a roadside bomb in September 2006 and now, like many wounded members of the Iraqi security forces, he is deeply in debt and struggling to survive. For now, he gets by on $125 a month brought to him by members of his old army unit, charity and whatever his wife, Jinan, can beg from her relatives. But he worries that he could lose even that meager monthly stipend. 
 In the United States, the issue of war injuries has revolved almost entirely around the care received by the 30,000 wounded American veterans. But Iraqi soldiers and police officers have been wounded in greater numbers, health workers say, and have been treated far worse by their government. 
 A number of the half-dozen badly wounded Iraqis interviewed for this article said they had been effectively drummed out of the Iraqi security forces without pensions, or were receiving partial pay and in danger of losing even that. Coping with severe injuries, and often amputations, they have been forced to pay for private doctors or turn to Iraq's failing public hospitals, which as recently as a year ago were controlled by militias that kidnapped and killed patients -- particularly security personnel from rival units. 
 No one knows the exact number of wounded Iraqi veterans, as the government does not keep track. In a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service, Maj. Gen. Joseph Peterson, the American commander in charge of Iraqi police training, said that in just two years, from September 2004 to October 2006, about 4,000 Iraqi police officers were killed and 8,000 were wounded. 
 That number does not include soldiers in the Iraqi Army, who are far more numerous than the police and, Iraqi commanders say, have suffered injuries at a far greater rate.
 In a February 2006 speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, the report states, Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the secretary of defense, said that Iraqi security forces were being killed and wounded at ''roughly twice the rate of all coalition forces.'' If that rate held up, the number of wounded Iraqi veterans might well surpass 60,000.
 Iraqi government officials say that the wounded are being treated well, and that a law providing for veterans' care is being drafted. In the interim, they said, wounded veterans will receive their full salaries from the Ministry of Defense.
 ''The wounded soldiers from the M.O.D. still get their salaries after the incidents, depending on the reports from the medical committees,'' said a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Staff Maj. Gen. Muhammad al-Askari. ''We are waiting for the Service and Pension Law for the veterans from the Iraqi Parliament, but they still get paid during that time.''
 The veterans interviewed for this article disputed General Askari's statement and said they were paid only a small fraction of their salaries, or nothing at all. They described the government's treatment of them as at best indifferent and at worst vindictive.
 On the day United States forces arrived in Baghdad in April 2003, Hussein Ali Hassan, a sergeant in Saddam Hussein's army, was hit by a tank round. With his legs crushed and burns covering much of his body, Mr. Hassan was taken to a Baghdad hospital, where his left leg was quickly amputated.
 But in the chaos that broke out after the fall of the Hussein government, the staff fled the hospital. ''The looters stole beds and ripped the pipes from the walls around me,'' Mr. Hassan said.
 His friends and family cared for him until the staff trickled back. Weeks later, after doctors told him the hospital was rife with infectious bacteria, his family hastily took him home.
 An Italian organization was arranging a visa so that Mr. Hassan could fly to Italy for care. But with violence rapidly mounting in the fall of 2003, the group closed its doors before the visa request could be completed.
 In need of more surgery, Mr. Hassan borrowed money and embarked on a series of operations at Al Jabechi, a private hospital in Baghdad, eventually spending about $13,000 of his own money, he said.
 ''I could have waited months in the public hospitals, and the care is very bad there,'' he said. 
 Mr. Hassan says that in the five years since he was wounded, his repeated requests for a disability pension have been ignored. Two weeks ago, however, he learned that he had been awarded a pension of about $165 a month for his 23 years of military service (though nothing for medical care and no acknowledgment that he is disabled, he said).
 Before the approval of his pension, Mr. Hassan says that he had heard only once from the government, when a health official solicited a $3,000 bribe to approve his travel to Germany for medical care. He refused the request. 
 He says it does not help his cause that he was a member of Mr. Hussein's Sunni-dominated army, anathema to the current Shiite-led administration.
 To repay his debts and support his family, Mr. Hassan has been driving a taxi, his walker clattering in the roof rack as he plies the streets of Baghdad. With Iraq's high unemployment rate, he considers himself lucky to have a job.
 With the uncertainty of government pensions and Iraq's desperate economic plight, some wounded security force members have stayed on active duty, knowing it is their only hope of making a living.
 Nubras Jabar Muhammad, a 26-year-old soldier, was shot by a sniper in May 2007 as he was on duty at a Baghdad checkpoint. He nearly bled to death, losing a kidney and part of his liver, while suffering damage to his right hand. His torso is scarred, and two fingers are locked in a permanent curl.
 He says he still has shrapnel lodged in his back, and rarely sleeps through the night. He has trouble digesting food. But the army refused him a disability pension, claiming he was able-bodied, and he was forced to return to active duty after nine months. He says he has already spent about $2,100 of his own money on operations, selling jewelry and a pistol to raise the cash. 
 Though he had instructions from his doctors to avoid standing for long periods, the army quickly returned him to checkpoint duty, where he is on his feet all day long in temperatures up to 120 degrees. ''I demanded that my superiors give me a desk job,'' Mr. Muhammad said. ''They told me if I keep complaining, they'll kick me out of the army.''
 Dr. Waleed Abdul Majeed, who has extensive experience treating wounded soldiers, says he believes that they are getting adequate care. But he concedes that they have to wait for it, in part because three military medical centers under the Hussein government have been closed. 
 ''Now the burden is on civilian hospitals,'' he said. ''It would be better if we had a military hospital. The soldiers are taken good care of in the beginning, but there is no follow-up.'' 
 But with many physicians having been driven away by sectarian militias, there may not be enough competent doctors remaining to staff the hospitals. ''At least 25 percent of our doctors have left the country,'' Dr. Majeed said. ''I see 120 to 150 patients in a day; 30 to 40 need operations every week, so they just have to wait. And prosthetics is a big problem. The Ministry of Health does not have the specialized equipment for this.''
 Before the American troop increase, which contributed to improved security in Baghdad, many hospitals were controlled by armed factions that tortured and assassinated members of the security forces in their beds. 
 Nubras Jabar Muhammad, the sniper victim who was forced to return to duty, fled a public hospital that was controlled by the Mahdi Army militia of the rebel Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. 
 ''They would come in the night and give you injections to kill you,'' he said. ''I was scared of being murdered, so I left.'' 
 Hussein Ayad Ali was a 22-year-old member of a Judicial Police commando unit in 2005 when shrapnel from a grenade ripped into his legs and stomach. Soon after, his new battalion commander saw a note in Mr. Ali's file about a fight he had as a 16-year-old. As he lay at home recovering from his wounds, Mr. Ali says, he was notified that he had been fired because of his ''criminal background.'' 
 ''The army knew about this all along,'' he said of the fight. ''I told them when I signed up, but only after I was wounded did they kick me out.'' 
 Despite what they have suffered, most of the veterans interviewed said they were proud of their military service. ''I consider my injury an honor,'' said Mr. Ameen, the paraplegic army veteran. ''I am only sorry the government does not pay attention to us.''
 Just half a mile down the street, Col. Ali Farhan shows up each morning at his police station, even though he lost his left leg below the knee from a bomb explosion in November 2006. 
 Well connected, he was able to remain on active duty rather than try to scrape by on a disability pension of $200 a month, a third his regular salary. He says he works partly for the money and partly because he is proud of his contribution to Iraq, he said.
 But, he added: ''I lost a leg and can barely walk. I see on TV in the U.S. they lose two legs and they are running races. Why don't they do the same for us in Iraq?''

HEADLINE: North Korea to Widen Access for Aid Workers; U.S. Ship Arrives

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
A United States freighter began unloading tons of American wheat in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Monday, as the government agreed to give international aid workers unprecedented access to its isolated, hunger-stricken territory, the United NationsWorld Food Program said. 
 The shipment is the first installment of 500,000 tons in promised American aid to be distributed by the World Food Program and American groups like Mercy Corps. The aid, and the North Korean agreement to invite 50 more food program experts and a consortium of American relief agencies, followed recent progress in efforts to end the North's nuclear weapons program. 
 ''To some degree, this agreement is part of a greater openness by North Korea, and that certainly is demonstrated in this agreement,'' said Paul Risley, a Bangkok-based spokesman for the food program, which, with 10 foreign staff members in North Korea, is the largest international aid group there. 
 The wheat shipment arrived just days after North Korea delivered a long-delayed nuclear declaration on Thursday. In exchange, Washington said it would lift some economic sanctions and remove the country from a State Department list of state sponsors of terrorism. The North then blew up the cooling tower at its nuclear complex at Yongbyon, the most visible symbol of its weapons program.
 After sailing for several weeks from the West Coast of the United States, the American-flagged motor ship Baltimore arrived in Nampo, the North's main port, on Sunday evening. On Monday, it began unloading half of its cargo of 37,000 tons of wheat, Mr. Risley said. The ship will discharge the other half of its cargo at Hungnam and Chongjin, ports on the North's eastern coast. 
 North Korea agreed on Friday to allow the food program to use the largest number of international workers it has been allowed since it began operations there in 1996, during a famine that eventually killed an estimated two million people.
 For years, the World Food Program has asked North Korea for more access, believing that far more than the 1.2 million people currently being fed by the agency were in dire need. But North Korea has guarded its people from contact with outside aid workers. 
 However, the North seems headed toward a major food crisis. Two consecutive years of bad harvests and rising grain prices are making it harder for the impoverished North to import food, and assistance from South Korea and China, traditionally its most generous aid providers, is dwindling.
 Aid groups have issued increasingly dire warnings. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said the country faced a grain shortfall of more than 1.5 million tons, the largest since 2001. 
 Domestic prices for rice, wheat, corn and potatoes have doubled or tripled in recent months, the World Food Program said.
 Until now, the program has had access to only 50 of North Korea's 200 counties. Under the new agreement, it will have access to 128 counties, including the traditionally deprived northeast region.

HEADLINE: At Midyear, the Economic Pain Persists

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Many policy makers and bankers said this credit mess was contained.
 Boy, were they wrong. More than a year after the crisis first flared, the financial industry, and with it the broader economy, seems to be caught in a vicious circle. 
 As home prices sink, people are falling behind on their mortgages in growing numbers. As more homeowners run into trouble, banks must write off even more loans. And as the bad loans mount, financial companies are increasingly unable or unwilling to extend credit, making it even harder to buy homes or expand businesses. 
 This process is playing out painfully on Wall Street, where on Monday the stock market rounded out its worst 12-month run since the spring of 2003, when the United States invaded Iraq and the market was beginning a tenuous recovery from the bursting of the technology bubble. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 12.8 percent for the first half of the year. The index just had its worst June (down 8.6 percent) since 1930 (down 16.5 percent). 
 The Dow Jones industrial average is off 14.4 percent for the first half of the year. Financial shares keep falling. Even as the broader market posted a small gain on Monday, shares of banks and brokerage firms in the S.& P. 500 fell 2.1 percent, to a five-year low. 
 Lehman Brothers, which has been struggling to persuade investors that it can survive as an independent firm, fell 11 percent Monday, bringing its loss for the year to nearly 70 percent.
 ''Eventually, the financial sector's troubles will be communicated to the rest of the economy,'' said Douglas M. Peta, market strategist at J.& W. Seligman and Company in New York. ''As there is less investment available that restrains consumer spending, it restrains corporate spending.''
 One measure already signals that the woes of the financial system are straining the economy. In the last 13 weeks, total bank loans, leases and securities holdings have fallen at an annual rate of 9.1 percent, its fastest decline since 1973, when the data was first collected, according to Jan Hatzius, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs.
 Even as the Federal Reserve and the government have tried to reinvigorate the economy with lower short-term interest rates and tax rebates, rates on mortgages and corporate loans have climbed to their highest levels this year. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate home loan was 6.45 percent last week, up from 6 percent at the start of the year. Investment-grade corporate bonds are yielding 6.2 percent, up from 5.7 percent at the start of the year.
 Until recently, ''we haven't had the sense that we had the downward spiral in anything other than housing,'' said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, a bond-trading firm based in Burlington, Vt. ''What I am worried about is that we are headed in a direction where those negative feedback loops expand and intensify.''
 That cycle will not be broken, Ms. Caron and other analysts say, until the decline in home prices slows significantly or ends, allowing the market to tally the full cost of the recent credit binge and restoring confidence among bankers and investors.
 Some analysts see tentative signs that the fall in housing may be ebbing. Sales of existing homes have flattened in recent months and home prices fell a little less in April than they did in March on a month-over-month basis. But both trends could easily reverse, as they have after previous upswings.
 ''We could reach a bottom in housing at the end of this year and have some growth in the second half of 2009,'' Ms. Caron said, ''but that requires the economic backdrop to remain no worse than it currently is.''
 Another strain on the economy and markets is the rapidly rising prices for energy, food and other commodities. Crude oil prices are up about 51 percent this year and corn prices are up 55 percent.
 That surge in raw materials is one reason that fast-growing markets like China and India -- which are increasingly dependent on energy imports -- have taken a beating in recent months. The Shanghai stock market is down 48 percent for the year, and the Nifty index in India is down 34 percent. By contrast, markets in Russia and Brazil, which are big exporters of commodities, are essentially flat for the year.
 ''The emerging markets are associated with higher commodity prices, but not all emerging markets are beneficiaries,'' said Simon Hallett, chief investment officer of Harding Loevner Management, an investment firm based in Somerville, N.J. ''Russia and Brazil are commodity producers, but China and India are commodity consumers.''
 For the American markets, the rise in prices is certainly important, but spending on energy and food makes up a relatively small part of the average family's income.
 Much more important, analysts say, is the ability to borrow money to buy homes and expand businesses. 
 In addition to paying higher interest rates, borrowers are also dealing with more restrictive lending standards. Recently, Fannie Mae, for instance, tightened its rules for real estate investors buying multiple homes, which the owners typically rent out. In the past, the company allowed investors to borrow against up to 10 properties. Now, it limits them to four.
 ''That immediately knocked out a large supply of people who were prepared to buy these homes,'' said Lou Barnes, a mortgage broker based in Boulder, Colo., referring to foreclosed or vacant homes. He added, ''The main reason for suppressed prices of homes is the difficulty of financing them.''
 Those tougher conditions may remain in place for a while. The financial system is being forced to undo the excesses of recent years and return to a more sustainable level of debt in the economy, said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, an investment firm in New York. 
 For instance, the percentage of equity Americans have in their homes fell below 50 percent for the first time last year, from more than 60 percent in the early 1990s. In the first quarter, homeowners' equity had dwindled to 46.2 percent.
 ''This is not just another cycle,'' Mr. Stern said. ''It's the end of a period of rampant leverage and lax lending standards, and that takes a bit of time to work through.''

HEADLINE: Enabling Mr. Mugabe

 BODY:
Robert Mugabe brazenly and brutally stole his latest re-election as president of Zimbabwe. Now Africa's leaders, who have looked the other way for far too long, must decide what they will do. 
 They can continue to enable Mr. Mugabe out of political cynicism or misplaced solidarity with a former liberation leader turned tyrant. Or they can follow the wiser example of the living symbol of African liberation, Nelson Mandela, who last week condemned Zimbabwe's ''tragic failure of leadership.'' 
 The signals from Monday's opening session of the African Union summit, with Mr. Mugabe smugly in attendance, were not encouraging. While African election monitors rightly denounced the voting, few summit speakers went beyond muted and indirect criticism. 
 More than truth telling is at stake. Zimbabwe and its people are dying at Mr. Mugabe's hand -- ravaged by an imploding economy, skyrocketing inflation, man-made famine and a governmental machinery whose only visible function is to reward the dictator's collaborators and cronies and beat and kill his critics and opponents. 
 Zimbabwe needs a transitional government that reflects the true will of its voters, who gave a convincing first-round victory to the opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai. And it needs a fair rerun of the election. 
 Africa's leaders are best placed to keep Zimbabwe from further destabilizing the whole region. They can do so by refusing to recognize Mr. Mugabe's election theft and by pressuring those who continue to collaborate with him by denying them visas, freezing bank accounts and calling on the rest of the world to follow suit. 
 While far too many African leaders -- most notably President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa -- refuse to accept that responsibility, the United States and other Western countries have taken the lead. 
 President Bush has extended unilateral sanctions against Zimbabwean officials. The United States is pressing the United Nations Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and sanctions on Mr. Mugabe's cronies. 
 Unfortunately, Russia, China and South Africa seem determined to block such moves. 
 That is yet another reason Africa's other leaders must take the lead. They must speak the truth about Mr. Mugabe and all the horrors he has visited on Zimbabwe, back their words with sanctions and call on the Security Council to do the same.

HEADLINE: Budget Pain Hits States, With Relief Not in Sight

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Squeezed by high inflation, dwindling tax revenues and a national economic downturn, states from coast to coast have struggled to close yawning budget gaps while bracing for another difficult fiscal year, which in most states begins Tuesday.
 State tax revenues, adjusted for inflation and tax cuts, fell 5.3 percent in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the same time a year ago, according to a report to be released Tuesday; it was the third quarter in a row that total adjusted revenue declined. The first quarter revenues were the weakest among states since early 2003.
 Sales tax revenues, the beating heart of many budgets, were essentially flat for the first time in six years. Corporate income taxes declined 5.1 percent from January to March compared with the same period the previous year -- the third straight quarterly decline. And 12 states showed a falling off in personal income taxes, though revenue from those taxes rose 4.4 percent nationwide. 
 Continued weakness in the national economy dims prospects for states in the near future, according to the authors of the report, by the Nelson A Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, which tracks state revenues.
 ''There are signs that the economic weakness is very widespread,'' said Don Boyd, a senior fellow at the institute's fiscal studies program. ''Between this past May and three months prior, a lot more states were declining, and we have not caught up with them in the data yet. 
 ''Many more states,'' Mr. Boyd continued, ''are having outright declines in their economies, and that is presumably a harbinger of budget problems.'' 
 Many state legislatures have been embroiled in pitched budget battles, with education, social services and fees in the crosshairs.
 The states with the biggest budget troubles are those where the nation's mortgage crisis has hit the hardest. 
 Among them is California, which faces a $17 billion shortfall. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to borrow against future proceeds from the state's lottery program to shore up finances. Mr. Schwarzenegger is battling both fellow Republicans, who would like to see more spending cuts, and Democrats, who are seeking to protect education and social services. 
 In Nevada, where the Legislature is not officially in session, Gov. Jim Gibbons, a Republican, called last week for state agencies to cut their budgets by 4 percent on top of $914 million in previous cuts in the current two-year budget cycle -- all toward closing a $275 million deficit. Layoffs are also expected.
 ''Revenues continue to decline,'' Mr. Gibbons said in a televised address, adding that for ''the first time in at least the past 30 years, the state will take in less revenue this year than it did last year.''
 The Arizona Legislature struggled to end its session as lawmakers wrangled over how to pay for capital improvement projects with a $2.2 billion budget gap that was enormous in proportion to the state's $9.9 billion spending plan. 
 States in the Southeast also felt a tremendous pinch. Sales tax revenues declined on average 3.8 percent in the region, which had 9 of the 23 states that posted such declines, according to the Rockefeller report. 
 For example, Kentucky has endured one of the largest budget problems in its history, and faces a $900 million budget gap over its next two fiscal years. While the Medicaid, K-to-12 education and corrections programs enjoyed modest increases, the majority of other agencies were forced to cut by 12 percent, said Mary Lassiter, the state's budget director.
 Ms. Lassiter said the state was unable to keep up with expenditures that began during the good times a few years back and, as the Rockefeller report cited for other states, inflation, particularly in gasoline prices, further hampered the budget.
 ''The same dollar is not buying as much, especially in the fuel area,'' she said. ''Many of our agencies have large transportation costs.''
 Tennessee dealt with its woes by offering a voluntary buyout package that it hopes will yield 2,000 fewer state jobs. April was the worst month on record for revenue growth in the state. 
 Unlike other economic downturns, when states were hurt by faltering corporate and personal income tax revenue, problems this time appear to be led by declines in sales taxes, prompted in large part by the issues with the housing market.
 This has been particularly painful for states like Florida and Tennessee that have no personal income tax and rely on people buying things. 
 ''We saw a problem with the sales taxes, and it just got worse,'' said Lola Potter, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration. ''Most people would agree that consumer confidence was down a bit. If they're not buying, we're not collecting the sales tax.''
 Other states, like California, have looked to their lotteries for revenue growth or borrowing; some, including New York, raised the tax on cigarettes. Many continued to be constrained by high Medicaid costs, even as they sought to increase access to health insurance. 
 Acrimony between the governor and the legislature has marked the budget processes in some states. In other places, though, elected officials have hunkered down to undertake the grim task of cutting. 
 ''This was one of the smoothest sessions I have ever been part of,'' said Ken Pruitt, the president of the Florida Senate, where $6 billion in cuts were needed to compensate for the hammered housing market. ''And a lot of that had to do with the cold hard reality of a tanking economy.''

HEADLINE: A View With Some Room

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
There is a new class of service emerging in the aircraft cabin. It fits between economy and business class, both in amenities and price. It offers a better seat, more legroom, priority boarding and fancier meal service than coach.
 The only catch is, you cannot find anything comparable on any American airline. 
 Although ''premium economy'' fares have been available on some foreign carriers for more than a decade, a handful have raised the ante recently by carving out a separate cabin in their aircraft for business travelers on a budget and leisure travelers willing to pay extra for a more comfortable flight. Demand for premium economy seats may actually be helped by the slowing economy as companies tighten their spending and restrict business-class travel. 
 Virgin Atlantic overhauled its premium economy service last year, the new British Airways airline OpenSkies started its prem-plus cabin in mid-June, and Qantas Airways and Japan Airlines plan to introduce their premium economy services on routes to the United States later this year.
 ''It's a smart business move because there's been what I call class creep on an airplane,'' said Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Forrester Research. ''What's now called business class is almost what first class used to be. So premium economy is more like what business class used to be back in the 1980s, akin in many ways to U.S. domestic first class in terms of legroom.''
 In fact, the economy cabin has fallen so far in travelers' esteem that OpenSkies is calling its middle cabin prem-plus -- avoiding the word ''economy.'' 
 ''It's not premium economy,'' said Dale Moss, managing director for OpenSkies, just after the carrier's inaugural flight landed at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York two weeks ago. 
 Describing the airline's prem-plus cabin, which has 28 seats with a roomy 52-inch pitch (the distance between the back of the seat and the seat in front of it), Mr. Moss emphasized, ''It's a business-class seat as opposed to a business-class bed.''
 The leather seat is 20 inches wide and reclines to a 140-degree angle (flat would be 180 degrees) with an adjustable leg rest and lumbar support. 
 OpenSkies currently flies one Boeing 757 aircraft between Paris Orly airport and Kennedy and plans to add five planes on routes from New York to Europe by the end of 2009. Prem-plus fares start at $1,650 round trip, including taxes and fees, through July 4 and then will rise to $2,256. 
 Although a 757 typically carries 200 or more passengers, OpenSkies has 82 seats, with 24 in business class and 30 in economy. But that breakdown may shift depending on customer response to each cabin, Mr. Moss said.
 Given the economy and the response to the premium economy concept on other carriers, this new middle class may have found its moment. Virgin Atlantic, which introduced its original premium economy product in 1992 when companies were downsizing after the Persian Gulf war, redesigned and expanded that part of the cabin last year.
 Chris Rossi, the airline's senior vice president for North America, said the airline has seen less corporate ''trading down'' lately, yet premium economy bookings have increased 20 percent over the last 10 months.
 Virgin Atlantic's premium economy seat is 21 inches wide with a 38-inch seat pitch and includes priority check-in, priority boarding and baggage claim, a preflight drink, an amenity kit and enhanced meal service. 
 British Airways also offers a separate premium economy cabin, called World Traveller Plus, which was introduced in 2000 and recently got a makeover with new fabric cushion and headrest covers and upgrades like noise-reducing headsets. Its seats are 18.5 inches wide with a 38-inch pitch. On both British Airways and Virgin, premium economy fares from New York to London start at $1,891, including taxes and fees.
 Across the Pacific, Japan Airlines and Qantas Airways both introduced premium economy cabins last fall, and plan to extend them to flights to the United States later this year.
 Japan Airline's premium economy service will make its debut on its Tokyo to New York route on Aug. 1, featuring a ''sky shell seat'' that reclines within a stationary hard shell to avoid encroaching on the traveler seated behind.
 In November, Qantas Airways will introduce its premium economy service to flights between Australia and Los Angeles. The new cabin is priced at about twice the economy fare and half of the business-class fare, said Lesley Grant, a Qantas group general manager.
 Frank Schnur, vice president for advisory services with American Express Business Travel, said the company has seen more interest in premium economy among its corporate clients, particularly since the beginning of the year.
 But carriers in the United States do not seem to be embracing the concept. While United Airlines has Economy Plus seating, it offers a few more inches of legroom than economy, but not the upgraded seat. 
 While acknowledging the financial challenges that American carriers face, Mr. Harteveldt attributed their absence in this arena to lack of interest in passengers outside the expensive cabins. 
 ''People will pay an above-average price for something that's tangibly better, so kudos to the airlines that recognize this,'' he said. ''The ones that don't are going to wonder, 'Where did my profitable customers go?' ''

HEADLINE: Midwest Business Activity Remained Weak in June

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
CHICAGO (Reuters) -- Business activity in the Midwest contracted in June for a fifth consecutive month but at a less severe rate, even as production and new orders both slipped, a report showed Monday. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago business barometer rose to 49.6 from 49.1 in May, and was the strongest since January.
 Economists had forecast the index at 48.0. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.
 ''The fact that we are hanging around 50 is consistent with an economy that is hovering right above recession level, but is not in a recession,'' said Mark Vitner, economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte.
 The employment component of the index rose to 46.7 from 41.2 in May -- also the strongest since January.
 Still, new orders fell to 52.0 from 56.1 and production was down to 45.1 from 51.5.
 ''On balance, results came in relatively mixed, contributing to a modest further increase in the headline measure,'' strategists at IDEAglobal in New York said. ''Most subcomponents remain weak.''
 Businesses face continued high input costs. The prices paid index slipped to 85.5 from 87.5, which was the highest since June 2006, and was above 80 for a fourth straight month.
 Many analysts consider the survey a factory report since the region is relatively industrialized, although service sector companies and nonprofits are polled too.
 ''It looks as if manufacturing in the Midwest is holding its own. The orders index was down a little bit, but still above 50 so it looks as if things aren't getting a lot better, but are stable at this point,'' said Gary Thayer, senior economist at Wachovia Securities in St. Louis.
 The barometer measures activity by companies based in the Chicago area, even if they have operations elsewhere.

HEADLINE: U.N. Personnel Increasingly Under Attack, Study Finds

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
United Nations personnel around the world are increasingly likely to be targets for attack because the organization is perceived by some as a tool of powerful members, rather than an unbiased advocate for all nations, Lakhdar Brahimi, a veteran diplomat who headed a global study on the security of United Nations staff members, said Monday. 
 The study, conducted by a seven-member panel that was organized after 17 United Nations workers were killed in a bombing in Algiers last December, concluded that neither individual staff members nor the organization had fully grasped the change in perceptions, Mr. Brahimi said. 
 ''All of us who work for the U.N., we continue to think of ourselves as good guys, and just because you have the flag, wherever you go you will be all right,'' he said. ''We need to realize that our flag is not enough protection.'' 
 On the Algerian bombing, the report said the organization's system as a whole and individuals in New York and Algiers were ''found wanting.'' Threats against the United Nations in Algeria came as early as 2006, the report noted, and the organization's security chief in Algiers raised concerns, but he made little headway with the staff in New York and lacked a working relationship with the Algerian government.
 Last week David Veness, the under secretary general for safety and security, offered to resign, taking responsibility for the shortcomings outlined in the report, which was delivered in early June. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accepted the resignation immediately. 
 Mr. Veness, the former head of counterterrorism in Britain, took up the United Nations post after the security department was formed in the wake of a 2003 suicide attack in Baghdad that killed 22 staff members, including Sergio Vieira de Mello, the head of the mission there.
 John Sawers, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, questioned Monday whether the security review had thoroughly examined the responsibility of the Algerian government in preventing the attack, particularly because Mr. Brahimi is a former Algerian foreign minister. 
 ''I am not sure that the choice of an Algerian to investigate a bombing in Algiers was ideally the best choice for getting the right balance between the responsibility of the Algerian government and the responsibility of the U.N. system,'' he said. 
 Mr. Brahimi said his mandate was to examine overall security and not to assign blame for the attack. Obviously things had gone wrong, he said, but the Algerian government had thought it had done a good job protecting United Nations personnel through a 15-year civil war where foreigners were often targets. 
 Mr. Ban, following a recommendation of the panel, has set up a separate group to examine responsibility for shortcomings within the organization. 
 Mr. Brahimi said the United Nations must explore how to publicly highlight its concerns about security in specific countries where it has personnel, given that such statements can have an economic impact.

HEADLINE: One Runner With Two Olympic Chances in 400

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

DATELINE: EUGENE, Ore. 

 BODY:
Erison Hurtault labored down the final straightaway in the men's 400-meter semifinals at the United States Olympic track and field trials, watching the top runners pull away and his goal of representing the United States slip away Monday night.
 But Hurtault already had a trip to Beijing assured. The country of Dominica, a tiny island in the Caribbean where his parents were born, will happily give him an Olympic berth even though he is a United States citizen who grew up in Matawan, N.J. 
 Hurtault, who graduated from Columbia University last year with a degree in economics, came into this Olympic year and decided to battle the strongest field of 400 runners in the world instead of simply taking a free pass from Dominica.
 ''I could give the trials a shot because I wasn't giving anything up by making the decision any earlier,'' Hurtault said. ''I felt like if I could make the final here, it would put me in a good situation to make the final in Beijing. That's the ultimate goal for me this year, get in that final and try to mix things up.''
 Hurtault's quest here faltered when he finished seventh in his semifinal heat. His time of 46.34 seconds was nearly a second slower than what was needed to advance to the final. The defending Olympic gold medalist Jeremy Wariner won the heat in 44.66, with the top four advancing. LaShawn Merritt finished second in 44.76. Reggie Witherspoon won the other semifinal in 44.99.
 ''It wasn't a good run at all,'' Hurtault said. ''I'm better than that. I'm disappointed.''
 Instead of running the finals here, Hurtault said he would now fly to Colombia to compete for Dominica in the Central American championships. He will race there on the Fourth of July.
 In the finals that took place Monday, Hazel Clark grabbed her third Olympic berth by winning the 800 in 1 minute 59.82 seconds. Alice Schmidt and Kameisha Bennett finished second and third, but because Bennett has not reached the Olympic time standard this season, she did not make the team. Nicole Teter, who was fourth, had reached the time standard this season and will take the third Olympic berth.
 Bryan Clay captured the decathlon title, setting a trials record with 8,832 points. Trey Hardee finished second and Tom Pappas finished third to make his third Olympic team.
 The men's 800 was a rousing event for the crowd at Hayward Field. Andrew Wheating, a sophomore at the University of Oregon, made a furious kick in the final 50 meters to grab second place, making the Olympic team to a huge roar from the fans. Nicholas Symmonds won the race in 1:44.10. Wheating's charge put him second in 1:45.03.
 Christian Smith and Khadevis Robinson both dived at the finish line as they battled for third, with Smith edging Robinson by six-hundredths of a second.
 Wheating, a 20-year-old from Norwich, Vt., had the crowd on its feet as he charged toward the finish line to make an Olympic team in only his third year as a distance runner. His high school, Kimball Union Academy, did not even field a track team.
 Hurtault comes from a background with just as little track pedigree. He came to Columbia with a modicum of success in high school, but he blossomed in college. He won the Ivy League championship at 400 meters all four years he was there.
 When he was done, he could have accepted a job at an investment banking firm in New York, where he had completed an internship. But he decided to chase a track career while he still could. He moved to Tallahassee, Fla., working two jobs to support his training until some Columbia alumni contributed money to help him train full time.
 He ran one of his best times, 45.73, at a meet in Tallahassee in April, and he thought he was prepared for some big runs here. Instead, he will turn to the country of his parents' birth. The twist is, Hurtault has been to Dominica only once, when he was 3.
 ''Running for Dominica is a great opportunity,'' Hurtault said. ''It's best for me to pursue for a long career and for this year, a chance to go to Beijing.''
 Other athletes with foreign ancestry have done the same thing, sparing themselves the grueling process of qualifying for the Olympics in the United States.
 For Hurtault, the choice was made for him on the final straightaway.

HEADLINE: Drug Arrests Were Real; the Badge Was Fake

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: GERALD, Mo. 

 BODY:
Like so many rural communities in the country's middle, this small town had wrestled for years with the woes of methamphetamine. Then, several months ago, a federal agent showed up.
 Arrests began. Houses were ransacked. People, in handcuffs on their front lawns, named names. To some, like Mayor Otis Schulte, who considers the county around Gerald, population 1,171, ''a meth capital of the United States,'' the drug scourge seemed to be fading at last.
 Those whose homes were searched, though, grumbled about a peculiar change in what they understood -- mainly from television -- to be the law.
 They said the agent, a man some had come to know as ''Sergeant Bill,'' boasted that he did not need search warrants to enter their homes because he worked for the federal government. 
 But after a reporter for the local weekly newspaper made a few calls about that claim, Gerald's antidrug campaign abruptly fell apart after less than five months. Sergeant Bill, it turned out, was no federal agent, but Bill A. Jakob, an unemployed former trucking company owner, a former security guard, a former wedding minister and a former small-town cop from 23 miles down the road. 
 Mr. Jakob, 36, is now the subject of a criminal investigation by federal authorities, and he is likely to face charges related to impersonating a law enforcement officer, his lawyer said.
 The strange adventures of Sergeant Bill have led to the firing of three of the town's five police officers, left the outcome of a string of drug arrests in doubt, prompted multimillion-dollar federal civil rights lawsuits by at least 17 plaintiffs and stirred up a political battle, including a petition seeking the impeachment of Mr. Schulte, over who is to blame for the mess.
 And the questions keep coming. How did Mr. Jakob wander into town and apparently leave the mayor, the aldermen and pretty much everyone else he met thinking that he was a federal agent delivered from Washington to help barrel into peoples' homes and clean up Gerald's drug problem? And why would anyone -- receiving no pay and with no known connection to little Gerald, 70 miles from St. Louis and not even a county seat -- want to carry off such a time-consuming ruse in the first place?
 Mr. Jakob's lawyer, Joel Schwartz, said that what happened in Gerald was never a sinister plot, but a chain of events rooted in ''errors in judgment.'' Mr. Schwartz said he believed that at least three Gerald police officers, including the chief, knew that Mr. Jakob was not a federal drug agent or even a certified police officer.
 ''It was an innocent evolution, where he helped with one minor thing, then one more on top of that, and all of the sudden, everyone thought he was a federal agent,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''I'm not saying this was legal or lawful. But look, they were very, very effective while he was present. I don't think Gerald is having the drug problem they were having. I've heard from some residents who were thrilled that he was there.''
 There were numerous arrests during Mr. Jakob's time in Gerald (the exact number is uncertain, local law enforcement officials said, as legal action surrounding the case proceeds), but Mayor Schulte said that Mr. Jakob had, in fact, gone to elaborate lengths to deceive local authorities, including Ryan McCrary, then the police chief, into believing that he was a federal agent -- with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Marshals Service or some other agency.
 In addition to having a badge and a car that seemed to scream law enforcement, Mr. Jakob offered federal drug enforcement help, Mr. Schulte said. (Local officials thought the offer must have somehow grown out of their recent application for a federal grant for radio equipment.) Mr. Jakob even asked Chief McCrary to call what he said was his supervisor's telephone number to confirm Gerald's need for his help, the mayor said. 
 When the call was placed, a woman -- whose identity is unknown -- answered with the words ''multijurisdictional task force,'' and said that the city's request for federal services was under review, the mayor said. Mr. Schulte said he now suspects that Mr. Jakob adapted the nonexistent task force name from the ''Beverly Hills Cop'' movies starring Eddie Murphy. 
 ''Not only were these officers taken in, but so was everybody else,'' said Chet Pleban, a lawyer for Mr. McCrary and the other two members of the police force who lost their jobs after Mr. Jakob's real identity came to light.
 Of the firings, Mayor Schulte said, ''Nobody wanted to, but the city's lawyer recommended it.'' 
 When residents first began noticing Mr. Jakob, he certainly looked the part. His hair was chopped short, residents recalled, and his stocky chest filled a black T-shirt he sometimes wore that read ''Police.'' They said he wore military-style boots, pants with pockets running down the legs and carried a badge (his lawyer said it was from a former job as a security guard in St. Louis). And his off-white Ford Crown Victoria was decked out with police radios and internal flashing lights, residents said. 
 He first came to town in January, his lawyer said, to meet Chief McCrary, whose experiences serving in Afghanistan Mr. Jakob had read about in a local newspaper. Mr. Jakob was considering contract work overseas, Mr. Schwartz said, and the pair hit it off. 
 Soon, the arrests began. Some of those whose homes were searched said they had been kicked in the head and had had shotguns held against them. Mr. Jakob, many said, seemed to be leading the crew of Gerald police officers. 
 ''He was definitely in charge -- it was all him,'' said Mike Withington, 49, a concrete finisher, who said Mr. Jakob pounded on his door in May, waking him up and yanking him, in handcuffs, out onto his front yard. 
 Mr. Withington said he had not yet been charged with a crime; Gary Toelke, the Franklin County sheriff, confirmed that no local charges had been issued against him. But the mortification of that day, Mr. Withington said, has kept him largely indoors and led him to consider moving. Since the search, residents have tossed garbage and crumpled boxes of Sudafed (which has an ingredient that can be used to make methamphetamine) on his lawn, he said, and he no longer shops in town, instead driving miles to neighboring towns.
 ''Everybody is staring at me,'' he said. ''People assume you're guilty when things like this happen.''
 When Linda Trest, 51, a reporter at The Gasconade County Republican, started hearing complaints from people whose homes had been searched, she began making inquiries about Mr. Jakob. 
 ''Once I got his name, I hit the computer and within an hour I had all the dirt on this guy,'' Ms. Trest said. 
 As it turned out, Mr. Jakob, who is married and lives near Washington, a small town not far from Gerald, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2003 when he owned a trucking company, and had, at 22, pleaded guilty in Illinois to a misdemeanor charge of criminal sex abuse of someone in their teens. 
 Since the 1990s, he had worked, at times, as a police officer in tiny departments in towns like Kinloch, Mo., and Brooklyn, Ill., though he never seemed to stay anywhere long and was never certified as a police officer in either Missouri or Illinois, his lawyer said. (Under some conditions, short-term employees with some departments are not immediately required to have state certification.)
 As in Gerald, he impressed some, if only at first. ''He seemed to have experience on the street,'' said J. D. Roth, the police chief in Caseyville, Ill., where Mr. Jakob was a temporary part-time officerfor almost two months in 2000. ''He walked the walk and talked the talk.''
 In Gerald, just a day before it was revealed that he was not a federal agent, the city aldermen voted to make Mr. Jakob a reserve officer; he wanted the designation, Mr. Schulte said, so he could enforce local ordinances, and he stood before the aldermen, hands behind his back, seeking the title.
 Mr. Jakob offered city officials three contact numbers -- his personal cellphone, a cellphone he said he used for drug informants and his ''multijurisdictional task force'' cellphone, Mr. Schulte said.
 ''It was the movie, 'Catch Me if You Can' all over again,'' said Mr. Schulte, referring to the 2002 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a master of deception. ''I'm telling you, with this guy, everything was right.''

HEADLINE: Where Did the 262,080 Minutes Go?

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON; Al Baker and C. J. Hughes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Up there at the top of the page, it says this is July 1, a Tuesday. That means that Monday was June 30, a momentous day: The last day of the first six months of the year. 
 That makes the first day of the rest of 2008 the perfect time to ask: How's it going? Are your New Year's resolutions shot to smithereens? Are you better off or worse off financially than you were at this time a year ago? Are the azaleas and rhododendrons more colorful than they were in 2007?
 There are lots of ways to measure six months.
 When it comes to midyear stock-taking among stock market types, there may be some grumbling. The Dow Jones industrial average closed on Monday at 11,350.01, down 14.4 percent for the year. Corporate types with ''finance'' or ''financial'' in their titles, as in chief financial officer, will start now preparing quarterly earnings reports and announcing them over the next few weeks. 
 City officials who are keeping tabs on the year will now update the figures. As of Monday afternoon, for example, a city Web site showed construction-related incidents, injuries and fatalities through April. But that was before the May 31 collapse of a construction crane on the Upper East Side, which killed two workers. (A crane collapse on East 51st Street on March 15 killed seven people.)
 The Police Department did its updating on Monday afternoon. Overall crime in New York City was down 2.98 percent through Sunday, compared with data from the same period of last year, the police said. But some categories were up, compared with the first half of 2007. The increase in murders, for instance, comes after a record low number of killings last year, and violent crime remained well below 1990s levels. 
 The police said there were 19 more murders in the first six months of 2008 than in the same period in 2007, an increase of 8.2 percent; 60 more rapes, an increase of 9.3 percent; and 431 more robberies, an increase of 4.4 percent. Decreases of large numbers in nonviolent crimes contributed to the overall drop in citywide crime. There were declines of 6 percent in felony assaults, 8.8 percent in burglaries, 7.8 percent in automobile thefts and 1.4 percent in grand larcenies.
 Monday was the end of the fiscal year in New York City, and it was a big day for check-writing as some New Yorkers rushed to get in under the wire with property tax payments. Shortly before closing time, a line of 50 people wended toward the cashier's windows at the Department of Finance, on the ground floor of the Municipal Building in Brooklyn. 
 The line was about four times longer than the line on June 30 a year ago, two security guards who were keeping their eyes on the crowd said.
 Many people in the line said they were there to pay their property tax bills, which were due by midnight. Some, like Abby Aarons, 45, a condominium owner from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, had procrastinated, but not for the sake of procrastinating. She said she has been spending more than usual on other things -- basics like eggs, cereal and milk, whose prices jumped in the first half of 2008. 
 ''Things have never been worse,'' Ms. Aarons said. ''That's why I put off paying as long as I can.''
 Rumblings -- 
 Time out. This is the midpoint of this story about the midpoint of the year. How's the story going? Are your expectations for this story shot to smithereens?
 -- of economic concerns echoed through other conversations about the first six months of 2008. ''Everybody's gas bill has tripled, quadrupled,'' said Jerry Tierstein, a semiretired cabdriver from Brooklyn. ''Older people, they had years to save a little extra money. Younger people, they're struggling, and a lot of people, they live for today only. We've got to get used to this new world we live in.''
 Jason M. Apfelbaum, the president and chief executive of Chef and Company, a caterer in Manhattan, said business from January through June was down 8 percent from the same period a year ago. But he is undaunted even though customers' budgets are tighter and they want more value -- and even though business was down 8 percent from January through June, compared with the same six months in 2007. 
 ''We've done 20 percent every year for the last six years,'' he said. ''Obviously the economy is different this year from last. But this is 2008. Our mantra in the second half is up 28 in 2008.'' 
 Russell Bellanca, the owner of Alfredo of Rome, a restaurant at 4 West 49th Street, was more upbeat. ''The other shoe hasn't dropped like everybody was expecting,'' he said.
 He said he had recorded a 9 percent increase over last year's January-to-June numbers. But the first half of 2007 was up 10 percent from the first half of 2006.
 The middle of the year is traditionally when new laws take effect. In Virginia, that means legalizing sangria served in restaurants. In New York, that means increasing the state tax on little cigars from 30 cents to $2.75 a pack and on smokeless tobacco from roughly 79 cents and ounce to 96 cents an ounce.
 Once June had given way to July, the second phase of the city health department's ban on artificial trans fats took effect. It required restaurants to get the trans fats out of baked goods, frozen foods, cannoli and doughnuts. (The first phase required them to get rid of oils and spreads containing trans fats.) 
 As of Tuesday, the Health Department will also start levying fines against chain restaurants that do not post calorie counts. This is the latest and potentially last step in the department's campaign to reduce obesity by increasing consumers' awareness of things like that 460-calorie banana nut cake at Starbucks. One person's indulgence is another person's diet wrecker.
 So what about those New Year's resolutions? Steve Schonberg, a public relations executive, said he had built upon the big changes he began in the last four months of 2007. It all started on Aug. 12, when he turned 26.
 ''I quit smoking,'' he said. ''I went on a diet. I said, 'I want to be under 200 pounds by New Year's.' I got to 185 by Jan. 1.''
 That led to another goal. ''In January I said, ''Working out is one thing, but what about sports? I always hated sports. What about running? Running is for people who like to go like a hamster on a treadmill.' But I decided I could try running in races, and I was accepted into the New York City Marathon, and I'm training for the marathon. 
 ''My next goal is, I'd love to do modeling on the side,'' he said. ''Guess what? Somebody approached me Sunday''-- at the gay pride parade -- ''and said, 'Would you be you interested?' ''

HEADLINE: Newark's Mayor Cory Booker at Midpoint

BYLINE: By RICHARD E. BENFIELD

 BODY:
Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, says he does not think about it that way, but there must be easier ways to make a mark in the world than by trying to turn around a troubled city. 
 Mr. Booker is faced -- right now, today -- with rampant crime, punishing property taxes and a burdensome legacy of municipal corruption. 
 Expectations were high when he came to office, not only because he was an attractive personality but also because his predecessor seemed incurably corrupt. His success depends partly on meeting these expectations. Judging by a recent interview in his spacious City Hall office, in which he exuded a sense of confident serenity, he thinks he can do so. But he says the job has turned out to be every bit as hard as he expected. 
 Mr. Booker reached the midpoint of his first four-year term today -- too soon to achieve the ambitious goals he set for himself, but not too soon for his constituents to grumble about his mistakes. 
 And there have been mistakes. In one particularly embarrassing episode, he failed to back up the highly regarded official he brought in to reform the police department at a critical moment when the official's prestige was on the line. And too often Mr. Booker leaves political details to his underlings, who botch them.
 On balance, though, his achievements have outweighed his lapses. According to the city's police department, crime is down. There were 25 murders in Newark the first five and a half months of this year compared with 46 for the same period in 2006. Over all, shootings are also down. Much of this can be attributed to the transfer of hundreds of police officers to nighttime duty (often against their wishes) since Mr. Booker took office.
 The mayor has also begun an intensive campaign, patterned after New York's, for private investment for parks; some 20 new or refurbished parks are scheduled to be completed by the end of his first term, giving youngsters and adults an alternative to Newark's gray, gritty streets. There have been no major scandals involving his people, a significant relief for a city where politicians and their cronies assumed that election to office entitled them to cash in. Property taxes have been stabilized. 
 Mr. Booker has eased city rules to allow for more housing downtown. He has attracted money from the Gates and other foundations for new charter schools, and he is working hard to bring in new business, despite the bad economy. The results of these efforts will not be seen for some time, but they are worthwhile nonetheless.
 As to Mr. Booker's personal standing, the results are mixed. He is popular among liberals outside the city and has support from the city's growing Hispanic population, the emerging white and black entrepreneurs who have opened restaurants and small businesses and the Ironbound section of town, which has Portuguese roots. 
 But he has yet to change the perception of longtime black residents, those who turn out in high numbers for local elections, that he is an outsider. He tried recently to get his people elected to several ward and district-leader positions and failed miserably. 
 Some of his supporters fear this may augur poorly for his re-election chances in 2010; and while Mr. Booker insisted in the interview that he would seek re-election and, if successful, serve out a second term, some fear that he will become discouraged and perhaps even leave for a position in a Barack Obama administration.
 His troubles with the old-timers lie at least partly with their fear that the city is changing and that Mr. Booker is speeding the process along. And that he is. Some cranes are already on the city's horizon, and Mr. Booker promises many more. The Prudential Center, which Mr. Booker initially opposed, has been highly successful. New residents, especially Hispanics, are continuing to move in. 
 Newark will become a different city whether or not Mr. Booker stays on. But Mr. Booker is the energizer and catalyst who can direct the change in a positive way. Newark has needed someone to do exactly that for a very long time.

HEADLINE: Scanning the Heart: Cost and Benefit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Weighing the Costs of a Look Inside the Heart'' (front page, June 29) highlights that some physicians' ethics are questionable, a phenomenon that seems to be on the rise.
 As a cardiologist, I put my patients' health above my financial interest, without exception, as everyone should. If one does not own the scanner, one makes $100 on a scan -- barely worth the time it takes to read it well. 
 The American College of Cardiology, together with other professional societies, has published appropriateness criteria for coronary CT that are reasonable and based on (still limited) research.
 Scanning asymptomatic patients is not appropriate, and puts our profession to shame when personal financial gain is so obvious. 
 Maybe it is time for a more comprehensive disclosure to patients about how much we are making on what tests, and the evidence behind it. 
 Benjamin Schaefer
 Bangor, Me., June 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 As a geriatrician and health services researcher, I believe that the demand for cardiac CT scans is a textbook example of gizmo idolatry, or the implicit conviction that a more technological approach is intrinsically better than one that is less technological. 
 Factors in addition to faith in innovation and economic incentives for gizmo purveyors encourage their use and include the common-sense appeal of gizmo, use of the technology as proof of physician competence, and protection against claims of negligent care, to name but a few. 
 The harms from gizmo idolatry are absolutely real: patients and the advancement of science are put at risk. Medicine, as a public trust, is tarnished. 
 New regulation is urgently needed to require clear proof of benefit before cardiac CTs and other gizmos are widely disseminated. Bruce Leff
 Baltimore, June 29, 2008
 The writer is an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.
 To the Editor:
 It is certainly true that coronary CT angiograms are overused and that perverse economic incentives that permeate American medicine contribute. But it is also true that overuse partly reflects the obtuseness of Medicare and commercial health insurers in failing to accept the enormous utility of CT calcium scoring, a low-radiation, cheaper test for which there is ample evidence of effectiveness in risk stratification of patients for coronary disease beyond smoking, cholesterol and blood pressure data. 
 Further, there is strong evidence of the utility and cost-effectiveness of coronary C.T.A. when used appropriately in patients with chest pain. 
 Nathaniel Reichek
 Roslyn, N.Y., June 29, 2008
 The writer, a doctor, is director of cardiac imaging at St. Francis Hospital.
 To the Editor:
 It is somewhat unsurprising that a highly lucrative technology is being deployed on large populations despite the lack of evidence that it actually helps.
 Our health care ''system'' delivers exactly what we seemingly have asked of it: greater numbers of more expensive procedures. At the same time, proven interventions, like prenatal care and screening programs, are underused or difficult to access because of the lack of competitive reimbursement. 
 While radical and complete health care reform may be too much to ask for, given the current political and economic climate, we should all be wondering why our federal dollars are paying such excessive rates that make these lucrative CT ''mills'' such a profitable proposition. 
 Further, we might wish to embrace the notion of an arms-length relationship between the ordering and performing physician, as there is ample evidence that self-referral does result in increased use of these technologies. 
 Howard P. Forman
 New Haven, June 29, 2008
 The writer, a doctor, is a professor of diagnostic radiology and public health at Yale University.
 To the Editor:
 You published an interesting article that showcases many of the problems consumers have getting adequate and reasonably priced health care. 
 But abuse of these specialized services is rampant.
 My 88-year-old mother is in an assisted living facility where the policy is to send a resident by ambulance to the emergency room in our city hospital if any cut results in bleeding or if the patient has a fever. Of course, the E.R. will then perform CAT scans and M.R.I.'s ''just to be safe.''
 What a waste of resources! The litigious society we live in creates so many of these problems because folks do everything they possibly can just to ensure that they won't get sued.
 Anne A. Cianni
 Stamford, Conn., June 29, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The cost of a CT scanner to detect and diagnose heart disease: $1 million. The cost of health education to prevent the development of heart disease in those who do not have it and reduce the effects of heart disease for those who do: priceless. Peter Allar

HEADLINE: 'Oh Happy Day'

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It's getting harder and harder to remain deluded. With each day comes new facts to drag our heads out of the sand.
 Two weeks ago, The Times reported that four Western oil giants were on the verge of signing no-bid contracts that would return them to Iraq, the third-most bountiful petroleum playground on the planet. The deals, expected to be finalized in the next 30 days, were the kind of news that big oil lives for. 
 Giddy executives singing ''Oh Happy Day'' could be heard in the corporate offices of Exxon Mobil, Shell, Total and BP, which had been shut out of Iraq for three and a half decades. 
 We also learned this week that a group of American advisers, led by a team from the State Department, played a key role in drawing up the contracts between the companies and the Iraqi government. Chevron and several smaller oil companies are also on the verge of signing contracts.
 President Bush and Vice President Cheney, both former oil-company executives, have long tried to tell us this war was about terrorism, about weapons of mass destruction, about bringing freedom and democracy to the Iraqi people, about anything but oil.
 Said Mr. Bush: ''We cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.''
 He didn't wait. It didn't matter that Saddam Hussein posed no imminent threat to the U.S. Or that Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The troops were sent into battle in early 2003 and there is still, after more than five years and more than 4,000 American deaths, no end to the war in sight.
 One of the starkest examples of U.S. priorities came during the eruption of looting that followed the fall of Baghdad. With violence and chaos all about, American troops were ordered to protect one particularly treasured target -- the Iraqi Oil Ministry. As David Rieff wrote in The Times Magazine in November 2003:
 ''This decision to protect only the Oil Ministry -- not the National Museum, not the National Library, not the Health Ministry -- probably did more than anything else to convince Iraqis uneasy with the occupation that the United States was in Iraq only for the oil.''
 How convenient that the peculiar perspective of the oil-obsessed Bush administration can now be put to use advising the Iraqi government on its contracts with big oil.
 The contracts themselves are not huge. They are like the keys on a coveted ring that will begin opening the doors to Iraq's vast oil reserves. As The Times reported Monday, ''At a time of spiraling oil prices, the no-bid contracts, in a country with some of the world's largest untapped fields and potential for vast profits, are a rare prize to the industry.''
 A prize, yes. But at what cost?
 In addition to the terrible toll of Americans and Iraqis killed and wounded, the war in Iraq has diverted attention and resources from critical problems here in the U.S., where the housing market has been crippled, the stock market has tanked, gasoline has soared past $4 per gallon, unemployment is increasing and an extraordinary number of debt-ridden working families are staring into a financial abyss.
 Even as oil companies are enjoying staggering profits, many Americans -- in July! -- are already worried sick about the potentially ruinous cost of heating their homes next winter. 
 And then there's the so-called war on terror. 
 The latest news is that Al Qaeda, the terror network that actually did attack the U.S., has successfully regrouped in the tribal areas of Pakistan and has reconstituted its ability to institute terror attacks from the region.
 For an administration joined at the hip to the oil industry, the lure of Iraq's enormous reserves was stronger even than the impulse to conquer an enemy that murdered more than 2,700 civilians on Sept. 11, a toll greater than the number of Americans killed by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.
 Referring to Al Qaeda members who regrouped in Pakistan, The Times reported on Monday:
 ''Current and former military and intelligence officials said that the war in Iraq consistently diverted resources and high-level attention from the tribal areas. When American military and intelligence officials requested additional Predator drones to survey the tribal areas, they were told no drones were available because they had been sent to Iraq.''
 Who knows how long it will be before the U.S. disengages in any significant way from Iraq. What you can take to the bank is that this country will not make any major advances in energy policy, in health coverage, in rebuilding its infrastructure, in improving its public schools or in curtailing runaway public and private debt until our open-ended commitment to this catastrophic multitrillion-dollar war comes to an end.
 How long will it take before that finally sinks in?

HEADLINE: A Ragtag Insurgency Gains a Qaeda Lifeline

 BODY:
This article is by Souad Mekhennet, Michael Moss, Eric Schmitt, Elaine Sciolino and Margot Williams.
 NACIRIA, Algeria -- Hiding in the caves and woodlands surrounding this hill-country town, Algerian insurgents were all but washed up a few years ago.
 Their nationalist battle against the Algerian military was faltering. ''We didn't have enough weapons,'' recalled a former militant lieutenant, Mourad Khettab, 34. ''The people didn't want to join. And money, we didn't have enough money.''
 Then the leader of the group, a university mathematics graduate named Abdelmalek Droukdal, sent a secret message to Iraq in the fall of 2004. The recipient was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and the two men on opposite ends of the Arab world engaged in what one firsthand observer describes as a corporate merger.
 Today, as Islamist violence wanes in some parts of the world, the Algerian militants -- renamed Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- have grown into one of the most potent Osama bin Laden affiliates, reinvigorated with fresh recruits and a zeal for Western targets. 
 Their gunfights with Algerian forces have evolved into suicide truck bombings of iconic sites like the United Nations offices in Algiers. They have kidnapped and killed European tourists as their reach expands throughout northern Africa. 
 Last month, they capped a string of attacks with an operation that evoked the horrors of Iraq: a pair of bombs outside a train station east of Algiers, the second one timed to hit emergency responders. A French engineer and his driver were killed by the first bomb; the second one failed to explode.
 The transformation of the group from a nationalist insurgency to a force in the global jihad is a page out of Mr. bin Laden's playbook: expanding his reach by bringing local militants under the Qaeda brand. The Algerian group offers Al Qaeda hundreds of experienced fighters and a potential connection to militants living in Europe. Over the past 20 months, suspects of North African origin have been arrested in Spain, France, Switzerland and Italy, although their connection to the Algerians is not always clear.
 The inside story of the group, pieced together through dozens of interviews with militants and with intelligence, military and diplomatic officials, shows that the Algerians' decision to join Al Qaeda was driven by both practical forces and the global fault line of Sept. 11, 2001.
 Mr. Droukdal cited religious motivations for his group's merger with Al Qaeda. Some militants also said that Washington's designation of the Algerians as a terrorist organization after Sept. 11 -- despite its categorization by some American government experts as a regional insurgency -- had the effect of turning the group against the United States.
 ''If the U.S. administration sees that its war against the Muslims is legitimate, then what makes us believe that our war on its territories is not legitimate?'' Mr. Droukdal said in an audiotape in response to a list of questions from The New York Times, apparently his first contact with a journalist. 
 ''Everyone must know that we will not hesitate in targeting it whenever we can and wherever it is on this planet,'' he said.
 Interviews with American, European and Arab officials and a former lieutenant in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb indicate that more opportunistic factors were at play in the growth of the group. 
 A long-running government offensive against the Algerian insurgents had nearly crushed the group, officials said. They needed the Qaeda imprimatur to raise money and to shed their outlaw status in radical Muslim circles as a result of their slaughtering of civilians in the 1990s.
 The Iraq war also was drawing many of the group's best fighters, according to Mr. Khettab and a militant who trained Algerians in Iraq for Mr. Zarqawi. Embracing the global jihad was seen as a way to keep more of these men under the Algerian group's control and recruit new members.
 Then, in March 2004, a covert American military operation led to the capture of one of the group's top deputies. A few months later, Mr. Droukdal reached out to Mr. Zarqawi to get the man released. Mr. Zarqawi seized the opportunity to convince him that Al Qaeda could revive his operations, a former top leader of the Algerian group says.
 Just as the Qaeda leadership has been able to reconstitute itself in Pakistan's ungoverned tribal areas, Al Qaeda's North Africa offshoot is now running small training camps for militants from Morocco, Tunisia and as far away as Nigeria, according to the State Department and Mr. Droukdal. The State Department in April categorized the tribal areas and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb as the two top hot spots in its annual report on global terrorism.
 The threat is felt most acutely in Europe and in particular in France, which ruled Algeria for 132 years until 1962 and is a major trading partner with the authoritarian government in Algiers. 
 ''We're under a double threat now,'' Bernard Squarcini, chief of France's domestic and police intelligence service, said in an interview. ''A group that had limited its terrorist activities to Algeria is now part of the global jihad movement.'' 
 Last month, France signed military and nuclear development agreements with Algeria. Washington has also provided training to the Algerian military, and American companies have supplied equipment. 
 Even so, Western intelligence and diplomatic officials say the Algerian government has balked at making them full partners in investigating the group. Officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns.
 In Europe, the authorities are eyeing the Algerian group warily, but are not convinced that the group can strike outside Africa.
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said last week that the merger of Al Qaeda with the Algeria organization and others like it brought fresh risks. 
 ''These groups, as best we can tell, have a fair amount of independence. They get inspiration, they get sometimes guidance, probably some training, probably some money from the Al Qaeda leadership,'' he said, adding that ''it's not as centralized a movement as it was, say, in 2001. But in some ways, the fact that it has spread in the way that it has, in my view, makes it perhaps more dangerous.''
 Adopting Qaeda Tactics
 Last Christmas Eve, five French tourists from Lyon were picnicking in midafternoon near the town of Aleg in Mauritania, some 1,700 miles southwest of Algiers. Suddenly, they were ambushed by three men in a black Mercedes. One of the gunmen turned an AK-47 on the tourists, killing four and wounding the fifth, French investigators said. 
 ''It was total horror,'' said Francois Tollet, 74, a retired chemist who lost his two sons, a brother and a friend in the attack. He survived when the body of one of his sons fell on him. The gunmen fled across Senegal and Gambia before they were captured in an operation directed by French intelligence in Guinea-Bissau; agents determined that the men belonged to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. (Maghreb refers to the western edge of the Arab world.) 
 The attack reflected what officials and militants say are the group's tentacles in the northern tier of Africa. Camps in Mali, for example, are being used to begin operations in Algeria and Mauritania, according to French intelligence.
 Mr. Droukdal described a growing network of militants only partly controlled by his far-flung deputies -- the kind of autonomous jihad cells that counterterrorism officials say are particularly hard to combat. His comments to The Times included an audio file that was verified by a private voice expert who works for federal agencies. The Times also reviewed a set of 12 photographs sent by the group to verify Mr. Droukdal's identity.
 Asked about the slayings in Mauritania, he said, ''The brothers implementing the process are connected with us, and we have previously trained some of them, and we offer them adequate support for the implementation of such operations.''
 The epicenter of the group remains in the hills east of Algiers, where the roads are blocked by skittish police officers who finger their rifle triggers when cars approach. ''Who told you to get out of the car?'' a checkpoint officer yelled at one driver, backing away as the other guards swung their weapons into the faces of the passengers.
 Inside police headquarters in nearby Naciria, the commander said he was so busy battling militants that he had no time to hang photographs of three officers killed in recent suicide bombings. ''These terrorists don't know any mercy,'' he said. ''This is Al Qaeda, what do you think?''
 Even as the group expands its ambitions beyond Algeria, parts of the country remain a bleak battleground between militants and an oppressive government that follows its citizens and limits political opposition.
 The Algerian government killed or captured an estimated 1,100 militants last year -- nearly double the number in 2006, according to the State Department. But the group has begun using sophisticated recruitment videos to replenish its ranks with a new generation of youth that the State Department says is ''more hard-line.'' 
 The group has also benefited from a national amnesty program. Wanted posters at police stations and checkpoints include numerous men who were pardoned and released only to join the new Qaeda franchise.
 American military officials estimate that the group now has 300 to 400 fighters in the mountains east of Algiers, with another 200 supporters throughout the country. Led by Mr. Droukdal, 38, an explosives expert who joined the insurgency 12 years ago, the group has shifted to tactics ''successfully employed by insurgents and terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan,'' according to the State Department.
 In adopting these Qaeda-style tactics, it staged at least eight suicide bombings with vehicles last year, including two sets of attacks in central Algiers on the 11th of April and December, dates that now fill Algerians with dread. It dispatched the country's first individual suicide bomber, who singled out President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria. 
 The group has also stepped up its use of remote-controlled roadside bombs, and there are increasingly deadly clashes with militias armed by the government to fight the militants.
 ''We don't arrest them anymore,'' said Mohammad Mendri, 65, the mayor of a village who leads a militia near the coastal city of Jijel. ''We just kill them.''
 Its list of Western targets is growing. In December 2006, militants bombed a bus carrying workers with an affiliate of Halliburton, an American oil services company. 
 Other attacks killed Russian and Chinese workers. North African men trained in the group's camps shot at the Israeli Embassy in Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott. The group is also holding two Austrian tourists whom they kidnapped in Tunisia in February.
 Its most audacious attack came last December when suicide bombers struck the United Nations and court offices in Algiers, killing 41 people and injuring 170 others. The attack drew praise from Mr. bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, who compared it to the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad by Mr. Zarqawi. 
 A Merger's Rocky Start
 The on-and-off relationship between Al Qaeda and the Algerian militants began more than a decade ago. In 1994, Mr. bin Laden was looking for a new base to set up operations for his fledgling group. Algeria, with its rugged terrain and proximity to Europe, was an ideal spot. 
 Already, some 1,500 Algerian Islamists had returned home after helping the C.I.A. force the Soviets from Afghanistan. The men helped form a coalition of militants called the Armed Islamic Group. They took up arms in the insurgency against Algeria's military-backed government in a conflict that has left more than 100,000 dead. 
 Mr. bin Laden, in Sudan at the time, asked the militants to let him move to a mountainous area they controlled, according to Mr. Khettab, the former top militant leader. J. Cofer Black, who was stationed in Khartoum for the C.I.A., said he never heard this account, but found it plausible. ''We knew he was looking for some place to go,'' Mr. Black said.
 Mr. Khettab said the militants turned down Mr. bin Laden. ''We refused, and said we don't have anything to do with anything outside,'' he said. ''We are interested in just Algeria.''
 The West was already deeply concerned about the rise of radical Islam in Algeria. In 1991, an Islamic political party trounced Algeria's secular government in national polling, and the Algerian military blocked the elections. 
 Moderate Arab states, along with Europe and Washington, feared the installation of a fundamentalist Islamic republic on the model of Iran or Sudan and backed the government.
 The crisis escalated further when violence spread to Europe. In late 1994, Armed Islamic Group gunmen hijacked an Air France jet bound for Paris intending to use it as a missile before they were killed during a stop in Marseille, according to French security officials. The following summer, three Paris bombings killed eight people and injured dozens. 
 Algeria's military turned to infiltrators to help defeat the group from within, according to accounts from three high-level defectors from the Algerian Army and security service. Several massacres of villagers, for which the Islamic group was blamed, were believed to have been arranged by the military. 
 Even Mr. bin Laden and his backers denounced civilian killings as counterproductive to their cause, and the group withered. In 1998 a faction of militants created a new organization, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat.
 The new group revived the guerrilla war against the government, with minimal singling out of civilians, according to two United States Air Force officers at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., who analyzed 10 years of its operations through early 2006. Their study concluded that the group ''does not appear to be a 'terrorist' group as much as an internal insurgency against the government.''
 The Bush administration took a different view of the group. On Sept. 23, 2001, President Bush included it on a list of organizations that ''commit, threaten to commit or support terrorism.'' 
 Shifting Strategies
 The terrorist designation rankled Salafist group members, but there was dissent over whether to stay focused on the fight with the Algerian government. Two years later, the group's leader, Nabil Sahraoui, issued a statement for the first time endorsing ''Osama bin Laden's jihad against the heretic America'' and expressing his desire that the group join Al Qaeda. By this time, a United States Air Force general had the Algerian group in his sights.
 ''Africa had emerged strategically to the United States,'' said Gen. Charles F. Wald, former deputy commander of the Pentagon's European Command, which had responsibility for Africa. ''A significant amount of our energy is going to be coming from Africa in the future.''
 The wide open spaces of the Sahara where arms, drugs and cigarette smugglers roam and tribal law reigns were also seen as potential jihadist havens. In March 2003, 32 European tourists were kidnapped there by one of the militant group's top operatives. 
 ''He was a very dynamic guy,'' General Wald said of the kidnapper, Amari Saifi, who is known as El Para. ''Could have played in a Hollywood movie. Handsome as hell. They'd take pictures of themselves out there posing.''
 El Para got as much as $10 million in ransom, and General Wald said he decided to give chase. He tracked him for months through the deserts of Mali, Mauritania and Niger.
 In early 2004, General Wald was hosting a meeting of African defense ministers in Stuttgart, Germany, when his aides saw El Para crossing into Chad. ''Right there in my office they negotiate a mission for the Chadians to go after these guys,'' the general said. El Para was captured in Chad in March 2004. 
 From their base in the mountains east of Algiers, militants were struggling on rations of beans and rice when news of the arrest came in. A strategy meeting was held on how to free El Para, according to a participant.
 The idea was to press the French government, which in turn they hoped could press his Chadian captors, the participant said. Mr. Zarqawi was seen as a possible cudgel. In the fall of 2004, Mr. Droukdal, the group's new leader, sent Mr. Zarqawi the message that was crucial to their merger. He asked if Mr. Zarqawi could kidnap French citizens to trade for El Para.
 ''Zarqawi said, 'No problem; we will support you,' or something like this,'' recalled the former group member who said he saw the message. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized by the group to discuss the episode. 
 Before the plan was set in motion, El Para was handed over to Algeria, where he was recently sentenced to death. Nonetheless, Mr. Droukdal ''kept in touch, and Zarqawi invited him to become part of Al Qaeda,'' the former member said.
 In his comments to The Times, Mr. Droukdal confirmed that Mr. Zarqawi played a ''pivotal role'' in the merger, along with other intermediaries. Mr. Droukdal explained his wrath toward the United States, saying: ''We found ourselves on the blacklist of the U.S. administration, tagged with terrorism. Then we found America building military bases in the south of our country, and conducting military exercises, and plundering our oil and planning to get our gas.'' (Navy surveillance planes have flown missions from the Tamanrasset air base in southern Algeria.)
 In January 2005, Mr. Zarqawi began including Mr. Droukdal in his public statements praising Qaeda leaders. Officials in Washington and Europe confirmed that American intelligence agencies intercepted the message that Mr. Droukdal sent to Mr. Zarqawi. 
 According to a senior intelligence officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, the initial contact with Mr. Zarqawi was followed by communications with North African militants who had risen to senior posts in Al Qaeda's central leadership. They included Abu Laith al-Libi, a Libyan militant killed this year by an American airstrike near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
 In September 2005, Mr. Droukdal declared France ''our No. 1 enemy, the enemy of our religion and of our community.'' A year later, the merger was formally announced by Mr. Zawahri, who said, ''Our brothers will be a bone in the throat of the American and French crusaders and their allies.'' 
 Expansion to Europe
 Last December, French officials arrested eight men from Paris suburbs and seized computers, electronic material, night-vision goggles, global positioning equipment, cellphones, weapons-making machinery and 20,000 euros, or about $30,000.
 Investigators said they believed that the men, both French-Algerians and Algerian passport holders, were sending logistical equipment to support an attack to Algeria. Whether or not the case leads to convictions -- six of the men have been released -- investigators say they viewed the arrests as the first concrete link they had found between France and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known by its initials as AQIM.
 The Spanish police said they made a similar discovery in June when they arrested eight Algerian-born men on suspicion of providing financial and logistical support to the Algerian group.
 European investigators are examining a group of Tunisians with alleged ties to the North African Qaeda operation who are suspected of running a fund-raising and recruitment cell stretching from Paris to Milan. So far, despite its stated intentions to strike Europe and the rest of the West, investigators say they see little evidence that the North Africa branch of Al Qaeda is exporting fighters and equipment for an attack in Europe.
 ''Their ambition is to attack in Europe, but I wouldn't hard-sell it,'' said Gilles de Kerchove, the head of counterterrorism for the European Union. ''I wouldn't say AQIM is poised to attack in Europe.''
 Although the Algerian government has been a ready trading partner with the West, it has been a reluctant ally in the West's effort against the Qaeda group. Algerian officials have declined to share key information on the United Nations bombing and have also refused to release the names of insurgents it freed from prison, according to American diplomatic and intelligence officials.
 The F.B.I. recently opened an office in Algiers in an attempt to foster improved information-sharing between Algeria and the United States, as well as France. ''We're trying to make this like an extended family,'' said Thomas Fuentes, the F.B.I.'s director of international operations.
 The tension between the Algerian government and its people continue. The government has reneged on public promises to spend more of its energy wealth on its unemployed youth who are prime recruits for Al Qaeda, according to American intelligence analysts. The Algerian government, which would not comment for this article, minimizes the threat. ''Terrorism has been vanquished, despite the sporadic manifestation we are facing up to in the most energetic manner,'' President Bouteflika told Reuters in March.
 But there is new evidence that Qaeda commanders see potential in its North African franchise. 
 Intelligence agents intercepted yet another message between headquarters and the Algeria branch this year. Mr. Zawahri sent Mr. Droukdal a private message, according to a top German intelligence official, noting that controversial Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad were set to be republished. He asked Mr. Droukdal to help in taking revenge.

DATELINE: NACIRIA, Algeria 

 BODY:
 Hiding in the caves and woodlands surrounding this hill-country town, Algerian insurgents were all but washed up a few years ago.
 Their nationalist battle against the Algerian military was faltering. ''We didn't have enough weapons,'' recalled a former militant lieutenant, Mourad Khettab, 34. ''The people didn't want to join. And money, we didn't have enough money.''
 Then the leader of the group, a university mathematics graduate named Abdelmalek Droukdal, sent a secret message to Iraq in the fall of 2004. The recipient was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and the two men on opposite ends of the Arab world engaged in what one firsthand observer describes as a corporate merger.
 Today, as Islamist violence wanes in some parts of the world, the Algerian militants -- renamed Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- have grown into one of the most potent Osama bin Laden affiliates, reinvigorated with fresh recruits and a zeal for Western targets. 
 Their gunfights with Algerian forces have evolved into suicide truck bombings of iconic sites like the United Nations offices in Algiers. They have kidnapped and killed European tourists as their reach expands throughout northern Africa. 
 Last month, they capped a string of attacks with an operation that evoked the horrors of Iraq: a pair of bombs outside a train station east of Algiers, the second one timed to hit emergency responders. A French engineer and his driver were killed by the first bomb; the second one failed to explode.
 The transformation of the group from a nationalist insurgency to a force in the global jihad is a page out of Mr. bin Laden's playbook: expanding his reach by bringing local militants under the Qaeda brand. The Algerian group offers Al Qaeda hundreds of experienced fighters and a potential connection to militants living in Europe. Over the past 20 months, suspects of North African origin have been arrested in Spain, France, Switzerland and Italy, although their connection to the Algerians is not always clear.
 The inside story of the group, pieced together through dozens of interviews with militants and with intelligence, military and diplomatic officials, shows that the Algerians' decision to join Al Qaeda was driven by both practical forces and the global fault line of Sept. 11, 2001.
 Mr. Droukdal cited religious motivations for his group's merger with Al Qaeda. Some militants also said that Washington's designation of the Algerians as a terrorist organization after Sept. 11 -- despite its categorization by some American government experts as a regional insurgency -- had the effect of turning the group against the United States.
 ''If the U.S. administration sees that its war against the Muslims is legitimate, then what makes us believe that our war on its territories is not legitimate?'' Mr. Droukdal said in an audiotape in response to a list of questions from The New York Times, apparently his first contact with a journalist. 
 ''Everyone must know that we will not hesitate in targeting it whenever we can and wherever it is on this planet,'' he said.
 Interviews with American, European and Arab officials and a former lieutenant in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb indicate that more opportunistic factors were at play in the growth of the group. 
 A long-running government offensive against the Algerian insurgents had nearly crushed the group, officials said. They needed the Qaeda imprimatur to raise money and to shed their outlaw status in radical Muslim circles as a result of their slaughtering of civilians in the 1990s.
 The Iraq war also was drawing many of the group's best fighters, according to Mr. Khettab and a militant who trained Algerians in Iraq for Mr. Zarqawi. Embracing the global jihad was seen as a way to keep more of these men under the Algerian group's control and recruit new members.
 Then, in March 2004, a covert American military operation led to the capture of one of the group's top deputies. A few months later, Mr. Droukdal reached out to Mr. Zarqawi to get the man released. Mr. Zarqawi seized the opportunity to convince him that Al Qaeda could revive his operations, a former top leader of the Algerian group says.
 Just as the Qaeda leadership has been able to reconstitute itself in Pakistan's ungoverned tribal areas, Al Qaeda's North Africa offshoot is now running small training camps for militants from Morocco, Tunisia and as far away as Nigeria, according to the State Department and Mr. Droukdal. The State Department in April categorized the tribal areas and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb as the two top hot spots in its annual report on global terrorism.
 The threat is felt most acutely in Europe and in particular in France, which ruled Algeria for 132 years until 1962 and is a major trading partner with the authoritarian government in Algiers. 
 ''We're under a double threat now,'' Bernard Squarcini, chief of France's domestic and police intelligence service, said in an interview. ''A group that had limited its terrorist activities to Algeria is now part of the global jihad movement.'' 
 Last month, France signed military and nuclear development agreements with Algeria. Washington has also provided training to the Algerian military, and American companies have supplied equipment. 
 Even so, Western intelligence and diplomatic officials say the Algerian government has balked at making them full partners in investigating the group. Officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns.
 In Europe, the authorities are eyeing the Algerian group warily, but are not convinced that the group can strike outside Africa.
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said last week that the merger of Al Qaeda with the Algeria organization and others like it brought fresh risks. 
 ''These groups, as best we can tell, have a fair amount of independence. They get inspiration, they get sometimes guidance, probably some training, probably some money from the Al Qaeda leadership,'' he said, adding that ''it's not as centralized a movement as it was, say, in 2001. But in some ways, the fact that it has spread in the way that it has, in my view, makes it perhaps more dangerous.''

They included Abu Laith al-Libi, a Libyan militant killed this year by an American airstrike near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
 In September 2005, Mr. Droukdal declared France ''our No. 1 enemy, the enemy of our religion and of our community.'' A year later, the merger was formally announced by Mr. Zawahri, who said, ''Our brothers will be a bone in the throat of the American and French crusaders and their allies.'' 
 Expansion to Europe
 Last December, French officials arrested eight men from Paris suburbs and seized computers, electronic material, night-vision goggles, global positioning equipment, cellphones, weapons-making machinery and 20,000 euros, or about $30,000.
 Investigators said they believed that the men, both French-Algerians and Algerian passport holders, were sending logistical equipment to support an attack to Algeria. Whether or not the case leads to convictions -- six of the men have been released -- investigators say they viewed the arrests as the first concrete link they had found between France and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known by its initials as AQIM.
 The Spanish police said they made a similar discovery in June when they arrested eight Algerian-born men on suspicion of providing financial and logistical support to the Algerian group.
 European investigators are examining a group of Tunisians with alleged ties to the North African Qaeda operation who are suspected of running a fund-raising and recruitment cell stretching from Paris to Milan. So far, despite its stated intentions to strike Europe and the rest of the West, investigators say they see little evidence that the North Africa branch of Al Qaeda is exporting fighters and equipment for an attack in Europe.
 ''Their ambition is to attack in Europe, but I wouldn't hard-sell it,'' said Gilles de Kerchove, the head of counterterrorism for the European Union. ''I wouldn't say AQIM is poised to attack in Europe.''
 Although the Algerian government has been a ready trading partner with the West, it has been a reluctant ally in the West's effort against the Qaeda group. Algerian officials have declined to share key information on the United Nations bombing and have also refused to release the names of insurgents it freed from prison, according to American diplomatic and intelligence officials.
 The F.B.I. recently opened an office in Algiers in an attempt to foster improved information-sharing between Algeria and the United States, as well as France. ''We're trying to make this like an extended family,'' said Thomas Fuentes, the F.B.I.'s director of international operations.
 The tension between the Algerian government and its people continue. The government has reneged on public promises to spend more of its energy wealth on its unemployed youth who are prime recruits for Al Qaeda, according to American intelligence analysts. The Algerian government, which would not comment for this article, minimizes the threat. ''Terrorism has been vanquished, despite the sporadic manifestation we are facing up to in the most energetic manner,'' President Bouteflika told Reuters in March.
 But there is new evidence that Qaeda commanders see potential in its North African franchise. 
 Intelligence agents intercepted yet another message between headquarters and the Algeria branch this year. Mr. Zawahri sent Mr. Droukdal a private message, according to a top German intelligence official, noting that controversial Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad were set to be republished. He asked Mr. Droukdal to help in taking revenge.

HEADLINE: Deal Is Struck in Montana To Preserve Forest Areas

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
A huge patchwork of privately owned forest in northwest Montana -- much of it abutting wilderness, and together almost a third the size of Rhode Island -- will be permanently protected from development under an agreement announced Monday by two private conservation groups, the Nature Conservancy and the Trust for Public Land.
 The groups will pay $510 million for about 500 square miles of forest now owned by Plum Creek Timber, a lumber and real estate firm based in Seattle. It is one of the biggest sales of forest land for preservation purposes in United States history, conservation experts said. 
 About half the amount will come from private donations, the conservation buyers said, and about half from the federal government under a new tax-credit bond mechanism that was included in the giant farm bill recently passed by Congress over President Bush's veto. 
 The bond mechanism was devised by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. Mr. Baucus, his spokesman said, was approached about a year ago by representatives of the Nature Conservancy and the Trust for Public Land, who argued that development pressures were growing so intense that new tools had to be created to buy the Plum Creek properties if they were to be protected.
 ''The ordinary tool kit was not industrial-strength enough for us to make an offer,'' said William Ginn, the director of conservation markets and investments for the Nature Conservancy, and one of the lead negotiators of the deal.
 Mr. Baucus's spokesman, Barrett Kaiser, said that while Montana might be the pilot for the conservation bonds, Mr. Baucus believed there would be applications for preserving lands all over the country. Mr. Kaiser said there had been ''no deal on the table'' to buy the Plum Creek properties when the bond measure was passed.
 The lands in this case were considered especially valuable, and vulnerable to the effects of development, because most were in fragments -- 640-acre squares interspersed in a checkerboard with public lands mostly owned by the Forest Service. Checkerboard ownership is a legacy of the railroad-building of the late 1800s and early 1900s, when the government offered millions of acres of the West as an incentive to companies laying track through Montana and other Rocky Mountain states.
 The purchases, which are to be completed in phases over the next two years, with most of the land then conveyed to the Forest Service or other government agencies over the next decade, will essentially fill in the checkerboard, Mr. Ginn said. An outline of the project is on the Nature Conservancy's Web site, www.nature.org. 
 Grizzly bears and other animals that now face transit through public-private checkerboard lands in the Swan Valley, northeast of Missoula, will have a straight path, for example, between the Bob Marshall Wilderness and the Mission Mountains Wilderness.
 ''That has huge implications, positive ones, from a biodiversity standpoint,'' Mr. Ginn said.
 Creating a more continuous fabric of lands in public ownership also helps the Forest Service in its firefighting duties, since a filled-in checkerboard reduces access issues in reaching interior areas of the forest. 
 Mr. Ginn said that while long-term protection is the goal, the deal also includes provisions for some continued timber cutting on the lands, with logs sold at market rates to Plum Creek lumber mills in Montana over the next 15 years. He said that third-party-certified sustainable forestry standards would be used in choosing how much to cut and where, and that overall timber cutting would decline.
 Mr. Ginn also said that new thinking about how to maintain undeveloped lands in the West was increasingly dependent on maintaining their economical value, and that keeping forestry jobs in places like Montana would bolster overall forest values as another tool to keep them from being developed.

HEADLINE: Deep Down, We Can't Fool Even Ourselves

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
In voting against the Bush tax cut in 2001, Senator John McCain said he ''cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate.'' Today he campaigns in favor of extending that same tax cut beyond its expiration date. 
 Senator Barack Obama last year called himself a ''longtime advocate'' of public financing of election campaigns. This month, he reiterated his ''support'' for such financing while becoming the first major party presidential nominee ever to reject it for his own campaign.
 Do you think either of these men is a hypocrite? 
 If so, does this hypocrite really believe, in his heart, what he is saying?
 Fortunately, we don't need to get into the fine points of taxes or campaign finances to take a stab at these questions. We can probably get further by looking at some experiments in what psychologists call moral hypocrisy. 
 This is a more devious form of hypocrisy than what was exhibited by, say, the governor of New York when he got caught patronizing a prostitute. It was obviously hypocritical behavior for a public official who had formerly prosecuted prostitutes and increased penalties for their customers, but at least Eliot Spitzer acknowledged his actions were wrong by anyone's standards.
 The moral hypocrite, by contrast, has convinced himself that he is acting virtuously even when he does something he would condemn in others. You can understand this ''self-halo'' effect -- and perhaps discover it in someone very close to you -- by considering what happened when two psychologists, Piercarlo Valdesolo and David DeSteno, tested people's reactions to the following situation. 
 You show up for an experiment and are told that you and a person arriving later will each have to do a different task on a computer. One job involves a fairly easy hunt through photos that will take just 10 minutes. The other task is a more tedious exercise in mental geometry that takes 45 minutes. 
 You get to decide how to divvy up the chores: either let a computer assign the tasks randomly, or make the assignments yourself. Either way, the other person will not know you had anything to do with the assignments. 
 Now, what is the fair way to divvy up the chores?
 When the researchers posed this question in the abstract to people who were not involved in the tasks, everyone gave the same answer: It would be unfair to give yourself the easy job.
 But when the researchers actually put another group of people in this situation, more than three-quarters of them took the easy job. Then, under subsequent questioning, they gave themselves high marks for acting fairly. The researchers call this moral hypocrisy because the people were absolving themselves of violating a widely held standard of fairness (even though they themselves hadn't explicitly endorsed that standard beforehand).
 A double standard of morality also emerged when other people were arbitrarily divided in two groups and given differently colored wristbands. They watched as one person, either from their group or from the other group, went through the exercise and assigned himself the easy job. 
 Even though the observers had no personal stake in the outcome -- they knew they would not be stuck with the boring job -- they were still biased. On average, they judged it to be unfair for someone in the other group to give himself the easy job, but they considered it fair when someone in their own group did the same thing.
 ''Anyone who is on 'our team' is excused for moral transgressions,'' said Dr. DeSteno, a psychologist at Northeastern University. ''The importance of group cohesion, of any type, simply extends our moral radius for lenience. Basically, it's a form of one person's patriot is another's terrorist.''
 If a colored wristband is enough to skew your moral judgment, imagine how you are affected by the ''D'' or the ''R'' label on your voting registration. If you are a Democrat, you are more likely to think Mr. McCain hypocritically switched tax policies to pick up conservative votes, but Mr. Obama's decision to abandon public financing probably looks more complicated. If you're a Republican you're likelier to figure Mr. Obama did it just so he could raise more money on his own, but you're more willing to consider Mr. McCain's economic rationales.
 The more interesting question is how presidential candidates, and their supporters, turn into hypocrites. It has been demonstrated repeatedly in experiments that humans are remarkably sensitive to unfairness. We've survived as social animals because we are so good at spotting selfishness and punishing antisocial behavior.
 So how we do violate our own moral code? Does our gut instinct for self-preservation override our moral reasoning? Do we use our powers of rationality to override our moral instinct?
 ''The question here,'' Dr. DeSteno said, ''is whether we're designed at heart to be fair or selfish.'' 
 To find out, he and Dr. Valdesolo brought more people into the lab and watched them selfishly assign themselves the easy task. Then, at the start of the subsequent questioning, some of these people were asked to memorize a list of numbers and retain it in their heads as they answered questions about the experiment and their actions.
 That little bit of extra mental exertion was enough to eliminate hypocrisy. These people judged their own actions just as harshly as others did. Their brains were apparently too busy to rationalize their selfishness, so they fell back on their intuitive feelings about fairness. 
 ''Hypocrisy is driven by mental processes over which we have volitional control,'' said Dr. Valdesolo, a psychologist at Amherst College. ''Our gut seems to be equally sensitive to our own and others' transgressions, suggesting that we just need to find ways to better translate our moral feelings into moral actions.''
 That is easier said than done, especially in an election year. Even if the presidential candidates know in their guts that they are being hypocritical, they cannot very well be kept busy the whole campaign doing mental arithmetic. Besides, they are surrounded by advisers with plenty of spare mental power to rationalize whatever it takes to win. 
 Politicians are hypocritical for the same reason the rest of us are: to gain the social benefits of appearing virtuous without incurring the personal costs of virtuous behavior. If you can deceive even yourself into believing that you're acting for the common good, you'll have more energy and confidence to further your own interests -- and your self-halo can persuade others to help you along.
 But as useful as hypocrisy can be, it's apparently not quite as basic as the human instinct to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Your mind can justify double standards, it seems, but in your heart you know you're wrong.

HEADLINE: As Foreclosures Escalate

 BODY:
By the time the Senate returns next Monday from its July 4 recess, some 55,000 more homes will have entered foreclosure. And that's hardly the full picture of the growing calamity. More than three million homeowners are currently at risk of default and millions more are expected to join them in the coming year as home prices drop, the economy falters and delinquencies rise. Yet the Senate went ahead with its vacation last Friday without passing a foreclosure prevention measure.
 The bill was expected to pass, but the vote was derailed by petty politics. Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, for example, demanded that the Senate add a multibillion dollar package of tax breaks for renewable energy. Democrats balked -- not out of opposition to the tax breaks, which rightly enjoy bipartisan support, but because Mr. Ensign wanted to tack them on to the foreclosure bill without paying for them. That would threaten passage of the bill in the House, which is more committed than the Senate to pay-as-you-go governing. 
 This sort of delay achieves political ends, like denying Democrats the chance to campaign on the accomplishment during the recess, but it's exceedingly poor policy. Foreclosures are feeding the nation's severe economic problems. Turmoil in the financial markets is rooted in the collapse of the housing bubble and will not abate until house prices stabilize and sales pick up. Even Americans fortunate enough to have a down payment and a willing lender are hesitating, understandably fearful of further price drops. Rising foreclosures add daily to the glut of unsold homes, pushing prices down and foreclosures up in a vicious cycle.
 That same financial turmoil, coupled with huge losses in home equity, has deprived many Americans of the means or the confidence to buy a new house or other big-ticket items, like cars. In a recent Gallup poll, a majority of Americans said they were now worse off financially than they were a year ago. That's the first time in the 32-year history of the question that more than half the population has reported losing ground. 
 Unfortunately, the pessimism is justified. The Bush-era expansion was based largely on a boom in bad lending and house-price inflation -- not on robust employment, wage increases or sustainable gains in household wealth. As a result, many Americans have spent the last several years taking on debt, rather than building their earning power or adding to savings. They are ill prepared to cope with a weakening economy and rising gas prices, and they know it. 
 This spring's tax refunds and stimulus checks have been a boost, but it won't last. Soon, defaults on credit cards and auto loans are likely to pick up, and lenders will respond by keeping credit tight.
 The foreclosure prevention bill is not a cure-all, by any means, but is a way to try to break the cycle. It would allow many troubled borrowers to exchange their unaffordable loans for new mortgages guaranteed by the federal government -- as long as the lender agreed to reduce the existing loan balance to 85 percent of the home's current value. It is questionable whether lenders would be willing to take the loss, and there's nothing in the law to prod them to do so.
 Still, the bill's passage, which should be the Senate's priority next week, would be an overdue acknowledgment that the foreclosure mess requires government intervention. Lawmakers could build on the effort as needed, but it is unconscionable not to take the first step.

HEADLINE: Markets End Flat as Energy Shares Offset Financials

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were little changed on Monday on the final trading day of the second quarter as record oil prices lifted energy shares, offsetting weak financial stocks amid concerns of further credit losses.
 The Dow and S.& P. posted their worst one-month declines since September 2002. The Dow also suffered its worst first half since 1970. 
 The Nasdaq ended the session lower, hurt by a drop in the shares of Yahoo as it battles with shareholders after takeover talks with Microsoft fell apart.
 Shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron lent support to the Dow and the S.& P. 500. Oil rose to another record on rising Israeli-Iranian tensions, but then pulled back to trade slightly lower.
 Financial shares fell on more negative analyst comments. Richard Bove of Ladenburg Thalmann said Merrill Lynch would be forced to raise equity in the third quarter and might sell 20 percent of its holdings in Bloomberg for $1 billion. Mr. Bove also cut his 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley.
 Stocks started lower, rallied through midday but finished flat. Traders said the wide range was a result of positioning by portfolio managers making final adjustments at the end of the quarter.
 ''I'm sure with the continuing meltdown, there are a number of managers out there who don't want to be seen with certain financials on their books or even being as heavily weighted as they were,'' said Matt Kaufler, a portfolio manager and equity analyst at Clover Capital Management in Rochester, N.Y.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 3.50 points, or 0.03 percent, to end at 11,350.01. The S.& P. 500 was up 1.62 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,280.00. The Nasdaq composite index was down 22.65 points, or 0.98 percent, at 2,292.98.
 For the month, the Dow fell 10.2 percent, the S.& P. 500 fell 8.6 percent, and the Nasdaq ended down 9.1 percent.
 For the quarter, the Dow dropped 7.4 percent, the S.& P. 500 lost 3.2 percent, and the Nasdaq ended up 0.6 percent. The Dow ended 19.8 percent down from its October high.
 Shares of the American International Group and Citigroup ranked among the heaviest drags on the S.& P. 500.
 Shares of A.I.G. fell 5 percent to $26.46, and Citigroup declined 3 percent to $16.70. Lehman Brothers shares fell 11 percent to $19.81. Morgan Stanley's shares fell 1.7 percent to $36.07, and Merrill's shares shed 3 percent to $31.71.
 Yahoo's shares fell 3.1 percent to $20.66 as it sought to rally shareholder support for its board of directors and management, calling Carl C. Icahn's plan ''ill-defined'' for the future of the Internet company.
 Exxon Mobil rose 1.8 percent to $88.13, and Chevron climbed 1.4 percent to $99.13, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
 On the economic front, a report showed business activity in the Midwest contracted in June for a fifth straight month, but activity was not as weak as analysts had feared.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32, at 99- 7/32, and its yield remained at 3.97 percent. 
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: RAND Releases Delayed Iraq History

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The RAND Corporation issued a long-delayed report on Monday on problems in planning for postwar Iraq. 
 The 273-page study, which was prepared for the United States Army, chronicles a wide range of factors that hampered the American effort to stabilize Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein. 
 These included overly optimistic assumptions by policymakers and an assumption by senior military commanders that civilian authorities would have the main responsibility for the postwar period.
 Entitled ''After Saddam: Postwar Planning and the Occupation of Iraq,'' the study covers events through June 2004. It is available at http://www.rand.org/pubs/
 The study was drafted in 2005 but not published until Monday. A Pentagon official said earlier this year that one reason for the delay was the concern of some Army officials that the report would strain relations with Donald H. Rumsfeld, who was secretary of Defense in 2005. 
 The New York Times, which obtained a draft of the study in February, published an article about its conclusions that month. That prompted demands from lawmakers that the unclassified version of the study be publicly released. The RAND report was resubmitted to the Army. Army officials provided comments but did not seek to alter the report's analysis or conclusions, officials said. 
 Publication of the RAND report follows the release of a separate study by the Army Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth that chronicled postwar planning issues, ''On Point II: Transition to the New Campaign.''

HEADLINE: India Offers 8 Ideals on a Climate Change Policy, but Few Details

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
The Indian government pledged Monday to devote more attention to renewable energy, water conservation and preserving natural resources in the country's first climate change plan, but it did not set concrete goals or pledge to cap harmful emissions. 
 During a speech here on Monday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh acknowledged that climate change was a dangerous problem, but the plan he introduced reinforced India's long-held stance that developed nations created the bulk of the mess and should be responsible for cleaning it up. 
 ''There is a real possibility of catastrophic disruption of the fragile life-sustaining ecological system that holds this world together,'' Mr. Singh said. India traditionally ''treats nature as a source of nurture and not as a dark force to be conquered and harnessed to human endeavor,'' he said. ''There is a high value placed in our culture to the concept of living in harmony with nature.'' 
 India will pursue eight national ''missions'' for sustainable development, Mr. Singh said. They are: pursuing solar energy, urging energy efficiency, creating a sustainable habitat, conserving water, preserving the Himalayan ecosystem, creating a ''green'' India, creating sustainable agriculture and, finally, establishing what he called a ''strategic knowledge platform for climate change.'' 
 How much the Indian government will spend on these goals, who will run the efforts and how they will be evaluated was unclear. A spokesman reached in Mr. Singh's office said he could not answer questions about the plan. 
 India is the fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, the main gas linked to climate change, after the United States, China and Russia, according to the most recent World Bank data. On an individual basis, though, Indians emit far less carbon dioxide than people in those countries and in Europe. 
 India and China argue that this is how their contribution to climate change should be judged.
 According to the World Bank data, the average Indian generates about one-tenth the amount of carbon dioxide as someone in Japan or Europe, and one-twentieth that of an American. 
 Swift economic growth and huge populations in India and China mean these countries are contributing more to the growth of emissions than developed countries. But, on an individual basis, these nations still produce far fewer pollutants and gases than developed countries. 
 Scientists in the West and international bodies set up to address climate change say that meaningful change cannot happen without the robust participation of India and China, which needs to come well before per capita emissions reach those of developed countries. 
 In April, President Bush pledged that the United States would stop the growth of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, without giving any specifics about how that would happen. The promise was an about-face for the current administration, which has long resisted emission caps and refused to join the Kyoto Protocol on limiting such emissions. 
 The Indian government is scheduled to attend a meeting of the Group of 8 in July in Japan, and climate change is expected to be a main topic there. 
 On Monday, Mr. Singh particularly emphasized the solar mission, saying that in India's plan the ''sun occupies center stage, as it should, being literally the original source of all energy.'' 
 The plan will ''look beyond'' the government to try to expand solar power in India, he said, a sign that the country will welcome private companies as well. 
 The plan ''reiterates India's position that the country is looking for technology as a solution, and not any mandatory cuts'' in carbon dioxide emissions, said Anshu Bharadwaj, the director of the Center for Science, Technology and Policy in Bangalore. 
 There were no specific targets set for energy efficiency, solar power use or water conservation. China's first climate change plan, released last year, called for improved energy efficiency and expansion of renewable and nuclear energy sources. China set some goals in areas like energy efficiency, but it has already fallen short of them, some analysts contend.

HEADLINE: Obama Courting Evangelicals Once Loyal to Bush

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Politically speaking, Susan Speakman is a different kind of evangelical.
 Mrs. Speakman, 59, a pastor and educator at Bethany Presbyterian Church in Bridgeville, Pa., an activist evangelical church southwest of Pittsburgh, backs Senator Barack Obama in the presidential race. Along with her 23-year-old son, Stephen, she supports Mr. Obama because of his stands on the Iraq war and matters of social justice. The two of them plan to spread the word in their community and beyond.
 ''What caught my attention early on was his comment that we don't want red states and blue states, but we want to find reconciliation and rapprochement with folks,'' said Mrs. Speakman, who changed her party affiliation to Democratic from Republican this year to vote for Mr. Obama in the Pennsylvania primary. ''I really object to the other approach -- divide and conquer, isolate and demonize the opposition. I try to engage the other side and try to find ways we can bring the values of the kingdom of God into the experience of humanity.''
 Mrs. Speakman is one of thousands of evangelical Christians and so-called faith voters whom the Obama campaign is recruiting in a major effort to connect with a part of the electorate that accounts for an estimated quarter of the voting population and helped elect George W. Bush president twice. 
 Mr. Obama and his advisers are seeking support not only among relatively moderate evangelicals like Mrs. Speakman, who voted for Mr. Bush in 2000 but backed Senator John Kerry, a Democrat, in 2004 because of her opposition to the war. They are also trying to take advantage of signs that some conservative Christians are rethinking their politics, urged along by a new generation of leadership and intensified concern about issues including climate change, genocide, AIDS and poverty.
 Between now and November, the Obama forces are planning as many as 1,000 house parties and dozens of Christian rock concerts, gatherings of religious leaders, campus visits and telephone conference calls to bring together voters of all ages motivated by their faith to engage in politics. It is the most intensive effort yet by a Democratic candidate to reach out to self-identified evangelical or born-again Christians and to try to pry them away from their historical attachment to the Republican Party.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to deliver a speech about faith in Zanesville, Ohio, in a battleground section of a battleground state, one where Mr. Bush relied heavily on evangelical voters to provide his narrow margin of victory in 2004. Mr. Obama's speech will follow by two days a trip by his Republican opponent, Senator John McCain, to visit the evangelist Billy Graham and his son the Rev. Franklin Graham, part of an effort by Mr. McCain to shore up his standing with religious conservatives.
 Mr. Obama is building his appeal in part on calls to heal political rifts and address human suffering. He is also drawing on his own characteristics and story, including his embrace of Christianity as an adult, a facility with biblical language and imagery and comfort in talking about how his religious beliefs animate his approach to public life. 
 But the subject of religion has become entangled in the false rumor that he is a Muslim. And it has been complicated by the effects of his association with his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., whose brand of black liberation theology brought religion, race and patriotism into the campaign in ways not helpful to Mr. Obama. He also faces significant hurdles in appealing to religious voters because of his tolerance for abortion and same-sex marriage.
 It appears that Mr. Obama's religious outreach efforts will be met by an increasingly intense reaction from the religious right.
 James C. Dobson, one of the most prominent evangelical leaders on the right, accused Mr. Obama last week of employing a deviant reading of Scripture and a ''fruitcake interpretation of the Constitution'' to justify his theology and world view. 
 The lobbying arm of another leading conservative Christian organization, the Family Research Council, began running advertisements last week highlighting Mr. Obama's support for abortion rights and accusing him of hypocrisy for saying that he stands for family responsibility.
 Joshua DuBois, director of religious affairs for the Obama campaign, said that the campaign expected resistance from a large part of the evangelical community, but that millions of faith voters were persuadable.
 ''We're not going to convince everybody,'' said Mr. DuBois, 25, a former associate pastor of a Pentecostal Assemblies of God church in Massachusetts. ''The most committed pro-lifers probably won't vote for him. But others will be open to him because they see he's a man of integrity, a person of faith who listens to and understands people of all religious backgrounds.'' The Obama campaign does not need to convince everybody in order to have an effect on the voting outcome in key states, only a relatively narrow slice of the religiously motivated voters who supported Mr. Bush by substantial margins in 2000 and 2004. And polls indicate that evangelicals and other religious voters are already migrating away from their overwhelming support of the Republicans, some because of disillusionment about the war, others because of concern about global warming, still others because of uncertainty about the economy.
 Corwin E. Smidt, a political scientist who directs the Henry Institute at Calvin College, a Christian liberal arts institution in Grand Rapids, Mich., said a survey of Christian voters he completed found that mainline Protestants were moving in a more Democratic direction.
 ''One of the things our survey revealed is that the kinds of issues that Obama is stressing would resonate with that particular group,'' Mr. Smidt said. 
 He said that if Mr. Obama could chip into the 78 percent vote that Mr. Bush received from white evangelical Christians in 2004 it could affect the outcome of this year's election.
 Mr. Obama won one important vote from the evangelical community when he received the endorsement of the Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell, leader of a Methodist megachurch in Houston, who has long been close to Mr. Bush and who officiated at Jenna Bush's wedding in May in Crawford, Tex. Mr. Caldwell denounced Mr. Dobson for his critique of Mr. Obama's faith and has assembled a group of religious leaders to defend Mr. Obama. Mr. McCain, who was raised an Episcopalian but switched to the Baptist church of his wife, Cindy, has never had the same levels of support among this group as Mr. Bush enjoyed, not least because he once labeled the evangelical leaders Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson ''agents of intolerance,'' a characterization he has since backed away from.
 Mr. McCain does not talk much in public about religion, and Christian conservatives have been slow to embrace him. He turned some off by quickly denouncing two supporters, the Rev. John Hagee and the Rev. Rod Parsley, after controversial statements they made came to light.
 Mark DeMoss, a public relations executive who represents Franklin Graham and other church leaders and conservative religious organizations, said recently that Mr. Obama could conceivably win as much as 40 percent of the evangelical vote.
 ''He is going to do reasonably well,'' Mr. DeMoss said, ''and that is due to a combination of things. One of them is a lack of passion and enthusiasm for John McCain among a lot of these folks, and Obama seems to be doing the right kinds of things to reach out to them.''
 Mr. DeMoss cited the meeting two weeks ago in Chicago in which Mr. Obama met privately with 30 religious leaders from many traditions and political persuasions, including several, like Mr. Graham, who were never likely to support him.
 Mr. Obama won praise for his openness to those who disagreed with him, Mr. DeMoss said, but he stood firm in his support for abortion rights and cemented opposition from those for whom that is a bedrock issue.
 Mr. Obama is also reaching out to young evangelicals, the so-called Joshua generation, a group that would seem to be a fertile ground for recruitment. 
 Leaders of the movement of progressives on religion and values, including Mara Vanderslice, Eric Sapp and Burns Strider (who advised Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton), are also working alongside the Obama campaign to attract support from these younger religious voters.
 Gabe Lyons, founder of the Fermi Project, a nonprofit group that educates church and youth leaders about Christianity and society, said many young evangelicals from the left and right had been turned off to politics.
 ''Obama is doing a better job of talking about his religious views and values than John McCain is,'' Mr. Lyons, 33, said. ''The challenge is that the closer young evangelicals get to understanding his policies the more they will struggle with them and many will slowly back off because for them abortion is such a huge point.''
 In a brief video shown at the beginning of meetings with religious voters, Mr. Obama says he is ''blessed'' to help lead a conversation about the role of religious people in changing the world. He speaks of poverty and war, health care and unemployment, and says that addressing these problems ''will require not just a change in government policy but a change of heart and a change of attitude.''

HEADLINE: McCain Heads Today for Colombia, Where Adviser Has Long Had Ties

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER; Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At a time when the role of lobbyists and special interests are at issue in the presidential campaign, Senator John McCain leaves Tuesday on a trip to Colombia, where a senior adviser to him has long had business and political ties.
 Since 1998, the lobbying firm headed until recently by Charlie Black, one of Mr. McCain's closest confidants, has earned more than $1.8 million representing the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, the leading foreign producer of gas and oil in Colombia. The lobbying firm, BKSH & Associates, has also represented Colombian textile and apparel manufacturers and a former foreign minister and presidential candidate who is also a prominent businesswoman. 
 According to official filings, Mr. Black, who resigned as chairman of BKSH in March, lobbied Congress, the State Department and the White House on Occidental's behalf regarding ''general energy issues'' and ''general trade issues'' involving Colombia. His list of activities also included winning ''foreign assistance for Colombia'' and efforts to block an economic embargo against the country, which has a questionable human rights record.
 ''Though he did not have high visibility, we encountered his shadow often,'' said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, an advocacy group that monitors Latin American human rights and political issues from Washington.
 Mr. McCain is making the trip in part to highlight his support for a free-trade agreement with Colombia that the Bush administration wants to see approved by Congress by year's end. The senator, a strong free-trade advocate, has spoken in favor of the accord on the campaign trail.
 His presumed Democratic opponent, Senator Barack Obama, opposes the deal and frequently cites it in campaign speeches as an example of what he sees as the administration's wrongheaded trade policies. Mr. Obama has expressed environmental and human rights concerns, including what he describes as the Colombian government's repression of labor unions.
 Mr. Black has recently been at the center of campaign controversy over an interview, published in June by Fortune magazine, in which he said that another terrorist attack on the United States would benefit Mr. McCain's candidacy. The McCain campaign declined to make him available to discuss his lobbying activities on behalf of Colombia for BKSH.
 ''The campaign has no connection to that firm and therefore no connection to the questions you are asking,'' said Tucker Bounds, a campaign spokesman.
 Occidental's activities in Colombia have long been controversial, both within that country and among human-rights, indigenous-rights and environmental groups abroad. The groups have accused the company of complicity in the killing of peasants thought to be sympathetic to the left-wing guerrilla groups that operate in the area where Occidental has pipelines or drilling activities. They have also blamed Occidental for the polluting of rural areas and have accused it of intimidating Indian tribes seeking to prevent drilling on their ancestral lands.
 Occidental has long denied the accusations, maintaining that its practices are environmentally sound and describing its critics as unrepresentative.
 The most controversial episode dates from December 1998, when the Colombian Air Force dropped cluster bombs on Santo Domingo, a village near an Occidental pipeline, killing 18 people. Human rights groups and Colombian government officials say the bombing was a mistake that occurred because three employees of a Florida-based aerial security company employed by Occidental to monitor guerrilla movements had provided incorrect coordinates to the Colombian military pilots.
 The American employees of the security company dropped out of sight, and Colombian government efforts to have them handed over for questioning and perhaps trial were fruitless. Frustrated by what they consider the security company's stonewalling, human rights groups filed suit in California in 2003 and 2004 against Occidental, whose headquarters is in Los Angeles.
 Occidental has denied any responsibility for the bombing of Santo Domingo, saying when the first suit was filed that it ''has not and does not provide lethal aid to Colombia's armed forces.'' 
 Even as the Santo Domingo attack became a cause celebre among human rights groups in Washington, as well as some lawmakers there, Congress approved a special appropriation of nearly $100 million for the protection of oil pipelines in Colombia in 2003, when Mr. Black's firm was lobbying on Occidental's behalf.
 Atossa Soltani, executive director of Amazon Watch, a human rights group that works on behalf of Colombian Indian tribes opposed to oil drilling and pipelines on their lands, said Mr. Black was also ''very active'' while Congress was debating a $1.3 billion military assistance package to Colombia that became law in 2000. ''We'd be making the rounds in Congress,'' Ms. Soltani said, ''and Oxy would be there making the rounds, too.''
 Occidental has come under fire as well in connection with the 2003 killing of three Colombian labor leaders who were initially and erroneously said to be affiliated with one of the guerrilla groups that regularly attack Occidental's installations. Three Colombian soldiers, all of them members of a special unit that guards an Occidental pipeline, were charged with murder.

HEADLINE: Obama's Money Class

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Barack Obama sells the Democratic Party short. He talks about his fund-raising success as if his donors were part of a spontaneous movement of small-money enthusiasts who cohered around himself. In fact, Democrats have spent years building their donor network. Obama's fund-raising base is bigger than John Kerry's, Howard Dean's and Al Gore's, but it's not different.
 As in other recent campaigns, lawyers account for the biggest chunk of Democratic donations. They have donated about $18 million to Obama, compared with about $5 million to John McCain, according to data released on June 2 and available at OpenSecrets.org. 
 People who work at securities and investment companies have given Obama about $8 million, compared with $4.5 for McCain. People who work in communications and electronics have given Obama about $10 million, compared with $2 million for McCain. Professors and other people who work in education have given Obama roughly $7 million, compared with $700,000 for McCain. 
 Real estate professionals have given Obama $5 million, compared with $4 million for McCain. Medical professionals have given Obama $7 million, compared with $3 million for McCain. Commercial bankers have given Obama $1.6 million, compared with $1.2 million for McCain. Hedge fund and private equity managers have given Obama about $1.6 million, compared with $850,000 for McCain. 
 When you break it out by individual companies, you find that employees of Goldman Sachs gave more to Obama than workers of any other employer. The Goldman Sachs geniuses are followed by employees of the University of California, UBS, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, National Amusements, Lehman Brothers, Harvard and Google. At many of these workplaces, Obama has a three- or four-to-one fund-raising advantage over McCain.
 When he is swept up in rhetorical fervor, Obama occasionally says that his campaign is 90 percent funded by small donors. He has indeed had great success with small donors, but only about 45 percent of his money comes from donations of $200 or less. 
 The real core of his financial support is something else, the rising class of information age analysts. Once, the wealthy were solidly Republican. But the information age rewards education with money. There are many smart high achievers who grew up in liberal suburbs around San Francisco, L.A. and New York, went to left-leaning universities like Harvard and Berkeley and took their values with them when they became investment bankers, doctors and litigators.
 Political analysts now notice a gap between professionals and managers. Professionals, like lawyers and media types, tend to vote and give Democratic. Corporate managers tend to vote and give Republican. The former get their values from competitive universities and the media world; the latter get theirs from churches, management seminars and the country club.
 The trends are pretty clear: rising economic sectors tend to favor Democrats while declining economic sectors are more likely to favor Republicans. The Democratic Party (not just Obama) has huge fund-raising advantages among people who work in electronics, communications, law and the catchall category of finance, insurance and real estate. Republicans have the advantage in agribusiness, oil and gas and transportation. Which set of sectors do you think are going to grow most quickly in this century's service economy?
 Amazingly, Democrats have cultivated this donor base while trending populist on trade by forsaking much of the Clinton Third Way approach and by vowing to raise taxes on capital gains and the wealthy. If Obama's tax plans go through, those affluent donors could wind up giving over 50 percent of their income to the federal government. 
 They've managed to clear these policy hurdles partly by looking out for tort lawyers and other special groups. But mostly they have taken advantage of the rivalry between the two American elites. 
 Over the past several years, the highly educated coastal rich have been engaged in a little culture war with the inland corporate rich. This is a war over values, leadership styles and social networks.
 Socially liberal knowledge workers naturally want to see people like themselves at the head of society, not people who used to run Halliburton and who are supported by a vast army of evangelicals.
 If the Democrats are elected, this highly educated class will have much more say over policy than during the campaign. Undecided voters sway campaigns, but in government, elites generally run things. Once the Republicans are vanquished, I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for that capital gains tax hike or serious measures to expand unionization. 
 Over the past few years, people from Goldman Sachs have assumed control over large parts of the federal government. Over the next few they might just take over the whole darn thing.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Plans to Close a Minivan Plant and Reduce Output of a Truck

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Chrysler said on Monday that it would close one of its two minivan plants and reduce output of a long-awaited new pickup truck in response to a steep slump in demand for large vehicles.
 Both plants affected by the announcement are in Fenton, Mo., 20 miles southwest of St. Louis. About 2,400 of the company's 3,500 hourly jobs in Fenton will be eliminated within four months, Chrysler said.
 Thomas W. LaSorda, one of Chrysler's two presidents and vice chairmen, said in a conference call that the minivan plant, which opened in 1959 and was closed for several years in the early 1990s, would be idled ''indefinitely,'' meaning there was no expectation that it would reopen. 
 ''We see no need for the capacity in the future,'' Mr. LaSorda said.
 At the same time, Chrysler is operating some plants on overtime to build more of the fuel-efficient small cars whose popularity has soared after rising gasoline prices. It is shortening summer shutdowns at some car plants to one week from two, and extending the annual shutdowns at some truck plants to keep inventories from building further.
 ''It's important that we act now to align ourselves with the current market reality,'' Mr. LaSorda said.
 But Mr. LaSorda insisted that Chrysler's owner, the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, was not considering more drastic actions like breaking up the automaker. He called growing speculation about that possibility ''absolute hogwash.''
 The quarter has been dismal for the industry. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company also recently announced production cuts and plant closures.
 Sales reports that the automakers will release Tuesday are expected to show that June was the worst month in as many as 15 years, with sales down about 17 percent from a year ago, according to estimates by Edmunds.com.
 Chrysler, which makes a higher proportion of trucks than other major automakers, is thought to have fared the worst, but all three Detroit companies are projected to report drops of at least 25 percent. Through May, Chrysler's sales were down 20 percent.
 ''The very difficult environment for auto sales continues to take a much heavier toll on the Big Three, which are being hit disproportionately by the consumer's dramatic shift away from traditional trucks toward more fuel-efficient vehicles,'' Brian Johnson, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, wrote in a note to clients.
 The Detroit car companies have significantly increased discounts on pickups and some other models, but with limited success. Ford recently said it would delay introducing its full-size pickup, the F-series, for two months while dealers try to sell their stocks of the current version.
 Chrysler said Monday that it would begin selling the 2009 Dodge Ram pickup on schedule in September, but that it would be assembled by only one shift of workers at the St. Louis North plant, rather than two. (Plants in Warren, Mich., and Saltillo, Mexico, also build the Ram.)
 By Oct. 31, Chrysler plans to shut down the adjacent St. Louis South plant. Chrysler will continue building the Chrysler Town and Country and Dodge Caravan in Windsor, Ontario; that plant is operating on three shifts.
 ''We continue to remain committed to and bullish about the Dodge Ram and the minivans,'' Mr. LaSorda said. ''But we have to better align the volume to our inventory.''
 Last fall, U.A.W. members who work at the Fenton plants overwhelmingly voted against a four-year labor contract with Chrysler, arguing that it contained no job security provisions or guarantees that their plants would remain open. The Fenton workers were among the first to vote on the deal at Chrysler and began a wave of dissent that threatened ratification of the contract, though it ultimately received narrow approval.
 The cuts affect about 9 percent of the jobs in Fenton, said the city's mayor, Dennis Hancock, who called the news disappointing but ''understandable, given the extreme slowdown in the economy.''
 Still, Mr. Hancock says he wishes that Chrysler had not selected both plants in Fenton as it grapples with the changing market. ''There's going to be a ripple effect,'' he said. ''No doubt about it.''

HEADLINE: THEATER: On London Stages, the Devil in Love's Deep Blue Sea

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
LONDON -- When lovers meet on London's stages this summer, the odds are it's not violins they're hearing. It's alarm bells.
Consider the strange, sad case of the Norwegian minister and the freethinking new woman, natural soul mates who find each other, only to destroy each other. Or the kindhearted Chinese prostitute whose affair with a pilot drives him to heroin addiction. Or the middle-class man and woman who consign themselves to lives of loneliness with the wrong people because that is what good people do. And that's not to mention the passion-addled barrister's wife, who, having left her husband for a younger man, is first seen trying to gas herself to death.
These typically tabloidish tales, which I've seen enacted quite compellingly during the past 10 days, were written by Ibsen, Brecht, Noel Coward and Terence Rattigan. And the new work I've sampled -- including Anthony Weigh's ''2,000 Feet Away,'' a symbol-heavy play at the Bush Theater about pedophilia in the American heartlands, starring Joseph Fiennes -- suggests that the contemporary outlook for romance is, if anything, less rosy. If one pattern has emerged from my theatergoing here, it's that the course of true love runs straight off a cliff. 
I suppose it could be argued that this view of the mating game reflects the jadedness of a culture whose favorite pulp reading (as in the United States) concerns the fast public couplings and uncouplings of the rich, famous and (preferably) beautiful. But the fact is that since Oedipus met Mom, bad love has been the stuff of good drama, providing friction, frissons, character excavation and opportunities for scenery chewing that rarely occur in the realm of happily ever after.
And in the hands of a master dramatist like Ibsen, whose ''Rosmersholm'' has been given a gripping revival at the Almeida Theater, a doomed affair becomes a prism that refracts the flaws and conflicts of a dysfunctional society. It seems safe to say that is the sort of society in which most Britons would say they are living these days.
Written in the 1880s, ''Rosmersholm'' was a pivotal work for Ibsen, looking back to his earlier studies of warping conformity (like ''An Enemy of the People'') and ahead to his psychologically complex portraits of dissatisfied and manipulative women (''Hedda Gabler''). It balances the virtues of both aspects of his career as it charts the collapse of ideals of Johannes Rosmer (Paul Hilton), a sheltered minister from an old family, and Rebecca West (Helen McCrory), a restless, charismatic woman who joined his household as a caretaker for his ailing (and now dead) wife.
The strength of Anthony Page's understated but intense production, which appears to take place in a cool, pervasive light that draws revelation from shadows, is its steady evocation of the corrosive chemistry not only between Rosmer and Rebecca but also between them and the milieu they inhabit. Mr. Hilton and Ms. McCrory are quietly magnificent, transforming melodramatic plot turns into natural steps in two people's unwitting and dangerous self-discovery.
There's no equivalent emotional nuance in Richard Jones's lively production of Brecht's ''Good Soul of Szechuan,'' which recently ended its run at the Young Vic Theater. Brecht's parable about a kindly streetwalker who discovers that following your heart isn't possible in a society driven by money, was largely performed in a broad, comic-strip style that worked best in the show's moments of song. (It's not easy making Brechtian disaffection affecting.)
In the title role of the (literally) divided heroine forced to assume a double identity, Jane Horrocks (of the films ''Life Is Sweet'' and ''Little Voice'') exuded the arch, heightened sweetness of a Gilbert and Sullivan ingenue. But there was a sad, genuine warmth when her character was surprised -- via an ambitious airline pilot (John Marquez) -- by love, a rhapsodic state pathetically at odds with the festering greed and corruption of working-class Sichuan.
What is it about women and pilots? In Rattigan's ''Deep Blue Sea,'' staged by Edward Hall at the Vaudeville Theater, a proper preacher's daughter leaves her husband for a hunky, unemployed test pilot to pursue the ecstasies and (mostly) agonies of physical passion. Mr. Hall is not a subtle director, and without one, this product of 1950s repression can sound as if it were made to be parodied. (''He said we were death to each other.'')
There is nothing dated, though, about Greta Scacchi's performance in a role originated onstage by Peggy Ashcroft and on film by Vivien Leigh. Ms. Ashcroft has said she hated being in the play because it made her feel as if she were walking around naked onstage. That is what the part requires, and that is what Ms. Scacchi, whose face maps the ravages of love as a cancer, delivers here and more.
Because Rattigan was gay in an age when homosexuality was illegal, ''The Deep Blue Sea'' has been read as a coded portrait of a love that dare not speak its name. So has Coward's screenplay for the four-handkerchief film ''Brief Encounter'' (1945), directed by David Lean. But the Kneehigh Theater's enchanting stage version looks beneath the movie's surface, not for evidence of thwarted same-sex passion, but for a sense of how the film was a product of its time and why its appeal endures.
Emma Rice, the show's director and writer, has staged it in a movie theater at the Cinema Haymarket, and presents it with the accouterments of a night at the pictures in the 1930s, right down to flashlight-wielding uniformed ushers. She also uses a louvered screen on which film is projected and through which the live performers regularly step. Like the current West End (and Broadway) hit ''Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps,'' this ''Encounter'' features a small cast conjuring assorted scenes and characters with do-it-yourself ingenuity.
Love -- as it's experienced by a doctor and a housewife, each comfortably married, who meet at a train station when she catches a cinder in her eye -- is regularly annotated via Coward songs both romantic and silly, film footage of crashing waves and a fantasy sequence that has the lovers swinging from chandeliers.
It all seems too precious at first. But with the excellent Naomi Frederick and Tristan Sturrock playing it straight in the leading roles, the show acquires a haunted poignancy that can't be laughed off. You realize that in exploring a genre of movie that caters to disappointed lives by mythologizing them as nobly self-sacrificing, Ms. Rice has pulled off the difficult trick of deconstructing something without destroying its heart.
The songs that interrupt the action, whether insinuatingly burlesque or urbanely forlorn, all trace a pattern of love as a disruptive if unavoidable force that informed most of Coward's work. As his ''I Am No Good at Love'' puts it:
For I feel the misery of the end
In the moment that it begins,
And the bitterness of the last goodbye
Is the bitterness that wins.
That song might well be the anthem for the London theater's summer of love.

HEADLINE: Union Fears the Loss of High Pay and Solid Benefits, Once Virtual Givens at Con Ed

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Sushil Cheema, Ann Farmer and Jason Grant contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Last year, Con Edison officials said, the company sifted through 68,000 job applications to hire 1,314 new workers. So far in 2008, the utility has picked up 528 new people from a pool of 26,000. The deluge of applicants for what has long been seen as a blue-collar ticket to a middle-class life led Louis L. Rana, president of Consolidated Edison of New York Inc., to remark over the weekend that his company was harder to get into than Harvard.
Now, the solid wages and benefits that for decades have led Irish- and Italian-American men to follow their fathers and grandfathers into manholes, bucket trucks and substations are under threat, as the utility and the union that represents 8,800 of its nearly 14,000 workers try to hammer out a new four-year contract. The most recent pact expired on Sunday morning, with the union angry over what it described as the company's proposal for a 1.5 percent annual wage increase -- short of the 4.2 percent inflation rate -- and a 401(k)-style savings plan, rather than the traditional pension, for new workers. The union, Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, represents almost two-thirds of Con Edison's employees. 
''When I started, Con Ed was a very good company with great benefits, job security,'' said Ken Burns, 46, a splicer who works in the Bronx and has 22 years with the company, where his grandfather spent his working life. ''But with each contract, our benefits have decreased.''
Like other Con Edison workers interviewed on Monday, Mr. Burns said he liked his job and was treated well. But with gas prices rising, he said he had been spending $120 a week lately to get to work from his home in Stroudsburg, Pa., where he moved because he said it was the closest place he could find something affordable. And he noted that splicers risk serious injury handling high-voltage lines and must work in extreme heat and cold.
The slowing economy and the increase in prices of everyday goods make the prospect of going on strike unappealing to many workers. At the same time, the union has some leverage, because fast-growing parts of the country have a shortage of utility workers and are offering higher wages with lower costs of living.
Talks are scheduled to reconvene Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Wages at Con Edison appear to be healthy for workers without college diplomas, with a general utility worker, the equivalent of an Army private, earning $15.20 an hour to start and topping out at $25.35, which translates into about $52,000 a year for a full-time worker. Meter readers can earn as much as $31.92, mechanics up to $36.33, though it may take them nearly 20 years to reach that level. Splicers like Mr. Burns can earn more than $38 an hour.
As the power industry was deregulated over the past decade, Con Edison, like other utilities, has been under pressure from shareholders and customers to keep labor costs down, eroding some of the benefits that drew workers to the utility.
''I know the company needs to pay for increased prices of fuel, et cetera, but I feel the company is trying to take advantage of the situation,'' said Winston Krieger, 49, who lives in Hicksville, N.Y., and has been a welding mechanic at the utility for 20 years. ''They're going backwards. If they give us this this time, what will they do next time?''
Paul Albano, a mechanic in transformer operations for 21 years, said that he started putting money aside as a precaution about a month ago, when the possibility of a strike began to seem real. ''It's hard on me, as well as everyone else,'' said Mr. Albano, 45, who supports an ill wife on his wages and has six children. ''There are a lot of young people working here with children and older folks with health issues.''
Con Edison executives declined to discuss the tenor or details of the contract negotiations.
With electricity demand in New York City having grown 20 percent in the last decade and baby boomers retiring, Con Edison has been hiring aggressively, and more than a third of the utility's current work force has less than five years' experience. That has created a rift between older workers who are trying to protect what they have fought for and younger workers not wanting to jeopardize their standing in the company.
While Irish and Italian men long dominated both the rank and file and the union leadership, more than half of the people hired in the past two years have been minorities, company officials said, and one in five were women.
Union officials contend the company is trying to drive a wedge between the generations with the two-tiered pension plan.
''The men are nervous,'' said Joseph Tusa, 57, who has worked for 38 years at Con Edison as an underground transmission mechanic, as he left the utility's substation in Astoria, Queens, on Monday. ''They don't have confidence in the future. They are worried about who is going to get the money in the future. It's a trap for down the road.''
Ed Ott, the executive director of New York City Central Labor Council, said of the union workers: ''They've obtained a certain level of benefits, health care and raises that anyone would be glad to have, and they're fighting to keep what they gained.''
Local 1-2 began representing Con Edison's workers in 1937, the year after the Public Service Commission approved a merger of several utility companies.
According to one history, those smaller, individual utilities had what were known as company unions, which management had helped set up. Once Con Edison was formed, the workers moved quickly to leave those organizations and join the feisty Utility Workers Union.
Through a series of contract battles during the late 1930s and '40s, the union, part of the often-militant Congress of Industrial Organizations, obtained a coveted compensation package for Con Edison workers.
''It was a union where you get out of high school, you get a job and because of that union, you get a good life,'' said Joshua B. Freeman, a historian at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and author of ''Working-Class New York.''
Joseph Cobert went to work at Con Edison in 1948, after serving on the Intrepid during World War II, and spent 58 years as a utility mechanic, returning home every day covered with coal dust.
''The union was really taking care of us at the time,'' said Mr. Cobert, now 86. ''Prices were going up, and the union always thought you had to do better than in the previous contract. When the union got going and started pushing hard on things, the threat of a strike was always there.''

HEADLINE: Promise of Biofuel Clouded by Weather Risks

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The record storms and floods that swept through the Midwest last month struck at the heart of America's corn region, drowning fields and dashing hopes of a bumper crop.
They also brought into sharp relief a new economic hazard. As America grows more reliant on corn for its fuel supply, it is becoming vulnerable to the many hazards that can damage crops, ranging from droughts to plagues to storms.
The floods have helped send the price of ethanol up 19 percent in a month. They appear to have had little effect on the price of gasoline at the pump, as ethanol represents only about 6 percent of the nation's transport fuel today.
But that share is expected to rise to at least 20 percent in coming decades. Experts fear that a future crop failure could take so much fuel out of the market that it would send prices soaring at the pump. Eventually, the cost of filling Americans' gas tanks could be influenced as much by hail in Iowa as by the bombing of an oil pipeline in Nigeria. 
''We are holding ourselves hostage to the weather,'' said John M. Reilly, a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an ethanol expert. ''Agricultural markets are subject to wide variability and big price spikes, just like oil markets.''
Three years ago, Americans discovered that the vicissitudes of the weather could have a powerful effect on energy prices when two hurricanes struck the Gulf Coast. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita interrupted a quarter of the nation's oil production and closed dozens of refineries for weeks. Lines formed for the first time since the 1970s as gasoline spiked above $3 a gallon, a record at the time. The nation's increasing dependence on crops for motor fuel adds another level of vulnerability from the weather.
It is still too early to estimate damage to corn crops from the recent floods, or their impact on ethanol output. Iowa, the biggest corn state, may have lost as much as 10 percent of its harvest, according to preliminary estimates.
But concerns that the floods could tighten corn supplies this year have pushed up both corn and ethanol prices. Ethanol, which was already rising before the floods, has nearly doubled from its low of $1.50 a gallon in September.
Unexpected interruptions in oil supplies have been a factor driving oil prices above $140 a barrel lately. Given the tight oil market, there is little untapped capacity that can be brought online to make up for sudden supply interruptions, whether of oil itself or of the biofuels that are increasingly substituting for oil.
In the 1980s, the oil capacity cushion peaked at around 20 percent of global consumption. Today, it represents only about 2 percent -- less than Iran's petroleum exports. Analysts have warned that such record-low levels of spare capacity pose unprecedented risks to the stability of oil markets and introduce a significant premium in the price of oil.
''There is now a vulnerability to perfect storms, not just in a metaphorical sense, but increasingly in a literal sense,'' said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm. ''In addition to geopolitical risks, you must now add weather risks.''
While storms, torrential rains and hurricanes have always been a part of energy production, the areas where most of the nation's new oil and ethanol supplies are coming from -- the corn belt and the Gulf of Mexico -- are especially vulnerable to hazardous weather.
''Our energy policy is like playing Russian roulette with every chamber loaded,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an energy analyst at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, a group backed by the oil industry. ''We've doubled up on the weather risk.''
Both the government and the ethanol industry recognize the risks of tying fuels to crops. The secretaries of energy and agriculture, in a joint letter to the Senate, recently said: ''If we assumed a supply disruption of ethanol, we would expect a fairly large increase in the price of gasoline until ethanol supply were re-established or new market equilibriums were achieved.''
Backers of biofuels contend that growing ethanol supply is keeping gasoline prices from rising even higher than they have, by anywhere from 35 cents to 50 cents a gallon, in their estimation. They also point out that the government's ethanol mandate, which requires oil companies to blend ethanol into motor fuel, can be suspended in an emergency. Finally, they say that future ethanol supplies will be derived from materials like switchgrass or wood chips that are resistant to bad weather.
Bob Dinneen, the president of the Renewable Fuels Association, the industry's main trade group, said only two out of 160 ethanol refineries nationwide shut down because of the storms. Both will reopen soon, he said.
''There is a lot of overblown concern that is not really justified by the facts on the ground,'' Mr. Dinneen said. ''Certainly the weather is going to have an impact on all sorts of industries. It had an impact when Katrina wreaked havoc on the refining industry. It has an impact on ethanol production, but it has been minimal.''
In recent years, corn ethanol has been one of the few sources of supply growth in transport fuels. Indeed, biofuels have become the single biggest source of new fuels produced outside of countries belonging to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Production worldwide is expected to grow by 330,000 barrels a day this year, to 1.4 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency.
In the United States, bipartisan public policies have driven the rise of the ethanol industry. Congress has set rising requirements for oil companies to blend ethanol with gasoline, backed with generous subsidies that should total $12 billion this year, according to estimates by Barclays Capital.
The ethanol mandate is set at nine billion gallons for 2008 and is scheduled to rise to 36 billion gallons a year by 2022. By various estimates, that would represent 20 to 25 percent of the nation's gasoline consumption by then.
Corn ethanol is capped at 15 billion gallons from 2015 onward. The rest is supposed to come from advanced biofuels. They would not require food crops, but bringing them to market depends on perfecting techniques that are still experimental.
Farmers who support the government's ethanol policy argue that truly disastrous weather in the corn belt does not happen often.
''The last time we had real weather problems in the corn belt was 1988,'' said Tom Buis, the president of the National Farmers Union. ''That's pretty rare.''
Emerson D. Nafziger, a professor of agronomy at the University of Illinois, said farmers still had time to recover this year, to some degree. But he said this year's storms were the first real test for the nascent ethanol industry.
''We may end up feeling we dodged a bullet this year,'' he said. ''We've had a run of fairly favorable weather in recent years. But there is no guarantee it will stay that way.''

HEADLINE: Rebuilding At 9/11 Site Runs Late, Report Says

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At the World Trade Center site, the memorial to the people who died on Sept. 11, 2001, will not be open to the public in time for the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, as had been previously announced.
The $2.5 billion PATH station and transit hub nearby are not only behind schedule and over budget, but the final design is not even finished.
On the south side of the site, the demolition of the Deutsche Bank tower will not be completed until sometime next year, at least 14 months behind schedule.
For at least a year, some officials involved in the rebuilding effort have hinted that delays for any one of the 26 separate but interrelated projects on the 16 acres were compounding. But on Monday, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, issued a 34-page report listing the site's problems, saying, ''The schedule and cost for each of the public projects on the site face significant delays and cost overruns.'' 
The Port Authority adamantly refused to offer new schedules or cost estimates, but some officials said the delays could run up to three years. The cost overruns could extend into the billions for a project whose total cost is now more than $15 billion.
At the heart of the problem, the report said, were overly ambitious completion dates that were probably inaccurate from the day they were announced. Those dates were set at a time when former Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the Port Authority wanted to convey the sense that this most politically, economically and emotionally significant of projects would be completed quickly.
The report also illuminated in great detail just why that schedule was so inaccurate: The work entails more than two dozen projects, some of them large and extremely complex, all within the confines of a dozen square blocks. Nineteen public agencies, two private developers and 101 construction contractors and subcontractors are involved.
Although Port Authority officials publicly acknowledged the daunting problems on Monday, they were also eager to convey the sense that some progress was being made on the centerpiece, the 1,776-foot-tall Freedom Tower, as well as on three other office towers, the transit hub and the foundations for the memorial.
''The World Trade Center site is being rebuilt, will continue to be rebuilt, and it will be completed,'' Christopher O. Ward, executive director of the Port Authority, said on Monday. ''The question surrounding the World Trade Center rebuilding is not if all of the projects will be built, rather when and for how much.''
At the same time, Mr. Ward conceded that ''there will clearly be some triage,'' meaning some projects at ground zero may have to be delayed while others are accelerated. The PATH station designed by Santiago Calatrava will have to be revised, he said. Public officials will also have to decide how to keep the station for the No. 1 subway line at the site from impeding construction that is only inches away.
At a news conference on Monday, Gov. David A. Paterson, who had asked the Port Authority for the report on the overall rebuilding effort, painted a grim picture. He said past estimates and schedules had been so unrealistic, and so much essential information remained unknown, that even now, the authority would not set a completion date.
Instead, Mr. Paterson said, he had ordered that all stakeholders in the effort meet to find a way to centralize decision-making about the site. The goal, he said, was to come up with a more realistic schedule and budgets by Sept. 30.
''Here's what we're not going to do,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''We're not going to give any phony dates or timetables at this point and then follow it up with phony ribbon-cuttings and encouraging words and no follow-up.''
Mr. Paterson also said there would be no casting of blame for the rebuilding delays.
''I don't know that it would be important to assess that it was the fault of people or that they were irresponsible,'' he said. ''I think, all in all, everyone was trying to do the right thing.''
Still, the reference to phony ribbon-cuttings and the like amounted to a rebuke of Mr. Pataki, who was in office in 2001 and viewed the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan as a central element of his 12-year legacy.
''For years, unrealistic deadlines were set,'' said Julie Menin, chairwoman of Community Board 1, whose district includes the site. ''There seemed to be more interest in having press conferences declaring how Lower Manhattan would be rebuilt better than ever, than in establishing realistic deadlines and budgets. Now we're in a situation where projects could be stalled, or are years away from being completed.''
Ms. Menin said tension between the Pataki and Bloomberg administrations also contributed to the delays. ''There were times when literally the city and state each separately would call me to say they did not want to sit at the same table when presenting at a community board meeting,'' she said.
David Catalfamo, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, dismissed the criticism, saying: ''From Day 1, Governor Pataki insisted on an aggressive schedule for ground zero. It was important to put a schedule out there to keep the process moving. We encourage them to continue to be aggressive.''
In comments to reporters on Monday, Mayor Bloomberg seemed to downplay the overall significance of the delays. ''It is very difficult to forecast in such a complex development project any kind of realistic date and cost,'' he said. ''We want to have a design for the World Trade Center site that we will look back on 50 years from now and say that they did it right.''
The prospect of delays and overruns has long been evident, despite assurances by the Port Authority as recently as this April that the project would proceed on schedule. In April 2007, the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center, which was established by Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg, issued a thick internal assessment suggesting that an underground center for screening vehicles entering the site, the PATH station and the memorial museum could be more than four years behind schedule and over budget.
Eliot Spitzer, then the governor, and Anthony E. Shorris, then the executive director of the Port Authority, rebuffed a recommendation by Avi Schick, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, to make that assessment public. Mr. Shorris and Mr. Spitzer feared that they would lose leverage with contractors and make any delays inevitable if they revised the schedules and budgets for the project.
Monday's announcement did not make it any easier for the developer, Larry Silverstein, to market the three office towers, with a total of 6.2 million square feet of space, that he is building on the site. In a statement he released after the Port Authority board meeting on Monday, Mr. Silverstein said: ''As of today, my company's projects are fully designed and on schedule. Construction of Towers 3 and 4 is under way, and all three buildings are slated for completion, as projected, by the end of 2012.''
There is little doubt that rebuilding the World Trade Center is an enormously complex task. There are plans for five major skyscrapers with roughly as much office space as downtown Atlanta; the third-largest transportation hub in New York City; two new city streets; a major performing arts center; and more than 500,000 square feet of shops.
The Port Authority report does not say how long some projects could be delayed or revise its estimates for how much the rebuilding will cost. It expects to answer those questions by September, when it plans to issue the second part of its report. Final designs must also be completed then for the PATH station and the memorial.
Many parts of the project are interconnected. Construction of the vehicle-screening center cannot be finished until the long-delayed demolition of the former Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty Street is completed. Holdups in negotiations with a nearby Greek Orthodox church, which was destroyed in the terrorist attack, have also slowed progress on the screening center. An office tower for JPMorgan Chase is planned for the Deutsche Bank site, while a portion of the screening center will sit below the rebuilt church.
''The World Trade Center site is so complex because of the infrastructure that runs underneath it and the requirements for rebuilding that no one should be surprised that the commercial development and the memorial will take longer than originally anticipated,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University. ''There was an overemphasis on speed which is being superseded by a more realistic timetable.''

HEADLINE: A Ragtag Insurgency Gains a Qaeda Lifeline

BYLINE: By SOUAD MEKHENNET, MICHAEL MOSS, ERIC SCHMITT, ELAINE SCIOLINO and MARGOT WILLIAMS. 
Souad Mekhennet and Michael Moss reported from Algeria, Morocco and Germany; Eric Schmitt from Washington; Elaine Sciolino from Paris; and Margot Williams from New York. Sophie Cois contributed reporting from Paris, and Basil Katz from Lyon, France.

DATELINE: NACIRIA, Algeria 

 BODY:
Hiding in the caves and woodlands surrounding this hill-country town, Algerian insurgents were all but washed up a few years ago.
Their nationalist battle against the Algerian military was faltering. ''We didn't have enough weapons,'' recalled a former militant lieutenant, Mourad Khettab, 34. ''The people didn't want to join. And money, we didn't have enough money.''
Then the leader of the group, a university mathematics graduate named Abdelmalek Droukdal, sent a secret message to Iraq in the fall of 2004. The recipient was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and the two men on opposite ends of the Arab world engaged in what one firsthand observer describes as a corporate merger.
Today, as Islamist violence wanes in some parts of the world, the Algerian militants -- renamed Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- have grown into one of the most potent Osama bin Laden affiliates, reinvigorated with fresh recruits and a zeal for Western targets. 
Their gunfights with Algerian forces have evolved into suicide truck bombings of iconic sites like the United Nations offices in Algiers. They have kidnapped and killed European tourists as their reach expands throughout northern Africa.
Last month, they capped a string of attacks with an operation that evoked the horrors of Iraq: a pair of bombs outside a train station east of Algiers, the second one timed to hit emergency responders. A French engineer and his driver were killed by the first bomb; the second one failed to explode.
The transformation of the group from a nationalist insurgency to a force in the global jihad is a page out of Mr. bin Laden's playbook: expanding his reach by bringing local militants under the Qaeda brand. The Algerian group offers Al Qaeda hundreds of experienced fighters and a potential connection to militants living in Europe. Over the past 20 months, suspects of North African origin have been arrested in Spain, France, Switzerland and Italy, although their connection to the Algerians is not always clear.
The inside story of the group, pieced together through dozens of interviews with militants and with intelligence, military and diplomatic officials, shows that the Algerians' decision to join Al Qaeda was driven by both practical forces and the global fault line of Sept. 11, 2001.
Mr. Droukdal cited religious motivations for his group's merger with Al Qaeda. Some militants also said that Washington's designation of the Algerians as a terrorist organization after Sept. 11 -- despite its categorization by some American government experts as a regional insurgency -- had the effect of turning the group against the United States.
''If the U.S. administration sees that its war against the Muslims is legitimate, then what makes us believe that our war on its territories is not legitimate?'' Mr. Droukdal said in an audiotape in response to a list of questions from The New York Times, apparently his first contact with a journalist.
''Everyone must know that we will not hesitate in targeting it whenever we can and wherever it is on this planet,'' he said.
Interviews with American, European and Arab officials and a former lieutenant in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb indicate that more opportunistic factors were at play in the growth of the group.
A long-running government offensive against the Algerian insurgents had nearly crushed the group, officials said. They needed the Qaeda imprimatur to raise money and to shed their outlaw status in radical Muslim circles as a result of their slaughtering of civilians in the 1990s.
The Iraq war also was drawing many of the group's best fighters, according to Mr. Khettab and a militant who trained Algerians in Iraq for Mr. Zarqawi. Embracing the global jihad was seen as a way to keep more of these men under the Algerian group's control and recruit new members.
Then, in March 2004, a covert American military operation led to the capture of one of the group's top deputies. A few months later, Mr. Droukdal reached out to Mr. Zarqawi to get the man released. Mr. Zarqawi seized the opportunity to convince him that Al Qaeda could revive his operations, a former top leader of the Algerian group says.
Just as the Qaeda leadership has been able to reconstitute itself in Pakistan's ungoverned tribal areas, Al Qaeda's North Africa offshoot is now running small training camps for militants from Morocco, Tunisia and as far away as Nigeria, according to the State Department and Mr. Droukdal. The State Department in April categorized the tribal areas and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb as the two top hot spots in its annual report on global terrorism.
The threat is felt most acutely in Europe and in particular in France, which ruled Algeria for 132 years until 1962 and is a major trading partner with the authoritarian government in Algiers.
''We're under a double threat now,'' Bernard Squarcini, chief of France's domestic and police intelligence service, said in an interview. ''A group that had limited its terrorist activities to Algeria is now part of the global jihad movement.''
Last month, France signed military and nuclear development agreements with Algeria. Washington has also provided training to the Algerian military, and American companies have supplied equipment.
Even so, Western intelligence and diplomatic officials say the Algerian government has balked at making them full partners in investigating the group. Officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns.
In Europe, the authorities are eyeing the Algerian group warily, but are not convinced that the group can strike outside Africa.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said last week that the merger of Al Qaeda with the Algeria organization and others like it brought fresh risks.
''These groups, as best we can tell, have a fair amount of independence. They get inspiration, they get sometimes guidance, probably some training, probably some money from the Al Qaeda leadership,'' he said, adding that ''it's not as centralized a movement as it was, say, in 2001. But in some ways, the fact that it has spread in the way that it has, in my view, makes it perhaps more dangerous.''
Adopting Qaeda Tactics
Last Christmas Eve, five French tourists from Lyon were picnicking in midafternoon near the town of Aleg in Mauritania, some 1,700 miles southwest of Algiers. Suddenly, they were ambushed by three men in a black Mercedes. One of the gunmen turned an AK-47 on the tourists, killing four and wounding the fifth, French investigators said.
''It was total horror,'' said Francois Tollet, 74, a retired chemist who lost his two sons, a brother and a friend in the attack. He survived when the body of one of his sons fell on him. The gunmen fled across Senegal and Gambia before they were captured in an operation directed by French intelligence in Guinea-Bissau; agents determined that the men belonged to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. (Maghreb refers to the western edge of the Arab world.)
The attack reflected what officials and militants say are the group's tentacles in the northern tier of Africa. Camps in Mali, for example, are being used to begin operations in Algeria and Mauritania, according to French intelligence.
Mr. Droukdal described a growing network of militants only partly controlled by his far-flung deputies -- the kind of autonomous jihad cells that counterterrorism officials say are particularly hard to combat. His comments to The Times included an audio file that was verified by a private voice expert who works for federal agencies. The Times also reviewed a set of 12 photographs sent by the group to verify Mr. Droukdal's identity.
Asked about the slayings in Mauritania, he said, ''The brothers implementing the process are connected with us, and we have previously trained some of them, and we offer them adequate support for the implementation of such operations.''
The epicenter of the group remains in the hills east of Algiers, where the roads are blocked by skittish police officers who finger their rifle triggers when cars approach. ''Who told you to get out of the car?'' a checkpoint officer yelled at one driver, backing away as the other guards swung their weapons into the faces of the passengers.
Inside police headquarters in nearby Naciria, the commander said he was so busy battling militants that he had no time to hang photographs of three officers killed in recent suicide bombings. ''These terrorists don't know any mercy,'' he said. ''This is Al Qaeda, what do you think?''
Even as the group expands its ambitions beyond Algeria, parts of the country remain a bleak battleground between militants and an oppressive government that follows its citizens and limits political opposition.
The Algerian government killed or captured an estimated 1,100 militants last year -- nearly double the number in 2006, according to the State Department. But the group has begun using sophisticated recruitment videos to replenish its ranks with a new generation of youth that the State Department says is ''more hard-line.''
The group has also benefited from a national amnesty program. Wanted posters at police stations and checkpoints include numerous men who were pardoned and released only to join the new Qaeda franchise.
American military officials estimate that the group now has 300 to 400 fighters in the mountains east of Algiers, with another 200 supporters throughout the country. Led by Mr. Droukdal, 38, an explosives expert who joined the insurgency 12 years ago, the group has shifted to tactics ''successfully employed by insurgents and terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan,'' according to the State Department.
In adopting these Qaeda-style tactics, it staged at least eight suicide bombings with vehicles last year, including two sets of attacks in central Algiers on the 11th of April and December, dates that now fill Algerians with dread. It dispatched the country's first individual suicide bomber, who singled out President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria.
The group has also stepped up its use of remote-controlled roadside bombs, and there are increasingly deadly clashes with militias armed by the government to fight the militants.
''We don't arrest them anymore,'' said Mohammad Mendri, 65, the mayor of a village who leads a militia near the coastal city of Jijel. ''We just kill them.''
Its list of Western targets is growing. In December 2006, militants bombed a bus carrying workers with an affiliate of Halliburton, an American oil services company.
Other attacks killed Russian and Chinese workers. North African men trained in the group's camps shot at the Israeli Embassy in Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott. The group is also holding two Austrian tourists whom they kidnapped in Tunisia in February.
Its most audacious attack came last December when suicide bombers struck the United Nations and court offices in Algiers, killing 41 people and injuring 170 others. The attack drew praise from Mr. bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, who compared it to the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad by Mr. Zarqawi.
A Merger's Rocky Start
The on-and-off relationship between Al Qaeda and the Algerian militants began more than a decade ago. In 1994, Mr. bin Laden was looking for a new base to set up operations for his fledgling group. Algeria, with its rugged terrain and proximity to Europe, was an ideal spot.
Already, some 1,500 Algerian Islamists had returned home after helping the C.I.A. force the Soviets from Afghanistan. The men helped form a coalition of militants called the Armed Islamic Group. They took up arms in the insurgency against Algeria's military-backed government in a conflict that has left more than 100,000 dead.
Mr. bin Laden, in Sudan at the time, asked the militants to let him move to a mountainous area they controlled, according to Mr. Khettab, the former top militant leader. J. Cofer Black, who was stationed in Khartoum for the C.I.A., said he never heard this account, but found it plausible. ''We knew he was looking for some place to go,'' Mr. Black said.
Mr. Khettab said the militants turned down Mr. bin Laden. ''We refused, and said we don't have anything to do with anything outside,'' he said. ''We are interested in just Algeria.''
The West was already deeply concerned about the rise of radical Islam in Algeria. In 1991, an Islamic political party trounced Algeria's secular government in national polling, and the Algerian military blocked the elections.
Moderate Arab states, along with Europe and Washington, feared the installation of a fundamentalist Islamic republic on the model of Iran or Sudan and backed the government.
The crisis escalated further when violence spread to Europe. In late 1994, Armed Islamic Group gunmen hijacked an Air France jet bound for Paris intending to use it as a missile before they were killed during a stop in Marseille, according to French security officials. The following summer, three Paris bombings killed eight people and injured dozens.
Algeria's military turned to infiltrators to help defeat the group from within, according to accounts from three high-level defectors from the Algerian Army and security service. Several massacres of villagers, for which the Islamic group was blamed, were believed to have been arranged by the military.
Even Mr. bin Laden and his backers denounced civilian killings as counterproductive to their cause, and the group withered. In 1998 a faction of militants created a new organization, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat.
The new group revived the guerrilla war against the government, with minimal singling out of civilians, according to two United States Air Force officers at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., who analyzed 10 years of its operations through early 2006. Their study concluded that the group ''does not appear to be a 'terrorist' group as much as an internal insurgency against the government.''
The Bush administration took a different view of the group. On Sept. 23, 2001, President Bush included it on a list of organizations that ''commit, threaten to commit or support terrorism.''
Shifting Strategies
The terrorist designation rankled Salafist group members, but there was dissent over whether to stay focused on the fight with the Algerian government. Two years later, the group's leader, Nabil Sahraoui, issued a statement for the first time endorsing ''Osama bin Laden's jihad against the heretic America'' and expressing his desire that the group join Al Qaeda. By this time, a United States Air Force general had the Algerian group in his sights.
''Africa had emerged strategically to the United States,'' said Gen. Charles F. Wald, former deputy commander of the Pentagon's European Command, which had responsibility for Africa. ''A significant amount of our energy is going to be coming from Africa in the future.''
The wide open spaces of the Sahara where arms, drugs and cigarette smugglers roam and tribal law reigns were also seen as potential jihadist havens. In March 2003, 32 European tourists were kidnapped there by one of the militant group's top operatives.
''He was a very dynamic guy,'' General Wald said of the kidnapper, Amari Saifi, who is known as El Para. ''Could have played in a Hollywood movie. Handsome as hell. They'd take pictures of themselves out there posing.''
El Para got as much as $10 million in ransom, and General Wald said he decided to give chase. He tracked him for months through the deserts of Mali, Mauritania and Niger.
In early 2004, General Wald was hosting a meeting of African defense ministers in Stuttgart, Germany, when his aides saw El Para crossing into Chad. ''Right there in my office they negotiate a mission for the Chadians to go after these guys,'' the general said. El Para was captured in Chad in March 2004.
From their base in the mountains east of Algiers, militants were struggling on rations of beans and rice when news of the arrest came in. A strategy meeting was held on how to free El Para, according to a participant.
The idea was to press the French government, which in turn they hoped could press his Chadian captors, the participant said. Mr. Zarqawi was seen as a possible cudgel. In the fall of 2004, Mr. Droukdal, the group's new leader, sent Mr. Zarqawi the message that was crucial to their merger. He asked if Mr. Zarqawi could kidnap French citizens to trade for El Para.
''Zarqawi said, 'No problem; we will support you,' or something like this,'' recalled the former group member who said he saw the message. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized by the group to discuss the episode.
Before the plan was set in motion, El Para was handed over to Algeria, where he was recently sentenced to death. Nonetheless, Mr. Droukdal ''kept in touch, and Zarqawi invited him to become part of Al Qaeda,'' the former member said.
In his comments to The Times, Mr. Droukdal confirmed that Mr. Zarqawi played a ''pivotal role'' in the merger, along with other intermediaries. Mr. Droukdal explained his wrath toward the United States, saying: ''We found ourselves on the blacklist of the U.S. administration, tagged with terrorism. Then we found America building military bases in the south of our country, and conducting military exercises, and plundering our oil and planning to get our gas.'' (Navy surveillance planes have flown missions from the Tamanrasset air base in southern Algeria.)
In January 2005, Mr. Zarqawi began including Mr. Droukdal in his public statements praising Qaeda leaders. Officials in Washington and Europe confirmed that American intelligence agencies intercepted the message that Mr. Droukdal sent to Mr. Zarqawi.
According to a senior intelligence officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, the initial contact with Mr. Zarqawi was followed by communications with North African militants who had risen to senior posts in Al Qaeda's central leadership. They included Abu Laith al-Libi, a Libyan militant killed this year by an American airstrike near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
In September 2005, Mr. Droukdal declared France ''our No. 1 enemy, the enemy of our religion and of our community.'' A year later, the merger was formally announced by Mr. Zawahri, who said, ''Our brothers will be a bone in the throat of the American and French crusaders and their allies.''
Expansion to Europe
Last December, French officials arrested eight men from Paris suburbs and seized computers, electronic material, night-vision goggles, global positioning equipment, cellphones, weapons-making machinery and 20,000 euros, or about $30,000.
Investigators said they believed that the men, both French-Algerians and Algerian passport holders, were sending logistical equipment to support an attack to Algeria. Whether or not the case leads to convictions -- six of the men have been released -- investigators say they viewed the arrests as the first concrete link they had found between France and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known by its initials as AQIM.
The Spanish police said they made a similar discovery in June when they arrested eight Algerian-born men on suspicion of providing financial and logistical support to the Algerian group.
European investigators are examining a group of Tunisians with alleged ties to the North African Qaeda operation who are suspected of running a fund-raising and recruitment cell stretching from Paris to Milan. So far, despite its stated intentions to strike Europe and the rest of the West, investigators say they see little evidence that the North Africa branch of Al Qaeda is exporting fighters and equipment for an attack in Europe.
''Their ambition is to attack in Europe, but I wouldn't hard-sell it,'' said Gilles de Kerchove, the head of counterterrorism for the European Union. ''I wouldn't say AQIM is poised to attack in Europe.''
Although the Algerian government has been a ready trading partner with the West, it has been a reluctant ally in the West's effort against the Qaeda group. Algerian officials have declined to share key information on the United Nations bombing and have also refused to release the names of insurgents it freed from prison, according to American diplomatic and intelligence officials.
The F.B.I. recently opened an office in Algiers in an attempt to foster improved information-sharing between Algeria and the United States, as well as France. ''We're trying to make this like an extended family,'' said Thomas Fuentes, the F.B.I.'s director of international operations.
The tension between the Algerian government and its people continue. The government has reneged on public promises to spend more of its energy wealth on its unemployed youth who are prime recruits for Al Qaeda, according to American intelligence analysts. The Algerian government, which would not comment for this article, minimizes the threat. ''Terrorism has been vanquished, despite the sporadic manifestation we are facing up to in the most energetic manner,'' President Bouteflika told Reuters in March.
But there is new evidence that Qaeda commanders see potential in its North African franchise.
Intelligence agents intercepted yet another message between headquarters and the Algeria branch this year. Mr. Zawahri sent Mr. Droukdal a private message, according to a top German intelligence official, noting that controversial Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad were set to be republished. He asked Mr. Droukdal to help in taking revenge.
Correction: July 5, 2008, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Tuesday with the continuation of a front-page article about an Algerian militant group misspelled the given name of an American who was kidnapped by the group. The American, shown holding a photograph of his captors, is Harald Ickler, not Harold.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding At 9/11 Site Runs Late, Report Says

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At the World Trade Center site, the memorial to the people who died on Sept. 11, 2001, will not be open to the public in time for the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, as had been previously announced.
The $2.5 billion PATH station and transit hub nearby are not only behind schedule and over budget, but the final design is not even finished.
On the south side of the site, the demolition of the Deutsche Bank tower will not be completed until sometime next year, at least 14 months behind schedule.
For at least a year, some officials involved in the rebuilding effort have hinted that delays for any one of the 26 separate but interrelated projects on the 16 acres were compounding. But on Monday, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, issued a 34-page report listing the site's problems, saying, ''The schedule and cost for each of the public projects on the site face significant delays and cost overruns.'' 
The Port Authority adamantly refused to offer new schedules or cost estimates, but some officials said the delays could run up to three years. The cost overruns could extend into the billions for a project whose total cost is now more than $15 billion.
At the heart of the problem, the report said, were overly ambitious completion dates that were probably inaccurate from the day they were announced. Those dates were set at a time when former Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the Port Authority wanted to convey the sense that this most politically, economically and emotionally significant of projects would be completed quickly.
The report also illuminated in great detail just why that schedule was so inaccurate: The work entails more than two dozen projects, some of them large and extremely complex, all within the confines of a dozen square blocks. Nineteen public agencies, two private developers and 101 construction contractors and subcontractors are involved.
Although Port Authority officials publicly acknowledged the daunting problems on Monday, they were also eager to convey the sense that some progress was being made on the centerpiece, the 1,776-foot-tall Freedom Tower, as well as on three other office towers, the transit hub and the foundations for the memorial.
''The World Trade Center site is being rebuilt, will continue to be rebuilt, and it will be completed,'' Christopher O. Ward, executive director of the Port Authority, said on Monday. ''The question surrounding the World Trade Center rebuilding is not if all of the projects will be built, rather when and for how much.''
At the same time, Mr. Ward conceded that ''there will clearly be some triage,'' meaning some projects at ground zero may have to be delayed while others are accelerated. The PATH station designed by Santiago Calatrava will have to be revised, he said. Public officials will also have to decide how to keep the station for the No. 1 subway line at the site from impeding construction that is only inches away.
At a news conference on Monday, Gov. David A. Paterson, who had asked the Port Authority for the report on the overall rebuilding effort, painted a grim picture. He said past estimates and schedules had been so unrealistic, and so much essential information remained unknown, that even now, the authority would not set a completion date.
Instead, Mr. Paterson said, he had ordered that all stakeholders in the effort meet to find a way to centralize decision-making about the site. The goal, he said, was to come up with a more realistic schedule and budgets by Sept. 30.
''Here's what we're not going to do,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''We're not going to give any phony dates or timetables at this point and then follow it up with phony ribbon-cuttings and encouraging words and no follow-up.''
Mr. Paterson also said there would be no casting of blame for the rebuilding delays.
''I don't know that it would be important to assess that it was the fault of people or that they were irresponsible,'' he said. ''I think, all in all, everyone was trying to do the right thing.''
Still, the reference to phony ribbon-cuttings and the like amounted to a rebuke of Mr. Pataki, who was in office in 2001 and viewed the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan as a central element of his 12-year legacy.
''For years, unrealistic deadlines were set,'' said Julie Menin, chairwoman of Community Board 1, whose district includes the site. ''There seemed to be more interest in having press conferences declaring how Lower Manhattan would be rebuilt better than ever, than in establishing realistic deadlines and budgets. Now we're in a situation where projects could be stalled, or are years away from being completed.''
Ms. Menin said tension between the Pataki and Bloomberg administrations also contributed to the delays. ''There were times when literally the city and state each separately would call me to say they did not want to sit at the same table when presenting at a community board meeting,'' she said.
David Catalfamo, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, dismissed the criticism, saying: ''From Day 1, Governor Pataki insisted on an aggressive schedule for ground zero. It was important to put a schedule out there to keep the process moving. We encourage them to continue to be aggressive.''
In comments to reporters on Monday, Mayor Bloomberg seemed to downplay the overall significance of the delays. ''It is very difficult to forecast in such a complex development project any kind of realistic date and cost,'' he said. ''We want to have a design for the World Trade Center site that we will look back on 50 years from now and say that they did it right.''
The prospect of delays and overruns has long been evident, despite assurances by the Port Authority as recently as this April that the project would proceed on schedule. In April 2007, the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center, which was established by Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg, issued a thick internal assessment suggesting that an underground center for screening vehicles entering the site, the PATH station and the memorial museum could be more than four years behind schedule and over budget.
Eliot Spitzer, then the governor, and Anthony E. Shorris, then the executive director of the Port Authority, rebuffed a recommendation by Avi Schick, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, to make that assessment public. Mr. Shorris and Mr. Spitzer feared that they would lose leverage with contractors and make any delays inevitable if they revised the schedules and budgets for the project.
Monday's announcement did not make it any easier for the developer, Larry Silverstein, to market the three office towers, with a total of 6.2 million square feet of space, that he is building on the site. In a statement he released after the Port Authority board meeting on Monday, Mr. Silverstein said: ''As of today, my company's projects are fully designed and on schedule. Construction of Towers 3 and 4 is under way, and all three buildings are slated for completion, as projected, by the end of 2012.''
There is little doubt that rebuilding the World Trade Center is an enormously complex task. There are plans for five major skyscrapers with roughly as much office space as downtown Atlanta; the third-largest transportation hub in New York City; two new city streets; a major performing arts center; and more than 500,000 square feet of shops.
The Port Authority report does not say how long some projects could be delayed or revise its estimates for how much the rebuilding will cost. It expects to answer those questions by September, when it plans to issue the second part of its report. Final designs must also be completed then for the PATH station and the memorial.
Many parts of the project are interconnected. Construction of the vehicle-screening center cannot be finished until the long-delayed demolition of the former Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty Street is completed. Holdups in negotiations with a nearby Greek Orthodox church, which was destroyed in the terrorist attack, have also slowed progress on the screening center. An office tower for JPMorgan Chase is planned for the Deutsche Bank site, while a portion of the screening center will sit below the rebuilt church.
''The World Trade Center site is so complex because of the infrastructure that runs underneath it and the requirements for rebuilding that no one should be surprised that the commercial development and the memorial will take longer than originally anticipated,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University. ''There was an overemphasis on speed which is being superseded by a more realistic timetable.''

HEADLINE: Work Stalls At Job Sites By a Strike Few Predicted

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Sharon Otterman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Most of New York City's largest construction projects ground to a halt or near-halt on Tuesday because of an unanticipated strike by more than 400 cement-truck drivers. 
 With the bulky, noisy ready-mix concrete trucks largely disappearing from the city's streets, the walkout affected scores of projects, including the Freedom Tower; the Second Avenue subway; the new Yankee Stadium; Citi Field, the ballpark that will replace Shea Stadium; and many high-rise apartment buildings.
 The concrete companies hit by the strike predicted that the walkout would last at least through Monday and perhaps considerably longer, putting thousands of construction workers temporarily out of work. 
 ''The strike was a surprise because it seemed that the negotiations were going well until the 11th hour and then it fell apart,'' said John Quadrozzi, president of the Quadrozzi Concrete Corporation, which has 50 trucks and calls itself the city's largest concrete company. ''At a time when the city is complaining about construction being behind at the World Trade Center site and the economy being in a downturn, we feel it's not the right time for the union to take such a strong position in this type of negotiations.''
 Carolyn Daly, a spokeswoman for the striking union, Local 282 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said the main issues were wages and working conditions. She said the union expected the strike to last only a few days, adding, ''The posture is positive; it's not angry.''
 Joseph Greco Jr., treasurer of the Association of New York City Ready Mix Concrete Producers, saw the situation in a more negative light. ''The union has informed us that they will not be contacting us to have additional negotiations until next week,'' he said.
 As a result of the drivers' strike, construction was all but shut down Tuesday on a project to erect a six-story building for New York Law School at West Broadway and Leonard Street. Across the street, concrete work on the fourth floor of a planned nine-story condominium building had also been halted.
 Victor Buono, a foreman on the condo project, said it looked as if a lot of workers would be forced to prematurely begin a very long July Fourth weekend. 
 ''A good group of the guys, 30 or 40 of them, aren't coming in tomorrow,'' Mr. Buono said. ''We're just having a skeleton crew.''
 The two sides engaged in intense bargaining until 12:30 a.m. Tuesday at Local 282's headquarters in Lake Success, N.Y., but then the union informed the concrete companies that it was walking out. The contract expired at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.
 ''Teamsters Local 282 regrets that it was unable to reach an agreement,'' Bruce Levine, the lead lawyer for the union, said in a statement. ''Local 282 is particularly disappointed because in the past month, it has succeeded in reaching innovative, far-reaching and fair agreements with hundreds of employers'' that handle demolition as well as lumber, steel and other non-concrete building materials.
 Construction is continuing at nonunion projects, which are generally smaller than the unionized sites affected by the strike. Work continued at some unionized sites where all the concrete had been poured, allowing laborers to do interior work or work on heating and air-conditioning.
 Mr. Greco, who is also the secretary-treasurer of the Greco Brothers Concrete Corporation, said that under the expired contract, drivers earned $33.11 an hour, rising to $59.01 when health insurance, pension contributions and other benefits are included.
 He said the union earlier this week demanded raises of $5 an hour in the overall compensation package each year for three years, although the union did not specify how much would go to wages and how much to benefits.. 
 Mr. Greco said that during Monday's bargaining, Gary La Barbera, Local 282's president, reduced that demand to $3.50 an hour. 
 ''They didn't give us a chance to answer the $3.50 package before they walked out,'' Mr. Greco said.
 That $3.50 would represent a 6 percent increase in the drivers' $59-an-hour compensation package.
 ''That is absolutely not a correct number or a correct version of events,'' said a member of the union's bargaining team, who insisted on anonymity because union officials said they would not negotiate in the news media. ''And I'm surprised that a member of management's bargaining team would be saying these things in public.''
 Local 282 had long been notorious because the Gambino crime family controlled it for decades. But government officials placed it into trusteeship, and Mr. La Barbera was brought in to help root out corruption. Government officials say the cleanup has been quite successful. 
 Mr. Quadrozzi voiced keen frustration on Tuesday because his company is the primary concrete supplier to the Freedom Tower and PATH station at the former World Trade Center site. 
 ''We're shut down,'' he said. ''We have 50 beautiful trucks just sitting there in our parking lot.''

 U.S. AGREES TO LIFT IMMUNITY 
 For Contractors in Iraq
 In a briefing, Iraq's foreign minister said that the United States had agreed to lift immunity for foreign security contractors operating in Iraq. The foreign minister said that the agreement eliminated what had been a sticking point in negotiations on a security accord between Iraq and the United States. PAGE A11 
 UNITY URGED IN ZIMBABWE
 The African Union urged the creation of a government of national unity in Zimbabwe to heal the nation's deep political wounds after President Robert Mugabe's triumph in a one-candidate runoff election widely condemned as a sham. The resolution represented another departure from the continent's resistance to treating Mr. Mugabe as anything less than a hero of the struggle for liberation. PAGE A11 
 WORLD BANK LEADER CALLS FOR AID
 Warning in a letter that rising food and oil prices pose a crisis for the world's poor, Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, called on President Bush and other leaders who are assembling in Japan for an economic summit meeting to make new aid commitments to avert starvation and instability in dozens of countries. PAGE A10 
 NEW WOES IN UNION TREATY
 Poland cast fresh doubt on the future of the Lisbon Treaty to build a more united Europe, drawing a sharp response from France, which assumed the six-month leadership of the European Union with dwindling hopes of delivering substance. President Lech Kaczynski of Poland was asked if he would sign the treaty, which Irish voters rejected. He replied that the effort was ''now pointless.'' PAGE A10 
 DISCORD OVER TAXES IN ARGENTINA
 In Argentina, a political crisis erupted after the government raised export taxes for farmers, and it now threatens the government of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the country's Peronist president. The revolt of dozens of politicians shows how deeply the president's decision has divided even the Peronists, leaving them torn between their party loyalties and their furious constituents. PAGE A6 
 CHINA BLOCKING DISSIDENT ACTIVITY
 Two United States representatives who were in Beijing to lobby for the release of more than 700 political prisoners had hoped to have dinner with a group of Chinese human rights lawyers. But security agents had a different idea: they detained some of the lawyers and warned the others to stay away, which is the latest example of how Chinese security agents are increasing pressure on dissidents in advance of the Beijing Olympics in August.

 SEEKING REVIEW OF TESTIMONY 
 In Firefighters' Deaths
 John F. Wood, a federal prosecutor in Missouri, asked the Justice Department to review claims that several witnesses lied in the case surrounding a 1988 explosion in Kansas City that killed six firefighters. The announcement followed an article on Sunday in The Kansas City Star that raised questions about an investigator's tactics and whether the five people who were convicted of the crime were in fact guilty. PAGE A13 
 A MIXED BLESSING IN MONTANA
 The snow left over from record snowfalls in Montana has delayed the opening of a road that connects the two sides of Glacier National Park. It's a blow to the town of St. Mary's, Mont., which depends on income from tourists who drive the scenic road, but good news for other parts of the Northern Rockies, which have suffered through high temperatures and a withering drought. PAGE A16
 SETTLEMENTS IN SEXUAL ABUSE CASES
 The Archdiocese of Denver said it would pay $5.5 million to settle more than a dozen lawsuits over sexual abuse by priests. The settlements bring to 42 the number of abuse claims the archdiocese has settled since 2005 against two priests, the Rev. Harold Robert White and the Rev. Leonard Abercrombie. A third priest, the Rev. Lawrence St. Peter, was accused in a 43rd case that was also settled. But two more abuse lawsuits against the archdiocese have yet to be resolved. PAGE A16 
 EVERGLADES PLAN COULD HAVE FLAWS
 Florida's plan to buy nearly 300 square miles of land for Everglades restoration moved forward after water managers who would oversee the property endorsed its $1.75 billion offer. But skeptics say the state has bet a huge sum on oft-fertilized farmland that could take at least a decade and billions of dollars to rehabilitate. PAGE A12
 SCRUTINY FOR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 A federal watchdog agency is looking into hiring practices at the Justice Department, and the department is facing a lawsuit from a former law clerk who said he was rejected for a job because of his politics. The developments were prompted by a report from the department's inspector general, which found that department officials used ''political or ideological'' factors in picking lawyers for nonpartisan positions. PAGE A13 
 WEIGHING THREAT AT PLANTS
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission heard arguments from a California group that said the commission's staff had overlooked a category of potentially serious attacks by terrorists on nuclear plants. The commission, determined to dispose of the issue promptly, heard the arguments directly instead of delegating them as it normally would. PAGE A16

 DEMAND FOR OIL WILL CLIMB, 
 Along With Prices, Report Says
 A report by the International Energy Agency says global demand for oil is likely to keep growing -- so drivers won't get much relief at the gas pump. And though the agency said that oil consumption would dip in the United States and other developed countries over the next few years, that decline would be offset by an increase of consumption in developing countries.

 SHAKE-UPS AT MOODY'S
 Moody's Corporation announced that it was replacing Noel Kirnon, an executive in charge of its structured finance business at a subsidiary, and that some employees violated its code of conduct in rating complex European securities. The company said it would discipline and possibly fire the employees involved. Moody's continues to face intense scrutiny for its role in the credit crisis. PAGE C1 
 JUDGE RULES AGAINST WAL-MART
 A state judge in Minnesota ruled that Wal-Mart Stores violated state laws on wage matters more than two million times. Wal-Mart could face more than $2 billion in fines, and the judge has threatened to impose a $1,000 penalty for each violation. A spokesman for the retail giant said it was considering an appeal.

 CITY IS EMPLOYING CONTRACTOR 
 With Mob Ties, Affidavit Says
 An affidavit filed in federal court in Brooklyn suggests that officials with the Schiavone Construction Company, a contracting giant working on some of the largest public works projects in New York City, were involved with organized crime. Among the schemes alleged was a plan to evade a requirement that the company hire businesses owned by women on a big city project by using a front to funnel money to a mob-connected trucking executive.

 ONE HOSTESS'S NIGHTMARE
 Martha Nyakim Gatkuoth was a hostess at Tavern on the Green and the lead complainant in a federal discrimination lawsuit that the restaurant recently settled for $2.2 million. She says the restaurant had once seemed a dream come true, but became a place of daily dread where sexual and racial harassment was rife. PAGE B1 
 TRANSIT HUB DESIGN TRIMMED BACK
 As envisioned by the architect Santiago Calatrava, the enormous wings forming the roof of the main hall at the World Trade Center transportation hub were to swing open to the sky. But with budgets and timetables well beyond earlier estimates, the roof ''will no longer open and close,'' said the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. PAGE B1

 A PLANE CRASH THAT LED
 To a Shift in Government Powers
 When an American bomber plane on a secret mission fell from the sky, nine men died, and three of their widows sued the government for negligence. The book ''Claim of Privilege,'' by Barry Siegel, focuses on that case, which gave birth to the state secrets privilege, which allows the government to shut down litigation simply by invoking national security. And, Adam Liptak writes, the book ''conclusively demonstrates that the state secrets privilege was built on a lie.'' PAGE E9 
 A BIG-BUDGET MOVIE FORGES ON
 An actors' strike won't prompt a cease-fire in the War of the Machines. ''Terminator Salvation,'' the latest installment in the film franchise, is one of the high-profile projects pushing ahead amid talk of a shutdown by studios reluctant to schedule production beyond the expiration of a contract with the Screen Actors Guild. Those films have moved forward largely because the film industry's needs have overwhelmed any conviction that actors would walk out. PAGE E1 
 AT THE PRADO, A SURPLUS OF GOYA
 O.K., so the Prado announced that ''Colossus,'' the famous and much-reproduced Goya painting of a giant terrifying a landscape, was not, in fact, a Goya. Fortunately, writes Michael Kimmelman, the museum's ''Goya in Times of War'' exhibit clears up what the real thing looks like. ''It's much too big an exhibition, like so many shows,'' he writes. ''But then, an excess of Goya is not exactly an unbearable prospect.'' PAGE E1

 RUTH CARDOSO, 77
 She was among Brazil's leading intellectuals and feminists -- she wrote and taught extensively on subjects that included the lives of slum dwellers, social movements, urban violence, immigration and political mobilization -- before rather reluctantly becoming the country's first lady.

 DO THE FLAMES TASTE SWEET?
 Sure as the Blue Mountains They Do
 It starts with a word in Quecha, moves to a sweet flavor then finishes up with a burn across the tongue and a fire in the belly. Jerk's roots as a Taino Indian cooking tradition, and modified by escapees from the slave trade adding seasoning of their own, lives on. Allspice taken from the entire tree, from its bark to its berries, is a defining element in jerk. When you can see that cloud of smoke from the (maybe) illegal grills all the way out on the street you know you're in the right spot. Page F1 
 A VINTNER'S BLASPHEMY IT IS NOT
 Previously a move so gauche as to bring to mind being burned at the stake somewhere in New England, a chilled red wine may offer momentary relief from summer's blaze. When a white wine, a cold beer or even a moisture-beaded glass of lemonade just won't suffice, reach for that ice bucket. Where room temperature is relative, make a careful selection of vintage and enjoy. Page F1 
 ZEROING IN ON NEW YORK'S PIZZA
 A quest to make the perfect pizza in an electric oven was completed at the business end of a pair of garden shears. Electric ovens don't get nearly as hot as your average pizza oven. Jeff Varasano tried running the oven on the cleaning cycle, which maxes out the heat. All he had to do was disable the safety mechanisms that keep the door closed during the cycle -- and hope the house didn't burn down. Page F3

 Marc Ecko, the fashion designer who bid $752,467 for Barry Bonds's record-setting 756th home run ball, and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum are at odds over the terms of Ecko's offer to donate the ball. The museum says Ecko's ''donation'' was really a loan. Ecko's spokesman said that it was a misunderstanding, and that the ball's donation was not temporary. So now the controversial little ball is being driven to Cooperstown in the hope that a deal can be worked out. PAGE D4

HEADLINE: Construction Zone: Beware of Audacious Art

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Even with the cooling economy, there are a couple of things that New York City still has in abundance these days: artists and acres of condominium construction sites surrounded by wooden walls. On a recent night in Long Island City, Queens, the first found a mutually beneficial use for the second, called it a gallery and held an opening, with Cheez Doodles standing in for canapes.
 The name of the makeshift and, in this case, legal street art space might sound a little awkward: Gallerie Pulaski. But it is honest. The exhibition of work by more than 20 artists, most of them graffitists in good standing, has taken shape on the scaffolding-shaded plywood walls around a rising condo, just yards away from the busy ramps to the Pulaski Bridge spanning Newtown Creek. 
 These kinds of ubiquitous temporary walls, with their ''Post No Bills'' stencils, are not usually a preferred canvas for street artists because ''your work just gets whitewashed over in a second by the construction workers,'' said an artist who calls himself El Celso.
 But in this case El Celso and his friends, with permission and encouragement from a real estate developer, Simone Development Companies, and a nonprofit art group, Chashama, started working on the walls a couple of weeks ago with spray paint, paper, glue, Plexiglas, screws and contributions from several artists who have never displayed a work on the streets. The project quickly drew the attention of blogs like C-Monster.net that feature street art.
 The creators described the idea in a news release as a ''construction site beautification program'' and ''New York's first plein-air street gallery,'' open around the clock, seven days a week. As if they needed to, they added that the show -- called, of course, ''Post No Bills'' -- is ''free and open to the public'' until Aug. 31 or perhaps until the Hunters View condominiums are completed. (A banner advertising the building shows a beautiful woman kissing a man with the Manhattan skyline in the background and encourages prospective tenants to ''Live Like a Star.'')
 The opening got under way on Friday evening about 6 with a bang, a loud one, caused when a sport utility vehicle smashed into a van, or vice versa, as the two jockeyed for position getting onto the bridge in front of the exhibition. No one seemed to be hurt, but the police arrived in droves.
 ''This is kind of a crazy place,'' said El Celso, who along with an artist named Ian Farrell, the show's co-curator, recently helped create a huge authorized graffiti mural on another construction wall nearby, in a part of Long Island City where luxury apartment buildings seem to be sprouting on every corner.
 For ''Post No Bills'' they enlisted many of their friends who, like them, generally don't require an invitation to make art on private property. But they also included artists like James A. Willis, a painter who is represented by a gallery in Chelsea and who contributed an ominous charcoal drawing of a crossroads. Also featured, posthumously, is the work of Evelyn B. Metzger, a wealthy Upper East Side painter who died in her 90s in 2004 after a lifetime of prodigious output. (El Celso was given dozens of her studies on board that were being discarded by her family, and he now uses them, either untouched or embellished by him, as a kind of prefab street art.)
 El Celso and Mr. Farrell also decided to work with the ready-mades that were already affixed to the construction walls. Like the metal fire hydrant sign. (The exhibition label lists it as ''Fire Hydrant, Sign Company, 2008, industrial paint on metal.'') And the large, subtle text work that reads, ''To Anonymously Report Unsafe Conditions at This Work Site Call 311/Para Reportar Condiciones Peligrosas en un Sitio de Trabajo Llame al 311.'' The label for that one reads: ''Jenny Holzer, Construction Truism, 2008, industrial paint on metal.''
 ''We thought she would appreciate the humor,'' El Celso said of Ms. Holzer, whose text works reside in important museum collections around the world.
 As it turns out, mounting street art legally is sometimes not much easier than doing it under cover of night. An overzealous security guard for the condo project shut down the art-making one night, rebuffing all attempts at explanation. Police cruisers constantly stopped. El Celso also noted that he and other artists making an authorized mural in Bushwick, Brooklyn, this month were given tickets by the police after opening beers to celebrate the day's work. ''In Bushwick!'' he added.
 And about an hour into the opening on Friday, just as El Celso had the coals going nicely in the miniature Weber to make hot dogs for the growing crowd, a police car pulled up, and an officer ordered the fire extinguished. El Celso complied.
 ''I have to say,'' he said, ''it's really kind of a weird experience to be doing all of this legally.''

HEADLINE: Dispelling The Myths Of Summer

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
At some point over the last seven years, you have probably heard someone -- a friend, a business executive, the president of the United States -- say that the Sept. 11 attacks sent the American economy into a slump. It's an understandable enough notion, given that the attacks occurred in 2001 and a recession began that same year. 
 But it's simply incorrect. The economy started shrinking in March 2001, largely because of the hangover from the technology bust. The attacks did cause a sharp drop in the stock market, but if you were to go back and look at, say, the quarterly numbers on consumer spending, you wouldn't even know anything horrific had happened in September. By November, the economy was growing again.
 The current downturn -- and I'd say the odds that it's a true recession are about 75 percent -- has no one dominant mythology. Instead, there are several different myths starting to make the rounds. Just like the one about Sept. 11, they tend to make the economy's problems sound simpler than they really are. 
 Today's column will be my last until early September. I'm going to finish working on a couple of projects and then take paternity leave. Before heading off, I wanted to take a stab at predicting which economic fictions are likely to get the most air time over the rest of the summer. Forecasting may be a fool's game, but, to steal a line from William Safire, ''If you don't play, you can't win.'' So here goes.
 On Thursday morning, the Labor Department will release the latest jobs report, which is typically the most telling economic indicator. It covers the entire economy and gives a sense of how families are being affected by it. This week, economists are expecting yet another bad report, with a sixth straight month of job losses.
 But whatever the report shows, the job market is likely to remain weak through the end of the year, because employment generally continues to fall for months after a downturn has ended. That means we are soon going to start hearing a lot about layoffs. Big layoff announcements will be treated as a symbol of all that's supposedly wrong with the economy.
 Strangely enough, though, layoffs have very little to do with the economy's problems. Since 1992, the Labor Department has been tracking something called ''gross job losses,'' which is the number of positions eliminated at a given office or job site. In 2007, these losses were at nearly their lowest point on record, just above the 2006 level. That's right -- last year, companies eliminated significantly fewer jobs than they did in any year of the fabulous late 1990s boom.
 Unfortunately, gross job gains -- the new jobs created -- have fallen more sharply than job losses. Companies have gone on a ''hiring strike,'' notes Ed McKelvey, a Goldman Sachs economist. Existing firms aren't expanding much, and not enough new firms are starting. The country is suffering from an innovation deficit.
 Layoffs will almost certainly increase in coming months, and the pain, both financial and psychological, that comes with any individual layoff tends to be severe. The victims of these layoffs deserve help, in the form of extended unemployment benefits. But the long-term solution can't revolve around efforts to slow globalization, technological change and other forms of economic churn. We need more churn, not less. 
 If you want to understand the causes of the innovation deficit, I'd recommend adding one serious book to your summer reading list: ''The Race Between Education and Technology,'' by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, two labor economists. 
 They argue that the American prosperity of the 20th century sprang largely from the country's longtime lead in educational attainment, a lead that has all but vanished. Future prosperity won't be based on saving yesterday's high-wage jobs, as Mr. Katz told me. It has to start with smarter, more strategic investments in education, physical infrastructure and other things that can create the high-wage jobs of tomorrow. 
 The second big myth is the one that has been occupying Congress -- the idea that the spike in oil prices is a big mystery that can be explained only by market manipulation. Other writers have doneanicejob of debunking the manipulation argument. I'll stick to the reasons why the run-up, abrupt as it may feel, isn't mysterious.
 The world is now at the end of a 20-year energy cycle. From the mid-1980s to the middle of this decade, oil prices fell even as the world economy grew. A barrel of crude cost $68 in 1983 (adjusted for inflation) -- and just $33 in 2003. 
 How did this happen? The high prices of the early 1980s gave producers an incentive to take more oil out of the ground and also gave consumers reason to use less of it. With supply growing quickly and demand growing less quickly, prices plummeted.
 The low prices of the 1990s reversed those incentives. Americans fell in love with Hummers and pickup trucks, and the Chinese and Indian booms were fueled by cheap energy. Oil supplies, meanwhile, weren't growing so quickly. To top it off, the decline of the dollar since 2001 has reduced Americans' purchasing power. Without that fall, a barrel of oil would cost less than $110 today, rather than $141, according to Stephen P. A. Brown at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. 
 Oil prices may well fall at some point. But no speculation-hating senator can legislate oil back to $26 a barrel. It will stay expensive until the fundamentals -- supply and (more important, for the sake of the planet) demand -- change. 
 Another cycle that still has a way to go is the housing bust. Prices have fallen by more than 20 percent in some cities, which has made renters (like me) more willing to buy again. These price declines have also led some experts to start proclaiming that the real estate market is close to the bottom. 
 It isn't. By any measure -- prices relative to incomes, prices relative to rents, the number of homes languishing on the market -- houses are still overvalued. Come Labor Day, prices will still be falling. In some places, they'll still be falling by Labor Day 2009.
 The common thread in these myths is that they serve to minimize the scope of the economy's weakness. They make it sound as if the problems are acute -- job cuts, oil speculation, a little real estate overexuberance -- rather than fundamental. 
 Which brings me to the final myth. Pundits have been scratching their heads about why the public mood is so grim. Last week, Barron's called the drop in consumer confidence ''difficult to figure.'' A front-page headline in The Washington Post claimed, ''We're Gloomier Than the Economy.''
 But are we really?
 For the first time on record, an economic expansion seems to have just ended without most families having received a raise. For the first time on record, the typical home price nationwide is falling. The inflation-adjusted value of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has dropped 20 percent in the last year -- and 30 percent since its peak in 2000.
 I think the public has called this issue exactly right: the American economy has some real problems. Even if this summer's downturn turns out to be mild, those problems aren't mild -- or simple -- and they aren't going away anytime soon. It's going to take some real work. 
 See you in September.

HEADLINE: The Medicare Bidding Program

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Medicare Savings vs. the Lobbyists'' (editorial, June 25) and ''High Costs, Courtesy of Congress,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene, June 25), about the Medicare competitive bidding program for home medical equipment: 
 Congress is considering reforms to the bidding program for excellent reasons. As presently configured, the bidding program excludes some providers and will undoubtedly reduce access to care for Medicare beneficiaries. 
 The reforms to the program proposed by Congress would preserve quality of care and save taxpayers every dime that the flawed bidding program would have reaped in reduced payments. 
 Your editorial dismisses as ''overblown'' the concerns expressed by patient groups like the A.L.S. Association, the United Spinal Association and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
 Moreover, pricing for home medical equipment and services for Medicare beneficiaries cannot be benchmarked to the cost of equipment purchased over the Internet. That comparison ignores the costs of the essential services required in providing quality home care to the elderly and people with disabilities.

HEADLINE: Oil Demand to Grow Despite Prices, Report Says

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
World demand for oil should continue to climb, despite the doubling of oil prices and weakening economic growth, according to a report released Tuesday by the International Energy Agency.
 That should mean tightening supplies, decreasing the odds that drivers will get much relief at the gasoline pump.
 The Paris-based agency, which advises governments of the industrialized countries, predicted that oil consumption would decline slightly in the United States and other developed countries over the next couple of years. Americans, the report said, are beginning to drive more fuel-efficient vehicles and taking mass transit when it is available. 
 But the small decline in oil demand in the industrialized countries will be more than offset by an estimated increase in demand of 3.7 percent a year from 2008 to 2013 in developing countries, particularly in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
 ''The report is only further confirmation of the inability of global supply to catch up with rising demands,'' said Chris Ruppel, an energy analyst at Execution, an institutional brokerage firm. ''After five years of record increases in oil prices, producers are still unable to sufficiently expand output. It means we are in for rough times.'' 
 The report said energy consumption was increasing in developing countries because of increased trade, growing internal markets and strong commodity prices. But subsidies that typically shield gasoline consumers in developing countries, the report said, are also important in sustaining strong demand, particularly in oil-producing countries. 
 By 2013, oil demand in developing countries will account for nearly 49 percent of total global demand, the report said, compared with 36 percent as recently as 1996. 
 Demand will rise the most in China, as it has since 2004. ''China will account for almost a third of the world's annual demand increase in the 2008-2013 period,'' the report said. That projection is based on International Monetary Fund predictions of double-digit annual economic growth rates in China for the foreseeable future.
 The global picture for oil production is little better. High prices have stimulated exploration and field development, but the agency projects an increase in annual global production capacity of 1.5 million to 2.5 million barrels a day by 2010 from current levels, or roughly twice the current production in the Gulf of Mexico. After that, the agency expects annual growth below one million barrels a day from 2011 to 2013.
 Those modest increases result from project delays and exploding costs for many oil field projects around the world, declining production in major fields in Mexico and the North Sea, and political turbulence in Nigeria and other producing countries.
 There are some bright spots for supplies; at least 250 major new field or field expansion projects are expected to begin production in the next few years in non-OPEC countries alone. Spare capacity in OPEC countries is projected to rise from 2.5 million barrels a day in 2008 to more than 4 million barrels a day in 2010, although that will still be less than 5 percent of global demand. Production growth is robust in Brazil, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iraq.
 But the agency predicted that the tight markets would keep prices high. And it discounted the impact of speculation, which has been blamed by many politicians in the United States recently for the spike in prices.
 ''Blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids taking the necessary steps to improve supply-side access and investment or to implement measures to improve energy efficiency,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: Exports Lift Manufacturing; Construction Spending Falls

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A measure of manufacturing activity in the United States has grown for the first time in five months in June, but mostly because of strong exports.
 The reading of 50.2 from the Institute for Supply Managementsurvey was up from 49.6 in May. It beat economists' prediction of a reading of 48.7, according to the consensus estimate of Wall Street economists surveyed by Thomson Financial/IFR. A reading above 50 signals growth. 
 For the previous four months, the index had hovered near its lowest level in five years.
 Also on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending fell in May for the 11th time in the last year as a continuing slump in housing offset strength in nonresidential building.
 Construction spending dropped 0.4 percent in May, slightly less than had been expected. There was strength in spending on hotels and office buildings but continued declines in housing, which has been in a slump for two years.
 Residential construction dropped 1.6 percent in May, the 25th decline out of the last 26 months.
 Home builders have been frantically slashing back on their production in the face of the worst slump in housing in more than two decades. Analysts believe housing activity will keep falling for some time because even with the cutbacks in production, the backlog of unsold homes is remaining near record levels. The problem is that a rising tide of foreclosures is forcing even more properties onto the already glutted market.
 Private nonresidential construction rose 0.2 percent in May to an all-time high of $405.3 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. The small increase followed even bigger 1.6 percent gains in both April and March.
 The strength in May reflected a big increase in spending on hotels and motels and a smaller advance in office construction. These gains helped to offset declines in spending on shopping centers and amusement and recreation centers.
 Economists believe that strength seen recently in nonresidential construction will not last. They are concerned that a severe credit crunch occurring as banks tightening standards in the wake of rising mortgage defaults will begin to squeeze nonresidential building projects as well.
 Spending on government projects rose by 0.4 percent to a record of $301.1 billion at an annual rate in May. A gain of 0.6 percent in state and local building projects offset a 1.7 percent drop in federal construction spending.
 The 0.4 percent drop in overall construction spending represented the 11th decline in the last year and left total construction spending at $1.085 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.

HEADLINE: Apartment Sales Remain Vigorous in Manhattan

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Despite slowing sales and continuing economic worries, market studies released yesterday showed that the Manhattan co-op and condominium market remained strong in the peak spring selling season, with prices up 25 percent or more compared with a year ago, and overall prices roughly flat or just below record levels. 
 Average prices reached about $1.67 million for a Manhattan apartment in the second quarter, 1 percent to 3 percent below the record levels reported in the previous quarter, according to the series of competing market studies prepared by the major brokerage firms in New York City. 
 But these figures include a number of closings over the winter at two immensely expensive new condominium projects -- the Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue and 15 Central Park West -- that drove up average prices in the first quarter. 
 When these high-end sales were excluded for the second quarter, Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist of both Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, said his figures still showed that average sales prices were actually up about 5 percent over the first quarter. ''Prices are at incredibly high levels,'' Mr. Heym said. 
 Yet Mr. Heym and other analysts said there was increasing concern that prices would remain flat or perhaps decline over the next year, especially if the economy continued to weaken. So far, he said, despite reports of recent and impending layoffs, the local economy has ''yet to show any real weakness.''
 While luxury sales remained very strong, the reports showed slowing sales and weakening prices for studios and one-bedroom apartments, where buyers are extremely sensitive to tighter lending requirements and larger down payments now being demanded by mortgage lenders.
 The number of sales dropped sharply, by about 22 percent, compared with the second quarter of 2007, which was a record year for sales, according to an analysis released by Prudential Douglas Elliman. But at the same time, the number of sales was higher compared with the same period in 2006.
 The inventory of unsold apartments rose to 9,968 in the second quarter, 21 percent higher than the year before, according to a tally by the Corcoran Group. But the total number of apartments listed for sale in June had fallen by 1.2 percent since April, and was reported to be below inventory levels of several years ago. 
 Strong luxury sales and faltering studio sales had the perverse effect of catapulting the median price -- the price of the apartment exactly in the middle of all sale prices -- to a record. It was close to or slightly above $1 million, depending on the report.
 The report by Prudential Douglas Elliman found that average co-op prices fell by 8 percent compared with a year before, to $1.28 million, while the average condo price fell by 2.3 percent, to $1.94 million.
 Pamela Liebman, the president and chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said there was ''a lot of pressure on one-bedrooms and studios'' but that ''anyone who thinks price appreciation is over in this market is dreaming.''
 The flat sales picture has led many brokers to look back on 2007 as the golden age of Manhattan real estate, when inventory was falling and prices were rising regularly to new records. 
 Ms. Liebman said that while ''everything was perfect in 2007,'' the party was far from over. ''It is still a party,'' she said. ''We are just not serving Cristal.''
 Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Inc, an appraisal firm, who prepares the market report for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that the decline in average prices was the first since the fall of 2006, and could augur a turning point in the market. 
 ''We are looking at several years of lackluster performance at best,'' Mr. Miller said.
 Dorothy Herman, president and chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that ''obviously the frenzy mentality is gone,'' and she predicted that the market would be flat or down slightly during the rest of the year. 
 She said buyers were cautious and price sensitive, and lenders were requiring a lot more cash down. Still, she said, ''New York was different from the rest of the country,'' and she said that bidding wars over well-priced apartments would continue. ''I don't think New York is going to collapse,'' she said. 
 For the first time, the report by the Corcoran Group distinguished sales of new condo and co-op apartments from sales of existing apartments, which is similar to the way real estate sales data is collected across the country. 
 The report found that the average sales price of existing apartments rose 10 percent compared with a year ago, to $1.43 million, and fell 8 percent from the first quarter. But average sale prices at new developments rose to $2.2 million, a 61 percent increase from a year ago, and a 17 percent increase from the first quarter. 
 In Brooklyn, the report found that co-op and condo prices rose 5 percent in the first half of 2008 compared with a year earlier, to an average of $621,000. In Williamsburg, where the prices were highest, the average price fell by 26 percent. The average price of a single-family town house fell by 17 percent in Brooklyn, to $1.2 million.
 Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that the market reports reflected closed sales, based on contracts that were signed in the last 3 to 12 months. But based on contracts signed recently, he said that sales were off 16 percent this year, but the total value of sales was roughly equal to the total value of sales a year ago. 
 ''If properties are priced within their value range, they sell and they sell well,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Not Winning the War on Drugs

 BODY:
According to the White House, this country is scoring big wins in the war on drugs, especially against the cocaine cartels. Officials celebrate that cocaine seizures are up -- leading to higher prices on American streets. Cocaine use by teenagers is down, and, officials say, workplace tests suggest adult use is falling. 
 John Walters, the White House drug czar, declared earlier this year that ''courageous and effective'' counternarcotics efforts in Colombia and Mexico ''are disrupting the production and flow of cocaine.'' 
 This enthusiasm rests on a very selective reading of the data. Another look suggests that despite the billions of dollars the United States has spent battling the cartels, it has hardly made a dent in the cocaine trade. 
 While seizures are up, so are shipments. According to United States government figures, 1,421 metric tons of cocaine were shipped through Latin America to the United States and Europe last year -- 39 percent more than in 2006. And despite massive efforts at eradication, the United Nations estimates that the area devoted to growing coca leaf in the Andes expanded 16 percent last year. The administration disputes that number. 
 The drug cartels are not running for cover.
 Mexico and parts of Central America are being swept up in drug-related violence. Latin Americans are becoming heavy consumers of cocaine, and traffickers are opening new routes to Europe through fragile West African countries. Some experts argue that the rising price of cocaine on American streets is mostly the result of a strong euro and fast-growing demand in Europe. 
 Workplace drug tests notwithstanding, cocaine use in the United States is not falling. About 2.5 percent of Americans used cocaine at least once in 2006, the same percentage as in 2002, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
 While cocaine use has fallen among younger teenagers, 12th graders are using more: 5.2 percent used cocaine last year -- up from 4.8 percent in 2001 and 3.1 percent at the low point in 1992, says a Monitoring the Future survey done by the University of Michigan. 
 All this suggests serious problems with a strategy that focuses overwhelmingly on disrupting the supply of drugs while doing far too little to curb domestic demand. 
 Washington spent $1.4 billion on drug-related foreign assistance last year -- mostly to equip Colombia's security forces and spray coca crops in the Andes. It spent another $7 billion on drug-related law enforcement and interdiction efforts at home and abroad. It spent less than $5 billion on education, prevention and treatment programs at home to curtail substance abuse. 
 The counternarcotics effort has produced some successes. Marijuana use in the United States has declined since 2002, the earliest year for which the government has comparable data. Teenage use of other drugs, like methamphetamine, has fallen sharply. With American aid, Colombia's armed forces have severely weakened the FARC guerrillas, a major player in the drug trade. 
 The next administration should continue to help Latin American governments take on the traffickers. But it must learn from the current strategy's shortcomings. 
 Eradication efforts are most likely to have more success if more money is spent on programs to wean coca growers from the business and improve the lives of their families and communities. Mexico, in particular, is in deep trouble, and the next American president should build on the Bush administration's plans to provide counternarcotics aid. There needs to be a different mix: less money for equipment for security forces and more for economic development and programs to reform and strengthen Mexico's judicial system. 
 Above all, the next administration must put much more effort into curbing demand -- spending more on treating drug addicts and less on putting them in jail. Drug courts, which sentence users to treatment, still deal only with a small minority of drug cases and should be vastly expanded. Drug-treatment programs for imprisoned drug abusers, especially juvenile offenders, must also be expanded. 
 Over all, drug abuse must be seen more as a public health concern and not primarily a law enforcement problem. Until demand is curbed at home, there is no chance of winning the war on drugs.

HEADLINE: Starbucks Announces It Will Close 600 Stores

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
In a harsher economic climate, Starbucks's green-and-white mermaid logo is about to become a little less ubiquitous.
 The company, the world's largest coffee chain, said Tuesday that it would close 600 stores in the United States beginning this year. It will lay off more than 12,000 employees in the process, the most in its history. 
 The plan builds on an earlier decision to close 100 stores, which are included in Tuesday's numbers. Starbucks is retrenching in an effort to recapture the once-mighty growth it built upon venti soy lattes.
 A cavalcade of economic troubles, from imploding housing markets to rising gas prices, has pinched consumers, hurting not just Starbucks but nearly all retailers. The chain is struggling to attract customers for the afternoon frappuccinos they once bought eagerly, said Sharon Zackfia, an analyst at William Blair & Company.
 ''I don't think it's overly surprising,'' she said of the announcement. ''These stores were in aggregate unprofitable.''
 Shares in Starbucks rose as high as $16.53 in after-hours trading Tuesday after closing at $15.62. They have fallen about 24 percent this year.
 For years, Starbucks was known for aggressive growth, opening some stores only a few city blocks away from others. As of Sept. 30, the company operated 6,793 outlets in the United States, according to a regulatory filing. About 70 percent of the stores that will be closed have been open for fewer than three years. 
 As financial stumbles took a toll on the stock price, Starbucks's former chairman and chief executive, Howard Schultz, reclaimed the company's reins in January. Starbucks said in May that its second-quarter profit fell 28 percent, to $108.7 million, in what was its weakest quarter as a public company.
 In addition to the cutbacks, Starbucks said it would open fewer than 200 new stores in the United States next fiscal year, down from the 250 initially planned.
 Starbucks said that it could take up to $348 million in charges and write-offs related to the closings, including costs tied to lease terminations and severance payments.
 Starbucks began scrutinizing its stores' performance this year, Peter J. Bocian, the company's chief financial officer, said Tuesday in a conference call. Though he said there were no additional plans to close stores on such a broad scale, Mr. Bocian said that the company would continue to examine its options.
 ''We believe we've improved the profit potential of the U.S. store portfolio,'' Mr. Bocian said. ''We continue to take action in areas we can continue to control.''
 Mr. Bocian said Starbucks would continue to focus on expanding internationally.
 It is too early to tell if Starbucks's other efforts to rejuvenate its business, including introducing new products like fruit smoothies, are working, said Ms. Zackfia, the analyst. The company has been successful with its introduction of Pike Place, a mild drip-blend coffee.

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''America's Next Chapter'' (Op-Ed, June 25): 
 In his thoughtful article about the cyclical nature of American politics, Gary Hart describes three urgent directions that should shape the next cycle of American leadership: a redefinition of national security priorities (the focus of the Hart-Rudman Commission), a transition from a consumer to a producer economy, and stewardship of the environment. 
 I wholeheartedly agree with this list for whoever is the next president, but respectfully suggest that there is a fourth area, that is, in fact, a predicate for successful achievement of all the others. 
 That area is education and, in particular, science education.
 Improving science literacy and advancing scientific achievement in the United States will form the essential foundation for addressing national security, innovation and economic growth, and environmental stewardship, among many other critical challenges of the 21st century. 
 And education can be the engine to lift all of America's diverse populace to greater understanding of the world around us, higher personal capacity and deeper civic engagement.

HEADLINE: Deepening Cycle Of Job Loss Seen Lasting Into '09

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
As automakers dropped their latest batch of awful sales numbers on the market on Tuesday, reinforcing the gloom spreading across the economy, the troubles confronting American workers seemed to intensify. 
 Plummeting home prices have in recent months eliminated jobs for hundreds of thousands of people, from bankers and real estate agents to construction workers and furniture manufacturers. Tighter lending standards imposed by banks in the wake of huge mortgage losses have made it hard for many Americans to secure credit -- the lifeblood of expansion in recent years -- crimping the appetite of consumers, whose spending amounts to 70 percent of the economy.
 Joblessness has accelerated, and employers have slashed working hours even for those on their payrolls, shrinking the size of paychecks just as workers need them the most.
 Now, add to that unsavory mix the word from automakers that sales plunged in June -- by 28 percent for Ford, 21 percent for Toyota and 18 percent for General Motors -- a sharp sign that consumers are pulling back, making manufacturers more likely to cut production and impose more layoffs. Until recently, the weak labor market has been marked more by the reluctance of employers to create new jobs than by mass layoffs. 
 Among economists, the sense is broadening that the troubles dogging the economy will be stubborn, leaving in place an uncomfortable combination of tight credit and scant job opportunities perhaps well into next year.
 ''It's a slow-motion recession,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''In a normal recession, things kind of collapse and get so weak that you have nowhere to go but up. But we're not getting the classic two or three negative quarters. Instead, we're expecting two years of sub-par growth. Growth that's not enough to generate jobs. It's kind of a chronic rather than an acute pain.''
 Mr. Harris expects tepid economic growth and a shrinking labor market to persist through the fall of 2009.
 The national unemployment rate climbed a full percentage point over the last year to 5.5 percent in May, according to the Labor Department. That does not include people who are jobless and have given up looking for work, or people who have been bumped to part-time jobs from full-time. Add in those people and the so-called underemployment rate rises to 9.7 percent, up from 8.3 percent in May 2007, according to the Labor Department.
 Goldman Sachs forecasts that the unemployment rate will peak at 6.4 percent late in 2009 before the picture improves, meaning that the painful process of shedding jobs may be only half-way complete.
 ''The labor market is clearly deteriorating, and it's highly likely to keep deteriorating,'' said Andrew Tilton, an economist at Goldman Sachs. ''It's clear that the housing downturn and credit crunch are still very much under way. Clearly, there are more jobs to be lost in housing, finance and construction -- hundreds of thousands of more jobs to be lost collectively.''
 On Thursday, the Labor Department will release its snapshot of the job market for June. Economists generally expect the report to show 60,000 more jobs lost, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline. 
 But many anticipate the unemployment rate will nudge down a little bit, swinging back from an abrupt climb that could have been exaggerated by survey glitches in the previous month, when the rate jumped by half a percentage point -- the sharpest one-month spike in 22 years.
 If the unemployment rate were to hold steady or rise, that would likely spook markets, underscoring the impact of the economic slowdown. 
 ''Slowing wage growth and falling employment is absolutely toxic if your business is selling anything to consumers,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics.
 Recent indications lend credence to the view that the job market is in the grip of a sustained downturn. Three weeks in a row, new unemployment claims have exceeded 380,000, a level generally associated with recession. Construction spending fell in May. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey, which tracks attitudes about business and personal finance, has dropped to a depth last seen in 1980. 
 On the factory floor, a weak dollar has been fanning export sales. The I.S.M. Manufacturing Index -- a widely watched gauge of factory activity -- nudged up in June to 50.2 from 49.6 in May, entering barely positive territory, which indicates a slight expansion. 
 But that mostly reflected a buildup of inventories and higher prices for raw materials, and not an improvement in orders for factory goods, said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Service Group in a note to clients. If business stays weak and orders do not materialize, factory layoffs could accelerate. Indeed, the employment component of the index declined to its lowest level in five years.
 The slide in the labor market has become both symptom and cause of a weak economy, pulling many families into a downward spiral. Back when housing prices were still rising, Americans borrowed exuberantly against the value of their homes to finance renovations, vacations and shopping sprees. But that artery of finance has constricted considerably along with access to credit cards, forcing a reversion to the traditional limits of household finance. Millions of American families must now confine their spending to what they can bring home from work.
 With job losses growing and working hours shrinking, many paychecks are eroding, prompting millions of families to cut their spending. Soaring prices for food and gasoline are overwhelming modest wage gains for most workers, leaving households with even less money to spend. All of which deprives struggling businesses of sales, prompting them to shed more workers, sending the cycle down another turn. Starbucks announced on Tuesday that it would close stores and eliminate up to 12,000 jobs, about 7 percent of its work force.
 The fear of a downward spiral prompted the Bush administration to unleash $100 billion worth of tax rebates in the hopes that recipients would spend money and spur sales. The Treasury has already dispensed more than $78 billion, and the money appears to be finding its way into cash registers, with consumer spending climbing by 0.8 percent in May, according to the Commerce Department. 
 Economists expect the rebates will continue to help retail sales through the summer, fueling modest economic growth that spares some jobs and prevents an outright contraction.
 But few expect these rebate-laced sales to expand the job market, because businesses understand that the one-time surge of money will wear off later this summer.
 Many experts expect the economy to then be pulled back into the weeds by the same forces that have led the downturn -- declining home prices, tighter credit and leaner paychecks.
 ''It's going to be very hard to overcome those headwinds,'' said Mr. Harris, the Lehman economist.

HEADLINE: Quake Revealed Deficiencies of China's Military

BYLINE: By JAKE HOOKER

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
They were 19-year-old farm boys wearing cloth shoes and carrying rucksacks, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, responding to a national emergency. 
 They marched into the mountains, with shovels tied to their backs. They cleared rocks the size of houses from blocked roads, with ropes and brute force. They crawled over piles of bricks and concrete, listening for human sounds. 
 ''In order to save people buried under rubble, many soldiers' hands were cut and bloodied, and they kept their hands moving,'' Hu Changming, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said at news conference in May. 
 After the May earthquake in southwestern Sichuan Province, China sent about 130,000 troops from the army, navy, air force and the Second Artillery Corps scrambling into the mountains in China's broadest deployment of its armed forces since it fought a border war with Vietnam in 1979. 
 It was a gritty, hands-on effort, unfolding under the clear view of the public and the news media, and it offered analysts the best chance to assess the performance of the People's Liberation Army in a crisis since the nation's rising economy started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the military. It got good marks for public relations domestically, but the effort left some veteran P.L.A.-watchers underwhelmed. 
 James C. Mulvenon, a specialist on the Chinese military at the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, a government contractor in Washington that performs classified analyses on overseas military programs, said the earthquake showed the army's best and worst sides. It mobilized quickly, but the troops were unprepared to save lives in the first 72 hours, when thousands were buried under toppled masonry and every minute mattered. 
 ''You basically had a bunch of guys humping through the mountains on foot and digging out people with their hands,'' Mr. Mulvenon said. ''It was not a stellar example of a modern military.'' 
 In an online forum hosted by the state-run People's Daily, Zhang Zhaozhong, a prominent defense analyst, said that specialized units like the Marine Corps, the 38th Army Corps of Engineers and the engineering division of the Second Artillery Corps understood how to rescue survivors from beneath collapsed buildings. But he acknowledged that the overwhelming majority of the deployed forces, ordinary combat troops, had little if any rescue training. 
 The army had about 100 helicopters ferrying food, supplies and medical teams into the remote mountain areas and rescuing the injured, said Dennis J. Blasko, a former American Army attache in Beijing. ''The management of aircraft and helicopters operating in the area is probably the largest extended operation of its kind the P.L.A. has ever conducted,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Blasko and other experts said that because the military did not have heavy-lift helicopters, vital equipment like excavators and cranes had to be brought in on roads obstructed by landslides, slowing the pace of the rescue operations.
 Shen Dingli, a leading security expert at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the military's response did not reflect well on the military's preparedness for a potential war with, say, Taiwan, the independently governed island that China claims as its sovereign territory. China's air force deployed 6,500 paratroopers to Sichuan, but only 15 ended up dropping into the disaster zone, military officials said, because of bad weather and forbidding mountain terrain. Mr. Shen called the effort too little and too late.
 ''The air force should have been able to get troops into Wenchuan in two hours,'' he said, referring to a county near the quake's epicenter. ''It took 44 hours. If it took them 10 hours, that's understandable. But 44 hours is shameful.'' 
 Allan Behm, a former official in Australia's Defense Ministry, said the Chinese military was evidently still focused on conventional warfare rather than engineering skills. In spite of its efforts to modernize, Mr. Behm said, ''the P.L.A. is still built on the idea of bringing hundreds of thousands of troops into the battle area.'' 
 China has often deployed the P.L.A., along with a separate paramilitary force, the People's Armed Police, to respond to natural disasters, social unrest and other domestic security issues. Tai Ming Cheung, a senior fellow at the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at the University of California at San Diego, said that in addition to preparing for a possible conflict with Taiwan, China was ''focused on projecting power inside its borders, to ensure social stability.'' 
 In January, P.L.A. units from southwestern China's Chengdu Military Region were deployed to southern areas hit by heavy snowstorms. In March, they were transferred to Tibetan regions of western Sichuan to pacify antigovernment protesters. Then, in May, the earthquake hit, and they came down from the Tibetan plateau to rescue people buried under collapsed buildings. 
 The range of the military's recent missions, and its stated mission to support national construction, national defense and disaster relief, experts say, suggests that the military is still searching for its role. 
 Some Western analysts say that Beijing's willingness to accept aid and rescue teams from several foreign militaries reflects a new openness in a military that has historically operated behind a heavy cloak of secrecy. The military's top commanders held news briefings in Beijing to discuss the work of the troops in the quake's aftermath, and many analysts said they thought it was the military's first such event. 
 Beijing asked the Pentagon's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which operates spy satellites, for high-resolution images of regions affected by the earthquake. China also used 15 of its own satellites to gather information, according to Eric Hagt, director of the China program for the World Security Institute in Washington. It may have asked for satellite images expressly to demonstrate its willingness to work with the international community, Mr. Hagt said.
 It all stands in sharp contrast to the military's performance after the last major earthquake, in Tangshan in 1976, when it refused all foreign aid in an effort to keep the scale of the disaster secret. 
 Chinese and Western analysts agree that the military's lack of heavy-lift helicopters and transport aircraft created the most serious bottleneck in the early days after the May earthquake. Troops had poor communications, they said, and did not have immediate access to surveillance imagery to help them make decisions. 
 ''They were visible everywhere,'' Mr. Hagt said of the soldiers, ''but the actual achievements of the mission were far less admirable. How many more people they could have saved with the proper equipment, technology, know-how and training is hard to know.'' 
 So far, the official death toll is almost 70,000. One Chinese reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, gave an indication of how many more might have been saved. 
 He said he traveled overland with a group of P.L.A. soldiers to the town of Yingxiu, near the earthquake's epicenter. He said that they got there at dusk, about 48 hours after the quake had hit, and that thousands of victims remained buried under collapsed buildings, including more than 200 students at the local elementary school. 
 Eight hundred injured people had been brought to a clearing, waiting to be evacuated by helicopter. But by noon the next day, only about 10 had been evacuated by air, the reporter said. Many died there in the clearing, waiting to be rescued. 
 The town had only one electrical generator, and the troops had no power tools. At the Yingxiu Primary School, the soldiers dug with their hands. Some children could be heard singing under the rubble, the reporter said, presumably to keep their spirits up. 
 A day later, he said, the singing stopped.

HEADLINE: At Moody's, Some Debt Was Rated Incorrectly

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Already under intense scrutiny for its role in the credit crisis, the Moody's Corporation said Tuesday that some employees had violated its code of conduct in rating complex European securities.
 The company said that it would discipline and possibly fire employees who had been involved in rating the debt, which are known as constant proportion debt obligations. Separately, Moody's said it was replacing the executive, Noel Kirnon, who was in charge of its structured finance business at its subsidiary, Moody's Investors Service. It would be the second high-profile executive departure announced by the company in less than two months.
 The news comes as policy makers around the world are looking into how Moody's and its competitors, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, gave high ratings to mortgage and related securities that turned out to be far riskier than their ratings would have implied and have cost the financial system hundreds of billons of dollars. The companies are the subject of several investigations in the United States and Europe. 
 Critics have asserted that Moody's and its peers succumbed to pressures from investment banks that were packaging complex and risky debt during the credit boom earlier this decade. The rating firms are paid mainly by issuers of securities, and receive a relatively small percentage of their revenue from investors.
 The attorney general of Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal, who has been investigating the rating firms, said Moody's admission of incorrect debt obligation ratings was ''just the tip of the iceberg.'' His office is looking at how the firms dealt with investment banks, rated municipal bonds, and handled errors and mistakes.
 ''This company has far-reaching problems well beyond this one incident,'' he said on Tuesday. ''This action fails to address those problems.''
 Shares of Moody's fell 51 cents, to $33.93, down about 45 percent from July 2007. The tight credit market has hit the company hard; its first-quarter earnings were down more than 30 percent from the period a year ago.
 In a statement, Moody's said unidentified employees had violated a code that required analysts to consider only credit factors, not ''the potential impact on Moody's, or an issuer, an investor or other market participant.'' 
 The problems affected 11 constant proportion debt obligations totaling about $1 billion. Instead of being rated triple A at the time that they were issued, the securities should have been rated double A, Moody's said. The firm has removed its ratings on some of those securities and downgraded others to below investment grade, or junk.
 Moody's said an investigation conducted by its law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, had not determined that employees changed the methodology for rating the securities to mask errors in computer models, as was suggested by a report in The Financial Times in May. But it blamed employees in charge of monitoring and adjusting ratings for considering ''factors inappropriate to the rating process'' after the errors were discovered.
 ''The integrity of our rating process is core to Moody's values and is essential to the market,'' Raymond McDaniel, the chairman and chief executive of Moody's said in a written statement. ''If an error occurs, it is crucial that rating committees consider possible rating changes and disclosures in an appropriate manner.''
 Moody's said it was replacing Mr. Kirnon, who will leave July 31, with Andrew E. Kimball, who was until recently the chief credit officer, on a temporary basis until a permanent successor is appointed. The company did not give a reason for the change in executives. Mr. Kirnon did not return a call to his office.
 He will leave Moody's about the same time as another top executive, Brian M. Clarkson. In May, Mr. Clarkson, president and chief operating officer at Moody's Investors Service, said he would retire this month. Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Kirnon both came up through the fast-growing structured finance business, which rates securities backed by mortgages, auto loans and other debts.
 Mr. Kirnon was appointed to head the structured finance business in September just as analysts were beginning to question the high ratings that had been assigned to constant proportion debt obligations by Moody's and S.& P. Before his promotion, Mr. Kirnon was a senior managing director for global derivatives, managed funds and United States commercial real estate.
 One former Moody's analyst who has worked with Mr. Kirnon praised him and said he appeared to be taking the fall for mistakes made by others. ''He was a very thoughtful and very competent analyst,'' said the former analyst, Sylvain Raynes, a financial consultant who has been critical of the ratings firms.
 A spokesman for Moody's, Anthony Mirenda, declined to comment on Mr. Kirnon's departure.
 Last month, Standard & Poor's acknowledged that it had discovered errors in the models it used to rate the debt obligations as well. But the company said the errors had not served to inflate its ratings of the securities.
 Constant proportion debt obligations are a relatively new investment vehicle that sold insurance protection on corporate debt issued in Europe and the United States. Investors in the securities were essentially betting that companies would not default on their bonds and loans. If defaults occurred or the cost of insurance rose, as it did last year, investors in the security would suffer big losses. 
 Relatively few constant proportion debt obligations were issued before credit markets began freezing up last summer. Moody's rated 44 European debt obligations, totaling about $4 billion.

HEADLINE: Paulson Finds Misery in Europe, Too

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
As Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. travels through Europe this week, he wants to reassure jittery audiences that the United States will right its economy and its financial markets.
 But with both sides of the Atlantic now suffering from a similar combination of sagging growth, soaring inflation and shaky banks, Mr. Paulson's visit is turning into a case of misery loving company.
 ''There's no doubt that the second quarter will be a tough quarter,'' Mr. Paulson said in an interview after meeting with the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet. ''There's no doubt in any of our minds that the high oil prices are going to have an impact.'' 
 Europe's economy, which had recently been more resilient than that of the United States, has begun showing signs of an American-style slump. Manufacturing activity in the 15 countries that use the euro shrank in June for the first time in three years, according to an influential survey of purchasing managers released on Tuesday.
 ''I've never been one to accept the decoupling theory,'' Mr. Paulson said, referring to the idea that Europe was immune to a malaise in the United States. ''In a global world, we're all interrelated.''
 A weaker Europe has implications for the United States, Mr. Paulson said, because the United States has benefited from buoyant economic conditions overseas, in particular through exports.
 Now, he said, developing countries would provide the biggest lift to the global economy. Mr. Paulson said that Russia, which he visited on Monday, and other nations with similar economic prospects were still growing robustly, though they, too, were grappling with rising fuel and food prices.
 Fears of an inflationary spiral have prompted the European Central Bank to signal that it will raise interest rates this week. Mr. Trichet, the central bank's president, has come under intense pressure from European leaders not to tighten credit at a time of weakening economic growth. But that is not expected to deter the bank.
 A higher interest rate is likely to drive up the euro against the dollar because, with the Federal Reserve so far resisting an increase, it would widen the disparity in borrowing costs between Europe, where the central bank now has a benchmark rate at 4 percent, and the United States, where the Fed's base rate is 2 percent.
 Mr. Paulson reaffirmed the importance of a strong dollar on his trip, which will end Thursday in London.
 But he declined to comment on the divergence between the Fed and the European Central Bank, saying he liked independent central banks. ''Whether it is Ben Bernanke or Jean-Claude Trichet, I relish that,'' he said. 
 By contrast, President Nicolas Sarkozy used France's new status as the rotating president of the European Union to deliver a fresh warning to the bank not to imperil Europe's growth with a rate increase.
 ''The E.C.B. must ask itself about economic growth in Europe and not just about inflation,'' Mr. Sarkozy said on the France 3 television network on Monday evening. ''You can double, triple interest rates and that will not bring a decrease in the price of a barrel of Brent,'' he said, referring to crude oil.
 Even more significantly, the German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, reiterated concerns of a rate increase. Unlike Mr. Sarkozy, who is a regular critic of the central bank, German officials are normally scrupulous about not meddling in monetary policy.
 ''The E.C.B. should consider which effects an interest rate rise would have on economic growth,'' Mr. Steinbruck said Tuesday at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, according to Reuters.
 The European Central Bank has been resolute in the face of such pressure, and economists expect it to lift rates to 4.25 percent on Thursday, when its governing board is scheduled to meet. The question, given the record-setting pace of inflation, is whether it will stop there, or embark on a series of increases.
 Inflation is already running at 4 percent, double the 2 percent threshold set by the bank. With oil prices continuing to rise, some economists expect it to peak at 4.2 percent in August.
 ''If corporations are squeezed between rising oil prices and higher borrowing costs, that would be devastating,'' said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Bank of America in London. ''This horror scenario, which I wouldn't have believed a month ago, now seems more likely.''
 The latest economic data paints a picture of gloom across much of the Continent, with manufacturing activity contracting in France, Italy and Austria. The contraction is particularly acute in Spain and Ireland, where a collapse in housing has aggravated the general malaise.
 But Germany, Europe's largest economy, reported a modest expansion in activity, as well as a rebound in retail sales and a further drop in unemployment. At 7.8 percent, the jobless rate is the lowest since August 1992.
 Mr. Paulson singled out these divergences as an issue for Europe's politicians and central bankers.
 ''The challenge they have is that Europe is not a homogeneous group of places,'' he said. ''In Germany, although the mood has turned down a bit, you've got a much stronger situation than in Spain or Ireland.''
 German banks, Mr. Paulson noted, were facing some of the same fallout from the credit crisis as those in the United States. He said he had discussed financial market regulation with Mr. Trichet as well as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whom he met earlier on Tuesday in Berlin. 
 Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Paris.

HEADLINE: Plea for Aid To Avert Starvation

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Warning that rising food and oil prices pose a crisis for the world's poor, Robert B. Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, is calling on President Bush and other leaders convening in Japan next week in an economic summit meeting to make new aid commitments to avert starvation and instability in dozens of countries.
 ''What we are witnessing is not a natural disaster -- a silent tsunami or a perfect storm,'' Mr. Zoellick said in a letter sent Tuesday evening to the major leaders of the West. ''It is a man-made catastrophe, and as such must be fixed by people.'' 
 Mr. Zoellick's letter, obtained by The New York Times, came with a lengthy study of the impact of rising prices for food, fuel and commodities on the world's poor. He sent the letter as Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda prepares to host Mr. Bush and six other world leaders in the Group of 8 economic summit meeting on the northern island of Hokkaido.
 In recent weeks, the United States and some other countries have stepped up their pledges to get food to the poor in the 50 hardest-hit countries. But Mr. Zoellick said in his letter that the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Food Program had short-term needs of $10 billion.
 Bank officials said that the world faced a shortfall in aid, but that pledges of financing had not been channeled into a central place and the size of the shortfall was not clear. ''This is a test of the global system to help the most vulnerable, and it cannot afford to fail,'' Mr. Zoellick said.
 Separately, the International Monetary Fund released a report on Tuesday describing dire effects on the people and economies of developing countries if food and fuel prices stay high. 
 The analysis shows ''that some countries really are at a tipping point -- if food prices rise further and oil prices stay the same, some governments will no longer be able to feed their people and at the same time maintain stability in their economies,'' said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the fund.
 Seven countries have already responded to high prices by borrowing at deep discounts from a special I.M.F. program for countries with very low income. 
 Burkina Faso reached a loan agreement in January; Mali and Niger in Africa and Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia obtained loans in late May; and Benin, the Central African Republic and Haiti did so last month.
 Mr. Zoellick's letter calculates that, for the world's 41 poorest countries, the combined impact of high food, fuel and other commodities is a ''negative shock'' to their economies, reducing gross domestic product by between 3 and 10 percent, causing ''broken lives and stunted potential'' for millions.
 The letter says the trust funds and aid funds set up by the world's richest countries are on the verge of running out of grant money to finance school feeding, mother and child nutrition programs and food-for-work programs.
 Mr. Zoellick, a former deputy secretary of state and top trade envoy in the Bush administration, has been in office for a year, having succeeded Paul D. Wolfowitz, who was ousted over allegations of favoritism. 
 One of the stamps of Mr. Zoellick's time in office has been a willingness to challenge donor countries, including the United States.
 He called for three immediate steps to be discussed at the summit meeting. They include supplying sufficient money for a ''rapid financing facility'' for those needing food aid, and establishing a program to get seed and fertilizers to small farmers, especially in Africa.
 Mr. Zoellick is also calling on more than two dozen countries to ease export bans on food, which he said have contributed to higher prices. The export bans make it harder to move food around the world over long distances. 
 Over the longer term, Mr. Zoellick is calling for the United States and countries in Europe and elsewhere to end their subsidies of and tariffs on fuels made from corn and other foodstuffs. The bank, in a report this spring, said that conversion of food into energy had contributed to the global spike in food prices.
 The World Bank is also increasing its own financial support for food and agriculture research, to make countries more productive in meeting their own food needs, Mr. Zoellick said.
 In May, President Bush announced that the United States would spend nearly $5 billion this year and next ''to fight global hunger,'' and White House officials say that in Japan the president will call on other countries to meet their past commitments as well as make new ones.

HEADLINE: State Aims to Help Families Struggling to Buy Food

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
As New York's poorest residents struggle to make ends meet amid sharply rising food prices, the administration of Gov. David A. Paterson has found a way to significantly increase federal food assistance -- by more than 50 percent in some cases -- for about 114,000 impoverished households around the state, officials said Tuesday.
 In a plan the governor was expected to formally announce on Wednesday, about 90,000 households in New York City will be eligible to receive, on average, $131 more per month in food stamps, the federal food assistance program, state officials said. About 24,000 households elsewhere in the state will be eligible to receive, on average, $72 more per month in food stamps. 
 The increases will be a windfall for many poor families. The average household food stamp allocation in New York is $214 per month, according to the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, the agency charged with oversight of support programs and economic assistance for low-income New Yorkers. 
 ''Rising food and commodities prices are affecting all New Yorkers,'' Governor Paterson said in a written statement on Tuesday. ''Increasing food stamp benefits for some of our state's most vulnerable residents will truly make a difference in their lives and help them to better meet their families' nutritional needs.'' 
 The increases are allowable under provisions in federal law that enable residents enrolled in the federal home-energy subsidy program to receive higher food stamp allocations. To benefit from the increases, 114,000 households, most of whom are in New York City public and Section 8 subsidized housing, will be enrolled in the energy subsidy program.
 The strategy is part of the state's energy assistance plan, which is currently undergoing public comment and must be submitted to the federal Department of Health and Human Services by Sept. 1. State officials said they planned to begin the increase in food stamps on Oct. 1.
 While participation in the energy subsidy program will be nominal -- each household will receive an annual subsidy of only $1 -- the effect of the enrollment will be to make the households eligible for the food stamp increases, state officials said. 
 The provisions have existed for years, but this apparently will be the first time that the state has taken advantage of them to help residents in public and Section 8 housing, who have historically been deemed ineligible because most do not pay for energy costs for their homes. 
 David A. Hansell, commissioner of the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, said in an interview on Tuesday that he did not know why earlier administrations had not taken advantage of the provisions. 
 But he said that a recent change in state law that increased public housing subsidies for about 40,000 households while decreasing food stamp benefits had spurred the Paterson administration to look for creative ways to increase food stamp allocations. 
 Phyllis Morris, director of the state's energy assistance program for low-income households, said officials in the Paterson administration ''just recently learned'' that several other states, including Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine and Washington, had made similar changes that increased food stamp allocations for poor residents. 
 ''It was really kind of a learning process,'' she said. ''We discovered that it was happening and was being implemented successfully.'' 
 Of the 114,000 new households to be enrolled in the energy assistance program, about 102,000 are in public and Section 8 subsidized housing, and the rest are in group homes and congregate living residences, said Michael Hayes, spokesman for the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance.

HEADLINE: It's Time to Rebuild Our Nation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Anxious in America,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, June 29):
 In his excellent column, Mr. Friedman calls for nation-building here in the United States to deal with our intractable problems at home and abroad.
 For decades, I and other political scientists have called for rebuilding our horse-and-buggy 18th-century constitutional system, with its divided powers and inevitable gridlock. We have warned that the system survives mainly by putting more power into the hands of the president -- a dangerous fall-back when we are governed by an inept president. 
 Proposals for reform range from institutional changes such as abolition of the Electoral College to fundamental transformations such as democratizing our political parties and synchronizing terms of office for House, Senate and president.
 I hope that Mr. Friedman will spell out his own strategies for comprehensive nation-building in future columns.
 James MacGregor Burns
 Williamstown, Mass., June 29, 2008
 The writer is emeritus professor of government at Williams College and a past president of the American Political Science Association.
 To the Editor:
 For almost 28 years now our political system has failed to do anything substantive to deal with our energy crisis. By political system or government I mean the Democratic and Republican Parties, which are our government and political system. 
 Slowly, both parties have melded into one party of inertia that cannot deal successfully with the problems of the 21st century whether they be energy, foreign relations or the economy. By playing good cop, bad cop, the Democrats and Republicans constantly blame each other for what is wrong. 
 While playing the blame game, Democrats and Republicans take money from lobbyists representing powerful industries and corporate interests as they bulk up their coffers for the next election. If our forefathers were alive today, they would shun both parties for being selfish and self-centered rather than representing the interests of the American people and moving our country forward by solving problems instead of adding to them. 
 Rather than saying government, Congress or the executive branch, it is time to call these entities what they really are: Republicans and Democrats. It is the two political parties that are failing an ailing America.
 Bradley Ian Berger
 Manalapan, N.J., June 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman cites the credit crisis, unhappy S.U.V. owners, and auto company stockholders as important constituencies to support his position that nation-building in America is the key issue in our election. If middle-class and wealthier individuals and families are anxious, let me suggest that there are up to 24 million poor Americans who are desperate and even more in need of the kind of domestic nation-building Mr. Friedman calls for.
 During the last two months, I've met with low-income people in Alaska who are paying $8 for a gallon of gas; food bank and food pantry staff in California and North Carolina who cannot keep pace with the increased and more frequent demands for food; residents in Massachusetts and Idaho who are already worried about having enough home heat this winter; and Head Start and child care workers in Florida and Kentucky whose centers have long waiting lists. 
 Our next president and Congress need to support the kinds of tried and tested solutions that will enable poor Americans to gain better economic security. Unless we as a nation invest in and provide realistic opportunities for those of us in need, no victories or successes will make us a safe and prosperous nation. 
 Don Mathis
 President and Chief Executive
 Community Action Partnership
 Washington, June 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman is spot on. We use to try harder and do better. 
 He cites the response to Sputnik and the 1973 oil crisis. 
 There were certainly other times we came together that stand out: Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s and Dwight D. Eisenhower's promotion of the Interstate highway system got people working, with the additional benefit of adding to the national infrastructure.
 With gas in California at $5 a gallon, we may have hit the tipping point that will get America and Americans pulling together to find alternate forms of energy and end our dependence not only on foreign oil but also on oil in general. More drilling is not the answer; it is only postponing the inevitable. 
 John Goodman
 Oak Park, Calif., June 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman perfectly captured the great sadness that so many of us feel about the downward slide of our country from optimism, amazing progress and world leadership into mediocrity, the paralysis of fear, floundering foreign policies and astounding policy changes like acceptance of torture and loss of habeas corpus. 
 He laid it out without the hysteria and name-calling that we have often resorted to in our sadness and frustration.
 I just hope that a great majority have noticed how desperately our country needs to be rebuilt. Debby Howell

HEADLINE: Organized by Women, to Market to Women

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE largest advertising holding company is starting a consultancy devoted to the largest consumer group.
 The Omnicom Group in New York, which owns agencies like BBDO, DDB, Ketchum, OMD and TBWA, is forming the consultancy to help marketers reach women. The new unit is named G23 -- G as in Group, 23 as in the pair of chromosomes that carries the sex differences between women and men.
 G23 is being opened by senior leaders at Omnicom agencies, all of them women. They will work for G23 while continuing in their agency posts in fields like public relations, cultural anthropology, corporate identity, media services, behavioral planning and digital marketing.
 The G23 partners will be advised by a board that is also all female. The members include Susan Smith Ellis, a former Omnicom executive who is now chief executive at Red, the company that helps raise money to fight AIDS in Africa; Linda Scott, editor of Advertising and Society Review; and Fara Warner, a journalist who wrote the book ''The Power of the Purse: How Smart Businesses Adapt to Women Consumers.'' 
 Agencies and agency companies are increasing their efforts to help clients aim pitches at women. The work is parallel to efforts to improve life inside agencies for women and appoint more women to executive jobs.
 The power of women in the marketplace is undisputed. Surveys indicate that female consumers in the United States buy or influence the buying of more than 75 percent of all goods.
 But ad makers have long struggled to find the right ways to approach women, as evidenced by a remark made decades ago by an industry leader, David Ogilvy: ''The consumer is not an idiot. She is your wife.''
 (Implicit in that remark, of course, is the idea that everyone being dressed down by Mr. Ogilvy was a man -- and that all the men would be married. Sometimes, it seems the TV series ''Mad Men'' is a documentary rather than a drama.)
 ''Targeting women is something that is at the core'' of the industry, said John D. Wren, president and chief executive at Omnicom, but at the same time ''the need has always existed to do it in a fashion that adds value.''
 ''Something different but meaningful was always the challenge,'' he added. ''Like most things, it required the right leadership.''
 Enter Janet Riccio, an executive vice president at Omnicom who ''took it on herself to formulate the idea and gather the people'' for G23, Mr. Wren said.
 ''I'm the cheerleader in this,'' he added, laughing, in a remark that played a bit with gender stereotypes.
 Ms. Riccio, who reports to Mr. Wren, said in a separate interview that G23 was intended to be a consultancy to provide clients ''assets across all our brands, representative of all the disciplines our company offers.''
 G23 will also develop on its own information of value to advertisers about women, Ms. Riccio said. One example is a study, conducted for G23 by the research companies Harris Interactive and Pacific Ethnography, that examines the economic behavior of women in 16 countries. The study, which cost more than $1 million, groups the women into eight ''tribes'' and compares them to other women rather than men.
 G23 joins a lengthening list of projects centered on women, some of which are more than a decade old. Examples include Just Ask a Woman, led by Mary Lou Quinlan, former chief executive at N. W. Ayer; LeoShe, a consulting practice within Leo Burnett Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, which works for clients like Procter & Gamble; and Womenkind, whose four founders include two men.
 ''I don't think marketers truly recognize the influence women have in categories like automobiles, health care and home improvement,'' said Ruthie Winig, senior vice president and account director at Frank About Women, based in the Winston-Salem, N.C., office of Mullen, an agency that is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 ''And with women representing a growing proportion of undergraduates and graduates'' at colleges and universities, she added, ''not only are women a primary target for your advertising, but they could be running your company one day.''
 Ms. Winig, whose clients include Abbott Laboratories, Bissell, T. J. Maxx and Ryka footwear, said her agency was ''immersed in the beliefs and behaviors of women,'' but not to the exclusion of the other sex.
 ''If you can capture the heart and attention of a women,'' she said, ''you can win with a man.''
 That thought was echoed by Millie Olson, chief executive at Amazon Advertising in San Francisco, which she founded with Lynda Pearson in 1996.
 ''To focus on this market hasn't limited us,'' said Ms. Olson, whose clients include Mondavi wines and the Kashi division of Kellogg, because ''to advertise to women is to advertise in mixed company.''
 ''It's clear nobody completely gets it,'' Ms. Olson said of marketing to women, ''at least, not all the time.''
 ''A lot of iterations out there are, 'Make it pink,' '' she added. ''The whole thing cracks me up.''
 Less of a laughing matter is the track record of Madison Avenue when it comes to opportunities for women.
 ''We have to look at increasing the number of women in leadership roles,'' said Heide Gardner, senior vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer at Interpublic in New York, because data show that ''women are substantially underrepresented in the highest levels of the advertising industry.''
 At the same time, she added, the industry must do better in recruiting for entry-level jobs because there can be no promotions to senior posts without women inside the agencies to climb the corporate ladders.
 ''We have to look at the talent market like marketers,'' Ms. Gardner said, ''because we're competing for the people graduating in advertising- and marketing-related fields.''
 Mr. Wren of Omnicom said he agreed that improving the outlook for women in the industry was ''a real and constant challenge,'' particularly when far more women in influential positions could now be found in clients' executive suites.
 But the opening of G23 is ''not intended to necessarily resolve that issue,'' he added.
 The other six core founding partners at G23, in addition to Ms. Riccio, are Julie Bauer, president at BauerWorks, which specializes in eliciting consumer insights about products; Emma Gilding, president at In:site, a consultancy for cultural anthropology, who came up with the name G23; Tracy Lovatt, executive vice president and behavioral planning director at BBDO North America, part of the BBDO Worldwide advertising agency; Sharon Love, chief executive at TPN, which specializes in consumer marketing and communications; Andrea Sullivan, executive director for client services at Interbrand, the corporate and brand identity agency; and Julie Winskie, president and chief client officer at the Porter Novelli public relations agency.
 Ms. Riccio said the partners were starting to make presentations to potential clients and had scheduled meetings for this week. 
 Meetings during the week of the Fourth of July, when most of the pooh-bahs of advertising are on their way to Somehampton or another? Maybe Ladies' Home Journal has been right all these years about never underestimating the power of a you-know-who.

HEADLINE: Snow in July Is a Mixed Blessing for the Northern Rockies

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: ST. MARY, Mont. 

 BODY:
With diesel smoke and white powder flying, heavy equipment operators worked furiously to remove enough snow to open the Going-to-the-Sun road, which connects the two sides of Glacier National Park and is usually open by the first week of June.
 But huge amounts of snow still blanket the Northern Rockies high country, in part because of record snowfalls in Montana this year, so the opening will not take place until Wednesday, the latest on record by a day, except for World War II when the road was not plowed at all. 
 The delayed opening has been a blow to this town, at the east entrance to the park, and to West Glacier, the opposite gateway. Both depend on gasoline sales, restaurant checks and other income from tourists who drive Going-to-the-Sun, the 52-mile scenic road that winds through the heart of these glacier-etched mountains. 
 ''A day's worth of work for us is a million dollars worth of commerce for the gateway communities,'' said Jim Foster, deputy facilities manager at the park, as a bighorn sheep scampered across the road. ''We're aware of that.''
 But what is tough news for the workers and business owners is a relief to other parts of the Northern Rockies, a region that has suffered through record high temperatures and a withering drought the last eight years, as well as low snowpack, low stream flows and large forest fires that clouded the sky with smoke.
 ''Snow in the mountains is money in the bank,'' Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana said. ''The snow will melt and run into the streams through September. It's good for the fisheries and good for irrigation.''
 Mr. Schweitzer cited more good news from the state climatologist, who, he said, has forecast a cooler and wetter July than normal. Still, the governor said, even though things are better, ''no matter what the weather is, we're never more than two weeks from a drought.''
 For now, residents feel they have some breathing room. ''We got so much moisture in June, it released a pressure valve,'' said Lisa Bay, a rancher near Wolf Creek, Mont. ''It was a grand sense of relief.''
 The situation is similar in Wyoming. Snowpack in the Bighorn Mountains, in the north central part of the state, is 79 percent higher than the 30-year average, and 112 percent above the average in the area drained by the Powder and Tongue Rivers.
 ''Everything is up from average,'' said Leanne Stevenson, manager of natural resources and policy for the Wyoming Department of Agriculture. ''A lot of what makes a difference is not how much, but how long it stays cool, and we actually had spring this year.'' 
 Because of the drought, she said, the 30-year snowpack average has dropped 20 percent over the last eight years.
 The heavy snows and elevated water levels have thrown an economy dependent on recreation into confusion.
 In Glacier National Park, some high-country hiking trails will not be open for weeks.
 In Yellowstone National Park, some backcountry areas are blocked by snow and some rivers are high and muddy. ''Our ongoing challenge is backcountry access,'' Al Nash, a park spokesman, said. ''We have high flowing water, mud and, in shady areas, snow. It just isn't accessible right now. It could easily be another month before we have access.''
 But the snows will help the park recover from a drought that has caused ponds and wetlands to dry up, killed fish, reduced vegetation and even lengthened the period between eruptions of the famous geysers.
 ''One good year doesn't overcome a drought,'' Mr. Nash said. ''But it's sure welcome and helpful.'' 
 Rivers that in the last eight years usually retreated to their normal levels in May or early June are still running up to their banks. Many people who came to the Northern Rockies to fly fish in June found their favorite rivers the color of chocolate milk. 
 ''We were fishing most all the rivers in the past at this time, but this year that's not the case,'' said Dan Lohmiller, an owner of the River's Edge fly-fishing shop in Bozeman, Mont. Just 3 of 15 rivers are fishable now, he said, and the rest are not expected to be open until at least mid-July, prompting some people to cancel fishing trips. 
 On the Yellowstone River near Livingston, Mont., record high flows forced local officials to close a bridge that appeared to be collapsing because of high waters, stranding 24 people on an island for a few days until a temporary one was installed. Farmers and ranchers, though, are happy. ''We were way behind in moisture, and we caught up and got an extra five or six inches'' of rain in June, said Mr. Schweitzer, a farmer and a soil scientist. ''Every extra inch of rain above average means seven more bushels per acre, and we got six inches,'' he said. ''We'll get 40 more bushels per acre this year. That makes it a billion-dollar storm.'' 
 While farmers will be earning more, the Park Service here is stretched financially because of rising overtime and fuel costs. 
 Crews have been working on the Big Drift near the top of Going-to-the-Sun Road. At 70 feet deep, the drift was the plowers' biggest obstacle. It was also next to a cliff, making snow even more challenging to remove. A storm in mid-June -- the one that brought rain to lower elevations, helping wheat farmers -- dumped three to four feet of snow in the mountains here. Avalanches, which carried snow, trees, rocks and other debris, closed sections of the road that had been plowed. One section, known as Triple Arches, had to be plowed five times because of avalanches. 
 So much snow still remains that the Park Service had to move the 75th anniversary celebration of the highway, held last Friday, off the pass to lower elevations.
 ''The sense of impending doom is gone,'' said Ms. Bay, the rancher. ''But there are long-term changes, such as springs drying up, and that shows we have a ways to go.''

HEADLINE: Improve Human Rights, McCain Tells Colombian

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and SIMON ROMERO; Elisabeth Bumiller reported from Cartagena, and Simon Romero from Caracas, Venezuela.

DATELINE: CARTAGENA, Colombia 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain pressed President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia to do more to improve human rights in a meeting on Tuesday evening here. Earlier in the day, he criticized his Democratic competitor, Senator Barack Obama, for opposing a trade agreement between the United States and Colombia.
 Cartagena, a Colombian seaport of nightclubs, cobblestone streets and 300-year-old Spanish colonial mansions, is a curious stop for an American presidential candidate. But in a 20-hour visit, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, is seeking to use the city as a photogenic backdrop to score political points against Mr. Obama and to promote his foreign policy and national security credentials. 
 ''I hope that we could move forward with a free trade agreement between our two countries,'' Mr. McCain said at a news conference in the humid, mosquito-filled night air outside Casa de Huespedes, the Colombian presidential retreat, with Mr. Uribe at his side. 
 A short time later, in response to a question on Colombia's record on human rights, Mr. McCain said that he had discussed the issue with Mr. Uribe in a meeting on various topics that lasted an hour and 40 minutes. ''I believe that progress is being made,'' Mr. McCain said, ''and I believe that more progress needs to be made.''
 Mr. McCain had promised before the trip that he would not publicly criticize Mr. Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, on foreign soil, saying political partisanship ended at the water's edge. But his pledge did not include a session with reporters on his campaign plane en route to Colombia, he called Mr. Obama ''a protectionist'' and cast him as ignorant about economic forces in the United States.
 ''We just have a difference of opinion,'' Mr. McCain said, ''and I'm a student of history.'' He added: ''An overwhelming majority of historians will tell you that protectionism and isolationism were a major factor in one of the greatest depressions in the modern history of this country. I'm not going to sit by and see that happen.''
 Mr. McCain also stepped up his criticism of Mr. Obama over remarks made on Monday by Wesley K. Clark, the retired general and Obama military adviser, who said he did not think that Mr. McCain's experience being shot down as a naval aviator in Vietnam was ''a qualification to be president.'' General Clark stood by his remarks on Tuesday.
 Mr. McCain responded, ''I think it's up to Senator Obama now to not only repudiate him, but to cut him loose.''
 The trade deal, which would lift tariffs on the majority of goods traded between the United States and Colombia, has recently moved from the political sidelines to the center of the presidential campaign. Mr. McCain supports the deal as essential to free trade and relations with a crucial ally that receives about $600 million a year in counterinsurgency and anti-narcotics aid, but Mr. Obama and many Democrats oppose it because of workers' fears about job losses overseas and American labor's concern over the killings of union leaders in Colombia.
 The trade deal was signed in 2006, but requires authorization by Congress. In April, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, set off an angry partisan confrontation when she announced that she would block a vote on it.
 Even before Mr. McCain left for Colombia, John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., issued a statement calling the trip ''yet one more example of how out of touch he is with working families, and how close he is to corporate special interests.'' 
 Mr. Sweeney added, ''hundreds of trade unionists have been systematically murdered, tortured, kidnapped and threatened by paramilitary organizations during the tenure of President Alvaro Uribe, yet Senator McCain will tout the supposed benefits of the proposed U.S.-Colombia F.T.A in the resort city of Cartagena.''
 Mr. McCain, with Mr. Uribe standing by, acknowledged that there were still significant problems on several fronts in Colombia, which is beset by left-wing guerillas, right-wing paramilitary death squads and a large drug trafficking industry. (The Drug Enforcement Agency estimates that up to 90 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States comes from Colombia, and coca cultivation is surging, despite longstanding American efforts to help Colombia destroy the crops.) But Mr. McCain said that Mr. Uribe had made significant gains.
 ''I thank you for the success you have achieved at great sacrifice in trying to eliminate drugs,'' Mr. McCain said, adding that the strategy to eradicate drugs was working because ''the cost of an ounce of cocaine in the street in the United States has significantly increased.''
 Mr. Uribe answered no questions at the news conference, but in remarks introducing and praising Mr. McCain, he said that ''we also consider the recent comments by Senator Obama regarding Colombia to be positive.'' It was unclear on Tuesday night exactly what remarks Mr. Uribe was referring to, though it may have been Mr. Obama's description of Marxist-inspired Colombian rebels as terrorists.
 Mr. Uribe treated Mr. McCain and his traveling party -- Mr. McCain's wife, Cindy, as well as Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut -- to near-presidential treatment. After the news conference, the group had dinner with Mr. Uribe and then was to stay overnight at the seaside presidential retreat.
 Mr. McCain had no comment on Mr. Uribe's call last week for a rerun of his 2006 election, the result of a clash between Mr. Uribe and the Colombia Supreme Court. ''I can't take sides in that kind of an issue -- that's a domestic issue,'' Mr. McCain told reporters on his plane.

HEADLINE: Car Sales at a 10-Year Low

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Sales of new cars and trucks plunged to their lowest level in more than a decade in June, as high gas prices and a weak economy kept American consumers away from dealer showrooms.
With the drop last month of more than 18 percent, automakers now expect to sell well below 15 million new vehicles this year, far fewer than the norm this decade of more than 16 million vehicles a year.
Detroit automakers were hit hard. Ford Motor was down 28 percent in June, General Motors was off 18 percent, and Chrysler dropped 36 percent.
Despite its sharp decline, G.M's results were better than expected, which industry analysts attributed to a sales blitz with offers of zero-interest, long-term financing deals. The cut-rate loans helped G.M. retain its historic position as the top-selling United States automaker over Toyota, whose sales fell 21 percent. 
While sales had been steadily declining since the spring, the June totals, announced Tuesday, marked a low point in what is shaping up as an abysmal year in the car business. The sales last month were further depressed because there were three fewer days when dealerships were open compared with a year ago.
''We're looking at an industry sales rate that is the lowest in over a decade, probably in 15 years,'' said George Pipas, Ford's chief market analyst.
Prospects for a turnaround through the rest of the summer are dimming for reasons beyond the soft economy and $4-a-gallon gas.
Even with some factories running at peak capacity, auto companies cannot meet the surging demand for small, fuel-efficient cars. At the same time, manufacturers are slashing production of slow-selling pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
''We're talking a few months at least before automakers can better match supply with demand,'' said Jesse Toprak, executive director of industry analysis for Edmunds.com, an automotive research Web site.
The drastically lower sales have raised concerns about the financial health of the Detroit automakers, which have relied heavily on sales of pickup and sport utility vehicles for profits in recent years.
Shares in G.M. sank to their lowest level in more than 50 years last week, though they rebounded 2 percent Tuesday. Many investors are questioning whether the poor sales will force a cash crisis at the company.
Officials at G.M., Ford and Chrysler have vigorously denied that they will run out of operating cash in the near future.
''Even in a worst-case scenario, we have enough cash and credit lines to last well through the end of 2009,'' said a G.M. spokesman, Tony Cervone.
A Ford spokesman, Mark Truby, said the company is well-financed and nowhere close to a financial disaster, like a bankruptcy filing. ''With our liquidity, that's not a concern,'' he said.
Still, industry observers believe the two automakers, as well as their smaller rival Chrysler, may need to raise additional capital to weather the sales downturn.
''The health of the business is based on cash flow, and when the cash goes you are in deep trouble,'' said David Cole, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
If sales continue to slump, the Detroit companies may be forced to cut more jobs, sell assets, or try to raise more capital by borrowing.
The goal, Mr. Cole said, will be to remain financially solvent until the market rebounds and savings from a new labor contract are realized in 2010.
''There is a tremendous sense of urgency simply to get through this period of turbulence,'' he said.
The seismic shift by consumers to small cars from large vehicles has blindsided virtually every automaker. Only Honda Motor, where sales rose 1 percent in June, appears to have been prepared. The Japanese automaker's Fit subcompact nearly doubled its sales during the month, and its Civic sedan set a June record.
By contrast, Toyota executives said they could not meet demand for its Prius hybrid-electric car or its small, fuel-efficient Corolla and Yaris models.
The consumer shift toward smaller vehicles reflects their broad concerns about gas prices and the overall economy, said James Lentz, Toyota's top sales executive in the United States.
''There are so many things weighing on the consumer's mind today,'' Mr. Lentz said. ''It has driven consumer confidence down to a low we haven't seen since the oil embargo in 1973.''
The decline in housing construction has crippled sales of pickup trucks, too. Sales of Ford's F-Series pickup plummeted 40 percent in June, and G.M. reported a 24 percent drop for its Chevrolet Silverado model.
Auto executives had little choice but to take a philosophical view of the market. ''This too shall pass,'' said Steven J. Landry, head of North American sales for Chrysler. ''When it does, we want to be prepared.''
The Detroit automakers are temporarily laying off thousands of hourly workers as they idle plants making pickups and S.U.V.'s. Both Ford and G.M. are planning to add shifts to factories making small cars, but their additional production will not be available until the fall.
Japanese manufacturers have more flexible plants that will allow them to increase their output of small cars sooner, Mr. Toprak said.
The critical issue for Detroit is whether the companies have sufficient cash to weather the downturn.
Analysts project that G.M. will consume more than $1 billion in cash reserves each month to keep developing new products in the face of declining revenue.
But the automaker is confident that its reserves will hold out, Mr. Cervone said. ''We have about $24 billion in cash and another $7 billion in credit lines we haven't tapped yet,'' he added.
G.M will continue to evaluate ways to cut costs, he said. G.M. recently postponed the redesign of its next generation of pickup trucks, and announced plans to possibly sell its Hummer brand.
Mr. Cole said that G.M. might consider splitting the company into two parts -- a North American operation and an international unit -- and raise money with a public stock offering for the growing overseas business.
Ford has already borrowed heavily against its assets to raise $29 billion in cash. Even so, the second largest of Detroit's car companies is in the midst of cutting white-collar jobs and planning more buyouts of factory workers.
Privately held Chrysler, which was bought last year by Cerberus Capital Management, said last week that it was financially healthy and not considering bankruptcy protection.
Chrysler drastically cut its production plans early in the year, but this week was forced to announce the closing of one of its minivan factories and the elimination of a shift of workers at a pickup plant. One of its senior executives said Tuesday that the downsizing has stabilized Chrysler's financial position.
''We committed to restructuring the company to being a much better but smaller organization,'' said James E. Press, a Chrysler vice chairman.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is in No Shape to Give Advice, Medvedev Says

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Russia's new president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, less swaggering than his predecessor but as touchy about criticism from abroad, said in an interview that an America in ''essentially a depression'' was in no position to lecture other countries on how to conduct their affairs. 
 With soaring oil revenues bolstering the Russian economy and Kremlin confidence, Mr. Medvedev brushed aside American criticism of his country's record on democracy and human rights. He also said that a revived Russia had a right to assume a larger role in a world economic system that he suggested should no longer be dominated by the United States. 
 Mr. Medvedev made his comments on Tuesday in a meeting with a small group of foreign journalists a day after the American treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., appealed in Moscow for Russian investment in the United States. The symbolism of the visit resonated here, in that only a decade had passed since the Russian economy was in shambles and the country was desperate for Western aid.
 Mr. Medvedev seemed to be seeking in the interview to raise his profile before attending the Group of 8 meeting of industrialized nations next week in Japan. Mr. Medvedev leads Russia in tandem with his predecessor and mentor, Vladimir V. Putin, who is now prime minister and is still widely considered Russia's pre-eminent leader.
 In the interview, Mr. Medvedev was asked about a call by Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to bar Russia from the Group of 8 because of its record on democracy. Mr. Medvedev, who easily won Russia's presidential election in March after the Kremlin hobbled the opposition, responded that the question of democracy was irrelevant to the Group of 8 and, besides, the United States had more pressing matters to attend to. 
 ''The Group of 8 exists not because someone likes or dislikes it, but because objectively, they are the biggest world economies and the most serious players from the foreign policy point of view,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''Any attempts to put restrictions on anyone in this capacity will damage the entire world order.''
 He added, ''I am sure that any administration of the United States of America, if it wishes to succeed, among other things, in overcoming essentially a depression that exists in the American economic market, must conduct a pragmatic policy inside the country and abroad.''
 Mr. Medvedev said world leaders should realize that the credit crunch and a gathering global recession signaled that the worldwide economic architecture needed to be overhauled. He did not specify how this should be done, but indicated it should entail a reduction in the influence of the United States.
 ''It has to be improved, it has to be more up-to-date, better protected from risks, and it must not suffer from national egoism, financial and economic egoism, but must be more fair toward other countries; this is absolutely evident,'' he said. ''This system cannot be oriented toward only one country and only one currency.''
 A former law professor who has spent much of his career as a behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, Mr. Medvedev showed a wide-ranging knowledge of foreign and domestic issues, confidently answering questions for 90 minutes without notes and speaking at length without stumbling. The president, who is 42, spoke only in Russian but did not need an interpreter to understand questions posed in English.
 Mr. Medvedev provided no glimpses of disagreements with Mr. Putin on policies or strategy, though their stylistic differences were readily apparent. Whereas Mr. Putin occasionally responds to questions with blunt retorts or salty language, Mr. Medvedev tends to offer demurrals and then to engage in a kind of academic discussion of issues.
 As he has many times in recent weeks, Mr. Medvedev championed his proposals to reduce corruption, which he acknowledges is endemic in Russia. He was then asked whether he believed that corruption could be beaten back, considering that the country's political system is dominated by a single party, Mr. Putin's United Russia.
 ''A system that was built on the idea that one party holds all the truths demonstrated its weakness 20 years ago,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''It failed to cope with new challenges and ceased to exist. That's why, to ensure the competitive ability of our country on a global scale, we must make use of political competition, among other things. But it must be sensible. This is to say, competition, correctly built.''
 Mr. Medvedev indicated that he would not get involved in the case of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former oil oligarch and Putin opponent convicted of financial crimes and sent to a Siberian prison. The authorities have recently brought new charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky, while his lawyers have mounted a campaign for his release.
 Some political analysts have described Mr. Medvedev as more liberal than Mr. Putin and others in the Kremlin, in part because Mr. Medvedev did not serve in the security services. (Mr. Putin is a former K.G.B. agent who was head of its successor agency, the F.S.B.)
 Mr. Medvedev often says his background as a lawyer plays a crucial role in his worldview, and when he was asked about his reputation, he returned to that theme. He said that when he was a student, he learned of the importance of the law, and of the right to private property. He said he also realized that there needed to be a struggle in Russia against what he has termed ''legal nihilism.''
 ''For me, these are the ideas that I absorbed when I studied at university, as well as the value of human rights,'' he said. ''And in our country, they are based on the Constitution. Human rights and freedoms also must be defended unconditionally, and should be the priority of any government. It's up to you as to how this set of values should be described.''
 Asked about his political enemies, Mr. Medvedev conceded that some prominent people were disgruntled about his ascent, though he would not name them.
 ''I am positive that a certain number of politicians and a certain part of the population is not quite happy with the current configuration of power,'' he said. ''But this is what is called democracy.''
 He added: ''It would be ridiculous to name the destructive forces one by one. I am not an adherent of conspiracy theories. In real life, everything is so much simpler, if not banal.''

HEADLINE: On Campus, the '60s Begin to Fade as Liberal Professors Retire

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis. 

 BODY:
When Michael Olneck was standing, arms linked with other protesters, singing ''We Shall Not Be Moved'' in front of Columbia University's library in 1968, Sara Goldrick-Rab had not yet been born.
 When he won tenure at the University of Wisconsin here in 1980, she was 3. And in January, when he retires at 62, Ms. Goldrick-Rab will be just across the hall, working to earn a permanent spot on the same faculty from which he is departing.
 Together, these Midwestern academics, one leaving the professoriate and another working her way up, are part of a vast generational change that is likely to profoundly alter the culture at American universities and colleges over the next decade. 
 Baby boomers, hired in large numbers during a huge expansion in higher education that continued into the '70s, are being replaced by younger professors who many of the nearly 50 academics interviewed by The New York Times believe are different from their predecessors -- less ideologically polarized and more politically moderate. 
 ''There's definitely something happening,'' said Peter W. Wood, executive director of the National Association of Scholars, which was created in 1987 to counter attacks on Western culture and values. ''I hear from quite a few faculty members and graduate students from around the country. They are not really interested in fighting the battles that have been fought over the last 20 years.'' 
 Individual colleges and organizations like the American Association of University Professors are already bracing for what has been labeled the graying of the faculty. More than 54 percent of full-time faculty members in the United States were older than 50 in 2005, compared with 22.5 percent in 1969. How many will actually retire in the next decade or so depends on personal preferences and health, as well as how their pensions fare in the financial markets. 
 Yet already there are signs that the intense passions and polemics that roiled campuses during the past couple of decades have begun to fade. At Stanford a divided anthropology department reunited last year after a bitter split in 1998 broke it into two entities, one focusing on culture, the other on biology. At Amherst, where military recruiters were kicked out in 1987, students crammed into a lecture hall this year to listen as alumni who served in Iraq urged them to join the military. 
 In general, information on professors' political and ideological leanings tends to be scarce. But a new study of the social and political views of American professors by Neil Gross at the University of British Columbia and Solon Simmons at George Mason University found that the notion of a generational divide is more than a glancing impression. ''Self-described liberals are most common within the ranks of those professors aged 50-64, who were teenagers or young adults in the 1960s,'' they wrote, making up just under 50 percent. At the same time, the youngest group, ages 26 to 35, contains the highest percentage of moderates, some 60 percent, and the lowest percentage of liberals, just under a third. 
 When it comes to those who consider themselves ''liberal activists,'' 17.2 percent of the 50-64 age group take up the banner compared with only 1.3 percent of professors 35 and younger.
 ''These findings with regard to age provide further support for the idea that, in recent years, the trend has been toward increasing moderatism,'' the study says.
 The authors are not talking about a political realignment. Democrats continue to overwhelmingly outnumber Republicans among faculty, young and old. But as educators have noted, the generation coming up appears less interested in ideological confrontations, summoning Barack Obama's statement about the elections of 2000 and 2004: ''I sometimes felt as if I were watching the psychodrama of the Baby Boom generation -- a tale rooted in old grudges and revenge plots hatched on a handful of college campuses long ago -- played out on the national stage.''
 With more than 675,000 professors at the nation's more than 4,100 four-year and two-year institutions, it is easy to find faculty members, young and old, who defy any mold. Still, this move to the middle is ''certainly the conventional wisdom,'' said Jack H. Schuster, who along with Martin J. Finkelstein, wrote ''The American Faculty,'' a comprehensive analysis of existing data on the profession. ''The agenda is different now than what it had been.''
 With previous battles already settled, like the creation of women's and ethnic studies departments, moderation can be found at both ends of the political spectrum. David DesRosiers, executive director of the Veritas Fund for Higher Education Reform, which contributes to conservative activities on campuses, said impending retirements present an opportunity. However, he added, ''we're not looking for fights,'' but rather ''a civil dialogue.'' His model? A seminar on great books at Princeton jointly taught by two philosophers, the left-wing Cornel West and the right-wing Robert P. George.
 Changes in institutions of higher education themselves are reinforcing the generational shuffle. Health sciences, computer science, engineering and business -- fields that have tended to attract a somewhat greater proportion of moderates and conservatives -- have grown in importance and size compared with the more liberal social sciences and humanities, where many of the bitterest fights over curriculum and theory occurred.
 At the same time, shrinking public resources overall and fewer tenure-track jobs in the humanities have pushed younger professors in those fields to concentrate more single-mindedly on their careers. Academia, once somewhat insulated from market pressures, is today treated like a business. This switch is a ''major ideological and philosophical shift in how society views higher education,'' Mr. Schuster and Mr. Finkelstein write in ''The American Faculty.''
 And with more women in the ranks (nearly 40 percent of the total in 2005 compared with 17.3 percent in 1969), different sorts of issues like family-friendly benefits have been brought to the table.
 One way to understand the sense that a new mood is emerging on American campuses is to look at the difference between the world that existed when Mr. Olneck was making his way and the one in which Ms. Goldrick-Rab is coming up.
 The '60s Generation
 Michael Olneck slides into a booth at Kabul Restaurant on State Street, a few steps from the sprawling Madison campus and its 41,000 students. ''I was a pink-diaper baby,'' he said pushing his bicycle helmet aside and smoothing the unruly strands of gray hair on his head. 
 His father was a Socialist. Right out of high school, in 1964, Mr. Olneck organized support for the Mississippi Project's black voter-registration drives. Later, he took a bus to Washington to protest the war in Vietnam, served on the strike coordinating committee at Harvard during the American invasion of Cambodia in 1970 and demonstrated at President Nixon's inauguration in 1973.
 Similar events embedded themselves in the minds of many students at the time. A few blocks from the restaurant is a plaque commemorating protests that rattled the university in the 1960s and '70s: the seizure of the student movement by radicals, the deadly bombing of a campus research lab, the clubbing of antiwar demonstrators. 
 Those sorts of experiences are alien to younger professors, Mr. Olneck explained, so ''they may not be as instinctively anti-authoritarian; they just don't have that in their background.'' 
 The protests ultimately died down here and elsewhere. Mr. Olneck ended up in front of the class, and like many academics from his generation, he brought the same spirited questioning and conscience that had animated his student years to his job as an education and sociology professor. 
 Yet to some traditionalists, preoccupations like Mr. Olneck's grated. The conservative philosopher Allan Bloom captured the bitter splits -- better known as the culture wars -- in his influential best seller ''The Closing of the American Mind'' in 1987. He detailed fights over the scarcity of women and people of color in the curriculum, the proliferation of pop-culture courses, doubts about the existence of any eternal truths and new theories that declared moral values to be merely an expression of power. These rancorous disputes often spilled into the nation's political discourse.
 When Mr. Olneck earned his degree, traditional views of American education were also being upended. Radical revisionists ridiculed the view of public education as a beneficent democratic project. They raised questions about equal access, how schools reinforced class differences, and whether social science should, or even could be free of ideology.
 At the start of his career, Mr. Olneck traced the links between where someone's family came from and where they ended up on the economic and social ladder. Although he has done quantitative research, 20 years ago he jettisoned number-centric studies for historical narrative, exploring how schools throughout the 20th century responded to immigrants and diversity. In his work one can detect some of the era's preoccupations when he argues, for instance, that fights over bilingualism and standard English were about power. 
 The same goes for his extracurricular activities. In 1989 he worked to kick the R.O.T.C. off campus because of the Defense Department's ban on homosexuals. (The effort failed.) More recently, his neighborhood was riled by a Walgreens plan to open a drugstore. ''All these people who had protested the war and civil rights,'' Mr. Olneck said, laughing; Walgreens ''didn't know what hit 'em.'' 
 Last fall, he taught Race, Ethnicity and Inequality in American Education, which he introduces in the syllabus: ''Schools in the United States promise equal opportunity. They have not kept that promise. In this course, we will try to find out why.'' Like many sociologists and education researchers, Mr. Olneck said that today both the kinds of analyses and the theories that prevailed when he was in college have changed. Overarching narratives, societal critiques and clarion calls for change -- of the capitalist system or the social structure -- have gone out of style. Today, with advances in statistical methods, many sociologists have moved to model themselves on clinical researchers with large, randomized experiments as their gold standard. In their eyes, this more scientific approach is less explicitly ideological than other kinds of research. 
 Ms. Goldrick-Rab has embraced such experiments. A graduate course she created -- partly based on her research of community colleges -- focused on ''educational opportunity and inequality'' at community colleges, with an ''emphasis on the critical evaluation and assessment of current up-to-date research.''
 Another Wisconsin professor, Erik Olin Wright, a 61-year-old sociologist and a Marxist theorist, described it this way: ''There has been some shift away from grand frameworks to more focused empirical questions.'' 
 As for his own approach, Mr. Wright said, ''in the late '60s and '70s, the Marxist impulse was central for those interested in social justice.'' Now it resides at the margins.
 A New Generation
 ''I was part of a new wave of hires,'' Sara Goldrick-Rab said, peering over the top of her laptop at her favorite off-campus work site, the Espresso Royale cafe. She came to the University of Wisconsin in 2004 and, like Mr. Olneck, has a joint appointment in educational policy studies and sociology, both departments considered among the best in the country.
 Now 31, she grew up in a Washington suburb, Fairfax, Va., when Ronald Reagan was in the White House and corporate mergers were the rage. At George Washington University she was active in a campaign to end the death penalty, but for most of her classmates the late 1990s were marked by economic growth, peace and student apathy.
 ''My generation is not so ideologically driven,'' she said. 
 That doesn't mean she doesn't want to engage a larger audience and influence policy. She considers herself the ''intellectual heir'' of her senior colleagues -- ''It's like working with your grandparents,'' she said fondly -- and she cares deeply about educational inequality, often writing about the subject on a blog she created with her husband. 
 But she also is aware of differences between the generations. 
 A Sensibility Gap
 ''Senior people evaluate us for tenure and the standards they use and what we think is important are different,'' she said. They want to question values and norms; ''we are more driven by data.''
 Her newest project is collaborating on what she calls the ''first rigorous test in the country'' to measure whether needs-based financial aid increases the chances that low-income students will graduate from college. It involves 42 colleges and 6,000 students, and will combine statistics with more in-depth interviews.
 As for partisan politics, when she wrote an article in May for Pajamasmedia.com about welfare reform cutting off poor people's access to higher education, some friends and co-workers were surprised by its appearance on that conservative blog. She said she didn't know; she had not paid attention to its political bent. 
 When Ms. Goldrick-Rab speaks of added pressures on her generation, she talks about being pregnant or taking care of her 17-month-old while trying to earn tenure. The lack of paid leave for mothers is high on her list of complaints about university life. 
 At a conference titled ''Generational Shockwaves,'' sponsored in November by the TIAA-CREF Institute, Joan Girgus, a special assistant to the dean of faculty at Princeton, underscored how these sorts of concerns were increasingly on the minds of younger faculty members. Universities need to focus more on the ''life'' side of the work-life balance ''because faculties historically were almost entirely male and the wives took care of the family side,'' Ms. Girgus said. ''I don't think we can do that anymore.'' Ask Ms. Goldrick-Rab if she believes there is a gap between her generation and the boomers, and she immediately answers yes. 
 Mr. Olneck and Mr. Wright are more cautious. ''Some of my closest colleagues are 25 years younger than I am and I feel absolutely no barrier of sensibility,'' Mr. Wright said. 
 For him, the institutional shifts outweigh any others: ''I don't think the big things have anything to do with generational change, but with financial pressures on education,'' he said.
 Wisconsin is part of the state's university's system, for example, but it receives only 18 percent of its total budget from the Legislature. The rest comes from donations, foundations, federal research grants and corporations. Mr. Wright and Mr. Olneck worry how constantly having a hand out -- particularly to corporations -- may affect attitudes and policies. Mr. Olneck mentioned the long list of labs and classrooms named after companies like Halliburton, Pillsbury and Ford Motor Company.
 The market sensibility may account for what Mr. Olneck and others call an increasing careerism among junior faculty members. Jackson Lears, 62, a historian at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said, ''I don't think that necessarily means a move to the right, but a less overt stance of political engagement.''
 Gerald Graff, president of the Modern Language Association and author of the 1992 book ''Beyond the Culture Wars,'' is more skeptical, saying he hasn't seen evidence of change at the University of Illinois in Chicago, where he teaches English. ''You'd think that the further we get away from the '60s, where a lot of our political attitudes are nurtured, there would be,'' he said, ''but I have to say it doesn't seem to be happening.''
 Certainly some disciplines, like literary studies, seem more resistant to change. Elsewhere, senior faculty members are more likely to hire young scholars in their own mold, while some baby boomers have adopted the attitudes and styles of their younger peers. 
 But as scholars across fields argue, the historical era in which a generation develops -- the Depression, wartime or peaceful affluence -- is a defining moment for its members. ''My generational paradigm is the end of the cold war,'' said Matthew Woessner, a 35-year-old conservative and political scientist at Penn State Harrisburg. He and his wife, April Kelly-Woessner, a political scientist at nearby Elizabethtown College who is a year younger and a moderate, have been analyzing faculty survey responses for a new book. The notion that campuses are naturally radical or the birthplace of social movements, Ms. Kelly-Woessner said, was specific to the 1960s and '70s. ''I think the younger generation does look at it differently.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a generational change in professors at American colleges and universities omitted a source of income for the University of Wisconsin, which is experiencing financial pressures, as are many colleges and universities. In addition to money from the State Legislature and from donations, foundations, federal research grants and corporations, the university also receives money from tuition.

HEADLINE: The Luckiest Girl

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
This year's college graduates owe their success to many factors, from hectoring parents to cherished remedies for hangovers. But one of the most remarkable of the new graduates, Beatrice Biira, credits something utterly improbable: a goat.
 ''I am one of the luckiest girls in the world,'' Beatrice declared at her graduation party after earning her bachelor's degree from Connecticut College. Indeed, and it's appropriate that the goat that changed her life was named Luck.
 Beatrice's story helps address two of the most commonly asked questions about foreign assistance: ''Does aid work?'' and ''What can I do?'' 
 The tale begins in the rolling hills of western Uganda, where Beatrice was born and raised. As a girl, she desperately yearned for an education, but it seemed hopeless: Her parents were peasants who couldn't afford to send her to school.
 The years passed and Beatrice stayed home to help with the chores. She was on track to become one more illiterate African woman, another of the continent's squandered human resources.
 In the meantime, in Niantic, Conn., the children of the Niantic Community Church wanted to donate money for a good cause. They decided to buy goats for African villagers through Heifer International, a venerable aid group based in Arkansas that helps impoverished farming families.
 A dairy goat in Heifer's online gift catalog costs $120; a flock of chicks or ducklings costs just $20.
 One of the goats bought by the Niantic church went to Beatrice's parents and soon produced twins. When the kid goats were weaned, the children drank the goat's milk for a nutritional boost and sold the surplus milk for extra money.
 The cash from the milk accumulated, and Beatrice's parents decided that they could now afford to send their daughter to school. She was much older than the other first graders, but she was so overjoyed that she studied diligently and rose to be the best student in the school.
 An American visiting the school was impressed and wrote a children's book, ''Beatrice's Goat,'' about how the gift of a goat had enabled a bright girl to go to school. The book was published in 2000 and became a children's best seller -- but there is now room for a more remarkable sequel.
 Beatrice was such an outstanding student that she won a scholarship, not only to Uganda's best girls' high school, but also to a prep school in Massachusetts and then to Connecticut College. A group of 20 donors to Heifer International -- coordinated by a retired staff member named Rosalee Sinn, who fell in love with Beatrice when she saw her at age 10 -- financed the girl's living expenses.
 A few years ago, Beatrice spoke at a Heifer event attended by Jeffrey Sachs, the economist. Mr. Sachs was impressed and devised what he jokingly called the ''Beatrice Theorem'' of development economics: small inputs can lead to large outcomes.
 Granted, foreign assistance doesn't always work and is much harder than it looks. ''I won't lie to you. Corruption is high in Uganda,'' Beatrice acknowledges.
 A crooked local official might have distributed the goats by demanding that girls sleep with him in exchange. Or Beatrice's goat might have died or been stolen. Or unpasteurized milk might have sickened or killed Beatrice. 
 In short, millions of things could go wrong. But when there's a good model in place, they often go right. That's why villagers in western Uganda recently held a special Mass and a feast to celebrate the first local person to earn a college degree in America.
 Moreover, Africa will soon have a new asset: a well-trained professional to improve governance. Beatrice plans to earn a master's degree at the Clinton School of Public Service in Arkansas and then return to Africa to work for an aid group.
 Beatrice dreams of working on projects to help women earn and manage money more effectively, partly because she has seen in her own village how cash is always controlled by men. Sometimes they spent it partying with buddies at a bar, rather than educating their children. Changing that culture won't be easy, Beatrice says, but it can be done.
 When people ask how they can help in the fight against poverty, there are a thousand good answers, from sponsoring a child to supporting a grass-roots organization through globalgiving.com. (I've listed specific suggestions on my blog, nytimes.com/ontheground, and on facebook.com/kristof).
 The challenges of global poverty are vast and complex, far beyond anyone's power to resolve, and buying a farm animal for a poor family won't solve them. But Beatrice's giddy happiness these days is still a reminder that each of us does have the power to make a difference -- to transform a girl's life with something as simple and cheap as a little goat.

HEADLINE: A Land Rush Is Likely, So a Lawyer Gets Ready

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WALTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 Chris Denton first got a glimpse of his future and that of much of upstate New York back in April 1999 when he got a phone call to his solo-practice law firm from someone he knew in the petroleum industry. ''Do you know about the Jimerson well?'' Mr. Denton recalled being asked. 
 He did not. 
 ''Well, you're going to have to start studying oil and gas law,'' Mr. Denton said he was told. ''That well came in in excess of 3,500 pounds per square inch bottom hole pressure. It's like a Texas well. You won't be able to do real estate law unless you start learning this stuff. There's going to be a lot of drilling, it's going to mean a lot of money, and you need to learn it now.'' 
 He began studying the next morning.
 Almost a decade later, the 58-year-old Mr. Denton, the son of an Army colonel who taught history at West Point, is still learning it. But he is one of a handful of people who have any grasp of the moving parts as the state lurches toward a new era of natural gas production in the Marcellus Shale formation, which in New York runs from Lake Erie across to the Catskills. 
 There are no guarantees, of course. Wells that look promising can be duds. Legislators could confound powerful gas industry lobbyists and slam on the brakes. Someone might invent a magic energy machine or a hydrogen fuel cell that could replace the gas sitting under pastures in the Catskills. Pigs could fly.
 Far more likely is this: A frenzied land rush that is already making some landowners rich and infuriating others who leased their land too early for too little. Thousands of gas wells drilled upstate, many using more than a million gallons of water laced with dozens of toxic chemicals like hydrochloric acid, benzene, toluene and xylene, to fracture shale thousands of feet underground to release the gas trapped within it. Enormous questions about industrial noise, truck traffic and new roads gouged into hills; about holding ponds created to trap the polluted and spent water used in drilling; about land reclamation; about the effects on the New York watershed.
 Mr. Denton has organized perhaps a hundred forums for farmers and landowners about the leasing process, how to protect themselves, what's at stake. He has also put together several groups of landowners, each group controlling as much as 50,000 acres, so they have some leverage in negotiating economic and environmental issues with national and international energy companies.
 He was in the audience at a forum last week, listening to the cautionary tales told by landowners from Wyoming and Colorado, noting the gas industry representatives, none of whom raised their hands when asked to identify themselves at the start of the meeting.
 The meeting, organized by the Catskill Mountainkeeper environmental group, included both curious landowners and staunch environmentalists, many of whom wanted not to regulate gas drilling in the state, but to stop it.
 ''What I'm hearing is that some people have already given up,'' said one woman near the front of the century-old Walton Theater here. ''And if anybody wants me to make nice to someone who's going to come and rape my land, that's not going to happen. I don't want to live in an industrial zone. I don't want them here. And that's what I want to talk about, how to keep them out. Not how to make nice with them.''
 Mr. Denton, for what it's worth, figures that stopping gas development can't happen, and it shouldn't.
 It can't because all the planets are lined up for vast gas exploration upstate. The price is high, and many of the people with land to lease are poor and desperate. Gas could be an economic bonanza for individuals and state government. The new horizontal drilling technology is far more sophisticated than ever. A similar formation, the Barnett Shale, has been a huge success in Texas, and gas companies are rushing to be sure they get a piece of the next hot play, which is the Marcellus Shale here.
 ''The place to put your money now is in the Northeast,'' Mr. Denton said. ''They're not shooting for 15 or 20 percent return on equity. They're looking for 200 or 300 percent every year. You might hit a dry well, but when you hit one, your return can be extraordinary.''
 AND, in his view, the goal shouldn't be to stop the drilling, because if we want our big cars and big houses and urban empires of light in the Northeast, we can't expect to be an energy consumer and never a producer. 
 ''The Amish are the only people who have any credibility about saying no,'' he said. ''They live what they espouse. If we want our gas-guzzling cars and S.U.V.'s and all the benefits of modern technological society, it's a little hard to understand how we say no.''
 Instead, the question more likely is: Do we do it right? And can we? Federal energy legislation promoted by the Bush administration in 2005 exempted the gas industry from many clean-air and clean-water regulations. Albany, where the state recently passed legislation that made it easier for the Department of Environmental Conservation to issue permits for horizontal drilling, may not be a great bet to do any better than the federal government. 
 The smell of money is in the air, and the game is just starting.

HEADLINE: Drivers' Walkout Has Ripple Effect Across City

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and PATRICK McGEEHAN; David Giambusso and Sharon Otterman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
They were ready to pour the concrete for the fifth floor of a luxury condominium building in Lower Manhattan when more than 400 concrete-truck drivers went on strike. 
 So the concrete waits to be poured and the number of carpenters and other workers at the site fell from 75 on Tuesday to 50 on Wednesday. The number is expected to plunge to 15 on Thursday. 
 ''By next week, there really will be nothing left for them to do,'' said Hans Larof, the assistant superintendent for the project, at Leonard Street and West Broadway. He said that since the strike began on Tuesday morning, the workers have spent their time cleaning up and removing the plywood forms into which concrete had been poured on the lower floors. 
 In recent months, New York City has been throbbing with the pulse of construction and the rumble and roar of concrete-mixing trucks. But the strike has all but halted or greatly slowed work at scores of sites, from the Freedom Tower at ground zero to apartment buildings, idling thousands of construction workers and unnerving developers and contractors in all five boroughs.
 ''It's hurting us pretty badly,'' said John Greaney, the president of Local 608 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, which represents workers on the Upper West Side, in Harlem and in the Bronx. ''A lot of our carpenters have been laid off until the strike is settled. I would say it's in the range of 2,000 members. Without concrete deliveries, we can't proceed.''
 Mr. Greaney noted that many electricians, laborers and wire lathers -- who place steel rebar for pouring concrete -- have also been laid off. But he said he supported the striking drivers because ''they're entitled to what they can get.'' 
 The union that called the walkout, Local 282 of the Teamsters union, is one of the most powerful in the region. Just a few hundred drivers are able to shut down most of the city's multibillion-dollar construction industry.
 ''The delivery of concrete is at the core of the construction process,'' said James B. Jacobs, a labor expert at the New York University School of Law. ''There's nothing more basic. It's an element of all high-rise construction. Anyone who controls that has a tremendous amount of power.''
 Outside the offices of the Quadrozzi Concrete Corporation in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, 15 drivers on strike were camped out on Wednesday, barbecuing chicken and sausage under a blue canopy. Signs reading, ''Local 282'' were hung around the site as the drivers relaxed on lawn chairs.
 John Quadrozzi, the president of the company, whose 50 concrete-mixing trucks stood silent on Wednesday, had some kind words for his workers, who were striking over wages and working conditions. ''These drivers hold higher skills than other drivers,'' he said. ''They're not people you can just replace with any old truck driver.''
 A concrete executive has said the union was asking for raises of 6 percent a year, but a union negotiator disputed that figure. 
 Still, Mr. Quadrozzi criticized the union's wage demands, calling them exorbitant. Speaking of the strike, he said, ''This is going to cost the city a tremendous amount of money.''
 But James Parrott, the chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, said the walkout would not have a major effect.
 ''It seems to mainly involve delay,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean some project won't go forward. It's temporary. These delays can be made up, although there might be some cost involved. You might have to pay some overtime.''
 Mr. Parrott predicted that the strike would be short. ''When was the last time there was a long construction strike in the city?'' he said. There were undeniable ripple effects. At Amsterdam Avenue and 100th Street, a project to build luxury housing was shut down, idling 75 workers.
 ''These guys all had to go home, and everyone has families and mortgages,'' said Alfonso Comello, a foreman at the site.
 Concrete is used not just for building foundations, but also for floors and walls -- it is poured into plywood forms to shape it, with steel rebar used to strengthen it. Concrete is also used for highways and other public works.
 Denise M. Richardson, the acting managing director of the General Contractors Association of New York, said a highway contractor had been prepared for a ''400-yard piece of work'' on Tuesday morning, but when concrete-mixing trucks failed to show up, the crew ''worked around it and got as much other work done as they could.'' 
 On Tuesday, officials from the concrete companies and the union traded angry words after the strike began. Union officials expressed annoyance that officials from several concrete producers had broken what the union said was an agreement not to discuss details of the negotiations with the news media. Moreover, union officials complained that the companies had misrepresented their bargaining position. 
 On Wednesday, the two sides sought to mend fences. Local 282 and the Association of New York City Ready Mix Concrete Producers, an industry group, issued a joint statement saying, ''Although issues still divide us, there have been ongoing and good-faith efforts by the parties to reach an agreement that will be fair and equitable to all concerned. The parties will meet in the next few days in an attempt to fully resolve this dispute'' and ''to get everyone back to work.''
 City officials have talked to both sides but have not intervened. Jason Post, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said, ''We encourage both sides to resolve their differences.''
 With each passing day without concrete, contractors will be more inclined to send workers home as the cost of delays eats into their potential profits, said Ms. Richardson, of the contractors association. The costs of falling behind would be borne by the contractors, who, in most cases, do not have much protection against strikes, she said. 
 ''To a certain extent, concrete is to a construction project like food is to a human,'' Ms. Richardson said. ''You can go for a period of time without food, but at some point you need to eat.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 4, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Thursday about the halting or slowing of work at construction sites in New York City because of a strike by concrete-truck drivers misidentified, in some copies, the site described in the first three paragraphs, where workers had been ready to pour concrete for the fifth floor before the strike and the number of workers had fallen to 50 from 75. The project is a luxury condominium building in Lower Manhattan, not a new building for New York Law School. (That project, which has also been delayed because of the strike, is across the street from the residential building).

HEADLINE: Recognition for a People Who Faded as Japan Grew

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: NIBUTANI, Japan 

 BODY:
The Ainu had lived on Japan's northernmost island for centuries, calling their home Ainu Mosir, or Land of Human Beings. Here, they had fished, hunted, worshiped nature and established a culture that yielded ''Yukar,'' an oral poem of Homeric length.
 But just as with America's expansion West, the Japanese pushed north in the late 19th century in the first sign of their imperialist ambitions. Japanese settlers decimated the Ainu population, seized their land and renamed it Hokkaido, or North Sea Road.
 And yet it was only a few weeks ago that the Japanese government finally, and unexpectedly, recognized the Ainu as an ''indigenous people.'' Parliament introduced and quickly passed a resolution stating that the Ainu had a ''distinct language, religion and culture,'' setting aside the belief, long expressed by conservatives, that Japan is an ethnically homogeneous nation.
 The recognition -- coming after decades of opposition by a government fearful of compensation claims -- seemed timed to an international conference of indigenous peoples that Japan is hosting this week in Hokkaido. The Ainu's lack of recognition could have proved embarrassing for Japan's government, particularly since the conference also comes close to the Group of 8 summit meeting in Hokkaido next week. 
 In Hokkaido, and particularly in towns like Nibutani that have a high concentration of Ainu, official recognition has engendered strong emotions ranging from satisfaction at a long-sought status to suspicion that Tokyo's commitment to the Ainu will not last beyond the summit meeting.
 ''We were really deeply moved,'' said Tadashi Kato, president of the Ainu Association of Hokkaido, the country's largest organization of Ainu. ''I felt that, not only our members, but especially our ancestors were rejoicing, even though they were of course silent. We couldn't hold back our tears.''
 Mr. Kato, 69, added: ''Some people are saying that this is meaningless. But that's not the point. That Parliament approved this is big -- this is the first step.''
 What, then, is the next step? Is it to reclaim traditional lands or argue for special hunting or fishing rights, as indigenous peoples elsewhere have done? Is it to ask for an apology? Mr. Kato was not saying just yet, and opinions here were divided.
 Complicating matters is the government's studiously vague recognition of the Ainu as an indigenous people. So far, it has not said whether recognition will entail certain rights and has indicated that its own definition of ''indigenous people'' will be narrower than the one adopted by the United NationsGeneral Assembly last year in its Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
 Japan voted for the nonbinding declaration, but the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand opposed it on the grounds that it went too far in giving indigenous peoples rights over land and legislation. Still, in recent months, Canada and Australia have offered apologies for mistreating their indigenous populations in the past, and New Zealand transferred about 435,000 acres of plantation forest and forest rents to seven Maori tribes.
 Shiro Kayano, director of the Nibutani Ainu Museum here, said the Japanese government should follow other governments' examples and offer the Ainu a broad apology, though he was pessimistic.
 ''In other countries, governments have reflected on and apologized for their mistaken policies of the past, but the Japanese government will never do that,'' said Mr. Kayano, 50, who is the son of the late Shigeru Kayano, the first -- and so far only -- Ainu to have been elected a national lawmaker.
 Mr. Kayano's museum -- with its displays of traditional thatch houses and clothes made of bark -- occupies a central spot in Nibutani, a town where 64 of its 190 families have registered themselves as Ainu. In the town center, a large red sign, ''Nibutani, home of the Yukar,'' and a single, modest restaurant called Bee's and offering ''Ainu cuisine'' are the only tip-offs that Nibutani is not your average Japanese town.
 On the edge of town, next to a river and the entrance of the forest, Yasuko Yamamichi runs an Ainu language school and called the official recognition ''empty.'' She also wanted an apology but, like other Ainu interviewed, was hesitant about reclaiming traditional lands.
 ''It's a little late for the Ainu to start telling the Japanese to do this and that,'' Ms. Yamamichi, 61, said.
 In a study by the Hokkaido prefectural government in 2006, just under 24,000 people identified themselves as Ainu. Most were of mixed blood and lacked the telltale fair skin or hirsute features that distinguished older Ainu from the Japanese. But it is not known how many live outside Hokkaido since Japan has never conducted a nationwide census of Ainu.
 The study found that 3.8 percent of Ainu received welfare benefits, compared with 2.5 percent of the non-Ainu living in the same communities. Only 17.4 percent of the Ainu had graduated from college, less than half of the 38.5 percent for the rest of the population.
 ''There is certainly a gap between the Ainu and the general population, but the gap is far smaller compared to, say, Native Americans or Inuits,'' said Teruki Tsuneomoto, a law professor and director of the Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies at the University of Hokkaido.
 But the downside is that the Ainu have few of the special rights granted to indigenous peoples elsewhere and all but a minority were absorbed into the larger culture, said Mr. Tsuneomoto, who is not Ainu. ''In Japan's case, for better or for worse, the assimilation policies since the Meiji era were so successful that almost nothing remains of the Ainu's traditional way of life,'' he said.
 In 1869, one year after the start of the Meiji era, Tokyo set up the Hokkaido Colonization Board to encourage Japanese settlers to move to Hokkaido. The Ainu were eventually stripped of their land, forced to abandon hunting and fishing for farming, forbidden to speak their own language and taught only Japanese at school. That history -- little known by the Japanese today and even among the Ainu themselves -- was repeated later in Japan's Asian colonies.
 ''That's why I think it's a good thing that Japan lost World War II,'' said Koichi Kaizawa, 60, an official at the Biratori Ainu Culture Preservation Association. ''If Japan had won, so many others would have lost their language and culture.''
 But Jin Sunazawa, 45, a businessman, said he did not feel the ''hostility toward the Japanese government'' that some older Ainu did. Economic independence, he said, should be the Ainu's leading priority.
 ''It's not healthy to keep blaming discrimination or history, and not work and pay taxes,'' Mr. Sunazawa said.
 ''I don't think assimilation is bad,'' he added. ''I'm Sunazawa first, Ainu second.''

HEADLINE: A Diverse Brooklyn, With Meatballs

BYLINE: By MIKE ALBO

 BODY:
IKEA, the Swedish home furnishings juggernaut, has just opened an outlet in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The gigantic bright blue and yellow building looks like the Embassy of Legoland and is completely incongruous with the craggy brick factory buildings of this historic but rapidly gentrifying waterfront village. 
 The huge store went up so fast I would believe you if you said it had been constructed by space aliens: a huge parking garage; a 6.5-acre esplanade and two floors that hold a 450-seat cafeteria; a children's playroom; a vast marketplace (it's like Pier 1, Bed Bath & Beyond and Conran all in one); and the showroom, where thematic areas (kitchens and dining, bedrooms, wall units and media storage) are on a clearly marked yet somehow still confusing pathway. You make a note of what you want and then go to the adjoining, jaw-droppingly huge self-serve furniture area to pick up a flat-packed version of your product. 
 I wandered aimlessly through the showroom, which has model interiors set up here and there, all displaying the way I wish I lived: a dirt-free, stain-free world where there are no toothpaste stains, wine spills or oil spots from late-night pizza. 
 ''My loft is the most important place in the world,'' was written on a wall above a photo of a surfer dude holding a skateboard and guitar. Behind the wall was a 235-square-foot space where this dude presumably lived: a mountain bike hung on sturdy hooks, stacks of blank CDs were neatly shelved and a flat screen television blared ironic cartoons. Every single thing in the room had a price tag. Picture frames for $24.99. Skubb closet organizers, $6.99. An Utby tabletop in black, $139.99. And a painfully familiar metallic Tromso loft bed frame, $249. I slept on that thing from 1992 to 1994. The sight of it brought the nauseating memory-taste of ramen noodles to my mouth.
 Walking around and around the showroom, I kept confronting the decor of my yesterdays: the W-shaped bookshelf I thought looked cool in my East Village apartment years ago ($29.99); those cute colored plastic 99-cent containers I had in my shower in Brooklyn Heights; worst of all, a full-length mirror cut into a tacky squiggle ($9.99), which I saw in the apartments of various parties from my wild early 20s. It was named the Krabb. 
 Some items I had not seen before. The Mandal, a tall wooden wardrobe, was smooth and simple ($399). The Sandnes, a narrow cabinet, had drawers that pull out at an angle and would work perfectly in a New York apartment hallway ($99.99). Far away from any real home, everything looked efficient, minimal, clean and had cute Swedish names. 
 But we all know what happens to this stuff when you get it back to your place. If you aren't a member of an heirloom-rich Mayflower family, chances are you have slept on an Ikea bed, stacked your clacky CD cases in an Ikea CD tower, arranged your college paperbacks on an Ikea shelf and then, five years later, thrown that dusty, linty, banged-up piece of furniture out onto the curb.
 A lot of this cheap stuff is cheaply made. A chest with drawers for $69.99 had rough undersides of compressed wood. The back of a $249 vanity table had ugly exposed screws. The rear of a $279 three-drawer chest was constructed of thin particle board, bound with tape. These things will totally be on a curb in a few years. 
 STILL, Ikea is about affordability, and these days, a lot of us can only afford furniture within the price range of our economic stimulus checks. The staff, wearing yellow short-sleeve polo shirts, are bright, chipper and freshly trained. I watched one clerk explain the warranty on a kitchen cabinet to an Eastern European man and his mother. ''Sorry about the confusion!'' he said as they walked away. 
 Equally chipper control-freak signs hang everywhere. ''Why should I clean my own table?'' says one in the cafeteria, where I stopped for a bite to eat. ''At Ikea, cleaning your own table at the end of your meal is one of the reasons you paid less at the start!'' The famous Swedish meatball entree was only $4.99, but I went for the large salad, which at $3.99 was a steal. I settled myself in front of one of the wide windows, and gazed out over the expansive Red Hook landscape, as a baby with a scream like shattering glass wailed next to me.
 Red Hook is going from dangerous to artsy to family-friendly faster that you can say Corcoran Group. Along with Ikea, a Fairway has opened, and there is a cruise terminal so tourists can take in the beautiful view of Lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty. 
 Ikea has become a lodestone for heated discussion about the future of this village, and Brooklyn in general. Google ''Ikea Brooklyn,'' and you find a flurry of blogs, Web sites and organizations contending that the Ikea project forced unfair changes in the zoning rules, broke environmental laws during construction and, in a cultural sense, bleeds Brooklyn of its character and charm.
 Still, it is here now, and I suppose we have to make lemonade. Sure, it furthers Red Hook's transformation into the Paramus Park shopping mall in New Jersey. Yes, it may bring traffic and inauthenticity to the area. But walking through the maze of home furnishings, I saw what I love about Brooklyn: everyone. 
 A middle-aged woman was buying bathroom slippers; a gay couple was deciding on a kitchen countertop; two Muslim women in beautifully printed silk head-scarves were inspecting the sliding walls of a bedroom closet; a Latino family was deciding on bunk beds for their excited daughters. This store is for everyday Brooklynites needing something cheap and relatively well designed, even if the stuff is of dicey quality and doesn't last forever. When you see Ikea furniture on curbs around town, at least you'll know that these everyday Brooklynites can still afford to live in Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Real Estate, Life and Possibly Arson

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
 Four years ago, Kathleen McCleary's husband had a job offer in a consulting firm working for the Department of Homeland Security. They had been living in Oregon, which they loved, but, according to Ms. McCleary, it was one of the states that led the country in unemployment in the tech market, in which her husband worked. 
 ''Working on antiterrorism had a lot of job security,'' she said, so the couple and their two daughters sold their house and moved to a suburb of Washington, D.C. 
 For Ms. McCleary, leaving her house was the most agonizing part of the move: it was a 1930s Cape Cod style, only 1,800 square feet, but she adored it. 
 ''It was so personal, because we had all the tough years of our early marriage there,'' she said, meaning those years of being in the weeds -- raising two young children and scraping by, while she worked as a magazine editor and freelance writer and her husband earned his Ph.D. 
 Adrift in a new town, Ms. McCleary asked the local coffee shop for a job as a barista one day a week. The rest of the week she spent writing her first novel, about a woman whose husband wants to move the family for a business opportunity; they sell the house, then she promptly decides to burn it down. 
 The result, ''House & Home'' (Hyperion; $23.95), is a sharply funny, nicely realized work of catharsis that will be satisfyingly familiar to anyone who has ever suffered seller's remorse.

HEADLINE: Mongolia Enforces Martial Law in Capital Amid Political Unrest

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Armed soldiers enforced martial law on the streets of Mongolia's capital on Wednesday, a day after five people were killed as hundreds angered by election results rioted, Mongolian state news media reported. 
 President Nambaryn Enkhbayar responded to the unrest by declaring a national state of emergency late Tuesday. 
 Mongolia's national news agency, Montsame, said 710 people had been detained after groups of protesters, alleging fraud in last weekend's parliamentary elections, clashed with the police in the capital, Ulan Bator. Preliminary results of the elections gave a parliamentary majority to the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the successor to the country's Communist Party, which dominated the nation when it was a puppet of the Soviet Union. 
 The opposition Democratic Party rejected the election results but disavowed the violence, Reuters reported. 
 Both political parties held closed meetings on Tuesday, and Parliament was planning to hold a special session to address the crisis, the national news agency reported. ''At this moment, the situation in the capital city is relatively normal,'' the Ulan Bator police chief, Amarbold, said on state television, according to Reuters. ''It is very peaceful compared to yesterday, but the troops need to stay on the street.''
 Landlocked between Russia and China, Mongolia is a remote and hauntingly beautiful country embraced by the Bush administration both for its strategic value and its emergence as a new democracy since the fall of the Soviet Union. The country is also rich in mineral resources and has seen its gross national product soar as foreign investment in mining has hit record highs. At the same time, Mongolia is a country where many people herd animals in the grasslands and enjoy little better than a subsistence livelihood.
 The UB Post, an English-language newspaper in Ulan Bator, reported that 74 percent of the country's 1.6 million eligible voters cast ballots in Sunday's races. It also reported that the People's Revolutionary Party had won at least half of the 76 legislative seats even as votes were still being counted. ''Based on information we got through our primary units, we have won all mandates in nine provinces,'' Yo Otgonbayar, secretary general of the party, said at a news conference in Ulan Bator.
 A 16-member team of international election observers confirmed the results of the race. Leaders of the Democratic Party disagreed with the preliminary results but also wanted to meet with the People's Revolutionary Party to defuse the crisis.
 ''From the Sea of Japan to the eastern border of Europe, we are the only functioning democracy, and we have a duty to save it,'' the Democratic Party leader, Tsakhiagyn Elbegdorj, told Reuters.

HEADLINE: For Nascar Fans, High Price of Gas Is Not Only Catalyst for Cutting Back Travel

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: LOUDON, N.H. 

 BODY:
Steven and Nancy Swiantek sat on the roof of their recreational vehicle before the start of a Nascar Sprint Cup race Sunday. The panorama was magnificent, but their perch cost more than it used to.
 It cost the Swianteks $900 to park on a grassy ridge overlooking the backstretch at New Hampshire Motor Speedway and another $250 for tickets to watch a weekend full of qualifying and racing. And that does not include the $250 in gas it took to fill their R.V. for the 175-mile trip from their home in Cromwell, Conn. The cost to fuel their vehicle was almost twice as much as last year, a factor that led the Swianteks to cancel trips this season to races in Dover, Del., and Richmond, Va.
 ''We always have a good time and there are always good people wherever we go, but it's just a matter of money,'' Steven Swiantek said.
 The Swianteks are among many stock car fans feeling the pinch of rising gas prices and a sagging economy. Nascar fans are famous for traveling long distances to watch 43 gas-guzzling cars chug around a track hundreds of times, but with gas at $4 a gallon, or higher, they are being forced to rethink their travel plans. 
 Four hours before last Sunday's race, track officials announced that all 101,000 seats had been sold -- the 27th straight sellout at the track. But there were large gaps of empty seats, their silver backs shining in the sun, outside the third and fourth turns of the oval.
 Nascar and the tracks that host Sprint Cup races do not release official attendance figures, but according to Nascar estimates, attendance figures have been lower at 10 of 17 races this season. Attendance has gone up at only one race, the season-opening Daytona 500.
 Attendance has dropped at four of the last six races, most notably at the LifeLock 400 at Michigan International Speedway, where an estimated 115,000 fans attended a Sprint Cup race June 15. A crowd estimated at 145,000 attended the same race a year ago.
 ''Michigan was an eye-opener for us,'' the Nascar spokesman Jim Hunter said. ''That's the heart of the automobile industry. That one hit home more than any other because of where it is.''
 Hunter said that a hard-core stock car fan usually attends four to six races a year. That number, he said last week, is down to two to four. Ratings for races televised by Fox increased 2 percent over last year, something Hunter said could be attributed to rising gas prices.
 ''Our hard-core fan, if he's feeling pinched, he'll cut back on the number of races that he goes to, because he knows he can see it on TV,'' Hunter said.
 The announced attendance at Pocono Raceway for a Sprint Cup race on June 8 was 105,000, the same as a year ago, but the infield at the two-and-a-half-mile track was significantly emptier than it had been during past races.
 Attendance for the Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend at Lowe's Motor Speedway, near Charlotte, N.C., dropped to 160,000 from 175,000. A week later, attendance at the Best Buy 400 in Dover was 133,000, down from 145,000 in 2007.
 ''The gas prices are probably the most visible of the obstacles that the customers face,'' Denis McGlynn, the president and chief officer at Dover International Speedway, said in a telephone interview last week. ''But it's the hotel room, the food costs -- it's everything all blended in. Those discretionary dollars are just drying up.''
 Dover also hosts a Sprint Cup race in September that is the second of 10 races in the Chase to the Sprint Cup, Nascar's version of the playoffs. McGlynn said some fans might have skipped the June race in favor of going to a more meaningful race later in the year.
 Eric Bourgeois, a fan from East Haddam, Conn., took his camper back to New Hampshire this year, but he had something new: a propane grill to cook food that he had bought at a supermarket. He was also parked in a new spot.
 ''The guy who had it just couldn't do it anymore,'' Bourgeois said. ''He just couldn't afford to do it.''
 Gary Baber, a friend of Bourgeois's, said: ''It's getting to the point where I'm picking and choosing which races I can go to. All the expendable cost is going into the fuel tank. It's kind of putting a curb on what we love to do.''
 Higher gas prices also affect how fans spend their money once they get to the track. Corrine Gaskill, whose father is the president of Race Ready Communications, a company in Absecon, N.J., that sells scanners, staffed a trailer outside New Hampshire Motor Speedway that drew virtually no foot traffic Friday afternoon.
 Rita Wilkin of Romney, N.H., about 50 miles from Loudon, is a fan of Dale Earnhardt Jr., who switched teams in the off-season and has new sponsors and a new number, 88, on his car. Wilkin was resisting the urge to buy new Earnhardt merchandise.
 ''I'm not going to do it this year,'' she said.
 Meanwhile, Joe Baumann had decided to take the weekend off from Nascar. Baumann, from Erie, Pa., drew attention from Nascar in 2004 for attending all 36 races in what was then the Nextel Cup Series. He plans to attend 20 to 22 races this year.
 Many fans say they like to go to the races because they are gathering places as well as spectacles. 
 But Baumann said he was cutting back because he said he thought the races, with boxier, safer cars, were not as exciting as they used to be. Races, he said, tend to become parades.
 ''If you've been to Bristol, or Martinsville, you know that rubbin' is racin','' Baumann said in a telephone interview.
 He skipped a trip to Pocono, seven hours to the east in Long Pond, Pa., and attended the race in Michigan because it is 300 miles from his home. A trip to Daytona Beach, Fla., for a July 5 race would cost him $1,200 to $1,300 in diesel fuel to fill up his 40-foot trailer.
 ''It's craziness,'' he said.
 Nascar and track officials cannot do much about the price of gas -- which was running at $3.95 a gallon on Sunday at the two gas stations closest to New Hampshire Motor Speedway -- but they say they can do more to give fans their money's worth.
 Officials at the track, which was purchased late last year by the racing magnate O. Bruton Smith, announced earlier this month that they would hold drawings for $500 gas cards.
 They also announced that the music group Kansas would hold a prerace concert, and that the festivities would include a motorcycle show and an elephant race. (The elephant race was canceled because of a lack of permits and health certifications.)
 ''My job, as a promoter here, is to convince people to come here -- to make this race one of the two or three they go to,'' said Jerry Gappens, the new general manager of the track. ''I want this to be a state fair and a Super Bowl and everything in between.''
 Even if he accomplishes that, he knows his job is a lot tougher than it used to be. 
 ''We're not just competing against race tracks,'' he said, ''but we're competing against baseball and football, and we're competing against all aspects of being entertained.''

HEADLINE: 2 Sides in Con Ed Talks Each Held a Strong Hand

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Labor negotiations often take place in a fishbowl, with the two sides huddled behind closed doors to hammer out agreements across big conference tables. So it was with the four-year contract between Consolidated Edison and its leading union that emerged before daybreak on Wednesday after marathon overnight talks at the State Labor Department headquarters downtown.
 The pact, which union officials expect their nearly 9,000 members to approve as early as next week, was the result of a mix of factors, including the health of New York's economy, a demand for utility workers nationally, and pressures on corporations, particularly publicly traded ones, to lower costs. Seen through that prism, labor and management both made concessions, but also had leverage to win points in their negotiations. 
 By some measures, Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America had a lot going for it when negotiations began in mid-June. Electricity use in New York City has jumped 20 percent in the last decade, thanks to a boom in home and office construction, and an explosion of air-conditioners, computers, flat-panel televisions and other appliances filling the new buildings.
 As a result, Con Edison has rushed to build more substations, add extra transformers and lay thousands of miles of new cables. The utility is also filling jobs being vacated by retiring baby boomers and positions left open because of previous cuts.
 All that means new workers: Con Edison has hired more than 1,200 people in each of the past three years, and its total work force has grown by 11 percent since 2003, to around 14,000.
 There is also a shortage of line workers, cable splicers and electrical engineers nationally as technically minded young people are lured into newer industries like biotechnology. And fast-growing states like Nevada, where the cost of living is so much lower, can lure workers willing to relocate.
 ''The power industry has this image problem,'' said G. T. Heydt, a professor of electrical engineering at Arizona State University. ''Students think it's a Thomas Edison-era industry. Even the worst students are getting a lot of offers.''
 Both sides refused to release the specific terms of the agreement on Wednesday, but union officials said that they had won annual wage increases roughly in line with the inflation rate of about 4 percent, a significant jump from Con Edison's original offer of 1.5 percent. Most jobs at the utility have starting wages around $15 an hour; experienced employees in highly skilled positions can make as much as $40 an hour.
 While the competitive labor market in the power industry put the union in a good negotiating position, the utility had the advantage of negotiating during an economic slowdown, with rising gas and food prices making a picket line particularly unattractive.
 ''The economy in general is tough,'' said John F. Miksad, the senior vice president of electric operations at Con Edison. ''It's not a good place to be out of work. The fact they didn't strike is part of that.''
 The utility was also aware that New Yorkers are clamoring to land jobs at Con Edison, which officials said received 68,000 applications for 1,300 spots last year. Still, union officials say that the work is hard and even dangerous -- dealing with high-voltage wires, working outdoors in the heat and cold -- and that the utility, while benevolent in some ways, has some draconian rules.
 ''The reality is they are a very, very tough outlet to work for,'' said Joe Flaherty, a spokesman for Local 1-2. ''Their policies are formulated so no one can beat the system.''
 Though New York State has the most heavily unionized work force in the country, organized labor is under pressure from consumers, politicians and shareholders. 
 Like many other companies across America, Con Edison wanted to create a two-tier retirement plan that would include 401(k)-style benefits for new workers to reduce its long-term obligations.
 The union ultimately thwarted the effort, but conceded that its members would have to pay for more of their health care to help the company rein in skyrocketing costs.

HEADLINE: Big Job Cuts Announced At American

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
American Airlines expects to cut nearly 7,000 employees by the end of the year, or about 8 percent of its worldwide work force, as it reduces flights and grounds aircraft because of high fuel costs, the airline told employees Wednesday.
 American said in a regulatory filing that it expected to record a second-quarter charge of as much as $1.3 billion to account for the job reductions and to write down the value of the MD-80 and Embraer 135 regional jets that it is retiring as it eliminates flights. 
 The job cuts, which appear to be twice as big as those announced so far by any other carrier, could affect as many as 900 flight attendants. 
 In a message posted on its Web site, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants said Wednesday that it had received notice from American of its intent to lay off union members with the least seniority. The exact number will depend on how many older workers agree to take voluntary retirement packages, the airline told the union.
 In an e-mail memorandum to employees, Jeffrey J. Brundage, American's senior vice president for human resources, said the airline expected its job reductions to mirror the 8 percent cut in worldwide flights it plans by the end of the year.
 American, the largest domestic carrier and a division of the AMR Corporation, announced in May that it would cut flights by 11 percent to 12 percent in the United States, and by about 8 percent over all.
 ''While we are still working through the specific impact to employee work groups, both voluntary and involuntary, employee reductions commensurate with the overall system capacity reductions are expected companywide as we reduce the size of the airline,'' Mr. Brundage said in the memorandum.
 ''It's crucial that we take the appropriate actions to operate a strong and competitive airline for both our employees and customers,'' he added.
 American has about 85,500 employees, so an 8 percent cut would equal about 6,840 jobs. American has previously said that it plans to cut its management and support staff jobs by about 8 percent.
 ''These are difficult but necessary changes given the unprecedented challenges we face with overcapacity in the industry, skyrocketing fuel prices, and a worsening U.S. economy,'' said Tim Wagner, an American spokesman.
 American hopes many of its job reductions can be achieved through voluntary steps, Mr. Wagner added. He said the airline did not have figures available for job cuts it plans in other areas. 
 The layoffs would be effective Aug. 31. American has about 18,000 flight attendants. 
 American is in the midst of contract negotiations with the flight attendants union and also is holding discussions with its pilots' union.
 Mr. Brundage said American had agreed on an early-retirement deal covering flight attendants and members of the Transport Workers Union, which represents mechanics and ground workers. 
 Airlines have been hit hard by a rise in the price of jet fuel, which is up more than 80 percent over 2007. They have raised fares, imposed surcharges and set new fees, like the $15 charge American began last month for many passengers to check a bag.
 United Airlines said last month that it planned to eliminate 1,100 jobs, up from a previous estimate of 500 jobs. As part of the move, United said it planned to lay off 950 pilots, and is expected to announce further employee cuts. 
 Continental Airlines also announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs, although it has not been specific about which jobs will be eliminated.
 Including the cuts disclosed Wednesday by American, airlines have said they plan to cut about 30,000 jobs this year. 
 If job cuts continue at that pace, 2008 will be the second-worst year this decade for job reductions in the airline industry, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a firm that tracks employment data. Airlines laid off more than 100,000 workers in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington.
 Meanwhile, AirTran Airways told employees that it wanted to cut their pay by an average of 10 percent, in an effort to fight higher fuel costs.
 Robert Fornaro, the chief executive at AirTran, said in an e-mail message to employees Wednesday that the airline hoped the cut would be temporary and last for six months. But ''we may need to do more in the future,'' Mr. Fornaro said. 
 The pay cut, which would range from 5 percent for some workers to 15 percent for executives, would affect all levels of employees. Mr. Fornaro said AirTran wants the cuts to begin Aug. 1, and was continuing to hold discussions with its unions.

HEADLINE: Paulson Calls for Giving Regulators More Powers

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. called on Wednesday for a new regulatory system that would prevent future financial turmoil while allowing even large financial institutions to fail without risking a wider market collapse. 
 Mr. Paulson, who spoke in London as part of his European tour this week, also predicted that turmoil in the financial markets and a slowdown in economic growth in the United States would continue for some time because of high oil prices and a soft housing market. 
 But he added that foreign direct investment, including from sovereign wealth funds, was ''very healthy'' and could help repair the current levels of global imbalances.
 ''Sovereign wealth fund money should be welcomed,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''The only way not to welcome that money is when it's politically driven. But as far as we can see the vast majority is being driven by interest in getting a higher risk-adjusted rate of return.''
 Mr. Paulson called on financial institutions to raise more capital ''while it's available'' to weather the prolonged market turmoil. 
 While regulators catch up with more than a decade of innovation in the financial markets, the focus needs to be on restoring market stability, and that will take some time, Mr. Paulson said. He called the regulatory system ''outdated,'' saying the financial landscape had changed and financial institutions other than banks were playing a significantly greater role. 
 ''Looking beyond the current market challenges of today, we need to create a resolution process that ensures the financial system can withstand the failure of a large, complex financial firm,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''To do this we will need to give our regulators additional emergency authority to limit temporary disruptions.''
 He said that any new regulation must give the Federal Reserve, the United States' central bank, access to information from all types of financial institutions, including investment banks, and tools that would reduce risk to the financial system without creating the sense that any troubled institution would be bailed out. Allowing institutions to believe that bailouts are available could damage market discipline, he said. 
 Mr. Paulson met Wednesday with Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, Britain's treasury chief, and is to meet with Mr. Darling again on Thursday. British financial regulation is in the middle of its biggest overhaul in a decade.

HEADLINE: Bush Asks for Help, Abroad and at Home, in Sending Aid to Africa

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Thom Shanker contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Amid signs that his quest for more aid to Africa is in danger of unraveling, President Bush called Wednesday for Congress to renew his global AIDS initiative and urged other nations to live up to their own promises to fight poverty and disease on the continent. 
 ''We need people who not only make promises, but write checks, for the sake of human rights and human dignity, and for the sake of peace,'' Mr. Bush said in the White House Rose Garden. ''Accountability is really important when it comes to our work on the continent of Africa.''
 The White House regards aid to Africa, including the AIDS program, which focuses primarily on Africa, as one of Mr. Bush's signature foreign policy achievements. But as Mr. Bush heads to Japan next week for his last meeting as president with the industrialized nations known as the Group of 8, the effort has run into roadblocks abroad and at home. 
 On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are stalled over a plan to renew Mr. Bush's global AIDS program by providing $50 billion for the initiative over the next five years. The White House had hoped to have the renewal in hand by the time Mr. Bush arrived in Japan, but a handful of Senate Republicans object to certain provisions in the bill and are blocking it. 
 Among them is Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who has said the bill is too expensive at a time of budget deficits. 
 The White House deputy press secretary, Tony Fratto, said Mr. Bush remained ''very optimistic'' that Congress would pass the global AIDS bill. ''All of the discussions have been positive,'' he said.
 But there are signs that other Group of 8 countries may backtrack on a promise they made in 2005 to double development assistance to Africa by 2010 for an increase of $25 billion. In addition to the United States, the Group of 8 includes Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Russia.
 A communique being prepared for this year's meeting says the countries are ''firmly committed'' to doubling the assistance, but it makes no mention of the $25 billion figure, according to people familiar with the draft.
 Aid to Africa tops a long list of agenda items for Mr. Bush, including climate change and the global food crisis, as he goes to the meeting next week. 
 The president also used Wednesday's Rose Garden appearance to say anew that he favored diplomacy as the best course to deal with Iran.
 While Mr. Bush has used that language before, his remarks followed a major military exercise by Israel last month that American officials say appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. 
 At the Pentagon on Wednesday, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stressed the ''need for better clarity, even dialogue at some level'' with Iran to avoid a military confrontation that could further destabilize the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Not Just Hartford's Problems

 BODY:
Connecticut's capital city is in trouble. Shootings in Hartford have injured more than 100 people this year and killed at least six. A former deputy mayor was beaten and robbed while walking to breakfast. Gov. M. Jodi Rell has brought in state police to help, but that promises only temporary relief. In the last few years, troopers have been summoned repeatedly while little has been done to address Hartford's more fundamental problems. 
 These problems are shared by cities elsewhere: soaring crime, high dropout rates and low home ownership that leads to punishing property taxes imposed on a dwindling base. But cities in Connecticut bear a special burden: each municipality is asked to fend for itself and compete for resources. As a result, one of the richest states in the country has three of the nation's poorest cities: Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven. 
 Urban decline is dragging down the state, which has experienced little job growth in 20 years. At a time of high energy costs, densely populated cities should be treated as solutions to economic development, not impediments. Connecticut's leaders need to work together to shape a new vision for the state's cities. 
 As a first step, Governor Rell and leaders of the Legislature should appoint a high-level commission, like the one that grappled with Connecticut's transportation issues in 2001. The resulting plan -- with a multibillion-dollar price tag -- has helped address highway gridlock. 
 Most of Connecticut's politicians would rather duck this issue since solutions will inevitably require wealthier towns and suburbs to share their resources with poorer municipalities. Economists see little improvement for the whole state unless its cities turn around.

HEADLINE: In New Shake-Up, McCain Campaign Shifts Managers

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain's presidential campaign has gone through its second shake-up in a year. Responding to Republican concerns that his candidacy was faltering, Mr. McCain put a veteran of President Bush's 2004 campaign in charge of day-to-day operations, and stepped away from a plan to have the campaign run by 11 regional managers, Mr. McCain's aides said Wednesday.
 The elevation of Steve Schmidt -- who worked closely with Karl Rove -- at Mr. McCain's headquarters represented a sharp diminishment of the responsibilities of Rick Davis, who has been Mr. McCain's campaign manager since the last shake-up nearly a year ago.
 The shift was approved by Mr. McCain after several of his aides, including Mr. Schmidt, went to him about 10 days ago and warned him that he was in danger of losing the presidential election unless he revamped his campaign operation, two officials close to the campaign said. 
 The move of Mr. Schmidt is the latest sign of increasing influence of veterans of Mr. Rove's shop in the McCain operation. Nicolle Wallace, communications director for Mr. Bush in the 2004 campaign (and in his White House), has joined the campaign as a senior adviser, and will travel with Mr. McCain every other week. 
 Greg Jenkins, another veteran of Mr. Rove's operation who is a former Fox News producer and director of presidential advance in the Bush White House, was hired by Mr. Schmidt last week after a series of what Mr. McCain's advisers acknowledged were poorly executed campaign events.
 Mr. Rove, who was Mr. Bush's senior political adviser until he left the White House last year, was said by Mr. McCain's advisers to have offered advice in recent days to Mr. Schmidt and others on how to get Mr. McCain's campaign on track, but has stayed mostly on the periphery. Mr. Rove is aware, his associates said, that his own legacy could be helped should Mr. McCain win the presidency.
 Mr. McCain's advisers said that Mr. Davis would continue to hold the position of campaign manager, but that Mr. Schmidt had taken over every major operation where Mr. McCain has shown signs of struggling: communications, scheduling and basic political strategy. Mr. McCain's aides said that Mr. Davis would now focus more on longer-term campaign efforts, including helping with the selection of a running mate and planning for the Republican National Convention, which is now just two months away.
 Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Davis declined a request for comment. The McCain campaign played down the significance of this latest personnel shift.
 ''Voters don't care about the organizational chart of our campaign,'' said Jill Hazelbaker, the campaign spokesman, adding: ''Today's move is simply an expression of our understanding of the need to scale up for a general election campaign against Barack Obama.'' 
 Republican circles have been awash with rumors for weeks now that Mr. McCain would seek to bring Mike Murphy, a longtime friend and adviser who helped direct his 2000 campaign for the White House, back into the fold. Mr. McCain's advisers, noting the deep tensions between Mr. Murphy and many of the people in Mr. McCain's inner circle -- including Mr. Davis and Mr. Schmidt -- said such a development was highly unlikely.
 Similarly, Mr. McCain's aides said it was unlikely that John Weaver, another longtime McCain friend who left in the midst of the last shake-up, would return. ''Not enough bayonets to make me do this,'' Mr. Weaver said in an e-mail response to a question.
 The last shake-up occurred at the beginning of last July as Mr. McCain's campaign was bleeding money, riven by infighting, and the candidate was trailing in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. For all the negative commentary that shake-up drew to Mr. McCain, it had its desired result, a reminder that campaign upheavals are not necessarily a bad thing.
 In an early insight into the impact of Mr. Schmidt's new role, the campaign is planning what will amount to a restarting of Mr. McCain's candidacy after Independence Day, in which he will tour the country talking about a jobs program and visiting battleground states intended to illustrate the economic woes he will be talking about: Colorado, Wisconsin and Michigan. 
 By contrast, in appearances that drew widespread derision by Republicans -- and whoops of delight from Democrats -- Mr. McCain delivered a speech in which he came out in favor of off-shore drilling first before an audience of oil executives in Houston, and repeated it in a speech in Santa Barbara, Calif., a locale long identified with opposition to off-shore drilling.
 In abandoning Mr. Davis's idea to have the campaign largely run by 11 regional campaign managers, Mr. Schmidt told associates that he feared that system was unworkable and would lead to gridlock in the campaign. He is also about to hire a political director, a post that had gone unfilled under Mr. Davis.
 There were other signs that Republicans were trying to get back on track in the fight with Senator Obama. The Republican National Committee this week formed an independent expenditure committee to run advertisements on behalf of Mr. McCain. The committee bought time for advertisements this weekend in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, said Democrats who monitor the purchases.
 Charlie Black, one of Mr. McCain's senior advisers and an ally of Mr. Davis, described the changes as a retooling before the general election. Mr. Black said that Mr. Schmidt would be the chief operating officer of the campaign, serving under Mr. Davis, in charge mostly of helping Mr. McCain settle on a message and get it out with speeches, advertisements and surrogate events.
 ''He is going to be the chief choreographer,'' Mr. Black said of Mr. Schmidt.
 Yet by every appearance -- including the broad portfolio Mr. McCain has handed Mr. Schmidt -- it is clear that he is running the operation, Republicans involved in the campaign said.
 Mr. Schmidt, 37, is one of the most intense, hard-driving figures in his party today: when he worked for Mr. Bush, his nickname in the campaign was ''The Bullet,'' a reference to the shape of his shaved head. 
 He has been at the center of some of the most politically significant Republican operations of the last 10 years. In working with Mr. Rove and Ken Mehlman, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Mr. Schmidt has become immersed in the use of data-driven methods to find and turn out Republican voters.
 He also ran the Bush campaign's war room, which was responsible for capitalizing on mistakes of opponents. Mr. McCain's advisers said that one sign of Mr. Schmidt's increasing influence in the campaign's rapid response operation was the quickness with which it seized on a remark by Gen. Wesley K. Clark questioning whether Mr. McCain's experience as a naval aviator shot down over Vietnam had qualified him to be president.
 Mr. Schmidt ran the successful re-election campaign of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the California Republican who won in a Democratic state by embracing moderate positions on issues like the environment and gay rights.
 Mr. Schmidt also served as communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, a job that presumably offered him the kind of district-by-district political education that could prove helpful in making decisions about where to send Mr. McCain and what he should talk about.
 The shift comes after what even Mr. McCain's aides acknowledged has been a squandered period of time since he claimed the nomination in February. Mr. McCain spent Wednesday in Colombia, his second overseas trip in a week, and one that he took despite the urging of Republicans who said he needed to convey his concernsabout domestic problems to voters at home.
 ''Somebody asked, 'What's the strategy behind this?' '' Mr. Black said of the foreign travel. ''It's simple. McCain says he wants to go to these places, and we say, of course.''
 But, Mr. Black added, the trip should help to underline ''one of the big contrasts in this race: Obama wants to become the first protectionist president in our history since Herbert Hoover.''

HEADLINE: Shifting Stands: Is That Real Change?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Obama Agenda,'' by Paul Krugman (column, June 30):
 In recent weeks, progressive Democrats have been dismayed by Barack Obama's shifting policy stands on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the death penalty, gun control, and separation of church and state. 
 While some supporters justify the shifts as pragmatic politics to get elected, others voice doubts about his real commitment to change. 
 Mr. Obama has run a smart campaign based in part on his ability to accommodate competing policy stands. As president, he will have to make tough policy choices that will inevitably alienate some constituent or interest groups. He will not be able to please all the people all the time.
 I hope that if elected, Mr. Obama will stand up for poor and working Americans who did not benefit as much from the Reagan revolution as did the rich and powerful. Rosario Rivera 
 Cliffside Park, N.J., July 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman says that whether the Democrats can take advantage of this moment to change the country's direction is up to Senator Barack Obama. 
 I respectfully disagree. 
 As an independent voter and longtime political activist, I feel strongly that it is up to American voters, led by those of us who are most nonpartisan (independents), to be active in our democracy. 
 After November is when we must be even more involved in politics, to put pressure on our elected officials to do what's best for America, not what's best for the special interests (including the parties).
 Senator Obama has done a great service by inspiring and activating millions of Americans. Now we must stay active. Francine Miller
 Brooklyn, June 30, 2008
 The writer is on the steering committee of an association of independent voters.
 To the Editor:
 What a difference a month makes! Back at the beginning of June, when Hillary Rodham Clinton finally conceded the Democratic nomination, we were promised a different kind of presidential campaign and Democratic and Republican nominees who represented genuine change. 
 Less than a month later we have a campaign in which the Republican nominee lurches to the right and the Democratic nominee rushes to the center, both of them abandoning long-held positions. 
 That is the same script that has been followed in every previous presidential campaign since at least 1976. Where is the change? Why should voters be optimistic that this election and these nominees will be any different from the ones who went before? Chris Howell 
 Oberlin, Ohio, June 30, 2008
 The writer is a professor of politics at Oberlin College.
 To the Editor:
 In ''Obama's Money Class'' (column, July 1), David Brooks makes some predictions about a Barack Obama presidency. I am decidedly not frightened by them.
 Mr. Brooks suggests that Mr. Obama would be beholden to special interests, but the supporters he lists include doctors, lawyers, bankers, teachers, information workers -- virtually all professionals. I am not afraid of being governed by those who know how to do things.
 Mr. Brooks notes that many of these wealthy donors were indoctrinated at ''left-leaning universities.'' But these are intelligent people voting against economic self-interest. I am not afraid of being governed by people willing to pay out of their own pockets for good government.
 And he predicts that ''this highly educated class will have much more to say over policy.'' Good. It's about time we were governed by the educated.
 David Berman 
 New York, July 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks attempts to explain the preference of educated professionals for Democrats by positing a sort of rivalry between elites, pitting them against the corporate managerial class. 
 I propose a more straightforward and simple explanation: the blatantly anti-science, anti-intellectual and anti-common-sense attitude of the modern Republican Party. 
 How can a highly educated person with a knowledge-economy job be expected to support a party that in large part denies evolution and climate change? Jack Singal 
 Palo Alto, Calif., July 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks assumes that professionals get their values from ''competitive universities and the media world'' (both of which he assumes are liberal) and therefore tend to vote for and give to Democratic candidates. 
 It's just as likely that people with Democratic values tend to be attracted to the professions rather than to management. One of the fundamentals of Political Science 101 is that a strong predictor of an individual's political party affiliation is his or her parents' affiliation. Fay Sharit 
 Glen Rock, N.J., July 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Reading ''The Wrong Stuff,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, July 2), reminded me how much I would like this campaign to be dull. 
 Imagine a campaign during which all we heard were the possible solutions to the myriad problems now facing us, no name calling by the candidates or their advocates, no looking through the lens of the Vietnam War or the culture wars or rigid political ideology. 
 Wouldn't it be wonderful if reporters and pundits merely reported the candidates' ideas and approaches without attaching predigested labels like ''card-carrying liberal'' or ''neocon.'' 
 At this critical moment in our nation's history, no candidate is going to live up to our desperate need for a new approach and visionary leadership. Our problems are so intractable they will take years to solve. No one man or woman has that much intelligence, political savvy or sway. 
 What we really need is a renewed commitment to one another, to reason, to discipline and shared sacrifice. Our president is merely the one who will give voice and resonance to that commitment. Jane Nordli Jessep

HEADLINE: Politics Failed, But Fuel Prices Cut Congestion

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Reporting was contributed by Kathryn Carlson, Jason Grant, Nate Schweber and Mathew R. Warren.

 BODY:
Soaring gas prices and higher tolls seem to be doing for traffic in New York what Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ambitious congestion pricing was supposed to do: reducing the number of cars clogging the city's streets and pushing more people to use mass transit.
 In May, with gasoline at more than $4 a gallon, traffic at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's bridges and tunnels dropped 4.7 percent compared with the same month the previous year. 
 Preliminary data for June shows a similar decrease in traffic, and officials say the change is largely because of higher prices at the pump. 
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has recorded a similar decline in travel across its bridges and tunnels since early March, when it raised tolls. The greatest decline was in April, when traffic fell by 4.2 percent. (The transportation authority also increased tolls in March, but by a much smaller amount.) 
 At the same time, subway, bus and commuter rail ridership has increased. 
 Weekday subway ridership was up 6.5 percent in April, compared with the same month a year ago. April ridership increased 5.5 percent on the Long Island Rail Road, 4.3 percent on the Metro-North Railroad and almost 9 percent on PATH trains between Manhattan and New Jersey. Use of the subways and rail lines also increased in May, compared with the previous year, but in most cases by smaller amounts. New Jersey Transit ridership, including bus, commuter rail and light rail, was up about 4.6 percent in April and May combined. 
 ''We're at the point where people really are changing habits,'' said Sam Schwartz, a transportation consultant. He said that if gas prices stayed high, the result could be close to the goal set by Mr. Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan, which, if it had been approved, was expected to reduce traffic in much of Manhattan by 6.3 percent.
 ''If we start eclipsing $5 a gallon, which we might over the summer, I think we might get very close,'' Mr. Schwartz said. 
 Throughout the country, rising gas prices have had a broad economic impact, hitting especially hard in many cities and suburban communities where people are more dependent on cars than in the transit-dense New York City region. 
 And while there is no denying that increased costs mean a certain pain for drivers in New York, they may also have the unique effect of meshing with the city's goal of cutting traffic and, as a consequence, lowering pollution.
 Bloomberg administration officials, however, said the actual impact may be slight. 
 ''The magnitude here is by no means comparable to the effect that congestion pricing would have in reducing traffic,'' said Bruce Schaller, deputy transportation commissioner for planning and sustainability. 
 ''What congestion pricing does,'' he added, ''is it focuses traffic reduction on the most congested places and times, whereas gasoline prices spread the impact out.'' 
 Still, the new numbers do bolster a central point of the Bloomberg plan: that higher prices can motivate commuters to give up their cars. 
 ''It shows that pricing matters and that people respond to it,'' said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association. 
 It is hard to say exactly what the impact of lighter bridge and tunnel traffic has been on the streets of Manhattan -- or other boroughs -- since the city does not take traffic measurements that show changes from month to month. But there are other indications.
 The Metropolitan Parking Association, which represents garage and parking lot owners, said that its members had seen about a 10 percent decrease in daily customers. And gas station managers interviewed in Brooklyn, Queens and New Jersey said that the number of drivers buying gas had also declined. 
 Interviews with drivers and transit riders indicate, however, that a change in habits has not come easy -- and might be reversed if gas prices fall. 
 ''When prices went over $4, I stopped driving,'' said Scott Pisciotti, 41, a real estate portfolio manager from Somers, N.Y. Mr. Pisciotti said he used to drive daily to his office in Midtown Manhattan but now rides a Metro-North train from White Plains to Grand Central Terminal. It is a new routine for him, and he has not fully embraced it. ''If prices dropped,'' he said, ''I would drive a lot more.''
 Commuter trains have also become more crowded, riders say. 
 At the Secaucus Junction train station of New Jersey Transit, Brian Simmons, 30, said that it had become much harder to get a seat on the train in recent months. ''It's like the New York City subway,'' he said. 
 Gas price-induced traffic reduction might have a downside. Mr. Bloomberg's plan was intended, among other things, to raise hundreds of millions of dollars a year for mass transit improvements by charging cars an $8 fee to enter the area of Manhattan below 59th Street. The plan was defeated in April when legislative leaders in Albany refused to bring it up for a vote.
 In contrast, the current reduction in traffic at bridges and tunnels could actually take money away from transit, because a large portion of the tolls collected at the transportation authority's crossings helps to finance the subways, buses and commuter railroads. In May, toll revenues were more than $4 million below budget projections, and Gary J. Dellaverson, the authority's chief financial officer, said that June toll revenues appeared to be down even further. 
 So far, the drop has been more than offset by an increase in fare collections generated by higher transit and rail ridership, but Mr. Dellaverson said that the combination of slipping toll revenues and the increased cost of fuel for the authority's buses and trains could eventually outpace ridership revenue gains. 
 The rise in gas prices may also be increasing something that congestion pricing was meant to eliminate: the incentive for drivers to avoid tolls by using the free bridges over the East River, causing heavier traffic in the surrounding neighborhoods. 
 The congestion pricing plan called for a 6.3 percent reduction in the total miles traveled by all vehicles in the pay zone. That is different from simply taking cars off the street since some vehicles, like taxis, are responsible for a higher share of the total miles driven. Mr. Schaller said that to achieve the program's goal, the city would have needed at least a 10 percent reduction in the number of cars entering the zone.
 Mr. Schwartz estimated that a 4 or 5 percent drop at the bridges and tunnels might mean just a 2 or 3 percent reduction in Manhattan traffic. 
 While some drivers have given up and switched to trains or buses, those who are sticking with their cars say they are driving less. 
 Singh Bridgemohan, 50, was putting some gas, at $4.35 a gallon, in his red 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee on a recent morning at an Exxon station in Bay Terrace, Queens. Mr. Bridgemohan, who runs a small construction company, said he used to drive his wife, a nanny, from their home in Jamaica to her work in Bayside every day. Now he does it rarely, to save on gas, while she makes a much longer commute by bus. 
 At a Shell station on the New Jersey side of the Holland Tunnel, Peter Lin, 54, a sales executive from Holmdel, N.J., paid $56.18 to fill up his 2005 Toyota Camry before heading to work in Manhattan. Mr. Lin echoed several drivers who said that an unexpected benefit of higher driving costs was that there are simply fewer cars on the road.
 ''Do I like the traffic?'' he said. ''Yes. Do I like the cost of gas? Forget about it.''

HEADLINE: Aiming to Sell The World On Fitness

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: GAMBETTOLA, Italy 

 BODY:
Technogym, the world's second-largest maker of exercise equipment, has a strategy for fighting the declining dollar: promote exercise as a necessary luxury. 
 On the eve of the European Central Bank's expected increase in interest rates, a move likely to drive the value of the dollar still lower, Technogym is taking a page from the Italian fashion industry, focusing on reputation, cachet and flair, celebrating customers like Sylvester Stallone, Madonna and George Clooney.
 ''Fashion is looking good outside; wellness is feeling good inside. It's the new frontier of luxury,'' said Nerio Alessandri, the 46-year-old who owns and runs Technogym, second only in size to America-based Life Fitness, and exclusive supplier of 1,000 exercise machines on the grounds of the 2008 Olympics. 
 The United States is the world's biggest fitness market. But in case growth in the American market slows -- as it seems to be with every other consumer good and service -- Mr. Alessandri has expanded the company's reach in recent years to Dubai, Russia and China, countries where few people join health clubs and fewer still have home equipment. 
 In addition to mining such growth markets, Technogym's other strategy for surviving an American (or trans-Atlantic) downturn is containing costs. 
 Assembly lines are organized like an auto plant, with just-in-time supplies of components, digital message boards flashing the day's production target versus the actual production numbers, and slogans announcing ''Quality and reliability are our first objectives.'' 
 ''Because of the dollar, we spend an enormous amount of time on cost issues,'' said Timothy O'Connell, the company's marketing director.
 It is all part of one export-oriented company's effort to defy the challenge of a strong euro and weak dollar, and continue marketing aggressively to American customers. 
 But several American-based competitors say that the weak dollar is giving them an advantage. ''Our products always represent a great value to purchasers,'' said John E. Stransky, president of Life Fitness, a unit of Brunswick Corporation. ''A weaker dollar makes them an even more attractive purchase at this time.''
 Mr. Alessandri agrees that the weak dollar punishes Technogym, given that the dollar is the currency of the global fitness market, with the exception of Europe. ''The dollar penalizes us a lot,'' he said. ''It's also an opportunity, a stimulus to implement efficiencies.''
 Mr. Alessandri trained as an industrial designer, built his first fitness machine, for simulating weight lifting techniques, with the help of his younger brother, Pierluigi, in his father's garage when he was 22. Within 18 months, he had moved out of the garage to rooms on the grounds where the company headquarters now stands, in this hamlet of 10,000.
 Technogym is still very much a family company. Pierluigi, 41, is on the board and the brothers are the sole owners of the company, which now has 1,400 employees.
 One of two big European fitness machine makers, along with Precor, a unit of the Amer Sports Corporation of Finland, Technogym is arguably the leader in marketing fitness as a full service. Fitness services now generate 20 percent of the company's revenue and in five years will account for 40 percent, according to Mr. Alessandri.
 Partly because of the weak dollar, the company is losing contracts in America to competitors like Life Fitness. In response, Technogym has become a case study in globalization, tapping countries with newly rich residents eager to work out on sophisticated fitness machines.
 But Technogym cannot count on having a lock on its home market in Europe, either. For instance, Club Med, a leading chain of 22 fitness clubs in Paris, decided to broaden its selection of fitness machines beyond just Technogym equipment. As part of a three-year investment program in which Club Med, a division of the Club Med Vacation Village Group, spent about $4.4 million the first year, the chain agreed to outfit its luxury Waou Club Med Gym centers with Technogym, but to install Life Fitness in 17 mid-market Club Med Gym clubs.
 Yannick Francois, who is responsible for equipment at Club Med, said, ''Life Fitness machines are very robust, and we have 1,500 members, with 700 people coming through a day on average.'' Then he pointed to clusters of Technogym machines with their softly textured handles, integrated television screens, and digital keys that allow users to store data on their performance. 
 ''Technogym is haute couture,'' he said. ''In terms of design, comfort and ergonomics, it's the best.''
 Technogym places its workout machines the way Armani does its clothing, at the top of the market. Its newest offerings include a running machine with an integrated iPod that it developed with Apple; and a fitness machine for the elderly, complete with a red and green lights to tell users when to take a break. 
 Technogym is also working with hotel chains, like Mandarin Oriental and Starwood, and corporate customers like Deutsche Bank, Nike and Google, to provide them with top-of-the-line fitness centers for employees. A Kinesis model workout machine covered in hammered gold, for markets in Russia and Dubai, sells for $15,000. 
 ''Nerio has a passion for the industry,'' said Richard M. Caro Jr., president of Management Vision in New York, which follows the industry. ''He really believes in wellness.'' Technogym posted revenue of 485 million euros last year ($761 million), averaging growth in the last three years of 20 percent annually, selling machines and services. 
 Mr. Alessandri said that while fitness, including facilities like clubs and workout equipment, is a $17.6 billion industry in the United States, and $29.2 billion in Europe, it is virtually unknown in Asian countries like China and India. While 14 percent of Americans are health club members, the figure in Asia is about 4 percent, mostly in countries like Singapore and Japan. Technogym has had remarkable success in the United States, which now accounts for about 15 percent of revenue.
 ''Technogym's going to America was as if Starbucks came to Italy,'' Mr. O'Connell said. But Mr. Alessandri sees the greater potential in Asia, including Australia. 
 ''America is now in Asia,'' he said, ''not in America.''

HEADLINE: The Struggles of Detroit Ensnare Its Workers

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY. 
Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit, and Nick Bunkley from Fenton, Mo.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Their pickups and sport utility vehicles are not selling, and now General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler have to pay thousands of auto workers not to make them.
With more than 15 of their assembly plants across the country set to be idled or slowed because of shift cutbacks, the Detroit automakers will temporarily lay off upward of 25,000 auto workers this summer and fall.
Because of their union contracts, G.M., Ford and Chrysler are obligated to pay workers more than half of their regular take-home wages, plus health benefits, with state unemployment benefits picking up a portion of the rest.
Despite cutting more than 100,000 jobs since 2006 through buyouts and special retirement programs, the Detroit companies still cannot match their production capacity with their steadily declining market share. 
Consumers are shifting to more fuel-efficient vehicles, if they are stepping into a showroom at all. New vehicle sales plummeted 18 percent in June, and Detroit's share of the declining market fell to a combined 46 percent.
Moreover, all three companies are losing money in North America and burning through cash reserves. On Wednesday, G.M.'s stock fell 15 percent after a Merrill Lynch analyst issued a report saying that ''bankruptcy is not impossible'' if the overall market continues to deteriorate.
Unlike many factories operated by Japanese manufacturers in the United States, Detroit's plants are not flexible enough to switch their production to better-selling models.
So while some G.M. and Ford factories are scrambling to build more cars, even paying workers overtime to meet demand, other assembly lines are shutting down.
''It's an unprecedented situation,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Despite enormous reductions in total employment, the market is forcing massive temporary layoffs.''
Detroit's Big Three, it appears, can't escape their past.
Since the 1980s, the companies -- by dint of their contracts with the United Automobile Workers union -- have parked idled workers in so-called ''jobs banks'' where they received full pay while doing community service or simply clocking in.
New contracts with the U.A.W. signed last year were supposed to pave the way for elimination of the jobs banks and make the companies more competitive on health care and wages for new hires.
In addition, the historic buyout and early-retirement programs were meant to better align, at enormous expense, the automakers' workforce with demand for its vehicles. Even before this year, the companies had announced plans to close several plants.
But the restructuring plans did not account for the huge drop in sales and the shift by consumers to smaller vehicles that have resulted from soaring gas prices and the weak economy.
''You have the demand for large vehicles dropping, combined with growing demand but limited supply of smaller vehicles,'' said Jesse Toprak, executive director of industry analysis for Edmunds.com, an automotive-research Web site. ''What you end up with is miserable sales numbers.''
Rather than flood the market with unwanted trucks and S.U.V.'s, the Detroit automakers have announced broad, temporary layoffs on a scale unseen since the early 1990s.
''Instead of building vehicles and selling them at deep discounts, the companies are shutting the plants,'' said Ron Harbour, managing partner of the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which issues a widely followed annual report on auto manufacturing trends. ''It's painful, but it's smarter than the alternative.''
G.M. plans to send about 11,000 United States workers home on layoffs the rest of the year, some for weeks and others for months. It also has about 1,000 workers still on the rolls of jobs banks from plants long since closed.
Ford is idling about 5,000 of its hourly employees, in addition to the estimated 500 workers it has in the jobs bank. Chrysler, which has 300 people in the jobs bank, will lay off about 9,500 workers.
There are also layoffs scheduled at plants in Canada and Mexico.
Virtually all of the laid-off workers are at plants building slow-selling pickups like the Ford F-Series or big S.U.V.'s such as G.M.'s Chevrolet Suburban and Chrysler's Dodge Durango.
Some of those workers will, over time, be moved to car plants that are adding shifts or otherwise increasing production.
But the vast majority of the laid-off workers in the United States will stay at home and collect 95 percent of their average after-tax, take-home pay -- about $816 a week, according to U.A.W. documents posted on the union's Website.
Of that $816, the automaker pays about 55 percent and state unemployment covers the remainder. In G.M.'s case, the cost of supporting 11,000 laid-off workers averages about $1 million a day.
''It is a very expensive issue, but it's not the critical one for Detroit,'' said Mr. Shaiken. ''The reason these plants are going down is that some catastrophic decisions were made in the past to continue building so many trucks.''
The companies are trying to mitigate the impact of the production changes. Ford, for example, will cut a shift at its Missouri truck plant and almost immediately move the workers to a nearby factory making small S.U.V.'s.
At a Kentucky plant that makes Explorer sport utility vehicles, Ford will slash production from two shifts to one. But rather than lay off workers, the shifts will start to alternate work weeks.
Still, the Detroit automakers are hamstrung by the inability of their factories to shift production from slow-selling vehicles to hotter models. Rivals such as Honda can quickly move from making an S.U.V. such as the Element in its Ohio plant to Civic sedans.
''The key is they are able to change the mix of products to what is selling right now,'' said Mr. Harbour.
While plants operated by G.M., Ford and Chrysler have markedly improved their productivity and lowered their worker rolls in recent years, they generally are confined to making variations on a single truck or car platform.
The stunning drop in truck sales has forced the Detroit companies to make some hard decisions. Chrysler this week said it will close a minivan plant in Fenton, Mo., near St. Louis, and cut a shift at a neighboring factory that makes Ram pickups.
The double blow stunned workers. About 1,500 workers at the minivan plant will go on indefinite layoff in October, while 900 workers at the Ram factory will be idled in September.
''It's very scary,'' said Joe Wilson, a 40-year-old worker at the minivan plant. ''We'd been led to believe we'd have a future. Now they pull the rug out from under us.''
Mr. Wilson said that getting a paycheck for not working is hardly a relief when his job is disappearing. He was already cutting back on expenses, and had bought an old Ford Escort to save money on gas for his commute.
''It takes three weeks to get that first check and by then we owe everybody and their uncle,'' he said.
A worker at the Ram pickup plant, Dave Jacobs, said the plant's long-term prospects have been clouded by the reduction to one shift.
''They can't afford to run this place with one shift,'' he said. ''One shift pays the bills and the others are for profits.''
Laid-off workers can receive their unemployment pay for up to 48 weeks. At that time, workers can shift into the jobs bank for another two years.
But one Chrysler worker, Andy Marlow, said the cutbacks are coming so fast that employees fear the worst.
''You can sit and try to ride it out and hope the plant comes back up,'' said Mr. Marlow. ''But then if that pay runs out, you're unemployed.''

HEADLINE: When You Carry Precious Cargo on Your Back

BYLINE: By YISHANE LEE

 BODY:
HIKING with backpacking gear is a matter of balancing weight and necessity. Add a baby and the equation gets complicated. 
''You want a pack that will allow you to also pack in other items besides the child, or your hiking partner will get stuck with a very heavy load,'' said Tim Hauserman, the author of ''Monsters in the Woods: Backpacking With Children.''
The latest backpack carriers promise a greater variety of storage, including diaper bags. A few can now carry 60 to 70 pounds of baby and gear; older designs held only 40 to 45 pounds.
The weight of carriers has been reduced using technical fabrics over aluminum frames, and five-point safety harnesses are added.
Cole Kelly, the associate director of Camp Winadu in Pittsfield, Mass., took turns hiking in the Berkshires with his sons, Jack, 2 years old, and Luke, 10 months, in 4 new carriers. He also tested a more economical four-year-old carrier that has remained popular despite not having been updated.
All of the featured carriers adjust as children grow. For safety, babies should be at least 6 months old and able to hold up their heads.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: TOUGH TRAVELER BLUELUX STALLION: $245, www.toughtraveler.com. With roughly 1,000 cubic inches of storage, including a mesh diaper sleeve, this 4-pound 10-ounce pack has a 60-pound capacity. Mr. Kelly said the pack was ''one of the more comfortable'' of those tested. But Luke became fussy because the pack's high sides impeded his view. The carrier ''was better suited'' for older babies, he said.
SHERPANI RUMBA SS 08: $199, www.montkid.com. Mr. Kelly was ''impressed'' with this 7 1/2-pound carrier's 2,800 cubic inches of storage and 70-pound capacity. A sun/rain cover and detachable diaper bag are included. Using the ''easy to maneuver'' straps, he shifted the pack to his wife as Luke slept. A narrow strap between Luke's legs meant he ''moved around a lot,'' ''more annoying than unsafe.''
CHICCO SMART SUPPORT: $89.99, www.amazon.com. This 4-year-old carrier weighs 6 1/2 pounds but carries only 40 pounds. Still, it was a ''plus'' that it folds flat, was ''comfortable'' for the kids, and has an easy setup, Mr. Kelly said. The carrying straps had less padding than the others tested and storage was ''minimal,'' so he recommended the pack for short hikes of two miles or so.
KELTY FRAME CARRIER 3.0: $199.95, www.babycenter.com. Carrying up to 50 pounds, this 7 3/4-pound pack has 1,100 cubic inches of storage space and includes a removable sun/rain cover. Mr. Kelly said the comfy pack fit his toddler best. He praised the ''great'' accessories which made his ''life easier'' -- cup holders, a removable diaper bag and changing pad, and an attached mirror. ''Luke loved being able to play peekaboo,'' he said.
DEUTER KID COMFORT II: $189, www.rei.com. Mr. Kelly, above with his son Jack, 2, called this 6.1-pound pack, which now has lighter-weight fabric and a sturdier frame, ''the best of the bunch.'' It holds up to 48 1/2 pounds
 its 1,000 cubic inches of storage space was ''more than adequate.'' He said it ''was the easiest for me to put Luke in and take him out.'' Most others required ''wrangling.'' (PHOTOGRAPHS BY RICK FRIEDMAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: Price of Oil Rises Again, Rattling The Markets

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Vikas Bajaj in New York contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- A sharp increase in oil prices on Wednesday sent shudders through anxious financial markets already worried about the prospect of a global economic slowdown.
Crude oil climbed above $144 a barrel before settling at $143.57, up $2.60 for the day. The Energy Department reported an unexpected decline in inventories, sending oil prices to a record. And now oil slowly is closing in on $150 a barrel, the next psychological milestone to be crossed.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.8 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 166.75 points, or 1.5 percent, and is now down nearly 21 percent from its peak in October. A 20 percent drop in major stock indexes is considered the start of a bear market.
Shares in energy, materials and industrial companies led the market down. Analysts said the rapid rise in commodity prices had become a problem for both users and producers of raw materials and energy. Since reaching a new high on May 20, energy stocks in the S.& P. 500 have fallen 5 percent as crude oil futures have shot up 11 percent. 
Recent data on industrial activity and driving habits suggest that higher prices are damping demand for commodities, especially energy, and slowing down the global economy. Shares of General Motors fell 15 percent, to their lowest level since 1954, after an analyst at Merrill Lynch said a bankruptcy filing by the automaker was ''not impossible.''
Shares of Nucor, a steel maker, fell more than 14 percent as investors worried about weakening demand.
''As the energy price spikes higher, it's crimping global growth further,'' said Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Citigroup. ''It's starting to be a real challenge for global economies.''
The automotive group AAA reported that the average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline on Wednesday rose to $4.09, a half-cent higher than the day before, almost 12 cents higher than a month ago, and $1.14 above the price of a year ago. The single largest component in the price of a gallon of gasoline is the price of crude oil.
It almost seems like ancient history since a single trader, apparently looking for bragging rights, bid up the price of crude over $100 by buying a small lot on Jan. 2 and then immediately selling it at a small loss. Political unrest, a cold winter and declining oil inventories were singled out as culprits for the jump past $100.
Since then, the prices of oil and gasoline have just kept rising. Over the last three months, the average retail price of unleaded regular gasoline was $3.75 a gallon, nearly 65 cents higher than the average price in the first quarter of the year, according to the Oil Price Information Service. The research group has estimated that Americans are now spending $1.6 billion a day on gasoline, which would make July the first month ever when the American gasoline bill would top $50 billion.
Tom Kloza, the group's chief oil analyst, predicted that a barrel of oil would reach $155 by August and that retail prices for gasoline would rise to $4.25 to $4.50 a gallon for unleaded regular.
''The firecrackers are going off in the oil market and it will burn the U.S. consumers this holiday weekend,'' Mr. Kloza said. He added that truckers stood to suffer most, noting that diesel prices rose 13 cents a gallon Wednesday afternoon in response to the Energy Department report.
''Diesel is the bullet with the most acceleration at the moment,'' he said. '' You are going to see a lot of bankruptcies in the trucking business.''
Pushing up the price of crude are any number of factors, including continued instability in Nigeria, a partial strike at Venezuela's state oil company and reports that Israel is considering an attack on Iran. Yet another reason for oil's price climb came with the Energy Department's weekly statistical bulletin, which showed that crude oil stocks had slipped by nearly 2 million barrels to below 300 million barrels.
Analysts say that level is psychologically important because crude oil stocks as recently as last year were above 350 million barrels. The inventory level was the lowest since January, and below what most analysts had expected. The crude oil inventory figure was 54 million barrels below a year ago, and nearly 22 million barrels below the five-year average, according to tabulations by Barclays Capital.
There was also some modestly good news in the report. Gasoline inventories rose 2.1 million barrels to 210.9 million barrels, an indication that gasoline demand is slackening a bit as drivers car-pool, buy more efficient cars, and use more mass transit when it is available.
But while the Energy Department report showed refineries increasing operations a bit, several experts cautioned that gasoline inventories traditionally come down in July and August. This year should be no different, they said, since refineries are having trouble making a profit on gasoline because gasoline prices have not kept pace with oil prices.
Weak profits in the refining business is one reason that energy stocks have been taking a beating, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor's Equity Research. Shares in oil refining and marketing companies in the S.& P. 500-stock index are down more than 47 percent for the year.
In response to the rising cost of oil and gradually falling gasoline demand, refiners have been cutting their production rates for months.
''With the weakness in refinery margins, refiners have had no incentive to build crude oil inventories,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an energy analyst at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, a group backed by the oil industry. ''In fact, they have been liquidating crude oil inventories. It means that the system is running on a tight basis.''
That tightness means higher gasoline prices even as the national demand for oil is easing for the first time in nearly two decades. The Department of Energy reports that gasoline demand for the week that ended June 27 was down 2.1 percent from the same week a year ago. In comparison, demand for distillate fuels, which include heating oil and diesel, was up nearly 7 percent.
''Supply is struggling to grow worldwide and the feeling is prices have to rise to choke off demand growth,'' said Aaron F. Brady, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm affiliated with IHS Inc. ''I don't see any barriers,'' he added, to further price rises.
The sentiment for ever higher oil prices was summed up in a headline on a daily energy note written on Wednesday by Chris Ruppel, an energy analyst with Execution, an institutional brokerage firm: ''Oil: $300 on the Radar Screen.''
Mr. Ruppel says he thinks the $300 price -- what he calls ''Iran war insurance'' -- is unlikely. But he said that investors bought nearly 2,000 call option contracts on June 27, permitting them to buy Nymex crude at $300 a barrel for December delivery.
''Those buying these options may want to trust Iranian assurances, but without verification they need the insurance,'' Mr. Ruppel wrote.

HEADLINE: Economic Problems in Britain Mimic Those in U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
A housing market in shambles, inflation at the highest level in years and signs that the economy is headed for, or already in, recession. Sound familiar?
 The British economy, like its counterpart across the Atlantic, has fallen on hard times, and in many ways the experience appears to be mirroring that in the United States. Indeed, the run in September on a British mortgage lender, Northern Rock, was one event that helped to embed the term ''credit crisis'' firmly into the global consciousness. 
 ''A recession is more likely than not by the end of the year,'' Peter Newland, who covers the British economy for Lehman Brothers, said Thursday, summarizing a string of dismal data that have led economists to revise their growth forecasts downward. ''Activity seems to be declining across the economy,'' he said. 
 The FTSE 100, the benchmark London stock index, has fallen about 18.5 percent from the high of 6,732.4 that it hit in June 2007 -- just short of the 20 percent decline that is commonly said to define a bear market. It gained 50.3 points, or 0.93 percent, to close at 5,476.9 on Thursday.
 Consumer confidence is the lowest since 1990, as oil prices drive toward $150 a barrel and unemployment has risen for the last four months. 
 In a written statement to a parliamentary committee Wednesday, Charlie Bean, deputy governor of the central bank, called the current situation ''the most challenging set of circumstances since at least the early 1990s and possibly earlier.'' 
 The main force dragging down the British economy is the collapse of the once red-hot housing market, which enriched many British residents as long as credit flowed nearly as cheaply as in the United States.
 According to Nationwide Building Society, a leading British mortgage lender, housing prices have fallen for eight consecutive months. In June, prices fell 6.3 percent from a year earlier, the biggest drop since 1992, taking a ''typical'' home down to $:172,415, or about $343,000 -- a decline of more than $:13,500 from the top of the market. 
 The British central bank said Monday that mortgage approvals in May were at the weakest level on record -- only 42,000 for all of Britain, down from 58,000 in April.
 As the housing market sputters, consumers have retrenched. Shares in Marks & Spencer, the British retailer regarded as a bellwether of the domestic economy, plunged more than 25 percent in two days after it reported a sharp decline in sales. On Wednesday, Marks & Spencer said a consumer slowdown led to its biggest drop since 2005. 
 Gordon Brown, the beleaguered prime minister, sought to look on the bright side, while acknowledging that the remarkable run of prosperity over the previous decade or so has hit a wall.
 ''The task at the moment is to keep the economy moving forward,'' he said Thursday, speaking to a parliamentary committee in London. He expressed confidence that the economy was ''far more resilient than it was facing the last two oil shocks and facing some of the problems we had when there was a world downturn in the early 90s.'' 
 But that seems little consolation. Unions are agitating for higher wages, even as inflation rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate in May, above the 3 percent upper limit of the Bank of England's comfort zone. 
 Despite the growing distress of British workers and businesses, economists hold out little hope of monetary policy relief. Economists surveyed this week by Reuters were unanimous in predicting that Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, and his colleagues on the Monetary Policy Committee would hold rates unchanged at their meeting next Thursday. Only 23 of the poll of 72 economists surveyed this week forecast lower rates by year-end, down from 41 of 62 a few weeks ago.
 ''Wherever you look at the moment, the data are pretty worrying,'' Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight in London, said. ''It's a terribly difficult position for the Bank of England.'' The central bank's main interest rate target, at 5 percent, is already the highest among G-7 countries.
 Economists said the economy was lagging slightly behind the American business cycle. The Federal Reserve has moved aggressively, cutting its main rate target to 2 percent from 5.25 percent last summer, and Congress moved quickly to enable 130 million households to receive tax rebate checks as part of a $168 billion stimulus program. 
 In contrast, the British government has little leeway to spend its way out of any slump. The public purse is constrained by two rules -- the so-called ''golden rule,'' in which the government borrows only to invest and not to finance current spending, and the sustainable investment rule, in which public sector debt is to be held stable at ''a stable and prudent level.'' 
 Mr. Archer estimated that the British economy would grow 1.4 percent in 2008, sharply slowing from 3.6 percent growth in 2007, and contract by 0.9 percent in 2009. The euro zone will probably grow 1.6 percent this year, down from 2.6 percent growth last year, and expand by 1.2 percent next year, he said. 
 Mr. Newland, the Lehman economist, predicted that the Bank of England would probably feel comfortable reducing rates by a quarter point in November, and by 1.25 points more next year. ''Oil prices are the big uncertainty,'' he said. ''If oil prices don't fall, growth will be much weaker and rates will stay much higher for longer.''

HEADLINE: BREAKING GROUND; Karina Bay Resort & Marina

BYLINE: By NICK KAYE

 BODY:
WHAT Waterfront fractional-ownership development.
 WHERE Key Largo in Florida. 
 AMENITIES A private beach and access to a fleet of boats, among others.
 PRICES Shares of residences start at $200,000. 
 STATUS Scheduled to open around the beginning of next year.
 DEVELOPERS Karina and Reinhard Schaupp.
 CONTACT (866) 952-7462 or www.karinabay.com.
 DETAILS A few years ago south Florida was at the center of the real estate boom. Developers lined up to erect beachfront towers, pushing the bounds of South Beach as far north as possible, and hotel chains swooped in to get a piece of the vacation-home action. And while the bursting of the bubble has reverberated all around, there are still new, smaller-scale projects for those looking to invest in a getaway. One such development is the Karina Bay Resort & Marina, about 50 miles south of Miami, close to where the Overseas Highway meets Key Largo. The four-acre site has long been occupied by the motel-style Gilbert's Resort, which for the past 10 years has been owned by a German couple, Karina and Reinhard Schaupp. Now the Schaupps are remaking the resort into a fractional-ownership community. The motel building will be torn down to make room for 16 two-bedroom duplex town houses and three free-standing, two-bedroom villas. The residences, which come furnished and feature private balconies with small, infinity-style pools, are all sold in one-10th shares that will grant owners five weeks of use a year. A pool, a restaurant and a bar with live entertainment already at the resort are being renovated, and a fitness center will be added. The 38-slip deep-water marina will be open to owners with their own boats, and for others there will be 10 boats available to use. The Miami airport is about an hour's drive away.NICK KAYE Breaking Ground is a weekly look at projects, planned or under construction, that include weekend or vacation homes.

HEADLINE: Penn National Gaming Cancels Its Sale to Private Equity Firms

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Another big corporate buyout fell apart Thursday, as Penn National Gaming announced that it had terminated its $6.1 billion sale to two private equity firms.
 The casino operator would have received $67 a share in cash from Fortress Investment Group and Centerbridge Partners. Now, Penn National will receive $1.475 billion, including both a $225 million breakup fee and a $1.25 billion equity investment by the two firms, due in 2015 and payable with cash or stock.
 Penn National said that renegotiating the deal at a lower deal price was ''not a viable option.'' Shares of Penn National closed up about 3.7 percent on Thursday at $29.66. 
 The buyout was one of the last from the deal-making boom that ended last summer. But its fate became increasingly tenuous amid the tighter credit markets, which have helped derail several other proposed private equity deals.
 The Penn National deal had been identified by some analysts as a potential candidate for renegotiation. Since the deal was announced last June, Penn National's stock price has remained below the deal price of $67 a share.
 ''This was not the result we expected when we entered into our agreement one year ago,'' Peter M. Carlino, Penn National's chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call, adding that Thursday's deal was ''not a perfect substitute'' for the just-collapsed deal. Mr. Carlino also noted that he and his family hold a large stake in the company.
 Like many private equity deals that have foundered over the past year, the Penn National takeover grew uncertain as the company and buyers bickered with banks over the lenders' financing commitments. But several weeks ago, the parties began exploring ways to avoid the messy lawsuits now plaguing other failed buyouts, like those for Huntsman and Bell Canada, according to a person briefed on the matter.
 Under the new terms of the Penn National arrangement, the buyers' two banks, Deutsche Bank and Wachovia, were released from their previous lending commitments, and in return agreed to provide about $550 million of the $1.475 billion payment to Penn National, this person said. 
 The new arrangement will leave Penn National with far less debt than it would have borne after the proposed buyout. The company plans to use proceeds from the new deal to pay down about $610 million of outstanding debt in its revolving line of credit, as well as future expansion opportunities. It also plans to buy back up to $200 million of the company's stock over the next two years. 
 The company said it expects second-quarter net revenues of $621.8 million, less than the $656 million average estimate of analysts surveyed by ThomsonReuters. It expects to pull in about $2.5 billion in net revenues for the year.
 Penn National has 19 gambling operations in 15 jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Missouri, but none in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, the country's two largest casino markets.
 Struck during the frothy heights of the buyout boom last June, the Penn National deal was part of a string of takeovers in the gambling sector. Aztar, which owns the Tropicana casino in Atlantic City, was sold to Columbia Sussex after a long and fierce bidding war.
 But the economic slump and the drop in consumer spending have left many questioning the financial health of casinos. Aztar, now known as Tropicana Entertainment, filed for bankruptcy protection in April after a string of financial and regulatory problems.

HEADLINE: In a Bright Side to the Slowdown, Shopping Bargains Abound

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Anyone who has managed to forget about fuel prices long enough to enjoy a little retail therapy knows some steep discounts are available these days.
 ''I've noticed there is a ton of stuff on sale,'' said Barbara Friedman, who was shopping on Thursday with a friend, Evelyn Hatfield, at Lord & Taylor in Midtown Manhattan. They were marveling at discounts as high as 50 percent in stores they had visited.
 Retailers deny that the gloomy economic landscape has prompted them to offer deeper and earlier discounts this summer than in previous years. But industry analysts and those who study marketing and consumer behavior say the stores have an incentive to pretend nothing is amiss, even as they post eye-popping sale signs. 
 ''The sales are very aggressive,'' said Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst at the NPD Group. ''They're trying to lure whatever dollar is available as quickly as they can get it.''
 With consumer confidence at a 16-year low, retailers are clearly under pressure. A truer picture of the retailer situation should emerge next week when the big chains report sales numbers for June. 
 For now, Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation, a trade group, acknowledges only that sales to unload summer gear and make way for fall merchandise are ''creeping up a little earlier'' than in the past.
 ''It's so early,'' said Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist in San Francisco who has been noticing a proliferation of sales throughout department and specialty stores. ''They keep an eye on each other. This year they're in a panic to make sure they're the first one.''
 Rarely have consumers been this tight. Personal savings as a percentage of disposable personal income jumped to 5 percent in May, up from 0.4 percent in April. 
 If shoppers splurge it will most likely be on only one item this summer, Ms. Yarrow said, rather than three or four.
 Half of the inventory at Ann Taylor Loft is on sale, and shoppers can take an additional 20 percent off their entire purchase. Merchandise is up to 50 percent off at J. Crew, Banana Republic, Old Navy and the Body Shop. 
 At Macy's, Ben Sherman men's dress shirts were $59.99, marked down from $89.50. At Bergdorf Goodman this week, a swingy Chloe sundress was $625, down from $1,275. A black ruffled-hem Dolce & Gabbana dress was $711, down from $1,450.
 J. C. Penney's ''lowest prices of the summer'' sale ended before the first Fourth of July fireworks started. Customers buying one towel or T-shirt could get a second for 88 cents. A new sale, celebrating Independence Day, has just begun.
 ''Zara is having a great sale,'' said Stephanie Kinlock, 25, as she walked down Fifth Avenue. ''The whole store is on sale.'' Ms. Kinlock, who was carrying a Macy's bag, said the deals this summer seemed better than last year. She had been shopping for a dress in Macy's with her sister, Camille, 27. 
 ''I came to help but I ended up buying,'' she said.
 David Wyss, chief economist at Standard and Poor's, said many retailers are still hoping to grab a share of consumers' tax rebate checks by offering tempting promotions. The last wave of checks will be mailed no later than next week. In May, retailers selling anything other than fuel or food barely saw an uptick from the checks, though electronics were an exception.
 ''That's because when the average guy opens an $800 rebate check it looks a lot like a large-screen television set,'' Mr. Wyss said.
 When June sales at stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales and a barometer of retail health, are announced next week, analysts expect the results to be spotty, though certainly not all gloom and doom. They think pent-up demand, warm weather and the flurry of promotions will give a boost to some stores, even if it only means their negative sales figures are less negative.
 Ken Perkins, the founder of Retail Metrics, a research group, said analysts expect a 2 percent increase in June sales. He characterized that as modest given the stimulus package and estimated an increase closer to 3 percent. ''Nothing stellar but not too bad,'' he said, ''and sort of buoyed by the rebate.''
 Kimberly Greenberger, an analyst with Citigroup, said she expects June same-store sales to improve by 2 to 3 percent over her May figure, which was negative 3. Many retailers now have better control over their inventories, she said, and rising temperatures mean that shorts and tank tops are no longer lingering on shelves. 
 Mr. Cohen of the NPD Group said the segments likely to fare the worst are women's fashion and high-end footwear. Faring better will be parts of the home sector, he said, because people are sprucing up their homes rather than buying new ones. 
 Sales of video games and toys should do well, he said, as parents do without so their children will not have to. 
 As for rebate checks, even if they do nudge sales up, analysts say the effect will not be long-lasting.
 Lynn Franco, director of the Consumer Research Center at the Conference Board, a business membership and research organization, said the current environment reminds her of rebate checks the government handed out in 2001. ''It had this one-quarter impact,'' she said. ''And there was a sort of retrenchment in spending.''
 Of course that applies only to Americans. International shoppers are spending. 
 ''We've seen a lot of Italians. A lot of Spaniards,'' Ms. Hatfield, of Tulsa, said in Lord & Taylor. ''Which of course says a lot about our dollar.'' A falling dollar makes American goods cheaper for foreigners. 
 In Gucci, Ms. Friedman phoned her husband to tell him how overseas shoppers were buying several-thousand-dollar bags ''like they're giving it away.'' 
 As Ms. Yarrow, the consumer psychologist, put it: ''We're the bargain-basement headquarters of the world.''

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK EXTRA; High-Water Mark

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
High-Water Mark
 On July 3, 2007, just as New York's financial elite were packing up early and heading to summer haunts in the Hamptons, Blackstone announced a $26 billion buyout of Hilton Hotels. The credit markets had already begun to fray at that point, and after Hilton, the parade of huge private equity deals came to a halt. Remarkably, Blackstone found enough financing to take Hilton private, even as the credit squeeze locked up the leveraged loan market. By October, the deal was done. 
 Blackstone offered a 25 percent premium to Hilton's all-time high stock price, valuing the hotel chain at around $20 billion, not including debt. Blackstone put up $5.17 billion of its own capital.
 So how is Blackstone faring with Hilton, one year later?
 Tough question. It is hard to know what the company would fetch today on the open market, and Hilton has stopped reporting quarterly financials. 
 Some factors have clearly changed for the worse. The real estate market in general has clearly deteriorated in the past year. High fuel prices and a shaky economy are hurting the travel industry. That could mean that people are less likely to stay at a premium hotel, if they are feeling flush enough to take a vacation at all.
 That has certainly been a problem for other hotel chains that are still publicly traded. Stock in Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, a Hilton competitor that was often rumored to be a buyout target as well, has fallen 45 percent in the past year.

HEADLINE: London Swings as a Dynamo for Selling Art

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The transformation of London, a sleepy backwater for two decades, into an art capital that rivals New York has never been more apparent than in this past fortnight of auctions, with record prices fetched for works by artists ranging from Monet to Francis Bacon. 
 The weak dollar has made London an attractive place for Americans to sell. This city has also gained cachet as the stomping ground for rich denizens of the former Soviet Union, like the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich or the Ukrainian steel magnate Victor Pinchuk, both serious art collectors. 
 ''Fourteen of the top Impressionist and Modern works of art were sold to collectors from the former Soviet Union,'' Marc Porter, president of Christie's in America, said of the London sales. That figure represents nearly a quarter of the private buyers, he added. 
 Russian and Middle Eastern tastes are still a matter of guesswork for auction experts. Among the paintings or sculptures thought to have been bought by collectors from the former Soviet Union were ''Dancer'' (1915), a colorful Italian Futurist canvas by Gino Severini that sold for a record $29.6 million at Sotheby's, and a 1948 Giacometti bronze in the same auction that brought $18.5 million. Both prices topped the house's high estimate and both works were purchased anonymously. 
 So large have the sales become that they are now spread over two weeks rather than one. 
 These sales now attract collectors and dealers worldwide. Night after night they piled into the salesrooms to watch the art market defy doomsayers. Economic worries in the United States and Europe seemed irrelevant. If a work ranked as a treasure, bidding was intense. 
 The record prices weren't the only surprise. For nearly a decade now tastes have gravitated toward Modern and contemporary works. But this time an Impressionist painting -- one of the rarest examples of Monet's beloved waterlilies series -- brought a staggering $80.4 million at Christie's, becoming the season's top seller. 
 ''It re-establishes a certain equilibrium,'' said James Roundell, a London dealer. 
 The Monet, sold by the heirs J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller, had hung in their Eero Saarinen-designed home in Columbus, Ind., for 15 years. It was considered a now-or-never purchase; such a painting is unlikely ever to come on the market again. 
 The winning bidder, seated in the front row, was Tania Buckrell Pos, a Canadian-born art adviser in London. She refused to identify the buyer. (Her Web site, artsandmanagement.com, says she organized an exhibition in Dubai in 2006, suggesting perhaps a Middle Eastern buyer.) 
 The second most expensive offering at Christie's that night was another Impressionist work, the Degas pastel ''Dancers at the Bar'' (around 1880), which was sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for $26.5 million. 
 Auction house officials were tight-lipped about the buyers of the Monet and Degas works, but there was speculation that Brett Gorvy, a co-head of Christie's postwar and contemporary art department who submitted the bid, was acting for a Russian, possibly Mr. Abramovich. 
 Mystery, after all, is always part of the allure of auctions. Aside from the secret buyers, there are fiercely private sellers. And auction houses strike dozens of confidential deals with their clients over the division of the spoils, making it impossible to gauge a sale's true profitability. Although Sotheby's is a public company and releases quarterly financial reports, it is not always clear in the short term whether high prices mean big profits.
 For example Christie's sale of Jeff Koons's mammoth sculpture ''Balloon Flower (Magenta)'' was a costly undertaking. Money had to be spent on advertising, printing a special catalog and insuring and shipping the piece from Dallas to London via Germany. The sculpture was so big that Christie's installed it outdoors in St. James's Square, which required stationing security guards there around the clock. 
 Add in the guarantee, an undisclosed sum promised to the sellers, in this case Howard and Cindy Rachofsky, that was said to be around $25 million, and one wonders how Christie's could profit despite the record-breaking $25.7 million price. 
 ''Balloon Flower (Magenta)'' is considered one of Mr. Koons's best-loved sculptures, a crucial consideration. The moment something was deemed second rate or too expensive in this auction round, it failed to sell. ''The difference between good and great is 1,000 percent,'' said Tobias Meyer, worldwide head of Sotheby's contemporary art department. ''If a work is overhyped or not good enough, nobody is interested.'' 
 That was apparent in the week's first postwar and contemporary auction on Sunday, Phillips de Pury & Company's ''late afternoon, evening sale.'' That house's majestic new headquarters in an 1894 building here attracted major players, but few raised a paddle. Its offerings were weak compared with those at Sotheby's and Christie's, and 30 percent of them failed to sell. 
 Prices bounced back the next two nights at Sotheby's and Christie's, when two paintings by Francis Bacon, one at each house, emerged as this week's top sellers. Collectors of postwar and contemporary art have traditionally been overwhelmingly American. That held true at Christie's, where Mr. Porter said that Americans accounted for half the buyers. Sotheby's offered more works (several Yves Klein pieces for example) that tend to appeal to Europeans, who accounted for 49 percent of that sale's buyers, including Russians. (Americans made up 39 percent of the buyers.) 
 In the end even the pros were reeling from the prices. ''Sellers should be happy,'' said Thomas Gibson, a London dealer. ''I just hope the buyers will be as well in two years' time.''

HEADLINE: The World Is Finite, With Finite Resources

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 In ''A Terrible Bust Is Born'' (column, June 30), Roger Cohen chronicles many important problems with the United States and the global economy related to increasing commodity prices. 
 But he doesn't mention the underlying cause of our situation. Metaphoric phrases, like ''the world is no longer flat, it's upside-down,'' don't provide an adequate explanation. The basic cause is the literal fact that the world is finite. 
 There is only a finite amount of usable resources. I stress usable, because as we use up the most readily available of our resources, it requires more of our other resources just to find, extract, process and distribute what's left. 
 Matter and energy cannot be destroyed, but the ability to extract useful work from them is destroyed by each of us in our everyday lives. We are fortunate to be alive on a world with such diversity of natural resources. Let the recent increase of most commodity prices be a wake-up call that the world is finite.
 William Culver Washington, June 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''A Terrible Bust Is Born'' is worth keeping and remembering. Thanks to Roger Cohen for his perceptive and pertinent insight into the coming bear market. And thanks for the optimism at the end of his column.

HEADLINE: The Westin Verasa Napa Residences

BYLINE: By NICK KAYE

 BODY:
The Westin Verasa Napa Residences
 WHAT A wine country condominium-hotel.
 WHERE Napa, Calif.
 AMENITIES A well-known restaurant and a swimming pool, among others. 
 PRICES Residences start at around $450,000.
 STATUS Planned to open this fall. 
 DEVELOPER Intrawest Placemaking. 
 CONTACT (800) 509-8090 or www.verasanapa.com.
 DETAILS Wineries around the country have started adding residences in recent years, often in unexpected places like Virginia and Georgia. But it's hard to compete with northern California's wine country, with its prestige and sheer number of vineyards. This project, the fifth partnership between Westin Hotels & Resorts and Intrawest, the resort developer based in Vancouver, is near the center of downtown Napa. It consists of a Craftsman-style building with 180 studio, one- and two-bedroom suites sold in whole ownership. Owners will be able to place their units in a rental program to serve as hotel rooms when they are away, and they will receive a portion of the rental revenue. One of its wings will open onto the Napa River, and there will be a pool courtyard with a whirlpool. The chef Ken Frank is moving his popular La Toque restaurant there from nearby Rutherford. Concierges will be on hand to assist with reservations for wine tastings, spa visits and meals away from the development, and additional features include a fitness center and access to paths along the river. The Sacramento, Oakland and San Francisco airports are all within a fairly short drive.
 Karina Bay Resort & Marina
 WHAT Waterfront fractional-ownership development.
 WHERE Key Largo in Florida. 
 AMENITIES A private beach and access to a fleet of boats, among others.
 PRICES Shares of residences start at $200,000.
 STATUS Scheduled to open around the beginning of next year.
 DEVELOPERS Karina and Reinhard Schaupp.
 CONTACT (866) 952-7462 or www.karinabay.com.
 DETAILS A few years ago south Florida was at the center of the real estate boom. Developers lined up to erect beachfront towers, pushing the bounds of South Beach as far north as possible, and hotel chains swooped in to get a piece of the vacation-home action. And while the bursting of the bubble has reverberated all around, there are still new, smaller-scale projects for those looking to invest in a getaway. One such development is the Karina Bay Resort & Marina, about 50 miles south of Miami, close to where the Overseas Highway meets Key Largo. The four-acre site has long been occupied by the motel-style Gilbert's Resort, which for the past 10 years has been owned by a German couple, Karina and Reinhard Schaupp. Now the Schaupps are remaking the resort into a fractional-ownership community. The motel building will be torn down to make room for 16 two-bedroom duplex town houses and three free-standing, two-bedroom villas. The residences, which come furnished and feature private balconies with small, infinity-style pools, are all sold in one-10th shares that will grant owners five weeks of use a year. A pool, a restaurant and a bar with live entertainment already at the resort are being renovated, and a fitness center will be added. The 38-slip deep-water marina will be open to owners with their own boats, and for others there will be 10 boats available to use. The Miami airport is about an hour's drive away.
 Breaking Ground is a weekly look at projects, planned or under construction, that include weekend or vacation homes.

HEADLINE: India Curbs Corn and Steel Exports

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
India banned corn exports and curbed shipments of steel, seeking to increase domestic supplies and cool the fastest inflation in 13 years as world commodity prices soar. India's corn ban adds to curbs on exports of rice, wheat and cooking oil as the government seeks to tame price increases that have driven interest rates to a six-year high. The nation increased corn shipments more than sixfold in the last year as the global price doubled. Shipments from India totaled a record 2.5 million tons in the year that ended June 30 as feed makers in Southeast Asia sought cheaper alternatives to supplies from the United States. Exports were 400,000 tons in the previous year.

LENGTH: 847 words

HEADLINE: Land of the Meek, and Home of the Deeply Blue

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
It is tempting to overpraise ''Kabluey,'' a bittersweet indie comedy whose hapless protagonist, Salman (Scott Prendergast), spends a good part of the movie waddling along the side of a highway in a blue foam-rubber suit. Dressed as Kabluey, the corporate mascot of BlueNexion, a failing Internet company in Texas, Salman is paid $6 an hour to attract attention. 
 As motorists stop to gawk at this featureless blob with a giant round head, Salman's job is to distribute fliers advertising office space in BlueNexion's sleek, nearly deserted headquarters. Because he can't hold the fliers in his inflated paws, Salman has to keep them tucked under one arm, from which they are continually slipping and scattering onto the road. 
 To be trapped all day inside this costume with the sun beating down on him may be hell. But as enraptured children cling to Kabluey as if he were a cartoon legend sprung to life, Salman finds an odd kind of transcendence in the work. He becomes two people: one a lost 32-year-old boy cowering inside the suit, the other the adorable, bobbing and shuffling Kabluey who inspires cuddly affection. 
 Midway through the movie Salman meets another professional buffoon, a man outfitted as a giant Gouda cheese who dispenses tidbits in front of a supermarket. Together the two, fully costumed, eventually engage BlueNexion's sleazy, womanizing chief executive (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in a slapstick brawl. 
 Mr. Prendergast, an alumnus of the Groundlings comedy troupe, wrote and directed ''Kabluey,'' which is very funny in a ghastly way. All the characters -- be they the gossipy, backbiting Austin, Tex., equivalents of television's desperate housewives or Salman's morose fellow passengers on the bus to work -- suffer from excruciating boredom. It is a malaise that rises like steam from the flat, Middle Western landscape in which the corporation's emptied offices symbolize an economy going bust. 
 Salman is the nerdy brother-in-law of Leslie (Lisa Kudrow), an overstressed mother bringing up two hellions, Cameron (Cameron Wofford) and Lincoln (Landon Henninger), while her husband, a National Guardsman, fights in Iraq. When informed that her husband's tour has been extended by several months, Leslie visibly crumples. No one is better than Ms. Kudrow at playing emotionally bedraggled women hanging on by their fingernails, and your heart goes out to her, even when she behaves atrociously. 
 Enlisting Salman as a live-in baby sitter is the solution of last resort for Leslie, who is forced to take a job at BlueNexion to pay for her children's health insurance. Salman, unemployed and homeless after losing his last job as a laminater in a copy shop, nervously accepts the invitation. In the recent epidemic of comedies about 30-something men in the throes of severe arrested development, he is one of the most pitifully incompetent losers.
 Cameron and Lincoln hate Salman on sight. ''I'm going to kill you,'' hisses Cameron, the older and meaner of the two. And their pranks, like sprinkling cleanser on Salman's eyes and mouth while he is asleep and putting thumbtacks in his breakfast cereal, show they mean business. 
 Salman takes the harassment in stride. He leads the rampaging little monsters on leashes to the supermarket and ties them up outside the store like dogs.
 If Salman suggests an Adam Sandler character, Mr. Prendergast plays him like a long-suffering Buster Keaton stumblebum; he is so far beyond misery he is practically mute. Mr. Prendergast gives him the wide vacant eyes of a silent clown who is so resigned to a life of humiliation that his face has lost any expression, save for his mouth, which gapes in an attitude of befuddled amazement. 
 The plot of ''Kabluey,'' which operates on surreal cartoon logic, doesn't bear close scrutiny. There are holes everywhere. When Salman gets the job as Kabluey, which Leslie finds for him, the crisis that brought him into the family is nearly forgotten. Who is caring for the boys? Toward the end the movie takes a queasy turn toward the saccharine. 
 The film's distance from factual reality oddly enhances its bleak underlying vision. It portrays a demoralized American work force fearfully going through the motions of life while waiting without much hope for things to get better. 
 ''Kabluey'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.
 KABLUEY

HEADLINE: Service Sector Data Adds to Inflation Anxiety

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The United States service sector shrank unexpectedly in June, according to a closely watched survey released on Thursday, while inflation pressures soared to a record high for the survey's 11-year history. 
 The Institute for Supply Management's measure of employment in the vital service sector hit a record low, which could fan fears of a return to low growth and high inflation, known as stagflation, that was last seen in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
 The data also points up the quandary facing the Federal Reserve, which cut benchmark interest rates to support the weak economy at the risk of adding to price pressures. It is now expected to keep rates steady while waiting to see if inflation becomes a bigger problem.
 The institute's nonmanufacturing index was down to 48.2 for June, from 51.7 in May. A reading below 50 signals contraction.
 ''The nonmanufacturing results were decisively weak in a survey that typically does not show decisive movements,'' said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York.
 Economists had expected a reading of 51.0, according to the median of 76 forecasts in a poll by Reuters.
 The service sector represents about 80 percent of American economic activity, including businesses like banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants.
 On Tuesday, the institute released results of another survey that showed manufacturing expanded in June for the first time in five months, helped by a weak dollar. That report also showed that inflation pressures soared to their highest since the stagflation-ravaged 1970s.
 If there was any good news for the Fed, it was the suggestion that price rises in the service sector were not being passed on to consumers completely.
 ''Yes, prices are higher, but it's not a total pass-through to the end consumer,'' said Anthony S. Nieves, chairman of the institute's nonmanufacturing business survey committee. ''It's more about eroding profit margins.''

HEADLINE: The Empire of Excess

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
Starbucks wants to get back to its roots to help turn around its ailing fortunes. It brought back the pioneering chief executive Howard Schultz to run the coffee chain day to day, and it has introduced a new blend, Pike Place Roast, that harks back to the location of its first Seattle store. 
 Yet for all the new marketing efforts, Starbucks's biggest mistakes and greatest challenges boil down to three words: location, location and location.
 This week, in an announcement that surprised even analysts who have grown accustomed to bad news from Starbucks, the company said it would shutter 600 ''underperforming stores,'' and significantly scale back plans to open new outlets. 
 The bitter economy is hurting countless retailers and restaurant chains. But the prospect of Starbucks closing stores, rather than opening them, is different. The company has long been known in the world of commercial real estate for its expertise at selecting prime locations and its fearlessness in establishing almost comic ubiquity in some neighborhoods. 
 Starbucks would not comment for this article. But it appears that the company strayed from the exacting real estate science that it had perfected and guided it through its first expansion wave.
 Though the flagging economy and soaring gas prices are responsible for at least some of Starbucks's woes, interviews with commercial real estate brokers nationwide who work with the chain suggest another aspect of the story. These people say that the company was so determined to meet its growth promises to Wall Street that it relaxed its standards for selecting new store locations.
 In some cases, brokers say, Starbucks misjudged the risks of putting stores close to each other, leading to the decline in same-store sales that the company started reporting for the first time in its history this year. 
 It also overextended itself in certain regions, like in the South and in Southern California, which are among the hardest hit by the housing crisis, and whose older demographics and hot weather are not generally conducive to creating long lines of customers eager to pay $4 for foam-top lattes.
 ''The economy exposed all the flaws in their thinking,'' said one commercial real estate broker, who, like some others interviewed for this article, did not want to be named in order to preserve his relationship with the company.
 That ''flaws'' and ''Starbucks'' are even in the same sentence when it comes to commercial real estate is a reversal for the company. For much of the last 15 years, Starbucks commercial real estate executives were known for their rigor in selecting locations.
 In evaluating locations, Starbucks looked past commonly used community demographic information to analyze nitty-gritty specifics, like the education level in various neighborhoods. It also studied traffic flow on both sides of each street, to make sure drivers could make an easy right turn for their java fix on their way to the office.
 ''Starbucks rewrote the book on expansion and how to grow multiple store units, really in the world,'' said Craig Sweitzer, founder of Urban Works Real Estate in Portland, Ore., who has worked with Starbucks for 18 years. ''No one had ever done that before, and now everyone copies them.''
 The potential rewards of rapid growth may have led Starbucks astray.
 In 2004, the company announced it would double its pace of expansion, with a goal of reaching 15,000 stores in the United States. (It currently operates about 7,000 stores nationally.) That ambitious target was clearly a major culprit in Starbucks's misfortune: the company said this week that 70 percent of the stores marked for closing were opened after 2006.
 Matt Dougherty of Nevada Commercial, which represents Starbucks in Las Vegas, said that the damaging effects of these growth plans were most apparent at the end of each fiscal year, when the company would accelerate store openings to meet the new store goals it had set with Wall Street.
 ''There was a little bit of a frenzy to get locations open,'' Mr. Dougherty said. ''The opportunity was there but the real estate wasn't as good as we would have liked.''
 In one recent instance, Starbucks opened a new Las Vegas store with a drive-thru within a mile of an older, successful store with no drive-thru. It was typical Starbucks bravado: dismiss concerns about cannibalization to soak up excess demand and stay ahead of the public's seemingly limitless craving for caffeine.
 But Mr. Dougherty said customers did not change their habits and continued to frequent the old store. ''Afterwards, when the new store wasn't doing so well, we discussed how that probably wasn't a location we would have approved six months ago,'' he said.
 Brokers in Florida, another state Starbucks chose for rapid expansion, saw similar trends. Internally, the company was discussing reaching 1,000 stores in the state by the end of the decade, according to two brokers in the state. To get there, it doubled its average number of annual openings. As a result, selection standards for new locations dropped.
 ''We pumped it up, we accelerated, but when you do that you sacrifice real estate,'' said one Florida broker, who did not want to be named. ''There was a disconnect somewhere in Seattle between those decisions and what the reality was on the ground. The opportunity was not always there.''
 Another problem, according to analysts and brokers, was that many of the newer stores were in areas of potential but unrealized population growth. The housing crisis derailed much of that planned development, in many cases putting the company in the position of waiting for new traffic patterns that never materialized.
 ''Some of those areas have not panned out as they originally thought because of what has happened economically'' said Sharon Zackfia, an analyst at William Blair & Company.
 Many analysts also want to see Starbucks slow the growth of its licensed stores, which appear in bookstores and supermarkets and which can siphon traffic from more profitable company-owned locations.
 For example, David Palmer, an analyst who covers the company for UBS Equity Research, said that near his home in Westbury, N.Y., there is a company-owned Starbucks within a hundred yards of a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble, which in turn is within a few hundred yards of a Starbucks inside a Stop & Shop supermarket. 
 ''We just wonder if shareholders are getting a good deal from that,'' Mr. Palmer said.
 At the company, there is tacit admission that despite the bad economic conditions that could easily be held accountable, the company had gotten away from its early real estate magic.
 When Mr. Schultz returned as chief executive in January, one of his first moves was to bring back Arthur Rubinfeld, who led the company's expansion from 1992 to 2002 and who helped create many of the real estate techniques for which Starbucks is known.
 ''They are trying to bring back the old leadership that did everything right,'' Mr. Sweitzer said.

HEADLINE: Copying Issue Raises Hurdle For Bush Pick

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Michael E. O'Neill helped steer the Supreme Court nominations of John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr. through the confirmation process. An expert on judicial nominations, Mr. O'Neill later spoke with pride to a legal magazine about helping place ''some difficult federal judicial nominees'' onto the lower federal courts.
 The shoe is now on the other foot. President Bush nominated Mr. O'Neill to be a judge on the Federal District Court here last month, and there are signs that his nomination might be a difficult one as well.
 Last year, a peer-reviewed legal journal, the Supreme Court Economic Review, issued a retraction of an article by Mr. O'Neill in 2004. ''Substantial portions'' of the article, the editors wrote, were ''appropriated without attribution'' from a book review by another law professor. In addition, at least four articles by Mr. O'Neill in other publications contain passages that appear to have been lifted from other scholars' works without quotation marks or attribution. 
 Long passages in the 2004 article are virtually identical to the book review, which was published in 2000 in the Virginia Law Review and was written by Anne C. Dailey, a law professor at the University of Connecticut.
 For instance, Professor Dailey wrote: ''Bounded rationality is not a refutation of the rational actor model; to the contrary, it attempts to fine-tune the model to take account of predictable cognitive limitations and biases. Despite occasional references to irrationality in the literature, there is nothing in fact irrational about bounded rationality.''
 Four years later, Mr. O'Neill wrote this, without quotation marks or attribution to Professor Dailey: ''Bounded rationality is not a refutation of the rational actor model; to the contrary, it seeks to recalibrate the neoclassical model to take account of predictable cognitive limitations and biases. Despite occasional references to irrationality in the literature, there is nothing especially irrational about bounded rationality.''
 In an interview on Thursday in the dining room of his home in Chevy Chase, Md., Mr. O'Neill was contrite about the duplications, blaming ''a poor work method.'' He said he often mingled research materials and his own work in a single computer file. ''I didn't keep appropriate track of things,'' he said. ''I frankly did a poor and negligent job.''
 Mr. O'Neill, a boyish 46-year-old who wore jeans and a wrinkled blue button-down shirt, said he had never knowingly passed off other scholars' statements as his own. ''So much of it is sort of dry and straightforward stuff,'' he said. ''To me, it all sounds generic and plain. I didn't catch it.''
 Deborah L. Rhode, an authority on legal ethics at Stanford, said the retraction by the Supreme Court Economic Review was ''extremely unusual'' and amounted to ''a textbook case of conduct that casts doubt on someone's fitness for judicial office.''
 ''That's a serious form of misconduct in an academic career,'' Ms. Rhode said. ''I would think it would be viewed equally seriously in a judicial career. In my judgment, that would be disqualifying.''
 In an interview, Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee until last year, said he had known for some time about the questions concerning Mr. O'Neill's scholarship. 
 ''I heard him out on it and put it in the balance of everything else I knew about him,'' Mr. Specter said. ''I believe he is an excellent prospect for the district court.''
 ''He was my chief counsel and staff director at a very difficult time,'' Mr. Specter continued, referring to the nominations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, the withdrawn Supreme Court nomination of Harriet E. Miers and a host of legal issues, including civil rights, bankruptcy and asbestos litigation. 
 Mr. Specter said Mr. O'Neill's nomination ''has been thoroughly vetted on a number of levels,'' including by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the White House. ''I was told it went to the president,'' he said.
 Emily A. Lawrimore, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. O'Neill had been ''completely forthcoming'' from the start of the vetting process and had ''expressed remorse for his actions.''
 ''He was highly recommended to President Bush,'' Ms. Lawrimore said of Mr. O'Neill, ''and the president is confident he will make an excellent judge.'' 
 Friends and colleagues describe Mr. O'Neill as a creative, fair and exceptionally able lawyer. He is a graduate of Brigham Young University and Yale Law School, and he served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court and Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He is working on a master's degree in writing fiction.
 The flawed 2004 article was not an isolated incident. Passages in the other articles by Mr. O'Neill, now an associate professor at George Mason University School of Law, also bear striking similarities to other scholars' work.
 Shown a copy of a 2000 article by Mr. O'Neill in the Brigham Young University Law Review, Gerald M. Caplan, a former Justice Department official and former dean of the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, said it included a verbatim reproduction of a passage from a 1985 article he wrote in the Vanderbilt Law Review. Mr. O'Neill did not quote or cite Professor Caplan.
 ''Well, he's got me word for word,'' Professor Caplan said. 
 ''And there is some evidence that it's not innocent or inadvertent,'' he added, referring to the nature and extent of the duplication. 
 ''It shows him to disadvantage,'' Professor Caplan said. ''If I were on the Judiciary Committee, I would want to know more.''
 Similarly, parts of a 2000 article by Mr. O'Neill in the George Mason Law Review bear a striking similarity to a 1997 article in the Michigan Law Review by Neal Kumar Katyal. 
 Professor Katyal, of the Georgetown University Law Center, said he knew Mr. O'Neill and admired him.
 ''Mike is an innovative thinker and has always had integrity in my many dealings with him,'' Professor Katyal said. ''I can't imagine that he would intentionally copy this banal point from my article.''
 Daniel D. Polsby, an editor of the Supreme Court Economic Review and the dean of the George Mason School of Law, said he had learned about the similarities to the book review in a letter from its author, Professor Dailey. (Professor Dailey declined to comment.)
 ''It was my opinion at the time that this was negligent behavior,'' Dean Polsby said, ''and he was duly chastised. The idea of O'Neill committing a theft is just impossible. It's just impossible.''
 But the law school and Mr. O'Neill agreed that the lack of attribution in the article would have serious consequences for him as a law professor. ''By agreement, by a handshake,'' Dean Polsby said, ''he stepped away from tenure and will reapply for it.''
 Mr. O'Neill said the law school's investigation concluded that his conduct had not been willful.
 ''The range of possible sanctions was a hug and a cookie to firing you,'' he said. ''They felt like it was a significant mistake on my part. They didn't think it was intentional.''
 Asked how he would have viewed a judicial nominee like himself in his old job on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. O'Neill answered elliptically.
 ''I've tried to have a decent reputation with people,'' he said. ''It's certainly my fault. You'd like to be not just defined by the mistakes that you make in life.''

 JAPAN HOPES TO TAKE LEAD
 In Conservation Efforts
 After the energy crises of the 1970s, Japan forced itself to conserve with government-mandated energy-efficiency targets and steep taxes on petroleum. Now, with oil prices hitting dizzying levels and the world struggling to deal with global warming, it is hoping to use its conservation record to take a rare leadership role on a pressing international issue.

 STUDY FINDS SLOWER ICE MOVEMENT
 A Dutch study using 17 years of satellite measurements suggests that the movement of Greenland's ice sheet toward the ocean, a process that raises sea levels, is not as rapid as has been feared. The acceleration appears to be a transient summer phenomenon, the researchers report, with the overall yearly movement actually dropping slightly in some places. PAGE A8 
 9 ARRESTED IN TERRORISM RAID
 The Indonesian police arrested nine terrorism suspects after a raid on Wednesday in the Sumatran port city of Palembang by an elite Indonesian counterterrorism team that officials said turned up more than a dozen homemade bombs and a cache of ammunition. A police spokesman refused to give further details, but Indonesian media quoted an antiterrorism official as saying that the men were planning an attack on Westerners in Jakarta. PAGE A6
 CHINA AGREES TO MORE TIBET TALKS
 China agreed to hold another round of discussions with envoys of the Dalai Lama before the end of the year ''if the Dalai Lama made positive moves,'' but officials declined to say if the two sides had made any progress. The outcome of this week's talks has taken on international significance in the aftermath of the riots in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, and parts of western China in March. PAGE A11
 U.S. EMBASSY TO OPEN
 Former President George Bush is expected to open the new United States Embassy in Berlin on Friday, the most American of holidays (though perhaps not in Germany). The ceremony will mark the end of nearly four years of construction and more than a decade of contention, including but not limited to architectural criticism. PAGE A8
 U.S. URGES SANCTIONS ON ZIMBABWE
 Seeking to force President Robert Mugabe into negotiations with the opposition, the United States formally proposed United Nations Security Council sanctions on Zimbabwe. A vote is expected as early as next week, and although passage is not assured, the United States has apparently mustered enough support to garner the nine of fifteen votes needed to approve the resolution.

 TARGET: BARACK OBAMA
 Strategy: What Day Is It?
 Despite a three-month head start, Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has struggled to solidify lines of attack against Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, for the general election. Republican operatives and some of his own advisers acknowledge that Mr. McCain has run into problems that bedeviled Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's primary campaign against Mr. Obama. PAGE A14
 MCCAIN'S TRIP ACROSS THE BORDER
 Senator John McCain used a visit to Mexico to appeal to residents of both sides of the border: Mexicans and, more urgently, their voting relatives and other Latinos in the United States. ''We must secure our borders and then we will address the issue of comprehensive immigration reform,'' Mr. McCain said at a news conference. His campaign feels the trip could resonate among voters back home by promoting his support of free trade, while highlighting his immigration views. PAGE A14
 NEW ARRESTS AFTER RAID IN PLANT
 Two supervisors at a kosher meatpacking plant in Iowa where hundreds of illegal immigrants were rounded up in May were arrested on criminal immigration charges. Also, an arrest warrant was issued to a third man described by workers as the plant manager. Unions and immigrant advocacy groups had criticized immigration officials for focusing arrests on workers while taking no action against top managers. PAGE A12
 SNEAKING PEEKS AT PASSPORT FILES
 A report by the inspector general of the State Department, released in part, found that employees might have improperly peeked into the passport files of wealthy people and celebrities far more often than previously believed. The inquiry was started after an internal audit earlier this year showing that the files of three senators who were presidential candidates -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, John McCain and Barack Obama -- had been viewed by employees for no authorized purpose.

 RULING AGAINST FLORIDA GOVERNOR
 The Florida Supreme Court ruled that Gov. Charlie Crist, above, overstepped his authority when he negotiated a deal last year that let the Seminole Tribe of Florida install slot machines and offer table games like blackjack and baccarat at its Florida casinos. Despite the ruling, a spokesman for the Seminole Tribe said there were no immediate plans to stop the games while legal options were explored. PAGE A13

 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS

 Lampposts up and down the Avenue of the Americas were once festooned with round signs showing the national seals of all the nations in the Western Hemisphere. But almost all are gone now, taken down in the early 1990s when many of the lampposts along the avenue were replaced, and the few that remain are faded and streaked with rust stains. PAGE C9 
 FASHION NIGHT FOR 'UNTOUCHABLES'
 In India they are known as Dalits, or ''untouchables,'' women with such a low social standing that they are below the lowest rung of the officially banned but still-present caste system. They cleaned septic systems for a living. But on Wednesday evening, 17 were models in a fashion show at the United Nations, with 20 or so others in the audience. PAGE C9

He lost the other one when a rocket-propelled grenade smashed through his Humvee in Iraq almost four years ago. PAGE C11
 JAGR ERA ENDS FOR RANGERS
 The Jaromir Jagr era ended for the Rangers when the team decided not to wait any longer for a decision from Jagr, their mercurial captain, and signed Vancouver forward Markus Naslund to a two-year, $8 million contract. The Rangers also signed Buffalo defenseman Dmitri Kalinin to a one-year deal, completing a major makeover of the team. Rangers General Manager Glen Sather said Jagr never responded to the team's inquiries about what it would take to keep him in New York. PAGE C13

 Joe Buck, Fox's No. 1 baseball and N.F.L. announcer, was in damage control mode after an interview on Wednesday in which he said that he ''barely'' watched sports when he was not working and that he preferred ''The Bachelorette'' on ABC. It was all a joke, he said. PAGE C12

 EUROPE RAISES BENCHMARK RATE
 In Effort to Curb Inflation
 The European Central Bank raised its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent, making good on a promise last month that it would act to curb soaring food and fuel prices. The decision widens the gulf in monetary policy between Europe and the United States, where the Federal Reserve, with interest rates half those in Europe, has so far not raised them. PAGE C1
 BAD LOCATION, BAD LOCATION, ETC.
 Starbucks has long been famous in the world of commercial real estate for its expertise at selecting prime locations. But it announced this week that it would close 600 ''underperforming stores'' and scale back plans to open new outlets, and some brokers say one reason is that the company was so determined to meet its growth promises that it relaxed its standards for selecting new locations.

 NO REASON. JUST A SALE.
 Retailers -- with the notable exception of those selling gasoline -- are offering some steep discounts these days.

 RUSSIA PRESSURES U.S. BANK
 In Moscow, the Russian government sought to make Bank of New York Mellon liable under United States racketeering laws for $22.5 billion in damages arising from a money laundering scandal that helped undermine the Russian economy in the late 1990s. The suit is part of a long effort to enforce civil liabilities against the bank.

 DESPAIR, WAR AND DEBAUCHERY,

 An opera of complexities both emotional and technical, ''Die Soldaten,'' at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan, is a story of post-world-war despair and a young woman whose first steps of descent happen at the hands of soldiers. It is an epic debut for the Armory as a performance space, with a moving stage and rows of chairs for the audience, and a work that was ''billed as unplayable all these years'' by the conductor, Daniel J.

HEADLINE: Rove's Third Term

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
Al Gore never claimed that he invented the Internet. Howard Dean didn't scream. Hillary Clinton didn't say she was staying in the race because Barack Obama might be assassinated. And Wesley Clark didn't impugn John McCain's military service.
 Scott McClellan, the former White House press secretary, titled his tell-all memoir ''What Happened.'' But a true account of modern American politics should be titled ''What Didn't Happen.'' Again and again we've had media firestorms over supposedly revealing incidents that never actually took place. 
 The latest fake scandal fit the usual pattern as an awkwardly phrased remark, lifted out of context and willfully misinterpreted, exploded across the airwaves. 
 What General Clark actually said was that Mr. McCain's war service, though heroic, didn't necessarily constitute a qualification for the presidency. It was a blunt but truthful remark, and not at all outrageous -- especially given the fact that General Clark is himself a bona fide war hero.
 Yet the Clark affair did reveal something important -- not about General Clark, but about Mr. McCain. Now we know what a McCain administration would represent: namely, a third term for Karl Rove.
 It was predictable that the McCain campaign would go wild over the Clark remarks. Mr. McCain's run for the White House has always been based on persona rather than policy: he doesn't have ideas that voters agree with, but he does have an inspiring life story -- which, contrary to the myth of the modest maverick, he talks about all the time. The suggestion that this life story isn't relevant to his quest for office was bound to provoke a violent reaction.
 But the McCain campaign went beyond condemning General Clark's remarks; it went out of its way to distort them. ''This backhanded slap against John as not being a worthy warrior because he just got shot down is one of the more surprising insults in my military history,'' said retired Col. Bud Day, who participated in a conference call organized by the campaign. In fact, General Clark had said no such thing.
 The irony, not lost on Democrats, is that Col. Day himself has done what he falsely accused Wesley Clark of doing: he appeared in the 2004 Swift boat ads that impugned John Kerry's wartime service.
 The willingness of the McCain campaign to engage in these tactics, employing such tainted spokesmen, tells us that the campaign has decided to go negative -- specifically, to apply the strategy Karl Rove used so effectively in 2002 and 2004 (but not so effectively in 2006), that of portraying Democrats as unpatriotic. 
 And sure enough, Adam Nagourney of The New York Times reports signs of the ''increasing influence of veterans of Mr. Rove's shop in the McCain operation.''
 Will Rovian tactics work this year?
 In 2002 and 2004, Republicans were so successful at playing the patriotism card thanks to a combination of compliant media and cowering Democrats. At first, the Clark affair suggested that nothing has changed. News organizations reported as fact the false assertion that General Clark criticized Mr. McCain's military service, and the Obama campaign rushed to ''reject'' his remarks.
 ''Two days into the Wesley Clark fallout,'' wrote the Columbia Journalism Review on Tuesday morning, ''the press, the G.O.P., and the Obama campaign all seem to have agreed that Clark's recent remarks on John McCain's service record were at best impolitic and at worst despicable.''
 Since then, however, both the press and the Obama campaign seem to have recovered some of their balance. Opinion pieces have started to appear pointing out that General Clark didn't say what he's accused of saying. Mr. Obama has also declared that General Clark doesn't owe Mr. McCain an apology for his ''inartful'' remarks and denies that his own condemnation, in a speech given on Monday, of those who ''devalue'' military service was aimed at the general.
 In the end, the Clark affair may have strengthened the Obama campaign. Last week, with his cave-in on wiretapping, Mr. Obama was showing disturbing signs of falling into the usual Democratic cringe on national security. This may have been the week he rediscovered the virtues of standing tall.
 Furthermore, my sense, though it's hard to prove, is that the press is feeling a bit ashamed about the way it piled on General Clark. If so, news organizations may think twice before buying into the next fake scandal.
 If so, the campaign has just taken a major turn in Mr. Obama's favor. After all, if this campaign isn't dominated by faux outrage over fake scandals, it will have to be about things that really did happen, like a failed economic policy and a disastrous war -- both of which Mr. McCain promises will continue if he wins.

HEADLINE: Russia Presses U.S. Bank Over Money Laundering

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Sara Rhodin contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The Russian government sought Thursday to make Bank of New York Mellon liable under United States racketeering laws for $22.5 billion in damages arising from a money laundering scandal that helped undermine the Russian economy in the late 1990s. 
 The appearance of a team of pastel-clad trial lawyers from Miami, representing Russia, capped a long effort to enforce civil liabilities here against the bank, which reached a settlement with the United States government in the case in 2005. 
 As Russia's economy collapsed in the late 1990s, capital flight was one of the contributing causes. And at that time, about $7.5 billion was improperly transferred out of the country through Bank of New York accounts to a shell company owned by the husband of a bank employee, Lucy Edwards. 
 Both Ms. Edwards and her husband were later sentenced to five years of probation, and the bank, which admitted lax oversight, agreed to pay $14 million to the United States. 
 In a novel legal theory on choice of law, the lawyers -- working on a contingency fee for the Russian Customs Committee -- are seeking to apply the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, known as RICO, against the bank in a Russian court. The bank argues that the statute of limitations for new legal suits against it has expired. 
 One of the lawyers for Russia, Steven C. Marks of the Podhurst Orseck law firm, argued that a new lawsuit was valid because the bank's 2005 settlement qualified as a criminal admission of guilt, making it liable for civil damages. 
 The case, being heard at Basmany Court in Moscow, has attracted the attention of prominent legal experts. Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor, prepared an affidavit in support of the Russian plaintiffs, and a former United States attorney general, Dick Thornburgh, prepared one on behalf of the bank. 
 On Thursday, the court heard testimony from experts on whether it had jurisdiction to decide American criminal law, and whether the RICO statute could be applied outside of the United States. 
 ''I believe very strongly that in a time of globalization of banking and globalization of money laundering, it would be a terrible tragedy if RICO laws were confined to the United States border,'' Mr. Dershowitz said in a telephone interview. 
 But Mr. Thornburgh said no foreign court should hear cases under the RICO statute, a 1970s law aimed at fighting organized crime that allows civil penalties for certain criminal acts. ''Only U.S. courts can adjudicate RICO,'' he said in an interview in Moscow. 
 Bank of New York Mellon also contends that the improper wire transfers did not amount to a precursor crime under RICO, and that Russia's claim to damages was not supported by evidence. 
 The bank says the Basmany Court's decision will never be upheld outside of Russia. The same court heard the politically tinged bankruptcy case against the Yukos oil company, which ended in dismantlement of the company and was criticized for what some saw as judicial irregularities. 
 Still, Mr. Dershowitz, arguing for the Russian customs agency, said the Bank of New York should observe the court's ruling. ''A great bank founded by Alexander Hamilton will not want to be perceived as running away from judgment,'' he said. The plaintiffs are arguing that the widespread harm caused to Russian people by the collapse of the Russian ruble should be considered in the damage calculation. 
 In many other legal cases, officials in Russia and other countries have objected to applying American law to disputes outside of the United States. 
 The practice has drawn objections in several widely publicized cases, including Exxon Mobil's dispute with Venezuela and Cuban exile suits against the island's Communist government. In the Venezuela case, Exxon sued in United States, British and Dutch courts. 
 Courts around the world, however, routinely apply other countries' laws in contract disputes. 
 Bruce Marks, a Philadelphia lawyer who filed RICO claims against an aluminum conglomerate controlled by the Russian billionaire Oleg V. Deripaska, testified in court Thursday for the customs agency. Mr. Marks said that the American racketeering law could be applied in a foreign court, though no foreign court had yet passed judgment on such a case. 
 At one point, with the spires of Moscow's skyline outside the courthouse window, Mr. Marks was drawn into a discussion of United States Supreme Court precedent on the question of whether civil damages could be sought under the RICO law even if the defendant had not been convicted of a criminal offense. He said it could, telling Judge Lyudmila Pulova that Sedima v. Imrex clarified that point. 
 In that case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1989, the court ruled that a fraudulent scheme, even one that is part of a legitimate company's ''regular way of doing business,'' can establish proof of a racketeering violation. 
 Steven Marks, the lead plaintiff's lawyer, who is not related to Bruce Marks, specializes in airline crash cases that fall under international law. He had also represented the governments of several South American countries seeking damages from American tobacco companies. 
 In Russia, Steven Marks was authorized to seek damages on the cigarette claims with a 29 percent contingency fee. That agreement, with the Russian customs committee, was later extended to the Bank of New York case. 
 Mr. Marks says his payment terms are not material to the case. He said the lawyers would seek to use the Russian court's judgment to garnish Bank of New York reserves at central banks in some of the 90 or so countries where the bank does business. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 22, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on July 4 about a suit based on American racketeering law that was brought in Russia against Bank of New York Mellon referred incorrectly to a United States Supreme Court decision relevant to the law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. In the case of Sedima v. Imrex, which was cited by a lawyer for a Russian government agency, the court ruled that to establish proof of racketeering, the offenses must be related to one another and must demonstrate continuity. The court did not rule in that case that a single fraudulent scheme, even one that is part of a legitimate business's ''regular way of doing business,'' could establish proof of a racketeering violation. (That determination was made by the Supreme Court in a later case, H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.)

HEADLINE: Obama Fuels Pullout Debate With Remarks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama said Thursday that he might ''refine'' his policies for Iraq after meeting with military commanders there later this summer. But hours later he held a second news conference to emphasize his commitment to the withdrawal of all combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of taking office.
His two statements in Fargo, N.D., reflected how the changing dynamics in Iraq have posed a challenge for Mr. Obama, who is trying to retain flexibility as violence declines there without abandoning a central promise of his campaign: that if elected, he would end the war.
His remarks came as Republicans -- including his all-but-certain opponent this fall, Senator John McCain of Arizona -- have been arguing that Mr. Obama would most likely change his position on the phased withdrawal. They suggest that with violence dropping in Iraq, bringing the troops home would risk erasing the fragile gains that have been made. 
Mr. Obama said at his first news conference on Thursday that he planned a ''thorough assessment'' of his Iraq policy when he visited that country this summer.
''I've always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability,'' he said. ''That assessment has not changed. And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground, I'm sure I'll have more information and will continue to refine my policies.''
Mr. Obama has long spoken of consulting with commanders in the field as part of his plan for a phased withdrawal, but his shift in emphasis in the way he spoke about the situation on Thursday -- after weeks in which Republicans and even an outside Iraq policy adviser to his campaign argued against a withdrawal along the lines he had proposed -- fueled speculation that he might not be wedded to his timetable.
So the Obama campaign scheduled a second news conference to try to clarify his remarks. ''We're going to try this again,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Apparently, I wasn't clear enough this morning on my position with respect to the war in Iraq.''
The evolving situation in Iraq has, in fact, tested both candidates.
Mr. McCain, whose support for the war helped him win the Republican primary campaign, now finds he must explain his position to an electorate largely weary of the war. And for Mr. Obama, who recently changed his positions on campaign finance and a wiretapping law, the suggestion that he was also changing course on a central premise of his candidacy holds particular peril.
In his second news conference, Mr. Obama laid out his proposal in less ambiguous terms.
''Let me be as clear as I can be,'' he said. ''I intend to end this war. My first day in office I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in, and I will give them a new mission, and that is to end this war -- responsibly, deliberately, but decisively.
''And I have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades a month, and, again, that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months' time.''
Mr. Obama added that when he had spoken earlier about possibly refining his policies, he was referring to questions about how big a residual force should be left to train Iraqi forces and conduct counterterrorism operations, not the overall timeline for withdrawal.
Mr. Obama's positioning on this issue has been a critical component of his candidacy from the beginning. He, almost alone among the major candidates, opposed the war from the start, and that helped him beat a crowded Democratic field. And while he has long said he would consult commanders in the field when withdrawing troops, that point might have been lost on many Democratic primary voters who supported his call to end the war.
With violence ebbing in Iraq, however, he has recently spoken less about withdrawal and has increasingly emphasized the failure to achieve political reconciliation in that country. In recent weeks he has also spoken more of the economic costs of the war and the fact that it limits the United States' ability to send troops to fight what he considers the nation's primary security threat: Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Mr. McCain's support for the war, meanwhile, could pose problems for him in November. To that end, the Arizona senator, too, has shifted his emphasis. After being criticized for saying he would keep troops in Iraq for up to 100 years if necessary, Mr. McCain gave a speech this spring suggesting he would remove most troops by 2013, without offering specifics. He now talks more about withdrawing, as he did last week when he said ''we will withdraw, but we will withdraw with victory and honor.''
Iraq, of course, remains a dangerous place, as several lethal attacks last month showed. But fewer Americans were killed there in May than in any other month since the conflict began, and violence across the nation has dropped significantly. Foreign policy experts attribute the reduction to several factors, including the defection of Sunni insurgents who are now paid to keep the peace, the ceasefires brokered with various Shiite militias, the addition of more American troops -- the last of whom are leaving the country this month -- and adoption of a counterinsurgency strategy.
With an emerging consensus that the situation was helped in part by the troop buildup -- which Mr. Obama opposed and Mr. McCain strongly supported -- Republicans are now trying to put Mr. Obama on the defensive.
They are trying to put him in the political equivalent of a double bind: painting him as impervious to the changing reality on the ground if he sticks to his plan, and as a flip-flopper if he alters it to reflect changing circumstances.
''There is nothing wrong with changing your mind when the facts on the ground dictate it,'' Brian Rogers, a McCain campaign spokesman, said after Mr. Obama's remarks Thursday. ''Indeed, the facts have changed because of the success of the surge that John McCain advocated for years and Barack Obama opposed in a position that put politics ahead of country.''
Mr. Obama said that had not changed his mind at all -- and suggested that it was Mr. McCain who would have difficulty explaining his support for a long-term presence in a war that Mr. Obama called ''a strategic blunder.''
There have been increasing signs of debate among Democrats -- and seemingly among some Obama advisers -- about what to do in Iraq. A former foreign policy adviser to Mr. Obama, Samantha Power (who resigned her position in March after she was quoted calling Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton a ''monster'') gave an interview to the British Broadcasting Corporation in which she called the timetable for withdrawal a ''best-case scenario'' and suggested that as president in January 2009, Mr. Obama would not be bound by a campaign plan from 2008. The campaign disputed that assertion.
And eyebrows were raised this spring when one of Mr. Obama's outside advisers, Colin H. Kahl, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, helped to write a paper arguing against withdrawing the troops on a unilateral schedule, calling instead for ''conditional engagement'' in Iraq.
Campaign officials said that Mr. Kahl had been writing in his outside capacity, and that the paper did not represent their views.

HEADLINE: Fighting Inflation, Europeans Raise Rate

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- For the European Central Bank, dedicated to slaying the dragon of inflation, the moment of truth arrived Thursday. The bank raised its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent, making good on a promise last month that it would act to curb food and fuel prices.
But with Europe's economy slowing, the bank stopped well short of signaling the beginning of a new round of rate increases, as a lot of bank watchers had expected. ''Starting from here, I have no bias,'' the bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, declared at a news conference here. 
Mr. Trichet's measured words soothed markets, helped halt a slide in the dollar against the euro, and may have mollified European leaders worrying that higher exchange rates could choke their weakening economy.
The bank's decision to tighten credit has been watched, and debated, as much as any in its 10-year history because it comes just as economic growth appears to be deteriorating in Europe. It also widens the gulf in monetary policy between Europe and the United States, where the number of jobs declined for the sixth straight month in June.
The Federal Reserve, with interest rates half those in Europe, has so far not raised them, though it has indicated that inflation is a growing concern. Other central banks, from Scandinavia to Southeast Asia, lifted rates this week to combat a global wave of inflation.
''The E.C.B. is the only major central bank that is joining the smaller central banks in raising rates,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''The others are talking tough but the E.C.B. is the only one that is putting action to words.''
This has put the bank in an awkward position. Politicians in France and Germany urged it not to raise rates at such a fragile moment. Even within the bank's 21-member governing council, there was a raging debate about whether to act now or hold off, to avoid jeopardizing growth.
The latest statistics, which showed inflation in Europe spiking to 4 percent in June -- twice the upper limit set by the bank -- seems to have settled the debate for the moment, according to economists. Mr. Trichet said the vote to raise rates a quarter point was unanimous.
Underlining the argument that the move was more of a one-time gesture than the beginning of a trend, he repeated a warning to unions not to use inflation as a pretext to demand steep wage increases. The bank frets as much about so-called second-round effects as it does about inflation itself, according to economists.
''They've really gotten everyone's attention,'' said Holger Schmieding, chief European economist at Bank of America. ''Trade unions, governments, and others know the bank is dead serious.''
Politicians were muted about the rate increase, after days of noisy public pressure on the bank from President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, the German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, and other leaders.
But unions reacted sourly, disputing that inflation could start a wage-price spiral. ''The E.C.B. should realize we are no longer living in the '70s,'' the European Trade Union Federation said in a statement.
While Mr. Trichet reiterated that the central bank's overriding mandate was to manage expectations about inflation, he also acknowledged that the economic picture in Europe was worsening.
Manufacturing activity in the 15 countries that use the euro shrank in June for the first time in three years, according to a survey of European purchasing managers. In Spain and Ireland, where a collapse in housing prices has magnified the problems, there is real risk of a recession.
Europe's growth this year, Mr. Trichet conceded, would be ''not at all flattering,'' though he disputed suggestions that it faces stagflation similar to what occurred after the oil shock of the 1970s.
With Europe likely to slow further in coming months, however, economists said that the inflation hawks on the bank's governing council -- led by Axel Weber, the president of Germany's Bundesbank -- would find it difficult to round up votes for more than one additional rate increase this year.
''We still think there is a need to hike further,'' said Elga Bartsch, senior European economist at Morgan Stanley in London. ''But given what I heard today, there won't be any rush to do it.''
On a day when oil prices surged to a record above $145 a barrel, Mr. Trichet devoted a lot of attention to energy markets. He said European consumers needed to accept the reality of higher fuel prices, but he also issued a warning to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries not to hoard supplies.
''If we have a supplier-driven artificial scarcity, then it is very grave,'' Mr. Trichet said. ''To the extent that part of the present prices are coming from a cartel, this is very, very abnormal.''
Wading into a subject that is politically contentious in the United States, Mr. Trichet also urged industrialized countries not to hinder drilling and other types of exploration for oil. He declined to name the countries he had in mind, saying this was an issue in several of them.
The Bush administration has pushed for offshore drilling, as has the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain. Mr. Trichet met on Tuesday with the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., prompting speculation that the issue might have come up in that session.
Mr. Trichet dwelled on oil in part because it allowed him to make a historical point about the need to fight inflation.
Europe's failure to respond more quickly to the spiraling prices that followed the first oil shock of 1973, he said, sapped the Continent of its economic vitality and ability to create jobs for years afterward.

HEADLINE: In Britain, Concerns Over Oil Prices, Credit and Housing Echo Those in U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
A housing market in shambles, inflation at the highest level in years and signs that the economy is headed for, or already in, recession. Sound familiar?
 The British economy, like its counterpart across the Atlantic, has fallen on hard times, and in many ways the experience appears to be mirroring that in the United States. Indeed, the run last September on a British mortgage lender, Northern Rock, was one event that helped to embed the term ''credit crisis'' firmly into the global consciousness. 
 ''A recession is more likely than not by the end of the year,'' Peter Newland, who covers the British economy for Lehman Brothers, said Thursday, summarizing a string of dismal data that has led economists to revise their growth forecasts downward. ''Activity seems to be declining across the economy,'' he said. 
 The FTSE 100, the benchmark London stock index, has fallen about 19.6 percent from the high of 6,732.4 in June 2007 -- just short of the 20 percent decline that is commonly said to define a bear market. It lost 63.80 points, or 1.16 percent, to close at 5,412.8 on Friday.
 Consumer confidence is the lowest since 1990, as oil prices drive toward $150 a barrel and unemployment has risen for the last four months. 
 In a written statement to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday, Charlie Bean, deputy governor of the central bank, called the situation ''the most challenging set of circumstances since at least the early 1990s and possibly earlier.'' 
 The main force dragging down the British economy is the collapse of the once red-hot housing market, which enriched many British residents as long as credit flowed nearly as cheaply as in the United States.
 According to Nationwide Building Society, a leading British mortgage lender, housing prices have fallen for eight consecutive months. In June, prices fell 6.3 percent from a year earlier, the biggest drop since 1992, taking a ''typical'' home down to $:172,415, or about $343,000 -- a decline of more than $:13,500 from the top of the market. 
 The British central bank said Monday that mortgage approvals in May were at the weakest level on record -- only 42,000 for all of Britain, down from 58,000 in April.
 As the housing market sputters, consumers have retrenched. Shares in Marks & Spencer, the British retailer regarded as a bellwether of the domestic economy, plunged more than 25 percent in two days after it reported a sharp decline in sales. On Wednesday, Marks & Spencer said a consumer slowdown led to its biggest sales drop since 2005. 
 Gordon Brown, the beleaguered prime minister, sought to look on the bright side, while acknowledging that the remarkable run of prosperity over the previous decade has hit a wall.
 ''The task at the moment is to keep the economy moving forward,'' he said Thursday, speaking to a parliamentary committee in London. He expressed confidence that the economy was ''far more resilient than it was facing the last two oil shocks and facing some of the problems we had when there was a world downturn in the early '90s.'' 
 But that seems little consolation. Unions are agitating for higher wages, even as inflation rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate in May, above the 3 percent upper limit of the Bank of England's comfort zone. 
 Despite the growing distress of British workers and businesses, economists hold out little hope of monetary policy relief. Economists surveyed this week by Reuters were unanimous in predicting that Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, and his colleagues on the Monetary Policy Committee would hold rates unchanged at their meeting next Thursday. Only 23 of the poll of 72 economists surveyed this week forecast lower rates by year-end, down from 41 of 62 a few weeks ago.
 ''Wherever you look at the moment, the data are pretty worrying,'' Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight in London, said. ''It's a terribly difficult position for the Bank of England.'' The central bank's main interest rate target, at 5 percent, is already the highest among G7 countries.
 Economists said the economy was lagging slightly behind the American business cycle. The Federal Reserve has moved aggressively, cutting its main rate target to 2 percent from 5.25 percent last summer, and Congress moved quickly to enable 130 million households to receive tax rebate checks as part of a $168 billion stimulus program. 
 In contrast, the British government has little leeway to spend its way out of any slump. The public purse is constrained by two rules -- the so-called golden rule, in which the government borrows only to invest and not to finance current spending, and the sustainable investment rule, in which public sector debt is to be held stable at ''a stable and prudent level.'' 
 Mr. Archer estimated that the British economy would grow 1.4 percent in 2008, sharply slowing from 3.6 percent growth in 2007, and contract by 0.9 percent in 2009. The euro zone will probably grow 1.6 percent this year, down from 2.6 percent growth last year, and expand by 1.2 percent next year, he said. 
 Mr. Newland, the Lehman economist, predicted that the Bank of England would probably feel comfortable reducing rates by a quarter point in November, and by 1.25 points next year. ''Oil prices are the big uncertainty,'' he said. ''If oil prices don't fall, growth will be much weaker and rates will stay much higher for longer.''

HEADLINE: As Gas Prices Soar, Elderly Face Cuts in Aid

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND; Kevin Sack contributed reporting from Atlanta.

DATELINE: SOUTH HAVEN, Mich. 

 BODY:
Early last month, Jeanne Fair, 62, got her first hot meals delivered to her home in this lake town in the sparsely populated southwestern part of the state. Then after two deliveries the meals stopped because gas prices had made the delivery too expensive.
 ''They called and said I was outside of the delivery area,'' said Mrs. Fair, who is homebound and has not been able to use her left arm since a stroke in 1997.
 Faced with soaring gasoline prices, agencies around the country that provide services to the elderly say they are having to cut back on programs like Meals on Wheels, transportation assistance and home care, especially in rural areas that depend on volunteers who provide their own gas. In a recent survey by the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, more than half said they had already cut back on programs because of gas costs, and 90 percent said they expected to make cuts in the 2009 fiscal year. 
 ''I've never seen the increase in need at this level,'' said Robert McFalls, chief executive of the Area Agency on Aging in Palm Beach, Fla., whose office has a waiting list of 1,500 people. Volunteers who deliver meals or drive the elderly to medical appointments have cut back their miles, Mr. McFalls said. 
 Public agencies of all kinds are struggling with the new math of higher gas prices, lower property and sales tax revenues and increases in the minimum wage. Some communities have cut school bus routes, police patrols, traveling libraries and lawn maintenance. The St. Paul Police Department is encouraging officers to use horses and bikes. A number of state agencies, including those in Utah, are going to four-day workweeks to save energy costs and reduce commuting expenses for their employees. 
 But older poor people and those who are homebound are doubly squeezed by rising gas and food prices, because they rely not just on social service agencies, but also on volunteers. 
 In the survey of agencies, more than 70 percent said it was more difficult to recruit and keep volunteers.
 Mrs. Fair, who has limited mobility because of diabetes, lives on $642 per month in Social Security widow's benefits, and relies on care from her son, who often works odd hours, especially during blueberry season. ''He says, 'You belong in a nursing home; I can't take care of you,' '' Mrs. Fair said.
 The delivered meals allowed her to eat at regular hours, which helped her control her blood sugar levels, she said. Last year she lost her balance during a change in blood sugar and spent a month in a nursing home.
 With no meal delivery in her area, Mrs. Fair said her home aide, who comes three times a week, must pick up frozen meals from a center in the next town. 
 ''If my aide can't get the meals, maybe I can get my pastor to pick them up,'' Mrs. Fair said. ''I can't travel even to the drop-off center.''
 Val J. Halamandaris, president of the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, said that rising fuel prices had become a significant burden for the 7,000 agencies represented by his group, with some forced to close and others compelled to shrink their service areas or reduce face-to-face visits with patients.
 A recent survey by the group concluded that home health and hospice workers drove 4.8 billion miles in 2006 to serve 12 million clients. ''If we lose these agencies in rural areas, we'll never get them back,'' Mr. Halamandaris said. 
 The agencies, which have suffered from Medicare cuts in recent years, are lobbying Congress to account for fuel inflation in reimbursement rates and to reinstate special increases for providers in rural areas, a program that expired in 2006. 
 In Union, Mich., a town among flat corn and soybean farms near the Indiana border, Bill Harman, 77, relies on a home aide to take care of his wife, Evelyn, who is 85 and has Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Harman has had to use a wheelchair since 2000 because of hip problems.
 But the aide, Katie Clark, 26, may have to give up the job. She lives 25 miles away and drives 700 miles a week to provide twice-daily visits, helping Mrs. Harman dress in the morning and get to bed at night, feeding her, doing chores around the house. ''And putting up with a grumpy old man,'' she said jokingly to Mr. Harman. Her weekly income of $250 is being eaten up by gas expenses, which come to $100 a week. 
 ''Some weeks I have to borrow money to get here,'' said Ms. Clark, a single mother of two, adding, ''They're just like family to me.'' 
 Agencies say they are facing a shortage of home aides, because the jobs have low pay and often require long drives for a few hours of work. ''They can't make any money,'' said Laurence Schmidt, administrator for the Oswego County Office for the Aging, in rural northwest New York. ''So they'll get jobs in nursing homes, where they can drive to one place and work a full shift. That is a statewide problem.''
 Mr. Harman said that he thought a previous aide might have abused his wife, but that Mrs. Harman was comfortable with Ms. Clark. On a recent afternoon, Mrs. Harman called Ms. Clark ''honey''; Ms. Clark, walking Mrs. Harman to the bathroom, kissed her nose. Mrs. Harman said she was going home. Ms. Clark said, ''You are home, silly.'' 
 For her work, Ms. Clark receives $9 an hour. If she leaves, Mr. Harman said, he could not care for his wife.
 He said that when they married, she raised his five children as if they were her own. When Mrs. Harman started to develop Alzheimer's 8 or 10 years ago, he said, ''I promised her, 'Don't worry, I'll take care of you as long as I can.' ''
 Without an aide, he said, he would have to put his wife in a nursing home, and probably need to live in one himself. 
 For many isolated older people, home delivery of meals provides not just nutrition but also regular contact with the outside world, said Elaine Eubank, president of CareLink, a nonprofit agency that serves elderly people in six counties in Arkansas, delivering 480,181 meals to 18,000 people last year. Because of gas prices, Ms. Eubank said, one center in Monroe County had closed its kitchen, and others were delivering frozen meals two days a week. 
 Mary Margaret Cox, executive director of Meals on Wheels in Greeley, Colo., which serves meals to 300 people a day, said that her agency was trying to avoid shifting to frozen meals, but that it was getting hard to recruit students and teachers who volunteer during the summer. 
 ''Most don't have anyone else checking up on them daily,'' Mrs. Cox said of her clients. ''If we do more frozen meals, they'll lose that daily contact.'' 
 Many agencies said their revenues -- which come from state, federal and private sources -- were not keeping up with their increased expenses. ''We've had one increase from Medicaid in 11 years,'' Ms. Eubank said. ''But home care and Meals on Wheels keep people at home for a fraction of the cost of a nursing home. The state pays for care once they're in a nursing home. So our cuts may cost more than they save.'' 
 Sandra Prediger, 70, who still drives a car, said higher gas prices hit her every time she needed to go to the doctor. From her senior apartment in South Haven, she was barely able to pay her bills before gas prices rose.
 ''I try to help some of the ladies around here, driving them to doctors or to the store,'' Miss Prediger said, but a round trip to her doctor or the beauty shop now costs $26 in gas. She has had to ask her friends to pay half. ''I hate to ask,'' she said, ''because they have less than me.'' 
 Her Social Security check arrives on the third of the month. For the few days before, her local gas station lets her write a postdated check to fill up. 
 On July 2, Miss Prediger had no money and owed money to the gas station. ''In a few minutes,'' she said, ''my friend Shirley will probably call and say, 'Can you take me to Wal-Mart to get needles for my diabetes?' What else can I do?''
 Barbara Blumka, 67, of Buchanan, Mich., said she would continue delivering 15 or 16 meals a week though she could not afford it. She is driving a Dodge Caravan, a ''gas guzzler,'' she said.
 ''I see these people's faces,'' said Ms. Blumka, who gets her meals at a senior center. ''They're so appreciative. I think of all the people who took care of my mother in the nursing home. This is my way of giving thanks.''
 Christine Vanlandingham, development officer for the three-county Area Agency on Aging, said that in three to six months, the agency would have to start cutting meal deliveries to clients who get them now. 
 But Ms. Blumka will continue to help the homebound. Her nieces and nephews were buying her an adult tricycle for other travels. ''It's neon blue,'' she said. ''I'll ride it to the senior center.''

HEADLINE: Credit Card Overhauls Seem Likely

BYLINE: By JANE BIRNBAUM

 BODY:
Consumer advocates say regulation of the credit card industry has long been without teeth. But as card holders struggle under the weight of big balances, high interest rates and fees, their pleas to lawmakers for help may well mean that the industry will face some significant regulation by early next year.
 Regulators are saying, ''We missed the mortgage thing by not acting quickly enough,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski, federal consumer program director for the Public Interest Research Group. 
 The regulators are saying, ''People are losing their homes because the banks were unfair. Now we've got the credit card industry. And people will end up in debt for the rest of their lives, and maybe we ought to do something.'' 
 Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America in Washington, agreed that the mood had changed and said he was ''virtually sure'' there would be some regulation soon. ''The question,'' he said, ''is how meaningful it will be.'' 
 Until now, credit card companies have primarily been required to disclose their lending terms to borrowers. But consumer advocates have for years been saying that disclosure is not enough. 
 They have been pushing the federal government to take firmer control over the industry -- specifically, spelling out the circumstances under which lenders can raise and calculate interest rates and impose fees. 
 The proposed regulations take a big step in that direction. But they are strongly opposed by the industry, which has long beat back any regulatory constraints.
 The proposals for banks and other general-use credit card issuers are coming from a couple of directions. Working with the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Reserve introduced its proposals in early May. It has asked for comments and expects to formalize proposals by the end of the year. 
 At the same time, the legislation most likely to succeed in both the House and Senate sets similar rules on consumers' behalf. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, the Democrat of New York who wrote the House bill, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Democrat of Connecticut behind the Senate measure, said they planned to bring their measures to the floor for votes before Congress adjourns in September.
 The House and Senate bills as well as the Federal Reserve require that lenders apply payments to the debt with the highest interest rate. All would ban ''double cycle'' billing, in which interest is charged on some already repaid debt, and all would extend the time required, currently 14 days, between a statement mailing and payment due date. 
 All the measures would, under various conditions, prohibit lenders from raising interest rates on existing debt. The central bank proposes that except for increases caused by changes in stated variable and introductory offers, lenders may increase interest rates only if minimum payments are more than 30 days late. 
 Only the Dodd bill prohibits charges for paying by mail, phone or online, and restricts marketing and offers of credit to consumers under 21.
 The credit card industry continues to stand firm against regulation, especially law made by Congress. John G. Finneran Jr., the general counsel at Capital One Financial Corporation, testified in House hearings in March that ''it would be unwise -- especially at this time -- to enact broad legislation that sets payment formulas in statute, redefines critical product features and limits the tools of risk management for consumer credit.''
 Ken Clayton, senior vice president for card policy at the American Bankers Association, in Washington, contended in an interview that ''regulation can have unintended consequences, including reductions of popular low introductory-rate balance transfer offers and higher prices for prime borrowers.'' Fewer balance transfer offers could stifle job creation by entrepreneurs who use credit cards to borrow at the lowest possible cost, he added.
 According to Cardtrak.com, a research company in Naples, Fla., the median balance among the approximately 53 million households carrying general-use card debt from month to month is about $6,700, up from $5,900 five years ago. And with the economy slowing and unemployment rising, growing numbers of card holders are unable to keep up with their payments.
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the Federal Reserve acted last fall after the House approved legislation that would have transferred some of the Fed's regulatory power to other agencies. ''At that point, I said use it or lose it,'' Mr. Frank recalled. ''And subsequent to that, the Fed began using its authority, and is now proposing rules similar to those in our credit card bill.'' 
 Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a research institute in Howardsville, Va., that follows the Federal Reserve, said Congressional pressure had ''obviously played a role in moving the Federal Reserve away from a philosophy that rejected so-called prescriptive regulation and embraced disclosure as the principal basis for consumer protection.'' Mr. Schlesinger added, ''The new credit card proposals clearly suggest an increased willingness to engage in direct regulation.''
 Randall S. Kroszner, a Federal Reserve governor, said the central bank began considering the need for additional rules to protect consumers last year after it reviewed the comments on its proposal for greater lender disclosure of credit card terms. ''Many of these comments were submitted by consumers who indicated that in many cases, disclosure alone was not enough,'' Mr. Kroszner said.
 The House measure has 149 co-sponsors. Twenty of them, including two Republicans -- Representatives Chris Shays of Connecticut and Walter B. Jones of North Carolina -- sit on the 70-member House Financial Services Committee that must approve it before the House can vote. 
 Ms. Maloney said opponents had argued that her bill controls prices. ''But saying so does not make it so,'' she responded. ''We set no caps on fees or interest rates.'' 
 Mr. Dodd said he is hoping to get bipartisan support in the 21-member Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that he heads. He said passage requires public support. ''People must do something, whether organizing online or through community coalitions, or calling their elected representatives and saying, 'I need this, it's personal.' '' 
 Lawrence M. Ausubel, an economics professor at the University of Maryland and a bankruptcy expert, called lenders' warnings about unintended consequences ''severely overblown.'' Nothing in proposed legislation would prevent the card industry from continuing to be profitable, Professor Ausubel said: ''One can even tell stories where it enables more consumers to emerge from financial trouble without declaring bankruptcy, so collections might go up and profits improve,'' he said.
 None of the bills or proposals deals with the lenders' mandatory binding arbitration clauses that became standard in the late 1990s. Those clauses made class-action lawsuits charging lender wrongdoing almost impossible to bring, said Mr. Mierzwinski of the Public Interest Research Group. 
 Legislation called the Arbitration Fairness Act of 2007, written by Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, and Representative Hank Johnson Jr., Democrat of Georgia, ensures consumers the choice of jury trials. And in late April, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that a lower court must hear a case challenging mandatory arbitration.
 Adam J. Levitin, an associate professor of law and credit specialist at Georgetown University, said the proposed rules do not go far enough. 
 ''When the Federal Reserve or Congress tries to nip off specific abuses that the credit card industry practices, it becomes a game of Whack-A-Mole,'' Mr. Levitin said. ''As soon as they put the kibosh on one, the industry figures out another. 
 ''I think this has led to an endgame of restricting card issuers to a very limited number of price points -- explicit interest rates and fee categories -- and letting them compete their hearts out,'' he continued. ''But I don't think Congress or the Fed has recognized that reality yet, or has the political will to do it.''

HEADLINE: Why Fly When You Can Float?

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Imagine gliding in a floating hotel over the Serengeti, gazing down at herds of zebra or elephants; or floating over Paris as the sun sets and lights blink on across the city as you pass the Eiffel Tower.
 Such flights of fancy may one day be possible, if the dream of Jean-Marie Massaud, a French architect, comes true. 
 As the cost of fuel soars and the pressure mounts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, several schemes for a new generation of airship are being considered by governments and private companies. ''It's a romantic project,'' said Mr. Massaud, 45, sitting amid furniture designs in his Paris studio, ''but then look at Jules Verne.''
 It has been more than 70 years since the giant Hindenburg zeppelin exploded in a spectacular fireball over Lakehurst, N.J., killing 36 crew members and passengers, abruptly ending an earlier age of airships. But because of new materials and sophisticated means of propulsion, a diverse cast of entrepreneurs is taking another look at the behemoths of the air. 
 Mr. Massaud, a designer of hotels in California and a stadium in Mexico, has not ironed out the technical details, nor has he found financiers or corporate backers for his project -- to create a 690-foot zeppelin shaped like a whale, with a luxury hotel attached, that he has named Manned Cloud. 
 But not all projects are as fanciful as Mr. Massaud's. For example, a French technology start-up, Aerospace Adour Technologies, is working with the French post office to study the feasibility of transporting parcels by dirigible. Also in France, Theolia, a company specializing in renewable energy, is financing a dirigible, and plans a test flight across the Atlantic. 
 In Germany, Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei, the successor to the operator of the Hindenburg, has had success with a new generation of airship it uses to transport sightseers and scientific payloads.
 The trend is not entirely new. Zeppelin-Reederei carried 12,000 passengers on sightseeing tours over southern Germany last year. Aerophile, a French company that revived tethered balloons, which compete with dirigibles as carriers of passengers, advertising and scientific instruments, was founded by two young French engineers in 1993. 
 The aircraft industry is not exactly bracing for a dogfight. Mr. Massaud says that Emirates and Air France have expressed interest in Manned Cloud. But with top speeds of around 100 miles an hour and a maximum capacity of several dozen passengers, dirigibles are expected by most aviation experts to remain niche vessels for ferrying tourists, advertising and occasional scientific payloads. 
 ''A dirigible is something magical,'' said Jerome Giacomoni, who was 25 when he founded Aerophile with a friend. ''But most of the ideas are crazy.'' 
 Dirigibles, he said, ''are very sensitive to storms. Their size requires large landing spaces; economically they're not feasible.''
 Not yet, say dreamers like Mr. Massaud. But gasoline prices are pushing airlines to reduce the number of flights and retire older, less fuel-efficient aircraft. Aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have responded by promising planes that use less fuel and produce less carbon dioxide.
 Such concerns pushed Mr. Massaud to start thinking about dirigibles. Five years ago he worked on a design for a resort community in Palm Desert, Calif., but the result was so radical, involving tents rather than fixed buildings, that its developers balked. ''They said to me, 'You French, you're all Communists!' '' he said. 
 So Mr. Massaud conceived of Manned Cloud, a helium-filled dirigible shaped like a whale, with a cruising speed of 80 miles an hour and a cabin to accommodate 50 overnight guests and a crew of 25. ''The large whales made a choice in evolution to live in harmony with their environment,'' he said. ''They are symbols of life in harmony with nature.'' 
 Mr. Massaud submitted his design to the French aerospace agency, whose experts suggested he reduce the number of passengers to 15 and made other recommendations, but withheld judgment on his design's feasibility.
 ''There are niches where dirigibles might still serve,'' said Philippe Guicheteau, special adviser for military aeronautical systems at the agency, which goes by the French acronym Onera.
 In the United States, research into dirigibles continues, but mainly for military purposes. In 2005, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, briefly explored using airships to transport freight over long distances. Two other projects involving high-altitude airships, mainly for communications, continue.
 France's postal service, La Poste, has civilian uses in mind. Postal officials have long searched for alternatives to trucks and planes, aiming to reduce emissions by 15 percent by 2012. At a strategy meeting last year, officials decided to explore the use of dirigibles on routes between France and Corsica or French territories in the Antilles. 
 ''Dirigibles of the new generation are part of our strategy and represent an area of study for us,'' said Patrick Widloecher, director of sustainable development at La Poste. The postal service is working with Aerospace Adour, he said, to study the use of dirigibles.
 ''Over the medium term, the post office would like to test some pilot routes by dirigible, once a prototype has been developed and produced,'' Mr. Widloecher said. He said Aerospace Adour was studying a model 420 feet long with a cruising speed of 96 miles an hour.
 A dirigible, or rigid airship, has a metal frame, these days usually part aluminum, part carbon fiber, covered with a synthetic canvas. A blimp, in contrast, is a big, inflatable balloonlike sack filled with a lifting gas. Blimps are far less maneuverable than dirigibles and can lift less.
 Today's airships fly with helium, as did the Hindenburg until the United States imposed an embargo on what was then a fairly valuable commodity. Hence, the Hindenburg had to start using inflammable hydrogen on its flights. By the time of the explosion, zeppelins had carried about 405,000 passengers across the Atlantic.
 Airships still have their skeptics today. In Britain, an effort to revive the airship industry suffered a setback in 2005 when the Advanced Technologies Group, which planned to build airships called SkyCats, with a 22-ton payload, went bankrupt. An investor group has recently sought to revive it. The Cyclocrane, a large semirigid airship, was to be built in Germany by the start-up Cargolifter, but the company ran out of money in 2002 after a huge hangar was built. 
 Thomas Brandt, the chief executive of Zeppelin-Reederei and its parent, ZLT Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik, in Friedrichshafen, Germany, jeers at the notion of airships as hotels or freighters. ''Illusions,'' he said. ''Airships are unstable, they depend on the weather, so we fly today from March to November.''
 Mr. Brandt's company succeeded by scaling back its ambitions, ferrying thousands of sightseers and, occasionally, scientific payloads. The company manufactures a zeppelin that costs about $15 million; it just delivered its fourth model, to Airship Ventures, at Moffett Field, near Stanford, Calif. Tickets will cost about $500 for sightseeing trips over the Monterey Bay area. 
 French political leaders are among those who believe the ships can do more than ferry tourists. For two years, Jean-Marc Brule, a Green Party leader and mayor of Cesson, near Paris, has shepherded through budget amendments to finance dirigible research.
 ''With global warming and the oil crisis,'' he said, ''It's good sense to realize this dream.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 5 about the entrepreneurs who envision the comeback of the dirigible misidentified the country of origin of the CycloCrane, a semirigid airship that was envisioned as a cargo hauler. It was the United States, not Germany. The article also referred incorrectly to the gas used in the Hindenburg zeppelin, which burned and crashed in Lakehurst, N.J., in 1937. While it was designed to use helium, the Hindenburg flew with hydrogen from the beginning because of an American embargo on helium. It did not switch from helium to hydrogen.

HEADLINE: Questions of Taste in Queens

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
To the Bukharian Jews of Central Asia, a big house is an essential tradition: a place to shelter multiple generations, to hold large parties, memorials and holiday dinners, to reaffirm a community's unity.
 So wherever they have put down roots, Bukharians -- or, as they are sometimes called, Bukharans -- have built aggressively, including in central Queens, where tens of thousands have settled since the early 1990s and the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
 Nowhere has their love of big homes been on more opulent display than in a section of Forest Hills known as Cord Meyer, an upper middle class neighborhood long cherished by its residents for its tranquillity and architectural charm. 
 There, Bukharians have been tearing down the neighborhood's sedate Tudor, Georgian and Cape Cod-style homes, paving over lawns and erecting white-brick edifices that borrow from old Europe, with sweeping balustrades, stone lions bracketing regal double doorways, chateau-style dormers and pitched roofs, Romanesque and Greek columns and ornate wrought-iron balconies accented with gold leaf that glints in the sun. 
 But while the Bukharians' arrival has been a boon for the area's residential construction industry, it has been a bane for some neighbors. These residents have complained about the Bukharian tendency to build boldly and big, saying that the new houses are destroying their neighborhoods.
 ''There is a lot of history in the Cord Meyer area and a lot of historical houses that have a specific aesthetic character in that community,'' said Melinda R. Katz, a city councilwoman whose district includes Forest Hills. ''A lot of the houses that are going up there are just simply too big relative to the other houses that are there and have been there for generations. They are out of character.'' 
 The Bukharians contend that they are being misunderstood. 
 Indeed, what might seem on its surface like a parochial neighborhood quarrel over yards, fences and taste has revealed the complex civil society of a tight-knit immigrant community and the cultural tensions that have resulted from its rapid growth. 
 ''Don't be upset with our people because we like to be large,'' pleaded Boris Kandov, president of the Bukharian Jewish Congress of the U.S.A. and Canada, an umbrella group for Bukharian associations. 
 ''Let me tell you something,'' he continued in halting English. ''In Queens, most of the houses is old. New people build a new city. It's good for community.''
 More than 30,000 Bukharian Jews have settled in central Queens, mainly in Forest Hills, Rego Park, Kew Gardens Hills and Fresh Meadows. They now occupy sections of the commercial strips along 108th Street in Forest Hills, operate dozens of places of worship and yeshivas, run a weekly newspaper and prosper in a wide range of fields including jewelry, medicine and real estate.
 Critics of the new Bukharian architecture in Queens, many of whom are Jewish as well, have presented their complaints in private conversations with elected officials, at small civic meetings and on blogs. Some have taken the view that the Bukharian community is highly insular and that the Bukharians' tendency to build different from the rest of the neighborhood reflects that. 
 ''I could spit and throw up,'' said a Forest Hills resident of 51 years as she stood with her husband outside a big house under construction at 112th Street and 68th Avenue. The woman, who like other opponents interviewed for this story spoke only on condition of anonymity, admitted that she had never spoken with any of the Bukharian newcomers. 
 ''They don't want to talk to us,'' she said. ''They want to be alone.''
 Councilwoman Katz said that while the Bukharian homes in her district have complied with the city's building and zoning regulations, she, too, was concerned about their size and the loss of green space, particularly in the Cord Meyer area between 108th Street and the Grand Central Parkway, where nearly every block has at least one newly completed house and another one under construction.
 Ms. Katz, who is chairwoman of the Council's Land Use Committee, has been working with the City Planning Department on new zoning regulations that would limit the size of new houses in Cord Meyer and other architecturally sensitive areas and create what she calls ''a more stable community.'' 
 The Bukharians have made their architectural mark elsewhere in Queens, albeit not as ostentatiously as in Forest Hills. In the middle class neighborhoods of Kew Gardens Hills and Fresh Meadows, for instance, they have not so much been tearing down the signature brick row houses as adding extensions, paving over yards and erecting walls around their properties.
 ''We like to utilize every single square inch of land, every inch of territory,'' explained Rabbi Shlomo Nisanov, head of a Bukharian synagogue and community center in Kew Gardens Hills. ''For some reason, people don't appreciate it.''
 One afternoon late last week, Mr. Nisanov, a blocky man who was born in Uzbekistan and emigrated to Kew Gardens Hills when he was a child, took a stroll through his neighborhood and delivered something of a short course in Bukharian immigrant culture.
 He showed how in the space of a decade, Bukharians, mainly from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, had come to dominate some residential blocks, as relatives bought homes within walking distance of one another and some extended families crowded under one roof. Their houses were easy to identify by their bricked front patios and front walls. 
 ''What makes Bukharian Jews unique is they love to stay together,'' he said. 
 The Bukharian tendency to pave over everything is practical, he continued. Bukharians preferred a terrace or patio to a lawn, which he called ''useless land.'' A yard required mowing -- ''a waste of time,'' he said. 
 ''Exhibit A,'' he said, gesturing to a brick row house on 76th Road. It had a verdant front yard that seemed to beg for mowing and pruning. ''You see this?'' he said dismissively. ''What is this? What are we seeing here?''
 He then pointed to the house next door. ''Exhibit B,'' he declared. The house was fronted by a well-swept terrace of red and black paving stones and enclosed within a five-foot-high wall that, he said, ensured some privacy. Any remaining green was an accent rather than a feature. 
 ''You can eat outside, the kids have a place to play,'' the rabbi said. ''You have usage of the front of your house.''
 ''It's nice, it's beautiful,'' he added. ''What are you afraid of?''
 Mr. Kandov, who immigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan in 1987 and runs a limousine fleet and other family-owned businesses, said the largeness of the Bukharian home in Queens was an expression of freedom after years of oppression in the Soviet Union. 
 ''Why are we in America?'' he said while sitting in his office in his group's headquarters, a five-story, 43,000-square-foot building in the main commercial district of Forest Hills. ''Because we're dreaming of this freedom! We were dreaming to build big house.'' 
 On the walls hung two enormous paintings in thick gold-colored frames, one showing the British surrender to Washington at Yorktown and the other depicting Moses' liberation of the Jews in Egypt. 
 ''It's not to show that we're rich,'' he insisted. ''I'm feeling this. Bukharian Jews feel O.K., it's good, thanks God.''
 Alexander Yakubov, a Bukharian real estate agent in Forest Hills, said his decision to partially demolish an old house in Forest Hills to make way for a larger one had nothing to do with grandiose notions of spiritual expression and everything to do with the economy of home ownership. 
 The house was old, he said, and it would have cost more to renovate and expand than to knock down and build new. ''Anybody would love to save money and move into a ready house,'' he said. 
 The most ostentatious Bukharian construction has given Rabbi Itzhak Yehoshua, the chief rabbi of the Bukharian Jews in the United States, some pause. He said he urged modesty among his congregation in order to avoid tensions in the community, but he has met resistance.
 ''I tell them all the time that our ancestors taught us about being humble,'' he said during an interview in his small office in the Bukharian Congress building in Forest Hills. ''They say, 'Rabbi, this is our home for entertainment, it's our fortress. Now we work' -- and they work very hard -- 'and this is our understanding of America.' '' 
 He went on: ''I am very happy and proud that my congregation interprets freedom to be successful and to work honestly and to settle and to help the community. And each house is another stone to help create the Jewish community.''
 Worried about the widening divide between the Bukharian and non-Bukharian communities in central Queens, Cynthia Zalisky, executive director of the Queens Jewish Community Council, a social services agency for immigrants, said she has been trying to soften the discussion about the Bukharian homes. 
 ''It's a very delicate situation,'' she admitted. Property owners are entitled to their design decisions within the law, she said, but she is also trying to encourage the Bukharian immigrants to view themselves as ''part of a whole, not just an entity unto themselves.'' 
 ''We're trying to see whether there's some compromise here,'' she went on. ''We got to put our heads together like the United Nations.''

HEADLINE: New Head of Development Bank Puts Focus on Russia

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD and ALISON SMALE

 BODY:
Western countries need to be ambitious and patient in fostering democracy in Russia and the strategic region arching from the Balkans to Central Asia, according to the new president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
 On his first day as president Thursday, Thomas Mirow, a former secretary of state in the German Finance Ministry, said he would lead the bank with the conviction that ''democracy will not prevail if the material financial status of people is deteriorating and not improving.'' But he also warned against any unhelpful zeal. 
 ''We have to recall how difficult democracy-building was in some of our own countries,'' Mr. Mirow said in an interview, adding that he was ''speaking as a German.'' 
 He suggested that his success would depend on the West's relations with Russia and the evolution of the continuing financial crisis and credit squeeze. The twin pressures of rising food costs and fuel prices could nurture a dangerous form of populism in young democracies, he said. 
 Founded at the end of the cold war to bring free markets to Communist countries in Central Europe, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has been looking farther east. Four years after eight former Soviet satellites joined the European Union, the bank is considering accepting Turkey as a client and has been shifting its investments to Central Asian countries and the Caucasus. 
 One measure of the bank's achievements is that it ended its activities in the Czech Republic last year and plans to phase out investments in all other new European Union member nations, save Bulgaria and Romania, by 2010. With tension rising between a newly assertive Russia and the West, and the Middle East unstable, Mr. Mirow stressed that Europe in particular had a vital interest in far-flung places that were long off the West's radar screen. 
 Energy-rich countries like Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan and strategically important former Soviet republics like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have become the focus of a struggle for influence among outside powers. 
 '''There will be a huge competition of who gets influence in these countries,'' he said. ''It will matter a great deal whether these countries take the path of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan,'' as different as they are, ''or whether they will align with Russia or whether they get a way of their own.'' 
 As these alternatives play out, Mr. Mirow said, ''we will stick to our aspirations but on the other hand be aware that there will probably be a lot of setbacks and one must not be exhausted by them.'' 
 Much will depend on how the new Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, a 42-year-old former lawyer, interacts with the West and how the next president of the United States shifts foreign policy as of January, Mr. Mirow said. 
 ''We will see a new pattern of international relations at the end of this decade,'' he said. Whether a Democrat or a Republican wins in the United States, ''it will be interesting to see how they will determine U.S. foreign policy, U.S. foreign economic policy, specifically in relation to Russia.'' 
 The United States is the biggest single stakeholder in the development bank, with 10 percent of the shares. A majority of shares belong to the 27 nations of the European Union; Germany alone owns 8.5 percent. 
 Reflecting the deep alliance of Germany with the United States, but also Germany's historic ties to Russia and dependence on Russian energy, Mr. Mirow drew a clear distinction between what he called the European Union's recent efforts to engage Moscow ever more deeply and the standoffish stance of the current American administration. 
 ''There are differences in the appreciation between the U.S. and the E.U.,'' he said of the West's approach to Russia. Recently, he noted, Europe as a whole, and in particular powers like France and Germany, has ''developed more relations than the U.S.'' 
 Mr. Mirow, who in his old job traveled widely in Russia, said he had spoken with several experts about the Russian leadership, which for the first time appears split between Mr. Medvedev and his patron and predecessor, Vladimir V. Putin, now prime minister. 
 ''Nobody dares to predict'' whether Mr. Putin will keep the reins of power or eventually fade from the scene once he is satisfied that his protege is both secure and carrying out Putin policies, Mr. Mirow said. 
 He said it was too early to judge the new leadership, but he saw ''encouraging signs'' -- in particular reports that Anatoly B. Chubais, long a leader of the most liberal faction in Russia's business and political elite, could play an influential role negotiating a new accord between Russia and the European Union. 
 Although crucial members of the union are sharply divided over whether Turkey should eventually become a member, Mr. Mirow said he hoped Turkey would join the bank this fall. Asked whether this would help Turkey in its quest for European Union membership, he stressed that ''the E.B.R.D. is not an instrument of E.U. foreign policy.'' But he acknowledged that ''this may contribute to the country finding the path to Europe.''

HEADLINE: Consortium Rescues Bell Canada Takeover

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
A private equity and pension fund consortium said it salvaged a record $52 billion deal for Bell Canada on Friday by postponing its closing date until mid-December and renegotiating some terms of the transaction -- including canceling dividend payments on the telecommunication giant's common stock.
 A group of four banks, including Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, which originally agreed to provide about $34 billion in financing for the blockbuster purchase when it was first announced last year, had been demanding changes in the original terms because of the many challenges brought on by the continuing credit squeeze. 
 The deal, the largest leveraged buyout to date, was originally scheduled to close on Monday but had gotten mired in response to bankers' concerns and legal issues. The new closing date is Dec. 11. Because the deal is structured under a unique Canadian court procedure, repricing it to address the lenders' concerns would have been difficult and time-consuming.
 But the new agreement gets around that problem -- and effectively reduces the purchase price by about $1.5 billion, just under $2 a share -- by postponing the closing date and halting the dividend payments.
 Shareholders, however, will still receive the original price of 42.75 Canadian dollars ($41.96) -- for their shares, an amount that is high by current market standards.
 The bank group, which is lending about 85 percent of the purchase price, also extracted slightly higher interest rates from the purchasers and some changes to the lending agreements, said a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations who declined to be named because he was not an official spokesman for the group.
 A Bell spokesman, William J. Fox, declined to estimate how much extra cash would flow into the company's coffers from the canceled dividend payments and general revenue.
 On Monday, Bell, which is based in Montreal and is Canada's largest telecommunications company, announced that it was deferring its second-quarter common share dividend payments and estimated doing so would save it about 294 million Canadian dollars ($288 million). 
 Although the credit crisis has not abated and banks have come under greater financial pressures as the American economy sags, participants in the Bell transaction said they were optimistic that there would be no further delays and that the deal would close in December.
 Another roadblock had been a legal challenge from bondholders who argued that the deal unfairly depressed the value of the company's current debt. While a Quebec appeals court upheld that complaint and effectively struck down the deal, its ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada last month. 
 ''The signing of the financing and credit agreements and the resolution of issues involved in funding this transaction are the essential milestones to closing with both the purchaser and the lenders,'' said Michael J. Sabia, the chief executive of Bell, in a statement.
 Deborah Allan, a spokeswoman for the lead purchaser, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, said that ''everyone will see this as being positive.'' The other main buyers include Providence Equity Partners, Madison Dearborn Partners and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity.
 Mr. Sabia, who was scheduled to leave the company when the transaction closed, will now step down on July 11. He will be replaced by George Cope, who heads the Bell telephone operations in Ontario and Quebec.
 Under terms announced Monday, the buyers agreed to increase the fee they would pay if the takeover was not completed to 1.2 billion Canadian dollars ($1.18 billion), from 1 billion Canadian dollars.
 ''It speaks to the commitment of the purchase group,'' Mr. Fox said.

HEADLINE: Price Increases Put Pressure on the Fed

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
WHICH costs more, the car or the gasoline?
 In the United States, the quarter that just ended was probably the first period since the early 1980s that a bigger proportion of the consumer's pocketbook was spent on gasoline, oil and other energy products than was spent on motor vehicles. 
 But even as the price of gasoline has soared to more than $4 a gallon, Americans are spending a much smaller share of their budgets on fuel than they did at the time of the last spike in oil prices, in 1980.
 The accompanying chart shows that spending on motor vehicles -- both buying them and fixing them -- tends to take a smaller share of spending during recessions, as consumers cut back on big ticket items. Based on the dismal figures for car and truck sales in June that came out this week, that appears to be happening. And the 4.2 percent share of consumer spending that went to cars in the first quarter seems likely to have fallen in the quarter that just ended.
 But the share devoted to the purchase of gasoline and other fuels certainly increased, even though there are indications Americans have cut back on driving. Gasoline prices in the quarter averaged more than 20 percent higher than in the first three months of 2008. The share of spending on fuels seems likely to have risen well above the 4.1 percent mark recorded then.
 Historically, rapidly rising gasoline prices have hurt the auto industry, and that seems to be happening now. The carmakers have no trouble selling fuel-efficient vehicles, particularly hybrids that can run on electricity as well as gasoline. Until recently the demand for those vehicles was limited, though, and it is not easy to increase production quickly. But the gas-guzzling vehicles, particularly sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, have plunged in demand, leaving the carmakers with large inventories at a time when prices for similar used vehicles have fallen sharply.
 Even before gasoline hit $4 a gallon, the motor vehicle share of personal consumption expenditures had fallen to its lowest level since shortly after World War II, when the automobile industry was just beginning to increase production after converting to military production during the war.
 The chart shows just how unusual the 2001 recession was, in that it took place with no visible setback in the auto share of the consumer pocketbook, as had occurred in previous downturns. The auto companies are suffering now, when some economists think a recession is under way.
 The share of personal consumption expenditures going to gasoline and other fuels rose to its highest level in more than two decades in the first quarter. But that is well short of the record of 6 percent, reached in four quarters in 1980 and 1981, when oil prices were high and the economy was suffering through two recessions.
 These figures are based on government figures on personal consumption expenditures, and may seem a little odd to many, who think the proportion of their disposable income going to gasoline is much larger than the figures would suggest.
 They have a point. A growing part of personal consumption expenditures goes to medical services, much of which is not paid directly by consumers. In the most recent quarter, that area took 17.5 percent of spending, up from around 11 percent in the early 1980s when the fuel spending set a record.

HEADLINE: Accounting Plan Would Allow Use Of Foreign Rules

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal officials say they are preparing to propose a series of regulatory changes to enhance American competitiveness overseas, attract foreign investment and give American investors a broader selection of foreign stocks.
 But critics say the changes appear to be a last-ditch push by appointees of President Bush to dilute securities rules passed after the collapse of Enron and other large companies -- measures that were meant to forestall accounting gimmicks and corrupt practices that led to those corporate failures. 
 Legal experts, some regulators and Democratic lawmakers are concerned that the changes would put American investors at the mercy of overseas regulators who enforce weaker rules and may treat investment losses as a low priority.
 Foreign regulators are beyond the reach of Congress, which oversees American securities regulation through confirmation proceedings, enforcement hearings and approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget. 
 The commission is preparing a timetable that will permit American companies to shift to the international rules, which are set by a foreign organization and give companies greater latitude in reporting earnings. Companies that have used both domestic and overseas rules have, on average, been able to report revenues and earnings that were 6 percent to 8 percent higher under the international standards, according to accounting experts.
 Though foreign accounting standards are stronger in some ways than American accounting principles, they are weaker in some important areas. They enable companies, for example, to provide fewer details about mortgage-backed securities, derivatives and other financial instruments at the center of today's housing crisis and that have troubled many Wall Street firms, including Bear Stearns.
 The shift to international standards could also wind up eliminating the conflict-of-interest rules, adopted after the collapse of Arthur Andersen and Enron, that have limited auditors from performing both accounting work and consulting for the same client. 
 James D. Cox, a securities law expert at Duke Law School who returned this week from teaching corporate law in Europe, said the shift to international rules amounted to ''outsourcing safety standards.''
 ''We would not for a moment tolerate having American auto safety standards set by China or India,'' he said. ''Why should we do it for financial safety standards? There has to be some accountability.''
 The S.E.C. also plans to announce details of a pilot program that would enable foreign brokers to deal directly with American investors, while continuing to be largely regulated by the foreign country. The first country in the program will be Australia, although officials hope to eventually include other countries. In a third move, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which works under the supervision of the S.E.C., is preparing a rule that would allow it to defer to foreign regulators for inspections of some of the 800 foreign auditors of overseas companies that sell stock in the United States. 
 The oversight board was created by the Sarbanes-Oxley law of 2002 in response to the accounting scandals at Enron and other large companies. The law requires the board to inspect regularly all accounting firms that certify the financial results of companies whose shares are sold in the United States.
 Officials say the proposed changes reflect the decades-long push toward global markets. They say the changes are necessary to attract capital from abroad and will protect Americans as they increasingly look to invest overseas. In the decade ending last November, American holdings of foreign stock increased to $4.3 trillion from $1.2 trillion.
 ''You are seeing a world now where everything is mobile,'' Ethiopis Tafara, director of international affairs at the S.E.C., said in an interview. ''You have securities issuers that are mobile. Broker dealers can provide services from anywhere. Exchanges are mobile, and electronic trading platforms don't need a physical location. You have capital that is mobile, it travels almost anywhere around the world.''
 ''When you have everything that is mobile, the way we think about our mandate -- investor protection and enforcement -- has to take this into account,'' Mr. Tafara said.
 Mr. Tafara said that the mutual recognition agreement with Australia would continue to protect American investors because the S.E.C. would continue to have the authority to prosecute foreign companies under antifraud provisions of the law for what he called ''lying, stealing and cheating.'' The S.E.C. would continue to investigate accusations of illegal insider trading, for example, an area where the commission has been more vigorous than many foreign jurisdictions. 
 But the S.E.C. would not enforce many investor-protection laws involving issues ranging from the quiet period before a stock offering to market manipulation, financial disclosures and abusive trading tactics. Nor would foreign officials apply a panoply of American securities rules that are unique in that they are intended to protect minority shareholders. Instead, the commission would rely on its Australian counterpart to enforce its securities regulations, which often involve different standards. 
 In a speech earlier this year, Christopher Cox, the agency's chairman, said that working on the transition to international accounting standards and reaching enforcement agreements with foreign countries like the Australians were two of the most important items on his agenda as his term comes to a close. 
 ''It is no longer possible for the S.E.C. to do its work in the United States without a truly global strategy -- because, in large measure due to today's instant communications and technology, what goes on in other markets and jurisdictions is now intimately bound up with what happens here,'' he said. 
 But critics say that the move toward harmonizing rules and enforcement practices is fraught with problems and would dilute American securities laws, generally considered to be the most protective of investors in the world. 
 ''The impetus for these changes has been a generalized concern about competitiveness but the results could very well be a weakening of rules,'' said Senator Jack Reed, the Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Senate banking subcommittee on securities and investment, which has jurisdiction over the S.E.C. ''The notion that we're becoming rapidly globalized is clear. There is a need for harmonized rules. But the real question is, are the foreign rules any good?''
 ''We've heard this argument about competitiveness for the last two years,'' Mr. Reed added. ''But guess what? There are a lot of lost jobs on Wall Street not because of competitiveness issues but because our regulators have actually not been up to the task.''
 Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said the proposals would ''weaken the pressure for credible oversight'' of the markets and their regulators.
 ''This is a very, very serious problem,'' Mr. Levin said. ''We've had so many losses to investors based on inadequate oversight. We can't proceed to give control of regulation -- to delegate or cede control -- to bodies that are not accountable. If this is delegated to regulators overseas, it weakens our ability to put pressure on the regulators to do what the law requires them to do.''
 Although the staff of the S.E.C. has been working on the changes for many months, the agency has been hampered by vacancies at the top. Those vacancies were filled last week, when the Senate confirmedthree new commissioners, including two Democrats, to the five-member commission. To adopt the changes, Christopher Cox, the agency's chairman, will need to get the support of at least two commissioners.
 Industry groups have pushed for many of the changes. Large international accounting firms, for example, have complained that the emergence of a new generation of American and foreign regulators inspecting them has led to onerous duplication.
 Jeff Willemain, global managing partner for regulatory and risk at Deloitte, said at a roundtable discussion in Washington last week that the emerging system of ''multiple and duplicative'' inspections of audit firms by different countries has created ''inefficiencies'' that do not result in greater investor protection.
 But the track record of foreign enforcement authorities indicates that they are generally less aggressive than their counterparts in the United States, and that even the most vigorous ones bring fewer cases and impose significantly lower penalties.
 ''Few if any countries spend as much on -- or devote as much intensity of effort to -- enforcement of financial reporting and auditing as the U.S. does,'' said Charles D. Niemeier, a member of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, who has dissented from its proposal to let foreign authorities inspect auditors. Referring to the fact that foreign investigations are often not wide-ranging, he added, ''Even the most robust of those other regulators have faced scope limitations and other challenges that we would not countenance.''
 But foreign regulators say it is absurd to think that the United States has the ability to police markets alone.
 ''Let's be clear -- no single jurisdiction can resolve all the problems of globalization,'' said Pierre Delsaux, a senior markets regulator at the European Commission. ''We are all doing the same thing. No country has a monopoly on protecting investors.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Study Access to Liberty's Crown

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The National Park Service has started inching closer to reopening the Statue of Liberty's crown for the first time since the 9/11 attacks by seeking ways to make access safer.
 The park service is seeking bids from engineers and architects to study whether alterations to the crown would make it safer for visitors to evacuate in case of an emergency. The crown is currently accessible only by a narrow, double-helix-shaped staircase that is not in compliance with federal, state or city fire and building codes. The issue of whether the stairway was ever in compliance was not raised publicly until after 9/11. 
 If changes to the statue are not practical, the park service will look for other ways of minimizing the dangers, possibly by limiting the number of visitors. 
 The park service acknowledged it was considering reopening the crown after Representative Anthony D. Weiner provided reporters on Friday with a copy of the agency's request for proposals. The Daily News reported the park service's decision on Friday.
 Mr. Weiner, during a news conference on Friday in Battery Park with the statue behind him, said the off-limits crown was an ''embarrassment'' to the city and demonstrated a ''lack of creativity and imagination'' on the part of the park service. 
 Mr. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens and Brooklyn, helped arrange a Congressional hearing in September on reopening the crown.
 ''Something that many of us remember from our youth -- going up those narrow stairwells, getting up on our tippy-toes, looking out through the crown to one of the most glorious vistas you can imagine,'' Mr. Weiner said, ''that experience has been denied to visitors now for seven Fourth of Julys.''
 As possible solutions, Mr. Weiner suggested caps on the number of visitors, strict height and weight guidelines and requiring visitors to sign waivers acknowledging the risks.
 Liberty Island was closed to the public after the 9/11 attacks. The statue's base reopened on Aug. 3, 2004, after a $20 million effort to improve fire safety, security and evacuation routes. But the crown remained closed because the park service said it posed a potentially catastrophic hazard to visitors.
 The decision to look at the feasibility of reopening the crown came in response to a request by Congress at the September hearing, David Barna, a spokesman for the park service, said on Friday. He said the park service wants to have a study on reopening the crown completed by January.
 Advocates who have sought the reopening praised the decision but said they hoped the park service would find a way to open the crown before any renovations were completed -- a move the park service said it was not considering.
 Alexander R. Brash, the northeast regional director of the National Parks Conservation Association, said, ''We think it is high time to open the crown, and certainly by next Independence Day at the very latest.'' He added, ''The more people who can experience it, the more awe-inspiring their visit to the statue, the better.''
 When the roughly 10 flights of steps leading to the crown from the top of the pedestal were open to the public, park rangers were regularly faced with visitors with medical problems, including those with heat exhaustion, panic attacks and claustrophobia, according to a park service statement. The park service said the stairs were originally intended to be used by maintenance workers.
 The statement, issued on Friday, noted that the statue's creator, Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, never envisioned visitors climbing to the crown.
 ''The Statue of Liberty is being experienced as intended,'' the park service said, ''from the waters of the harbor, on Liberty Island, and within the pedestal itself up to an observation deck that affords breathtaking 360-degree views of New York harbor.''
 Critics of closing the crown have said that it has hurt the economy by reducing tourism at the statue. Mr. Weiner said that in 2006, the number of visitors decreased to 2.5 million from 3.6 million visitors in 2000. The park service said on Friday, however, that about 3.2 million people visited the statue last year and that it expected to see an even higher number this year.

HEADLINE: Need Help Finding Your Bliss? Hire a Coach

BYLINE: By SUSAN MORAN

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo. 

 BODY:
A 43-year-old man is weary of teaching high school but has no clue how else to make a living. A 67-year-old man wants to leave banking but does not want to retire before leaving a more positive mark on the world. A 52-year-old woman is an emergency room doctor who loves her work but pines for more downtime.
 All of them took part in a workshop in Boulder recently that was led by a career ''intuitive'' named Sue Frederick -- a former career counselor who draws upon her dreams, ancient numerology and conversations with spirits to ''see your dream job.'' 
 As the economic slump continues, many workers, even those who hate their jobs, are reluctant to look for more satisfying work. But others are turning to nontraditional career counselors and coaches to help them navigate transitions in their lives and careers. 
 These workers have read the umpteenth edition of ''What Color Is Your Parachute?'' by Richard Nelson Bolles and have mastered the Myers-Briggs personality test. Now they crave something more offbeat and probing.
 Lucky for them, there are as many flavors of career counselors -- and more recently coaches, including ''psychic'' and ''intuitive'' ones -- as there are careers. Career counselors tend to explore psychological undercurrents with clients, and they often have a master's degree in counseling. Coaches typically come from the corporate world and focus on goal-setting.
 It is not just residents of Boulder, a mecca for all things organic and spiritual, who flock to Ms. Frederick's ''career intuition boot camp'' and individual sessions in person or over the phone. 
 ''I don't want to come across as a new age-y kind of guy with my head in the stars, because as a New Yorker type that's the last thing I am,'' said Gary Purnhagen, 55, who started his own management consulting business in Manhattan a few months ago after spending 20 years working for companies. ''But going to Sue was probably the best decision I've ever made in terms of reaching out.''
 Several months ago Mr. Purnhagen left a financial printing company that was laying people off. He trolled the Internet for counselors and coaches. When he saw Ms. Frederick's Web site he was drawn to her big smile and her message that your dream job should make you giggle when you speak of it.
 Then, call it coincidence or destiny, a consultant friend of his in New York suggested that he check out a career coach named Sue Frederick, and Mr. Purnhagen tossed his skepticism aside. Four one-hour phone sessions and $500 later, he said he is more focused, confident and trusting in his ability to build a lucrative clientele.
 Ms. Frederick, 58, trained as a career counselor in the 1970s at the University of Missouri. She worked at the university and later in the private sector. But she yearned to add to her repertoire her self-described clairvoyance, which she says she discovered when she was a child who would dream about things that would often happen later that day.
 Her husband warned that she would lose corporate clients if she called herself a career intuitive, but she did anyway. ''Soon I had more clients than I knew what to do with,'' Ms. Frederick told the 29 people at a recent workshop.
 When career coaches jumped onto the scene a decade ago they were looked upon suspiciously by career counselors as inexperienced, brash interlopers. But since 1999, when the International Coach Federation began offering certification training for coaches, their reputation has risen steadily.
 Today, roughly 3,700 people in the United States are certified by the federation. But anyone can call herself a coach; in fact, roughly 30,000 people do just that, estimates Diane Brennan, president of the federation. Hundreds of organizations offer some form of coaching certifications.
 ''A lot of people call themselves coaches because it's the hot thing to do,'' Ms. Brennan said.
 This factor is reflected in the rates coaches charge -- up to $400 an hour. For many clients, seeing a coach feels far more upbeat, even more upscale, than working with a counselor. This makes some traditional career counselors fear they may become obsolete. 
 ''A lot of people see having a coach as a prestigious thing, whereas going to a career counselor is often associated with having a problem,'' said Maria Greco, a licensed professional counselor in Boulder with a Ph.D. in university administration.
 A coach is more like a personal trainer, who coaxes clients to set and meet their job or career goals. A sure sign that you are talking to a coach is ''five steps to'' or ''seven rules for.'' The cover of Ms. Frederick's 2004 book, ''Dancing at Your Desk: A Metaphysical Guide to Job Happiness,'' promises ''The 7 Secret Steps to Finding Work You Love.''
 Joel Garfinkle, a career coach in Oakland, Calif., said his seven-step formula to finding a dream job sets him apart.
 ''It's all about aligning your natural gifts and talent to your passions that will equal a career that is 100 percent about fulfillment,'' said Mr. Garfinkle, with the turbo-charged delivery of a football coach. 
 What draws people to a career counselor or coach depends on their age, their location and the industry they work in. For instance, even though Silicon Valley has averted the worst of the economic slowdown, some people who have lost their job are asking whether the long commute and the grueling workdays are worth it before they start interviewing for a new job.
 ''I'm seeing more people looking for quality of life, balance and a change that will give them something that'll be more enduring and more of a natural expression of who they are,'' said Norm Meshriy, a career counselor in Walnut Creek, Calif. 
 Career counselors and coaches also say they are seeing more college students and recent graduates.
 ''Students are very concerned about the amount of debt they are graduating with, the sluggish economy, loss of jobs in numerous areas due to the housing bust, skilled jobs going overseas and fewer opportunities outside the service industries,'' Linda Bates Parker, president of Black Career Women, a nonprofit devoted to the career development of black women, wrote in an e-mail. She is also director of career development at the University of Cincinnati.
 At the other end of the career lifeline, a small but growing number of baby boomers are summoning career counselors and coaches. 
 Keyren H. Cotter, 67, is a loan officer at a bank in Denver. With a Ph.D. in materials science, Mr. Cotter, known as Casey, worked for years in engineering before moving into mortgage banking. But it was not the mortgage crisis that recently sent him to Ms. Frederick's career workshop. 
 ''I ask myself, 'What's my legacy? Why am I here?' '' Mr. Cotter said. ''I'm at a period where I'm no longer motivated by money. I'm looking for something with more substance and more meaning.''
 In the weeks since the workshop, Mr. Cotter saw Ms. Frederick for a one-hour session. He recalled that when he walked into her office she said, ''I've been meditating on you. I think you should make movies.'' Now he is considering combining his interest and experience in financing with documentary filmmaking.
 ''It's too early to know,'' Mr. Cotter said. ''But I know I'm getting unstuck.''

HEADLINE: False Victory at the Border

 BODY:
How secure is the border? The opinion of government optimists is that it is way secure. So secure you wouldn't believe it -- and not as secure as it will be. 
 That is the least the country should expect after all it has given up to lock the border down. Billions of dollars since the 1980s in fencing, razor wire, electronic sensors and vehicle barriers. A major deployment of 6,000 National Guard troops in 2006, to bolster the Border Patrol. The trashing of the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act and a host of environmental and land-management laws. (When Congress ordered the homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, to build 670 miles of border fence by the end of this year, it decreed that no law or judge, no wild creature or endangered homeowner, should stop him. Last month, the Supreme Court declined to intervene in one of the many legal disputes the fence has provoked.)
 The National Guard is leaving the border at the end of the month. And even though the border states want them to stay, the Bush administration is declaring victory. That's how good things are down there.
 Too bad, though, that the results that restrictionists predict from victory -- an end to illegal immigration, the expulsion of illegal immigrants, the restoration of jobs to American workers, the protection of American culture and language from a Hispanic invasion -- are not coming anytime soon. That's because fixing immigration has very little to do with any of the hustle and bustle along the 2,000-mile line from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex. 
 The Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California, San Diego, recently did the radical thing of talking to border-crossers about why and how they come. In a survey of undocumented immigrants from four Mexican states, it found that fewer than half are caught by the Border Patrol. Those who fail the first time try again and again, and their success rates for entering the country hover consistently above 90 percent. Sheriffs, police officers and elected officials in border communities -- some of whom have ridiculed the fence and sued to block it -- would readily confirm that. 
 The study offered another compelling example of enforcement gone awry: reports that illegal immigrants who are stymied by a tighter border are staying put, setting down roots and bringing their families over.
 This is not to argue for giving up on enforcement. The real victory will come when a repaired, well-patrolled border coincides with a repaired, well-run immigration system that requires undocumented workers to come forward and be legalized, has expanded avenues for legal workers, including would-be citizens, and cracks down on illegal hiring as staunchly as it protects workers' rights.
 There is a long list of things to do to make the immigration system correspond to American values and economic realities, and the country is doing just about none of them. We're paying a huge price to pay for an ineffective fence and some symbolic victories on the border.

HEADLINE: Cause For Alarm

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Beaches, barbecues and flags as big as baseball fields. Fireworks as loud as thunder lighting the nighttime sky. Hot fun, as Sly & the Family Stone would say, in the summertime.
 Friday was the 232nd anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. Celebrations were ubiquitous. HBO offered a marathon telecast of its John Adams series. Bands of wildly varying quality, from one coast to the other, let loose with ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' ''America the Beautiful'' and ''The Stars and Stripes Forever.'' 
 It was a July Fourth like many others. There was nothing overt to signal anything was wrong. The Red Sox had traveled from Boston to play a weekend series against the Yankees in the Bronx. In Washington, the National Independence Day Parade made its way along Constitution Avenue. 
 And yet, there was an undercurrent of anxiety in the land. Vacations have been curtailed because of the price of fuel. Since the holiday fell on a Friday, the monthly unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were released a day early, on Thursday. They weren't good. The Times summed things up with a Page 1 headline:
 ''Outlook Darker as Jobs Are Lost and Wages Stall.''
 The high and the low were being buffeted. The bad news bears were loose on Wall Street, and the prospects for the summer employment of teenagers were abysmal. The national employment rate for teens in June was the lowest in 60 years.
 But the anxiety seems more intense than the usual concern for a cyclical economic downturn. Something fundamental seems to have gone haywire. David Boren, a former U.S. senator who is now president of the University of Oklahoma, has written a short book that he called, ''A Letter to America.''
 His sense of alarm in the opening paragraph could not have been clearer. ''The country we love is in trouble,'' he said. ''In truth, we are in grave danger of declining as a nation. If we do not act quickly, that decline will become dramatic.''
 I couldn't agree more. The symbols of patriotism -- bumper stickers and those flags the size of baseball fields -- have taken the place of the hard work and sacrifice required to keep a great nation great.
 You know that matters have gotten out of hand when, as we learned this week, American instructors at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, gave classes on torture techniques used by the Communists to extract false testimony from American prisoners during the Korean War.
 Talk about defining deviancy down! As Al Gore reminds us, this is the first time in American history that ''the executive branch of the government has not only condoned but actively promoted the treatment of captives in wartime that clearly involves torture, thus overturning a prohibition established by Gen. George Washington during the Revolutionary War.''
 There are signs galore of the nation's turn for the worse. We are fighting a debilitating war in Iraq without any idea of how to pay for it -- or how to end it. No one has any real idea about how to cope with the devastating energy crisis, or how to turn the economy around.
 The airline industry is a first-class mess and the knees of the General Motors colossus have buckled. Locks are being changed on foreclosed homes across the country and working families lucky enough to meet their mortgages are watching the value of their homes decline.
 We can build spectacular new stadiums for football and baseball teams (the Yanks, the Mets, the Giants and the Jets are all getting ready to move into staggeringly expensive new homes) but we can't rebuild New Orleans or reconstruct the World Trade Center site destroyed almost seven years ago.
 This year's presidential election is the perfect opportunity to place the truth before the American public in the form of a realistic examination of the state of the nation, and an honest consideration of creative ideas for moving forward. Instead, we're getting hour after hour and day after day of trivia: Who's up? Who's down? Who's patriotic? Who's not?
 Mr. Boren believes that the combination of unrestrained partisanship and the corrosive influence of big money have all but paralyzed the political process. He worries about the neglect of the nation's infrastructure, about the growing divide between the very wealthy and everyone else, and about ''the catastrophic drop in the way the rest of the world views us.''
 The U.S., with its enormous economic and military power, is still better-positioned than any other country to set the standards for the 21st century. But that power and leadership potential were not granted by divine right and cannot be wasted indefinitely.
 Patriotism has its place. But waving a flag is never a good substitute for serious thought and rolling up one's sleeves.

HEADLINE: Shares Decline in Japan For 12th Consecutive Day

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
European markets fell and Asian markets were mixed Friday as investors digested uneven readings on the United States economy and oil prices remained near records. Japan posted its 12th consecutive day of losses.
 Trading was subdued as American financial markets were closed for the Fourth of July holiday.
 In Europe, the FTSE 100 in Britain closed down 1.16 percent at 5,412.80, the DAX in Germany fell 1.28 percent to 6,272.21 and the CAC-40 in France slid 1.8 percent to 4,266. 
 In Asia, Indonesia's main index rebounded after selling off nearly 4 percent on Thursday. Hong Kong and Australian equities were also higher.
 With stocks hit hard recently, some Asian investors were returning to the market to take advantage of lower prices. Others who bet on falling prices were starting to take profits, further supporting prices.
 ''Investors are still bearish. We've been down a lot in the past few weeks. But even those bears are a bit hesitant on selling at this level,'' said Y. K. Chan, fund manager at Phillip Capital Management in Hong Kong.
 Markets in Japan, China, South Korea and Malaysia lost ground.
 The market climate in Europe is ''a bit morose anyway'' because of the high price of oil and the credit squeeze, said Andrew Bell, head of research at Rensburg Sheppards, an investment management company in Britain.
 While in the first quarter of the year, ''people were genuinely panicking because they didn't feel confident in the banking system,'' Mr. Bell said, investors no longer fear ''the whole system unraveling.''
 ''But that doesn't stop the markets falling because company earnings are being squeezed by rising costs, weaker economic growth and tighter credit,'' he said.
 On Friday, shares of the Swiss bank UBS rose after the company said it expected second-quarter results to break even or fall slightly short because of a tax credit that would offset investment losses. It said it would not need to seek capital for a third time this year. Analysts expected a second-quarter loss of as much as $4.9 billion.
 Investors got little guidance from the United States overnight after a mixed assessment on the country's economy. While the nation's service sector shrank, a tame jobs report eased some worries about the labor market.
 Oil prices slipped toward $144 a barrel in electronic trading in Europe. The contract hit a record high at $145.29 a barrel Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 0.2 percent to 13,237.89 points. The index has shed more than 8 percent of its value over the 12-day fall -- the longest losing streak since it stumbled 15 consecutive sessions in 1954.
 The market was dragged down by real estate companies, paper makers, retailers and power companies.
 Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng index climbed nearly 0.9 percent to 21,423.82 points.
 Financials helped lift the market amid reports that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's biggest lender, expected net profit to rise 50 percent in the first half. 
 Telecommunications companies, viewed by some analysts as a safer play during periods of high inflation, rose. The China Netcom Group was up almost 4 percent and China Unicom gained 2.1 percent.
 Hong Kong rose despite weakness in mainland China, where the key Shanghai index skidded 1.2 percent to 2,669.89 points.
 Chinese coal shares fell on fears of a possible coal resource tax revenue plan, which could be announced this weekend.
 Most institutional investors remain worried about the big picture, said Fan Zejie, an analyst for Shanghai Leading Investment and Consulting.
 ''There are too many uncertainties in the next half-year, like inflationary pressures brought by natural disasters, the management of nontradeable shares and the high production prices of raw materials,'' Mr. Fan said.

 IN PARIS, FREED CAPTIVE
 Details Jungle Suffering
 Ingrid Betancourt, returning to Paris, shared some painful details of her six years held in captivity in the Colombian jungle. Her guerrilla captors chained her day and night for the first three years, she said, and they fell into ''diabolical behavior'' that she said ''was so monstrous I think they themselves were disgusted.'' She called her rescue ''a miracle of the Virgin Mary'' and said, ''You need tremendous spirituality to stop yourself falling into the abyss.'' PAGE A7
 CLAIM OF ARMY COMPLICITY
 Pakistan gave centrifuges to North Korea in a 2000 shipment supervised by the army during the regime of President Pervez Musharraf, said Abdul Qadeer Khan, the architect of Pakistan's nuclear program. Dr. Khan said in a telephone interview that the uranium enrichment equipment was sent from Pakistan in a North Korean plane loaded under the supervision of Pakistani security officials. PAGE A6 
 BLAST IN BELARUS INJURES DOZENS
 A bomb exploded during an outdoor concert in the Belarus capital, Minsk, wounding dozens, and a second device was found later in the same area. The blast occurred at about 1 a.m. as revelers were celebrating the country's Independence Day, which commemorates the Soviet Army's liberation of Belarus from the Nazis in 1944. A police spokesman said investigators considered the bombing ''an act of hooliganism.'' PAGE A6
 COURT APPEARANCE ON WAR CRIMES
 Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former vice president and still a senator in Congo, made his first appearance in court in The Hague, accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity while fighting in the Central African Republic. During the hearing, Mr. Bemba was not asked to enter a plea, but he has denied the charges. PAGE A5
 INDIA STRUGGLES ON NUCLEAR DEAL
 India's governing Congress Party was on the verge of replacing its leftist allies, led by the Communist Party, with a coalition led by a North Indian socialist party, in an effort to push through a controversial nuclear deal with the United States. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hopes to firm up support for the deal before Monday's start of the Group of 8 meeting in Japan. PAGE A6
 A PROPHET IN HIS OWN COUNTRY
 The former guerilla fighter Ahmed Rashid has proved to be something of a prophet of Afghanistan, Central Asia and his homeland, Pakistan, though mostly of the Cassandra type, ignored by policy makers. The central argument in his latest book is not original, but it has proven popular: The money and blood spent on Iraq should have been invested in Afghanistan, rebuilding it to prevent the resurgence of the Taliban.

 A WOMAN'S BODY CAUGHT 
 Between Segregated Cemeteries
 Even after death, race remains a delicate issue. Black leaders in Waller County, Tex., say white county authorities sabotaged their efforts to bury a white woman's unidentified body in a black cemetery in order to break the color barrier in the region's public cemeteries. PAGE A9
 VOTE FOR SALE. SERIOUS OFFERS ONLY.
 How much could a Minnesota college student earn by selling his vote this November on the auction Web site eBay? The sale may get the student up to five years' imprisonment and a $10,000 fine under an 1893 Minnesota law that criminalizes the sale of votes. Or, more likely, community service, said Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney. PAGE A9
 HOW CLOSE IS TOO CLOSE?
 The White House and John McCain's campaign are struggling with that question in how to choreograph President Bush's appearance at the Republican convention eight weeks from now. If Mr. McCain appears too close to the sitting president, centrist voters who are ready to turn the page on the last eight years may become alienated. But, if Mr. McCain appears to disrespect Mr. Bush, the Republican base, who are still mostly supportive of Mr. Bush, may stay home in November. PAGE A10
 A LIFE WITH CLOCKS
 ''Clocks are second to my wife, and I mean that,'' said Robert Coffin, who is among a dwindling number of craftsmen who repair antique wooden clocks. The work requires patience and painstaking skill, including an ability to replicate wooden pieces that have not been manufactured for centuries. PAGE A11
 OBAMA CELEBRATES THE FOURTH
 With the Fourth of July political terrain to himself on Friday, Senator Barack Obama urged voters at an Independence Day celebration in Butte, Mont., to support his presidential bid if they want to end the war in Iraq. Mr. Obama was joined by his wife and two daughters as he concluded his five-day tour of Republican-leaning states that was part of his effort to expand the roster of competitive states in his race with Senator John McCain. PAGE A10
 BUSH WELCOMES 72 NEW CITIZENS
 On his last Fourth of July in office, President Bush welcomed 72 men and women on Friday as they prepared to take the oath of citizenship at the annual Independence Day ceremony at Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. His remarks were interrupted at several points by protesters. As members of the audience of about 3,000 urged the demonstrators to be quiet, Mr. Bush addressed the disturbances, saying, ''We believe in free speech in the United States of America.'' PAGE A10

 PARK SERVICE GROWS CLOSER
 To Full Lady Liberty Access
 The National Park Service is inching closer to reopening the Statue of Liberty's crown for the first time since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, by seeking ways to make it safer for visitors to evacuate in the case of an emergency. For now the crown is accessible only by a narrow, double-helix spiral staircase that is not in compliance with federal, state or city fire and building codes. PAGE A15
 QUESTIONS FOLLOW MODEL'S DEATH
 The death last Saturday of the 20-year-old Russian model Ruslana Korshunova, ruled a suicide, has again focused attention on an industry already riddled with tales of young women succumbing to depression, anorexia and drugs while living opulent and edgy lives. But many people in the industry say the image has little to do with reality. PAGE A15
 OUTCRY OVER OBAMA
 Senator Barack Obama made an effort on Tuesday to reclaim the idea of partnerships between government and grass-roots religious groups for Democrats, citing his own community service and initiatives supported by President Bill Clinton and Al Gore even before President Bush's promise to ''rally the armies of compassion.'' Peter Steinfels writes in Beliefs that ''except for six little words he did a very smooth job.'' PAGE A15

 ACTING LIKE A TOUR WINNER
 In the Hope It Comes True
 Cadel Evans has never worn the race leader's yellow jersey at the Tour de France, but he has already adopted the trappings of a winner. His team has hired Lance Armstrong's former bodyguard and its own chef to avoid bland hotel meals. Most important, his teammates have been put on notice that they have but one job during July -- getting Evans to the finish line in Paris in first place. PAGE B12
 WINNING AND DISPELLING MYTHS
 In less than 22 seconds, Cullen Jones dispelled two misconceptions. One is that the 50-meter freestyle swim is devoid of any strategy except getting to the wall first. The other is that African-Americans cannot excel at swimming. PAGE B12 
 AN OLYMPIC DREAM COME TRUE
 Dara Torres's dream to make the 2008 Olympic swim, her fifth, culminated with a victory over the American-record holder in the 100-meter freestyle, Natalie Coughlin. Torres was timed in 53.78, which was 0.02-seconds slower than her best time. Coughlin, who already made the team in the 200 individual medley, clocked a 53.83. PAGE B9

 MORTGAGE CRISIS GIVES PUSH
 For Credit Card Regulation
 For years, consumer advocates have been pushing for firmer federal control of the credit card industry -- particularly regarding interest rates and fees -- and, in the wake of the mortgage crisis, some significant changes may come by early next year. But the proposed regulations are strongly opposed by the industry, which has long beat back any regulatory constraints. PAGE C1
 COLD COMFORT FOR DISNEY
 They may not sound like the kind of business to brag about, but Disney on Ice, the touring shows with figure skaters dressed as Disney cartoon characters, has quietly grown into an important tool for the Walt Disney Company as it seeks to further exploit its creative franchises and turn young children into Disneyphiles. ''The people who roll their eyes haven't seen the shows,'' says one company executive. PAGE C3
 THE MIDDLE GROUND ON BORROWING
 When word got out about a Visa debit card that allows people to borrow money from their 401(k) accounts, retirement experts could not contain their fury. ''An amazingly dumb idea,'' one said. At least one company does not even allow borrowing against the accounts. But the prudent approach may lie between the two extremes. PAGE C1

 HOPING TO MAKE 'THE FLY'
 Fly Anew as an Opera
 Howard Shore, who wrote the score for the 1986 science-fiction horror film ''The Fly,'' says that he ''always thought it to be a classical opera theme, a great story of love and death, of true love that survives physical decay and the ultimate sacrifice.'' And now ''The Fly'' is an opera, written by Howard Shore, and it had its debut this week in Paris. The audience was kinder than critics. PAGE B1

HEADLINE: India Leader Seeks Allies To Support Nuclear Pact

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
India's governing Congress Party was on the verge of swapping allies on Friday in a last-ditch effort to push through a nuclear deal with the United States. 
 The Congress Party was on the brink of replacing its leftist allies, led by the Communist Party, with a coalition led by the Samajwadi, a North Indian socialist party. The Congress Party's grip on India is weakening as inflation and fuel prices rise and the economy slows, and securing an ally is crucial to staying in power. 
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has been a staunch supporter of the nuclear agreement with the United States, has been rushing to firm up support for the deal in India ahead of the Group of 8 summit meeting in Japan, which starts on Monday. 
 There, he is expected to meet with President Bush to discuss the arrangement, which would grant India access to American nuclear technology and atomic fuel in exchange for agreeing to international inspections of its reactors. 
 The proposal has dominated headlines and fueled heavy debate almost since it was put forward in 2005. Critics, including the Communist Party, say the deal ties India's future foreign and energy policy too closely to the United States, but advocates say it could usher in a new era of nuclear power in India, freeing the country from heavy dependence on fossil fuels. 
 American companies have been lobbying heavily for the deal, hoping to sell nuclear power-related equipment to India. 
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, the founder and chief of the Samajwadi Party, told reporters early Friday that Mr. Singh's explanation of the proposal was ''satisfactory,'' signaling that his party could support it. As of Friday evening, the Samajwadi Party had not officially agreed to support Congress or the nuclear deal, but its backing was widely expected. 
 If Mr. Singh's Congress Party fails to secure Samajwadi's support, it will probably be forced to call early elections, in which it is expected to lose many representatives in Parliament because of growing concerns over inflation and high oil prices. Samajwadi has 39 seats in Parliament, while the Congress Party's former Communist allies have 59. Congress needs 44 seats to retain its majority. 
 Mr. Yadav, the Samajwadi leader, has pushed for the rights of farmers and the underclass and favors limiting the use of the English language in government. The party, based in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, is made up mainly of Muslims and farmers. 
 Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of New York, who arrived in New Delhi on Thursday, said he expected that Mr. Singh would arrive at the Group of 8 meeting with the deal in hand. 
 Mr. Ackerman, chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, said in an interview that Indian officials had told him necessary approval of the agreement by the International Atomic Energy Agency was ''basically a done deal.'' 
 Still, time is quickly running out for India's divided political parties to come together, he said. The latest that the deal can be sealed is now, he said. 
 Asked if there is time to push the deal through the United States Congress before Mr. Bush leaves office, he said: ''Possible? Yes. Probable? No.'' 
 If the Indian government wins approval by international regulators by August, the United States Congress could vote on the deal soon thereafter, he said. The current Congress is lined up to vote favorably, he said, and he urged the Indian government to take advantage of the situation. 
 ''I came here because we are hopeful,'' he said, and the Indian government is ''concerned.''

HEADLINE: In Costly Cancer Drug, Hope and a Dilemma

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA and ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
It took only an instant for 58-year-old Gailanne Reeh to go from the picture of health to death's door. By chance, her doctor noticed a lump under her arm during a routine exam. It turned out to be advanced breast cancer. 
 Soon she was having tests to reveal the extent of the cancer and hearing the grim results. 
 The surgeon, she recalled, ''looked at me and said: 'This is not a conversation I like to have. But I can't do anything for you. You can't be cured. You can't be treated. All we can do is manage your cancer.' '' On scans to detect tumors, the doctor told Ms. Reeh, ''you light up like a Christmas tree.''
 And so, like many others in that situation, Ms. Reeh, the vivacious owner of a staffing agency in Boston, was given bevacizumab, also known as Avastin, a drug that signifies both the hopes and dilemmas of modern medicine. 
 Looked at one way, Avastin, made by Genentech, is a wonder drug. Approved for patients with advanced lung, colon or breast cancer, it cuts off tumors' blood supply, an idea that has tantalized science for decades. And despite its price, which can reach $100,000 a year, Avastin has become one of the most popular cancer drugs in the world, with sales last year of about $3.5 billion, $2.3 billion of that in the United States. 
 But there is another side to Avastin. Studies show the drug prolongs life by only a few months, if that. And some newer studies suggest the drug might be less effective against cancer than the Food and Drug Administration had understood when the agency approved its uses. 
 While many patients and their doctors say the drug can improve the quality of life -- like a sense of well-being and an ability to carry out daily tasks without exhaustion or pain -- such effects can be hard to document. Meanwhile, many patients with cancers other than those of the colon, lung or breast are taking the drug, even in cases where there is no compelling evidence that it can help. 
 Avastin also has serious, if infrequent, side effects, some of which can be lethal. And because it is almost always used with standard chemotherapy -- it did not work as well when researchers tried it alone -- patients on Avastin do not escape chemotherapy's side effects. 
 ''I still use Avastin routinely, but it's sobering,'' Dr. Leonard Saltz, a colon cancer specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said of the new data. ''It's not a slam dunk and, in fact, the incremental benefit may be more modest than we want to admit.''
 If Avastin were inexpensive or if it cured cancer or even held it at bay, as the drug Gleevec does for blood cancer, few might care. But like a half-dozen or so new biotechnology drugs with a similar combination -- alluring promise, high price and only arguable benefits -- Avastin raises troubling questions: 
 What does it mean to say an expensive drug works? Is slowing the growth of tumors enough if life is not significantly prolonged or improved? How much evidence must there be before billions of dollars are spent on a drug? Who decides? When, if ever, should cost come into the equation? 
 For a patient like Ms. Reeh, fighting for her life, the cost is not the main concern. If her insurer did not pay, she said, she would go into debt, find a way to raise the money.
 But some in the pharmaceutical industry worry that such prices will raise concerns about whether the drugs are worth it, leading to a backlash like price controls or restrictions on use. 
 Roy Vagelos, a former chief executive of Merck who is considered an elder statesman of the industry, said in a recent speech that he was troubled by a drug, which he would not name but which was a clear reference to Avastin, that costs $50,000 a year and adds four months of life. ''There is a shocking disparity between value and price,'' he said, ''and it's not sustainable.''
 Some patient advocates are also troubled by very expensive treatments like Avastin coming into routine use on what they see as little more than a hope and an expensive prayer. 
 ''It's absolutely critical that we start having a public discussion,'' said Barbara Brenner, executive director of Breast Cancer Action, an advocacy group. ''I think of Avastin as a model that is showing us where the problem is.'' 
 The Rising Cost
 The problem is largely one of cost.
 Cancer drugs constitute the second biggest category of drugs in the United States behind cholesterol-lowering medicines, and accounted for $17.8 billion of total prescription drug sales of $286.5 billion in 2007, according to IMS Health, a health care information company. Spending on drugs for cancer grew 14 percent last year, faster than for all but three other diseases. 
 About 100,000 Americans take Avastin, according to Genentech's data. The drug is being formally tested in as many as 450 clinical trials for about 30 types of cancer. And Genentech, its partner Roche and the National Cancer Institute are now starting studies that will include more than 26,000 people with lung, colon or breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease than were studied initially. If Avastin is approved for those earlier-stage patient groups, it could have a major impact in delaying the return of their cancer, but hundreds of thousands of additional people could end up taking it, possibly for years. 
 And that, insurers and patient advocates say, could impose a considerable financial burden.
 The drug's price, as charged by Genentech, can be $4,000 to more than $9,000 a month, depending on a patient's weight and the type of cancer. Avastin's cost to patients and insurers can be much higher, though, because doctors and hospitals buy the drug and then sell it to patients or their insurers, often marking up the price. So the $2.3 billion that Genentech recorded in sales of Avastin represents only part of what Americans spent on the drug last year. 
 And while doctors typically want the best for their patients, there also are other factors that may push them to prescribe Avastin.
 ''Think about where the interests are aligned,'' said Dr. Deborah Schrag, a colon cancer specialist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ''Patients who seek out cancer care are often quite willing to try all kinds of things. Doctors want to help them and may be financially incentivized. And it is often quite hard for insurance companies to intervene.''
 Medicare requires that the doctor or hospital buying Avastin be paid an amount equal to Genentech's average selling price plus a markup of 5 to 6 percent. Of that amount, Medicare pays 80 percent and the patient pays 20 percent. Doctors and hospitals typically do not make much money on Avastin for Medicare patients, and can even lose money if they buy the drug at a price that is higher than average. But patients can end up paying thousands of dollars a month. Some have supplemental insurance to take care of it; others do not.
 But private insurers sometimes pay several times as much as Medicare pays for Avastin. Doctors and hospitals have at times charged as much as $35,000 a month for the drug, said Dr. Peter Dumich, who reviews claims for cancer patients for AWAC, a company that helps employers contain health care costs. The insurers have little choice, Dr. Dumich says, when their contracts say they must pay a portion, like 80 percent of the charge, whatever the charge actually is. ''Providers have them over a barrel,'' he said. 
 And, like Medicare, private insurers may in turn require patients to pay a percentage of what can be hefty bills. 
 That has happened to Jim Lemieux, a colon cancer patient at Dana-Farber. His private insurance requires that he pay 25 percent of the cost of his treatment, which includes Avastin. His insurer, he said, is charged $6,000 a month for the drug, making his share $1,500. 
 Mr. Lemieux, who was a sales manager at a car dealership, says he cannot bear to look at his medical bills. They include bills for hospitalizations and surgery and co-payments for standard chemotherapy, as well as Avastin.
 To try to make ends meet, he and his wife just sold their house and are moving into their son's basement. Even so, he says, he expects he will have to file for bankruptcy. 
 ''You figure you've got insurance,'' Mr. Lemieux said. ''I paid 30 years and never got sick. I should have just paid the money to myself.'' 
 But he is not planning to give up Avastin.
 ''I'm trying to stay alive,'' Mr. Lemieux said. ''I decided I'm not going to die from Stage 4 colon cancer.''
 A Promising Dream
 When Napoleone Ferrara was hired by Genentech in 1988, he was assigned to work on a drug to ease labor during childbirth. But he could not get cow pituitary glands out of his mind. 
 Dr. Ferrara had noticed in his previous academic job that when he mixed extracts from the glands with cells from blood vessels, the vessel cells started to grow rapidly. Something made by those glands, he reasoned, could spur vessel growth. He found that substance in 1989 and called it vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF (pronounced VEJ-eff). He even isolated its gene. And that led to a new idea for a cancer drug. 
 It drew from a hypothesis for a sort of universal cancer treatment, advanced by the late Dr. Judah Folkman of Harvard. Dr. Folkman had argued, starting in 1971, that tumors must grow their own blood vessels to bring them nourishment and oxygen. If you could choke off those vessels, Dr. Folkman said, you could halt cancers. 
 Dr. Ferrara and his colleagues realized that if they could block VEGF, cancer cells might not be able to grow blood vessels. So Genentech developed a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein, that would bind to VEGF and disable it. In 1997, the company began testing its antibody, which became Avastin, in cancer patients. 
 There were some setbacks. Avastin failed in its first big clinical trial, against very advanced breast cancer. Genentech's stock dropped 10 percent in one day, and some analysts questioned whether the company's investment would ever pay off. 
 Meanwhile, the company was well into a trial of Avastin for colorectal cancer. Patients got chemotherapy plus either Avastin or a placebo. The Avastin patients lived more than four months longer, a median of 20.3 months, compared with 15.6 months for the other group. ''We were excited,'' Dr. Schrag said. ''Four months is big.''
 In February 2004, 15 years after Dr. Ferrara's initial discovery, the Food and Drug Administration approved Avastin for patients with advanced colon cancer. A blockbuster was born. 
 But now there is a question mark over that evidence. That first exciting result compared Avastin with a type of chemotherapy that has since been widely replaced by a more effective regimen. 
 In a later, larger study comparing Avastin with current chemotherapy, Avastin slowed the growth of tumors but did not extend life by an amount considered statistically significant.
 Dr. Schrag said she would continue to give the drug to her colon cancer patients. But when she talks to patients about Avastin now, she said, she will add a few more caveats. 
 She believes that some patients are helped -- that they may feel better and, she hopes, may even, in some cases, live longer. She says a few of her Avastin patients lived several years and some are still alive. Of course, she acknowledges, there is no proof that Avastin was responsible, but it is stories like those that give her, and patients, hope.
 ''All patients want to be the tail end of the survival curve,'' Dr. Schrag said. 
 When Avastin was approved for colon cancer, Genentech decided to charge $2,200 for an average dose, taken every two weeks. That was a reflection of the research and development it had put into the drug as well as continuing research, said Walter Moore, the company's director of government relations. 
 Genentech, which has never before revealed what it spent to develop Avastin, now says that it and its partner Roche have spent more than $2.25 billion starting with Dr. Ferrara's original work. The figure includes research, clinical trials and filing for regulatory approval and is well beyond what was spent by the federal government, which conducted important clinical trials of Avastin. Through May 2006, the government had spent $44.6 million on Avastin trials and related laboratory work, according to figures obtained from the National Cancer Institute by Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group.
 While it is impossible to compare directly the company's investment to the costs of developing other cancer drugs, the amount Genentech says it spent is ''on the high side'' of the industry average, said Henry Grabowski, a professor of economics at Duke University who has analyzed drug development costs.
 Genentech says it and Roche -- which owns a majority of Genentech and markets Avastin outside the United States -- will spend an additional $1 billion testing Avastin as a treatment for early-stage cancers. 
 The price also reflected Genentech's perceived value of the drug compared with other cancer treatments. The price was half that of Erbitux, a colon cancer drug from ImClone Systems and Bristol-Myers Squibb that was approved the same month as Avastin and had not been shown to prolong life. 
 But Avastin is typically used for a longer time and by more patients than Erbitux. And the Avastin dose for lung and breast cancer is twice that for colon cancer, doubling the price. 
 Eric Schmidt, an analyst at Cowen and Company, said pharmaceutical companies typically based drug prices on what the market could bear. 
 ''It's high because Genentech can price it high,'' he said, noting that Avastin's price was in line with that of some other cancer drugs. Despite the company's research and development costs, Mr. Schmidt said, Genentech is one of the most profitable of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 
 Other countries have different views about whether Avastin is worth its price. An institute that advises the British government on which drugs to pay for recommended against it, saying that the drug was not cost effective based on its cost per year of life extended. 
 In the United States, Genentech argues that it puts patients first, with free drugs for those who have no way to pay for them and donations to charities that can help with payments. It also capped the price for a year's supply of Avastin at $55,000 (not counting markups by doctors and hospitals) for patients with incomes of less than $100,000 a year.
 But progress against cancer has a price, the company says. 
 ''The quest is to eliminate the disease,'' Arthur D. Levinson, Genentech's chief executive, said at an annual investor meeting. ''And, yes, there is going to be a cost to that.''
 Of Dubious Benefit
 After colon cancer, the next target was lung cancer.
 Dr. Bruce Johnson of Dana-Farber knew the difficulties well. He had been at the National Cancer Institute, where he reviewed 25 years' worth of clinical trials, 30 studies that started with high hopes and ended with little progress. He used to give talks quoting a World War I general: ''Ground gain minimal. Casualties huge. Conclusion -- press on.'' 
 Avastin, in that context, looked like something of a triumph. Patients who took it along with standard chemotherapy survived for a median of 12.3 months, compared with 10.3 months for those getting only chemotherapy. The results were announced in 2005. ''Finally,'' Dr. Johnson said, ''something worked.'' 
 But as with colon cancer, a newer study adding Avastin to a different chemotherapy regimen has raised questions about its effectiveness against lung cancer. The study's Avastin patients lived no longer than those who got the chemotherapy plus placebo. Although the drug did slow the median time until progression of tumors, the difference was less than a month. 
 The third approval for Avastin, for advanced breast cancer, came in February of this year. The clinical trial found it significantly slowed the progression of cancer but did not significantly extend life. The F.D.A. went against its own panel of outside experts, who had voted 5 to 4 against approval. 
 The agency's action has not sat well. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, asked the Government Accountability Office to look into the F.D.A.'s approval of Avastin and some other drugs that ''appear to have little to no effect in protecting lives and increasing health.''
 Dr. Lee Newcomer, an oncologist and executive at the insurer United HealthCare, said patients were not well served, and neither were insurers, nor the public, which ultimately foots the bill. If a drug just stops tumor progression, without the woman's living longer or feeling better, without her noticing anything different, Dr. Newcomer said, ''you're treating an X-ray.'' 
 Patient advocacy groups were split. 
 ''Even when these drugs 'work,' what kind of impact are you talking about?'' said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, which opposed approval. ''But we market them and give them to everybody.'' 
 Yet other doctors and advocates for patients say that when tumors grow, patients can notice new or worsening symptoms. And they certainly experience greater anxiety. 
 Dr. Kathy Albain, a breast cancer specialist at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill., polled colleagues and patients and found overwhelming support for approving drugs based on delaying tumor progression. It would be ideal to show that a drug also prolongs life, but that may not be realistic, she said. The reason is that when a woman's cancer progresses, doctors change the drugs they use, hoping to slow the cancer. That dilutes any impact of the first drug -- in this case Avastin. 
 Kay Wissmann, director for government relations at the Breast Cancer Network of Strength, a patient advocacy group, said women should have a choice to use Avastin.
 ''We've got some good evidence about this particular drug,'' she said, ''so maybe we should let the people with metastatic disease have the option of using it.''
 Unapproved Uses
 Then there are patients who cannot wait for evidence that a drug works for their cancer. 
 One patient's husband had no medical training. But he determined through his own literature search that his wife's form of brain cancer produced a lot of VEGF, the very substance Avastin neutralized. So the couple wanted to try Avastin, even though it had never been tested for brain cancer. It was 2004, when the only Avastin approval was for colon cancer.
 They asked the woman's doctor, Dr. Virginia Stark-Vance, to give them the drug. 
 Dr. Stark-Vance, a solo practitioner in Dallas and Fort Worth, was reluctant, worried that Avastin could cause bleeding in the brain. That had happened in one of the earliest clinical trials, when a 29-year-old woman whose liver cancer had spread to her brain collapsed from a hemorrhage while riding her bicycle. 
 Finally, Dr. Stark-Vance agreed on the condition that the woman be hospitalized to receive Avastin, in case there was a brain hemorrhage. Had there been one, Dr. Stark-Vance ''could have lost her license,'' said Dr. Henry Friedman, a brain cancer specialist at Duke.
 Like many others taking Avastin, this woman plunged into the unknown, without the assurance of a clinical trial studying whether the drug worked for her type of cancer. 
 Doctors are free to prescribe Avastin, or any other drug on the market, for unapproved uses, at their discretion. As much as 75 percent of cancer drug use is of this ''off label'' variety, according to an estimate by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a group of big cancer centers. And some doctors say that with patients dying, they simply cannot wait for airtight evidence. 
 ''Of course we want everything to be evidence-based,'' said Dr. Yashar Hirshaut, an oncologist in Manhattan. ''I also like the American flag and apple pie.''
 But, he explained, ''You say, 'This person is dying right here and I need something that will help, and there's a logical construct that I can see how it will help.' ''
 One of his patients, Alice Lichter, has had gastric cancer since 2006. Dr. Hirshaut is throwing the whole arsenal at it, giving her gemcitabine, a drug used for pancreatic cancer, plus virtually every drug approved for colon cancer: Avastin, Erbitux, Eloxatin, irinotecan, 5-FU and leucovorin. Most are not approved for gastric cancer. 
 Once every two to four weeks, Ms. Lichter, 72, flies from her home in Miami and checks into Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, where she undergoes four days of intravenous infusions.
 ''I call Lenox Hill my second home,'' she said. 
 'You Name It, It Got Tried'
 Ms. Lichter, whose cancer appears to have receded, said she never questioned Dr. Hirshaut's judgment. And she has no idea how much her drugs cost because Medicare is paying for them and her supplemental insurance covers her co-payment. Insurers say they are often forced by state laws to pay for cancer drugs not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and Medicare must pay if the drug's use is listed in a compendium, a reference compiled by cancer specialists, whose standards are looser than the F.D.A.'s. 
 Such requirements are one reason about 12 percent of United HealthCare's Avastin patients have cancers other than colon, breast and lung. ''Brain, stomach, pancreas, primary cancers of the liver, bladder, small bowel, larynx, prostate -- you name it, it got tried,'' Dr. Newcomer said. 
 But the anecdotes and evidence from small trials that may seem to justify off-label use sometimes turn out to be misleading. That happened with pancreatic cancer. After patients and doctors decided Avastin had to be helping, cancer researchers themselves conducted a large study. So did Roche. Avastin, both studies concluded, did not prolong life for people with cancer of the pancreas.
 For brain cancer, doctors are encouraged, although they do not really know for sure whether Avastin helps. The brain tumor in Dr. Stark-Vance's patient shrank so much after two infusions of Avastin that the radiologist who performed the brain scans called Dr. Stark-Vance in wonderment. 
 Dr. Stark-Vance began treating more patients. Some insurers paid for the drug. Others, including Medicare and Medicaid, did not. But Dr. Stark-Vance said Genentech agreed to provide the drug free for her patients who could not otherwise pay. 
 As word spread, Dr. Friedman at Duke and Genentech organized studies of a type generally considered less than definitive. There was no control group that took another drug or got a placebo. Everyone got Avastin. Otherwise, no one would enroll in the study, doctors argued. 
 Then the investigators compared the results with what they thought would have happened without Avastin. The patients lived a median of about nine months, about three months longer than the researchers estimate would have been expected. 
 But such comparisons have led scientists seriously astray in the past because the people being treated with a new drug often are very different from previous patients who did not take it and because overall medical care steadily improves. Nonetheless, Genentech has said it planned to apply this year to the F.D.A. for approval for Avastin to treat glioblastoma, the deadliest form of brain cancer. 
 Dr. Stark-Vance said her initial Avastin brain cancer patient broke her hip and had to be taken off the drug because it interfered with wound healing. She eventually died. 
 But by now, even without an F.D.A. approval, ''the whole country'' is using Avastin for glioblastoma, Dr. Friedman said. 
 Better Than Nothing?
 Gailanne Reeh remembers what life was like within a few months of those initial scans, when her cancer began causing terrible symptoms. 
 Her abdomen grew so full of fluid that it was hard to bend to tie her shoes. Bowel movements were difficult, and even lying down was uncomfortable with that huge mass in her abdomen. 
 She says she was chilled by what she recalls her doctor saying: ''There was so much growing so fast in my abdomen and so much in my bowel, it was not a matter of maybe I would get a bowel obstruction. It was when I would get a bowel obstruction,'' Ms. Reeh said. ''And when I got it, there would be nothing anyone could do. I would die.'' 
 To try to stave off such a horrible outcome, her oncologist, Dr. Eric Winer of Dana-Farber, offered to enroll her in a clinical trial comparing Avastin with another new biotech drug. Ms. Reeh was assigned to the group that got Avastin in combination with the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, also known as Taxol. 
 The study closed after six months, but Ms. Reeh continued with her drug regimen, and her insurer is paying. After six months of treatment the fluid in her abdomen was down to just a trace, her tumors were stable or smaller and she felt like her former self again. 
 ''I'm really, really excited,'' she said. 
 Was it the Avastin? 
 Dr. Winer said he did not know, since Taxol can also shrink tumors. It is impossible to draw conclusions from individual patients, he said. Still, he said, ''I think it is quite likely that the combination of Taxol and Avastin improved her odds of having a better quality of life.'' 
 Dr. Winer says that when he is not sitting in front of a patient, he thinks about whether drugs like Avastin are worth it to society. But when facing a seriously ill patient, who, based on clinical trial results, might benefit -- even if only a little -- from Avastin along with chemotherapy, he has to think about his patient's needs.
 ''I can't say, 'Let's not use Avastin; it's a very expensive drug and I am worried about the cost to society,' '' Dr. Winer said.
 And so, Dr. Winer said, the answer you get when you ask whether drugs like Avastin are worth it very much depends on whom you ask. 
 ''A person who hasn't been affected by cancer will say, 'Gee, why should we pay for an expensive treatment that doesn't extend life when we have other needs?' '' Dr. Winer said. 
 A person like Ms. Reeh will have a different response. She does not want to give up Avastin. 
 Last month, she reluctantly stopped taking her drugs for a while because Taxol was injuring the nerves in her feet. But later this month she hopes to resume taking both drugs, or at least Avastin. 
 Ms. Reeh says she knows her cancer may very well kill her eventually. But what is it worth to feel better again? 
 ''It's really about living and not waiting to die,'' she said.
 And what if 5 percent of Avastin patients live a lot longer than they would have without the drug? 
 ''I might be in that 5 percent,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Back to Business

BYLINE: By JOHN D. FERGUSON; as told to PATRICIA R. OLSEN. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I WAS a latchkey kid before the term became popular. Both my parents worked for the federal government. I rode a school bus my first two years of school but then moved to a different school at least two miles away from my home.
 I remember walking home and then riding my bike back and forth. At the time it was no big deal. Having to fend for myself probably helped me strike out on my own later in life. 
 After I graduated from Mississippi State University with an accounting degree, I went to work for I.B.M. in Memphis. I joined in June 1967 and received technical and sales training.
 By the next August I was given a quota and had my salary cut in half because I was supposed to start earning commissions. I didn't sell anything the balance of that year and four months into the following year. 
 I told my boss that maybe I should have pursued accounting, but he encouraged me to keep trying. I ended up with 100 percent of my quota for the remainder of the year and I was No. 2 in my area of specialty, new business, the next year. 
 Four years later, I started my own computer company, Econocom, with another I.B.M. salesman. We got the idea after hearing a colleague complain about the competition. Companies were buying computers at a discount and then marking them up and reselling them to I.B.M. clients. I.B.M. maintained the machines but lost out on the rental business. We thought the concept was a neat idea and struck out on our own to follow those companies' lead.
 We had built up a large inventory when one company decided to leave the industry and sold its inventory at a discount. We had to rebuild the business. 
 I took a sabbatical at 35 and started a job training program in Memphis for kids who might not find jobs after high school. Then I started another company, called Equity Investment, and was also involved in a bank that I had chartered with several friends and colleagues in 1973. In 1989, I became chairman of the bank, and during the downturn of the early 1990s stepped in as chief executive. In 1995 we were able to sell the bank for three times its book value. Don Sundquist, one of the bankers who chartered it, became governor of Tennessee in 1995. He asked me to join his cabinet as commissioner of finance and administration. It was probably the closest thing to being chief operating officer of a state. I had to learn about Medicaid, tax policy, budgets, civil service and government decision-making. 
 Finally I told him I wanted to get back into business. The Corrections Corporation of America was experiencing financial problems and Tom Beasley, one of the founders, asked me to run the company. The bank had given me turnaround experience and the state job had educated me about government decision-making, so I felt well-prepared.
 I try to visit at least 20 of our facilities a year. In 2001, I spent four days in a correctional officer's role. I wore a uniform and did everything these staff members do. I helped inmates. I mopped floors and stood in chow lines. I realized we were not using automation as well as we could, so we developed a sophisticated automated inmate management system, including electronic medical records.
 At the New Mexico Women's Correctional Facility in Grants, N.M., I met a new inmate convicted of a double murder. She was about 20 years old and her sentence was 38 years. She stopped me when I was in her area and told me how much she wanted to start her education in prison, and she cried. I was amazed that she was so motivated. It has stayed with me ever since.

HEADLINE: To Save Fuel, Towns Grease the Wheels

BYLINE: By JIM NORMAN

 BODY:
EVEN though government agencies are exempt from the tax portion of the price of motor fuel, they are feeling the pinch of high fuel costs. Motivated in equal measure by budget considerations, environmental concerns and the desire for American energy independence, a handful of local governments have begun to fuel their vehicles with waste vegetable oil.
 Westchester County, north of New York City, has converted 15 of its vehicles to run on waste vegetable oil, ranging from a garish green Veggie Van used for educational purposes to heavy equipment like a garbage truck and a farm tractor.
 ''This is one of those things that's so much fun to show off,'' Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, said of the Veggie Van, a shuttle van that was converted into a mobile classroom to teach environmental awareness to small groups of students. 
 ''And the old vegetable oil from the county's Glen Island Park would have been thrown down the drain,'' Mr. Spano said, referring to food concessions at the park.
 In addition, county-owned sites like an amusement park in Rye, a restaurant in New Rochelle and hospital and correctional complexes in Valhalla all save their used cooking oil for the county, said Ralph Butler, the Westchester commissioner of public works.
 Not only that, Mr. Butler added, the county has set up three collection sites so restaurant owners can bring their used oil ''and do the right thing instead of the illegal thing'' -- clandestinely dumping the oil. 
 In one recent month, Mr. Butler said, restaurants contributed more than 200 gallons of old cooking oil to the 300 gallons or so that the county gets each month from its own sources. 
 ''We can use all the oil we can get,'' he said. ''We're always looking for more oil, and we have plans to convert even more vehicles. Right now, we're working on a second Veggie Van, because we just can't keep up with demand for the first one.''
 The diesel-fueled vehicles were all converted to run on vegetable oil at a total cost of about $25,000, Mr. Butler said, under contracts with V. O. Tech, a business run by Wally Little, a mechanic-turned-inventor in Mahopac, N.Y. ''It's money well spent,'' Mr. Butler said. ''We expect payback in one to two years.''
 Mr. Butler said tests conducted by the county showed that the vegetable oil burned more cleanly than the diesel fuel that had been used in the vehicles and gave the same power and fuel economy.
 Mr. Spano said he got the idea to run vehicles on vegetable oil when he was eating in a restaurant in the northern part of the county and was commiserating with the owner about the high price of gasoline. The restaurateur, Jon Pratt, mentioned that he was using his cooking oil to run a truck, ''and I thought, 'Why not us?' '' Mr. Spano recalled.
 The idea turned out to be contagious. Valerie M. O'Keeffe, the town superviser in Mamaroneck, said she was in a meeting with Mr. Spano last year and saw the county's Veggie Van. ''I admit I was jealous,'' she said. ''I had to have one for the town. I thought, 'What's bigger and better?' and I came up with the idea of a garbage truck.''
 As a result, she said, mechanics in the Mamaroneck Department of Public Works began converting a 300-horsepower Mack garbage truck that had previously run on diesel fuel.
 The truck has been collecting trash for more than three months, she said, saving the cost of about 40 gallons of diesel a week. She said the town paid about $7,000 to convert the truck and would recoup its money within a year. 
 The county subsequently put its own converted garbage truck on the road.
 Government experimentation with vegetable oil as a motor fuel is not limited to the Northeast. Agencies in California and Florida have also converted vehicles from diesel.
 Craig Dodson, the superintendent of facilities and equipment for the Golden Gate Bridge, said the agency responsible for bridge operations gave him permission to investigate alternative fuels several years ago ''in response to rising fuel prices and California's strict smog requirements.''
 Now, he said, he runs a pool with 24 vehicles -- along with four air compressors -- that use only waste vegetable oil as fuel. The vehicles include 18 Italian scooters that use single-cylinder diesel engines, four tow trucks and two fork-lifts. (The scooters are driven along the 10-foot-wide sidewalk to take workers and materials to work sites along the bridge, he said, so that traffic is not impeded by trucks stopping in the road.)
 Initially, he said, he used a kit from Greasecar.com, a manufacturer in Massachusetts, to convert one scooter, equipping it with separate tanks for pure vegetable oil and a mix of vegetable oil thinned with additives. But all the rest of the scooters run on vegetable oil blended with cetane boosters and other commercially available additives in a single tank. The tow trucks are running on a mix of diesel and vegetable oil, and as they age and get closer to the end of their service life, Mr. Dodson said, he experiments by increasing the vegetable oil component. ''So far,'' he said, ''they are doing just fine with heavier concentrations of vegetable oil.''
 He added, ''We use between 100 and 300 gallons of vegetable oil a week and not a bit of diesel, and it costs us 72 cents a gallon to make it ready to use.'' Moreover, he said, ''whether it's a batch of 50 gallons or 500 gallons, it takes us 40 minutes to do.''
 Like most other agencies and private users of vegetable oil, Mr. Dodson's agency counts on regular collections of oil from restaurants. But unlike other veggie burners, the agency has access to resources like centrifuges salvaged from county buses that were headed for the scrap heap. ''We can use the centrifuges to clean this oil down to one micron, which is extremely fine,'' he said. 
 In Florida, Tim Beyrle, the director of systems operations for the New Smyrna Beach Utilities Commission, which runs the local electric utility, said that a predecessor had converted a 1993 Ford F-Series pickup truck to run on vegetable oil, using a kit from PlantDrive.com, a California-based company. 
 ''But it's not a normal fleet vehicle,'' Mr. Beyrle said. ''We use it as a demonstration vehicle for things like alternative energy fairs, but not much else.'' Mr. Beyrle said he would not convert a second vehicle for his fleet. ''We're an electric utility, not a vegetable oil collector,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Music Festival Plan Divides a Town

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 Here's an idea for an episode of ''The Simpsons.''
 Goliath Entertainment Enterprises decides it wants to hold an annual three-day Woodstock-esque concert for 75,000 people in Springfield! An opportunity for Mr. Burns and the forces of corporate evil to ruin the town; or a chance for Bart to get on stage with Metallica, and Springfield to rake in some big bucks and transcend its image as a one-nuke town? Or both?
 There are many grain silos and dairy cows and no apparent nuclear reactors in this version of Springfield in the lovely rolling hills 60 miles west of Albany near Cooperstown. And Simpsons aficionados know the show once ventured into slightly similar turf in a 1996 episode called ''Homerpalooza,'' inspired by the Lollapalooza concerts, in which Homer tried to bolster his street cred by joining a touring rock festival. 
 Still, there's no shortage of real-world story lines buzzing around this town of 1,300, which recently found out that Madison Square Garden wants to buy 910 acres, now a dairy farm, and spend $15 million to mount what it calls in preliminary documents filed with the town ''an annual world-class, three-day music festival.''
 The goal is for the first show to be held in 2010, with most festivalgoers camping out on the grounds. It would include rock, jazz, pop, blues and folk music, an on-site dance club, theatrical performances, art shows, arcades, an Internet cafe and music on one semipermanent main stage and numerous satellite tents and stages. It's all modeled on multiday events like Coachella in California, Bonnaroo in Tennessee, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Texas.
 ''We've been interested in one of these large, three-day festivals; there's not anything like it in the Northeast,'' said Don Simpson (no relation), senior vice president for business development at MSG Entertainment. ''We started looking into it last fall, looking for a large piece of land that could accommodate everything, and this one was perfect -- beautiful landscape, rolling hills. We fell in love with the site.''
 Garden officials notified the town planning board of their plans on April 28 and have since met with town officials and citizens.
 In this version of Springfield, a victim of the upstate economic malaise, the locals tend to break down into longtime residents, many with ties to agriculture, and second-home types and newcomers who have bought old farms or homes on Otsego Lake. There's no unanimity in either camp, but most of the support is coming from the longtime residents -- who also control the town government. The newcomers (which can mean people not born in town), fresh from fending off turbines for wind energy, tend to be against it. And then there are the Amish, who have bought local farms and kept them alive. They're said to be against it, too.
 There are plenty of questions on all sides, about traffic (Route 20, mostly four lanes, runs into town but local roads are two lanes), noise, sanitation, economic effects, and the other elements that will go into the environmental impact study that is needed to move the project ahead. 
 Proponents, who include the town supervisor, Thomas Armstrong, who is 81 and has had the job since 1991, say, yes, it would be three days of aggravation, but it would leave the land -- already subdivided for single-family homes -- open and unspoiled, bring in badly needed tax revenue and perhaps open the way for more arts-oriented business. 
 He was at KC's Corner Diner, the only restaurant left in town, with the owner, Bruce Hargrove, the other day. Both saw it as a no-brainer. Mr. Hargrove said that since he opened 18 years ago, 45 businesses in town have closed, and school enrollment has tumbled. The town has half as many people as it had a century ago.
 ''Look out there,'' he said, pointing to Route 20, the major east-west artery that runs through the town. ''It's July 3, and you could put a volleyball net up and play in the middle of the road. We're dying here. Something needs to change.''
 Opponents say the concert would bring too much noise and traffic and take prime agricultural land out of production for little gain. 
 ''We came here for peace and quiet; this is not peace and quiet,'' said Robert H. Boyle, founder of the Riverkeeper environmental group, who moved to the town six years ago. ''It's not just three days when you add the time setting it up and taking it down, and those three days could be very turbulent, to say the least. You look at the history of music festivals; they're not gatherings of Eagle Scouts.'' 
 Rosemarie Harrison, who is circulating petitions against the festival (there is also a petition in support), said that residents were against it, but she feared that elected officials would approve it anyway. ''People are tearing the petitions out of my hand to sign it,'' she said. ''It would help a few people and ruin everyone else's lives. It's already dividing the town. It's not even here, and it's already ruining the town.''
 Supporters say much of the opposition is from people who seem to oppose everything, and if people don't like it, they can leave town that one weekend and come back when it's over.
 Another probable no-show, if the concert ever comes off, would be Homer Simpson, who has voiced more aesthetic objections to similar events. Death Cab for Cutie? My Morning Jacket? The rest of the current festival fare? Who needs it?
 As he said back in Homerpalooza: ''Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. It's a scientific fact.''

ORIGINS 
 By Amin Maalouf. 
 Translated by Catherine Temerson. 
 404 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26. 
 The attributes of Arab identity have proved quite a challenge for Americans in the last decade. Throughout the 20th century most United States citizens went along quite happily without expending a thought to, say, the difference between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. This was of a piece with a general climate of nonchalance about all things foreign. In a speech in Brasilia in 1982, Ronald Reagan infamously offered a toast to ''the people of Bolivia,'' a gaffe that probably did him more good than harm on his home turf. Since 9/11, the days of willful ignorance about the Arab world are gone forever, or at least there is a pretense they are. Now, just when it looked as if more or less everyone, politicians included, was close to getting the Sunni-Shiite thing down, along comes Amin Maalouf with his lovely, complex memoir, ''Origins,'' to remind us that Arab identity is as fluid, unsettled and ever-changing as the Mediterranean Sea where it kisses the shores of Lebanon, his country of origin, and France, where he has lived for the last 30 years. 
 Maalouf is a writer of historical fiction (his novel ''The Rock of Tanios'' won the 1993 Prix Goncourt), a sometime opera librettist and a quirky historian -- in ''The Crusades Through Arab Eyes,'' he brilliantly reconstituted a semi-documentary narrative from ''the other side.'' He is also a polemicist on behalf of the mongrel life. His 1998 book ''Les Identites Meurtrieres'' (translated into English two years later as ''In the Name of Identity: Violence and the Need to Belong''), about the vagaries of identity and the dangers in cleaving too hard to the national model, took on a trenchant identity of its own after 9/11. Here was the clear, calm, cogent and persuasive voice from the Arab world that it seemed everyone in the West had been waiting for. In that book, Maalouf argued, like Primo Levi in ''The Periodic Table,'' for the salience of marginalized groups, ''frontier dwellers,'' to the societies they inhabit. By paying attention to the mix and match of minority life, majorities smugly entrenched in fixed identities might be encouraged to get a grip on their own, almost certainly diverse, selves. The dangers of not doing so are clear. ''Those who cannot accept their own diversity may be among the most virulent of those prepared to kill for the sake of identity, attacking those who embody that part of themselves which they would like to see forgotten,'' he wrote. In ''Origins,'' Maalouf puts theory into practice by charting the wayward journey of his own family. 
 The Maalouf family on the cusp and into the first decades of the 20th century is a challenging and charming blend of Catholics, Protestants, open thinkers and Freemasons, and sometimes a satisfyingly incongruent combination of two or more of these affiliations. There is even a Mormon branch in Utah. But the family's allegiance is first and foremost to the mountain villages of Lebanon, and from that unrolls a variety of commitments to place, family, religion, region, state, language, business, poetry and high thought. The Maaloufs are also somewhat taken with the idea of exile as an experience to broaden the mind rather than a loss of home to be endlessly lamented. 
 In ''Origins,'' Maalouf focuses mainly on his grandfather Botros, a schoolteacher who, having failed in business (he wanted to grow tobacco in the Bekaa plain), lives instead ''between notebooks and inkwells''; and on his more successfully entrepreneurial great uncle Gebrayel (his grandfather's younger brother), who left Lebanon in late 1895 for the United States and three years later for Cuba. They are a study in contrasts. Botros, a dandified intellectual determined to bring enlightenment to his corner of the mountains, scandalously refuses to have his children baptized, sets up a ''Universal School'' and roams his village bareheaded in a suit and cape, while Gebrayel establishes a successful retail business in Havana, only to die there under tragic circumstances. 
 Amin Maalouf's forebears include a Melkite priest, Theodoros, and a tragic hunger artist, Botros's unnamed nephew, who starves himself to death because his father will not let him study literature. The memoir is also flecked with delicious family anecdotes: a young aunt unwinds her tresses on her way to bed when her excited father calls out from the kitchen where negotiations have been in progress, ''Zalfa, do up your hair again; we've married you off!'' 
 Why look back? William Blake strongly advised driving your cart and your plough over the bones of the dead, and Maalouf is frequently tempted by the idea as he travels from his home in Paris to fill the gaps in his ancestors' stories. In Cuba, where he locates his great uncle Gebrayel's home and discovers newspaper reports of his death, Maalouf often gets that ''I should have stayed home and watched sports on TV'' feeling, but he persists in his research. The descriptions of his brief sojourn in Havana -- frustrations and impasses followed by an unexpected denouement involving a long-lost cousin -- are the most gripping and evocative chapters in the memoir. In Cuba, Maalouf feels home but not at home. He drinks local rum, invites the Caribbean breeze to caress his face and ruminates on what might have been if his grandfather Botros and not his great uncle Gebrayel had made his way to Havana. Yet in the end, Maalouf doesn't only want to illuminate family history or amplify stories barely whispered for a hundred years; instead, he strives to reveal the fecund variety of his own family, of Arab life and history, of history itself. In doing so, he offers a lesson in the value of impermanence and shifting sands. ''Barely a hundred years ago, Lebanese Christians readily proclaimed themselves Syrian, Syrians looked to Mecca for a king, Jews in the Holy Land called themselves Palestinian ... and my grandfather Botros liked to think of himself as an Ottoman citizen,'' he writes. ''None of the present-day Middle Eastern states existed, and even the term 'Middle East' hadn't been invented. The commonly used term was 'Asian Turkey.' Since then, scores of people have died for allegedly eternal homelands, and many more will die tomorrow.'' 
 Identity is writ not in stone but on water. All the more absurd, then, when it is used -- in a manner increasingly common, especially among our hopeful politicians -- as a credential. Am I, for example, suitably qualified to represent the unemployed in contemporary Poland because my grandfather hailed from Piotrokow more than a century ago and never had a job in his life? 
 In her old age, Amin Maalouf's grandmother Nazeera knitted him a white winter scarf so long that on chilly Paris nights he has to wrap it around his shoulders ''several times so it won't drag on the floor.'' Maalouf wants nothing more than to unwind the long scarf of memory and history, not to make a claim, but in celebration of human dignity, endeavor and ''wanderers who have lost their way.'' He is one of that small handful of writers, like David Grossman and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who are indispensable to us in our current crisis.

HEADLINE: Oil Climbs as Stocks Fall. Sound Familiar?

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
In a pattern that has been repeated for weeks, oil prices rose and the stock market fell. 
 This time, the entire week on Wall Street was constrained to three and a half days of trading because of the Fourth of July holiday, which fell on Friday and shortened trading on Thursday. 
 Oil futures in New York settled on Thursday at $145.29 a barrel, up from $140.21 the previous week. The United States economy shed an additional 62,000 nongovernment jobs in June, the sixth consecutive month of job losses, according to a Labor Department report on Friday.
 General Motors shares dropped 12 percent for the week, the biggest loss among the Dow industrials for the second consecutive week.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.97 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 11,288.54. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 15.48 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 1,262.90. The Nasdaq composite index fell 70.25 points, or 3 percent, to close at 2,245.38. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained flat from the previous week, at 3.97 percent.

 BODY:
THE LAST THOUSAND DAYS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE 
 Churchill, Roosevelt, and the Birth of the Pax Americana. 
 By Peter Clarke. 
 Illustrated. 560 pp. Bloomsbury Press. $35. 
 If it were not for the subtitle of Peter Clarke's sharp new history, ''The Last Thousand Days of the British Empire: Churchill, Roosevelt, and the Birth of the Pax Americana,'' readers could be excused for looking at the book's title and having no idea what period of time was under consideration. Could it be the years leading up to 1997, when the British finally relinquished Hong Kong? Or perhaps the early 1960s, when Nigeria and the crown's beloved Jamaica gained independence? 
 One could even think of 1919, when the British massacred hundreds of Indians in the Punjabi city of Amritsar, as the year marking the beginning of the end. Indeed, the British Empire can be seen as reaching its terminus in almost every decade of the 20th century. What distinguishes the years 1944 to 1947 is that the British retreats in both Palestine and India were hastened by the same Anglo-American alliance that was so successful in vanquishing fascism. 
 World War II presented British imperialists with two intractable problems. American aid may have enabled the British to fend off Hitler, but by 1945 Britain was faced with mounting financial obligations and a greater American military presence throughout the empire. 
 Meanwhile, the Roosevelt administration was intent on turning Churchill's own rhetoric about freedom and liberty against him. As Clarke notes, the United States had a long-standing antipathy to British imperialism, and Roosevelt was concerned that the American public would think ''their boys'' had gone to fight in ''foreign wars for the British Empire.''
 Any honest account of the 1940s requires a relatively cynical appraisal of the ''special relationship'' that is so much a part of both British and (especially) American mythology. Clarke's greatest strength is that he recounts in painful detail the numerous humiliations and embarrassments that came with being the junior partner in a wartime alliance. His description of Churchill's correspondence with Roosevelt is almost moving in its pathos: ''The voluminous correspondence between the two -- it ran to 2,000 communications in five years -- was remarkable, but never enough for Churchill. He wrote eloquently and, above all, frequently to his new friend -- far more frequently than the cool and canny president replied, always careful to keep his distance.'' 
 Britain's need to remain in the good 
 graces of its former colony is most movingly seen in Churchill's receptiveness to Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau's vengeful plan to reduce a conquered Germany to a ''pastoral'' state. ''Subsequently regarded as rather an embarrassment,'' Clarke writes with perhaps too much understatement, the plan was embraced by Churchill because he was relentlessly focused on the terms of Lend-Lease repayments and felt he had no choice.
 Still, even if American anti-imperialism made Britain's predicament worse, the British position in India, which takes up most of the second half of Clarke's book, was becoming increasingly untenable on its own terms. Britain owed India billions of pounds. What's more, the popularity of Gandhi and the Congress Party (led by Jawaharlal Nehru) were obstacles to British rule that could not be overcome. Moreover, as Clarke astutely points out, the concessions toward Indian independence that had already been granted made it nearly impossible to get much economic benefit out of the subcontinent. 
 Churchill made clumsy attempts to find some sort of compromise during the war, but to little avail. At the same time, his rhetorical exertions (he claimed that Indians were ''a beastly people with a beastly religion'') were backed up by policies nothing short of criminal. Gandhi and Nehru were both imprisoned in 1942. The following year a calamitous famine in Bengal left three million people dead. London's indifferent response to this disaster was, in Clarke's word, ''gruesome.''
 When Clement Attlee's Labor government was elected in 1945, it found itself in an impossible situation, despite the fact that the new prime minister and much of his party had (admirably) favored Indian independence for quite some time. Churchill's contempt for Hinduism accurately reflected the sentiments of the British ruling class, which had always been more sympathetic to monotheistic Islam. The problem was that London's policy of divide and rule between Hindus and Muslims had left the Hindu-dominated Congress Party unwilling to compromise and Mohammad Ali Jinnah's Muslim League even more desirous of its own state; the British, in Paul Scott's arresting formulation, were being ''scorched by fires'' they themselves had set.
 Clarke makes clear, however, that Gandhi's decision to ''sabotage'' crucial negotiations in the spring of 1946 robbed all parties involved of the last, best chance for a solution to the Hindu/Muslim question. By the time Lord Mountbatten arrived in the country early in 1947, all he could do was get both sides to agree to partition, and then hastily retreat.
 Clarke is not especially diplomatic in evaluating British diplomacy. Yet his ultimate conclusion that Britain's handling of the subcontinent was ''not as bad'' as the handling of Palestine (on which he spends considerably less time) is much too lenient. Not only did partition cause millions of deaths in 1947 and 1948, but the subsequent and arguably inevitable partition of Pakistan (which gave us Bangladesh) 25 years later was another humanitarian calamity. Meanwhile, Pakistan has had continuing trouble with Islamist extremists, and the nuclear-infused issue of Kashmir is arguably the most dangerous problem on earth. Jinnah, Pakistan's founder, would be equally disturbed to learn that 60 years after partition it is not at all obvious that Pakistan is a better place for Muslims to live than its eastern neighbor.
 ''The Last Thousand Days of the British Empire'' may not have sexy revelations or counterintuitive reappraisals, but Clarke, the author of ''Hope and Glory: Britain 1900-2000'' and other books of British history, is an engaging narrator and a skilled summarizer. His generally anti-imperialist analysis is also made more persuasive by a wistfulness about the empire that will be familiar -- even understandable -- to anyone who has read John Buchan or Ian Fleming or any of the brilliant Indian-born authors writing in English, from Anita Desai and her daughter Kiran to Vikram Seth. 
 Referring to a ''tragic destiny,'' Clarke says ''we simply need to recognize'' that the British people's finest hour in 1940-41 ''left bills to be paid later. Defeat would obviously have spelled the end of the empire. But so did victory.'' Fifteen years after that ''finest hour,'' Dwight Eisenhower told Prime Minister Anthony Eden that if British troops did not pull out of Suez, Eisenhower would cause the collapse of the pound. The Pax Americana had arrived. All of this could, from one point of view, be labeled tragic, but as is so often the case with history, ironic is probably the better word.

AMERICA AMERICA 
 By Ethan Canin. 
 458 pp. Random House. $27. 
 Novelists often bristle when asked to account for what provoked a book to be written. If the reply is a churlish ''for me to know and you to find out,'' who can blame him or her? Being asked to justify a preoccupation is like being grilled about the attractions of a hobby or a sweetheart.
 In the happiest reading experiences, the ''why'' of a novel's being goes without saying: the writer has heard the peculiar music of a singular voice (Portnoy's, let's say) or has indulged the elaboration of an obsession (Humbert Humbert's) or has located the murderous flaw of a conventional wisdom (''Catch-22'') or has confronted the quiddities of a heartbreaking dilemma (''Sophie's Choice''). 
 Unfairly or not, though, some find the ''why'' question irresistible. Halfway through Ethan Canin's lengthy, languidly unfolding new novel, ''America America,'' the narrator is confronted by just such a demand: ''Why are you telling me all this?'' Asking is Trieste Millbury, a 17-year-old intern at a newspaper where the narrator is the publisher, and like the reader, she has by now had an earful from a character who does a heap of talking about a mite of knowing. His answer to her ''Why?'' is ''Why?'' 
 Since the narrator is modest to a fault, lavishing on all riddles and bewilderments variations on ''beats me'' or ''dunno'' or ''your guess is as good as mine,'' let's try to figure out for him why indeed he is telling us all this. Corey Sifter, born to a loving mother and a hard-working plumber in upstate New York, near the shore of Lake Erie an hour south of Buffalo, was witness to calamitous political doings and undoings in 1971 and 1972.
 Yard boy on the estate of Liam Metarey -- himself the son of a low-born Scot robber-baron who built ''Aberdeen West'' on the brutally-got spoils of coal mining and timber cutting -- Corey at 16 and 17 fetches and serves, parks and washes cars. He is also invited to share meals and join the Metarey family on outings aboard the family sailboat and one of its private airplanes. Mrs. Metarey is a stunt pilot. She has two teenage daughters and a son who will die in Vietnam.
 Liam Metarey is a kingmaker, presidential campaign manager for United States Senator Henry Bonwiller, a New York Democrat equipped with a booming baritone and prone to indulging in bromides proclaiming himself a friend to the working man. For reasons not made clear, Corey, with his brand-new driver's license, is frequently trusted to chauffeur the senator, often on ice-slicked country roads and during heavy snowfalls, and he is witness to many events he fails to comprehend.
 Principal among these is the faking of an automobile accident, in which he takes part, to cover up the death by foul play of the married senator's mistress, dead at 26. She has been seduced and abandoned in an orchard near Aberdeen West, suffering from exposure to the cold and a blow to the head. Her name is JoEllen Charney, and the reader would have to be clueless not to connect her sad end to the death on Chappaquiddick in 1969 of Mary Jo Kopechne. But clueless is the rule in ''America America.'' 
 Corey is 50 when he recalls and half-heartedly takes a stab at interpreting in 2006 -- on the occasion of Senator Bonwiller's death -- the events of 1971 and 1972, which ended in the candidate's disgrace owing not as much to his part in JoEllen's death as to financial shenanigans. Liam Metarey, collaterally damaged, kills himself by crashing his wife's biplane into his estate's orchards.
 As the book begins, Corey collects these scandals and shames under the rubric ''something like this'' and soon compresses the complex trauma to ''it'' and ''this.'' The first two pages convey a reluctant witness, interjecting such modifying phrases as ''in a certain manner'' and ''to a certain degree.'' These rhetorical reflexes reveal not the razor-slices of a parser but the mumbles of a know-nothing.
 After all the pages of testimony -- diffident and reliably gullible and unsmiling -- what is Corey's mature judgment of ''it,'' of ''this''? ''That I'd been involved with something -- not that I did something, but that I was involved with something -- something unforgivably wrong.'' Even this much, two pages later, he scruples to dilute: ''But it's also important to say that in all my time at the Metareys' and in the campaign, I never enjoyed more than an outsider's view of the proceedings.'' 
 Ah, the ''outsider's view''! What the outsider apprehends and misapprehends can be great stuff, depending on lighting, angle of vision, field of view, misapprehended idiom, distortions caused by hyper-alertness. This is Fitzgerald country: ''The Great Gatsby'' and especially ''Winter Dreams,'' about a caddy to a tycoon who falls for the tycoon's beautiful daughter. (Liam Metarey has two beautiful daughters, and Corey will marry one of them, about whom he declares after many months in her company, ''I realized I didn't know the first thing about her.'')
 The explicit matter of ''America America'' is social and economic class. The mighty squire plucks a townie from his fate and -- literally -- flies Corey to the clouds. Teaches him -- literally -- the ropes: on a sailboat, which is a sheet and which a line. He pays to send him to boarding school, at Dunleavy, without bothering to ask Corey if he'd like to attend. But how could Corey know? ''You don't know what Dunleavy is, do you?'' Metarey says, discussing his plans for his yard boy. ''No, sir.'' (What Corey is revealed not to know would fill a book. He's still tugging his forelock as a 50-year-old newsman, claiming not to know which of his fellow small-town citizens are Republicans and which are Democrats.)
 If you choose to be guided by this narrator through these events -- proceeding coincidentally with the time of the Vietnam War and Watergate -- you should be alert to Corey's concession that ''I don't know, and I suppose I never will know, exactly what Liam Metarey thought of me, or what I was to him.'' And, more specifically, why exactly Metarey sent Corey to Dunleavy. Here are a couple of possibilities: ''Was he, as I sometimes wonder, trying to make me of a rank with his daughter? Or was it, as I think at other times -- how could I not? -- was it that he was trying to separate me from her?'' 
 ''Liam Metarey remains a mystery to me to this day,'' ''this day'' being the final pages of ''America America.''
 About Dunleavy, the young student had opinions aplenty. If you believe Charles Dickens had bad memories of the blacking factory, you haven't visited Dunleavy school with Corey Sifter. The literature of miserable boarding school experiences has almost generic status; the genre demands its useful conventions and minimum requirements (at least one lovable and one sadistic teacher is to be characterized, and etc., and etc.), dramatizations Canin won't be bothered to create. 
 Many bewilderments about Corey's daily life at Dunleavy will persist. How can he get such good grades there, and play soccer, and at the same time spend his weekends 100 miles distant, doing odd jobs on the estate? Don't ask the narrator; he's the guy who doesn't notice -- ''I'd failed to grasp something,'' that ''the paths were empty'' -- that the school seems suddenly deserted, only to discover that his classmates, ''in their rowdy flocks,'' are singing glee-club-like in a basement. He didn't get the memo. It's a school custom, like knowing port from starboard.
 So, finally, what does Corey want, at novel's end, to tell the reader? ''The old verities, mostly: that love for our children is what sustains us; that people are not what they seem. ... That we never learn the truth. When you've been involved in something like this, when in your memory there's some marauding creature still alive, some fleeting, nightmarish beast always running up behind you, it's in the nature of all of us, I think, to want to turn and see it, no matter how terrible or how mild it might be. But as in the childhood dream, you can't ever really do that.'' 
 Asked and answered, I guess. Gee, thanks!

HEADLINE: PRIME NUMBERS June 29-July 5

 BODY:
THE NUMBER of American and coalition troops who died in Afghanistan last month, the highest monthly toll since the American-led invasion began in 2001.
 BEHIND THE NUMBER The violence is the latest evidence of a strengthening Taliban insurgency that has menaced NATO forces and reclaimed some southern and eastern parts of the country. The death toll spiked even as the number of foreign troops in Afghanistan -- including 32,000 Americans -- approaches its highest level since 2001. But that many not be enough. The former senior commander there, Gen. Dan K. McNeill, last month called Afghanistan an ''under-resourced war.'' 
 THE NUMBER of jobs that disappeared in June, according to the Labor Department, the sixth consecutive month that payrolls have declined. 
 BEHIND THE NUMBER The job losses affected a range of industries, including banks, construction companies, manufacturing firms and car dealerships. The unemployment rate held steady in June at 5.5 percent, the highest in four years, after jumping a half a percentage point in May, the biggest monthly increase in 22 years. Goldman Sachs predicts the unemployment rate will peak at 6.4 percent late next year. ''The labor market is clearly deteriorating, and it's highly likely to keep deteriorating,'' a Goldman economist said. 
 THE NUMBER of years spent in the United States Senate by Jesse Helms, the powerful Republican from North Carolina who died Friday at the age of 86.
 BEHIND THE NUMBER Mr. Helms's courtly manner barely concealed a hard-edged conservatism that opposed civil rights, gay rights, foreign aid and modern art. He became a beacon for the right wing of American politics, a lightning rod for the left, and, often, a mighty pain for presidents whatever their political leaning. ''I didn't come to Washington to be a yes man for any president, Democrat or Republican,'' he once said. ''I didn't come to Washington to get along and win any popularity contests.'' 
 THE PERCENTAGE decline in sales last month of new cars and trucks, which plunged to their lowest level in more than a decade.
 BEHIND THE NUMBER Record-high gas prices and the housing slump contributed to the drop in sales, particularly of the largest and most profitable vehicles. Sales fell by double digits for all major automakers but Honda. The company's lineup of small cars helped its United States sales climb to a record for a second consecutive month. The three Detroit automakers now plan to cut significantly production of trucks and build more passenger cars. ''This too shall pass,'' said one auto executive. ''When it does, we want to be prepared.''
 THE NUMBER of exterminators, approximately, who have been sent to battle a locust infestation in northern China in hopes of heading off a migration to Beijing during the Olympics.
 BEHIND THE NUMBER What else can go wrong for Chinese Olympic officials? There was the uprising in Tibet. The earthquake. Beijing's choking air pollution. The massive algal bloom that threatens the Olympic sailing competition in Qingdao. So why not a plague of locusts? Mongolian herdsmen will assist the army of exterminators by sending their chickens into the thick of it. One herdswoman explained that her 50-odd chickens could eat more than 100 locusts a day. Let the games begin.

HOUSE OF WITS 
 An Intimate Portrait of the James Family. 
 By Paul Fisher. 
 Illustrated. 693 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $35. 
 ''House of Wits'' seems an odd title, suggesting elegant repartee and playful badinage -- more Oscar Wilde or Noel Coward -- for what is billed as an ''intimate portrait'' of the James family. Certainly they could be witty (Alice, the only daughter, was especially sharp); they competed as children at the family dinner table to tell the best stories, jumping from their chairs and gesticulating passionately; and two of them, the two geniuses of the family, grew up to live on their wits. But ''wits'' is not how I think of them, either before or after reading this book. ''House of horrors'' would be nearer the mark, in this version. Paul Fisher refers to the James home as a ''chamber of horrors,'' a ''plague ship'' and ''the James family bog.'' His big project is to tell the James family story as a traumatic saga of dysfunction, competition, anxiety, aspirations often thwarted, confusion, repression, breakdown and sadness, of lifelong struggles to get away and an inexorable pull back to the powerful family bond. 
The lives of all the children are shaped by the father's peculiarities: ''The young Jameses grew up borne on the shifting currents of Henry's emotions and desires, and buffeted by them.'' Resenting or hating the home, driven away from it by wanderlust, ambition and desire for independence, yet always locked into it and haunted by what Alice James called ''ghost microbes,'' the Jameses were doomed, in Fisher's words, to be ''always running away from Jameses only to collide with Jameses again.'' 
 However you choose to tell it, it's an extraordinary American family story, stretching from the 1820s to World War I. First there's the pioneering tale of the founding grandfather, William, an Ulster immigrant and self-made Albany businessman. Then, the eccentric and domineering personality of Henry James Sr., high-minded, spiritually questing, unemployed, nomadic, scarred by the amputation of his leg in childhood, his ''inward demons'' and his breakdown in his 30s (or, in the Swedenborgian terms he adopted, his ''vastation''). Then the women of the family, devotedly domestic, Presbyterian Mary James, long-suffering and managerial (described here as overcontrolling and ''passive-aggressive''), and her sister, Aunt Kate Walsh, briefly married, but for most of her life a dependent, ever-present, increasingly costive adjunct to the family. Then, the early years of the five highly competitive James children, born between 1842 and 1848, constantly moving around from Albany, New York, Europe, Newport, and Boston, undergoing a great many educational systems, subject to their father's erratic, intense demands and moral ambitions, a bewildering mixture of free choice, high expectations and close surveillance. (The parents ''routinely'' opened their children's letters, for example, well into their adulthood.) Out of this, the struggle for intellectual mastery between the older brothers, William and Henry -- the elder (''a tortured late bloomer'') taking many years of trial and tribulation to become the great psychologist and philosopher; the younger energetically forging his way as America's novelist-in-exile -- as soon as he could. In contrast to, but interlinked with, these two astounding careers, there is the bitter quest for independence, the agonized breakdowns, the strong attraction to female friendship and the hidden brilliance of the invalid sister, Alice, who died at 44. And, far away from New England or Europe, the two younger brothers, Wilkie and Bob, struggle to make a living in Florida or Chicago or Milwaukee, working as plantation owners or railroad clerks or in the iron business. Wilkie, wounded in the Civil War, always in bad health and with bad financial luck, dying young at 38; Bob, an unstable alcoholic with a failed marriage.
 The story has often been told, either as a family narrative or in individual biographies. What does Paul Fisher, a professor of English at Wellesley, bring to this crowded territory? His argument is that no single member of the family, however remarkable his or her achievement, can be understood separately from the others, and that there has as yet been no view of the family that takes into account late-20th-century work on same-sex love, gender, repression, illness, depression and alcoholism. In Fisher's view, it has never been made apparent how ''contemporary'' the Jameses are, how relevant to our times as ''the forerunners of today's Prozac-loving, depressed or bipolar, self-conscious, narcissistic, fame-seeking, self-dramatized, hard-to-mate-or-marry Americans.'' 
 This agenda sounds rousingly new, and Fisher is right to say that some of the more startling aspects of the Jameses were passed over by earlier biographers. Leon Edel notoriously played down Henry James's complicated sexuality, and for a long time relatively little attention was paid to the women of the family. But in fact, much of the work Fisher draws on for his ''new'' treatment -- on Henry James's suppressed homosexuality or on Alice James's illness and her ''Boston marriage'' -- is now very well established in James studies, and has a rather familiar look to it. Fisher nudges us, as if scandalously, toward Henry's sexual repression whenever possible -- noting, for example, his youthful description of the footmen carrying staves in London in 1855 as an indication of ''incipient sexual stirrings'' or interpreting his descriptions of male sculpture in Rome in 1869 as ''teeming with sexual, barely disguised genital metaphors.'' Fisher makes much of the homoerotic friendship between the two male characters in ''The American,'' his novel-turned-play, and sums up James's erotic history as living ''in a prison of fear.'' But there is nothing original about his theory of James's sexual repression, dutifully drawn from Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's theories of silence and closetedness. 
 Necessarily, too, Fisher's account of Alice James's turning her illness into a form of self-assertion in competition with her brothers, of her flirtatious and quasi-erotic relationship with William and of her powerfully mixed feelings about her father is heavily indebted to Jean Strouse's pioneering study, and often echoes it. Fisher quotes the same ''courtship'' poems from William to Alice as Strouse and gives similar accounts of her ''neurasthenia'' and breakdown in Switzerland.
 Still, Fisher does have some new theories, which he plays for all they are worth, the major one being Henry James Sr.'s ''chronic alcoholism.''The father's early addiction is well known, but Fisher pushes it later into the life, gives it as a significant cause for his breakdown and proposes continuing addiction as an explanation of his behavior, which he describes as ''mad'' or unstable. Bob's addiction is seen as re-enacting his father's, and Henry is also fingered as a drinker, ''even if there is no real evidence of his father's kind of alcoholism.'' Fisher makes more of the women, presenting a tougher and more oppressive mother than ''some biographers'' have done, emphasizing Aunt Kate's hitherto ''downplayed'' intrepidity and independence of thought, and makes more of William's brief attraction to the radical Jewish poet Emma Lazarus and his interest in the work of the psychic Leonora Piper. 
 Some of Fisher's discoveries have a hypothetical air, relying heavily on those useful biographical formulations ''must have'' and ''might have.'' So, if Mary and her sister, Kate, were rivals for Henry Sr.'s courtship, then Kate, if she ''felt a twinge of envy,'' must have ''hid it well.'' Similarly: ''Harry's illnesses ... must have been formative''; Bob, ''the youngest male James child, may well have been the first to try sex.'' Fisher would have liked the Jameses to be incestuous, but he has to make do with repeated innuendo about a family that ''tended toward incest ... figurative and psychological incest, at least.'' 
 Fisher's promise to put the Jameses more in their social context is energetically fulfilled. He has lots of information about Atlantic crossings, American houses and cities, shops, public lectures in Boston, mediums, jungle explorations with the naturalist Louis Agassiz, Saratoga Springs and ''wilderness tourism'' in the Adirondacks. He manages the organization of his big complicated project efficiently, driving us along without too much ''meanwhile, back in Cambridge. ...''
 My main problem with Fisher's book is its tone of voice. To make the Jameses popular, accessible and relevant, and to keep his narrative surging along, Fisher goes in for a relentlessly sprightly, up-to-the-minute headline style. This does come as a change after R. W. B. Lewis's rather stuffy prose, or Edel's leisurely psychoanalyzing of James's books. But it rapidly becomes wearing. Favorite adjectives are dysfunctional, crucial, insecure, conflicted, fateful, weird, iconic, groundbreaking and signature (as in Henry Sr.'s ''signature enthusiasm''). Henry eats bland ''comfort food'' in Britain and Alice is a ''career invalid''; Mrs. James is an ''icon of domesticity'' and Thomas Carlyle has made a ''real estate steal.'' Everything is made racy, dramatic and vivid, as in: ''Grief was evidently far from Harry's mind as he hurled himself into the gaiety of the national capital.'' Or: ''Deadly contagious illnesses roved the Victorian world with impunity.'' There are lashings of travelogue: ''The sunshine was cold but the shadows even chillier, as Harry walked into the deep narrow streets of the old city Rome.'' ''Morning coffee was a glorious business at the famous cafe of Florian's on the Piazza San Marco in Venice.'' Climaxes are loudly signposted: ''Little did he know what kind of heiress was waiting for him!'' Minor characters are briskly brought to life, with a slightly worrying emphasis on facial hair: ''the black-eyed, mustached Friedrich Nietzsche,'' ''the tubercular and long-mustached Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson,'' Henrik Ibsen ''the lion-whiskered Norwegian iconoclast.'' The book's historical aim -- a confused one -- is to persuade us that the Jameses were typical Victorians yet also exceptions to every Victorian rule: ''strange and florid paradoxes of passionate unconventionality and Victorian restraint.'' Every condescending historical cliche about Victorianism is duly trotted out. We hear repeatedly of ''the monumentally repressed 19th century,'' the treatment by Victorian men of women as ''second-class citizens,'' the eroticism of Victorian sickbeds, Victorian starchiness, double standards, conventions, self-hatred and ''ingrown ... convolutions.'' These stereotypes rush past entirely unexamined.
 Fisher's most disconcerting decision is to refer, throughout, to Henry James as ''Harry.'' This is fair enough when he is a little boy, but leads to trouble when he becomes a major novelist and legendary subject of biography. So we get ''Harry's smash-hit novella 'Daisy Miller,''' and ''Harry finished his final installment of 'The Portrait of a Lady,''' and Leon Edel's ''painstaking analysis of Harry.'' It's as if I had written a whole biography of Edith Wharton referring to her by her childhood nickname, ''Pussy,'' or as if Richard Holmes had called Shelley throughout by his family name, ''Bysshe.'' Fisher presumably wants us to feel intimate not with the famous, celebrated, public ''Master,'' but with ''the vulnerable, struggling Harry James.'' This is why, I suppose, there is rather little in the book about Henry's (or William's) writings. Fisher wants to show, not the author but the child, the son and brother, persisting as the essential self. So he pictures Henry James, after the deaths of his parents and all his siblings, as a profoundly lonely figure, playing down his adult friendships and professional relationships. He ends his book (in yet another imitation of Lytton Strachey's much-imitated ending of ''Queen Victoria'') with a deathbed rush back to James's earliest memories of childhood. It is a thoroughly infantilizing agenda, in which no one in the James family, least of all the novelist, is allowed to put childhood and family life behind him, and to be grown-up.

HEADLINE: Airlines Cutting Flights From Bradley Airport

BYLINE: By HARLAN J. LEVY

DATELINE: WINDSOR LOCKS 

 BODY:
 BRADLEY International Airport, which scored a business coup a year ago when it started daily nonstop round-trip flights to Amsterdam, will lose that cherished first route to Europe and its only nonstop flight to Los Angeles in the fall.
 Northwest Airlines and its transatlantic partner KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said that because of the high price of oil, Oct. 1 will be the last of the daily Amsterdam trips that began with such fanfare last July. 
 It was the latest blow to the regional airport. Delta Air Lines also has announced it will end its four-day-a-week nonstop flights to Los Angeles on Sept. 30. The airport is also losing its daily nonstop flight to Denver; Frontier Airlines, which is operating under bankruptcy protection, will give up the flight on Sept. 4.
 ''We're a little bit in a state of shock,'' said L. Scott Frantz, chairman of Bradley's board of directors, about the loss of the Amsterdam route, which it had coveted for decades.
 As recently as April, airport and airline officials deemed the Amsterdam service safe, despite Northwest's cost-cutting measures and its plan to merge with Delta. But a lot has changed since then, namely the continuing rise in oil prices.
 ''With 85 to 90 percent of ticket costs going for fuel, Bradley, like every other airport, is vulnerable to flight reductions, especially the long-haul flights -- anything over 1,500 miles,'' said Kiran Jain, marketing and route development director for the airport, who spent 16 months persuading Northwest to begin the flight.
 ''This was no reflection on Bradley, nor the business community, nor the leisure travelers,'' said Jeffrey Schultes, Bradley's administrator. ''The airplanes have been full, so there's nothing we could have done to stop this from happening.''
 Airport officials and Hartford and Springfield, Mass., area business groups tried. They offered Northwest $650,000 in marketing and advertising services and reduced landing fees.
 ''They responded favorably, but when oil hit $140 a barrel it didn't matter,'' Mr. Schultes said. 
 When the flights began, state officials predicted the Connecticut economy could gain $60 million a year and 1,200 new jobs. Indeed, area businesses like United Technologies use the service to Amsterdam and its connecting flights to 81 cities in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa. 
 What's disappointing, Ms. Jain said, is that the bookings are hefty and growing.
 ''Last summer the loads were in the 80 percent range -- phenomenal numbers for a start-up,'' she said, ''and this summer the numbers look even stronger.'' The last 12 months of excellent bookings bode well for future European flights, Ms. Jain said. 
 Delta, Bradley's largest carrier, has been flying the Los Angeles route for almost three years. Susan Elliott, a spokeswoman for Delta, said the flights might resume on a seasonal basis. 
 ''The flight is doing well, but it's marginally profitable, and you cannot have marginal profitable routes in this environment,'' Ms. Jain said.
 Passengers at Bradley and other airports face other burdens: The airlines are now imposing fare increases, fuel surcharges and luggage fees, and they're substituting smaller aircraft for larger ones.
 The airline industry is at risk, Ms. Jain said. ''This is not a hiccup,'' she said. ''This is unprecedented, and the financial impact is worse than 9/11, simply because there seems to be no end in sight for the spiraling fuel prices.''
 She said no further reductions are planned, but ''in this fuel environment it seems like nothing is safe anymore.''
 In a report on Bradley's future, a consultant, Gabor Kovacs, predicted that the airline industry's trouble would abate ''within 12 to 24 months.'' 
 The industry will come back, he said. 
 ''It always has and always will. Airlines have become a huge revenue source'' and generate ''a tremendous amount of savings for passengers, and a lot of supported industries have a vested interest in the airline industry's survival. It may go to the brink, but then it will pull back.''

OUTPOSTS Last week, almost 1,000 jobs were eliminated in the American newspaper industry, making it perhaps the bloodiest week yet of a year where many papers are fighting for their lives. You read about the great names -- The Baltimore Sun, The Boston Globe, The San Jose Mercury News -- as if reading the obituary page. Even rich cities like San Francisco can no longer support a profitable daily paper.
 Columnists, reporters, editors, cartoonists and photographers who brought to life the daily narrative of a city or region have been swept aside. What started as layoffs and buyouts is edging toward closures and bankruptcies.
 And here's the great paradox: all of this bad news is coming at a time when the audience and reach of many newspapers has never been greater. The Internet may kill the daily newspaper as we know it, but it's allowed some papers to increase their readership by tenfold. 
 Those who revel in the life-threatening trauma that newspapers are going through, saying they brought it upon themselves by being too liberal, too sensationalistic, too banal -- choose your insult -- miss the point. People are not deserting these complex and contradictory summaries of our collective existence. Not by any stretch. 
 Measured purely by number of readers in all formats, many newspapers have never been more successful. 
 -- Timothy Egan, ''Save the Press''
 Reader Comments:
 As long as there's a democracy, there will be newspapers. (Or maybe it's the other way around -- as long as there are newspapers, there will be a democracy.) Maybe someday we'll all have lightning-fast laptops with wireless modems and every square inch will be wired for WiFi and we can all go paperless. Take heart, all you out there who understand why we need real, authentic, objective news (and I hope there are many of us). Where there is a demand, it will be met.

 This is a beautiful testament to the craft and integrity of good journalism. In its purest form, politics is supposed to serve humanity. Journalism serves like a shadower for the people to hold politicians to that objective. Journalism is a safeguard for true democracy.

 DOMESTIC DISTURBANCES How cruel it is, the way children grow up.
 I used to hate it -- starting around the time I was 11 -- when my father would fall into fond remembrances about my toddler years. 
 ''Don't you remember ...?'' he would ask with a pained voice, a strained look about the eyes, having temporarily forgotten that you can't really remember things from before around the age of 3.
 ''Pity,'' he would say.
 What was the pity? I wanted to live in the present. 
 When I went away to college, my mother put all the stuffed animals I'd once kept on my bed in an old suitcase. She showed them to me proudly when I came home on break. ''What do you want me to do with them?'' I asked.
 ''I don't know ...'' she said. ''I thought you might want to ... look at them, or something.''
 I did not want to see them. Because they looked old, and -- it pains me even now to say it -- ugly. 
 ''Once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always, '' the Skin Horse says in ''The Velveteen Rabbit.'' 
 The Skin Horse is a sage in the world of stuffed animals. But where humans are concerned, ''Mary Poppins'' got it right: there is only a set period of time in which you can hear the starlings speak, before your brain tunes out such exquisite perceptions and fixes instead on the attentional demands of everyday life.
 -- Judith Warner, ''Getting Real''
 CAMPAIGN STOPS The gradual disintegration of the gun control movement that once drove Democratic politics is now pretty much complete. For decades, the true meaning of the Second Amendment has been the subject of wrenching public debate. But last Thursday, when the Supreme Court expressly and historically extended the right of gun ownership to private citizens, the Democratic Party's nominee for president merely shrugged.
 Certainly, there were others who spoke out forcefully against the decision, but Barack Obama, the preferred candidate of the nation's most committed gun control proponents, did not offer a syllable of protest. If his judicial nominees will be sympathetic to more stringent gun control measures than judges appointed by George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan or John McCain, there was no evidence of that sentiment last week.
 Some of the reasons for Mr. Obama's reticence have been a result of his own unique political circumstances. His campaign is aiming at Western states like Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico, where questions of gun ownership resonate differently than on traditional urban Democratic turf. And his well-chronicled statement this spring about gun owners and their bitterness is indicative of the struggle he has had in attracting working-class and rural voters. 
 But his muted response is also the culmination of a long-developing trend in the national Democratic Party: to tiptoe away from a policy discussion that they believe has caused them great political damage. 
 -- Dan Schnur, ''Guns and Democrats''
 Reader Comments:
 I have been a liberal Democrat since I came home from the war in Southeast Asia and supported McGovern for president. The individual right to keep and bear arms goes all the way back to the Magna Carta. There is no other more liberal right than to be well armed enough to overthrow your own government when it gets to big for its britches. 
 -- Posted by Tom Colton
 The general sentiment in the Democratic Party is in favor of gun control, sure. But it's so far down the list of priorities right now that it doesn't even register. The economy, Iraq, the environment, our nation's infrastructure, the deficit -- there are so many issues far more important to Democrats than guns right now.
 In the boom times of the '90s, Democrats may have had the luxury of making gun control a major issue. Not any more.
 -- Posted by Evan Grantham-Brown
 THINK AGAIN Now it turns out that the primary season -- extended, it was said, beyond expectation or reason -- was the real thing. And I say that because, at least to date, the current season -- the season that was to bring a once-in-a-century contest between two men of different generations and clearly opposed ideologies -- has been totally uninteresting.
 Part of the reason is the reduction in the cast of characters. Oh, for the days when Rudy Giuliani looked as if he might parlay three days of cheerleading into a viable candidacy, when Mitt Romney tried to look human and lost votes in proportion to the money he spent trying to buy them, when Joe Biden would explain anything to anyone whether he was asked to or not, when Mike Huckabee would cheerfully say things other candidates could not get away with, when Mike Gravel produced campaign ads no one understood. What a bunch!
 -- Stanley Fish, ''Is That All There Is?''
 Reader Comments:
 Is that all there is?
 No, that isn't all there is, but it's all America is going to get as long as its citizens are encouraged to think that election campaigns are supposed to be entertaining -- indeed, a branch of the entertainment industry that is meant to light up prime-time news channels' output. Politics in America is lamentably focused on personalities -- preferably personalities who remind us of the greats of the silver screen or, failing that, will light up the plasma screen for a few brief moments.

HEADLINE: Back in Kabul, Never at Peace

BYLINE: Photographs and text by TYLER HICKS

 BODY:
My first trip to Kabul was in 2001. I arrived as Northern Alliance soldiers were fighting Taliban gunmen in and around the Afghan capital. Those who resisted were killed, and those captured were more likely to be executed than taken prisoner. There was a power vacuum in Kabul, a brief moment when one set of rulers fled and the next had not yet taken over. This can be a liberating time for a photographer. There were no clear rules, no central authority that might restrict you from taking pictures. I've returned to Afghanistan nearly every year since then. 
 TODAY, at first glance, Kabul's dusty stalls and kebab joints, with their bearded men and covered women, look much the same -- in at least one important way -- as they did when the Taliban were forced to flee. Ordinary people seem stoic under the circumstances, which are better than they were in 2001 but still deeply uncertain. Generations of conflict have numbed the senses. From the Russian occupation during the 1980s, through the years of Taliban rule in the 1990s, and now the intensifying coalition war against the Taliban insurgency, violence has become ingrained in their lives. After a recent period being embedded with the United States Marines in southern Afghanistan, I stopped in Kabul to wander the streets and take photos of a city forever in transition. The Western presence was something not tolerated during Taliban rule, so there have been some changes.
 A new shopping mall, with escalators in a city where constant electricity is a luxury, offers Western-style clothes, gold jewelry, a cafe. A fast-food establishment, mimicking American chains, offers fried chicken and fries instead of lamb kebab and rice.
 Meanwhile, refugees and internally displaced civilians, left homeless by decades of war, have created a beggar society, with the sick and disabled desperate for food and work. The cost of housing in urban Kabul is very high compared to the countryside, and many people live in crumbling buildings and makeshift tents.
 There is also, on a hill overlooking the city, an Olympic-size pool built by the Soviets in the 1980s. It is said that the Taliban forced criminals off the platforms to their deaths at the bottom of the pool. Now, as then, it contains little or no water.
 With unemployment at about 40 percent, a large number of idle men have little to do. Snooker clubs, where men play and smoke cigarettes, are popular. So are small video arcades. Most popular are the Indian and Pakistani movies that dominate the theaters; there, for the price of a ticket, viewers can watch increasingly revealing scenes of women.
 Drug addicts crowd into a dilapidated section of the old city, smoking hashish and shooting heroin. Drug addiction is on the rise in Afghanistan, fed in part by a flow of refugees from Pakistan, who find no work but can buy the drugs cheaply. War or no war, West or no West, Afghanistan remains the world's largest producer of opium, an industry that the Taliban continue to profit from.
 The newly resurgent Taliban continue to push for greater influence, and not just in the remote regions near the Pakistan border. A recent assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai during a military parade in Kabul killed three people. Then the Taliban freed 1,200 inmates in a brazen attack on a prison in the southern city of Kandahar. 
 The Taliban, clearly, are still strong in Afghanistan. So war, as it has been for generations, is never far away.

HEADLINE: Man-Made Hunger

 BODY:
Thirty countries have already seen food riots this year. The ever higher cost of food could push tens of millions of people into abject poverty and starvation. 
 To a large degree, this crisis is man-made -- the result of misguided energy and farm policies. When President Bush and other heads of state of the Group of 8 leading industrial nations meet in Japan this week, they must accept their full share of responsibility and lay out clearly what they will do to address this crisis.
 To start, they must live up to their 2005 commitment to vastly increase aid to the poorest countries. And they must push other wealthy countries, like those in the Middle East, to help too. That will not be enough. They must also commit to reduce, or even better, do away with their most egregious agricultural and energy subsidies, which contribute to the spread of hunger throughout the world. 
 In the last year, the price of corn has risen 70 percent; wheat 55 percent; rice 160 percent. The World Bank estimates that for a group of 41 poor countries the combined shock of rising prices of food, oil and other raw materials over the past 18 months will cost them between 3 and 10 percent of their annual economic output. 
 Some of the causes are out of governments' control, including the rising cost of energy and fertilizer, and drought in food exporters like Australia. Higher consumption of animal protein in China and India has also driven demand for feed grains. Wrongheaded policies among rich and poor nations are also playing a big role. 
 Of those, perhaps the most wrongheaded are the tangle of subsidies, mandates and tariffs to encourage the production of biofuels from crops in the United States and the European Union. According to the World Bank, almost all of the growth in global corn production from 2004 to 2007 was devoted to American ethanol production -- pushing up corn and animal feed prices and prompting farmers to switch from other crops to corn.
 Long-standing farm subsidies in the rich world have also contributed to the crisis, ruining farmers in poor countries and depressing agricultural investment. 
 Rich countries are not the only culprits. At least 30 developing countries have imposed restrictions or bans on the export of foodstuffs. Importing countries are now stockpiling supplies, which takes more food from global markets. Export barriers also reduce farmers' profits and discourage them from investing in more production. 
 So far there is no sign that the leaders of the developed countries are ready to do what is needed. The United States and Europe have refused to curtail their bio-fuel subsidies or their lavish farm subsidies. They are also falling far short of their aid commitments. 
 At the 2005 G8 summit meeting, leaders said that by 2010 wealthier nations would increase annual development aid to poor countries by $50 billion. Yet aid has increased by only $11 billion. And there is suspicion that the G8 nations, who were to provide the lion's share of the increase, want to wiggle out of their commitment. 
 We welcome President Bush's pledge to provide $5 billion this year and next to ''fight global hunger,'' but much more must be done. The United States remains the stingiest of rich nations when it come to foreign aid.
 In a letter to heads of state of the G8, Robert Zoellick, the World Bank president, estimated that the bank needs $3.5 billion to provide immediate food aid and seed and fertilizer in poor countries. The International Monetary Fund and the World Food Program estimate they need $6.5 billion more in the short term to help feed vulnerable populations. This does not even count the need for essential longer-term investments to increase farm productivity in poor nations in Africa and elsewhere. 
 As Mr. Zoellick wrote, the food crisis is a test of the world's willingness to help the most vulnerable. The leaders gathered in Japan must rise to the challenge.

HEADLINE: When Ex-Employees Vent, or Reinvent

BYLINE: By MARCI ALBOHER. 
Shifting Careers, a blog by Marci Alboher, is at nytimes.com/shiftingcareers.

 BODY:
AS layoffs around the country continue to make headlines, some among the newly unemployed are venting their frustrations by posting their stories and grievances online, on blogs and other Web sites. Others are using the occasion as an impetus to start their own businesses.
 In both cases, people may attract the wrath of a former employer if it thinks they used or exposed confidential information about it, violated a noncompete agreement with it or defamed it. 
 But how easy is it for a company to succeed in a legal challenge against a former employee? I spoke with Zachary A. Hummel, an employment law partner at the firm Bryan Cave in New York, about the kinds of legal issues that terminated employees might face if their post-employment activities raised the ire of their former employers. Following is a condensed and edited version of those conversations.
 Q. This is a free country. Aren't ex-employees free to write or say whatever they like about their former employers? 
 A. People are certainly entitled to voice their opinions about their former employers, even if those opinions are not very flattering. I represent employers, and in the majority of instances when they see something online, I try to get them to calm down and look dispassionately at the facts and who will even read the postings.
 But if a disgruntled former employee goes further and accuses a former employer of violating the law or defrauding customers, for example, those statements could likely be considered defamatory if they are not true. Employers also have rights if former employees post leaks about a former employer's business strategies or other confidential information.
 Q. What if the postings are anonymous?
 A. In those cases, it does get tricky. And it is even harder if a poster contributed to someone else's site rather than maintained his or her own site. But employers can do a few things. They can contact the site's service provider and put it on notice about objectionable material.
 In many cases, providers will remove the material because they have potential liability once being put on notice. The former employer can also engage in a legal action to try to seek the identity of the person who posted the objectionable material.
 Q.One site has the following disclosure: ''In order to protect both the innocent and not-so-innocent, the only rule we ask that you follow is that you can either publish your name or the name of the company that canned you, but not both. We don't want anyone getting in any more trouble than they're already in, so let's not give those corporate lawyers any ammo, huh?'' 
 In your opinion, is the site giving good advice to potential contributors?
 A. If a poster does not use a company name, it would certainly be hard to find a reason for the company to go after that individual. But if people reveal their names, it would be a lot easier to track them down. So it seems a little odd to me. That said, it would take a pretty aggressive search on the part of an employer.
 Q.We've been focusing on ex-employees stuck in the realm of negativity, but many laid-off employees go in another direction and opt to start their own businesses. What kinds of things can former employers prevent ex-employees from doing when that happens?
 A. Laid-off workers who start their own businesses have to be careful that they don't engage in what is called unfair competition by relying on information that is not generally available to the public -- like customer contacts, pricing, etc. -- about their former employer's business. 
 For example, if because of my former employment I know the price that a particular company pays for widgets and the person who makes the buying decision at that company, and I go in and offer to sell at a lower price, there is a chance that I'm engaging in unfair competition. 
 Q. Obviously, those who signed noncompete agreements have to think even more carefully about what they can and cannot do. Any advice for those people?
 A. First, they should study their agreements. The main issues to look at are what activities are restricted, and for how long and in what geographic scope. 
 All agreements are different. Some will say that you cannot solicit business from customers you worked with at your former employer. Others will say you cannot solicit any customers at all. Others will go even further and say that you cannot even accept business if it walks in the door. But it is not just what an agreement says, it is also whether it is enforceable.
 Q.In what kinds of cases have courts decided that these agreements go too far and should not be enforced?
 A. One area is length of time. The longer a restriction is, the more likely it is that it would be deemed overly restrictive. The same is true for geographic scope. For example, if you worked for a company that sells products nationally, but you were in women's lingerie and your division only sold in New York, it might be deemed unreasonable to prohibit you from opening up a business to manufacture and sell lingerie in Los Angeles. 
 The issue courts will look at is whether the ex-employee is gaining an unfair advantage because of what was learned from working at the former employer.
 Q. Now that we live in such a boundaryless world, is all this changing a bit?
 A. There is a trend to look at these noncompete agreements more closely. But again, this varies state to state and even judge by judge. In some states, it is nearly impossible for an employer to enforce a noncompete.
 But over all, there is a growing trend limiting the scope of the prohibited activities to what is a reasonable interest for an employer to protect. On the other hand, when it comes to the use of confidential information, as long as employers can prove that former employees used the information, they will generally be upheld.
 Q. Do you see courts showing any sympathy toward people who are just trying to make a living by going out on their own?
 A. Having done this for more than 20 years, I would say that judges' attitudes are based more on legal theory than on any kind of empathy toward the large numbers of laid-off employees. This is not the first time we have seen widespread layoffs. There are cycles, and we are in one of them.

HEADLINE: Wall-E for President

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
SO much for a July Fourth week spent in idyllic celebration of our country's birthday. This year's festivities were marked instead by a debate -- childish, not constitutional -- over who is and isn't patriotic. The fireworks were sparked by a verbally maladroit retired general, fueled by two increasingly fatuous presidential campaigns, and heated to a boil by a 24/7 news culture that inflates any passing tit for tat into a war of the worlds. 
 Let oil soar above $140 a barrel. Let layoffs and foreclosures proliferate like California's fires. Let someone else worry about the stock market's steepest June drop since the Great Depression. In our political culture, only one question mattered: What was Wesley Clark saying about John McCain and how loudly would every politician and bloviator in the land react? 
 Unable to take another minute of this din, I did what any sensible person might do and fled to the movies. More specifically, to an animated movie in the middle of a weekday afternoon. What escape could be more complete? 
 Among its other attributes, this particular G-rated film, ''Wall-E,'' is a rare economic bright spot. Its enormous box-office gross last weekend swelled a total Hollywood take that was up 20 percent from a year ago. (You know America's economy is cooked when everyone flocks to the movies.) The ''Wall-E'' crowds were primed by the track record of its creator, Pixar Animation Studios, and the ecstatic reviews. But if anything, this movie may exceed its audience's expectations. It did mine. 
 As it happened, ''Wall-E'' opened the same summer weekend as the hot-button movie of the 2004 campaign year, Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11.'' Ah, the good old days. Oil was $38 a barrel, our fatalities in Iraq had not hit 900, and only 57 percent of Americans thought their country was on the wrong track. (Now more than 80 percent do.) ''Wall-E,'' a fictional film playing to a far larger audience, may touch a more universal chord in this far gloomier time. 
 Indeed, sitting among rapt children mostly under 12, I felt as if I'd stepped through a looking glass. This movie seemed more realistically in touch with what troubles America this year than either the substance or the players of the political food fight beyond the multiplex's walls. 
 While the real-life grown-ups on TV were again rebooting Vietnam, the kids at ''Wall-E'' were in deep contemplation of a world in peril -- and of the future that is theirs to make what they will of it. Compare any 10 minutes of the movie with 10 minutes of any cable-news channel, and you'll soon be asking: Exactly who are the adults in our country and who are the cartoon characters? 
 Almost any description of this beautiful film makes it sound juvenile or didactic, and it is neither. So I'll keep to the minimum. ''Wall-E'' is a robot-meets-robot love story, as simple (and often as silent) as a Keaton or Chaplin fable, set largely in a smoldering and abandoned Earth, circa 2700, where the only remaining signs of life are a cockroach and a single green sprout. 
 The robot of the title is a battered mobile trash compactor whose sole knowledge of human civilization and intimacy comes from the avalanche of detritus the former inhabitants left behind -- a Rubik's Cube, an engagement ring and, most strangely, a single stuttering VCR tape of ''Hello, Dolly!,'' a candied Hollywood musical from 1969. Wall-E keeps rewinding to the song that finds the young lovers pledging their devotion until ''time runs out.''
 Pixar is not Stanley Kubrick. Though ''Wall-E'' is laced with visual and musical allusions to ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' its vision of apocalypse now is not as dark as Kubrick's then. The new film speaks to the anxieties of 2008 as specifically as ''2001'' did to the more explosive tumult of its (election) year, 1968. That's more than upsetting enough.
 Humanity is not dead in ''Wall-E,'' but it is in peril. The world's population cruises the heavens ceaselessly on a mammoth luxury spaceship that it boarded in the early 22nd century after the planet became uninhabitable. For government, there is a global corporation called Buy N Large, which keeps the public wired to umpteenth-generation iPods and addicted to a diet of supersized liquefied fast food and instantly obsolete products. The people are too bloated to walk -- they float around on motorized Barcaloungers -- but they are happy shoppers. A billboard on the moon heralds a Buy N Large outlet mall ''coming soon,'' not far from that spot where back in the day of ''Hello, Dolly!'' idealistic Americans once placed a flag.
 And yet these rabid consumers, like us, are haunted by what paradise might have been lost. How can they reclaim what matters? How can Earth be recolonized? These questions are rarely spoken in ''Wall-E,'' but are omnipresent, like half-forgotten dreams. In this movie, a fleeting green memory of the extinct miracle of photosynthesis is as dazzling and elusive as the emerald city of Oz. 
 One of the great things about art, including popular art, is that it can hit audiences at a profound level beyond words. That includes children. The kids at ''Wall-E'' were never restless, despite the movie's often melancholy mood and few belly laughs. They seemed to instinctually understand what ''Wall-E'' was saying; they didn't pepper their chaperones with questions along the way. At the end they clapped their small hands. What they applauded was not some banal cartoonish triumph of good over evil but a gentle, if unmistakable, summons to remake the world before time runs out.
 You have to wonder what these same kids make of the political show their parents watch on TV at home. The fierce urgency of now that drives ''Wall-E'' and its yearning for change is absent in both the Barack Obama and McCain campaigns these days.
 For me, Mr. Obama showed signs of jumping the shark two weeks back, when he appeared at a podium affixed with his own pompous faux-presidential seal. It could have been a Pixar sight gag. In fact, it is a gag in ''Wall-E,'' where, in a flashback, we see that the original do-nothing chief executive of Buy N Large (prone to pronouncements like ''stay the course'') boasted his own ersatz presidential podium. 
 For all the hyperventilation on the left about Mr. Obama's rush to the center -- some warranted, some not -- what's more alarming is how small-bore and defensive his campaign has become. Whether he's reaffirming his long-held belief in faith-based programs or fudging his core convictions about government snooping, he is drifting away from the leadership he promised and into the focus-group-tested calculation patented by Mark Penn in his disastrous campaign for Hillary Clinton. Mr. Obama's Wednesday address calling for renewed public service is unassailable in principle but inadequate to the daunting size of the serious American crisis at hand. The speech could have been -- and has been -- delivered by any candidate of either party in any election year since 1960. 
 What Mr. Obama has going for him during this tailspin is that his opponent seems mortifyingly out-to-lunch. Mr. McCain is a man who aspires to lead the largest economy in the world and yet recently admitted that he doesn't know how to use a computer, the one modern tool shared by everyone from the post-industrial American work force to Middle Eastern terrorists to Pixar animators. Getting shot down over Vietnam may not be a qualification for president in 2008, but surely a rudimentary facility with a laptop is. What Mr. McCain has going for him is a press corps that often ignores or covers up such embarrassments. 
 The Republican's digital ignorance is not a function of his age but of his intellectual inflexibility and his isolation from his country's reality. To prove the point last week, he took a superfluous, if picturesque, tour of Colombia and Mexico, with occasional timeouts for him and his surrogates to respond like crybabies to General Clark's supposed slur on his patriotism.
 For connoisseurs of McCainian cluelessness, the high point was his Wednesday morning appearance on ABC's ''Good Morning America.'' The anchor, Robin Roberts, asked the only important question: Why in heaven's name was Mr. McCain in Latin America when ''the U.S. economy is really at the forefront of voters' minds''?
 ''I know Americans are hurting very badly right now,'' he explained, channeling the first George Bush's ''Message: I care.'' As he spoke, those hurting Americans could feast on the gorgeous flora and fauna of the Cartagena, Colombia, tourist vista serving as his backdrop. ''It's really lovely here,'' Mr. McCain said. Since he can't drop us an e-mail, a video postcard will have to do. 
 Mr. McCain should be required to see ''Wall-E'' to learn just how far adrift he is from an America whose economic fears cannot be remedied by his flip-flop embrace of the Bush tax cuts (for the wealthy) and his sham gas-tax holiday (for everyone else). Mr. Obama should see it to be reminded of just how bold his vision of change had been before he settled into a front-runner's complacency. Americans should see it to appreciate just how much things are out of joint on an Independence Day when a cartoon robot evokes America's patriotic ideals with more conviction than either of the men who would be president.

HEADLINE: Catch-22 of Urban Renewal

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
FOR more than 30 years, Theodora Skipitares, a theater director and performance artist, and a hardy band of her neighbors, who are painters, photographers and a writer of experimental novels, struggled to make a home in a loft building on East Third Street, on one of the most troubled stretches of the Bowery. 
 They lived one creative artist per floor in a drab nine-story building at 5 East Third Street, opposite the once-notorious Third Street Men's Shelter. The artists lived a precarious existence, paying rent to New York City every month after the city condemned the 25-foot-wide building in 1971 in the name of urban renewal. In the end, however, their building was bypassed. 
 Last month, after about a decade of negotiations with the city, the artists took title to their apartments in a newly formed condominium, according to city records. They paid a total of $630,000 in cash for the eight apartments and a ground-floor rental space and promised to reimburse the city about $470,000 a unit if they sell their apartments. The penalty for selling will decrease over the next 30 years. 
 The name Wyoming Building is carved into the facade, and the new owners named their condominium the Wyoming Arts Condominium.
 The buyers include Ms. Skipitares, who performs with a life-size puppet; Natan Nuchi, an Israeli-born painter whose work is laced with Holocaust references; Walter Abish, an experimental novelist and short-story writer and winner of a MacArthur Fellowship; Geoffrey Biddle, a photographer; and Howard Guttenplan, the director of the Millennium Film Workshop.
 Since the artists began negotiations with the city, the neighborhood has been transformed. The men's shelter has long since been redesigned and turned over to a nonprofit group, and last year the trendy 17-story Bowery Hotel opened next to the shelter. 
 Two blocks away, Ian Schrager's 40 Bond Street has given the neighborhood a new cachet. (Buyers are already asking $3,000 per square foot, on average, to resell their luxury apartments.) 
 At current loft prices, the artist-owners appear to have instantly accumulated equity of more than $1 million each. So why aren't they happy? 
 It turns out that as part of their deal with the city, they agreed to borrow money to fix up the building and to obtain a new certificate of occupancy. They put the one vacant apartment, a bare shell of a loft, on the market through Brahna Yassky, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, for $1.7 million, and hoped to use the proceeds to pay off the loan.
 Ms. Yassky quickly found a buyer. But there was a Catch-22 situation: they couldn't pay off the loan until the vacant loft was sold, and the buyer couldn't close the deal until they obtained a certificate of occupancy.
 Like many other building owners, they found their efforts to obtain the certificate had stalled, lost in delay and the intricate details of plumbing and electrical inspections. (Building department records show that one cause was a single kitchen sink that failed an inspection because the drain was 1 1/2 inches, instead of the required 2 inches.) 
 Meanwhile, while they wait, interest payments have begun to add up. Ms. Skipitares and Mr. Nuchi, two leaders of the conversion plan, would not discuss the conversion, because of the pending application for the certificate of occupancy.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Brokers as Naysayers

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
NEW YORK'S borrowers could notice a different tone in their discussions with mortgage brokers in coming months, as brokers adjust to a new state law that seeks to stem foreclosures. 
 The legislation, which was passed by the New York Legislature in June and is expected to be signed by Gov. David A. Paterson, aims to curb the current surge in foreclosures, but it also includes provisions meant to prevent borrowers from taking out loans they cannot repay.
 Among other things, it says that brokers have a ''duty of care'' to offer appropriate loans to subprime borrowers -- those with poor credit. 
 Brokers are asking, however, what constitutes an appropriate loan, and what happens if a borrower disagrees with a broker's recommendation.
 ''We have some serious issues with this law,'' said Gene Tricozzi, the president of the New York Association of Mortgage Brokers. ''There are some things here that'll hang us out to dry.''
 Specifically, Mr. Tricozzi said, the legislation requires brokers to weigh a borrower's future earnings in selecting appropriate loans. For some borrowers, like pregnant women or workers nearing retirement, such prognostications might be unreliable. Yet refusal to offer loans to such borrowers could be construed as age or gender discrimination, he said.
 The legislation comes as lawmakers and consumer advocacy groups have sharpened their scrutiny of mortgage brokers, because many seem to have offered loans to borrowers who had little chance of repaying them.
 Often lost amid this scrutiny, brokers argue, is the fact that lenders themselves checked the borrower's finances and willingly approved these loans.
 Still, some advocates want to hold mortgage brokers to the same legal standard as stockbrokers and other financial advisers, who carry a fiduciary duty to act in their clients' best interests and offer only ''suitable'' financial products. New York's proposed law specifically stops short of the suitability standard, said Richard H. Neiman, New York's banking superintendent.
 But brokers may still face situations where they must argue against matching a borrower with a certain loan, even though the borrower could qualify for that mortgage and the loan would allow the borrower to afford -- in the short term, at least -- his or her dream home.
 Not all borrowers suffer for taking on high risk, of course. During the recent real estate bubble, some borrowers who chose loans with skyrocketing interest rates emerged unscathed because they were able to refinance into less risky loans or quickly sold the homes for a premium.
 When the real estate market rebounds and lenders make loans more liberally, brokers fear they may be held liable if a borrower overrides a recommendation and opts for a riskier loan and the loan fails. But if brokers deny loans, they fear they could lose business and possibly do a disservice to their customers.
 Rholda Ricketts, the deputy superintendent of mortgage banking for the New York Banking Department, which had a role in drafting the bill, said a broker who disagreed with a borrower's loan choice might be wise to have him or her sign a document that essentially releases the broker from legal responsibility. 
 Before such details can be worked out, though, borrowers with subprime credit could find fewer loan options, as brokers avoid potential liability.
 ''In some cases, I might say I don't have a lender that supplies a certain subprime program,'' said Mr. Tricozzi of the state mortgage brokers group, ''even though, in reality, I do.''

HEADLINE: A Ban on Cockfighting, But Tradition Lives On

BYLINE: By ADAM B. ELLICK

DATELINE: CHAPARRAL, N.M. 

 BODY:
After two weeks of preparation, 150 officers, backed up by a helicopter, slipped into this sleepy desert town. Their focus was not illegal immigration or drug smuggling, but a less pressing crime: cockfighting. 
 But when they raided what was billed as the Christmas Cockfighting Derby in December expecting to find 300 cockfighters, they found fewer than a dozen people. The cockfighters had been tipped off, the police said, and the officers issued tickets for four misdemeanors before seizing 12 shrieking roosters.
 Last year, New Mexico became the 49th state to make cockfighting illegal. (Louisiana will become the last state when a ban there takes effect in August.) The state has devoted vast resources to ending the sport, but with only one misdemeanor conviction thus far, it continues unabated in hidden venues, cockfighters and law enforcement officials say. 
 And light penalties -- a first offense is a petty misdemeanor -- have not only failed to stop the fights, they continue to attract cockfighters from four of New Mexico's five neighboring states, where the sport is a felony. 
 ''It seems they're always one step ahead of us,'' said Robyn Gojkovich, who in May became the state's first full-time animal control investigator.
 Ed Lowry, 51, a paunchy rooster breeder from Chaparral, agreed.
 ''They ain't shut nothing down,'' said Mr. Lowry, who has not been charged, even though his truck and computers were seized in the December raid.
 Mr. Lowry, who still possesses his prized bloodlines, said he constantly turns down invitations to fight. As a director of the New Mexico Gamefowl Association, a nonprofit cockfighting advocacy group, he has taken up fighting in the courts, where appeals claiming tribal, religious and cultural sovereignty have failed to win exemptions from the ban.
 ''A gamecock shows me what an American should be like,'' he said. ''You defend to the death.''
 To avoid the police, law enforcement officers say, promoters have relocated the fights from large arenas to clandestine sites on sprawling properties. Lookouts are stationed atop dusty mesas, and speakers, which in the past blared mariachi music, now carry feeds from police scanners.
 But law enforcement officials are not giving up. They insist their aggressive operations -- the raids, the full-time investigator, a special cockfighting task force -- are sending a message in a war of attrition.
 Nationally, though, it appears that animal rights advocates are winning that war, and they have been helped by a high-profile case. The conviction of the football star Michael Vick in a dogfighting operation in 2007 has pushed animal cruelty cases to the fore. 
 Circulation of the country's largest trade magazine for cockfighting, The Gamecock, has fallen to 8,000 from about 14,000 over the last decade as states strengthened penalties for animal cruelty. And the wider cockfighting community, once an $80 million industry in the state, is suffering. In New Mexico, profits at feed stores and hotels in cockfighting strongholds are down as much as 70 percent, owners said. 
 Some police officers in this state say the pressure for stepped-up enforcement from the animal rights lobby has become so intense that resources are being diverted from more serious crimes, like drunken driving and amphetamine abuse.
 For years the state's governor, Bill Richardson, a Democrat, avoided the issue. In 2006, Jay Leno ridiculed him on the ''Tonight Show,'' for saying there were strong arguments on both sides of the issue. At that time, the sport was already a felony in 33 states. But in March 2007, Mr. Richardson signed the measure outlawing the sport. He was widely criticized as only getting behind the legislation because he was then running for president. 
 ''You can't go on the national stage and have people find out you have no problem with a bloody sport,'' said Sheriff Darren White of Bernalillo County, where officers issued citations for two cockfighting misdemeanors in a raid on June 21. 
 Mr. Richardson's office said he would not be available to discuss the issue.
 Sheriff White, a Republican who is running for Congress, said the ban has transformed public opinion on animal cruelty issues. Animal rights advocates agree.
 ''New Mexico is on the verge of having a modern culture,'' said Heather Ferguson, the legislative director for Animal Protection of New Mexico, an animal-rights lobbying group. Ms. Ferguson said a newly established animal cruelty hot line was receiving about 90 calls every two weeks.
 As public support rises, so do costs. The Chaparral raid cost the four counties involved more than $25,000, officials said. And several high-ranking police officers, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to talk to reporters, said that while they oppose cockfighting they are frustrated at how politicians are disproportionately emphasizing the crime.
 ''We don't even investigate misdemeanors on other crimes,'' one officer said. ''We laugh at these investigations.'' Of one cockfighting raid he said: ''We wasted $10,000 on a recent misdemeanor. I'd rather use that for a D.U.I. checkpoint and take 20 people off the road in the three hours and save lives over chickens. I feel good when we save chickens, but whoop-de-do, a misdemeanor?'' 
 Others defended the raids, citing ties between cockfighting and other criminal enterprises, like illegal gambling.
 ''You aren't going to take down a cockfighting ring with two or three people,'' Sheriff White said. ''This is not a friendly card game. There's a lot more going on.''
 Ms. Ferguson said she would like to see even more legal action on the issue. She is seeking $200,000 in additional state money to finance positions like a full-time prosecutor for animal cruelty cases. In addition, she is working to make cockfighting a felony in New Mexico. Over the next year, Animal Protection of New Mexico will lobby for about $1.1 million for three new animal custody facilities that would be completed by 2010. 
 For 16 years, Richard and Louisa Lopez operated a 310-seat cockfighting arena at their farm in Luis Lopez, N.M. The $30,000 they earned annually from the operation helped subsidize their farm expenses, and send their children to college. Last month, they used the arena for their family reunion and a baby shower. 
 ''We don't have money to buy diesel sometimes,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''And this is the place that kept my farm going.''
 In January, the courts dismissed a suit by the New Mexico Gamefowl Association claiming economic devastation. Ms. Gojkovich, the animal control investigator, was hardly sympathetic.
 ''You need to go find a job at Wal-Mart,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Trying to Stem Exodus Of the Island's Young

BYLINE: By CAROLYN NARDIELLO

DATELINE: Edgewood 

 BODY:
 WHEN Natalie Gaebelein's parents left Stony Brook for upstate New York last year, reality hit home for her. Ms. Gaebelein, then 24, had been living with her parents and needed to find another place, but like many 20- and 30-somethings in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, she felt her housing options were slim. 
 ''There's no hope,'' said Ms. Gaebelein, who had returned to the Island after graduating from Brevard College in North Carolina. ''Either you're locked in your parents' house or in an illegal sublet somewhere.'' 
 Ms. Gaebelein, a public relations representative, wanted to remain on Long Island for its beaches and close proximity to New York City and because it was home. She moved into a $1,000-a-month basement apartment in Hamptons Bays. Then she decided to act to help other young adults who find it difficult to remain here. 
 Last summer, Ms. Gaebelein started an organization called Stay on Long Island. Working with developers, business organizations and public officials, her group, which now has about 1,000 members in their 20s and early 30s, has been trying to find ways to keep young people on the Island. 
 ''It's time Long Island lets us grow up,'' she said during a recent interview at the Heartland office complex, which is owned by the developer Gerald Wolkoff.
 When Ms. Gaebelein approached Mr. Wolkoff, 71, looking for tips on places to live, he said he would finance her organization, which was then in its initial stages, and let her use his office space for meetings. He also gave the group $5,000 to build a Web site. 
 Mr. Wolkoff said young people would stay on Long Island if they had more affordable living options and places to socialize. He said he hoped to boost support for his $4 billion plan to build a self-contained community in Brentwood with 9,000 apartments, three million square feet of office space, a civic center, a hotel and an aquarium plus restaurants and retail. The plan includes a minimum of 20 percent affordable housing units, according to the Islip town supervisor, Phil Nolan.
 ''These are our brains of Long Island,'' Mr. Wolkoff said, pointing to Ms. Gaebelein and two of Stay on Long Island's board members. ''Our brains are leaving.''
 From 1990 to 2006, the number of 25- to 34-year-olds on Long Island declined by 35 percent, according to the Long Island Index, an annual study of economic and social trends. In 2000, 62 percent of houses sold in Nassau and Suffolk Counties cost less than $250,000, the report said; by 2006, the number had dropped to 4 percent. 
 Citing high taxes and a lack of affordable housing and well-paying jobs, Stay on Long Island members said it had become more difficult to stay in the place where they grew up.
 ''We're in pause, and we can't hit play to move forward,'' said Jennifer Morales, the group's vice president of public relations.
 Ms. Morales, 26, is a Long Island University graduate who lives with her parents in Islip. She said it was a struggle to make ends meet despite working two jobs, with an electronics company and at a gym. 
 Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, a business group, said the first step to keeping young people in the area is to provide affordable housing. ''It's not only feasible, but there's a market for it,'' he said. 
 Only about 19 percent of Long Island's housing is rental, according to figures from the census and the Long Island Index. Mr. Crosson's organization estimates a need for 100,000 additional rental housing units on Long Island over the next decade.
 ''Stay on Long Island is not a magic wand that is going to bring affordable housing to young people,'' said County Legislator Ricardo Montano, who provided technical and other support to the group. ''But I think long term, they're going to make progress.''

HEADLINE: The Quandary of a Superpower As Others Race to Catch Up

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KOTKIN

 BODY:
THIS Fourth of July weekend could not be more propitious for taking stock of America and its place in the world. The experiment that declared independence in 1776, and fought and bought its way across a continent, became by the 20th century the world's richest and most powerful nation ever. But what about the 21st century?
 Two politically divergent experts concur in recent books that the United States will remain the globe's top dog despite a plethora of challenges and a governing class not fully up to them, and despite the spectacular rise of other large countries. 
 Fire up the holiday barbecues.
 This ''sky is not falling'' argument is made both by Robert Kagan, an adviser to Senator John McCain, in ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams'' (Knopf, $19.95), and by Fareed Zakaria, in ''The Post-American World'' (Norton, $25.95), which Senator Barack Obama has been photographed carrying, with a bookmark. But each author also notes that the rise of other countries entails a major relative diminution in American sway. And they differ on the appropriate American response. 
 The optimism of Mr. Zakaria, editor of Newsweek International and an immigrant from India, contrasts with the pessimism of Mr. Kagan, a pundit and a scion of a Yale classicist.
 Mr. Kagan's best seller makes four points, three of them spot on, one off the wall. First, he says that, unfortunately, ''growing national wealth and autocracy have proven compatible.'' Russia and China have boomed economically while suppressing political voices.
 Second, Mr. Kagan -- who cites an essay by the Bulgarian scholar Ivan Krastev -- understands that autocracy is a belief system. To many Russians and Chinese, democracy has been a cause of chaos in their large and fractious countries as well as a cover for raw Western interests. By contrast, centralized authoritarian rule has enabled them to be ''sovereign'' -- that is, to block outsider meddling in their affairs and to project their own power abroad.
 Hence Mr. Kagan's call to ''end the dreams'' about a liberal order everlasting. ''Thanks to decades of remarkable growth,'' he writes, ''the Chinese today can argue that their model of economic development, which combines an increasingly open economy with a closed political system, can be a successful option for development in many nations.'' Just ask Russia.
 Third, he points out that radical Islamism also rejects democracy, but has no answer for modernity. Islamism has not produced the Chinese or Russian growth rates.
 Such newfound realism regarding the success and the popularity of authoritarianism, as well as the limits of Islamism, turns to mush when Mr. Kagan moves to his fourth point -- namely, what to do about his first three points. He wants to resurrect the idea of a League of Democracies.
 It's an inspiring vision: democracies joined together to protect the world against bullies. But democracies no less than autocracies have interests. South Africa has shied away from pressuring President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Germany refuses to go along with bouncing Russia from the Group of 8. India has been friendly toward the Burmese junta. In fact, no democracy outside the United States is calling for a League of Democracies. Such a concert, incongruously, could not be democratic in operation unless the United States suddenly relinquished a substantial degree of its sovereignty. America would also have to abandon its vital close relations with many autocracies, or risk canceling out the entire endeavor amid accusations of hypocrisy.
 So much for the end of dreams.
 Countries do not act and align in the international arena primarily based on their political systems, as countless examples show. The challenge for American foreign policy is not a world supposedly dividing between two camps, one democratic and one authoritarian, as Mr. Kagan asserts. Rather, it is the excessive dependence of a welcoming liberal order that benefits many countries, autocracies included, on America. Other countries squawk, then too often have a free ride. An overstretched United States must, yet refuses to, share the running of global affairs.
 Enter Mr. Zakaria, whose best seller argues that the advance of China, India and others is an opportunity for the United States. American business, he observes, has unsentimentally reaped rich rewards by adapting to the rise of the rest of the world. But America's political establishment, he laments, tends to see ''accommodations as appeasement.'' Mr. Zakaria suggests that in a world of ''one superpower, many great powers,'' as the Chinese say, the United States must avoid the trap of impossible grand crusades, compromise and conduct a la carte multilateralism. Hard, and hardly inspirational. 
 The idealist proposes a realist foreign policy. 
 STILL, what makes the mistitled ''Post-American World'' so captivating, for all its glibness in places, is Mr. Zakaria's relentless demonstration that ''the world is going America's way.'' Even as others become wealthier, the United States remains well ahead in higher education -- ''America's best industry,'' he says -- and high technology, the most valuable areas in which to dominate. Immigration causes America fits, but it is another decisive advantage.
 Mr. Kagan seems to fear competition. Marveling that autocracies have somehow become more proficient, he could have noted that today's autocracies are empowered and shaped by something their predecessors did not enjoy -- the American market and provisioning of global order. Real rather than rhetorical confrontation with the United States is unwinnable, and unnecessary. China can have its cake and eat it too, widening its influence while overturning nothing, something that Russia may yet figure out as well. 
 Mr. Zakaria mostly fears fear. ''We have managed to spook ourselves in a time of worldwide peace and prosperity,'' he writes, noting the dread of ''terrorists and rogue nations, Muslims and Mexicans, foreign companies and free trade, immigrants and international organizations.'' 
 Detailing his way through world history, he strains to explain the rise of the West, then flirts with condescension (''the natives have gotten good at capitalism''). But the rest of the world has been globalizing itself for a long time, and Mr. Zakaria's book is actually a brilliant brief about how the world may even globalize Washington.

HEADLINE: Employers Fight Tough Measures On Immigration

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Under pressure from the toughest crackdown on illegal immigration in two decades, employers across the country are fighting back in state legislatures, the federal courts and city halls.
 Business groups have resisted measures that would revoke the licenses of employers of illegal immigrants. They are proposing alternatives that would revise federal rules for verifying the identity documents of new hires and would expand programs to bring legal immigrant laborers.
 Though the pushback is coming from both Democrats and Republicans, in many places it is reopening the rift over immigration that troubled the Republican Party last year. Businesses, generally Republican stalwarts, are standing up to others within the party who accuse them of undercutting border enforcement and jeopardizing American jobs by hiring illegal immigrants as cheap labor.
 Employers in Arizona were stung by a law passed last year by the Republican-controlled Legislature that revokes the licenses of businesses caught twice with illegal immigrants. They won approval in this year's session of a narrowing of that law making clear that it did not apply to workers hired before this year. 
 Last week, an Arizona employers' group submitted more than 284,000 signatures -- far more than needed -- for a November ballot initiative that would make the 2007 law even friendlier to employers.
 Also in recent months, immigration bills were defeated in Indiana and Kentucky -- states where control of the legislatures is split between Democrats and Republicans -- due in part to warnings from business groups that the measures could hurt the economy.
 In Oklahoma, chambers of commerce went to federal court and last month won an order suspending sections of a 2007 state law that would require employers to use a federal database to check the immigration status of new hires. In California, businesses have turned to elected officials, including the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, to lobby federal immigration authorities against raiding long-established companies. 
 While much of the employer activity has been at the grass-roots level, a national federation has been created to bring together the local and state business groups that have sprung up over the last year.
 ''These employers are now starting to realize that nobody is in a better position than they are to make the case that they do need the workers and they do want to be on the right side of the law,'' said Tamar Jacoby, president of the new federation, ImmigrationWorks USA. 
 After years of laissez-faire enforcement, federal immigration agents have been conducting raids at a brisk pace, with 4,940 arrests in workplaces last year. Although immigration has long been a federal issue, more than 175 bills were introduced in states this year concerning the employment of immigrants, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 State lawmakers said they had acted against businesses, often in response to fervent demands from voters, to curb job incentives that were attracting shadow populations of illegal immigrants. 
 ''Illegal immigration is a threat to the safety of Missouri families and the security of their jobs,'' Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican, said after the Missouri Legislature passed a crackdown law in May. ''I am pleased that lawmakers heeded my call to continue the fight where Washington has failed to act.'' 
 But because of the mobilization of businesses, the state proposals this year have increasingly reflected their concerns. State lawmakers ''are starting to be more responsive to the employer community because of its engagement in the issue,'' said Ann Morse, who monitors immigration for the national legislature conference.
 The offensive by businesses has been spurred by the federal enforcement crackdown, by inaction in Congress on immigration legislation and by a rush of punitive state measures last year that created a checkerboard of conflicting requirements. Many employers found themselves on the political defensive as they grappled, even in an economic downturn, with shortages of low-wage labor. 
 Mike Gilsdorf, the owner of a 37-year-old landscaping nursery in Littleton, Colo., saw the need for action by businesses last winter when he advertised with the Labor Department, as he does every year, for 40 seasonal workers at market-rate wages to plant, prune and carry his shrubs in the summer heat. Only one local worker responded to the notice, he said, and then did not show up for the job. 
 Mr. Gilsdorf was able to fill his labor force with legal immigrants from Mexico through a federal guest worker program. But that program has a tight annual cap, and Mr. Gilsdorf realized that he might not be so lucky next year. His business could fail, he said, and then even his American workers would lose their jobs. 
 ''We're not hiring illegals, we're not paying under the table,'' Mr. Gilsdorf said. ''But if we don't get in under the cap and nobody is answering our ads, we don't have employees.'' His group, Colorado Employers for Immigration Reform, is pressing Congress for a much larger and more flexible guest worker program. 
 Unhappy California businesses won the support of Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, who wrote a letter in March to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff criticizing immigration agents for aiming raids at ''established, responsible employers'' in the city and urging him to focus on those with a record of labor violations. 
 In Virginia, an employers' coalition headed off bills that would have closed businesses that hire illegal immigrants and would have required all employers to participate in the federal system to check the working papers of new hires, which is known as E-Verify. Business groups nationwide oppose mandatory use of the system, which is now voluntary, because they say the Social Security Administration database it draws upon is full of errors that could lead to job denials for American citizens and legal immigrants and bureaucratic overload for the agency.
 Virginia employers said they learned a lesson last year after the broad immigration bill they supported failed in Congress. 
 ''The silent masses of businesses out there should have been on the phone with their Congressional representatives calling for rational reform,'' said Hobey Bauhan, president of the Virginia Poultry Federation, whose members include some of the biggest low-wage employers in the state. Virginia lawmakers ultimately adopted verification rules aimed at employers who systematically hire illegal immigrants.
 In this legislative session, Arizona businesses rallied behind a bill to create what would have been the first state guest worker program in the country. Their advertising campaign used the slogan ''What part of legal don't you understand?'' -- a tweak of the battle cry of their opponents, who use the same phrase with the word ''illegal.''
 Arizona employers said they knew that passage would be difficult for the bill, because only the federal government can issue visas to immigrant workers. 
 Although the bill never came to a vote, employers said the debate helped make their views known in Washington. 
 ''It's a message to the federal government,'' said Joe Sigg, director of government relations for the Arizona Farm Bureau, ''that we need a legal and reliable means to recruit workers.'' 
 Employers' groups have not succeeded everywhere. Under a bill passed this year, Mississippi is the first state to make it a felony for an illegal immigrant to work. The measure also allows terminated employees to sue their employer if they were replaced by an illegal immigrant.
 President Bush on June 9 ordered all federal contractors to check new workers with E-Verify. The administration is pressing forward with a rule that would pressure employers to fire within 90 days any worker whose identity information does not match the records of the Social Security Administration, as frequently happens with illegal immigrants. The first version of the rule was held up last year by a federal court injunction.
 While many businesses have come forward, they say they speak for many others with immigrant workers that are lying low after finding that the crackdown has left them in a perilous legal bind. While raids and sanctions are increasing, employers with low-wage immigrant workers are barred by antidiscrimination rules from examining identity documents of new hires too closely or checking the immigration status of employees after they have been hired. 
 ''The problem for business is that despite their complete compliance with the law, it is inevitable for employers with large numbers of immigrant workers that a certain percentage will be unauthorized workers using false documents,'' said Peter Schey, a lawyer who represents two California companies facing scrutiny by federal immigration agents. ''The system is just as broken for employers as it is for immigrants.''
 One employer facing this problem is the chief executive of a $20 million company on the outskirts of Los Angeles that assembles electronic parts. She said she had come to fear that her company -- including its legal workers -- is at risk of being crippled by an immigration raid. 
 The executive spoke on the condition that neither she nor her company be identified by name, for fear of attracting immigration authorities. 
 A human resources manager who worked for the company a decade ago hired a number of workers without conducting an extra check of their documents with the Social Security Administration, the executive said. Now she has received notices from the agency of mismatches in the identity documents of 20 workers who were hired 10 years ago, out of 90 workers on the assembly floor today. 
 Because of the antidiscrimination rules, the executive cannot check to be certain that the 20 workers, mainly Hispanic women, are illegal. Moreover, they have advanced through training, she said, and excel at their jobs, which require the repetitive assembly of tiny parts by hand, often under microscopes. 
 ''I can't replace those people,'' the executive said. She said that despite offering competitive wages from $9 to $17 an hour, the company had failed over the years in repeated efforts to attract nonimmigrant workers because of the state's tight technology labor market and because of the nature of the work, exacting and tedious. If the workers were fired or arrested, she said, she could fail to meet her contracts.
 ''If we have to terminate 20 people, that's going to jeopardize 100 other jobs of people who are legal, Americans, people who are making a good living,'' she said.
 Angelo Paparelli, an immigration lawyer who represents the company, said: ''This is not an employer who wants to turn a blind eye to lawbreaking. She is facing a tightening of the enforcement vise that does not take into account Congress's failure to create a workable system.'' 
 California employers were shocked by the raid earlier this year at Micro Solutions Enterprises, an established manufacturer of printer cartridges that is based in Los Angeles and has more than 800 workers. Officials said 138 workers were arrested. In a message to his customers, Avi Wazana, the Micro Solutions owner, said the company had been verifying the legal status of all new hires through federal programs for nearly a year.
 Bush administration officials said the crackdown was the price employers must pay to persuade voters to agree to open the gates to immigrant workers. In an interview, Mr. Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, said, ''We are not going to be able to satisfy the American people on a legal temporary worker program until they are convinced that we will have a stick as well as a carrot.''

HEADLINE: Affirmative Distraction

DATELINE: Aspen, Colo. 

 BODY:
 THIRTY years ago last week, the Supreme Court handed down its Bakke decision, hoping to end the argument over the constitutionality of affirmative action in college admission. But with hindsight, it's clear that the justices mainly helped hasten the end of serious discussion about racial justice in America. As they set the stage for a lasting argument over who should get into college, the wound of race continued to fester, unhealed, and our politics moved on.
 The ruling in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke was the court's disorderly attempt in 1978 to bring some order to racially conscious admissions programs. The medical school of the University of California at Davis had set aside 16 spots for members of groups described as having been subjected to past discrimination. 
 The program was not unusual. Worried about lagging minority enrollments and prodded by the federal government, colleges across the country, having once taken race into account to keep certain groups out, had begun considering it as a factor in order to help members of those groups get in. A rejected applicant, Allan P. Bakke, argued that the program at Davis discriminated against him because he was white. 
 The Supreme Court was unable to make up its collective mind. Four of the justices would have upheld nearly all college affirmative action programs, and four others would have struck nearly all of them down. Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.'s lone opinion therefore controlled the result.
 Justice Powell proposed that university administrators could consider an applicant's race -- sometimes, anyway -- as long as they did not establish any racial quota, a term he inexactly defined. Baffled colleges consulted baffled lawyers. Justice Powell's laudable effort at compromise had sown confusion. Eventually, college administrators worked out their response: They would pay attention to the Bakke decision when it suited them -- the rest of the time they would ignore it.
 In the ensuing years, America has come to treat racial injustice the same way. Having failed miserably in our efforts to undo the damage wrought by two centuries of slavery and another of Jim Crow, we threw up our hands and moved on. We still fight over affirmative action and pretend it means we're fighting over racial justice. We debate its pros and cons in order to avoid coming to grips with more fundamental challenges.
 Those who suffer most from the legacy of racial oppression are not competing for spaces in the entering classes of the nation's most selective colleges. Millions of them are not finishing high school. We countenance vast disparities in education in America, in where children start and where they come out. And we do not even want to talk about it. 
 It was not always this way. From the early years of the nation's founding through somewhere in the mid-1970s, racial injustice was the fundamental moral question of American politics. Through wars and depressions, through scandals and disasters, the attention of the American people was repeatedly yanked back -- at times forcefully -- to the divide between black and white.
 America fought over slavery. America fretted about Jim Crow and finally put a stop to it. During the 1960s, the nation tried out various remedies for its horrific history, including school integration and, especially during the Nixon administration, minority hiring programs. But by 1978, the nation's attention was slipping to other pressing moral questions -- abortion and the environment, for instance -- and has never quite slipped back.
 It's true that, nowadays, some of the data on racial progress are rosy, and deserving of celebration. In the past decade alone, according to the Census Bureau, the number of black adults with advanced degrees has nearly doubled. More than half a million more black students are in college today than in the early 1990s. Since 1989, the median income of black families has increased more than 16 percent in constant dollars. In the years since the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act, the black-white gap in test scores has narrowed, and is now smaller than it has ever been. The black middle class has never been larger.
 For the first time, a major party is going to nominate an African-American candidate for president.
 But it's also true that income stratification among African-Americans has increased, and the gap between the well-off and the poor is growing. One in three black students fails to finish high school, and nearly all of those who don't graduate are poor. Rates of violent crime are falling nationally, but the murder rate among young black men has risen sharply. America has two black communities, really, and one of them is falling further and further behind.
 Alas, the structure of our politics makes it increasingly difficult to address the plight of those for whom race and poverty have become inexorably intertwined. For example, even though we know that children of married parents are significantly less likely to have trouble in school or to wind up poor or in prison, politicians on the left continue to oppose programs to encourage marriage. 
 Critics like to claim that other forces -- poverty, for example, or discrimination -- discourage marriage. No doubt they do. But marriage rates among African-Americans were significantly higher when segregation was everywhere and poverty rampant. The poverty rate among African-Americans has declined by a quarter since Bakke was decided, but the marriage rate has plummeted, and life for the children of the inner city is often nasty, brutish and short.
 What about education? According to data from the Harvard Civil Rights Project, schools are significantly more segregated in the Northeast than in the South. The reason might be not overt racism, but the fact that affluent blue-state families are likely to move to the suburbs or send their children to private school. One obvious response would be to give poor families in the inner cities the money they need to purchase private education for their children. But this the Democratic Party steadfastly opposes.
 For its part, the Republican Party, last seen fighting tooth and claw against efforts to extend the Voting Rights Act, continues to oppose what activists like to call throwing money at the problem of poverty. For both parties, affirmative action represents a way to pretend to be doing something -- what I have long called racial justice on the cheap.
 Cheap is what we like. When political consultants say, ''Programs for the poor are poor programs,'' what they mean is that poverty plays poorly on the stump. Even John Edwards, in trying to focus the nation's attention on poverty during his presidential campaign, proposed strategies like raising the minimum wage, which, while admirable, do nothing to help the poor and may, at the margins, even harm them.
 University affirmative action programs, whatever their benefits, are no remedy for the problems of the black poor. Perhaps this is why Barack Obama has questioned publicly whether his children should benefit from them and also why leading voices on the black left -- Cornel West comes to mind -- have proposed that college admissions programs give preferential consideration based on economic class. 
 But restructuring affirmative action programs, although perhaps a good idea, would in the end, like the Bakke decision, amount to more tinkering around the edges. Unless racial justice once again becomes the centerpiece of American politics, with both parties willing to rethink their positions, those who are suffering most from our legacy of racial oppression will continue to fall further behind.

HEADLINE: Shedding the 'Safe' Label

BYLINE: By MORGAN McGINLEY

DATELINE: Storrs 

 BODY:
 MICHAEL J. HOGAN arrived at the University of Connecticut last September as its 14th president knowing he was inheriting a school vastly improved from a decade ago. Once a ''safety school'' with deteriorating facilities, the university now boasts rising test scores among entering freshmen and spruced-up academic facilities, thanks to a nearly $2 billion taxpayer-funded construction investment.
 Dr. Hogan's predecessor, Philip E. Austin, oversaw the largest expansion in the school's history when the governor and state legislators committed to improving the state university system. After 10 years at the helm, Dr. Austin stepped down in 2007, saying it was time for someone else to lead. 
 The university's 33-member search committee selected Dr. Hogan as its unanimous choice after a nationwide search. Now that Connecticut has been transformed into a modern campus with sparkling new buildings and programs that attract more of Connecticut's best students, who once fled the state for higher education, university officials said they wanted Dr. Hogan to take the university up another level. 
 ''A decade ago, the university did not have the campus to support a great academic program,'' said Dr. John W. Rowe, president of the university's board of trustees. ''The university has gone from being a safety school to much more selective. But we have a long way to go to be in the ranks of leading universities such as Michigan, California and North Carolina.''
 Dr. Hogan came from the University of Iowa, where he was executive vice president and provost. He was inaugurated in April, and as he looks toward his second academic year here, he must contend with the implications of a state budget deficit and a looming recession. He also inherits a $315 million endowment, smaller than those of many other public universities. 
 Dr. Hogan knows that if he is to make the school among the nation's best universities, he must improve several areas, but most important is its financial health.
 ''We're the only public university among the top 25 that does not have a $1 billion endowment fund,'' Dr. Hogan said. ''We need to work our way into that club.''
 To that end, the university also will soon announce a $450 million fund-raising drive, he said.
 U.S. News & World Report rates Connecticut the best public university in New England, and has Connecticut, Purdue University and Iowa tied for 24th in the nation. Dr. Hogan said that a major goal is to break into the magazine's list of top 20 public universities.
 ''We're supremely good among public universities and we're on a track to get better,'' Dr. Hogan said. 
 Dr. Hogan, 63, said he will work to raise academic standards, especially in the graduate schools. A handful already receive high marks in national rankings, like the Neag School of Education, ranked 12th among public universities and 21st among all universities by U.S. News & World Report, and the dental school, which consistently places its graduates in top-flight residencies. But many more are far down in the pack. A strategic plan for academic success, a chief focus of Dr. Hogan's, is due in September. He is optimistic.
 ''The quality of the applicant pool gets better every single year, and it's more diverse,'' he said.
 The average SAT score for incoming freshmen rose to about 1200 from 1192, more than 150 high school valedictorians and salutatorians are enrolling and 20 percent of the freshman class will be minority students, a fact Dr. Hogan points to with pride. The proportion of freshman minority students has increased more than 100 percent since 1995. 
 The state's investment in new buildings at Storrs and branches statewide, as well as the excitement generated by its nationally ranked basketball and football teams, drew more applicants this year to the university, officials said, so they decided to expand the entering class by 250 to a total of 3,400. 
 The university has almost 28,500 students -- about 23,500 of those at the Storrs campus. The university also has schools of law and social work in Hartford and West Hartford, respectively, five regional campuses and schools of medicine and dentistry at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington, which Dr. Hogan also oversees. The operation has a budget of $1.5 billion and employs 9,200.
 Dr. Rowe, the board president, who is also a professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, compared picking a new leader to finding a star decathlete. ''In order to win, the strategy is to score points in every event,'' he said. ''As we looked at the array of experience and capabilities and attributes of the candidates, Mike Hogan scored points in every event. He was a recognized scholar. The students loved him. The fund-raisers loved him.''
 Ryan McHardy, 25, the president of the student government, praised Dr. Hogan for his strong interest in improving academics and campus life for students. Mr. McHardy said Dr. Hogan has toured the campus with student leaders at night to discuss safety and other aspects of student activity.
 Dr. Hogan, who specializes in American diplomatic history, holds a bachelor's degree in English from the University of Northern Iowa and master's and Ph.D. degrees in history from the University of Iowa. 
 He held several positions at Ohio State University before going to University of Iowa, where he worked on university fund-raising efforts, student recruitment and programs to boost academic and research quality. 
 Dr. David J. Skorton, president of Cornell University, was president of the University of Iowa when he hired Dr. Hogan as executive vice president and provost in 2006.
 ''The main criterion for the faculty was someone who was a scholar and appreciated the role of faculty in higher education. He had a national reputation as an outstanding scholar,'' Mr. Skorton said. ''He is a humanist. He's a historian. Many universities have a heavy emphasis on bioscience, life sciences. Mike was as good with those faculties as he was with the liberal arts faculties. It's hard to do, and Mike did it well.''
 Dr. Hogan is committed to increasing the minority faculty, which is 11 percent. He plans a dedicated fund so that the school can offer larger salaries when competing for minority scholars.
 He also wants to increase the size of the faculty, now at about 1,400, by 125 positions. He believes the university could double its research grants, which currently are $190 million. The University of Connecticut Health Center's plan for a large new hospital has caused a furor among major hospitals in the Hartford region, which fear competition. Dr. Hogan seeks a collaboration so that the school and other medical facilities benefit mutually. He said doing otherwise would duplicate resources and risk the loss of large science grants.
 ''We could build world-class science and a world-famous location for treatment that provided high-paying jobs,'' Dr. Hogan said. ''That's why the hospitals have to stop fighting and cooperate. I feel very strongly about that.''

HEADLINE: Who Wants To Drive A Millionaire?

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
LET'S take the easy question first: Is the Koenigsegg CCX worth 669,000 euros, or $1.05 million in our currently scrawny American currency? For most owners of mere $200,000 Ferraris -- let alone mortals with $20,000 minivans -- the answer is an emphatic no.
 But for oil-drenched Saudis, collectors who have already lost count of the exotic cars in their garages and those driven to explore uncharted territory between 200 and 245 miles an hour -- otherwise known as freaks -- the 2008 Koenigsegg awaits. 
 Specifically, 35 Koenigseggs. That is roughly the annual worldwide production of this super Swede, giving the Koenigsegg the kind of exclusivity that makes a Porsche seem like a Pontiac. 
 Of course, most people know what a Porsche is. Some can even pronounce it correctly (with two syllables). Koenigsegg, in contrast, sounds like a high-end line of kitchen fixtures: ''Yeah, I went with the Koenigsegg six-burner range and the wine chiller to match.'' 
 For the record: the name is pronounced KOH-nig-segg and the machine won't braise a capon. But it does kick out the B.T.U.'s like few other cars, with 806 horsepower (1,018 in the ethanol-burning CCXR version) from a 4.7-liter V-8 with twin superchargers. 
 This ultralight supercar, built largely of carbon fiber, is the work of Christian von Koenigsegg, a designer and investor from a wealthy Swedish family. Mr. Koenigsegg, 36, has said that his inspiration came when he was 5 years old and his father took him to see a Norwegian puppet movie about a bicycle repairman who invents the world's greatest sports car. 
 Still in his mid-20s when he created his first prototype in 1996, Mr. Koenigsegg, who turned 36 last Wednesday, has built and sold a handful of cars since 2002, and this CCX is the first version that is street-legal in the United States. Like a long line of solo automakers before him, the effort marks Mr. Koenigsegg as either a visionary or an obsessed eccentric.
 After test-driving the car, I'd lean toward the former. The 'Segg is a sweetheart on the road, and for more than just its 3.2-second rip from 0 to 60 miles an hour; its quarter-mile run in 9.9 seconds at 146 m.p.h.; or its roughly 245 m.p.h. top speed. I suspect that most owners will never top 200, even on a closed track, or hire an unemployed racer to do it for them. Yet that top speed puts this velociraptor in the company of the world's fastest street cars, including the $1.4 million Bugatti Veyron and the even-more obscure SSC Ultimate Aero.
 Where some supercars, like the Saleen S7, are ill-suited to the street, the Koenigsegg is a Star Trek fantasy that manages to keep one boot on the earth.
 Yet a fantasy it is, a fact that was apparent when we backed the midengined Koenigsegg from a covered trailer in suburban New Jersey, accompanied by its owners from Universal Autosports. This recently opened exotic showroom in Glen Cove, on Long Island, will be one of only two Koenigsegg dealers in the United States.
 The improbable sight of the CCX on the streets of Englewood Cliffs, draped over the pavement like a shimmering electric-blue sea creature, made me burst out in laughter. The car seemed so improbable and so out of place that some passers-by barely noticed it -- the way you might react if you bumped into Scarlett Johansson at the 7-Eleven. But when a car nut spots the Koenigsegg, watch out: youngsters zigzaged through traffic to catch up for a precious cellphone shot. 
 While you might expect an overpowered kit car with rough edges, the Koenigsegg revealed handcrafted details inside and out. Unlike most scissor-type doors, which are cumbersome to operate or block your entry and exit, these ''dihedral synchro-helix'' doors are a feat of elegant engineering. Swing your arm outward as you would with a conventional portal, and the doors smoothly rotate forward while pivoting away from the body. Just take care not to whack a curb when opening the door.
 Yet this wouldn't be a supercar without some quirks and sacrifices. Wide door sills must be negotiated before you get comfy in the one-piece carbon-fiber buckets covered in Alcantara suede. (Headroom is notably good for such a low-riding machine). 
 The removable targa top hogs what little cargo space there is under the hood. There's virtually no rear visibility, only a back-up display screen that washes out in sunlight. The tachometer didn't even display the engine's redline. (Coming models will get a markedly upgraded instrument display). 
 My nitpicking duties completed, and with the dealership's owner, Giacomo Ciaccia, at my side, we headed north along the Hudson River toward West Point, N.Y. The Koenigsegg began to tug at its leash, eager to retrieve anything in its path. With the roof stowed, the superchargers-in-stereo whistled and gulped air behind my baking head. 
 I imagined some prince's test drive in Dubai, no different from his jet-fighter purchases: hold hands with salesman, hit throttle, observe shrieking-banshee routine, hand over suitcase containing $1 million. Third gear is good for 128 m.p.h., which leaves three speeds and another 117 m.p.h. to go. 
 Silly, sure. But also, for some of us, silly fun. 
 The steering is perfect for this type of machine: Fast and firm, but not twitchy like a racecar's. And give the Koenigsegg a medal for its six-speed manual transmission with a slender aluminum shift rod, an increasing rarity in this realm of sports car. (Finding a Ferrari with a manual these days is like stumbling onto Wonka's golden ticket). A sequential automated manual is available. 
 That shifter wasn't perfect; nailing upshifts from second to third took some practice. But the do-it-yourself action was a delight in this age of joyless robo-shifters. The clutch is heavy without feeling like a Bowflex workout. The brakes are tremendously powerful, yet linear, sensitive and not grabby around town. Lightweight carbon wheels are an extra $18,000 from an options list that includes carbon brake discs and a roll cage. Hey, why not? On this car, that's like tossing an extra $5 to the valet. 
 While the Koenigsegg felt as raw and bracing as a hurricane, it was also more approachable than some supercars I've driven from vastly larger, richer and more experienced companies. I'm thinking here of the Mercedes SLR McLaren and the Lamborghini Murcielago.
 And compared with the Bugatti, perhaps even more of a simple-Simon supercar, I'd give the Koenigsegg the edge. First, the Koenigsegg is a prettier way to spend seven figures. And I preferred the tactile sensations of its open roof, rear drive and manual transmission to the Bugatti's closed cockpit, all-wheel-drive and dual-clutch automatic. 
 Finally, at a twiggy 2,821 pounds, the Koenigsegg weighs about 1,400 less than the 4,200-pound Bugatti. All the Bugatti's glorious technology can't compensate for a poundage penalty equivalent to the original Mini.
 I know what you are thinking: it's positively obscene, when ordinary folks can't afford to fill their tanks, to heap praise on an over-the-top, Hi-Test-guzzling toy built for zillionaries?
 But think again: thanks largely to the car's slender weight and stellar aerodynamics, the fuel economy is shockingly good. With a federal mileage rating of 15 in town, 24 on the highway, the CCX avoids a gas-guzzler penalty.
 Some sports cars, like the Corvette Z06, have been described as a ticket waiting to happen. The Koenigsegg is like Guantanamo Bay waiting to happen.
 My blinding date with the car lasted roughly three hours. And while I was dying to take this Nordic supermodel home and show it off, I was also grateful to hand the keys back, my body and my driving record still unscathed. 
 INSIDE TRACK: Brother, can you spare a million?

HEADLINE: Newcomer's Rise Signals a Shift in Power

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES

DATELINE: PERTH AMBOY 

 BODY:
 AFTER a head-spinning six months in New Jersey politics -- which saw some of the most enduring leaders in the state moved aside by criminal convictions and retirement -- the latest newcomer got her turn at center stage last week.
 On Tuesday, Wilda Diaz -- a former bank executive, community organizer and mother of two -- was sworn in as mayor of Perth Amboy after her defeat of the 18-year incumbent, Joseph Vas, in the May 13 nonpartisan municipal election. Mr. Vas, who is also a state assemblyman, was seeking a fifth consecutive term. 
 Of four incumbents in high-profile municipal races, only Richard J. Martel, mayor of Mahwah, was able to stave off a challenge. Mayors in the three other cities -- Vineland, Cape May City and Perth Amboy -- were all sent to defeat, with Mr. Vas's ratio in defeat (by 61 percent to 39 percent) the largest and most surprising.
 With the conviction of former Mayor Sharpe James of Newark in federal court in April and the start of a legislative session in January that saw new members assume more than a quarter of the seats in the State Senate and the General Assembly, political analysts say victories like those by Ms. Diaz represent a significant generational shift in state politics. 
 The influx of new political figures could shift the balance of power within the Legislature and in towns like Perth Amboy across New Jersey, they say.
 ''Simply the number of oldsters who have left and have been replaced by youngsters who had experience, it's quite amazing,'' said Ingrid Reed, of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. ''It's hard to know right now what difference it will make. Will it still be the same party allegiances? Will the heads of the large bodies simply find ways of exercising their power within this new group? Are we going to see something different in Trenton? We don't know. But it certainly is a new generation.''
 Ms. Diaz, 43, is also the first Latina mayor in New Jersey.
 ''People want new ideas and new talent,'' Ms. Diaz said in a telephone interview. ''And people want to give other people an opportunity.''
 While Ms. Diaz almost seems to shrug off her victory as the byproduct of old-fashioned shoe-leather campaigning, Ms. Reed said that the ouster of Mr. Vas was a result of a well-organized campaign that tapped into a reservoir of discontent among the town's 40,000 residents.
 ''None of this would have worked without the leadership skills and organizational skills and sense of identity in Perth Amboy to prevail over the countervailing electorate to pull this off,'' Ms. Reed said.
 Ms. Diaz seized on voter concerns about taxes and a public relations misstep by Mr. Vas, who invoked several municipal ordinances to oppose the staging of a Puerto Rican Day Parade. She also questioned whether Mr. Vas's role as a dual officeholder hampered his effectiveness as mayor.
 ''You need a full-time mayor,'' Ms. Diaz said. ''Every time you turned around he was running for something. He's an assemblyman, he was a mayor and two years ago he ran for Congress.''
 Mr. Vas has deflected those criticisms and pointed to his work in helping revitalize Perth Amboy's waterfront and other parts of its economy over the past two decades.
 ''No regrets,'' he said simply on Election Night. 
 Ms. Reed said that she saw some parallels between Mr. Vas's defeat and the way Cory A. Booker assumed the mayor's office in 2006 shortly after Mr. James decided not to seek a sixth term.
 ''They're both big guys, larger than life, they were seen as bosses and were vulnerable to what happens when you're held power for a long time: you feel invincible and don't really see what's coming,'' Ms. Reed said.
 Even Mr. Vas's supporters acknowledged that he might have succumbed to the kind of centrifugal forces that have forced other longtime incumbents from office in recent months.
 ''Change is one of the big issues today,'' said Joseph Spicuzzo, chairman of the Middlesex County Democratic Party, noting that candidates ranging from the probable Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama to Ms. Diaz have keyed on that message. ''There's an awful lot of young people that were not involved in politics who are getting involved. I think that's good for the Democratic Party.''
 Although, perhaps, not necessarily so for the incumbents.

HEADLINE: A Corporate Detective Is Saying Farewell

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN, MICHELLE LEDER, PHYLLIS KORKKI, ELIZABETH OLSON, ERIC SYLVERS

 BODY:
Jules B. Kroll has turned up in some of the most visible cases involving corporate forensics. 
 It all started 36 years ago, after Mr. Kroll made a bid to become a councilman at large in Queens but failed. Drawing on his background as a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan and his experience in the family printing business, he began consulting for corporate purchasing departments that were concerned about inefficiency or were suspecting corruption. 
 Mr. Kroll and the firm that emerged, Kroll Inc., became pioneers in modern corporate security and intelligence. Now, at age 67, Mr. Kroll is retiring from the company, which was acquired by the Marsh & McLennan Companies in 2004. 
 He says his most memorable case was when the Kuwaiti government hired the firm to look for Saddam Hussein's hidden assets and arms procurement network after Iraq invaded Kuwait in the early 1990s. Forty people worked full time for two years digging into public filings as part of that effort, Mr. Kroll said.
 His firm also did work for the family of Roberto Calvi, a financier with ties to the Vatican who was found hanging from a London bridge in 1982. (First ruled a suicide, the death was later called a murder and remains unsolved.) Kroll also worked for a government-appointed administrator in Italy after $5 billion assumed to be in a bank account of the dairy company Parmalat was found not to be in the account. (Parmalat sued its banks; the banks denied wrongdoing.) 
 Mr. Kroll said technology had made his work more accurate and efficient in recent years. But, he added, people are crucial: ''Technology is no substitute for a really good source.''

 A BIG MOVE Last month, CTC Media, one of Russia's largest independent media companies, announced that it had named Anton Kudryashov, 40, to be its new chief executive. Mr. Kudryashov is expected to start on Aug. 4. 
 But first he has to move to Moscow from London. To help ease his transition, CTC agreed to cover ''reasonable out-of-pocket expenses'' related to Mr. Kudryashov's move. The limit on those expenses? Up to $1 million, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 
 Among the items listed in the executive's employment letter as reimbursable expenses are hotel accommodations in Moscow, up to 18 months of temporary housing in the city, broker fees and business-class airfare for Mr. Kudryashov and his immediate family between London and Moscow for the next 18 months. 
 A spokeswoman for CTC Media declined to comment.

 CLOUDY FORECAST The chief executives out there are depressed. Since 2002, Chief Executive magazine has regularly surveyed top leaders at American companies about their business outlook. The most recent survey was in mid-June. ''This is as pessimistic as we've seen,'' said Edward M. Kopko, the magazine's chairman and publisher. 
 When a chief executive gets depressed, it's not the same as when the average worker or consumer feels low. Plants aren't built, big projects lose investors, stores are closed (witness Starbucks) and jobs are lost. 
 Can anything positive be taken out of this gloomy assessment? Yes, Mr. Kopko says: ''It's hard to make the case that it can go much lower,'' he said.

 LUXE BARGAIN Even if the slumping economy means that some people have to give up the priciest fine dining, at least a taste of luxury is still to be had. 
 Aux Delices des Bois Black Truffle Butter, which costs $7.99 a tub, won the outstanding new product award last week at the Fancy Food Show held by the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade.
 The butter, which won out over 600 entries, was selected by an independent panel of specialty food experts. It is made by Transatlantic Foods of Manhattan, owned by Francois Baumont and Thierry Farges. The company was honored with a gold statue of a chef that resembles an Oscar. In addition to possessing the statue and bragging rights, Transatlantic Foods can also label its butter as a winner of the award.

 A FAMILIAR FACE Telecom Italia, in flux as its management and its strategies change, has called on an executive with a long view of the company's history to become its chief financial officer. Marco Patuano, now general manager of operations, is to assume the post on Aug. 8, after first-half results are approved by the board. He joined the company in 1990, when it was a state-run monopoly. 
 Mr. Patuano will succeed Enrico Parazzini, one of several executives who decided to leave after Franco Bernabe became chief executive late last year. Mr. Patuano will oversee the finances of Telecom Italia as it seeks to cut costs while keeping up with competitors in Italy and abroad.

 BODY:
FAIR GAME: How a Top Spy Was Betrayed by Her Own Government, by Valerie Plame Wilson. (Simon & Schuster, $15.) The columnist Robert Novak ended Valerie Plame Wilson's career when he identified her as a C.I.A. officer in 2003, and she wrote this book both to settle scores and to support her family. After reviewing the manuscript, the C.I.A. demanded many deletions; the book includes the censor's marks as well as an afterword by a reporter who uses the public record to fill in gaps. ''Fair Game,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The Times, shows Wilson as ''an ambitious, gung-ho professional.'' 
 Norman Pearlstine was the editor in chief of Time Inc. when Patrick Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor investigating the leak of Wilson's identity, subpoenaed the notes of the Time reporter Matt Cooper, and he was widely criticized when he decided to turn them over. In OFF THE RECORD: The Press, the Government, and the War Over Anonymous Sources (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15, Pearlstine questions whether the news media have a right to keep their sources secret. 
 THE PESTHOUSE, by Jim Crace. (Vintage, $13.95.) Here is another postapocalyptic road trip through the ruined wasteland of earth after some unspecified future war. In the British novelist's version, two survivors find each other -- ''the dying-planet version of the boy-girl meet,'' our reviewer, Francine Prose, said -- and struggle to survive. 
 NAPOLEON'S EGYPT: Invading the Middle East, by Juan Cole. (Palgrave Macmillan, $16.95.) Napoleon's invasion of Egypt -- the first modern incursion by the West into the Middle East -- is often remembered as the beginning of Egyptology or a template for Napoleon's later campaigns. But Cole, who teaches history at the University of Michigan and blogs about United States policy in the Middle East, presents the invasion and occupation through Egyptian eyes. From this perspective the offensive seems premonitory in its ambitions (Napoleon tried to establish a pro-French representative government and to modernize Cairo) and its results (a brutal insurgency). 
 BANGKOK HAUNTS, by John Burdett. (Vintage, $13.95.) Burdett's hero, a half-Thai Buddhist cop with a cheerfully corrupt boss, is haunted by the vengeful ghost of a former prostitute (once the love of his life) who was murdered in a snuff film. Writing in the Book Review, Marilyn Stasio praised the ''hallucinatory brand of Southeast Asian magic'' on display in Burdett's third Bangkok thriller. 
 THE SHOCK DOCTRINE: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, by Naomi Klein. (Picador, $16.) Klein's ambitious appraisal of the rise of free-market fundamentalism argues that the market depends on ''the power of shock'' in order to force its economic policies on resisting countries. She coins the term ''disaster capitalism'' to describe ''orchestrated raids on the public sphere in the wake of catastrophic events,'' like the privatization of New Orleans public schools after Hurricane Katrina or the attempt to create a free-market Iraq after 9/11. But she ends on a hopeful note, pointing to community efforts at reconstruction in places like post-tsunami Sri Lanka. 
 THE SUMMER OF 1787: The Men Who Invented the Constitution, by David O. Stewart. (Simon & Schuster, $15.) Stewart, a lawyer specializing in constitutional cases, retells the familiar story, evoking the atmosphere of the Constitutional Convention and reviewing its debates and compromises. 
 FLOWER CHILDREN, by Maxine Swann. (Riverhead, $14.) This lyrical and nostalgic novel in stories follows four children and their eccentric parents in a hippie family in the 1970s. ''They're free to run anywhere they like whenever they like, so they do,'' it begins. 
 UNCOMMON ARRANGEMENTS: Seven Marriages, by Katie Roiphe. (Dial, $14.) Seven couples in London between 1910 and World War II -- literary or artistic figures famous in their time and in the habit of writing everything down -- are the focus of Roiphe's examination of marriage in an era of cultural change. The relationships existed in a ''bubble where money problems and children are never allowed to intrude,'' our reviewer, Tina Brown, said. Nevertheless, ''the way the alpha women of Bloomsbury wrestled with their need for love while producing work of the highest quality should be an inspiration.'' 
 THE LAST MRS. ASTOR: A New York Story, by Frances Kiernan. (Norton, $15.95.) This guardedly admiring biography of Brooke Astor, who died last summer at the age of 105, barely discusses the accusations of elder abuse in her final years. Instead, it focuses on Astor as a leader of New York society and a philanthropist; under her guidance the Vincent Astor Foundation donated $200 million to New York cultural and charitable institutions. 
 SUMMER READING, by Hilma Wolitzer. (Ballantine, $14.) An Amagansett book club called the Page Turners is the focus of Wolitzer's breezy novel. Three women brought together by the meetings are gently nudged by their reading toward growth and happy endings.

 BODY:
GAMING THE VOTE Why Elections Aren't Fair (and What We Can Do About It). By William Poundstone. Hill & Wang, $25.
 Americans' most recent encounter with ''the spoiler effect'' was in 2000, when Ralph Nader diverted enough votes from Al Gore in Florida, at least one poll suggested, to tip the election to George W. Bush. By Poundstone's reckoning, four other presidential races were probably skewed by minor-party candidates -- ''an 11 percent rate of catastrophic failure,'' he writes. Alternative voting systems have been suggested over the years, but objections have been raised to those as well. The ''approval voting'' method, for instance, in which voters can cast ballots for as many candidates as they like, might well have resulted in a Ross Perot presidency. 
The economist Kenneth Arrow went so far as to construct a proof that no voting system could be reliably fair. But a method that Arrow might not have properly considered is gaining adherents. ''Range voting,'' in which voters rate each candidate on, say, a scale of one to five, produces the least dissatisfying results of any practical voting system, according to a 2000 study. Poundstone, the author of 10 previous books, has the popular science writer's knack for wrapping difficult material in enticing anecdotes. How can you not be seduced by a book that uses the Hot or Not Web site to illustrate range voting? There's just one problem: range voting has about as much chance of being widely adopted as Ralph Nader has of becoming president. Poundstone can muster only a feeble response to his own question about the major parties: ''What's in it for them?''
 AMALIA'S TALE An Impoverished Peasant Woman, an Ambitious Attorney, and a Fight for Justice. By David I. Kertzer. Houghton Mifflin, $24.
 Amalia Bagnacavalli, an illiterate peasant from a mountain hamlet, ''could only have gawked,'' writes Kertzer, when she arrived in 1890 at the massive city wall of bustling Bologna. She had gone to take on a baby from a foundling hospital as a wet nurse for a fee of 9 lire per month. Five months later, suffering from the syphilis she had contracted from the foundling (and passed on to her infant daughter and husband), Bagnacavalli returned to Bologna, to the law office of Augusto Barbieri. Challenging the city's medical establishment, Barbieri tenaciously fought a decade-long, pioneering malpractice lawsuit to force the foundling hospital to compensate Bagnacavalli. Kertzer, the provost of Brown University and the author of several books on Italian history, keeps in the background of his courtroom drama the class tensions between the unbowed nobility, the ascendant professionals and the radicalized poor in a modernizing post-Risorgimento Italy. Barbieri's aristocratic foil and chief opponent was Count Francesco Isolani, the president of Bologna's hospital board. Kertzer resists the temptation to glorify Barbieri, who didn't seem so liberal when Bagnacavalli's bill came due, or to vilify Isolani, who was tormented by the case and by the agonizing revision to hospital procedure it prompted: to protect wet nurses, babies with any sign of syphilis were fed animals' milk, which in the age before pasteurization meant death for the majority of them. Kertzer handles the medical and legal details with confidence in this book, which is of modest scale but brims with compassion and insight.
 COVERT My Years Infiltrating the Mob. By Bob Delaney with Dave Scheiber. Union Square, $19.95.
 As a 23-year-old New Jersey state trooper, Delaney was enlisted in 1975 to go under cover for Project Alpha, a groundbreaking organized crime investigation. With the help of a consigliere-turned-informant named Patrick Kelly, he gained access to some of the era's top crime bosses. Acting as president of a front business, Alamo Trucking, Delaney over the course of more than two years collected 400 hours of recordings that provided prosecutors with a virtual encyclopedia of shakedown artists and their methodologies. The operation ended with the arrest of 35 suspects. A mob-infiltration memoir for the ''Sopranos'' age, ''Covert'' has a postmodern self-consciousness about Mafia mythology, shared by the wise guys who mimic poses from ''The Godfather.'' Also like ''The Sopranos,'' ''Covert'' struggles to update a genre steeped in now-unfashionable ethnic caricature, with Delaney fondly recalling his hometown neighborhood, ''where there were no Mafia guys, but they were all Italians.'' Psychotherapy even plays a role, when Delaney learns he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder during informal consultations with a psychology professor. There was great potential in this tale of a thoughtful lawman adapting to the thug life, but ''Covert,'' while entertaining, lacks the nuance to do the story justice. There is a final twist. A decade after he emerged from undercover work, Delaney made a radical career change: he became an N.B.A. referee. Last month, Delaney was accused by a fellow referee of helping to manipulate a disputed 2002 playoff game. (He has denied any wrongdoing.) In any case, he writes here, his basketball recollections will ''have to wait for another book.''
 TWO WEEKS OF LIFE A Memoir of Love, Death, and Politics. By Eleanor Clift. Basic Books, $26.
 For five years after receiving a diagnosis of kidney cancer, Clift's husband, the journalist Tom Brazaitis, valiantly endured a full complement of excruciating treatments. When his options ran out, he submitted with some reluctance to home hospice care. The book's account of two weeks in March 2005 alternates between the quiet intimacy of Brazaitis's deathbed and the noisy public battle over the fate of Terri Schiavo, who had been in a persistent vegetative state for nearly 15 years. Clift respectfully portrays some of the conservative activists who supported the effort of Schiavo's parents to prevent her husband from having her feeding tube removed. She is less tolerant of the members of Congress who mistakenly believed that intervening on behalf of Schiavo's parents would be politically advantageous. Loosely constructed and sometimes unfocused, ''Two Weeks of Life'' never resolves its contrasting narratives into a sustained argument about the American way of death. But Clift's reporting on the Schiavo ordeal is thorough, and her tender description of her husband's exemplary death demonstrates how hospice care can help achieve what she calls a ''more peaceful ushering in of the inevitable.''

HEADLINE: Virginia Weighs Future of Historic Fort After Army Leaves

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HAMPTON, Va. 

 BODY:
Fort Monroe, a Union oasis where fugitive slaves flocked during the Civil War, will return to Virginia's control in 2011 when the Army pulls out, and historians are trying to protect the future of the so-called Freedom Fortress.
 Many slave descendants trace the arrival of slavery in the United States in 1619 to Old Point Comfort, the hatchet-shaped peninsula where Fort Monroe sits, and where slavery would be ushered into its final stages nearly 250 years later. 
 ''When you look at how immigrants went to Ellis Island, our people couldn't do this,'' said Gerri L. Hollins, who counts a fugitive slave among her ancestors. ''This is our Ellis Island.''
 Some want to see the fort become a national park. A state-appointed authority on Monday presented a reuse plan to Gov. Tim Kaine that proposes preservation and strict limits on new development.
 The panel, called the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority, is determining how best to tell the fort's history, and descendants of slaves who found their freedom there are hoping that their story will be featured.
 It was at Fort Monroe in May 1861 that the stage would be set for the demise of slavery, almost two years before Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. A Union commander declared that three fugitive slaves there were contraband, war spoils, effectively freeing them.
 The gesture sent a flood of slaves to Fort Monroe in what some historians say is one of the most powerful events of the Civil War.
 ''Slaves did not stand around in the fields singing spirituals waiting for the Union Army to save them,'' said Ervin L. Jordan Jr., a University of Virginia research archivist and Civil War historian. ''Slaves knew what freedom was, and they knew how to get it.''
 While the Defense Department will review proposals for the future of the fort, known as the Gibraltar of the Chesapeake in its 35 years as the home of the Army Training and Doctrine Command, Mr. Kaine or his successor will have the final say. A spokesman for the governor, Gordon Hickey, said Mr. Kaine expected any plans to honor the history of Fort Monroe, keep it free and open to the public and make it economically sound.
 The group Citizens for a Fort Monroe National Park envisions an economically sustainable national park similar to the Presidio, the former Army base in San Francisco that is now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The group is fearful that the state, which has struggled to address growing transportation demands, will be financially unable to sustain the fort, a National Historic Landmark.
 The six-sided, 63-acre fortress sealed by 1.3 miles of granite is the last active moated fort in the United States. The property includes 264 government buildings and housing, and a majority of the buildings are deemed historic.
 A National Park Service study issued in May concluded that while Fort Monroe was a national treasure, the service would need a ''strong and sustainable partner'' to help manage, maintain and operate it once the military moved on.
 H. O. Malone, the retired chief historian at Fort Monroe who lived on the base, now heads Citizens for a Fort Monroe National Park. He said the group was not deterred by the conclusions of the Park Service study, which he said had been misinterpreted.
 ''They haven't said no,'' Mr. Malone said. ''First of all, what they said is, 'Yes, Fort Monroe does measure up to be a national park.' ''
 Mr. Malone's group anticipates tourism dollars and limited leasing of base buildings would generate the revenue needed to shore up Park Service resources.
 William A. Armbruster, executive director of the authority studying the base's future, said historical purists should not fear limited development, provided it was consistent with the history of the fort. He said large-scale development was not likely.
 ''It is a treasure that we want to protect,'' Mr. Armbruster said of the fort. ''We want future generations to say, 'Thank God, we got it right.' ''

HEADLINE: New Bank to Focus on Clients Underserved by Bigger Institutions

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
 WHO would open a new bank in tough economic times like these?
 Investors in the Westchester Bank, which opened its doors here on Central Park Avenue last month, think the timing couldn't be better -- especially for a small community bank like theirs. 
 The bank is focusing on small and medium-size businesses, many of which are getting a cold shoulder from bigger banks in these days of bank mergers and acquisitions and dwindling credit. 
 ''It leaves a void in the marketplace when big banks only tackle the larger clients and can't be bothered by loans of $1.5 million or less,'' said W. Thomas Clark, chairman of the board of the Westchester Bank and formerly an executive at Morgan Stanley. ''So that's the niche we're filling.'' 
 The private start-up is only the fourth new bank in the county in 37 years. 
 Hudson Valley Bank, the largest independently owned commercial bank in Westchester, opened in 1972 and has become a far larger institution with branches in Rockland County, the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens and Fairfield County, Conn. The State Bank of Westchester opened in 1986, changed its name to Reliance Bank and was ultimately acquired by Union State Bank, which has since been acquired by Key Bank. USA Bank, a small community bank in Port Chester, opened two and a half years ago and has a branch in Rye Brook. The Westchester Bank and USA are the only community banks in the county.
 Since the late 1980s, regulatory changes and increased competition, coupled with narrower profit margins, have left many community banks vulnerable to acquisition. In the wake of such mergers, start-up banks often flourish -- a pattern that is being seen throughout the country, said George E. Dunkel, president and chief executive of the Westchester Bank, who was the founding president of the Community Bank of Sullivan County.
 On Long Island, for example, several banks have opened in recent years after a spate of mergers, and more start-ups are on the drawing board. In Westchester, like Long Island, there are many banking outlets, but they are branches of larger institutions, where, Mr. Dunkel said, personal service is in short supply.
 ''In our new building, my office will be on the ground floor so people can talk to me whenever they want,'' he said.
 The Westchester Bank, which operates out of a trailer now, is building a two-story, 8,000-square-foot headquarters on its property. 
 The idea for the bank was hatched about four years ago, with 150 investors raising $3 million for its charter. ''We were actually oversubscribed,'' Mr. Clark said. ''At a time when the financial services industry is taking it on the chin, it validated our belief that there's a driving need for a bank like ours.''
 But because many regional and small banks are staggering under a mounting volume of bad construction loans made to homebuilders, Mr. Dunkel said the new bank ''will not be involved in the housing cycle at all.''
 Instead, it will focus on businesses like doctors' groups, which often need loans to pay their annual malpractice insurance premiums and maintain a cash flow, or small manufacturers ready to expand their quarters or buy new equipment. 
 One of the bank's first loans was a $1.3 million mortgage taken out by the owner of a packaging company who was renting space in a Yonkers warehouse and wanted to buy the building. ''We know the businessman,'' Mr. Dunkel said. ''He's well established, but larger banks just won't make loans to someone like this.''
 In Port Chester, Ronald J. Gentile, the president and chief executive officer of USA Bank, said that quick decisions on loans were especially important for smaller businesses. 
 ''The bigger banks often keep them hanging on, saying the loan application has to go to this committee or that one,'' Mr. Gentile said. ''Our customers may not always get the answer they want from us, but they'll get it promptly. In a community bank, the decision-making isn't made by some underwriter sitting miles away who doesn't even know you.''

HEADLINE: Short-Straw Economics

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
You're a professor of public policy at Berkeley and a former U.S. secretary of labor in the Clinton administration -- what can you tell us about the gas-pump crisis as we set out on the road this July 4th weekend? Now that gas is at $4 a gallon, people are deserting their cars for trains and buses and, where available, light rail. We haven't seen a transition on this scale away from cars ever before. 
 But you can't take light rail to most backyard picnics in America. No, public transit has been the poor stepchild of infrastructure spending in America. We've poured tens of billions into an Interstate highway system and our state road system; in effect we have subsidized the automobile. 
 What do you make of the argument that the only way to lessen our dependence on foreign oil is to tap more oil wells here -- in Alaska and off the coasts of Florida and California? When you consider that the oil we pump goes into a global oil market, offshore drilling makes no sense. We take the environmental risk, but we'd have to share the negligible price gains with Chinese consumers and every other user around the world. 
 Then why do you think President Bush asked Congress last month to lift the longtime ban on offshore oil drilling? If I had to guess, I would say that President Bush is very close to the oil companies and wants whatever they want. 
 And what they want is license to drill? I think they would like as many licenses and permits as possible granted during the Bush administration. They know they would have a harder time with a Democratic White House. 
 We should point out that you are known to be an unreconstructed liberal, although that's probably true of just about everyone in Berkeley. Labels mean less and less. Berkeley is wonderful, but here I am on the right of most arguments. 
 Have you spoken to the Clintons lately? I put in a call to Hillary before I endorsed Obama but have not heard back. I wanted to tell her myself. 
 Did you feel torn about endorsing Obama after your long relationship with the Clintons, your classmates at Yale Law School? I felt very torn. I was even torn when I was in the cabinet. As Bill moved to the right once Dick Morris came in, I was disappointed. 
 I read somewhere that you and Hillary dated when she was still at Wellesley. To call it a date is an exaggeration. She and I went out to see Antonioni's ''Blow-Up.'' The only thing I remember is that she wanted what seemed to me to be an extraordinary amount of butter on her popcorn. 
 Only an economist could go on a date and study trends in butter consumption. Isn't that a kind of wonky thing to remember? Yes, it is. I recall the extra butter costing more. 
 What kind of car does the author of ''Supercapitalism'' drive? I drive a Mini Cooper. It gets about 30 miles a gallon. It holds four of my-size people. 
 What size is that, exactly? I'm 4-foot-10 1/2. 
 Are there any economic advantages to being short? There are many. I use far fewer calories than the average person. I am much more economically and environmentally sustainable. I exhale less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. I use up less space. I have a little house.
 What are the disadvantages of shortness? I was bullied a lot when I was a kid. I was actually beat up because I was little. People frequently tell me in interviews that they were bullied as children. But no one ever steps forward and says, ''I was the bully.'' They don't want to admit to being a bully. 
 What do you think playground bullies grow up to be? Right-wing Republicans.

HEADLINE: Cashing In On Obama And McCain

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD AND GRIFF PALMER

 BODY:
JOHN McCAIN and Barack Obama are not the only winners to emerge from the long presidential primary season. 
 The two presumptive nominees, along with the many candidates who bowed out along the way, spent more than $900 million through the end of May, about $470 million more than was spent on primaries in 2000, when both major parties last had competitive primary battles. Nearly half of the current spending has been paid to just a few dozen companies. 
 Before November, hundreds of additional millions will be paid to the lucky few businesses that have contracts with the winning candidates for campaign necessities like media consulting, airplane charters, direct mail and telemarketing. And as campaign schedules become more crowded, companies that coordinate rallies and events, and those that make signs and bumper stickers, will also rake in dollars.
 Even companies that do not cater to the political arena can reap great rewards, according to spending records each candidate has filed with the Federal Election Commission. Bank of America and American Express together received about $7 million in credit card and banking fees from the Obama campaign alone. Verizon was paid more than $4 million by all the candidates combined to put phones into the hands of their employees.
 To be sure, some of the companies that received the highest payments passed the money on to other vendors. The Obama campaign, for example, paid $85 million to GMMB, a media consulting firm. But $69 million of that was used to buy advertising time, which means that much of the money paid to GMMB ended up at local television and radio stations. 
 Some experts say they think that as campaign spending rises, the candidates benefit much less than the companies. ''The total amount of money doesn't matter, especially since you start to see diminishing returns,'' said Ray C. Fair, an economist at Yale who studies economic influences on presidential elections. ''What matters is the difference in spending between the two parties.''
 With Mr. Obama opting out of public financing and expecting to raise upward of $300 million between now and November, it looks like he may be able to far outspend Mr. McCain, who has pledged to accept public financing and is limited to spending $85 million in the general election. Of course, the candidates are not alone in the political spendfest. The Republican and Democratic National Committees and groups that are created specifically to influence elections, like 527's, will spend tens of millions of dollars in the general election. 
 It's feast or famine. Businesses expand rapidly to meet the demands of a voracious campaign, then downsize just as fast when a campaign abruptly ends.
 Tigereye Designs, of Greenville, Ohio, which provides the Obama campaign with most of its buttons, banners and yard signs, quintupled its staff since the campaign season began. It has made more than one million bumper stickers for Democratic candidates this year.
 ''It's like having a whale wash up on the beach,'' said Justin Hemminger, the political program director at Tigereye. ''You want to shovel food in the whale as fast as possible before the tide turns. We're all out there with shovels.''

HEADLINE: Late-Period Limbaugh

BYLINE: By ZEV CHAFETS. 
Zev Chafets is a frequent contributor to the magazine. His last cover story was about Mike Huckabee.

 BODY:
'The Rush Limbaugh Show' goes on the air every weekday at 12:06 P.M. Eastern Time.
 At one time, Limbaugh did his program from a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper he dubbed, with tongue-in-cheek grandiosity, the Excellence in Broadcasting Building. These days, he mostly broadcasts out of a studio in Palm Beach, Fla., which he calls the Southern Command, and describes on the air as a ''heavily fortified bunker.''
 In fact, Limbaugh's show emanates from a nondescript office building on a boulevard lined with tall palms. There isn't even a security guard in the lobby. The elevator opens directly onto a pristine anteroom furnished in corporate glass and leather. An American flag stands in the corner. Only a small, framed picture of Limbaugh, bearing the caption ''America's Anchorman,'' reveals that this is the headquarters of one of the country's most admired and reviled figures. 
 The anteroom was empty when I stepped off the elevator one afternoon in mid-February. Limbaugh receives very few visitors at work, and no journalists from the hated ''mainstream media.'' When I was buzzed into the control room, I was met by Bo Snerdly -- a very large man in a Huey Newton beret -- who glared at me. ''Are you the guy who's here to do the hit job on us?'' he demanded in a deep voice.
 ''Absolutely,'' I said. 
 Snerdly, whose real name is James Golden, held my eyes for a long moment before bursting into emphatic laughter.
 ''It's just that we aren't used to seeing reporters here,'' said a woman named Dawn. She is a stenographer whom Limbaugh hired in 2001, after he went deaf. These days he has a cochlear implant that enables him to hear callers, but Dawn sends him real-time transcripts of on-air conversations, just in case. 
 ''The media doesn't know about this place,'' she said. ''They don't know where we are. During Rush's big drug story they staked out the whole town, even his house, but they never found us here.''
 For the next hour I sat behind the glass panel of the control booth and watched Limbaugh at work in front of the ''golden E.I.B. microphone.'' Unlike Howard Stern or Don Imus, he has no sidekicks with him in the room. He does, however, keep up a running conversation with an unheard voice. I always assumed that this was just imaginary radio shtick. Now I saw that the voice was attached to a human interlocutor, Snerdly, who banters with and occasionally badgers Limbaugh via an internal talk-back circuit.
 After the broadcast, Limbaugh waved me into the studio and offered me a seat directly across from him. The room's acoustics make it relatively easy for him to hear, but he also reads lips. 
 I had come to talk to Limbaugh about his role in Republican Party politics. During the primaries he assailed John McCain as a phony conservative and apostate Reaganite. Despite Limbaugh's best efforts, it now appeared that the Arizona senator would be the nominee. There was speculation that Limbaugh would not support him in November.
 ''I've never even met the man, never spoken to him,'' Limbaugh said. ''I'm sure there are things about him I'd like if we meet. This isn't personal.'' He then delivered a litany of the presumptive nominee's personal failings -- too old, too intense, too opportunistic, too liberal. But, he assured me, he would be with McCain in the fall. ''It's like the Super Bowl,'' he told me. ''If your team isn't in it, you root for the team you hate less. That's McCain.'' 
 It already seemed, when I made my visit, that McCain's opponent might well be Senator Obama, and I was curious to know how Limbaugh planned to take on America's first African-American major-party nominee. ''I'll approach Obama with fearless honesty,'' said Limbaugh, who speaks of himself in heroic terms on air and off. ''He's a liberal. I oppose liberals. That's all that's involved here.''
 I asked if he had any specific tactics in mind.
 ''I haven't yet figured that out exactly,'' he said. ''You know, I've had a problem with substance abuse. I don't deal with the future anymore. I take things one day at a time.''
 In this case, it took two. I was back in New York, listening to the radio, when I heard Limbaugh say: ''Ladies and gentlemen, I had a conversation with a friend Wednesday afternoon after the program, and he said, 'Nobody's criticizing Obama. How are you going to do this? How are you going to handle criticizing the first black American to run for president?' I said: 'I'm going to do it the way I always do it. First, at the top of the list, I'm going to do it fearlessly. I'm not going to bow to political correctness. I'm going to do it with humor. I'm going to focus on the issues. I'm going to react to what he says. Simple. I'm going to do it just like it were any other case -- he's a man, right? He's a liberal. How do I criticize liberals? I criticize them.' But I have devised, ladies and gentlemen, an even more creative way of criticizing Obama. I have, just this morning, named a new position here on the staff that is the Official Obama Criticizer. The E.I.B. Network now has an Official Obama Criticizer. He is Bo Snerdly.''
 Snerdly introduced himself as an ''African-American-in-good-standing-and-certified-black-enough-to-criticize-Obama guy,'' and declared that he was speaking, ''on behalf of our E.I.B. brothers and sisters in the hood.'' The bit was typical Limbaugh -- confrontational, deliberately insensitive and funny. It was also a declaration of independence. Whatever special courtesies John McCain might plan to extend to Barack Obama, Limbaugh is going to conduct his air war, as he always has, by his own rules of engagement.
 ON AUG. 1, LIMBAUGH WILL CELEBRATE the 20th anniversary of his national radio program. At 57, he is an American icon, although his fans and critics don't agree on precisely what he is iconic for. I've heard him compared to Mark Twain and Jackie Gleason, the Founding Fathers and Father Coughlin. Serious people have called him a serial liar and a moral philosopher, a partisan hack and a public intellectual, nothing more than a radio windbag and nothing less than the heart of the Republican Party.
 One thing is certain: Limbaugh has been a partisan force for two decades. In 1994, he was so influential in the Republican Congressional landslide that the grateful winners made him an honorary member of the G.O.P. freshman class. He moved not only voters, but the party itself. ''Rush talked about the 'Contract With America' before there was a 'Contract With America,' '' Karl Rove told me. ''He helped set the agenda.''
 Limbaugh has been a factor in every national election of the past 20 years, but not since the mid-1990s has he been so prominent. Democrats have blamed him for everything from invading their primaries to starting scurrilous rumors about Michelle Obama. Limbaugh denies the latter accusation, but he happily embraces the former. His vehicle was so-called Operation Chaos, a radio campaign designed to encourage Republicans to vote for Hillary Clinton and prolong internecine fighting among liberals.
 Nobody quite knows how effective Operation Chaos was. Karl Rove said he thinks it helped tilt Texas for Clinton. She herself gave this some credence on the day after the vote by jauntily saying, ''Be careful what you wish for, Rush.'' Howard Dean implored primary voters in Indiana and North Carolina to ignore Limbaugh. The Obama supporter Arianna Huffington called Limbaugh and other conservative hosts ''toxic curiosities.'' After Clinton won in Indiana, where 10 percent of Democratic primary voters admitted to exit pollsters that they were really Republicans, Senator John Kerry accused Limbaugh of ''tampering with the primary'' and causing Obama's defeat.
 Limbaugh was delighted. He deemed Operation Chaos to have ''exceeded all expectations'' (his customary self-evaluation) and explained once again that he wasn't supporting Clinton but merely trying to bloody Obama because John McCain was too chicken to do it and because he believed that Obama would then be easier to beat in November.
 Probably both the Democrats and Limbaugh overstated his actual impact. But Operation Chaos was a triumph of interactive political performance art. Limbaugh appointed himself Supreme Commander, deputized his listeners and turned them into merry pranksters. ''Rush is a master at framing an issue and creating a community around it,'' says Susan Estrich, who ran Michael Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign and has since become a talk-show host herself. Operation Chaos drew a crowd, which is what Limbaugh does for a living. It got people laughing at the Democrats, which is what he lives for. And, ever the devout capitalist, he turned an extra buck by peddling Operation Chaos gear. The stuff flew off the cybershelves of the E.I.B. store, the biggest seller since his Club Gitmo collection (''my mullah went to Club Gitmo and all I got was this lousy T-shirt'').
 None of these high jinks would have mattered if Limbaugh were a regular radio personality. But he isn't. Michael Harrison, the editor and publisher of Talkers magazine, a trade publication, puts Limbaugh's weekly audience at 14 million. Limbaugh himself says it is closer to 20 million. Either way, nobody else is close. He has been the top-rated radio talk-show host in America since the magazine started the ranking 17 years ago. 
 Such massive and consistent popularity makes Limbaugh a singular political force. ''Rush has completely remade American politics by offering an alternative to the networks and CNN,'' Rove told me. ''For 20 years he has been the leader of his own parade.''
 Harrison offered an even more grandiose view: ''He's a phenomenon like the Beatles. Before Rush Limbaugh there was nothing like talk radio. He's been to talk what Elvis was to rock 'n' roll. He saved the AM dial.'' 
 ''ANTICIPATING A QUESTION,'' Limbaugh said when we pulled into the garage of his secluded beachfront mansion in Palm Beach, ''why do I have so many cars?''
 I hadn't actually been wondering that. Very rich people tend not to stint on transportation. For example, we drove to the house from the studio, Limbaugh at the wheel, in a black Maybach 57S, which runs around $450,000 fully loaded. He had half a dozen similar rides on his estate.
 ''I have these cars for two reasons,'' Limbaugh said. ''First, they are for the use of my guests. And two, I happen to love fine automobiles.''
 He also loves space. There are five homes -- all of them his -- on the property. The big house is 24,000 square feet. Limbaugh lives there with a cat. He's been married three times but has no children.
 Limbaugh informed me that I was the first journalist ever to enter his home. Mary Matalin, the Republican consultant, calls the place ''aspirational,'' which is one adjective that fits. The place, largely designed by Limbaugh himself, reflects the things and places he has seen and admired. The massive chandelier in the dining room, for example, is a replica of the one that hung in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel in New York. The gleaming cherry-wood floors are dotted with hand-woven oriental carpets. A life-size oil portrait of El Rushbo, as he often calls himself on the air, hangs on the wall of the main staircase.
 Unlike many right-wing talk-show hosts, Limbaugh does not view France with hostility. On the contrary, he is a Francophile. His salon, he told me, is meant to suggest Versailles. His main guest suite, which I did not personally inspect, was designed as an exact replica of the presidential suite of the George V Hotel in Paris. 
 Limbaugh is especially proud of his two-story library, which is a scaled-down version of the library at the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina. Cherubs dance on the ceiling, leatherbound collections line the bookshelves and the wood-paneled walls were once ''an acre of mahogany.''
 A fastidious man, Limbaugh has a keen eye for domestic detail. His staff lights fragrant candles throughout the house to greet his arrival from work each day. Limbaugh led me into his private humidor, selected two La Flor Dominicana Double Ligero Chisel stogies for us to smoke and seated me at an onyx-and-marble table in the study. The room opens onto a patio, a putting green and a beach. On the table was a brochure for Limbaugh's newest airplane, a Gulfstream G550. It cost him, he told me, $54 million.
 Limbaugh can afford to live the way he wants. When we met he was on the verge of signing a new eight-year contract with his syndicator, Premiere Radio Networks. He estimated that it would bring in about $38 million a year. To sweeten the deal, he said he was also getting a nine-figure signing bonus. (A representative from Premiere would not confirm the deal.) ''Do you know what bought me all this?'' he asked, waving his hand in the general direction of his prosperity. ''Not my political ideas. Conservatism didn't buy this house. First and foremost I'm a businessman. My first goal is to attract the largest possible audience so I can charge confiscatory ad rates. I happen to have great entertainment skills, but that enables me to sell airtime.''
 The average AM radio station reserves 18 to 20 minutes each hour for advertising, devotes about 5 minutes an hour to news and spends the rest of the time on other content. Limbaugh is not only paid by the stations, but his program also owns five minutes of every hour of airtime, which it can then sell to advertisers. 
 Some simply run their usual ads. Others use Limbaugh as their pitchman, which costs them a premium and a long-term commitment. And lately he has created a new option. At a much higher rate he will weave a product into his monologue (To a caller who said he took two showers after voting for Clinton in Operation Chaos, Limbaugh responded: ''If you had followed my advice and gotten a Rinnai tankless water heater, you wouldn't have needed to take two showers. And I'll tell you why. . . .'') 
 Limbaugh is being uncharacteristically modest when he attributes his wealth to simple salesmanship. First, you have to draw -- and keep -- a crowd. ''Rush is just an amazing radio performer,'' says Ira Glass, a star of the younger generation of public-radio personalities. ''Years ago, I used to listen in the car on my way to reporting gigs, and I'd notice that I disagreed with everything he was saying, yet I not only wanted to keep listening, I actually liked him. That is some chops. You can count on two hands the number of public figures in America who can pull that trick off.''
 Glass compares Limbaugh to another exceptional free-form radio monologist, Howard Stern. ''A lot of people dismiss them both as pandering and proselytizing and playing to the lowest common denominator, but I think that misses everything important about their shows,'' he says. ''They both think through their ideas in real time on the air, they both have a lot more warmth than they're generally given credit for, they both created an entire radio aesthetic.''
 LIMBAUGH STARTED LOSING HIS HEARING seven years ago, at the age of 50. Increasingly powerful hearing aids helped for a while, but eventually they stopped working. For almost two months he did his show without being able to hear a thing. Regular listeners began noticing that something was wrong. ''When I found myself going deaf, I didn't panic,'' he told me. ''I was diagnosed with auto-immune disease.'' (Limbaugh says he doesn't know what kind of auto-immune disorder it was.) ''Once I knew the problem, I looked for a practical solution,'' he continued. ''Eventually I flew out to California and had a cochlear implant. Luckily, it worked.'' Doctors, he told me, attribute this positive outcome to the relatively advanced age when he lost his hearing and the short time he was deaf.
 Limbaugh is known for his wicked impersonations of Bill Clinton, Ted Kennedy, John McCain and others. 
 ''How can you imitate anyone if you can't hear yourself?'' I asked him.
 He touched his throat. ''I know how the muscles are supposed to feel when I do the voices.''
 Limbaugh's voice is his instrument, and he has been honing it since he began his radio career as a high-school disc jockey. He still loves music, although he hears it most clearly in his memory. ''The last song I actually remember was probably a Luther Vandross tune,'' he told me. ''But if I put on oldies I know how they are supposed to sound.''
 He still uses a lot of rock 'n' roll in his broadcasts, introducing segments with Tina Turner's ''The Best'' or sampling an old Bo Diddley riff: ''Come on in closer baby, hear what else I got to say. You got your radio turned down too low. Turn it up!''
 We were on the way to Trevini, one of Limbaugh's favorite Palm Beach restaurants. Once again, Limbaugh was at the wheel. His girlfriend, Kathryn Rogers, a West Palm Beach events planner, rode shotgun. They met at a golf tournament last summer and have been an item since. 
 The Maybach was quiet enough for easy conversation, but the restaurant was a different story. We sat at a prime corner table, but the place was packed, and the decibel level caused him to frequently cup his hand to his ear, and sometimes miss entire sentences.
 Throughout dinner, people approached our table. Most were prosperous-looking Republican men of a certain age. ''God bless you,'' they told him, or, ''Keep up the fight.'' He smiled and thanked them in a good-natured way. One elderly gent in a blue blazer and gray slacks went into a long spiel about his good works on behalf of several conservative causes. Limbaugh nodded through the recitation, but when the man left he confided that he had not understood a word of it.
 Meanwhile, waiters buzzed around our table. They seemed to anticipate Limbaugh's every wish, refreshing our drinks, serving unasked-for delicacies, periodically checking to make sure everything was exactly to Limbaugh's satisfaction.
 Table talk focused on Limbaugh's house, or rather his concern over my reaction to it. That afternoon I wondered aloud what a single man with no kids could possibly want with a house that size. He frowned, obviously interpreting it as a hostile question, a Democrat question. Now he wanted to revisit the topic.
 ''When you saw my house today, you probably noticed that it isn't filled with pictures of me and famous people,'' he said. ''That's not me. I don't have a home that says, 'Look who I know!' ''
 ''No, you have a home that says, 'Look what I have.' ''
 ''Why would you say that?'' He sounded genuinely surprised, possibly even hurt.
 ''It might have something to do with that acre of mahogany you mentioned earlier.''
 ''My home is a place I feel comfortable in, a place for entertaining my friends and family,'' he said. 
 Later, his friend Roger Ailes, a frequent guest and the chairman of Fox News, put the Limbaugh lifestyle in perspective. ''He lives the way Jackie Gleason would have lived if Gleason had the money. Some people are irritated by it.''
 Dinner was winding down, and I called for the check. It tickled Limbaugh to be taken out to eat on The New York Times. A few weeks later, he sent me a copy of an interview with Jeremy Sullivan, a waiter at the Kobe KobeClub in New York. Sullivan told a reporter that Limbaugh, a fellow Missourian, was the biggest tipper in town: ''He likes to throw down the most massive tips I've ever seen. The last few times his tips have been $5,000.'' When I read this, I felt a stab of guilt toward the hyperattentive staff at Trevini. If I had only known, I would have let Limbaugh leave the tip.
 LIMBAUGH WAS A FAILURE almost as long as he has been a success. And although he is now an apostle of sunshine (''having more fun than a human being should be allowed to have,'' he crows on his show), he spent many years trying to convince his family -- and himself -- that he wasn't wasting his life.
 People sometimes wonder if Rush is a real name. It is, times three. He was born Rush Limbaugh III in 1951, in the Mississippi River town of Cape Girardeau, Mo. Cape Girardeau was Eisenhower America, Middle Western but far enough South that Limbaugh's younger brother David still speaks with a discernible twang. ''Rush got the voice in the family,'' he told me, unnecessarily.
 The Limbaughs were local gentry. Rush's grandfather, Rush Sr., was a venerated lawyer who practiced law past the age of 100. Uncle Steve Limbaugh is a federal judge, although he will soon step down as his son, Rush's cousin Steve, joins the federal bench. David Limbaugh, who still lives in Cape Girardeau, writes books and a syndicated political column, along with handling his brother's legal work. 
 Limbaugh's father, Rush Jr., was a lawyer, too, a prominent local Republican activist and the most influential figure in his sons' lives. He served as a pilot in World War II and became vehemently anti-Communist and very much committed to the ideas and ideals of small-town Protestant America. Limbaugh remembers his father playing host to Vice President Richard Nixon in Cape Girardeau in the 1956 election. To this day, Limbaugh calls his father ''the smartest man I've ever met.''
 Certainly he was one of the most opinionated and autocratic. ''On Friday nights my friends would come over to the house just to listen to my dad rant about politics,'' Limbaugh recalls. ''He was doing the same thing as I do today, without the humor or the satire. He didn't approve of making fun of presidents. He didn't think that sort of thing was funny.''
 Dick Adams, Rush's boyhood friend and high-school debate partner, told me: ''Mr. Limbaugh didn't suffer fools lightly, let's just put it like that. Many times I was over there when he called down Rush or David in harsh tones. There was usually a string of expletives attached.''
 Father-son arguments weren't political. Rush seems to have swallowed his father's monologues whole. Like the great black singers of his generation, Limbaugh took the familiar pieties and ambient sounds of his time and place and used them to create a genre of entertainment, full of humor, passion and commercial possibility. There are many ways to look at Rush Limbaugh III: one is that he is the first white, Goldwater Republican soul shouter.
 But first he had to get out of town.
 ''My father expected me to be a professional man,'' Limbaugh told me. ''The problem was, I hated school. I hated being told what to do. In the Boy Scouts I never got a single merit badge. In school my grades were terrible. I just didn't want to be there. I just wanted to be on the radio.''
 Rush's father hoped the boy would grow out of this ambition. But to appease him, he lent 16-year-old Rush the money for a summer course in radio engineering in Dallas. Limbaugh returned with a broadcaster's license, which he parlayed into a job at the local radio station. Soon he had his own show. Being on the radio made him a local celebrity, and he never lost the taste for it.
 Limbaugh was miserable when his father insisted he attend college. Under protest he enrolled at nearby Southeast Missouri State University, where he lasted a year. Somehow he even contrived to flunk speech.
 ''My mother used to drive me there and pick me up, just to make sure I'd go,'' he told me. ''But it didn't do any good. First chance I got, I was out of there.'' 
 Limbaugh hit the road in a 1969 Pontiac LeMans. He spent the 1970s spinning records at radio stations around the country under the name Jeff Christie. From the start, he had a knack for making people laugh. In Pittsburgh he sometimes convinced callers he could see them via a special telephone. He did voices and parodies. 
 Limbaugh drifted from job to job. He was wounded by his father's disapproval, unable to make a real go of the radio business and unlucky in marriage. In the mid-'80s he took a job in the front office of the Kansas City Royals baseball team. He was making $12,000 a year, and he almost quit to take a more lucrative job as a potato-chip distributor. ''They were offering $35,000,'' he told me. ''That sounded like a lot of money.''
 Instead, he decided to take a last gamble on his talent. He found a radio job in Sacramento where, for the first time, he started airing his conservative opinions and really developing his bombastic, politically incorrect, El Rushbo persona. The show was a hit.
 ''In those days the mainstream liberals had a media monopoly,'' he says. ''All three TV networks, CNN, Time and Newsweek, and the newspapers. AM radio was considered a dying venue. Nobody did political talk, let alone conservative political talk.'' 
 Limbaugh said things that people had never heard on the radio. He mocked the women's movement (''feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women access to the mainstream of society''); scoffed at sex education (''condoms work only during the school year''); and took on conventional wisdom (''using federal dollars as a measure, our cities have not been neglected but poisoned with welfare-dependency funds''). It is hard to imagine, so many years later, how strange and rebellious, how simply wrong, such sentiments sounded.
 In 1988, Limbaugh moved to New York and took his show national. He came to the city with the usual make-it-there, make-it-anywhere expectations. The show, carried locally on WABC-AM, was a national hit. But socially, he flopped.
 ''I assumed there was a fraternity of broadcasting guys in New York,'' he told me. ''I thought my success would launch me into a circle of accomplished people. Look, I admired these people. Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather -- people watched these guys. I thought they would welcome me as one of them. I was wrong.'' Eventually Limbaugh came to a rather obvious conclusion. ''I realized that my professional achievements were discounted because of my conservatism and my constant criticism of those who I thought would welcome me.''
 Why on earth did he expect people he was mocking on the air to embrace him, I asked.
 ''Immaturity,'' he said. ''I was shocked by the visceral hatred. Nobody hated me growing up. Nobody hated me in Kansas City. Even in Sacramento, which is a liberal town, nobody hated me. That didn't happen until I got to Manhattan.''
 Not everyone in the big city gave Limbaugh the cold shoulder. William F. Buckley Jr., the publisher of The National Review, saw the young broadcaster's star power and took Limbaugh into his orbit. Limbaugh was honored by the attention.
 ''I grew up on National Review and Mr. Buckley,'' Limbaugh told me. ''Aside from my father, he's the most influential man in my life.'' In Buckley's circle he was an incongruous figure -- provincial, self-educated and full of declasse rock-and-roll enthusiasm. But Buckley took Limbaugh seriously, cultivated him, promoted him and saw to it that he connected with the right people. 
 Buckley died a few days after my first visit to Limbaugh in Florida. Limbaugh mourned him on the air and off. But he also had a sense that, with Buckley's passing, he now became the movement's elder statesman. Jay Nordlinger, a senior editor at The National Review, watched Limbaugh's tutelage under Buckley, and he takes Limbaugh seriously as a polemicist and public intellectual. ''I hired a lot of people over the years, fancy kids from elite schools, and I always asked, 'How did you become a conservative?' Many of them said, 'Listening to Rush Limbaugh.' And often they'd add, 'Behind my parents' back.' ''
 Limbaugh's audience is often underestimated by critics who don't listen to the show (only 3 percent of his audience identify themselves as ''liberal,'' according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center for the People and the Press). Recently, Pew reported that, on a series of ''news knowledge questions,'' Limbaugh's ''Dittoheads'' -- the defiantly self-mocking term for his faithful, supposedly brainwashed, audience -- scored higher than NPR listeners. The study found that ''readers of newsmagazines, political magazines and business magazines, listeners of Rush Limbaugh and NPR and viewers of the Daily Show and C-SPAN are also much more likely than the average person to have a college degree.''
 For his part, Limbaugh sees himself as a thinker as well as showman. ''I take the responsibility that comes with my show very seriously,'' he told me. ''I want to persuade people with ideas. I don't walk around thinking about my power. But in my heart and soul, I know I have become the intellectual engine of the conservative movement.'' 
 In truth, Limbaugh is less a theoretician than a popularizer of what he regards as the correct conservative responses to contemporary issues. Most of his concerns are economic. ''I consider myself a defender of corporate America,'' he told me. Limbaugh is admired by the religious right, but he is far from pious on matters of adult behavior. He is also one of the few commentators -- left or right -- who never speaks cloyingly about America's obligation to its children and grandchildren.
 Recently, I sent Limbaugh an e-mail message, his preferred means of long-distance communication, asking what his own presidential agenda would look like. His answer reflects his actual concerns. A Limbaugh administration would seek to:
 1. Open the continental shelf to drilling. Ditto the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
 2. Establish a 17 percent flat tax.
 3. Privatize Social Security.
 4. Give parents school vouchers to break the monopoly of public education.
 5. Revoke Jimmy Carter's passport while he is out of the country.
 6. Abandon all government policies based on the hoax of man-made global warming.
 No. 5 was a joke. I think.
 EVERY APRIL, LIMBAUGH HOSTS A WEEKEND at his Palm Beach estate for his closest friends. This year the guest list included Roger Ailes, Mary Matalin and Joel Surnow, a creator of the television series ''24'' and a leader of the small Hollywood conservative community. The event is social but hardly nonpolitical. 
 Anyone looking for an informal gathering of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy could do worse than this. Limbaugh is also close to Karl Rove, who dined with him a few weeks earlier in Florida; Justice Antonin Scalia (last year he attended a dinner at cousin Steve Limbaugh's Cape Girardeau home); and Justice Clarence Thomas (who officiated at Limbaugh's third wedding). He describes his fellow Floridian Matt Drudge as a buddy. George H. W. Bush invited Limbaugh to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom.
 More recently, Dick Cheney toasted Limbaugh at a dinner party; a copy of the vice president's remarks hangs on Limbaugh's wall at home. But Limbaugh's real hero and constant role model is Ronald Reagan.
 Limbaugh admires many aspects of Reaganism, but he is especially animated by his belief in American exceptionalism. ''Reagan rejected the notion among liberals and conservatives alike who, for different reasons, believed America was in a permanent state of decline,'' he wrote to me in an e-mail message. ''He had faith in the wisdom of the American people. . . . He knew America wasn't perfect, but he also knew it was the most perfect of nations. Reagan was an advocate of Americanism.'' In response to a separate question, he wrote: ''America is the solution to the world's problems. We are not the problem.''
 Limbaugh said he believes that President George W. Bush is well meaning but far from the Reagan standard of excellence. ''I like President Bush,'' he wrote me, ''but he is not a conservative. He is conservative on some things, but he has not led a movement as Reagan did every day of his career. Bush's unpopularity is due primarily to his reluctance to publicly defend himself and his administration against attacks from the left. . . . The country has not tilted to the left in my view. What has been absent is elected conservative leadership from the White House down to the Congress.''
 Needless to say, Limbaugh doesn't see John McCain as the answer to this problem, and it infuriates him when McCain claims to be a Reaganite. ''McCain and Reagan do not belong in the same sentence,'' he wrote. 
 Of course, his problems with McCain won't prevent Limbaugh from trying to defeat Obama or from trying to push McCain toward his views. Some think he is already succeeding in the latter mission. Mary Matalin, who has a great belief in Limbaugh's powers of persuasion with the public, said: ''Why do you think McCain changed on the immigration issue? Because of his advisers?''
 Karl Rove says he thinks Limbaugh's greatest influence in this election cycle will be as a backbone-stiffening agent: ''He's a leader,'' Rove said. ''If Rush engages on an issue, it gives others courage to engage.''
 It is a tough job this year, and Limbaugh said he knows it. Despite his insistence that Obama is just another liberal, attacking and ridiculing him will be delicate work. ''There is nothing worse than being branded a racist,'' he told me at the end of our last meeting in Florida. ''That's what Bill Clinton tried to do to me.'' 
 At the first White House correspondents' dinner of the Clinton administration, the president cracked that Limbaugh had stood up for Attorney General Janet Reno, but he ''only did it because she was attacked by a black guy.'' (The ''black guy'' being Representative John Conyers.) 
 Limbaugh was in the audience, and he was livid. He demanded, and received, a White House apology. It was reminiscent of the time F.D.R. went after the legendary H. L. Mencken at a Gridiron Club dinner in 1934. Limbaugh took it as a warning. ''If they successfully tar you as a racist, you are David Duke,'' Limbaugh told me.
 On May 16, Limbaugh delivered a monologue on what you can't say about Obama: ''With Obama we started out, we couldn't talk about his big ears 'cause that made him nervous. We've gone from that to this: Not only can we not mention his ears, we can't talk about his mother. We can't talk about his father. We can't talk about his grandmother unless he does, brings her up as a 'typical white person.' We can't talk about his wife, can't talk about his preacher, can't talk about his terrorist friends, can't talk about his voting record, can't talk about his religion. We can't talk about appeasement. We can't talk about color; we can't talk about lack of color. We can't talk about race. We can't talk about bombers and mobsters who are his friends. We can't talk about schooling. We can't talk about his name, 'Hussein.' We can't talk about his lack of experience. Can't talk about his income. Can't talk about his flag pin. This started out we can't call him a liberal. It started out we just couldn't talk about his ears. Now we can't say anything about him.''
 So far Limbaugh's tactic has been to frame his attacks on Obama in the words of liberals themselves. Among the musical parodies, which he writes with the comedian Paul Shanklin, in his arsenal is ''Barack the Magic Negro,'' sung to the tune of ''Puff the Magic Dragon,'' by a dead-on Al Sharpton impersonator. The song was met by indignation when he first played it in March -- until Limbaugh revealed that the title and the idea of Obama as a redemptive black man a la Sidney Poitier -- came from an op-ed piece written by a black commentator, David Ehrenstein, in The Los Angeles Times. 
 Sharpton is too much a master of such signification to miss the art in Limbaugh's boomerang trick. ''I despise his ideology,'' Sharpton told me, ''but Rush is a lot smarter and craftier than Don Imus. Limbaugh puts things in a way that he can't be blamed for easy bigotry. Some of the songs he does about me just make me laugh. But he's the most dangerous guy we have to deal with on the right, including O'Reilly and Imus. They come at you with an ax. He uses a razor.'' 
 THE ATMOSPHERE in the studio on the morning after our dinner at Trevini was relaxed, even festive. When I arrived around 11, Limbaugh was at his computer, wearing shorts and doing prep.
 Augusto, his personal chef, was there, preparing lunch, signaling an occasion. Limbaugh skipped the meal, explaining that he doesn't eat close to show time for reasons of ''burp prevention.'' Snerdly, Dawn and the engineer joined me in the dining room, which looks as if it were decorated by Nancy Reagan's fussy aunt.
 Limbaugh's program that day was, as usual, a virtuoso performance. He took a few calls, but mostly he delivered a series of monologues on political and cultural topics. Limbaugh works extemporaneously. He has no writers or script, just notes and a producer on the line from New York with occasional bits of information. That day, and every day, he produced 10,000 words of fluent, often clever political talk.
 There was nothing he said that was startling -- he spent parts of the show mocking Obama's ''change'' mantra and excoriating those who believe in global warming and talking about foreign affairs. But if you think it is easy turning ancient Greenland, the influence of the teachers' unions or changes in E.U. foreign policy into polemical comedy that will hold an audience for three hours -- try it for 15 minutes at your next cocktail party.
 Limbaugh entertains, but he also instructs. He provides his listeners with news and views they can use, and he teaches them how to employ it. ''Rush is an intellectual-force multiplier,'' Rove told me. ''His listeners are, themselves, communicators.'' 
 After the show, Limbaugh and I sat in the studio for several hours talking. He was in an expansive mood, and he didn't duck when I asked him about the most infamous chapter of his career, his drug bust. In 2006, after years of addiction to painkillers, Limbaugh was charged in Florida with ''doctor shopping'' prescriptions. He pleaded not guilty and cut a deal; the charges would be dismissed after 18 months if he continued rehabilitation and treatment with a therapist. 
 Needless to say, the case became a national scandal. His enemies jeered that the white knight of American conservatism was a junkie. His fans feared the scandal might end his career. Some prayed for him. Limbaugh's lawyer, Roy Black, hired a Florida psychologist, Steve Strumwasser, to evaluate his client.
 ''I assessed Rush, and I saw he had a problem he couldn't control,'' Strumwasser told me in a phone interview authorized by Limbaugh. ''I knew his name and what he did for a living, but that's about it.''
 Strumwasser recommended that Limbaugh check into the Meadows, in Wickenburg, Ariz., a rehab center that specializes in celebrities.
 ''They guarded his privacy, but other than that, he was treated like everybody else,'' said Strumwasser, who traveled with him to Arizona and checked him in. ''Rush did individual therapy, took part in group sessions and got along with everybody.''
 According to Strumwasser, Limbaugh had previously tried twice to stop using drugs on his own and failed. ''It takes most people a lot of time to assume personal responsibility for an addiction,'' he said. ''Especially in a case like this, where there is a professional risk involved. But by the time I met him, Rush wasn't denying his problem at all. He went about getting better in a very passionate way.''
 The passion was muted when Limbaugh returned to the air, after six weeks. He candidly but drily, discussed his addiction and legal status, told his listeners that he was not a victim and then went on with the broadcast.
 In the studio the day we spoke, Limbaugh was more emotional. ''I thank God for my addiction,'' he told me. ''It made me understand my shortcomings.'' 
 Being Limbaugh, he said he believes that most of these shortcomings stemmed from his inability to love himself sufficiently. ''I felt everyone who criticized me was right and I was wrong,'' he confided. But, he says, he left his insecurities behind in Arizona. ''It's not possible to offend me now,'' he said. ''I won't give people the power to do it anymore. My problem was born of immaturity and my childhood desire for acceptance. I learned in drug rehab that this was stunting and unrealistic. I was seeking acceptance from the wrong people.''
 Limbaugh told me he is no longer concerned about the opinions of his colleagues and rivals, and he makes no effort to disguise his contempt for most of them. Michael Savage, ranked No. 3 among talk-radio hosts by Talkers magazine? ''He's not even in my rearview mirror.'' Garrison Keillor? ''I don't even know where to find NPR on the dial.'' 
 At dinner the night before, Bill O'Reilly's name came up, and Limbaugh expressed his opinion of the Fox cable king. He hadn't been sure at the time that he wanted it on the record. But on second thought, ''somebody's got to say it,'' he told me. ''The man is Ted Baxter.''
 Limbaugh does have his favorites. He admires Ann Coulter's ability to outrage liberals. He is a fan of the columnists Camille Paglia and Thomas Sowell, both of whom he considers honest thinkers. And he is especially impressed by the essays of Christopher Hitchens. ''He's misguided sometimes, but when you read him, you finish the whole article.''
 Limbaugh has a deeply conflicted attitude toward Sean Hannity, his one-time stand in and now perpetual No. 2 on the Talkers list. He speaks of the younger man with the same condescending affection that Muhammad Ali once showed Jimmy Ellis, a former sparring partner turned challenger. But he wanted me to remember who is the Greatest. ''I have no competitors,'' he said. ''Hannity isn't even close to me.''
 Hannity became a touchy issue in the late spring. For more than a year he was on what appeared to be a quixotic campaign to raise the issue of Obama's controversial pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Then the story exploded. Not only that, Hannity also led the pack on Obama's connection to the former Weatherman leader William Ayers. Operation Chaos was still garnering attention and amusing listeners, but the election news was being made elsewhere.
 From New York, I sent Limbaugh a teasing e-mail message: ''Hannity has been first and hardest on the Reverend Wright controversy and the Bill Ayers thing. Is it possible that he is running a separate Operation Chaos with superior intel?''
 Limbaugh didn't dispute that Hannity was first on the Wright and Ayers controversies. But, he wrote: ''Things only take off when I mention them. That is the point.''
 Two weeks later, The Daily Telegraph in London published a list of America's most-influential pundits. Limbaugh finished fourth, behind Hannity. Once again I wrote a message to Limbaugh: ''Are we looking at a changing of the guard on the right side of the dial?''
 Limbaugh scoffed. ''Since when have I cared what the media says?'' he wrote. ''Media polls are not the measure. Ratings 'polls' and revenue are. And it still ain't close.''
 I couldn't resist. ''I wasn't asking about the media,'' I wrote him. ''I was asking about Hannity. Hannity can fairly take credit (as he does now, every night) for being more influential than any other commentator in changing the course of this election. That strikes me as new. Or am I wrong?''
 At which point Limbaugh, who patiently and graciously answered dozens of my questions, allowed me to invade his bunker and his castle, shared hours of his time, permitted me access to his closest family and most-intimate friends, even his therapist, had enough. ''Write what you want,'' he snapped across cyberspace. 
 AS A BOY, Rush Limbaugh always preferred the company of adults, and it seems to me he doesn't consider liberals to be real grown-ups. ''They are destructive of the institutions and traditions that make this country great,'' he says. ''I want to reduce them to a small group. I want no more than 10 to 15 of them in Congress.''
 Limbaugh has no illusions that this will be the result of the 2008 election. ''Real conservatism wins every time it's tried,'' he told me. ''But the party has abandoned conservatives as a base. McCain doesn't want to criticize Democrats; he wants Democrats to vote for him.''
 The oddity is that Limbaugh himself makes this strategy possible. Why, after all, should John McCain take the low road, antagonize independents and become embroiled in racial controversy when he can count on Limbaugh to become the G.O.P.'s most-effective unofficial Obama Criticizer?
 If McCain wins, Limbaugh will spend the next four years tugging him to the right. If he loses, it will not be, in Limbaugh's estimation, Limbaugh's fault, and it won't be the end of his world either. A secret of Limbaugh's success is that his uncompromising, often harsh ideas are offset by a basically friendly temperament. He is less like his angry father than his mature role models, Buckley and Reagan, for whom sociability and fun were integral to their conservative world view. 
 And increasingly, he has other interests. He's been spending more time with his extended family in Cape Girardeau, where he's so popular that the municipality runs a Rush Limbaugh tour for visitors. He toys with the idea of buying an N.F.L. franchise. His friend Joel Surnow says that if there were a Rush Limbaugh movie, it would be something along the lines of ''Citizen Kane'' meets Howard Stern. 
 As for politics, Rush has already picked his candidate for the Conservative Restoration: Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a 37-year-old prodigy whom Limbaugh considers to be a genuine movement conservative in the Ronald Reagan mold -- ''fresh, energetic and optimistic in his view of America.'' In the meantime, though, there's the Democratic convention in Denver to muck around in, and then the main event in November. Operation Chaos is over, but Rush will come up with something new to delight his fans and infuriate his foes. Presidents rise and presidents fall, but ''The Rush Limbaugh Show'' will go on, weekdays at 12:06, Eastern Time.

HEADLINE: Jill Rackmill, Daniel Arnall

 BODY:
Jill Tracy Rackmill and Daniel Eugene Arnall were married on Friday evening at the Garrison, a resort in Garrison, N.Y. The Rev. Erik Kolbell, a minister of the United Church of Christ, officiated with Cantor Daniel Rous taking part. 
 The couple met at ABC News in Manhattan. He is an editor who also reports on business and the economy for the network. She is currently on a leave from ABC, but had been working as a producer there. 
 Ms. Rackmill, 36, is keeping her name. She graduated from Cornell. 
 She is a daughter of Linda and Stephen J. Rackmill of Westerleigh, Staten Island. Her father, who is retired, worked in Brooklyn as the chief probation officer for the Federal Court System, Eastern District of New York. He also retired as an adjunct professor of criminal justice at John Jay College and at the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University. Her mother retired as a teacher's aide at Public School 4 in Arden Heights, Staten Island. 
 Mr. Arnall, 34, graduated from the University of Missouri and received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia. 
 He is a son of Linda and Gary Arnall of Springfield, Mo. His mother retired as a mathematics teacher at Logan-Rogersville Middle School in Rogersville, Mo. His father is a regional sales director, in Springfield, for GuideOne Insurance of Des Moines.
 The couple met in December 2004 at an ABC News holiday party in Manhattan. They felt an immediate connection, but Mr. Arnall was hesitant. ''It had always been a rule of mine to not mix romance with a workplace relationship,'' he said.
 But the following July, Mr. Arnall and Ms. Rackmill met by chance on the subway, and he seized the moment by inviting her to dinner.
 ''Despite my rule, I felt a possible relationship with Jill was a risk well worth taking,'' Mr. Arnall explained.
 Several hours after their first date, both Mr. Arnall and Ms. Rackmill received calls from ABC telling them of the terrorist bombings in London. He was summoned to the office to write about how the bombings were affecting financial markets around the world, and she was sent to Leeds, in northern England, where three of the four suicide bombers had lived.
 ''When I got there I spent two weeks researching the backgrounds of the bombers, and as I worked, I was getting e-mails from Dan telling me about the background of the city, and some of the fun things there were to do in Leeds,'' Ms. Rackmill said of Mr. Arnall's cheery missives. ''Wherever I went, I kept thinking about him.''

HEADLINE: You Had a Friend in Albany

BYLINE: By MITCHELL L. MOSS. 
Mitchell L. Moss is a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University's Wagner School of Public Service.

 BODY:
LAST month, Joseph Bruno, the upstate Republican who was the New York State Senate majority leader for more than a decade, announced he was retiring amid speculation concerning a federal investigation of his outside business activities. Democrats in New York City were thrilled by the news -- but they are about to find out that Mr. Bruno was their best friend in Albany, and life without him won't be easy. 
 While New York City is the economic and cultural center of the Empire State, upstate and suburban legislators wield enormous control over the city's ability to govern itself. That's the result of a State Constitution drafted more than 100 years ago, when upstate Yankees didn't trust the immigrants flowing into Manhattan and required the city's officials to seek approval from Albany for essential responsibilities of municipal government. 
 But Mr. Bruno, although he hails from a rural district that includes Rensselaer and most of Saratoga Counties, also realized that the state could not survive without a strong and safe New York City, which accounts for more than half of the state's personal income tax revenue despite being home to just 40 percent of the state's population. As a result, he played a critical role in mobilizing recalcitrant Republican colleagues, including former Gov. George Pataki, to help city leaders.
 When Michael Bloomberg was first elected mayor in 2001, the city faced a serious fiscal crisis and a projected municipal deficit of $6 billion. Raising taxes was initially impossible in the post-Sept. 11 environment, when there was considerable doubt about the economic survival of the city. In 2003, the mayor, with the support of City Council, raised property taxes and also sought approval from Albany for increased city income taxes and a state takeover of $2.5 billion in long-term debt issued during the 1970s fiscal crisis. The takeover of the debt, which had been guaranteed by the city sales tax, freed up $500 million a year for vital public services. Without Mr. Bruno, it's unlikely that Republican state senators would have agreed with the Democratic-controlled State Assembly to aid the city.
 More recently, when the city sought to start a $13 billion school construction program, Mr. Bruno convinced his fellow Republicans to have the state split the cost 50-50. As a result, the state is paying the debt service for $6.5 billion earmarked for renovating and constructing schools.
 Since 2001, the homicide rate in New York City has gone down by almost 18 percent and rapes by more than 25 percent. Under the Bloomberg administration, the New York Police Department has put a new emphasis on getting illegal handguns off the streets. But it was Mr. Bruno who led the effort to impose the toughest penalties in the nation for those who carry a loaded illegal handgun. And, working closely with Mr. Bruno, Mayor Bloomberg overcame the Democratic Assembly's traditional resistance to expanding the use of the state DNA databank, so that it now covers all felonies and many misdemeanors. 
 Senator Bruno understood how to balance the values of upstate communities with the forces of growth that are shaping New York City and its suburbs. He recognized the need for compromise, for making deals and for striking bargains between opposing interests. And while he always took care of his local constituents, he knew enough to take care of New York City as well.
 His departure from Albany is being treated as the end of an era, leading perhaps to the end of more than 40 years of Republican control of the State Senate. City Democrats may think that's great news, but they should be wary of the future.

 RIGHTS OFFICIAL'S TENURE
 Brings Praise and Anger
 As she steps down after four years as the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Louise Arbour sounds heartened by the progress she saw, progress that some human rights groups say Ms. Arbour can share credit for. But her forthright views have also angered many, and some supporters of Israel have called her an idiot. PAGE 13
 POLICE KILL INMATES
 Syrian military police officers fired on Islamist inmates during a riot at a prison outside Damascus, the capital, leaving at least nine inmates dead, human rights officials said. Inmates were holding hostage a group of military police and prison personnel, the officials said. The dispute is said to have begun over a security sweep by the military police. PAGE 8 
 A DEFIANT IRAN
 Iran's nuclear policy has not changed, an Iranian government spokesman said, confirming that Iran will not comply with Security Council resolutions requiring it to stop enriching uranium. The remarks came a day after a formal Iranian response to a proposal of incentives intended to resolve the impasse over the country's nuclear program that did not address its enrichment activities.

 OBAMA LEARNS A FRIEND
 Can Also Be a Foe
 Thanks to a fellow whose previous targets have included the likes of Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, Senator Barack Obama is learning how a force that he has been using to his benefit -- the power of social networking -- can also turn back on a candidate (even when wielded by a supporter). PAGE 18
 BLOOD SPORT ENDURES
 New Mexico, which last year became the 49th state to make cockfighting illegal, has devoted vast resources to ending the sport, but with limited success. Light penalties not only have failed to stop the fights, but also continue to attract cockfighters from neighboring states where the sport is a felony. ''They ain't shut nothing down,'' said one rooster breeder. PAGE 14

 The people of Madison Square Garden Entertainment fell in love with a 900-acre dairy farm in Springfield, N.Y., while looking for a site on which to hold what they hope to make ''an annual world-class, three-day music festival.''

HIGH WIRE 
 The Precarious Financial Lives of American Families. 
 By Peter Gosselin. 
 374 pp. Basic Books. $26.95. 
 One of the most memorable lines from George W. Bush's convention speech in September 2004 introduced the concept of an ''ownership society.'' ''Ownership brings security, and dignity and independence,'' the president declared. 
 The line was memorable not just for its soothing cadences, but because it arguably marked the high point of the Bush era. Within six months, Bush would win re-election and unveil the centerpiece of his ownership agenda, Social Security privatization. Six months after that, not only was Social Security privatization dead: its staggering unpopularity had weighed down the entire administration. 
 Peter Gosselin probably didn't set out to explain the collapse of the Bush economic agenda in ''High Wire: The Precarious Financial Lives of American Families.'' But his trenchant book could easily be read that way. An economics reporter with The Los Angeles Times, Gosselin demonstrates that Bush's ownership agenda completely misread the economic zeitgeist. Americans have seen their financial situations grow far less stable over the last few decades, he reports. Against this backdrop, the prospect of assuming still more risk, as Bush proposed, gave many of them agita. 
 Scouring the data, Gosselin finds that the income of a middle-class family in the early 1970s typically rose or fell by no more than 17 percent in a given year; today, that range is plus or minus 26 percent. And it's not just the middle class who've seen their incomes fluctuate wildly. The most affluent tenth of the country saw a slightly greater rise in volatility.
 The cause of this increased turbulence, Gosselin says, is a changing labor market and a decades-long erosion of the corporate and social safety net. A generation ago, when unemployment relief was more generous, when companies provided liberal health and pension benefits and private insurers weren't as stingy as they are today, a serious illness or the loss of a job usually wasn't devastating. Now, such a setback is much more likely to bring economic ruin. 
 Gosselin's argument isn't entirely new. In recent years, academics like the Yale political scientist Jacob S. Hacker and the Harvard-trained sociologist Elisabeth Jacobs have devoted countless megahertz of computing power to documenting these trends (both are mentioned in the book). Though his treatment of the numbers is rigorous and lucid, Gosselin adds more value with his hair-raising stories of arbitrary job loss and evaporating retirement funds. 
 Gosselin has an eye for spotting leaks in places you thought were treated with risk-resistant shellac. That health coverage you think you have? As Rebecca Rowlands learned during her fight with ovarian cancer, the insurer can withdraw it upon discovering the most innocent error in your paperwork. That homeowners policy you're currently on? As the Tunnell family learned after losing their house in a wildfire, the insurer can unilaterally gut your coverage with a single opaquely worded notice. 
 One of the book's few limitations is that Gosselin's characters can seem like abstractions. We learn enough to understand their problems, but not enough to feel real empathy. Such is not the case in a chapter called ''Unjobs,'' however, where we meet a former Arthur Andersen executive named Bruce Meyer. 
 Meyer is part of a growing army of economic zombies who look to the untrained eye like successes but who lost their livelihoods years ago and have yet to fully replace them. Meyer still occupies a spacious home in a tony Atlanta suburb, with a BMW and a Jeep Cherokee out front. He meets with business associates and even does high-profile charity work. But he hasn't held a steady job for more than five years. The only things that sustain him are the odd consulting gig and years of savings. In the best passage of the book, Gosselin describes Meyer's membership in the Kettering Group, a networking organization for down-on-their-luck executives. That there would be enough Bruce Meyers to form a club, and enough Kettering Groups to spawn a ''nationwide phenomenon,'' is a gruesome reminder of how few of us are insulated from the current insecurity. 
 The only thing missing from ''High Wire'' is a satisfying account of the rise in risk -- the causes as opposed to the consequences. Gosselin often lays the blame at the feet of greedy executives, who, he says, have abdicated their responsibilities to workers -- and in the case of insurers, to customers. He tends to anthropomorphize corporations, as when he writes that ''employers have become less interested in maintaining career-long ties to their workers.''
 There is no doubt that some corporations refuse to show loyalty and pay generous benefits even though they could. Likewise, insurance companies are increasingly skilled at skimming off the safest bets and denying coverage to the rest. 
 But to attribute the long-term rise in risk primarily to corporate malevolence misses the point. The years following World War II, which Gosselin posits as a model of corporate responsibility, were a historical anomaly: American companies faced little competition from war-flattened Europe and Asia. They could buy labor peace with rising wages and benefits. But with the resurgence of Japan and Western Europe in the 1960s and '70s, American profit margins declined and workers got squeezed. Later on, the ease with which companies could tap foreign labor (along with pressure from Wall Street to show steady profit growth) further frayed the labor-management relationship.
 These trends are of more than just academic interest. Easing the anxieties Gosselin describes requires understanding the forces that produced them. If greed and malevolence are the chief culprits, then aggressive regulation should suffice. But if the changes are structural and irreversible, we may have to rethink the role of government in the economy. Something akin to the Danish model might make sense. The Danes have one of the most business-friendly economies in the world -- corporations can hire and fire with relative ease, taxes on profits and investment are low -- but also one of the most generous welfare states. Perhaps not surprisingly, while Gosselin does offer a few sound policy recommendations, his discussion here is brief and somewhat scattershot. 
 Still, this is basically a quibble. In November, voters will face a choice between a Democrat who talks about alleviating the risks bearing down on lower- and middle-income Americans and a Republican who, in effect, promises to continue the Bush administration's economic policies. Voters confused about how this choice affects their daily lives should read Gosselin's book from cover to cover.

HEADLINE: Untying A Knot in Campaign Finance

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University. E-mail: rhfrank@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHEN Barack Obama announced his decision to reject public financing for his presidential campaign, he caught heavy flak from all sides. Critics, including some of his most ardent supporters, complained that he was willing to abandon the cause of good government to gain a financial edge.
 What the critics have ignored is that truly effective campaign finance reform has been precluded by First Amendment concerns. Given that constraint, the Obama campaign's approach may offer the only realistic possibility of limiting the corrupting influence of money in politics. 
 Many champions of good government say they favor public financing because campaign spending is wasteful. It's a fair point. After all, campaign spending is driven by the same logic that governs a military arms race. But while the competition to amass bigger and more powerful weapons generates waste on a truly grand scale, the waste from campaign spending is relatively trivial -- at most, a small fraction of 1 percent of national income. The spending itself is not the problem. The far more compelling rationale for campaign finance reform is to prevent the conflicts of interest that produce bad laws and policies. 
 Even in the face of current campaign finance legislation, politicians clearly remain subject to such conflicts. Scores of members of Congress, for example, accepted contributions from the same pharmaceutical companies that reaped millions of dollars of additional profit from the provision in Medicare Part D legislation that prevented the government from negotiating discount prescription prices for beneficiaries. 
 Most of these legislators would deny any conflict, saying the provision they supported had somehow served the public interest. That's not surprising -- few of us like to acknowledge our own possible vulnerability to conflicts of interest. But we are quick to recognize that others are subject to them, which explains the perennial attraction of legislation to limit the role of money in politics. 
 In legislative matters, however, the devil is in the details. Both the Federal Election Campaign Act (amended in the aftermath of Watergate in 1974) and the more recent Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (popularly known as McCain-Feingold) have faced numerous First Amendment challenges, and more are pending. Although the Supreme Court has affirmed the legality of placing contribution and expenditure limits on candidates who accept public financing, it has ruled against imposing similar limits on independent advocacy groups. 
 Because political expression occupies such a hallowed place in the American constitutional tradition, the court's First Amendment concerns won't vanish. Voicing one's opinions effectively in a political campaign requires money. So the law can't eliminate the influence of money in politics without also preventing people from making their political views heard. 
 At the same time, it is vitally important to prevent donors from buying laws and policies in violation of the public trust. 
 The harsh reality is that free speech and good government are conflicting goals. When forced to choose, the Supreme Court has essentially sided with free speech. Recent decisions by the Roberts court suggest an even stronger tilt in that direction.
 That is the crucial backdrop to the 2008 campaign. Despite the McCain-Feingold law, the First Amendment constraint had essentially made it impossible to impose effective legal limits on campaign spending. As the year unfolded, however, the Obama campaign demonstrated the possibility not only of remaining financially competitive but also of raising record sums by relying primarily on small donations from individuals. (Disclosure: I'm one of those contributors.) 
 This was a significant change. It showed that voters had the power to take matters into their own hands. For them to be able to avoid candidates who are beholden to large contributors, the law need only require full public disclosure of campaign contributions, a step that poses no threat to the First Amendment.
 Senator Obama's fund-raising totals caught many observers off guard. After all, traditional economic models suggest that a campaign financed by small individual donations shouldn't go far. The problem, according to these models, is that because a campaign's fate is essentially independent of any given small donation, no individual donor can expect to have any influence. Yet many small donors seem undeterred by that logic.
 Campaign finance reform laws notwithstanding, political campaign contributions from large donors have grown explosively in recent decades. Because the marketplace has become so much more competitive, corporations are under much greater pressure to bend the rules to their own advantage. In this effort, the corporate side has had victories like Medicare Part D, the so-called Enron loophole and the deregulation of the financial industry. But the public has often paid a heavy price.
 To be sure, the Obama campaign's move does nothing to reduce the scale of campaign budgets. Nor does the mere fact that small donors can finance successful campaigns guarantee that champions of good government will prevail. A charismatic tyrant, for example, might prove extremely successful as a fund-raiser. Current campaign finance laws, which allow but do not require public financing, provide no protection against the emergence of such a tyrant, either. 
 The fund-raising success of the Obama campaign, however, has demonstrated that if enough people are willing to withhold donations to politicians who do not credibly refuse to rely on large private contributions, voters have the power to eliminate the fundamental conflicts of interest that have corrupted American politics in recent decades. Because of the First Amendment constraint, that's something McCain-Feingold and other campaign finance laws simply cannot deliver by themselves.

HEADLINE: Asleep At the Spigot

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Jad Mouawad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
 JUST three years ago, with oil trading at a seemingly frothy $66 a barrel, David J. O'Reilly made what many experts considered a risky bet. Outmaneuvering Chinese bidders and ignoring critics who said he overpaid, Mr. O'Reilly, the chief executive of Chevron, forked over $18 billion to buy Unocal, a giant whose riches date back to oil fields made famous in the film ''There Will Be Blood.''
 For Chevron, the deal proved to be a movie-worthy gusher, helping its profits to soar. And while he has warned about tightening energy supplies for years and looks prescient for buying Unocal, even Mr. O'Reilly says that he still can't get his head around current oil prices, which closed above $145 a barrel on Thursday, a record.
 ''We can see how you can get to $100,'' he says. ''At $140, I just don't know how to explain it. We're surprised.'' 
 For the rest of the country, the feeling is more like shock. As gasoline prices climb beyond $4 a gallon, Americans are rethinking what they drive and how and where they live. Entire industries are reeling -- airlines and automakers most prominent among them -- and gas prices have emerged as an important issue in the presidential campaign. 
 Ninety percent of Americans, meanwhile, expect the pain at the pump to pose a financial hardship in the next six months, according to a recent Associated Press-Yahoo News poll. Stocks now trade inversely to crude prices, and the Dow Jones industrials are in bear-market territory. Old icons have been written off, with Starbucks boasting nearly twice the market value of General Motors, which some on Wall Street say faces the possibility of bankruptcy.
 Outside the thriving oil patch, it makes for a bleak economic picture. But it didn't have to be this way.
 Over the last 25 years, opportunities to head off the current crisis were ignored, missed or deliberately blocked, according to analysts, politicians and veterans of the oil and automobile industries. What's more, for all the surprise at just how high oil prices have climbed, and fears for the future, this is one crisis we were warned about. Ever since the oil shortages of the 1970s, one report after another has cautioned against America's oil addiction. 
 Even as politicians heatedly debate opening new regions to drilling, corralling energy speculators, or starting an Apollo-like effort to find renewable energy supplies, analysts say the real source of the problem is closer to home. In fact, it's parked in our driveways.
 Nearly 70 percent of the 21 million barrels of oil the United States consumes every day goes for transportation, with the bulk of that burned by individual drivers, according to the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan research group that advises Congress. 
 SO despite the fierce debate over what's behind the recent spike in prices, no one differs on what's really responsible for all that underlying demand here for black gold: the automobile, fueled not only by gasoline but also by Americans' famous propensity for voracious consumption.
 To be sure, the American appetite for crude oil is only one reason for the recent price surge. But the country's dependence on imported oil has only kept growing in recent years, undermining the trade balance and putting an added strain on global supplies. 
 Although the road to $4 gasoline and increased oil dependence has been paved in places like Detroit, Houston and Riyadh, it runs through Washington as well, where policy makers have let the problem make lengthy pit stops.
 ''Much of what we're seeing today could have been prevented or ameliorated had we chosen to act differently,'' says Pete V. Domenici, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a 36-year veteran of the Senate. ''It was a bipartisan failure to act.'' 
 Mike Jackson, the chief executive of AutoNation, the country's biggest automobile retailer, is even more blunt. ''It was totally preventable,'' he says, anger creeping into his affable car-salesman's pitch.
 The speed at which gas prices are climbing is forcing a seismic change in long-held American habits, from car-buying to commuting. Last week, Ford Motor reported that S.U.V. sales were down 55 percent from a year ago, while demand for its full-size F-series pickup, a gas guzzler that was the country's best-selling vehicle for 26 consecutive years, is off 40 percent. The only Ford model to show a sales increase was the midsized Fusion. A Ford spokeswoman says the market shift is ''totally unprecedented and faster than anything we've ever seen.''
 If the latest rise in oil prices isn't just another spike -- like those of the 1970s and 1980s -- but is instead a fundamental repricing of the commodity responsible for much of modern American life, the impact of that change will affect everyone from home builders and homeowners in exurbs to corporate leaders, landlords and commuters in cities. 
 Although Asian consumers have begun emulating America's love affair with the automobile, with the commercial booms of China and India playing pivotal roles in increased oil demand, the largest energy appetite in the world is still found in the United States. Home to only 4 percent of the world's population, the nation slurps up about a quarter of the planet's oil -- and Americans' daily use is nearly twice the combined consumption of the Chinese and Indians, according to an annual energy survey published by BP, the British oil giant.
 Indeed, low-priced gasoline has long been part of the American social contract, according to Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and Republican leader. While in office, Mr. Gingrich battled efforts to modulate demand through tools like increased gas taxes and tighter fuel standards, and he argues that voters won't support such measures even now. 
 ''They will work if you coerce the entire system and if you pretend the American people are Japanese and Europeans,'' Mr. Gingrich says. ''Our culture favors driving long distances in powerful vehicles and the car as a social expression.''
 Perhaps, but on Capitol Hill, members of both parties now say they are furious with Detroit for fighting so hard, and for so long, against higher fuel-efficiency standards. 
 Though analysts say automakers who shoveled out highly profitable and highly inefficient road hogs like S.U.V.'s and pickups deserve much of the blame, they also criticize legislators who failed to provide an incentive for consumers to switch to fuel-sipping cars. Some politicians are quick to acknowledge the problem.
 ''We've got to fix it or our standard of living will change within a decade,'' says Senator Domenici, who is retiring this year. ''Oil was too damn cheap, it's too high now and it's going even higher. I hope I'm wrong, but the problem is, we can't catch up soon enough.''
 According to energy policy experts, it was in the late 1980s and early 1990s -- during the administrations of President George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton -- that things began to go wrong.
 Before that point, the country reaped the benefits of the first fuel-economy standards, passed in 1975, known as corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE. Between 1974 and 1989, the efficiency of a typical car sold in the United States almost doubled, to 27.5 miles per gallon from 13.8.
 LARGELY as a result, oil consumption in 1990 totaled 16.9 million barrels, basically on a par with the 17 million barrels consumed in 1980, even as the economy grew substantially. Oil prices were in the middle of a long downward slide that would take them from well above $30 a barrel in 1980 to a low of just under $10 in late 1998 and early 1999, interrupted only by brief spike in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
 In 1990, Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat, teamed up in the Senate with Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, and proposed lifting fuel standards again over the next decade, with a goal of 40 m.p.g. for cars. Amid furious opposition from Detroit, liberal Democrats from automaking states, like Carl Levin of Michigan, joined conservative Republicans like Jesse Helms of North Carolina to block new CAFE standards. ''It was one of the most frustrating issues in my Senate career,'' says Mr. Gorton, who left the Senate in 2001. 
 Dan Becker, then a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, still remembers his shock when he saw Mr. Levin and Mr. Helms, diametrically opposed on most issues, walk amiably together onto the Senate floor to cast their votes. ''This wasn't East-West, right-left, or North-South,'' he says. ''But had we passed that bill, we'd be using three million barrels less oil a day now.'' 
 That amount may not sound like much, given total global consumption of 85 million barrels a day, but it's more than OPEC's spare capacity now.
 Mr. Levin didn't return calls for comment. (Mr. Helms died on Friday.) But Representative John D. Dingell, the powerful Democrat from Detroit who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, argues -- as he did more than a decade ago -- that tightening CAFE standards unfairly penalizes domestic automakers while rewarding foreign rivals who make more small cars. 
 Mr. Dingell, who has defended the automakers fiercely during his 52 years on Capitol Hill, decided to support the stronger CAFE standards last year. But he does not apologize for his longtime stance. ''The American auto industry has sold the cars people wanted,'' he says. ''You're going to blame the auto industry for that or the American consumer? He likes it sitting in his driveway, he likes it big, he likes it safe.''
 A much more effective approach would be to simply raise taxes on gasoline, Mr. Dingell says, because higher prices are the easiest way to change buying habits. Some Europeans agree with this, noting that policy changes engineered through taxation can alter consumer choices without impeding economic growth.
 Consumers overseas might not like higher taxes on gasoline, but they've adapted, says Jeroen van der Veer, chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, the European energy giant. ''A society can work, can function and can grow even at higher fuel prices,'' he says. ''It's a way of life -- you get used to it.''
 In Mr. van der Veer's native Holland, for example, gasoline sells for more than $10 a gallon, with $5.57 of that going to taxes. Even in Britain, which has substantial North Sea production, gasoline sells for $8.71 a gallon.
 A SUBSTANTIAL gas tax increase was considered during the administration of the first President Bush, recalls William K. Reilly, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency at the time. But it was whittled down in 1990 to just 5 cents after Mr. Gingrich and other conservatives in the Republican Party broke with the president. 
 ''This was a stark lesson and people decided the gas tax was the third rail of public policy,'' Mr. Reilly says.
 Even as Congress idled when it came to tightening CAFE standards or substantially raising levies on gas, the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 made offshore drilling yet another unpalatable option. ''That caused a sea change and after that no one had any sympathy for the oil industry,'' Mr. Becker says. 
 In 1990, three months before the effort to raise fuel-efficiency standards failed on Capitol Hill, President Bush issued an executive order making large swaths of the continental shelf off-limits to new exploration. That policy remains in effect today.
 When Senators Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, and Frank H. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, attempted to put together a grand bargain of opening up more of Alaska in exchange for raising auto efficiency in 1998, the two couldn't persuade enough members of either party to go along.
 ''It was a no-action policy,'' says Lee R. Raymond, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who has had a ringside seat for most of the energy policy debates of the last 25 years. ''By the time there is panic, people need to realize this: There is no quick-fix on this. By the time you panic, it is way too late.''
 Still, many analysts argue that increased drilling alone is no panacea. They note that many of the oil giants don't drill in areas to which they already have access. Exxon, in particular, has been criticized as spending too much to buy back its own stock and not enough on exploration. Chris Welberry, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, defends the company's record, saying, ''We are investing in our business at record levels -- around $25 billion this year.''
 In any event, added drilling is unlikely to generate sharply lower prices. A recent study by the federal government's Energy Information Administration estimated that under the best-case scenario opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would reduce prices by $1.44 a barrel by 2027. Drilling in broader swaths off the continental United States wouldn't affect prices until 2030.
 On the taxation frontier, President Clinton did manage to get through a small tax increase on gasoline -- 4.3 cents -- in 1993, but with oil prices hovering between $10 and $20 a barrel for most of the 1990s, conservation ended up on the back burner. 
 Indeed, President Clinton did propose a broader tax on energy consumption in 1993, but it died quickly when Senate Democrats rebelled, much as House Republicans derailed President Bush's gas tax in 1990. Still, environmentalists like Mr. Becker remain disappointed with Mr. Clinton for not doing more in his first term when oil prices were low and Detroit was enjoying a recovery in profits after the lean years of the early 1990s.
 Congressional Republicans made matters worse in 1995, when they attached a rider to a huge appropriations bill forbidding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from spending any money to raise fuel standards. That law, in effect until 2001, made any change in CAFE standards impossible, says Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has pushed for better fuel efficiency.
 As Paul Bledsoe, strategy director of the National Commission on Energy Policy, recalls it, ''The 1990s were something of a lost decade for American fuel efficiency.'' With oil prices low, consumers began snapping up pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, which were governed by less stringent fuel economy standards, thanks to a loophole in the original 1975 law. These carried higher sticker prices and profit margins, and both Detroit and foreign automakers were happy to oblige.
 Although oil prices remained low through the 1990s, consumption patterns were taking an ominous turn. By 2000, daily demand reached 19.7 million barrels a day -- nearly three million more than in 1990, a 17 percent jump in 10 years that wiped out much of the fuel savings that followed the energy crises of the 1970s.
 Since then, global consumption has taken off, rising to 85.2 million barrels a day last year from 76.3 million in 2000. 
 In recent years, Mr. Reilly says that both the White House and Congress have passed up opportunities to call for higher gas taxes and fuel standards in the name of national security, especially after the Sept. 11 attacks. ''We could have, but we didn't,'' says Mr. Reilly, who describes himself as a moderate Republican. ''It's part of a long pattern in which Democrats and Republicans have not wanted to wade into this issue.'' 
 BY 2001, oil prices were slowly creeping up, but few seemed to notice, perhaps because the march was slow and steady. By 2004, crude was at $37 a barrel and the next year it hit $50. With higher prices for oil, an increase in gas taxes was political poison, but Mr. Markey says support for new fuel standards was reawakening.
 Nevertheless, his efforts to pass new fuel economy legislation in 2001, 2003, and 2005 went nowhere amid continued opposition by supporters of the auto industry on both sides of the aisle as well as many conservative Republicans. Although the United States had long ceased to be energy-independent -- that era ended just after World War II -- Mr. Markey says he believes the memory of plentiful domestic supplies created a different mind-set here than in Europe, where oil was generally scarce.
 Other veterans of those battles cite lobbying by the domestic automakers as a main factor in the failure of Mr. Markey's legislation. ''The auto companies didn't see the handwriting on the wall,'' Mr. Schumer says. ''The auto companies would go to people and say, 'If you vote for CAFE standards, the auto plant in your district could shut down.' They got the message.''
 Representative Mike Castle, a Delaware Republican whose district includes plants owned by G.M. and Chrysler, adds that ''nothing was ever said directly but it would go through the minds of members that Detroit might respond.''
 ''Sometimes, things don't have to be said,'' he added.
 Susan M. Cischke, group vice president for sustainability, environment and safety engineering at Ford, says the recollections of Mr. Schumer and Mr. Castle are ''way over the top -- you don't just pull up or put down auto plants.'' Instead, she says, when lobbying on CAFE, ''we talked with our friends and indicated what it did with jobs. You want support.''
 Oil industry insiders say they remained on the sidelines during Congressional debates over CAFE standards, although legislators from oil states tended to vote against more rigorous rules. 
 In 2007, with oil at $82 and gas nearing $3, Congress finally approved the first big increase in fuel-efficiency standards in 32 years, requiring the fleet average to reach 35 m.p.g. by 2020. That will save one million barrels a day by 2020, but onetime CAFE opponents like Mr. Castle now say they wish that Congress had acted sooner. Since the 1980s, fuel efficiency has flatlined at 24 m.p.g., while vehicle weight has jumped more than 25 percent and horsepower has nearly doubled. In Europe, on the other hand, fuel efficiency currently stands at 44 m.p.g. and is slated to hit 48 m.p.g. by 2012. 
 ''It's a shame we're doing this now instead of 10 or 20 years ago,'' says Mr. Castle, who supported the legislation last year. ''It was always my hope they would just do it without a mandate.'' He adds that while he still opposes drilling in Alaska, ''Republicans aren't all wrong when they talk about increasing supplies of oil. There are opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico.'' 
 Senator Domenici, the senior New Mexico Republican, agrees that it's time to look at new supplies but is even more critical of Detroit. ''They all said to us: 'Don't change CAFE. It'll come when it's supposed to.' That's baloney,'' he said.
 UNTIL last year's vote, Mr. Domenici was an opponent of new fuel-efficiency standards, a stance he now regards as a mistake. ''We were like everybody else,'' he says. ''We should have been more active on CAFE sooner.''
 With Detroit again seeing profits collapse as sales of big cars plunge, Mr. Domenici says he is worried about the survival of the domestic automakers.
 ''They talked a good research game,'' he says. ''But let's face it, little was being done. They are suffering the consequences and could go broke just like the airlines.''
 What Congress didn't or couldn't do, the free market is now doing in the form of higher gas prices: forcing Americans into more fuel-efficient cars. Ms. Cischke of Ford says that in the last two months, ''We have seen more of a shift in the market than in 20 years of CAFE. People are buying what they need.'' 
 Unfortunately, the shift is happening too fast for a company of Ford's size. That is among the reasons Wall Street expects Ford to lose more than $2 billion this year.
 Congress, meanwhile, in its bid to explain the run-up in fuel prices, is examining the role of speculation and the increased flow of investor money into commodities. Most energy economists emphasize the fundamental issue of supply and demand, rather than market manipulation, but financial factors like the weak dollar are also exacerbating the situation. Stephen P. A. Brown, director of energy economics and microeconomic policy analysis at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, estimates that a little more than 20 percent of the price of oil today can be attributed to the dollar's fall against the euro and other currencies.
 Another financial factor behind the price rise that hasn't been talked about much on Capitol Hill or elsewhere is reduced hedging by oil companies on futures markets, says Larry Goldstein, a longtime energy analyst. In the past, crude producers would offer buyers a portion of their energy output in future years in order to protect themselves if prices pulled back. But energy companies got burned as prices kept rising during the last two years and have since cut back on selling untapped production -- forcing prices for energy futures even higher.
 Now, the prospect of a perpetual climb in oil prices has become part of market psychology, which is notoriously hard to change. William H. Brown III, a former Wall Street energy analyst who now consults for hedge funds and financial institutions, says investors have become convinced that the White House and Congress are unlikely to do anything dramatic to bring down prices. 
 For example, a release of supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after disruptions in Nigeria or Venezuela might have persuaded the market that Washington was on the case and shaken some complacency out of the market. ''I've been a little surprised at what has not been done or what has not been talked about to get a handle on the consumer situation,'' Mr. Brown says. 
 Others say that although the push to blame market speculators rather than discuss economic realities is likely to intensify on Capitol Hill as the presidential election draws near, they believe that what the world is confronting is a momentous shift in energy supply and demand. 
 ''Speculation and manipulation are two different things,'' says Mr. O'Reilly of Chevron. ''Most of where we are is because of fundamentals and concern about the future.''

HEADLINE: The Needy and Budget Priorities

 BODY:
These are tough times. But the newly passed $59.1 billion New York City budget cut nearly $300 million in spending, a good part of it for programs meant to protect the city's most vulnerable people, including the elderly, youth, the unemployed, people who need legal aid and those with H.I.V. and AIDS. 
 Traditionally, New York mayors propose cuts needed to balance the budget as required by law, and then the City Council fights to restore funds to education, health and other social programs. Not this year. With the fiscal picture worsening as revenues falter, the Council drew a narrow line in the sand over education and little else, finding some $129 million for the schools.
 That is welcome. But what the Council members refused to do is far more important. Eager to save their own political skins before the 2009 election (more than 20 of the 51 members are already preparing to run), they rejected Mayor Michael Bloomberg's call to rescind the 7 percent property tax cut. That alone would have raised $1.2 billion. They could have generated $200 million simply by cutting in half the yearly $400 property tax rebate. 
 Even with these breaks taken away, owners of single-family homes would still pay taxes at a lower rate than their counterparts in surrounding communities. 
 Instead, lawmakers called on Mr. Bloomberg to loosen his grip on a surplus of more than $4.6 billion. The mayor did the fiscally sound thing; with the city almost certainly headed for several years of hard times, he committed the money to pay down a portion of future budget shortfalls and obligations that continue to grow. The recently settled police officers' contract may cost the city $1 billion in raises. Council members even suggested a new hotel tax, which makes little sense for a city that should be encouraging even more visitors to come and spend.
 The property tax breaks were supposed to be temporary, there to be lifted when New York needed them, like now. The city's politicians chose to protect themselves rather than New York's most vulnerable. That was the wrong choice.

HEADLINE: Failures in the Fight Against Drugs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Not Winning the War on Drugs,'' your July 2 editorial about the importance of treating drug addicts and recognizing that drug abuse is a public health problem and not just a criminal problem, is on the mark.
 The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University has done analyses of the nation's prison population that show that 80 percent of felony inmates and juvenile arrestees either committed their crime while high on alcohol or drugs, stole money to buy drugs, have a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse and addiction, violated the alcohol or drug laws, or share some combination of those characteristics. 
 The reports of our analyses demonstrate that if all inmates and arrestees who need treatment received it and the success rate were only 10 percent, the cost of treatment would be recouped in a year, and thereafter the economic benefits in productivity, taxes and reduction in criminal activity would approach $10 billion a year.
 Moreover, we would experience a dramatic reduction in crime since experts estimate that an addict averages between 89 and 191 crimes a year.

 The writer is chairman and president, National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
 To the Editor:
 It is time to recognize that the war on drugs is simply not winnable. Prohibition didn't stop people from consuming alcohol, and the war on drugs will never stop them from using drugs. 
 Until our policy makers come to grips with that reality, we will continue to suffer from a drug policy that creates a vicious black market economy and wastes billions of dollars on futile interdiction efforts.
 Jerry Wallingford
 San Diego, July 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial, while accurate, misses the overarching point. Prohibition failed in the past, and it is not working now. The scarce tax dollars currently being wasted by the White House on quixotic interdiction adventures pale in comparison to the decades of tax revenues we haven't been collecting because of prohibition.
 These funds could help pay for honest drug education, free drug treatment on demand and better health care -- all things we need right now. 
 Instead of flawed government hype, we need policy alternatives to the drug war that uphold the sovereignty of individuals over their minds and bodies and are grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights. 
 Anthony Papa

 New York, July 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial includes powerful information on the futility of the United States war on drugs but then makes the fatuous recommendation that the next administration should provide funds to reform Mexico's judicial system -- a process that is already under way. 
 Mexico faces a killing spree affecting thousands of innocent people that is financed by American money going to the drug cartels that fight for dominance of the lucrative United States market for illegal drugs. The earnings from this trade amount to at least $15 billion a year -- enough to buy arms to outgun the Mexican police and bribe underpaid security officials.
 We can't buy our way out of this culpability with a few hundred million dollars of aid and irrelevant advice. The remedies lie on our side of the border. We need to curb demand by treating our addicts and by decriminalizing drug use, reduce the street price of drugs and thus the gains of the drug lords.
 Sidney Weintraub
 Washington, July 2, 2008
 The writer is an economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial made an important point about the need for more effort to reduce the demand for drugs. 
 The United States should devote more resources to preventing and treating substance abuse and dependence. But these resources should be allocated based on need. 
 Alcohol is the drug of choice for the overwhelming majority of people suffering from a substance use disorder. According to the 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, nearly 16 million Americans were dependent on or abusing alcohol. That's five times greater than the number of people who were dependent on or abusing illicit drugs and almost 15 times greater than the number of people dependent on or abusing cocaine. 
 Rather than spend billions of dollars on foreign intrigues and high-profile cocaine seizures, the next administration should do more to address the greatest source of drug-related problems in the United States: alcohol.

To the Editor:
 The front-page photograph and the photograph accompanying ''Car Sales at a 10-Year Low'' (Business Day, July 2) of unsold sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks jammed on car dealers' lots are sad evidence that the United States has been steered in the wrong direction on automobile fuel economy. 
 For way too many years, auto industry executives, union leaders and their Congressional and executive branch enablers, on both sides of the aisle, made the mistake of exempting S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks from the federal fuel economy requirements. 
 Focused on selling high-margin, gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and trucks, the American automobile industry fell behind manufacturers in other countries, especially those from Germany and Japan, in developing fuel-efficient sedans that perform well. 
 Unfortunately, we're all paying the price for the shortsightedness of our leaders.

 IN THE FORMER GARDEN OF IRAQ,
 A Fragile Peace Is Progress
 Diyala Province, once the garden of Iraq, more recently has been known as one of the country's worst killing fields and the headquarters of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. A visit in late June showed that military operations over the past 12 months had curbed the worst of the province's violence, but that the situation there defines the word ''fragile.'' PAGE A5
 URANIUM SHIPPED OUT OF IRAQ
 American and Iraqi officials have completed nearly the last chapter in dismantling Saddam Hussein's nuclear program with the removal of hundreds of tons of natural uranium from the country's main nuclear site. It arrived in Canada last week, sold and shipped out because of fears that in Iraq's unstable environment, it could fall into the wrong hands. PAGE A6 
 BUSH DEFENDS ATTENDING OLYMPICS
 President Bush, in Japan to talk to world leaders about climate change, soaring oil and gas prices and aid to Africa, first defended his decision to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing next month. Not going ''would be an affront to the Chinese people'' that might make it ''more difficult to be able to speak frankly with the Chinese leadership,'' he said. PAGE A10
 CIVILIANS SAID KILLED IN U.S. STRIKE
 Local officials in eastern Afghanistan said that an American airstrike killed at least 27 civilians in a wedding party, most of them women and children and including the bride. Officials of the American-led coalition disputed the report, saying that the strike killed militants. The attack was the second in the past three days in which many civilian deaths were reported, both disputed by the United States military. PAGE A6
 CHINA SEEKING TO CLEAR AIR
 As part of a broader effort to clear polluted skies before the Beijing Olympics in August, the nearby industrial port of Tianjin has ordered 40 factories to suspend some operations for two months. The overall plan is expected to result in temporary factory closings or slowdowns across a large swath of northern China during the Games. PAGE A10
 A UNION MAY JUST BE SHOW
 Perhaps the grandest idea of President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was the Union of the Mediterranean, an upgrading of a languishing effort of the European Union that was intended to help develop the Muslim nations on the Mediterranean's southern rim and support Israeli-Arab reconciliation. It will be inaugurated next week, but it has created resistance among vital allies, and the result may be more show than substance. PAGE A11

 ECONOMY SETS STRATEGIES
 For Presidential Candidates
 With bad economic news coming from every direction -- six consecutive months of job losses, rising rates of home foreclosures, gasoline prices seemingly headed toward $5 a gallon -- the campaigns of Senators Barack Obama and John McCain are retooling strategies and preparing for what aides said would be months of economic speeches and town-hall-style meetings on the economy. But both face political problems with the issue. PAGE A13
 GROUP UNVEILS ANTI-OBAMA ADS
 A newly formed Republican group broadcast its first commercial in four battleground states as part of a $3 million advertising campaign aimed at Senator Barack Obama. The advertisement highlights Senator John McCain's differences with his own party on energy policy, and refers to Mr. Obama's positions on energy as ''just the party line'' -- a reference to Mr. Obama's opposition to suspending gas taxes or drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.Mr. Obama and other Democrats contend that a McCain presidency would represent a third Bush term. PAGE A15
 LOOKING BEYOND THE WHITE HOUSE
 Democrats are dreaming big this summer, with Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee-apparent, vowing to run campaigns in all 50 states. And though some are improbable targets at the presidential level, like Alaska (Republican victory margin in 2004: 25 percentage points), Democratic candidates for the House and Senate stand to benefit from the Obama campaign's work in registering and turning out voters. The Caucus. PAGE A15
 NEW YORK REPORT
 CITY IS BEING ASKED
 To Rethink Housing Fees
 Every year, the city charges the New York City Housing Authority about $200 million, for everything from water to trash pickup to police services. The charges are a result of agreements the agency made with the city, some decades old. But with the housing authority struggling with a $170 million budget shortfall, the city is under pressure to rethink the fees. PAGE A16
 ACCIDENT LOPS OFF CONCORDE NOSE
 The supersonic passenger jet known as Alpha Delta made it through nearly 30 years of speeding back and forth over the Atlantic Ocean unscathed. But in less than two years of retirement in Brooklyn, it already has had its distinctive pointy nose knocked off, a victim of a run-in with a truck that was hauling equipment from a music and soccer festival. PAGE A19

 ENTERING THE MUSIC BUSINESS
 To Help Sell Sneakers
 Times may seem turbulent in the music business, with online file-sharing rampant, record stores closing and consumers buying singles instead of albums. Record labels are struggling to adjust to a harsh new digital reality. But other companies -- like Procter & Gamble, Red Bull and Nike -- are stepping outside of their core businesses to promote, finance and even distribute music themselves. PAGE C1
 IGNORING A BEST SELLER
 Vincent Bugliosi is accustomed to buzz about his books, having written three No. 1 best sellers. His latest is a best seller, too, but not with any help from the publicity circuit: For some reason, media outlets are not inviting him to talk about ''The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder,'' in which he lays a legal case for holding President Bush ''criminally responsible'' for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq. PAGE C4
 WHEN FOX NEWS IS NEWS
 For a print journalist faced with writing about Fox News, David Carr says in The Media Equation, the prospect carries with it a certain risk. The approach may ward off some negative comments about Fox, but it cuts both ways, he adds, noting, for example, ''Fox News's amazing coup d'etat in the cable news war has very likely been undercovered because the organization is such a handful to deal with.'' PAGE C1
 THE COMING TV TRANSITION
 As of next February people who have analog TVs will no longer get any picture unless they have cable service or a digital converter box, a fact that consumer advocates say needs more public awareness. But some people who know about it still resist the change, for one reason or another, and Washington officials worry that millions of them will lose access to an important lifeline. PAGE C2
 PUBLISH IN HASTE? UNPUBLISH
 Internet technology not only allows anyone with the means to publish, it also allows that anyone to unpublish, which no doubt is a blessing for many an obscure blogger with sober second thoughts.

 Networks have agreed to use ratings for commercials, instead of programs, as the standard for sales to advertisers. So for the 2008-9 television season, they are looking at a variety of unconventional approaches to keep viewers from wandering off -- or fast-forwarding -- during breaks. Be advised: Descriptions of their efforts include phrases like ''creative insinuation'' and ''being intrusive without seeming intrusive.'' PAGE C6
 SPORTS
 LEAVE THE STICKY BUN,
 Take the Granola
 Nutritionists say that eating habits play a big part in how players fare on the green. So if you're trying to look like Woods or Nicklaus, skip that midround hot dog and beer. ''If you're having a social round of golf, maybe that's O.K., but if you want to play well, those are completely nonsensical choices,'' one nutritionist said. ''Throw the hot dog away and eat the bun; that has carbohydrates.'' Bill Pennington, On Par. PAGE D5
 BIG-HEARTED ATHLETES
 Resting inside the chests of the United States men's Olympic rowing team are enormous, elongated, torpedo-shaped hearts, twice the mass of a normal heart, that draw blood in like a suction pump and push it out like a piston. And as they trained harder, as the Beijing Olympics drew closer, they grew even larger. So is this a dangerous condition, or an advantageous adaptation for elite athletes? PAGE D1
 NORWEGIAN EARNS TOUR WIN
 In cycling-mad France, spectators hoping for a French victory on the second stage of the Tour de France had their hopes dashed when the Frenchmen who looked most likely to win for much of the day eventually fell to Thor Hushovd, a Norwegian. But it may have been a consolation prize of sorts, as Mr. Hushovd is the sprinter for a French team, Credit Agricole. PAGE D2
 ALL-STAR ROSTERS ANNOUNCED
 When the rosters for Major League Baseball's All-Star Game were announced, there were the usual familiar faces, some new ones, and a few surprises, like Jason Varitek, who has struggled mightily at the plate this season. Since the game will be held at Yankee Stadium, Varitek and the other seven members of the rival Boston Red Sox selected for the game will have to face the odd sensation of dressing in the enemy's locker room.

 BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG, 377 FEET
 In Circumference and 42 Feet Tall
 When it opened in 1884, the Gettysburg Cyclorama, an enormous wraparound painting that depicts the Battle of Gettysburg, made veterans cry. Touted as a ''sublime spectacle,'' the painting traveled from city to city, and the enthralled lined up by the hundreds to feel enveloped by a historic moment. After a five-year, $15 million restoration, viewers will for the first time in more than a century see the work as its artist originally intended. PAGE E1 
 A HAPPY ENDING IN VERONA
 In Prokofiev's 1936 account of the ballet ''Romeo and Juliet,'' now having its world premiere at Bard Summerscape after the score was found in Russian archives, both lovers are saved from death. They are also given a dance-dance-dance apotheosis, choreographed by Mark Morris. The result, Alastair Macaulay writes, is camp and artificial. PAGE E1 
 MOVIE MOGUL MAKES IT ON TV
 ''Fox Legacy,'' a show hosted by Tom Rothman, the co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, has developed a surprise cult following. Mr. Rothman receives fan mail, more episodes are on order, and Fox Movie Channel is campaigning for an Emmy nomination. All of which makes Mr. Rothman one of the rarest of Hollywood specimens: the executive who does not become a punch line in front of a camera. PAGE E1 
 OPERA AT THE ARMORY
 The Park Avenue Armory is for the first time the site of a major operatic production. And not just any opera, but ''Die Soldaten,'' which is legendary for its challenges, among them the composer Bernd Alois Zimmermann's wish that it be staged on 12 separate acting areas. The armory staging makes possible the fluidity envisioned. Now, if only the acoustics were better. A review by Anthony Tommasini. PAGE E1 
 A BAFFLED BLUE BLOOD
 The protagonist of Michael Dahlie's novel ''A Gentleman's Guide to Graceful Living'' burns down the beloved Catskill fly-fishing lodge founded in 1878 by his great-grandfather in the same way he destroys his marriage and his family's import-export business: haplessly. But instead of taking satirical potshots at the central character's cluelessness, Janet Maslin writes, Mr. Dahlie's debut novel takes a surprising tack: It deals affectionately with his frailties.

 ''Hancock,'' Sony Pictures Entertainment's action movie about a damaged superhero, scored $66 million in domestic ticket sales over the weekend, for a total of $107.3 million at the domestic box office since its opening.

PERSON: Christopher O. Ward 

HEADLINE: Port Authority, Often Tangled, Gets an Infusion of Philosophy

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Just over a month into his tenure as the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Christopher O. Ward burst into the consciousness of most New Yorkers last week with the blunt revelation that construction at ground zero would run longer and cost much more than announced because officials had promised too much. 
 It was perhaps not surprising that Mr. Ward, who was involved in the planning for the World Trade Center site after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, defended the officials, even as he disowned the troubled financing and timeline. More surprising, maybe, was that he invoked the philosopher and poet George Santayana to do so.
 ''Were there overly aggressive dates set? Probably for the right reasons in some ways,'' he said in an interview last week at his office on Park Avenue South. 
 Then he turned to Mr. Santayana's notion that people need a dramatic narrative to define themselves and to choose what is important. ''This was just an unbelievable event that tore into the fabric and the mind of the city, and the need for drama to say, 'This is who we are,' set some unreasonable expectations,'' he said.
 Part bureaucrat, part politician, part intellectual -- he has a master's degree in divinity from Harvard -- Mr. Ward will need all of those attributes to put the trade center project on track. In a report that Mr. Ward oversaw, the authority said last week that many parts of the sprawling reconstruction plan were a year or more behind schedule, including the 9/11 memorial, which will not be open by the 10th anniversary of the attack. Already estimated to cost $16 billion, the price is almost certain to rise by billions more.
 To succeed, Mr. Ward will have to be both polished diplomat and hardened task master, given the powerful emotions, political minefields and competing constituencies involved in the endeavor. His friends and allies say that he is the man for that job, with the right mix of intuition and pragmatism to be able to respond to public officials, advocates and citizens alike. His successes over 20 years in public service -- for the city and the Port Authority -- include pushing through enormous and knotty projects like the AirTrain to Kennedy International Airport and the Croton water filtration plant in the Bronx. 
 ''We have a process for building public works,'' said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a policy group, to describe a system that is often logjammed by conflict and debate: ''This is called 'Getting to No' -- hopefully nothing happens,'' Mr. Yaro said. ''Chris is one of a handful of people who really knows how to master these projects, and particularly these big bureaucracies that deliver them.'' 
 But Mr. Ward, 53, has also gained his share of critics as he has moved from city government to the Port Authority to the private sector and back again. State Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, of the Bronx, who opposed building the filtration plant beneath Van Cortlandt Park, said he believed that Mr. Ward, then commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, had misled residents and officials to gain support for the project. It rankled many Bronx residents from the onset and is now facing cost overruns.
 ''He led people to believe that this project in the Bronx would be much cheaper than it was going to be and that it was going to provide many more jobs for Bronxites than it was going to in order to convince enough elected officials in the Bronx to support this,'' Mr. Dinowitz said. 
 Mr. Ward, a focused, physically imposing but affable man who bristled when asked how he viewed the water project in light of its troubles, offered an impassioned defense that ended with a self-deprecating, ''That's a speech.''
 ''You're talking about protecting maybe 15 percent of the city's water supply for the rest of the city's future,'' he said. ''There are clearly health reasons to filter the Croton water, and if somebody's going to tell me that a dollar shouldn't be spent to make sure that water's safe, I'd make that decision time and time again.''
 That sort of decisiveness, current and former government officials say, is what will help Mr. Ward navigate the challenges facing the Port Authority, which extend far beyond the high-profile morass at ground zero. The staff has never fully recovered from its losses in the 2001 attack, experts say, and projects have stalled amid political infighting over the competing agendas of New York and New Jersey. 
 Arguably the nation's pre-eminent public authority and port builder, the agency is a behemoth, with an annual budget of nearly $6 billion. It is responsible for moving millions of people around the region, operating the Hudson River crossings, bus terminals, airports, the PATH system and the seaport. And with plans for $29 billion in capital investments by 2016, it acts as a kind of bank for major projects across the region. 
 Indeed, it will fall to Mr. Ward to help resolve turf battles and financing problems for several big projects, like the revamping of Pennsylvania Station and the building of a new tunnel beneath the Hudson, even in a weakened economy. Still, Mr. Ward is full of grand plans for the authority, having attained what he calls an ''it'' job. 
 For someone in government, he said, ''It's the show.''
 Mr. Ward's interest in public service seems rooted in his push-me-pull-you relationship with the rarefied academic precincts in which he grew up. Born in Princeton, N.J., Christopher Owen Ward was the middle child of three boys; his father, John William Ward, was a leading scholar in American Studies and became the president of Amherst College. 
 Mr. Ward's middle name was his own invention, taken in the fourth grade from both the maiden name of his maternal great-grandmother and the first name of his best friend that year, spent in California while his father taught at Stanford. 
 Mr. Ward became attracted to religious studies while at Macalester College in St. Paul, after he decided that he was not a historian like his father and older brother, then a graduate student at Yale. After he graduated in 1976, he went to work on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico -- an ''incubator of personalities,'' he called it. There he learned how to get along with a diverse group of oil riggers.
 Still fascinated by what he calls a ''fundamental question of life'' -- how to act ethically without a belief in God -- and enamored of the intellectual rigor of theology, he earned a master's degree from Harvard. But realizing that the academic world was not for him, he landed a job through a friend at the city Department of Consumer Affairs. 
 From there came jobs in the mayor's office, where he devised ways to sell inexpensive power to companies, and the Economic Development Corporation, where he worked in transportation. After a brief stint working for an upstart port operator on the Brooklyn waterfront called American Stevedoring, Mr. Ward found himself as a senior executive at the Port Authority, where he stayed from 1997 to 2002. 
 It was there that Mr. Ward had one of his first high-profile successes, winning over seven community boards, the City Council and the mayor to support the AirTrain link to Kennedy Airport, a project that had languished for years, several of Mr. Ward's supporters said. 
 In 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg named him to head the Department of Environmental Protection, where he shepherded the controversial Croton filtration plant. Tensions ran so high that opponents picketed his Upper West Side home, distributing fliers throughout his building calling him an environmental racist for seeking to put the plant in a largely black and Hispanic area.
 Mr. Ward is still clearly stung by that experience, but none of it has dampened his zeal for the complexities of the job. Determined that the Port Authority remain a master builder, creating new assets as opposed to simply preserving existing ones, Mr. Ward at times sounds as expansionist as Andrew Jackson, the subject of a seminal American Studies text written by his father. 
 ''Urban centers are these machines, if you will, that are creating wealth and capacity,'' he said. ''Are they the right machines today to be productive in the future, given rising fuel prices, given congestion, given fundamental questions of urban health? Those are the things the Port Authority's going to have to be a part of and really address.''

HEADLINE: We Should Still Like Ike

BYLINE: By JEAN EDWARD SMITH. 
Jean Edward Smith is the author, most recently, of ''F.D.R.''

DATELINE: Huntington, W.Va. 

 BODY:
 FROM Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush, the Republican Party has assiduously courted the core of the old Roosevelt coalition: poor, white, working-class voters -- mostly rural, often elderly, sometimes sparsely educated and frequently fundamentalist. But in so doing, Republican presidential candidates have shortchanged a vital component of their party: the Eisenhower Republicans. 
 These are the affluent, well-educated, mostly white suburbanites and exurbanites who once dominated Republican politics. Fiscally conservative but socially progressive, they catapulted Wendell Willkie to the Republican nomination in 1940 and then rode to victory on the coattails of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. They believe in rule of law at home and collective security abroad, and they cringe at the mantra that Washington is the problem, not the solution. 
 Eisenhower has been ignored by Republican power brokers for the past 40 years. Yet with the exception of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eisenhower was the most successful president of the 20th century. He ended a no-win war with Korea with honor and dignity, resisted calls for preventive war with China and the Soviet Union and weaned the Republican Party from its isolationist past. 
 The supreme commander of Allied forces during World War II, Eisenhower believed the United States should not go to war unless the nation's survival was at stake. ''There is no alternative to peace,'' he said. He refused to engage American troops in brush-fire wars for political abstractions. After Eisenhower made peace in Korea, not a single American died in combat for the rest of his presidency. 
 When the National Security Council recommended the use of nuclear weapons at Dien Bien Phu to rescue the beleaguered French garrison there, Eisenhower rejected the proposal. ''We can't use those awful things against Asians for the second time in less than 10 years,'' he said. Four years later, when China threatened force against Taiwan, the joint chiefs again recommended a nuclear response, and once again, Eisenhower rejected the idea.
 On the home front, Eisenhower tamed the inflation that the Korean War aroused, slashed military spending, balanced the budget and worked easily with a Democratic Congress. Two of his appointees to the Supreme Court, Earl Warren and William Brennan, started a judicial revolution. (Eisenhower was disappointed with some of the decisions of the Warren court, but the advances that Americans experienced in civil liberty and social justice during the past 50 years are in very large measure attributable to Warren and Brennan.)
 Eisenhower held a limited view of presidential power. He felt that Congress made policy and the president carried it out. He took his constitutional responsibility to ''take care that the laws be faithfully executed'' at face value. In 1957, when a federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., ordered the desegregation of Central High School, Eisenhower dispatched the 101st Airborne Division to enforce the court's order. ''Sending in the troops was the hardest decision I had to make since D-Day,'' Eisenhower later said, but ''it was the only thing I could do.''
 Eisenhower believed traditional American values encompassed change and progress. ''Should any political party attempt to abolish Social Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear from that party again,'' he wrote his brother Edgar. ''There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things,'' he continued, but he added, ''Their number is negligible and they are stupid.'' 
 He also believed that government had a positive role to play in American life. The Interstate highway program revolutionized the nation's transportation system, and the St. Lawrence Seaway opened the Great Lakes to ocean traffic. The Defense Education Act, which broke the longstanding taboo against direct federal aid to education when Eisenhower signed it into law in 1958, has done more to change the face of American universities than any other measure since the enactment of the G.I. Bill during World War II.
 Eisenhower gave the country eight years of prosperity and peace. No other 20th-century president can make that claim.
 His presidency reflected the views of the moderate Republicans who once set the party's agenda. Winning the votes of these Republicans -- who on many issues differ little from this century's Democratic mainstream -- should be the first order of business for Barack Obama's campaign.
 Mr. Obama is already reaching out to evangelical Christians, a key bloc of the Reagan coalition. Reaching out more explicitly to the Eisenhower Republicans who never felt part of that coalition would be a logical next step.

HEADLINE: Bush, Preparing for Talks, Defends Going to Olympics

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: TOYAKO, Japan 

 BODY:
President Bush arrived on the mountainous northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on Sunday to talk to world leaders about climate change, soaring oil and gas prices and aid to Africa. But first he defended his decision to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing next month -- and he got a little help from his host, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, who announced he would go, too.
 ''I view the Olympics as an opportunity for me to cheer on our athletes,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference after the two leaders met privately. He said not going to the ceremony ''would be an affront to the Chinese people'' that might make it ''more difficult to be able to speak frankly with the Chinese leadership.'' 
 Human rights advocates have been urging a boycott of the Games to protest China's crackdown on antigovernment protests in Tibet and its support of the government in Sudan. 
 Other world leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, are skipping the opening ceremonies. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has said he may stay home as well, although French news reports said over the weekend that he was about to announce that he would attend. 
 But Mr. Fukuda said, ''I don't think you have to really link Olympics with politics.''
 Mr. Bush's visit to the scenic hot springs resort at Toyako, where the leaders are gathered, is his last meeting as president with the leaders of the other Group of 8 industrialized nations. It comes as other nations are frustrated with the United States over the weak dollar and rising oil and food prices, which are threatening the global economy.
 On Monday, when the session officially began, Mr. Bush met with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia for more than an hour. Afterward they said they agreed on the need for North Korea and Iran to abandon their nuclear ambitions, but they did not bridge their differences over Mr. Bush's plan to build a missile defense system in eastern Europe. 
 It was their first meeting since Mr. Medvedev succeeded Vladimir V. Putin in May. 
 Mr. Bush said, ''I found him to be a smart guy who understands the issues very well.'' Later he added, ''I'm not going to sit here and psychoanalyze him, but I will tell you that he's very comfortable, he's confident, and when he tells you something he means it.''
 Asked by a reporter what the two men could accomplish together, given the short period of time left in his term and the brief period Mr. Medvedev has been in office, Mr. Bush said, ''I reminded him that I'm leaving, but not until six months, and I'm sprinting to the finish.''
 Mr. Medvedev said he was confident that he would ''build on the relationship with the new American administration but we still have six months with the effective administration, and we will try to intensify our dialogue with this administration.''
 Mr. Bush hopes to use his time here to press his fellow leaders to live up to their promises of more aid to Africa, a centerpiece of his own foreign policy agenda.
 Climate change is another major topic; after years of pressure to confront the problem of global warming more aggressively, Mr. Bush is now hoping to lead the way to an international agreement by the end of this year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 But Mr. Bush's efforts, particularly on climate change, are complicated by the presidential election back home. Both Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, have criticized the White House over what they regard as a lack of commitment to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.
 ''Everyone's sort of waiting for the next U.S. president,'' said Alden Meyer, who is here monitoring the talks as director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group based in Washington. ''Either way, you're going to see a very different approach than President Bush.''
 Mr. Fukuda has said he would like to conclude the meeting with an agreement to cut heat-trapping gases by 50 percent by 2050. But Mr. Bush has long resisted such a mandatory target unless developing nations like China and India sign on. 
 Before leaving for last year's Group of 8 meeting in Germany, Mr. Bush proposed his own solution: a series of meetings among high-polluting nations to try to forge an international consensus. The leaders of those countries, which include China and India, are scheduled to meet on Hokkaido on Wednesday, and a major question among summit meeting participants is what will come out of that session.
 One expert monitoring the talks here, Philip E. Clapp of the Pew Environment Group, said negotiators were considering a proposal put forth by China. In it, China would agree to a long-range target for reducing emissions by 2050 in exchange for a commitment from the United States to set a ''solid, aggressive target'' for reducing its emissions in a shorter time frame, by 2020. 
 In April, Mr. Bush called for the United States to stop the growth of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, and Mr. Clapp said he remained hopeful that a deal could be worked out.
 But at Sunday's news conference, Mr. Bush was noncommittal, saying only that the United States was working to come up with a ''constructive statement.''
 Mr. Bush also used the news conference to assuage Japanese concerns about his recent decision to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism -- a move that has touched a raw nerve here because of the unresolved issue of North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens decades ago. Mr. Bush took the step after the North's long-delayed declaration of its nuclear program to the outside world.
 But the fate of the abductees, who disappeared in the 1970s and 1980s apparently as part of an effort by the North to train Japanese-speaking spies, is a very emotional issue, and Japan has been using its role in the so-called six-party talks with North Korea to press for the abductees' return. 
 The big fear here is that Japan will lose its leverage now that the United States has removed the North from the list of sponsors of terrorism.
 So Mr. Bush, saying he was ''aware of the sensitivity,'' made Mr. Fukuda a promise. ''The United States will not abandon you on this issue,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Quietly, Brazil Eclipses an Ally

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Simon Romero reported from Caracas, and Alexei Barrionuevo from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil clasped hands here at a summit meeting late last month, as employees of Venezuela's state oil company raised their fists and shouted Cuban-inspired socialist slogans before the cameras. 
 It was an image of solidarity that might once have alarmed Washington, which has seen the United States' standing steadily eroded by a shift toward left-leaning, populist leaders across the region in the last decade.
 But the carefully orchestrated event disguised a more recent turn in Latin America that presents new opportunities for the United States: Mr. da Silva has steadily peeled himself away from Venezuela's leader and quietly supplanted him as he nurtures Brazil into a regional powerhouse. 
 Today the two leaders, often partners but sometimes rivals, offer starkly different paths toward development, and it is Brazil's milder and more pragmatic approach that appears ascendant. Amid the decline of American influence in the region, the Brazilian president is discreetly outflanking Mr. Chavez at almost every turn in the struggle for leadership in South America. 
 Mr. Chavez has been nationalizing foreign companies and trying to assemble an anti-American bloc of nations. His regional credentials suffered last week, though, when his ideological rival, President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia, organized a dramatic rescue of 15 hostages held in the jungle by Colombian rebels.
 Mr. da Silva has diversified Brazil's already strong industrial base and created an ample political coalition with almost a dozen neighbors. Huge recent oil discoveries in Brazilian waters have allowed him to blunt Venezuela's efforts to use its oil largess to win influence. Venezuela's economy has shown signs of stumbling, while its dependence on trade with Brazil has intensified. 
 The key to Brazil's success has been a lucky confluence of global economic trends, like rising demand for commodities like soybeans and sugar-based ethanol, but also the quiet stewardship of Mr. da Silva, a former auto plant worker. He has raised Brazil's profile across the region in part by adopting a less confrontational approach to Mr. Chavez than that of the United States.
 Instead of publicly squaring off with Mr. Chavez, even when he has threatened Brazilian interests, Mr. da Silva taps into the kinship of the left and lavishes praise on him. Mr. da Silva went so far as to describe Mr. Chavez recently in the German magazine Der Spiegel as Venezuela's ''best president in a century.''
 ''The pragmatic side of Lula, the union leader who was always a negotiator, has paid off,'' said Kenneth Maxwell, a historian at Harvard University and a columnist for the Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo. 
 ''While Chavez grabs the headlines, the debate over whether Brazil is becoming a regional power is moot,'' he said. ''Brazil has actually made it to that level, but in a very nonbombastic way.'' 
 While high oil prices have bolstered the theatricality of Mr. Chavez's maverick policies, Venezuela's most pervasive influence remains limited to a handful of the region's poorest nations -- Bolivia, Cuba, Dominica and Nicaragua -- members of ALBA, a trade alliance championed by Mr. Chavez. Another Chavez ally, Ecuador, is not a member. Meanwhile, Mr. da Silva's unexpected embrace of the market-friendly ideas begun by his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has emphasized how heterogeneous political thinking has become in Latin America, even on the left. 
 Publicly, the Brazilian president has been quick to defend Mr. Chavez, even as privately he has sought to temper the Venezuelan president's sometimes inflammatory remarks. 
 In an interview in September, Mr. da Silva said that the rhetoric ''worked with the reality of Venezuelan politics'' and that Mr. Chavez's anti-Americanism was rooted in the Venezuelan leader's unshakable belief that the Bush administration was behind a 2002 coup attempt. ''He has his reasons,'' Mr. da Silva said. 
 But while Mr. Chavez turned harder to the left after his brief ouster in 2002, Mr. da Silva shifted to the center once in power, surprising many skeptics. His lighter touch has greased the way for Brazil in countries as varied as Cuba, the Socialist bastion to which Venezuela provides a lifeline of subsidized oil, and Colombia, a top United States military ally whose relations with Venezuela have been frosty in recent months. 
 In June, Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, declared during a visit to Havana that Brazil wanted to extend credits for Cuba to import Brazilian agricultural products in hope of surpassing Venezuela as Cuba's top partner. 
 In Colombia, Brazilian investors recently took control of Avianca, Colombia's largest airline. And Colombian authorities drew inspiration from Petrobras, the state-controlled Brazilian energy giant, in retooling their own state oil company to expose it more to market forces. 
 Venezuela itself has grown more economically dependent on Brazil. Last month Brazilian agribusiness concerns forged deals to export more food to Venezuela, exploiting the persistent shortages in Venezuela's economy caused by mismanagement and price controls. 
 Brazilian companies have won contracts for projects in Venezuela like expanding the Caracas metro system and building a bridge over the Orinoco River. Recently Brazil surpassed Colombia to become Venezuela's largest trading partner after the United States. 
 In some countries where Venezuela and Brazil have emerged as rivals, like Bolivia, Mr. Chavez still has the upper hand. Bolivia, Brazil's chief natural gas supplier, shocked Brazil in 2006 by nationalizing the energy industry, with Venezuela's help. Last December, Mr. da Silva tried to enhance Brazil's stature in Bolivia, South America's poorest country, by extending a $600 million credit line for infrastructure projects there. 
 Meanwhile, Brazil's trade surplus with the 11 other countries forming the Latin American Integration Association climbed to $16 billion in 2007 from $1.7 billion in 2002, with these nations buying about a quarter of everything Brazil sold abroad. 
 Venezuela's attempts to assemble an alliance of countries remains limited to its ALBA trade bloc. But Brazil hosted leaders of 12 South American nations in May to create Unasur, a continental bloc modeled on the European Union that unites the region's two main trading groups, Mercosur and the Andean Community. 
 Brazil has often publicly lauded Mr. Chavez's efforts to unify South America, while subtly strengthening institutions that serve as a check on ambitious Venezuelan-backed ventures, like a gas pipeline across the continent or the Bank of the South, a development bank conceived to compete with the World Bank. 
 The Bank of the South remains little more than a grandiose idea. Last December, just nine days after Mr. Chavez announced the formation of the bank, which Brazil is expected to join, Mr. da Silva attended a low-key event in Uruguay to inaugurate a new branch of Brazil's development bank, B.N.D.E.S. 
 The Bank of the South would be hard-pressed to catch up to B.N.D.E.S., which financed $4.2 billion worth of investments worldwide last year, including loans for the expansion of the Caracas metro. 
 Brazil's energy discoveries have also challenged Venezuela's power. Mr. Chavez seemed particularly shaken last November by new estimates of the magnitude of an oil field off Brazil's southeastern coast, known as the Tupi field, gently chiding Mr. da Silva for becoming an ''oil baron.''
 Today Brazil sits on the threshold of joining the global oil powers, and the Tupi find led Mr. da Silva to announce plans to join the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in a few years. Venezuela has long been Latin America's main representative there.
 Petrobras is setting production records, drilling for oil in Africa and the United States, as well as Brazil. Venezuela's national oil company, on the other hand, has been stymied by stagnant production since Mr. Chavez gutted the company of executives he considered to be disloyal several years ago. 
 While some announcements point to greater cooperation between the two countries, like an agreement last month to consider shipping liquid natural gas from Venezuela to Brazil, they also underscore Brazil's ability to thwart politicized projects, like Mr. Chavez's plan for a 5,000-mile pipeline. 
 ''Nobody knows if gas cargoes from Venezuela will ever reach Brazil when the Brazilians can get gas from more reliable sources like Trinidad,'' said Pietro Pitts, an oil analyst here who publishes the magazine LatinPetroleum. ''Brazil tactfully put another nail into the coffin of Chavez's pipeline plan.''
 In the security realm, Mr. Chavez was upstaged on Wednesday when the Colombian military executed an elaborate rescue of 15 hostages, among them three American military contractors and Ingrid Betancourt, a former Colombian presidential candidate who was considered a key bargaining chip for the rebel group known as FARC. 
 The Venezuelan leader has successfully negotiated with the FARC for the release of six hostages since January. But his own ties with the group have come under such scrutiny that he has found himself calling for the FARC to give up its armed struggle.
 Mr. da Silva seemed to steal the spotlight from Mr. Chavez in March when Brazil proposed a South American defense council that would serve as a southern version of NATO. Mr. Chavez hailed the effort, though his own efforts in 1999 to create such an alliance fell on deaf ears. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed support for the idea during a recent swing through Brazil, saying she trusted the Brazilian leadership to carry out the project. Brazil also leads the main United Nations peacekeeping mission in the region, in Haiti, where it has 1,200 soldiers.
 Despite all of Brazil's accomplishments in surging ahead of Venezuela in Latin America, Mr. da Silva has eschewed being labeled a leader in the region. ''We are not trying to find a leader in Latin America,'' he said in the September interview. ''We don't need a leader. I am not worried about being the leader of anything. What I want is to govern my country well.''

HEADLINE: Behind The Bush Bust

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
By huge margins, Americans think the economy is in lousy shape -- and they blame President Bush. This fact, more than anything else, makes it hard to see how the Democrats can lose this election. 
 But is the public right to be so disgusted with Mr. Bush's economic leadership? Not exactly. We really do have a lousy economy, a fact of which Mr. Bush seems spectacularly unaware. But that's not the same thing as saying that the bad economy is Mr. Bush's fault. 
 On the other hand, there's a certain rough justice in the public's attitude. Other politicians besides Mr. Bush share the blame for the mess we're in -- but most of them are Republicans. 
 First things first: pay no attention to apologists who try to defend the Bush economic record. Since 2001, economic conditions have alternated between so-so and outright bad: a recession, followed by one of the weakest expansions since World War II, and then by a renewed job slump that isn't officially a recession yet, but certainly feels like one. 
 Over all, Mr. Bush will be lucky to leave office with a net gain of five million jobs, far short of the number needed to keep up with population growth. For comparison, Bill Clinton presided over an economy that added 22 million jobs.
 And what does Mr. Bush have to say about this dismal record? ''I think when people take a look back at this moment in our economic history, they'll recognize tax cuts work.'' Clueless to the end.
 Yet even liberal economists have a hard time arguing that Mr. Bush's cluelessness actually caused the poor economic performance on his watch. Tax cuts didn't work, but they didn't create the Bush bust. So what did? 
 At the top of my list of causes for the lousy economy are three factors: the housing bubble and its aftermath, rising health care costs and soaring raw materials prices. I've written a lot about housing, so today let's talk about the others.
 Most public discussion of health care focuses on the problems of the uninsured and underinsured. But insurance premiums are also a major business expense: auto makers famously spend more on health care than they do on steel.
 One of the underemphasized keys to the Clinton boom, I'd argue, was the way the cost disease of health care went into remission between 1993 and 2000. For a while, the spread of managed care put a lid on premiums, encouraging companies to expand their work forces.
 But premiums surged again after 2000, imposing huge new burdens on business. It's a good bet that this played an important role in weak job creation.
 What about raw materials prices? During the Clinton years basic commodities stayed cheap by historical standards. Since then, however, food and energy prices have exploded, directly lopping about 5 percent off the typical American family's real income, and raising business costs throughout the economy.
 Much of this pain could have been avoided.
 If Bill Clinton's attempt to reform health care had succeeded, the U.S. economy would be in much better shape today. But the attempt failed -- and let's remember why. Yes, the Clinton administration botched the politics. But it was Republicans in Congress who blocked reform, as Newt Gingrich pursued a strategy of ''coagulation'' designed to ''clot everyone away'' from Mr. Clinton.
 As for high food and fuel prices, they're mainly the result of growing demand from China and other emerging economies. But oil prices wouldn't be as high as they are, and the United States would have been much less vulnerable to the current price spike, if we had taken steps in the past to limit our oil consumption.
 Mr. Bush certainly deserves some blame here, and not just for his destructive embrace of ethanol as the answer to our energy problems. After 9/11 he could easily have called for higher gas taxes and fuel efficiency standards as a national security measure, but the thought never seems to have crossed his mind. 
 Still, in energy as in health care the biggest missed opportunities came 15 or more years ago, when Mr. Gingrich and other conservative Republicans in Congress, aided by Democrats with ties to energy-intensive industries, blocked conservation measures. 
 So here's the bottom line: Mr. Bush deserves some blame for the poor performance of the economy on his watch, but much of the blame lies with other, earlier political figures, who squandered chances for reform. As it happens, however, most though not all of the politicians responsible for our current economic difficulties were Republicans.
 And bear in mind that John McCain has gone to great lengths to affirm his support for Republican economic orthodoxy. So he'll have no reason to complain if, as seems likely, the economy costs him the election.

HEADLINE: Economy's Move to the Fore Poses Problems for Both Candidates

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY. 
Dan Barry's column, ''This Land,'' will return on July 21.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Not since at least 1980, when the United States was reeling from the oil shocks, inflation and slow growth of the previous decade, has the economy been in worse shape heading into the heart of a presidential campaign. The crush of bad economic news -- six consecutive months of job losses, rising rates of home foreclosures, gasoline prices seemingly headed toward $5 a gallon -- is increasingly setting the contours of the race between Senators Barack Obama and John McCain.
 Both candidates plan to spend this week focusing almost entirely on the economy. But both face political problems with the issue. 
 Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, has been shadowed by his statements earlier in the campaign that he is not expert in the subject of the economy and by the likelihood that voters will associate him with the economic policies of the Bush administration. He has embraced President Bush's stands on central issues like tax cuts and trade policy. 
 Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois, has had difficulty connecting with working-class voters, and his more ambitious responses to economic problems like expanding access to health insurance would be paid for in part by tax increases, always a risky proposition.
 The two campaigns are retooling strategies and preparing for what aides said would be months of economic speeches, town-hall-style meetings on the economy and economic proposals, both new and repackaged -- testimony to how the campaigns view the electoral environment.
 ''We are going to spend the rest of the summer talking about jobs, energy and health care,'' said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. He said Mr. McCain would prefer that the campaign focus on national security, given his credentials in that area, ''but that's just not the way the world works.''
 It appears likely that activity on both sides will involve appearances notable more for their political symbolism -- and attacks against the other side -- than any attempt to come up with ideas for dealing with the problems. Mr. McCain will probably continue to attack Mr. Obama for supporting tax increases, and Mr. Obama is likely to portray Mr. McCain's views as an extension of Mr. Bush's economic policies.
 Mr. McCain is set to announce on Monday morning that 300 economists are endorsing his economic proposals, which include tax cuts, expanded trade and a pledge to veto bills with earmarks. His aides said the endorsements, mostly by conservative economists, would help him establish his credentials in this area. Mr. McCain will spend the week talking about job creation in hard-pressed battleground states, a contrast with his decision to spend last week in Latin America, a move that even some of his allies said risked having him seem unconcerned with the problems at home.
 Mr. McCain's aides said he would talk this week with voters, often in intimate settings, about their economic problems, in the hope of coming off as more empathetic than Mr. Obama. He will attack Mr. Obama over his support for raising taxes and his opposition to lifting the ban on offshore oil drilling and suspending the gasoline tax for the summer, positions also highlighted in an advertisement by the Republican National Committee that began being shown on Sunday in closely contested states. 
 Mr. McCain will also renew his attempt to draw contrasts with Mr. Obama on trade by focusing on Mr. Obama's opposition to some trade deals that Mr. McCain said would help the economy, as he did in Colombia last week.
 Mr. McCain has repeatedly argued that raising taxes in a weak economy would have disastrous consequences and asserted that his plan for long-term tax cuts -- the centerpiece of his economic program -- would solve the short-term economic problems.
 But, Mr. McCain's aides said, he will not offer any significant new economic programs or ideas. Mr. Black said the campaign was counting more on the contrast with Mr. Obama on tax cuts than on Mr. Obama's problems relating to working-class voters.
 Mr. Obama has filled his schedule with relatively intimate appearances in which he will talk to voters about the souring economy and how it affects them. Winning the support of working-class voters is a major test for Mr. Obama heading into the fall, especially in swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.
 Since the spring, Mr. Obama has been speaking much more specifically about the economy and how his plan would address the problems -- mentioning, for example, his proposal for a fund to help avoid mortgage foreclosures -- as he has moved away from urging more government regulation of lenders. He has called for two more rounds of economic stimulus packages, in the form of rebate checks, to help the economy and consumers deal with rising gasoline prices, and his campaign criticized Mr. McCain on Sunday for refusing to support such measures.
 A bad turn in the Iraq war or another terrorist attack could change the calculus of this election. Mr. Obama is planning to spend a week on a trip that will take him to Afghanistan and Iraq, a signal that elections are not either-or propositions. Still, both campaigns agree that for the first time since 1992, the election is likely to focus mostly on the economy.
 ''The economy is going to be a driving force throughout this campaign,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist.
 In what is perhaps an unwelcome turn of events for Mr. McCain, the Iraq war has faded in the news as the country has seemed to quiet down -- arguably providing a validation of his call to increase troop strength there, which Mr. Obama opposed -- putting even more emphasis on an issue that Mr. McCain would prefer be secondary. 
 ''I don't think candidates are going to be able to get away without addressing the economy in a systematic, daily basis,'' said Matthew Dowd, the chief strategist for Mr. Bush's campaign in 2004. ''They have to do two things: they have to demonstrate that they have an understanding of where people are in their lives -- have some empathy for the anxiety that is created. And secondly, do they have a prescription for the problems?''
 ''I'm not surprised that Senator McCain is coming back from his South American trip -- which I still don't understand -- and is going to do an economic tour,'' Mr. Dowd said.

HEADLINE: Obama's Organizing Years, Guiding Others and Finding Himself

BYLINE: By SERGE KOVALESKI

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
The year was 1985 and Gerald Kellman, a community organizer, was interviewing an applicant named Barack Obama to work in the demoralized landscape of poor neighborhoods on this city's South Side. He liked the young man's intelligence, motivation and acutely personal understanding of how it felt to be an outsider. He also remembers that Mr. Obama drove a hard bargain.
 ''He challenged me on whether we could teach him anything,'' Mr. Kellman recalled. ''He wanted to know things like 'How are you going to train me?' and 'What am I going to learn?' ''
 Mr. Obama's three-year stretch as a grass-roots organizer has figured prominently, if not profoundly, in his own narrative of his life. Campaigning in Iowa, Mr. Obama called it ''the best education I ever had, better than anything I got at Harvard Law School,'' an education that he said was ''seared into my brain.'' He devoted about one-third of the 442 pages in his memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' to chronicling that Chicago organizing period. 
 In recent days, Mr. Obama has imbued those years with even greater significance, invoking them last week as inspiration for his plan to deliver social services through religious organizations. He told a conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church on Saturday that as a community organizer he ''let Jesus Christ into my life'' and ''I dedicated myself to discovering his truth and carrying out his works.''
 It is clear that the benefit of those years to Mr. Obama dwarfs what he accomplished. Mr. Kellman said that Mr. Obama had built the organization's following among needy residents and black ministers, but ''on issues, we made very little progress, nothing that would change poverty on the South Side of Chicago.''
 When he ran for the Senate in 2004, Mr. Obama told members of the community organization that had employed him that ''when I left to go to law school, I couldn't tell exactly whether I had gotten more out of this than the people I was working with.''
 During that time, Mr. Obama found a home at the center of the country after spending most of his first 23 years in Hawaii and Indonesia. He also both lived and worked extensively for the first time in an African-American community. At a very local level he learned to bring people together around causes and to mobilize them with his words.
 ''I got the distinct impression that he was selling something he believed in, and I was going to buy it,'' said the Rev. Samuel Strachan, a minister Mr. Obama brought into his organization.
 For Mr. Obama, who had been drawn to Chicago by the recent election of Harold Washington as the city's first black mayor, perhaps the greatest benefit of his time on the streets of the South Side was coming to terms with his place in black America.
 ''All of a sudden Barack finds himself in one of the most complex African-American communities in the United States and he discovers an energizing capacity to connect with the people in these neighborhoods,'' said Gregory Galluzzo, a community organizer who worked with Mr. Obama.
 ''He is experiencing blackness in Chicago on both sides of the spectrum, from residents of public housing to Harold Washington,'' Mr. Galluzzo added. ''His identification with these people begins his political journey.''
 A Unique Life
 Before graduating from Columbia University in 1983, Mr. Obama had written to civil rights organizations and to black elected officials looking for work. No one wrote back.
 He worked brief stints at two different jobs, but unemployed two years later, Mr. Obama answered an advertisement for a Chicago grass-roots organizer. With the devastating demise of the steel industry, Mr. Kellman was trying to work with blacks in the city and whites in the suburbs to salvage manufacturing jobs. Mr. Kellman, who is white, was looking for a black organizer to assist him.
 Mr. Kellman said that based on the resume, he had not been sure Mr. Obama was black. The name Obama and the fact that he had grown up in Hawaii, made him think Mr. Obama might be Japanese.
 In fact, Mr. Obama, the son of a black father and white mother, was on a search for racial identity. In his memoir, Mr. Obama reflected on the grainy, black-and-white images of the civil rights struggles that his mother showed him when he was a boy and how they reminded him ''that I wasn't alone in my particular struggles.''
 He wrote that membership in the black community had to be earned ''through organizing, through shared sacrifice,'' adding, ''I believed that it might, over time, admit the uniqueness of my own life.''
 At their first meeting, Mr. Kellman had some concerns about whether Mr. Obama had the stamina for such grueling, frustrating work. ''Barack looked good, but would he burn out?'' he said.
 Still, Mr. Kellman was impressed, believing that Mr. Obama's background had taught him about being an outsider. ''These kinds of experiences help people relate to others who are outsiders of the system,'' Mr. Kellman said. ''On a compassion level, this is important.''
 Mr. Kellman offered him the job on the spot. And Mr. Obama accepted, for a starting salary of $10,000 a year, plus $2,000 to buy a car.
 Avoiding Confrontations
 Loretta Augustine-Herron recalled sitting at her kitchen table with Mr. Obama for several hours one afternoon at her home near a housing project.
 ''He was not in a hurry, and I told him about what I did working with Girl Scouts and volunteering at school as a room mother and for block clubs in the neighborhood,'' she said. ''He wanted to know what made me tick, what my goals were and how things impacted the stability of my family.''
 Ms. Augustine-Herron said that long afterward, Mr. Obama recalled details of their talk, like her oldest daughter's service in the Air Force.
 The small organization Mr. Obama worked for, the Developing Communities Project, was influenced by the thinking of Saul Alinsky, a Chicago native regarded as the father of community organizing. Mr. Alinsky viewed self-interest as the main motivation for political participation.
 Mr. Obama saw it more broadly. ''In his view, figuring out who you are and then getting that person to think about what he or she is going to do with it is the first step toward empowerment,'' Daniel Lee, a fellow organizer, recalled. ''He told me this was an extension of his own journey in struggling to find his identity.''
 Mr. Obama shunned Mr. Alinsky's strategy of using confrontation tactics like pressuring public officials and business leaders by picketing their homes.
 ''I think it was strategic that he would not have fallouts with people he disagreed with because he realized that he had to work with them not just on one particular issue, but on other issues down the road,'' Mr. Kellman said.
 Mr. Obama did adhere to the Alinsky principle of meticulously planning for meetings with people in power. The roles of the residents were scripted and the organizer was a quiet, inconspicuous presence.
 One of the larger meetings Mr. Obama helped set up was at a church where about 600 people turned out to talk with officials about water contamination. He stood in the back holding a clipboard that had a diagram with the names and talking points for each of the residents. He also had arranged backups in case someone became too nervous to speak.
 ''People are asking Barack for instructions and he is giving them their roles and giving encouragement to people who had cold feet,'' recalledHarold Lucas, who was a fellow organizer.
 Afterward, Mr. Obama held an evaluation session with 20 or so residents, and one tenant led them in prayer.
 Mr. Obama faced skepticism from Baptist and Pentecostal pastors unwilling to use their influence to help him organize their members. His group had consisted almost entirely of Catholic churches, and its top officials were white and Jewish.
 ''Barack had to get beyond the accusation that he was working for Catholics and Jews who were trying to make money off the community,'' Mr. Kellman said.
 Mr. Obama wrote that a minister suggested it would be helpful if he belonged to a church, and he joined the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.'s congregation after hearing a sermon about faith's power to inspire underdogs. Mr. Wright's sermons have been an issue in the campaign.
 In his paramount achievement, Mr. Obama persuaded a number of these pastors to enlist their churches as members of the Developing Communities Project. Fortunately for Mr. Obama, a new wave of younger pastors was replacing the older guard.
 ''He was interested in finding out what I thought could be done in the community about issues like public safety and employment, rather than giving me some long-winded spiel,'' said the Rev. Alvin Love, the pastor of Lilydale First Baptist Church. ''We were looking for ways to get involved, and Barack gave us a mechanism to do that.''
 Mr. Obama asked him to attend a meeting with other ministers. ''Fifteen churches were represented there, and we started making plans to mobilize around issues like drugs, violence and job training,'' Mr. Love said.
 Wrangling Over Asbestos
 In a stirring scene from his memoir, Mr. Obama describes an organizing success at Altgeld Gardens, a badly neglected housing project.
 Mr. Obama wrote that one day an Altgeld parent handed him a newspaper advertisement soliciting bids to remove asbestos from Altgeld's management office.
 Mr. Obama recounted that he helped arrange a bus trip to the housing authority headquarters where residents had demanded a meeting with the executive director and a pledge that residential units would be tested for asbestos. As television cameras rolled, the residents were promised testing and a meeting.
 ''I changed as a result of that bus trip, in a fundamental way,'' Mr. Obama wrote. It was the kind of action that ''hints at what might be possible and therefore spurs you on.''
 What Mr. Obama does not mention in his book is that residents of the nearby Ida B. Wells housing project, and some at Altgeld itself, had already been challenging the housing authority on asbestos. A local newspaper had also taken up the issue.
 ''Barack based the Altgeld campaign on the Wells model,'' Mike Kruglik, an organizer who helped train Mr. Obama in Chicago, remembered. ''He said, 'Why can't we do this at Altgeld?' ''
 Around the same time, The Chicago Reporter, aided by a community organizer named Linda Randle, published an article about asbestos problems at Wells.
 In an interview, Ms. Randle said that she and Mr. Obama had formed a coalition to deal with asbestos.
 ''It was not one person that made the difference,'' Ms. Randle said. ''It was everyone coming together.''
 Hazel Johnson, an environmental activist at Altgeld, said that she started to raise the asbestos issue with the housing authority in 1979, but that it had failed to act. Ms. Johnson and Ms. Randle pointed out that only some of the asbestos was removed from pipes at Altgeld, but not until 1989, a year after Mr. Obama left for Harvard. (An Obama campaign spokesman, Ben LaBolt, said, ''The book is meant to be an autobiography about Obama's experiences, not a history of social and environmental activism in Chicago.'')
 Meanwhile, the residents' meeting with the housing authority's executive director was a debacle, an illustration of the setbacks faced by Mr. Obama and other organizers.
 The crowd of about 700 residents grew irritable in the stifling heat and booed the director when he arrived an hour and 15 minutes late, according to people who were there, as well as newspaper accounts.
 The meeting became even more raucous after the director indicated that the agency still did not have a plan to remove the asbestos. The director abruptly left 15 minutes into the meeting after a resident wrestled with him for the microphone. Angry tenants followed him out the door, chanting, ''No more rent!''
 Later that night, Mr. Obama called Johnnie Owens, whom he would hire as a community organizer. Never had Mr. Obama sounded so downcast or frustrated, Mr. Owens said.
 ''Barack basically talked about how tough it was to generate real results through organizing and that it was embarrassing to him to have the residents out of control,'' he recounted.
 ''He wondered if he had done a good enough job preparing them for the meeting,'' Mr. Owens said. ''He sounded angry at himself. He was questioning the whole methodology.'' 
 Mr. Obama had risen to executive director of the Developing Communities group, but the demanding hours, small victories and low pay took a toll on him, and he decided to leave.
 '' 'We are not making large-scale change, and I want to be involved in doing that,' '' Mr. Kellman said Mr. Obama had told him.
 Mr. Kellman said Mr. Obama spent his final months in Chicago making sure the organization had enough money, staff members and church members to survive after he left.
 Mr. Obama had mused to friends in Chicago about one day working for unions or becoming a preacher, a journalist or even a fiction writer. While there, he wrote short stories based on people he had encountered. ''The stories were beautifully crafted and evocative,'' said Mr. Kruglik.
 But Mr. Obama decided on law school instead. Shortly before Mr. Obama left for Harvard, about 60 people attended a farewell reception for him at Altgeld Gardens. He told associates that he intended to return to Chicago once he earned his law degree to pursue a career ''in public life.''

HEADLINE: Google, Zen Master Of The Market

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Bill Gates, who walked away from full-time work at Microsoft last month, was perhaps the foremost applied economist of the second half of the 20th century. 
 Mr. Gates and Microsoft fundamentally shaped how people think about the behavior of modern markets in which technology plays a central role. Under Mr. Gates, Microsoft also challenged the conventional wisdom about competition, business strategy and even antitrust law. 
 Now, in the early years of the 21st century, Google is the company prompting a rethinking of assumptions.
 Microsoft was a master practitioner of ''network effects,'' the straightforward precept in economics that the value of a product or service often goes up as more people use it. There is nothing new about the concept. It was true of railways, telephones and fax machines, for example. 
 Microsoft, however, applied the power of network effects more lucratively than any company had done before it. 
 Microsoft attracted consumers and software developers to use its technology, the software that controls the basic operations of a personal computer. The more that people used Microsoft's operating system (DOS and later Windows), the more that third-party developers built products to run on Windows, which attracted more users. 
 So Microsoft's success snowballed, and the company owned the essential technology, making it harder for users and developers to switch to alternatives.
 But the Internet has changed the rules of networked competition, partly because Internet software standards are more open than those in the PC industry. That helps explain why Microsoft has struggled to catch up with Google in the rich new market for Internet search advertising.
 Google's huge, widening lead in that business suggests that while some weapons of competition have changed, the market dynamics are similar, say economists and industry experts. At this stage, they note, Internet search appears to be a market that is winner take most, if not all.
 Google, it seems, is the emerging dominant company in the Internet era, much as Microsoft was in the PC era. The study of networked businesses, market competition and antitrust law is being reconsidered in a new context, shaped by Google. Google's explanation for its large share of the Internet search market -- more than 60 percent -- is simply that it is a finely honed learning machine. Its scientists constantly improve the relevance of search results for users and the efficiency of its advertising system for advertisers and publishers.
 ''The source of Google's competitive advantage is learning by doing,'' said Hal R. Varian, Google's chief economist.
 In the Internet marketplace, Mr. Varian notes, users can easily switch to another search engine by typing in another Web address, so there is no tight technology control, as there is with proprietary PC software. Similarly, Mr. Varian says, advertisers and publishers can switch fairly easily to rival ad networks operated by Yahoo, Microsoft and others.
 But economists and analysts point out that Google does indeed have network advantages that present formidable obstacles to rivals. The ''experience effects,'' they say, of users and advertisers familiar with Google's services make them less likely to switch. There is, for example, a sizable cottage industry of experts who tailor Web sites to get higher rankings on search engines, which drive user traffic and thus ad revenues. These experts understandably focus their efforts on the market leader, Google -- another network effect, analysts say.
 Google executives often point out that personal data in its services like Web e-mail is not held in proprietary document formats, as it is in PC software. Formats aside, however, a person with a year or so of e-mail housed in Gmail is highly unlikely to switch as a practical matter, analysts say.
 Taken together, these networked advantages enjoyed by Google are significant, most analysts agree. ''It certainly does have an impact on whether other companies can be competitive threats to Google,'' said Michael Katz, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. ''But it's a very different way to lock people in than it was for Microsoft. It would be a lot easier for people to walk away from Google.''
 Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sees the difference in terms of what he calls ''direct network effects'' and ''indirect network effects.'' The direct effects, he says, include software document formats and technology standards that are owned by one company and that are incompatible with a rival's technology. The indirect effects, he adds, include large numbers of users, the ability to learn from those users, the power of a well-known brand and user inertia.
 ''For Google,'' Mr. Cusumano said, ''the indirect network effects are very powerful.''
 Google's market power, it seems, is the economic equivalent of what in foreign affairs is called ''soft power,'' a term coined by the political scientist Joseph S. Nye Jr. This is the power to co-opt rather than coerce.
 The implications of Google's market power for antitrust law are just beginning to be considered. The Justice Department is reviewing Google's planned partnership with Yahoo. Under the agreement, Yahoo, the No. 2 company in search, would farm out some of its search advertising to Google, the leader. Google has said the deal is simply a voluntary outsourcing arrangement, while opponents say it will reduce competition in search advertising even further.
 Google's market share alone invites scrutiny worldwide. In the United States, antitrust law defines a dominant firm with potentially monopolistic power as a company with 70 percent market share or more. In America, Google has garnered more than 60 percent of searches conducted and about 70 percent of the search ad market. In Europe, the definition of a dominant firm is one that has as little as 35 percent of a market, legal experts say.
 Still, dominance alone is not an antitrust problem. The issue is the powerful company's behavior, says Andrew I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University School of Law. ''You have to be big and bad, not just big,'' he said.
 The telltale signs of a company's bad behavior include raising prices, hindering innovation and excluding competitors. There is no evidence that Google is engaged in suspect behavior, but it could be hard to spot. Its ad auction system, for example, is essentially a private marketplace run by Google, without much disclosure to advertisers or to Web publishers.
 Mr. Varian, Google's chief economist, acknowledges that the company has been criticized for its lack of transparency. But he says that the Google approach is a byproduct of its virtue as a fast-moving learning machine. ''The system is constantly evolving to optimize efficiency, improve ad quality and make the pricing smarter, so you don't want set rules that say we do X and we don't do Y,'' Mr. Varian explained.
 Whether that kind of ''trust us'' explanation will satisfy government regulators, if Google's market power continues to grow, remains to be seen. But Google seems to have learned a lesson from Microsoft and its antitrust troubles. Mr. Varian said antitrust training is mandatory now for Google managers.
 ''Google looks at what happened to Microsoft, and we're going to follow the rules,'' he said. ''If you're really successful, you need to know about antitrust. That goes with the territory.''

HEADLINE: Aims of Democrats Reach Beyond the Oval Office

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Summer is the season of political dreams. And this summer Democrats are dreaming big up and down the ballot. 
 Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee-apparent, has started a broad approach to the general election against the presumed Republican candidate, Senator John McCain. Exploiting his fund-raising edge, Mr. Obama has pledged to run campaigns in all 50 states, many of them well-fortified Republican redoubts. 
 Mr. Obama's initial 18-state advertising campaign underscored the point. It touched improbable targets like Alaska (Republican. victory margin in 2004: 25 percentage points) and North Carolina (Republican margin: 12 percentage points, despite the presence of former Senator John Edwards, a North Carolinian, on the Democratic ticket). 
 Fellow Democrats have embraced Mr. Obama's strategy for reasons beyond the electoral math of the presidential race. In Alaska, North Carolina and several other staunchly Republican states, Democratic candidates for the House and Senate stand to benefit from the Obama campaign's work in registering and turning out voters.
 The Obama strategy ''fits like a glove'' with the party's larger aims, said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Expanded Democratic majorities in turn could give a President Obama a more powerful fist on Capitol Hill.
 Shifts in Congress
 The election calendar alone hands Democrats a big advantage in Senate races. Just 12 seats they now hold are up for re-election this year, while Republicans must defend nearly twice that many.
 By conventional calculations, the triumph of Democrats in 2006 in recapturing the House would suggest a tougher 2008 battle. History has shown that the weakest House winners swept into office in one lopsided election often drift out to sea in the next.
 Yet the political winds that swept Democrats into power on Capitol Hill have gotten stronger. Although voters' anxiety about the Iraq war has receded, their anxiety about the economy has crested, sending President Bush's approval rating to roughly 10 percentage points lower than two years ago.
 The result: the political handicapper Charlie Cook envisions Democratic gains of up to 20 House seats and 7 Senate seats, close to the 60-vote threshold in the Senate needed to break filibusters by the minority. 
 The resources that accompany Mr. Obama's ''expand the battlefield'' strategy augment the robust fund-raising of Democratic House and Senate campaign arms. Even in states Mr. Obama has little chance of carrying, ''we will ask our supporters to focus their energy on registering thousands of new voters and helping increase turnout,'' said Steve Hildebrand, Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager.
 That's good news for Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage, who is challenging Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, and State Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who is challenging another Republican incumbent, Senator Elizabeth Dole. On Monday, Mr. Obama himself returns to North Carolina, where he began an economic-themed campaign swing last month, to discuss ''economic security for America's families'' in Charlotte.
 In states like Mississippi, Democratic strategists anticipate that personal campaigning by Mr. Obama, the first black major party nominee for president, might drive up turnout among white conservatives for Mr. McCain. Mississippi's former Democratic governor, Ronnie Musgrove, is counting on Mr. Obama's campaign workers to maximize black voter turnout in his effort to oust the Republican incumbent, Senator Roger Wicker. The same is true in competitive House races in states like Alabama, Louisiana and Texas.
 Limited Dreams
 Republicans sense the onset of Democratic overconfidence. ''It's a mistake to assume that Obama's money equals a win for the Democratic candidates down ballot,'' said Senator John Ensign of Nevada, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
 Privately, some leading Democrats also fret that hubris could trip up Mr. Obama's team, just as his primary campaign stumbled against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton after victories in February. If Mr. McCain remains within striking distance, the expanded battlefield is likely to shrink to conventional dimensions.
 But those are the hard calculations of the fall homestretch, not the dreams of summer.

HEADLINE: As Bloomberg's Time Wanes, Titans Seek Mayor in His Mold

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Tim Arango contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At charity balls and board meetings, on putting greens and in telephone conversations, New York's corporate titans are on the hunt: Michael R. Bloomberg will end his reign as mayor in 18 months, and they are desperate to find someone from their ranks to take his place.
The executives searching for Mr. Bloomberg's replacement are considered some of New York's most influential business leaders: Martin Lipton, a founding partner of the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; the financier Steven Rattner; and Jerry I. Speyer, chairman of the developer Tishman Speyer.
They have told colleagues that Mr. Bloomberg's financial independence, his lack of party affiliation and his corporate, by-the-numbers approach to management have created a golden age of New York City government that none of his would-be successors seem poised to reproduce, according to people familiar with the conversations. 
''There is significant trepidation over what comes after Bloomberg,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which represents business leaders, and whose board includes Mr. Rattner, Mr. Lipton and Mr. Speyer.
So far, the roster of likely candidates is dominated by traditional Democratic politicians, like City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn and Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who have little or no private-sector experience.
Mr. Rattner and Mr. Speyer are worried enough that they have been pressing Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of Time Warner, to consider running for mayor. So far, Mr. Parsons is not interested.
The executives' courtship of Mr. Parsons shows how much they value a business resume over party affiliation; Mr. Rattner, for example, is a prominent Democratic fund-raiser, but Mr. Parsons is a registered Republican.
Mr. Bloomberg, who founded the financial information giant Bloomberg L.P., appears to be as anxious about his successor as any business leader. At a private dinner in 2006, even he encouraged Mr. Parsons to run for mayor.
Mr. Parsons, a native New Yorker who once worked for Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, would not detail the conversations but said in an interview that ''what the business community wants is not just a businessman but a Bloomberg-type businessman, who is not beholden to special interests.''
Business leaders, of course, have a vested interested in recruiting one of their own, like Mr. Bloomberg, to run for mayor. The Bloomberg administration is considered an ally to many corporations, especially developers. Rezoning projects under his watch have opened large swaths of the city to new construction. And Mr. Bloomberg, especially, travels in the same orbit as many of the city's elite; he goes to their functions and they to his; he gives to their causes and they reciprocate.
But the discussions also highlight a sense, inside and outside the business world, that Mr. Bloomberg has redefined the expectations -- and, some contend, the qualifications -- for the office of the mayor.
In interviews and surveys, New Yorkers broadly express worry that the city may revert to a traditional partisan-infused bureaucracy as they canvass the field of Mr. Bloomberg's would-be successors.
Many in the business world say the city should consider overturning the term-limits law that will force Mr. Bloomberg from office, after eight years, on Dec. 31, 2009. Polls have shown the public overwhelmingly opposed to such a change, despite their fondness for Mr. Bloomberg. But his admirers are not easily giving up.
''I think it is a good thing for us to revisit,'' said William C. Rudin, a real estate executive who is chairman of the Association for a Better New York. ''Two terms for a mayor is too short.''
The developer Donald Trump called the term limits ''a terrible idea, an artificial barrier. Why is he being told he cannot run again?''
Mr. Trump added, ''I have absolutely heard that there would be a positive response -- and a movement -- to keep him in office after this term ends.''
Those attitudes are not going unnoticed by those who are planning to run for mayor. Several are conspicuously trying to tether themselves to Mr. Bloomberg's successes, saying they will maintain his business-minded approach to governance.
John A. Catsimatidis, a billionaire and the colorful owner of the New York supermarket chain Gristedes, said he would use his own money to ensure his independence and run on his Bloomberg-like business credentials.
Like Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Catsimatidis switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican in preparation for a mayoral bid. And he said he would work for $1 if elected, as Mr. Bloomberg does.
Traditional elected leaders, he said, ''have an obligation to corporations, to unions, to special interest groups who give them money.'' He added: ''They are worried about where their next job comes from. But Michael Bloomberg is not worried about where his next job comes, and neither is John Catsimatidis.''
Ms. Quinn has sought to attach herself to the Bloomberg model, working regularly with the mayor on initiatives and appearing alongside him at press conferences, and Mr. Bloomberg has been generous in his praise of her. Other Democrats planning to seek the mayor's job next year are William C. Thompson, the city comptroller, and Tony Avella, a councilman from Queens.
Their resumes are not at all like that of Mr. Bloomberg, who had never held public office before running for mayor in 2001 and campaigned on the strength of his private-sector experience. After being fired from Salomon Brothers, he spotted a need for instant data among Wall Street bankers and traders, and eventually built a multibillion dollar information company around it.
''There is widespread feeling that these people are not up to the job, that they all seem to be too traditional in terms of their biography and orientations,'' said Douglas A. Muzzio, a political scientist at Baruch College. ''They are very old school. They are, to a certain extent, 20th-century politicians.''
Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy was greeted with skepticism, but $75 million from his own pocket and an endorsement from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani helped tip the 2001 election in his favor. From the moment he took office, Mr. Bloomberg has run the city much like a company.
He hired top-flight managers, regardless of party, and judged them on rigid measurements. He took control of the school system and instituted a blunt new A through F rating system that judges schools on performance and on students' progress. He pushed forcefully for a smoking ban, embracing an unpopular political fight that few career politicians would dare to take on.
Under the Bloomberg administration, residents became ''customers'' who could call in rants, requests and inquiries to 311, a new nonemergency hot line. New Yorkers also have access to up-to-the-minute feedback on city services. The city tracks and publicizes how long it takes to fill a pothole (2.7 days), how fast ambulances respond to an emergency (6 minutes 37 seconds, down 17 seconds from 2006) and how long it takes 311 phone operators to answer a call (7 seconds).
In June, a New York Times poll found that 67 percent of city residents approve of the job Mr. Bloomberg is doing. And 10 percent of those surveyed, when asked to volunteer the best thing he has done, cited his handling of city finances and how he treated government like a business.
The financial credentials of the next mayor are likely to become a major issue in the 2009 election now that the city has entered an economic downturn.
Mr. Bloomberg declined to be interviewed for this story, but last month, when asked who might succeed him, he said that ''the most likely candidates would be somebody who works their way up through the Democratic Party because we're an overwhelmingly Democratic town.''
He added: ''If you work your way up, you're not, obviously, going to have executive experience, so we are not likely to have another business person or somebody with executive experience as mayor.''
Of course, Mr. Bloomberg's model as the chief executive-mayor has proved problematic at times. Many attribute Mr. Bloomberg's high-profile failures -- a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan and congestion pricing in Midtown -- to his blunt, my-way-or-the-highway style, which is better suited to the boardroom than, say, the State Assembly.
Even when he wins -- by seizing control of the city's public school system, for instance -- it is often after a long fight.
''There is a business arrogance, and it comes across as paternalistic,'' said Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright of Harlem, who has clashed with the mayor, especially over congestion pricing.
At times, Mr. Wright said, the message ''was that I am the C.E.O., and you aren't.''
And others take issue with the idea that only someone who has a fortune -- and a willingness to use it -- should be mayor.
But even those who find fault with Mr. Bloomberg's style consider him to be a skilled manager who nursed the city back to financial health after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and brought much-needed accountability to many city agencies.
''The next mayor has to show that they can manage the city as well as Mike Bloomberg,'' said Edward F. Ott, the executive director of the New York City Central Labor Council. ''He has certainly upped the ante.''

HEADLINE: Famed Name Is Double-Edged As Two Udalls Run

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
SANTA FE, N.M. -- Representatives Tom and Mark Udall possess one of the most famous political names in the West, one virtually synonymous with protecting the region's spectacular natural resources from overuse and exploitation.
Their fathers, the brothers Stewart L. and Morris K. Udall, used their own federal power more than a generation ago to set aside millions of acres of public land for national parks, wilderness areas and wildlife refuges. The sons embraced the family conservation ethic upon simultaneously winning House seats in 1998 and now emphasize that approach in their unusual cousinly quest for open Senate seats.
''We are not opposed to good sound development, but there cannot be carelessness and recklessness in the use of resources,'' said Tom Udall, 60, who is running in New Mexico while Mark Udall, 57, campaigns in neighboring Colorado.
Yet with gas prices at levels where filling the family pickup truck can cost more than $100, their Republican opponents are trying to turn the Udall trademark into a black mark. They contend that the Udalls' resistance to new drilling and to wringing oil out of Rocky Mountain shale has contributed to the energy cost squeeze. 
''People are angry the Udalls have worked in tandem to drive the prices up as far as they are,'' Bob Schaffer, a former House member running against Mark Udall, said as he shook hands at the Fourth of July parade in Greeley, Colo. -- a bit of Americana kicked off by a herd of longhorns. ''They want to see us move faster on production of American resources.''
The two intertwined campaigns are emerging as a test of whether Democrats are truly ascendant in the conservative West, which will hold the party's national convention in Denver next month and figures prominently in the calculations of both presidential campaigns. The two Senate seats are being vacated by Republicans, Pete V. Domenici in New Mexico and Wayne Allard in Colorado, and twin Udall victories would mean that all four senators from the two states would be Democrats.
Given the increasing focus on energy as a dominant topic in both contests, the races could also show whether voters respond to the Udall call for a more varied and comprehensive approach to energy production or to a concerted Republican push for the aggressive production of fossil fuels.
To Stewart Udall, Tom's father and the family patriarch, who still follows public affairs from his adobe home in the hills above Santa Fe, the election is the moment for the nation to confront its energy future.
''This is now the great challenge, to create a new energy policy,'' said Mr. Udall, 88, who served as interior secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and who has been warning for decades that America must curb its oil appetite.
The latest polls show Mark Udall with a lead over Mr. Schaffer in Colorado in a race that had been even. Surveys have Tom Udall with a substantial head start on Representative Steve Pearce, who only last month won a difficult Republican primary.
''In both cases, it is their election to lose,'' said Tom Cronin, a veteran observer of Western politics at Colorado College.
But Mr. Cronin acknowledged that despite the reverence of Westerners of both parties for their surroundings, spiraling gas prices and a heavy reliance on the automobile in the sprawling region could alter views on conservation. ''People are environmentalists only up to a point,'' he said.
Local leaders in the two states are detecting a potential attitude shift. Joseph M. Maestas, the mayor of Espanola, N.M., said he feared that voters were becoming less concerned about the environment and more fixated on their fuel costs.
''They say the federal government and private companies need to be more aggressive,'' Mr. Maestas said at the opening of a new Democratic campaign office in Santa Fe.
Mr. Pearce criticizes Tom Udall as voting consistently against expanded oil drilling and new refinery capacity and resisting oil shale development, a message he will try to convey to voters who he says find themselves choosing between buying gasoline or such necessities as medicine.
''Those are decisions people in New Mexico are having to make,'' said Mr. Pearce, who once owned an oil field services company. Mr. Schaffer, the Colorado Republican, also worked in the energy field as an executive at a Denver company that now produces mainly natural gas.
Residents of the wide-open West are plainly frustrated with gas prices.
''It has gotten so bad I am taking the bus to work, and that is an hour and a half,'' an exasperated Maureen Santarelli of Centennial, Colo., said as she filled up in Aurora, adding that the switch to the bus had doubled her commuting time.
Tom Udall pointed out that Mr. Pearce and his fellow Republicans for years opposed even minimal increases in auto mileage standards and said they continued to perpetrate ''the cruel hoax'' that the nation could drill itself out of the energy crunch.
Mark Udall, a leader of the Congressional renewable energy caucus who has been instrumental in slowing oil shale development, said that the technology was untested and could require huge amounts of water and power that the West could not spare.
He said the idea that he and his cousin had a blanket opposition to added oil production was wrong. They simply want more emphasis on renewable and alternative fuels, he said, as well as more conservation, particularly given a changing Western economy built on tourism.
''We can't eat our scenery, but it is quite a draw,'' said Mark Udall, a lifelong outdoorsman who once tried unsuccessfully to reach the summit of Mount Everest. ''Everyone in our state understands that the ability to hunt and ski and fish and be outside is what really makes it special to live in the West. That is why the overemphasis of this administration on drilling at all costs is just not sustainable.''
The Udalls grew up together outside Tucson in homes separated by only a short bike ride. They explored the desert foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains and attended the same small elementary school. Now they get together frequently in the Capitol, sometimes raise campaign money jointly and occasionally promote the informal family slogan: Vote for the Udall Nearest You.
The family eschews any talk of a Udall dynasty or a comparison to the Kennedys; they see politics as an outgrowth of the family tradition of public service.
''There is no grand strategy in this by the old man,'' said Stewart Udall, whose brother Morris, the former chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and a serious presidential contender in 1976, died in 1998.
Tom Udall entered politics first. He lost two House races before winning election as attorney general, and then he ran for Congress again when he bumped up against term limits. Mark Udall made a quick jump to the House after a term in the Colorado Legislature.
The cousins have similar but not identical politics. They recently split on terrorist surveillance legislation, with Mark backing it and Tom opposing it.
In Congress, both have advocated preservation in their states. For example, Tom Udall successfully sought to protect permanently the Valle Vidal near Taos from oil development and mineral mining. Mark Udall, in concert with state Republicans, won a wilderness designation for the James Peak area along the Continental Divide in Colorado.
The ties of the pioneering Arizona family run deep in the West. A more distant cousin is Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, who faces his own re-election challenge in November. He meets occasionally with his kin in the Capitol.
''I coach them on the economy, they coach me on the environment,'' said Mr. Smith, who, like his cousins, has long opposed oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Given their history in Arizona, the Udalls also have a close relationship with the state's senior senator, John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Morris mentored Mr. McCain in the House, Mark has a notable friendship with him, and Tom traveled with him to Iraq on a Congressional trip.
While the Udalls say they are pulling for Mr. Smith due to their blood connection, they draw the line at Mr. McCain.
''I look forward to working with John McCain, as will Tom, next year in the United States Senate when he returns,'' Mark Udall said.

HEADLINE: Tired of Rising Gas and Falling Profits, Cabdrivers Seek a Fuel Surcharge on Fares

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Adam Dunn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Complaining that soaring gasoline prices have made it barely possible for them to scrape by, 17 cabdrivers held a rally on Monday afternoon outside the Lower Manhattan headquarters of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, demanding that the panel impose a fuel surcharge on fares.
 The chairman of the commission, Matthew W. Daus, who noted that fares had been increased twice since 2004, said in a statement, ''We do not believe that circumstances warrant a surcharge or adjustment.'' However, he added, ''We will continue to monitor the situation closely.'' 
 The taxi industry in New York City is stratified, with large and profitable fleets at the top of the pyramid, independent owner-operators in the middle and, at the bottom, a large work force -- many of them nonunionized immigrants -- who lease medallions from middlemen known as leasing agents or, in some cases, from fleets. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which organized the protest on Monday, mostly comprises members of the third group, some of whom own their vehicles and some of whom lease them.
 ''Why are taxi drivers treated as second-class citizens?'' asked Bhairavi Desai, the chief organizer of the workers' alliance, who presented commission officials with a petition requesting a temporary fuel surcharge. Several other cities have imposed such surcharges, she noted.
 Bill Lindauer, a driver and a member of the alliance's organizing committee, said the Bloomberg administration had disregarded the economic straits drivers faced with gas prices that now exceed $4 a gallon.
 ''This is how the mayor treats working people?'' he asked, adding, ''I believe the mayor is a bold, innovative and pragmatic man, but he has an Achilles' heel; he doesn't feel for other people.''
 In May 2004, fares were increased by 26 percent, the first such increase in eight years. Three-quarters of that increase went directly to the drivers; the rest benefited medallion owners in the form of lease caps, the amount the owners are permitted to charge drivers leasing their medallions.
 In November 2006, the commission doubled the fare passengers pay while waiting in traffic to $24 an hour from $12, and all of that increase went directly to drivers, said Allan J. Fromberg, a spokesman for the commission.
 According to the commission, the average daily gross earnings for a driver who owns his or her own vehicle and leases a medallion were $290.75 in June, unchanged from June 2007. (Fleet drivers and lease drivers, who rent both the car and the medallion, make 20 cents an hour less on average, according to the commission.)
 But because per-gallon gasoline prices increased to $4.45 from $3.44 over the same period, the actual earnings per hour for drivers fell, to $13.41 from $14.59 for drivers of a Ford Crown Victoria, and to $16.12 from $16.69 for drivers of the Ford Escape, which runs on a hybrid of gasoline and electricity and has a significantly better fuel economy rating.
 Several drivers said they had to work longer hours to make ends meet.
 Victor Salazar, an owner-operator who drives a 2007 Toyota Sienna, and who took part in the protest, said: ''To fill up the gas tank, I spend almost $80 per shift. My shift now is about 14 hours. I have to work more hours to compensate. I work six shifts a week. Actually it's more like six and a half, because on my day off, I have to go out.''
 Factoring in vehicle maintenance, car insurance, health insurance, liability insurance, the mortgage on his medallion and even the expense of looking for a bathroom while on the road, Mr. Salazar said, ''It's terrible.'' He added, ''It's just amazing that I end up paying this much, even without having any accidents.''
 Loubert Alexander, another owner-operator, said, ''Two years ago, a fill-up cost $40; now it's double that.'' With the hot summer weather, he noted, cabs are burning even more gasoline as they run air-conditioning. (Cabdrivers are required to turn on air-conditioning if the customer requests it.)
 The New York drivers were joined by Ronald Blount, president of the Taxi Workers Alliance of Pennsylvania, based in Philadelphia. ''If I have to pay an extra $30 to $40 a day at the pump, that's my rent,'' Mr. Blount, a lease driver for 25 years, said. ''So we came up to show solidarity.''

HEADLINE: Summer's Reality: Odd Skills and Absurd Obstacles

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
If network programmers had the prescience of the gods, I wonder if they would have bothered with any of the reality competitions crowding the summer schedule, series that don't threaten to distract us from the much better reality competition known as Christie Brinkley's divorce from Peter Cook, a Long Island architect. 
 No embarrassment on ''America's Got Talent'' or ''Wipeout'' or ''I Survived a Japanese Game Show'' could match the marital indignities suffered by Ms. Brinkley. In the spirit of the era she has invited us to bear witness to her humiliation by fighting for news media access to her divorce proceedings, a spectacle she might have titled ''I Survived Marriage to the Joey Buttafuoco of Weathered-Shingle Beach Houses.'' 
 Her grievances -- that her husband slept around and spent a used Toyota's worth of cash on pornography each month -- have inflamed a twisted sisterhood of indignation on television. Last week Megyn Kelly of Fox News wondered whether all married men should be held legally accountable for looking salaciously at women who weren't their wives. 
 ''I don't know why this isn't the question,'' she asked one of the lawyers she was interviewing. ''If a woman finds that her husband is accessing online porn all the time and accessing swinger sites, whether or not he goes through with it, isn't that grounds for divorce?'' 
 It is a mistake to think Americans like to consume shame without contingencies. We relish it best when it comes with side dishes of schadenfreude or sympathy.
 In the current spate of reality series there is no one for whom we might feel sorry, no one to hate, but a whole lot about which we might feel very bad. 
 ''America's Got Talent,'' shown on Tuesdays and now in its third season on NBC, could be called ''America's Economy Really Is in Shambles, and People Will Do Anything for a Long Shot at a Buck.'' This season the judges include David Hasselhoff and Sharon Osbourne, who travel the country looking for people with vaudevillian skills most of us don't share. The chosen then face off for a $1 million prize. One, Busty Heart, recently demonstrated her skill at smashing soda cans with her very large breasts. 
 Mr. Hasselhoff seems to be shaking his head even when he isn't. Looking at him, you imagine he's thinking, ''We're never going to retain our stronghold as an economic superpower like this!'' He is not immune to disturbing fits of xenophobia, reacting uncharitably to singing Romanian twins who announced, ''Our dream is to be international superstars.''
 He called them ''Dracula women,'' said they scared him and then declared, ''It is a land of opportunity, and I'm going to give you the opportunity to go back to Bucharest.''
 Cultural prejudice is the foundation of ''I Survived a Japanese Game Show'': American contestants playing to their regional stereotypes (Cathy from Staten Island is a self-proclaimed big mouth) live in a group house in Japan with a battle-ax native they call mama-san, who yells at them to refrain from wearing shoes inside. 
 When they're not at home remarking on the weirdness of the culture (Cathy: ''All the beds are on the floor. I was like, wow'') and the ickiness of the food, they are competing on a game show in a Tokyo television studio, one that has them running on conveyor belts with trays of rice balls on their heads. The series, shown on Tuesdays on ABC, doesn't merely aim to persuade us of the fabled absurdities of the Japanese game show but to resurrect Orientalist ideas about the inscrutability of the Asian race. 
 ''Wipeout,'' also on Tuesdays on ABC, is set right here in the United States but borrows the Japanese conceit of the ridiculous obstacle course as a means of physical competition. Here contestants, many overweight and middle-aged, try to jump over big rubber balls set in pools of mud, for instance. (The show is sponsored, inexplicably, by Lyrica, a drug for fibromyalgia, whose victims are probably the least likely people on earth to watch grown men and women doing stupid things to incur back pain. At least on ''The Singing Office,'' a new reality series on TLC, one of the contestants actually has the condition.)
 If you like watching out-of-shape people and strippers and cellphone salesmen fall down a lot, then ''Wipeout'' could stand as your own very special fetish pornography. In just another example of the way reality television refuses to reward actual hard work, contestants on ''Million Dollar Password'' (whose season ended on Sunday on CBS) can potentially receive $1 million for guessing ''ravioli'' when their celebrity partners shout ''pasta,'' while the chumps on ''Wipeout'' slather themselves in dirt for the grand hope of $50,000. 
 As one contestant puts it in an ad for the show: ''$50,000! I'm not giving it to charity!''

HEADLINE: Loan Pains Turned Site Into a Hit

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
The misery in the housing market is registering on the Implode-O-Meter.
 As millions of homeowners fall behind on their mortgages, a fledging Web site called the Mortgage Lender Implode-O-Meter is gleefully tallying the number of lenders that run into trouble too. On Monday, the count was 265 -- and rising.
 With its tongue-in-cheek tone and running lists of the ''imploded'' and the merely ''ailing,'' the Implode-O-Meter has become a sort of Gawker of the subprime world. At a recent Mortgage Bankers Association conference, a speaker addressed what has become a hot topic among lenders: how to keep your company's name off the site. 
 ''No one wants to be number 266,'' said Jim Reichbach, a vice chairman and leader of Deloitte's banking and securities team. ''This is a death toll that is equivalent to the casualty ticker of the Vietnam War.''
 The Implode-O-Meter is the brainchild of Aaron Krowne, a former researcher at Emory University in Atlanta. A computer scientist and mathematician, Mr. Krowne, 28, started the site in 2007, believing that the troubles in the housing market, and by extension the mortgage industry, would worsen. 
 He was right -- and the Implode-O-Meter took off. Traffic on the site soared, reaching as many as 100,000 regular visitors, and advertising dollars rolled in. Mr. Krowne quit his day job and hired 10 people for his company, Implode-Explode Heavy Industries.
 ''The crisis has come in waves,'' Mr. Krowne said. ''It just keeps coming.''
 With the economy struggling, more financial companies, even well-known ones, are finding themselves on the fated list. When parts of Bear Stearns's residential mortgage unit were sold to private equity investors, for instance, the Implode-O-Meter recorded the sale. And E*Trade Financial could not remove the link on its site to its mortgage division or change the recording on its mortgage division's 1-800 number without the site chiming in. 
 The tips usually come anonymously from employees at the troubled mortgage companies. Critics of the site say some of the tips have been more gossip than reality. But the Implode-O-Meter often posts the phone recordings and company e-mail to back up the bad news coming out of places like Merrill Lynch, which in March fired nearly everyone at First Franklin Financial, a business it purchased in 2006.
 The Implode-O-Meter is just the latest iteration of online death-watch lists. When the dot-com bubble burst, a slew of similar sites popped up, most notably one with an obscene name playing off the title of Fast Company, the magazine. That site and others like it faded when the technology company blowups were no longer front-page news.
 Mr. Krowne is hoping to keep his franchise around longer by looking for trouble in areas like hedge funds, banks, home builders -- the list goes on. It has been an adventurous 18 months for the site, including a nasty lawsuit, a run-in with a celebrity and attention from financial commentators like CNBC's Jim Cramer. 
 As more mortgage companies go broke, Mr. Krowne hopes to turn a tidy profit by selling his site, possibly to a media company. He takes advertising from ''nonimploded lenders,'' which, he says, his company has scrutinized. On occasion, he says, he has had to remove a lender's name from the safe list as their fortunes turn, though he declined to name which ones.
 The Implode-O-Meter, Mr. Krowne likes to say, has beat out the mainstream media time and again. Case in point, he says, was last October when it broke the news that Michael Jackson faced foreclosure on his Neverland property. Mr. Jackson's representatives quickly denied the Implode-O-Meter's story, which Mr. Krowne chalks up to his start-up status. His response? He posted the notice of Mr. Jackson's defaults.
 In December, proof of trouble at one mortgage company came in the form of a 42-second audio track. Family First Mortgage, a lender in Palm Coast, Fla., now out of business, laid people off by phone recording. The call began, ''Thank you for calling Family First Mortgage Corp. If you have been directed to this voicemail box, your employment with Family First Mortgage Corp. has been officially terminated, effective immediately.''
 Glenn Hill, the vice president of the company, wrote by e-mail in late June that the recording as played on the Implode site had been altered, but he did not provide evidence backing up the claim. Implode-O-Meter denies it altered the recording. The Family First call, which is still available on the Implode-O-Meter site, explains that the company was trying to focus attention on brokers who were still generating profits. It ends with: ''Thank you to everyone, and have a great day.''
 Mr. Krowne can hardly suppress a laugh when describing the recording. What surprises him is that failing companies seem to put on ''Herculean efforts'' to convince the rest of the world, and their own employees, that they are sound. 
 ''Every company thinks it is different,'' Mr. Krowne says. He points to April last year as an example. Employees of SouthStar Funding, a mortgage company in Atlanta, bombarded him with phone calls at his day job, trying to persuade him that the company was fine after he placed it on his Ailing Lender list, he said. After all, the employees told him, they were being sent on a team-building trip to the Bahamas. Soon, Mr. Krowne said, he started getting threats from the company.
 When SouthStar folded, Mr. Krowne wrote: ''I have to say that it is with genuine satisfaction that I post this report of SouthStar's closure.''
 Not every company goes down without a fight, though. Loan Center of California, of Suisun City, Calif., sued Mr. Krowne's company over a posting, saying it published false information, including that the company was out of business when it says it was still making loans. The parties settled in December, and Mr. Krowne insists he was unfairly pursued as a small Web entrepreneur. 
 But while Mr. Krowne records the pain of the mortgage industry, he said he does not relish it. ''I really wish that our esteemed policy makers would pay attention and not repeat the same mistake,'' Mr. Krowne said. ''It's so depressing.''

HEADLINE: In Election Dispute, a Challenge for Mongolia's Democracy

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia 

 BODY:
The charred shells of two Soviet-style buildings rising from the center of this capital stand as a warning of the dangers of mixing vodka with voter frustration.
 In a barren land where nomads still gallop across pastures to polling booths, that potent mix led last week to the literal gutting of some of the country's most prominent political and cultural institutions. 
 Now, with an election in dispute, Mongolia's fledgling democracy faces its biggest challenge since its birth in 1990.
 Following cries of fraud in parliamentary elections -- accusations that were disputed by international election observers -- hundreds of rioters, many of them drunk, attacked the headquarters of the dominant political party and the neighboring national art gallery on July 1. Fires were started. Five people were killed. More than 1,000 pieces of artwork were destroyed, damaged or looted. 
 ''Poverty and corruption are eating away at our democracy,'' said Tsedevdamba Oyungerel, a Stanford-educated politician who ran for Parliament but lost (though she did receive 10 male horses as gifts while campaigning in the countryside.)
 To Oyungerel, who like many Mongolians goes by her given name, just as shocking as the violence was the government's reaction -- it declared a four-day state of emergency, sent soldiers into the streets and shut down television and radio stations. 
 The outburst of violence was without precedent in democratic Mongolia, and many here -- from sheepherders to business executives -- are deeply ashamed of what unfolded.
 ''I thought, 'This is totally wrong,' '' said Gansuren, a bartender at a karaoke club.
 Much is at stake for the United States as Mongolia struggles to right itself. With a population of three million scattered across a country the size of Alaska, it is, as one Mongolian leader put it last week, the only democracy between the Sea of Japan and Eastern Europe. 
 Mongolia has supplied troops for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the former secretary of defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld, was given a horse when he visited in 2005 (he left it behind).
 ''Since the overarching aim of our foreign policy is to promote the expansion of democratic society in the world, Mongolia is a poster child for that,'' said Mark C. Minton, the American ambassador here. ''It's my strong belief that democracy is here to stay in Mongolia.''
 The state of emergency ended Sunday, and much seems back to normal now in the capital. A wedding couple poses for photos in the central square. A herder leads three loping camels through the streets. The Grand Khaan Irish Pub is packed.
 But the country faces two major problems: resolving the contentious election -- the official results still have not been announced -- and identifying the cause of the recent violence. 
 Though many Mongolians say the riot was a criminal act, the anger most likely bubbled up from economic frustrations. Inflation has soared to 26 percent, Mongolians complain about corruption, and officials disagree on control of mining rights to the country's immense mineral wealth. 
 Prime Minister Sanjaagiin Bayar defended the state of emergency on Saturday night, saying the government, which is ruled by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, or M.P.R.P., was concerned with preventing further disturbances. 
 But Oyungerel and other senior members of the main opposition group, the Democratic Party, accused the government of using the riot as a pretext for quashing dissent. The only television station allowed to broadcast from Wednesday to Saturday was the national network.
 On the surface, Mongolia is an unlikely place for an experiment in democracy. It is the most sparsely populated country in the world. Half the population still lives in round felt tents called gers, and livestock outnumber humans eight to one.
 Yet Mongolia's literacy rate is 98 percent, a legacy of nearly seven decades of Communist rule. The country held a constitutional referendum in 1990 and a vote in 1992 that led to its first democratic change of Parliament. Since then, it had held peaceful elections every four years -- until June 29.
 Preliminary results announced shortly after the voting showed that the M.P.R.P. won 45 seats; the Democratic Party 28 seats; and three small parties one seat each. Those numbers would give the ruling party the majority it needs in the 76-seat Parliament to form a government. 
 In a news conference on July 1, however, the leader of the Democratic Party and a former prime minister, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, accused the M.P.R.P. of vote fraud. That assertion was challenged by the 52 foreign observation teams that went to polling stations on June 29. 
 ''In each of those cases, in each of the instances where we observed any part of the process, we were struck by the degree of rigor,'' said Bill Infante, country representative for the Asia Foundation, a group that promotes democracy, whose observers visited 100 of about 1,700 stations.
 Nevertheless, on the afternoon of July 1 several leaders of smaller parties held a rally at the capital's central plaza, Sukhbaatar Square. The protest began peacefully. But in time an angry crowd of young men formed in front of the five-story headquarters of the ruling party, next to the square.
 Soon they were throwing rocks and storming the building. Police officers fired tear gas and rubber-coated bullets. Nothing worked. The rioters started fires at dusk. They broke into a duty-free shop on the first floor and grabbed the liquor. Some were already carrying bottles of cheap Mongolian vodka.
 ''It was a pity to see how they were demolishing quite expensive drinks,'' said Sumati, a pollster here. ''It's $30 or $40 a bottle. It's really not cheap.''
 Rioters barged into the museum next door, the Mongolian National Modern Art Gallery. They set fire to the building at 11:30 p.m. and made off with some wood and ivory carvings, said Enkhtsetseg, the museum director.
 Two storage rooms with modernist oil paintings suffered fire damage, as did a wing of traditional art that included tapestries, paintings and carvings. Of the museum's 5,000 pieces, more than a fifth were destroyed, damaged or stolen, Enkhtsetseg said. None are insured.
 ''I have no idea how to put a value on this,'' she said as she chain-smoked in her office on Sunday (she had quit six years ago, but took it up again last week). ''It's unique; we don't have anything like this. Most of the artists have passed away.''
 Next door, in the home of a national orchestra, horse-head violins had been destroyed. 
 The police arrested more than 700 people, and as of Saturday more than 200 were still in jail, Prime Minister Bayar said at a televised news conference that night. ''The police are paying attention not to violate human rights or treat prisoners badly,'' he said.
 But some Mongolians say prisoners have been tortured. Enkhtsetseg said a prisoner released on July 3 came to her office and showed her bruises on his back. He had been among a group of young men trying to save artwork the night of the riot but had been mistakenly arrested, Enkhtsetseg said.
 As the country's leaders grapple with how to resolve the election, everyone knows nothing less than the future of Mongolia is at stake.
 ''We made our democracy ourselves, we will defend it ourselves,'' Oyungerel said. ''I love democracy. I want to give this society to my children.''

HEADLINE: Washington Post Signals Shift With a New Editor

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Signaling a generational change at one of the nation's most influential newspapers, the new publisher of The Washington Post on Monday selected an outsider as the paper's top editor.
 Marcus W. Brauchli, a former top editor of The Wall Street Journal, will become the executive editor of The Post on Sept. 8, at a time of great upheaval in the industry. At age 47, he is young enough to remain in place for many years, working alongside the publisher, Katharine Weymouth, who is 42 and has been in her job for five months.
 He will succeed Leonard Downie Jr., 66, who has led The Post's newsroom for 17 years, guiding it to numerous accolades, including six Pulitzer Prizes this year, the most in its history.
 But Mr. Brauchli (pronounced BROW-klee) and Ms. Weymouth take the helm at a time when The Post, like the newspaper industry as a whole, is buffeted by budget cuts, a shrinking newsroom, falling advertising revenue and declining circulation. 
 ''I don't think it's a case of her wanting to shake the place up as much as her having to,'' said Benjamin C. Bradlee, a former executive editor who is a vice president of the Washington Post Company. ''She feels the urgency to change and adapt, and thank heaven.''
 The Post is trying to meld its print and online news operations -- something The Journal has already done -- and that task is high on the priority list of Ms. Weymouth, the first Post publisher with direct control of its Web site. The two operations have been kept apart to a degree that is rare in the industry -- the Web site even has a separate newsroom, in Virginia -- which has bred duplication and turf wars.
 In a statement, Ms. Weymouth said that Mr. Brauchli's experience at The Journal would ''help us navigate the new world of media.''
 Her decision to pass over candidates within The Post and hire Mr. Brauchli comes shortly into a tenure that has already made clear that she intends to shake up the venerable but financially troubled paper. She is in the fourth generation of her family to head the paper that her great-grandfather, Eugene I. Meyer, bought in 1933, and is considered the likely successor to her uncle, Donald E. Graham, 63, as chairman and chief executive of the Post Company, which also owns Newsweek magazine and the Kaplan educational business. 
 But her choice of Mr. Brauchli is a surprising one at a paper best known for its political coverage and inside-the-Beltway savvy. Some editors and reporters at The Post say that changing the leadership in the midst of a hard-fought presidential campaign is an unorthodox and potentially disruptive move.
 Mr. Brauchli has little experience in Washington, but at The Journal he helped oversee coverage of presidential campaigns and served as a foreign correspondent. Former colleagues say he has no trouble adapting to new territory.
 ''He has one of the quickest minds, and he has the ability to accumulate an enormous amount of information and very quickly become sophisticated on any topic,'' said Stephen J. Adler, editor in chief of BusinessWeek and a former Journal editor.
 It is not clear what role will be played by The Post's second-ranking editor, Phillip Bennett, who has the title of managing editor and was a candidate for the top job. People who have discussed the matter with Post executives -- and who insisted on anonymity to avoid upstaging those executives -- said that an arrangement with multiple managing editors was under consideration.
 The other serious contenders for executive editor were Jonathan Landman, the deputy managing editor of The New York Times; Jon Meacham, the editor of Newsweek; and David Ignatius, a Post columnist and former editor.
 When Mr. Brauchli became the managing editor of The Journal, the top newsroom position there, in May 2007, he was a popular choice among his colleagues. Seven months later, the paper was taken over by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and Mr. Murdoch and the publisher he installed, Robert Thomson, pressed for an array of changes in the content of The Journal and the way the newsroom was organized -- changes that much of the newsroom opposed.
 Mr. Brauchli resigned in April to become a consultant to the News Corporation, saying, ''I have come to believe the new owners should have a managing editor of their choosing.'' Mr. Thomson then took his place. Some of Mr. Brauchli's former colleagues were bitter that he did not fight the changes made by The Journal's new owners, but many others said his position was untenable from the start.
 Mr. Brauchli left The Journal with a severance package that news reports valued at several million dollars; it is not clear whether joining The Post changes the terms of that package, if at all. He declined to comment for this article, as did Ms. Weymouth.
 At The Post, he takes on a set of serious challenges. Since 2000, the paper's weekday circulation has declined to 673,000, from about 800,000, but is still the seventh-highest among American newspapers. Its Web site draws more than nine million unique visitors monthly, according to Nielsen Online, making it the third-highest for a newspaper Web site. 
 But like all newspapers, The Post has been unable to convert that heavy Web traffic into enough dollars to outweigh the loss of print advertising and circulation revenue. The Post has responded to the economic pressures by reducing its news staff from more than 900 people early in this decade to about 700, and executives there expect it to shrink further in the next few years.
 The newspaper division of the Post Company, which consists mostly of The Post itself, reported an operating profit of just $1.2 million in the first quarter, on revenue of $206.1 million, down from $14.9 million in profit a year earlier.
 On the whole, the Post Company is less threatened by the industry's transformation than most of its newspaper brethren, because it is far less reliant on newspapers, bolstered by its Kaplan educational unit and its broadcast and cable television holdings. It reported earnings of $39.3 million in the first quarter, down 39 percent from a year earlier, despite an 8 percent increase in revenue, to $985.6 million.
 The company's stock is down 42 percent from its peak in 2004, reflecting a broad decline in the industry.
 Ms. Weymouth is the granddaughter of Katharine Graham, the longtime Post publisher, and daughter of Lally Weymouth, a Newsweek editor and correspondent on foreign affairs. She practiced law for a number of years before joining the Post Company in 1996 as an in-house lawyer, and most of her experience with the company has been in advertising.
 Several people she has worked or consulted with -- most of them requested anonymity to avoid alienating her -- describe Ms. Weymouth as very smart and determined to move quickly to adapt to the challenges posed by the Internet. And they say she is less deferential to some of The Post's traditions than her predecessors were.
 She talked for a time of getting an office in the newsroom, which would be seen at some papers as a breach of the traditional separation of the business and news operations, but company officials say that idea has been shelved.
 Soon after taking over, Ms. Weymouth began conferring with a number of people inside and outside the company about possible editors. Casting a wide net quickly made it a fairly public process, at a time when Mr. Downie and the paper insisted publicly that there were no immediate plans for him to leave -- and it was seen by some of his loyalists as putting pressure on him to go.
 But those who have discussed the succession with her said that Ms. Weymouth recognized her lack of news experience and wisely sought the advice of a wide range of people.
 ''It was pretty un-Graham-like to be so public, but it was what she needed to do,'' said one of the contenders who lost out to Mr. Brauchli. ''She sees that the industry's in crisis.''

HEADLINE: In Act 2 of Life, Doing Work That Matters

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
Dr. Peter I. Pressman decided to retire in 2003 after 40 years as a New York breast cancer surgeon much admired by his patients for the time and skill he devoted to them and their families. 
 He was 68, and a combination of factors told him it was time to call it quits. He found some changes in surgery to be less rewarding, he had a desire to travel more with his wife and office partner, Peggy, and he wanted more time to pursue cultural interests.
 ''I loved work and I never coveted spending a lot of time on the golf course, but I looked forward to not having to get up at 5:30 every morning and being able to read the newspaper before nightfall,'' Dr. Pressman, now 72, said in an interview.
 ''I was obsessed at first about whether I'd have enough to do, but I soon discovered I didn't get enough done. I needed more structure in my life. I also missed the ongoing relationships with my patients and the intellectual and social stimulation from interacting with colleagues.'' 
 With Dr. Yashar Hirshaut, he had written ''Breast Cancer: The Complete Guide'' in 1993, a book that got him interested in nonsurgical aspects of the disease. He worked on another revision of the book that was published in 2004. 
 And when Weill Cornell Medical Center asked him to develop and direct a genetic risk assessment program to help women affected by genes that raise their risk of breast and ovarian cancer, Dr. Pressman accepted gladly.
 ''My professional goal had always focused on bettering the lives of women, and this is something meaningful that enables me to continue to help women and remain involved professionally,'' he said. 
 ''I'm in the clinic two days a week and see every patient personally,'' he continued. ''With this commitment, I find I structure my time better and get to do a lot more. I make lists of the things I want to do and find the time to do them.''
 A Meaningful Encore
 Dr. Pressman is a classic example of a retiree who reinvented himself. Marc Freedman, the founder of Civic Ventures, an institution seeking to capitalize on the experience of baby boomers in solving the world's problems, calls it ''Encore: Finding Work That Matters in the Second Half of Life.''
 That is the title of his 2007 book that challenges complacency about retirement (published by PublicAffairs), and the fundamental idea behind encore.org, an online network for people who want to use their experience to create meaningful ''encore careers.'' 
 In the book, Mr. Freedman emphasizes the logistical and financial fallacies inherent in an ''endless retirement, 30 years of R & R,'' and the individual and societal need for older people to continue to work, but in ways different from their earlier years.
 In 1935, when Social Security was established for Americans 65 and older, the average life expectancy was 61. Today, Mr. Freedman points out, many baby boomers ''can expect to live 30 or more years beyond traditional retirement age.'' 
 As 70 million baby boomers approach 65, the country is facing both an impoverished Social Security system and empty retirement accounts among millions of older people.
 In place of the hand-wringing and doomsday predictions, Mr. Freedman suggests creating new approaches and opportunities for 60-somethings, especially in the public and nonprofit sectors. 
 Like members of the Experience Corps (created by Mr. Freedman) who help children succeed in school, these people might work part time as volunteers, with their expenses paid, to fulfill important community needs.
 Finding a Good Fit
 Encore career possibilities are endless. They can be lucrative and personally fulfilling. In their book, ''Don't Retire, Rewire!'' (Alpha, 2007), Jeri Sedlar and Rick Miners provide a step-by-step guide to help people approaching the second half of life discover their passions and purpose. 
 Noting that many people ''flunk retirement,'' they list many reasons for retirees to ''rewire,'' among them a need for mental stimulation and a desire to remain productive, do something meaningful and make a difference for others.
 This husband-and-wife team recognizes that for some people, personal reasons predominate, like wanting to do long-postponed activities, find a better balance between work and play and continue to make money while doing something they love.
 The authors put future retirees through their paces. They list and describe 30 possible reasons that people want to work, to help them identify their most important goals and find a good rewiring fit. They also discuss what people may lose when they retire, like involvement with others, the energy of the workplace and a feeling of importance.
 Sometimes the best fit is to continue doing your life's work but on a less demanding schedule. For example, I retired officially from The New York Times 10 years ago, after 32 years as a full-time science writer
 I have, however, continued to do the work I love most -- writing this weekly column as a contract writer and speaking to lay and professional audiences about fostering good health. 
 The reduced workload enables me to spend much valued time with my four grandsons and good friends, as well as enjoy more cultural events, travel, physical activities and hobbies like gardening, knitting and crocheting.
 A New Model
 But in reading the books mentioned above, I realize that I am still missing something -- the personal (as opposed to financial) giveback to social causes that I might support, like helping parents and schools turn out healthier children and helping young people achieve a wholesome work-life balance.
 Ms. Sedlar and Mr. Miners quote Norma Collier, a 62-year-old marketing manager who wants to make a difference: ''Before I die I want to do something to make the world a better place, and this is the time to do it -- not when I'm really old and decrepit, but when I'm still active.''
 As these authors put it: ''Rewiring is different from retirement because it starts from inside you. Rewiring is not about responding to someone else's goals for you or living out society's agenda for you. Rewiring comes from you, your personal motivators, your vision, your dreams, your goals and your values. That's why rewiring is so satisfying for so many people.''
 According to Mr. Freedman, the time is now to put in place a new model of retirement, both for the sake of individuals and for the society in which we all live. 
 Those who are pioneering this new model, he says, ''are not celebrating their freedom from work, but rather their freedom to work, in ways that hold the promise of personal fulfillment, economic benefit and social renewal.''
 By 2050, he points out, the average 65-year-old will live to age 90. Dr. Pressman has found his niche. What will you be doing with all those years?

HEADLINE: MORTGAGE FEARS DEPRESS SHARES AT TWO AGENCIES

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
As home prices decline and Washington struggles to end the economic malaise, Wall Street is starting to send a sobering message: The worst is yet to come.
 One of the strongest warning signs came Monday, when shares of the nation's most important mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, plummeted. 
 After falling almost continuously over the past month, in just one day Freddie Mac tumbled 18 percent, and Fannie Mae lost 16 percent amid concerns that the companies would need to raise billions of dollars in fresh capital. 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the nation's largest buyers of home mortgages, and traditionally the government's backstop for the housing economy. But with Monday's plunge, each of these giants has now lost more than 60 percent of its market value this year. The declines, along with a falling stock market and growing unease about the possibility of more losses at big banks, reflect a growing consensus among investors that the current housing slump will last longer, and prove more severe, than initially feared.
 As a result, investors are signaling that they are far from convinced that any enterprise -- even ones with the strongest backing -- can successfully navigate these choppy waters, and that those who do survive will pay dearly.
 ''Everything points to a lot more bad news to come,'' said Paul Miller of the Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group in Arlington, Va. ''If Fannie and Freddie are vulnerable, it means no one is absolutely safe.''
 Representatives of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae declined to comment on their stocks' performances on Monday. Freddie Mac closed at $11.91, the company's lowest price since 1994. Fannie fell to $15.74, its lowest level since 1992.
 The stocks' dips were part of a broad decline in financial shares. Shares of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase fell more than 3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended a tumultuous day down half a percent.
 The decline in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae comes at a delicate time for the financial markets. In coming weeks, many of the nation's largest financial institutions -- including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch -- will report results that investors worry will be disappointing. Lehman Brothers, which some on Wall Street worry might run into trouble similar to that at Bear Stearns, continues to struggle to restore confidence among investors. Lehman's share price fell more than 8 percent on Monday. 
 If banks' results are as gloomy as anticipated, the news could depress other sectors of the stock market and further sap consumer confidence, which is already battered by rising oil costs, mounting credit card defaults and prices that are rising because of spiraling energy costs and a weakening dollar. 
 Worldwide, banks and brokerage firms have written down the value of the assets they hold, notably those linked to mortgages, by more than $400 billion since the beginning of last year. In April, the International Monetary Fund said total losses for banks, insurance companies and investment funds may reach $945 billion, and some forecasters say the bill could be even higher.
 ''The economic story has gotten worse and worse and worse, and every financial institution seems like it's in freefall,'' said Steven D. Persky, managing director at Dalton Investments in Los Angeles, which manages about $1 billion. ''It's not clear at all when this ends.''
 The gloomy news also threatens to further shrink Washington's influence over the economy. Legislators are widely expected to approve a housing rescue bill by the end of the month. That legislation will overhaul the regulatory structure for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are government chartered enterprises, and will force the two companies to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars each year to the government to refinance troubled home loans.
 But the reform legislation will also likely bolster the odds that taxpayers will foot the bill if either company falters. 
 ''If Fannie or Freddie ever became critically undercapitalized, their regulator would have no choice but to put in place a taxpayer rescue,'' said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, a consulting company.
 To ward off that possibility, in recent weeks Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. have urged Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to raise additional capital from investors.
 But as share prices at the companies have declined, raising new funds has become increasingly difficult. Freddie Mac, for instance, announced on May 14 that it intended to sell $2.75 billion in new common stock to investors. Since then, the company's stock price has declined by 56 percent. 
 As a result, Freddie Mac will have to issue more than twice as many shares to raise the new funds. When those new shares hit the market, they are likely to further push the company's stock price down, and make it even harder for Freddie Mac to recover when the market eventually rebounds.
 It is unclear precisely why Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suffered so greatly on Monday. Early in the day, analysts at Lehman Brothers estimated that a proposed change in accounting rules would require the companies to raise about $75 billion in additional capital -- an enormous sum for two firms that have already asked investors for $25 billion since last December.
 But other analysts disputed Lehman's conclusions, and even the Lehman report predicted the proposed rule changes would not be enacted, or that the two companies would be exempt.
 Also, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were battered by news on Monday that their cost of borrowing, when compared to what the government pays, had risen to the widest spread since March, when it set a 22-year record. Some analysts feared that the companies would suffer from chaos in the private mortgage insurance market, where they have sought protections from the risk of borrower defaults.
 ''These companies, and the economy in general, are fighting a lot of demons right now,'' said Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings, a ratings firm. ''If things don't get turned around, you're going to see more downward pressure on homebuilding, on financial institutions, on spending. There's not a lot of places that will be protected.''

HEADLINE: South Korean President Fires 3 Cabinet Ministers

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
 President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea dismissed three ministers on Monday in a cabinet reshuffle aimed at restoring public trust in his four-month-old government which has been shaken by weeks of protests against American beef imports. 
 The agriculture, health and education ministers who were replaced Monday have been under fire as South Koreans rallied almost daily to protest the government's decision in April to lift a ban on beef imported from the United States. 
 The initial protests, triggered by fears of mad cow disease, quickly evolved into a broader platform to express grievances against Mr. Lee's policies on education, the economy and other issues.
 ''Today's cabinet reshuffle is designed to give the government a new image and help overcome difficult internal and external situations with a new resolve,'' said Lee Dong-kwan, the chief presidential spokesman.
 The entire cabinet, including the prime minister, offered to resign last month as Mr. Lee's approval ratings dipped below 20 percent. 
 The president apologized for the unpopular beef deal twice and replaced most of his presidential aides last month.
 But his office said on Monday that Mr. Lee decided to retain his main economic ministers to ensure stability and continuity in policies as the country battles high oil prices and inflation that threaten to drag down Asia's fourth-largest economy.
 Mr. Lee was elected in December on promises that he would revive the economy. But the government recently slashed its 2008 economic growth target to a three-year low of 4.7 percent from 6 percent.
 ''It's a stopgap measure and shows President Lee's arrogance in ignoring the people's desire again,'' said Cha Young, the spokesman for the main opposition United Democratic Party, which has been demanding a sweeping cabinet overhaul.
 On Saturday, about 50,000 people protested peacefully in Seoul, despite Mr. Lee's repeated appeals to South Koreans to stop the demonstrations and let his government focus on coping with oil prices.

HEADLINE: Europeans Reconsider Biofuel Goal

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
European officials proposed scaling back drastically on their goal of increasing Europe's use of biofuels, a major about-face on a central environmental and energy issue.
 At the same time, a new report by the British government cast fresh doubt on fuels made from crops as a way to the fight climate change.
 Until recently, European governments had sought to lead the rest of the world in the use of biofuels, aiming to derive 10 percent of Europe's transportation fuels from biofuels by 2020. But the allure has dimmed amid growing evidence that the kind of goals proposed by the European Union are contributing to deforestation, which speeds climate change, and helping force up food prices. 
 ''I think when we will look back we will say this was the beginning of a turning point for Europe on biofuels,'' said Juan Delgado, a research fellow specializing in energy and climate change at Breugel, a research organization in Brussels. ''It will be very difficult now for Europe to stick by its targets.''
 In the United States, one quarter of the corn crop goes to biofuels. An energy bill passed last year requires that 36 billion gallons of biofuels be produced annually by 2022, but criticism of the policy is growing, including calls to end tax breaks for corn-based ethanol.
 A major reason is that over the last 18 months, studies have shown that the current generation of biofuels -- reliant on food crops like canola, corn and soybeans -- helps drive up food prices by using agricultural land, as well as aggravating deforestation, and may be worse for the climate than conventional oil once the cost of production and transport are taken into account. 
 Most of the world's biofuel is extracted from corn in the United States, sugar in Brazil, and both grain and oil-seed crops in Europe.
 Europe's reversal on biofuels had gained significant momentum in recent days. Over the weekend, energy ministers gave one of their strongest signs that European governments were prepared to back away from the 10 percent target. ''We have to decide if the quota can be kept,'' Jochen Homann, the German economics minister, said Saturday in Paris. ''It might be changed.'' 
 Britain, one of the biggest proponents of increased biofuel use, signaled a new course Monday. Ruth Kelly, the British transport minister, said the introduction of biofuels should be slowed down, citing a newly released report warning that current goals for biofuel production could cause a global rise in greenhouse gas emissions and an increase in poverty in the poorest countries.
 ''Given uncertainty and potential concerns, the government will adopt a more cautious approach until the evidence is clearer on environmental and social effects of biofuels,'' Ms. Kelly told the British Parliament.
 The Environment Committee of the European Parliament voted Monday to approve the measure and send it to the full Parliament. Members of each major political bloc on the committee called for a much lower target -- 4 percent -- and said the measures should be reviewed in 2015 before any decision to ratchet up that target to between 8 percent and 10 percent.
 Although the environment committee's vote is not binding, it will add to pressure on the European Commission to issue a revised proposal, said Mr. Delgado, the Breugel expert.
 Under the alternative proposals that the committee voted on, 20 percent of renewable transport fuels would have to come from feed stocks, like algae, that do not compete with food for cropland. Europe also could meet the target by expanding the use of vehicles powered by biogas, electricity or hydrogen by 2015. That figure would rise to as much as 50 percent by 2020. Nations also would have to abide by rules on environmental and social sustainability.
 The changes threaten the European Commission's attempt to influence the creation of global standards to tackle climate-changing emissions. The fading luster of biofuels also threatens its goal of generating 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020, up from 8.5 percent now.
 There is disagreement about the role in rising food prices, and some analysts say that the backlash against biofuels now is going too far. 
 The European Commission has denied that biofuels are helping push up food prices by displacing other agriculture and has vowed to stick by its 10 percent goal.
 Michael Mann, a spokesman, said Monday that higher food prices had been caused by increased demand for meat and dairy products, particularly in China and India, two years of bad harvests around the world, speculation and by restrictions on exports of food commodities by some nations.
 New Energy Finance, a research group in London, said in May that prices had risen 8 percent for grains and 17 percent for oils as a result of biofuels policies. It found effects on the price of sugars had been negligible.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 11, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about biofuels in the European Union misidentified the position held by a German official who commented on the likelihood that European governments would back away from targets for biofuel use. Jochen Homann is a state secretary in Germany's economics ministry; he is not the country's economics minister, a position held by Michael Glos.

HEADLINE: Ted Koppel Tours a China Brimming With Dreams and Consumerism

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Interviewing millionaires and peasants, drag queens and students as he tours nightclubs, classrooms, factories and upscale malls, Ted Koppel takes viewers beyond the oft-seen China in ''Koppel on Discovery: The People's Republic of Capitalism,'' an ambitious four-part series that begins Wednesday night on the Discovery Channel.
 The series, which depicts the complexities of an emerging capitalist economy tethered to an authoritarian government, vividly demonstrates the interdependence of the economies of China and the United States. 
 ''We've covered a lot of bases,'' Mr. Koppel said in an interview, adding that the series is especially important now that many of the news media have cut back on foreign coverage. He has been a managing editor at Discovery for the past two years, after a quarter-century as the anchor of ABC News's ''Nightline.'' 
 ''The People's Republic of Capitalism,'' one of a number of in-depth documentaries Mr. Koppel has done for Discovery, allows viewers a lingering look at Chongqing, a city of 13.5 million people in southwest China. A boomtown of luxury goods and nonstop construction, it is emblematic of the face of Chinese capitalism but unknown to most Americans. 
 ''The U.S. relationship to China is so intricate and so deep that Americans need to know that it's more than cheap labor at Wal-Mart or tainted toys,'' Mr. Koppel said. ''We'd have a hard time extricating ourselves from it.''
 As ''The People's Republic of Capitalism'' illustrates, big American companies like Wal-Mart and Ethan Allen have cut costs by relying on Chinese factories, which in turn allows them to sell lower-priced goods to American consumers. And while it means that some Americans lose jobs to workers overseas -- and the series shows the pain of that displacement -- even those unemployed workers find themselves shopping for the products made in China and arrayed in budget aisles across this country.
 It took Mr. Koppel, the narrator and the on-screen interviewer, and his team of producers over a year to put together the series, with the exchanges with Chinese facilitated by translators. One fascinating segment traces the birth of an Apple iPod, which is designed in California and assembled in China.
 ''The People's Republic of Capitalism,'' shown over four consecutive nights, is being broadcast on the eve of the 2008 summer Olympic Games in Beijing, at a time when human rights advocates have been urging a boycott of the Games to protest China's crackdown on antigovernment protests in Tibet and its support of the government in Sudan. It also comes not long after the devastating earthquake in Sichuan province, a disaster that provoked resentment in China against the government's lack of preparation for the crisis. 
 Mr. Koppel contends that the story of China is as entertaining and dramatic as any novel: 300 million people have escaped poverty in less than a generation, and millions are migrating from the countryside to places like Chongqing, where the juggernaut of capitalism is powering a rapid transformation.
 Often the new values have fueled a kind of lust for acquisition that Part 2 of the series calls ''MAOism to MEism.'' Viewers see young Chinese students intently learning English in order to take their place in the global economy, and a woman who has made millions from owning a restaurant and hotel complex says: ''I am proud of being rich. I made my money through hard work.'' No one in China talked that way in past decades, Mr. Koppel said. 
 The tension between the old and the new finds its way into the series. As an automobile magnate interviewed in Part 2 says, ''With the pressure you get today, you realize in the old days was very simple.'' A young singer who performs in English in a Chongqing nightclub observes, ''Like any city that develops quickly, people are more or less lost in transition.'' That means that almost anything goes, as long as it happens quietly and is not political. 
 For instance, while gay men are more widely accepted, they are expected to retreat into the closet at some point and begin families. 
 Mr. Koppel recalled that the last time he spent an extended period in China was in 1973, at the tail end of the Cultural Revolution. He said he was struck by two major changes on his most recent visit: In the past one saw the occasional car; now the nation is putting 25,000 new vehicles on the road every day. And now, in interview after interview, people talked openly about wanting to get rich, a desire once verboten. 
 ''In 1973 when I asked, 'What do you want to be?' the answers were political,'' Mr. Koppel said. ''People said, 'I'd do whatever the motherland needs of me.' This was a time when intellectuals were being shipped out to the countryside by the millions, and you could not express any personal ambition, because it could cost you your life.
 ''Today people say, 'Hey, I want to get rich, I want to make money.' You can be a capitalist and want nothing to do with democracy. There is the tendency to believe that once you put a Big Mac on the table and wash it down with a Coke, you imbibe the need for democracy. It doesn't happen as quickly as we would like.''
 ''The People's Republic of Capitalism'' has had a number of screenings, at universities and other places devoted to exploring foreign policy and culture. 
 ''I thought it was very well done,'' Adam Segal, a senior fellow in China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, a national policy organization, said in an e-mail message about the documentary. The council's office in New York City held a screening and discussion with Mr. Koppel in June. 
 ''I would not say it adds very much to the scholarly debate, but for the general public it is notable for several reasons,'' Mr. Segal said. ''By showing how the vast majority of Chinese have been made better off by economic development, it provides a credible argument for why, even with fairly widespread social unrest, the reign of the current regime is not seriously challenged.''
 Mr. Koppel said that what has stayed with him are the stories of people who for the first time in their lives have enough to eat and clothes on their backs, allowing them to strive for something more. They call these the ''best of times,'' he said. He recalled a married couple in the country, earning $1,500 a year from manual labor and living on $600 a year so that they might put their two children through school. They dream that the next generation might become professionals with better lives than their own. 
 ''These are what we call great American success stories,'' Mr. Koppel said. ''Well, those kinds of things are happening in China all the time, and it's a thing to behold.''

HEADLINE: Indian Premier Expresses New Hope for Completion of Nuclear Pact With U.S.

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA; Hari Kumar contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
India's prime minister went to the Group of 8 summit meeting in Japan on Monday with his government intact and enough political strength to complete a landmark nuclear agreement with the United States, ending months of speculation that either his government or the agreement, on which he has staked his reputation, would collapse.
 The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, told reporters traveling with him to the summit meeting that his administration would ''soon'' complete an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, though he did not offer a date, his spokesman, Sanjaya Baru, said here. Mr. Baru added that the text of an agreement was near completion, and that India could swiftly finish it and go on to secure approval from the 45 member nations of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Only after those two steps have been completed can the United States Congress vote on the final agreement. 
 A Congressional delegation came here last week to urge India to hurry it along, so that Congress could vote on the deal in early September.
 The nuclear agreement would allow India access to nuclear fuel and technology on the world market.
 Mr. Singh's comments on Monday were the first in many months to sound a note of political confidence. His Congress Party-led coalition government has been beleaguered by a difficult political choice: going through with the nuclear deal would mean losing the vital support of its Communist allies and in turn its majority in Parliament. The Communists have resolutely opposed the nuclear deal, on the ground that it would fortify strategic ties with the United States.
 Saving the deal required a political gamble. Late last week, Mr. Singh's administration secured the support of an old rival, a north Indian faction called the Samajwadi Party, and in so doing, seems to have preserved its majority in Parliament and deferred early elections, which it can hardly afford at a time of rising food and fuel prices and growing public disaffection.
 ''He said the government is not afraid to face the Parliament, we have the numbers,'' Mr. Baru quoted the prime minister as saying, adding that Mr. Singh continued to hope that the Communists would ''see reason'' and lend their support to the deal.
 That is unlikely. The Communist parties are expected to withdraw their backing of the government in the coming days.
 Mr. Singh's successful maneuver on the nuclear agreement does not diminish the government's other problems. It continues to be buffeted by economic woes, along with a range of political fires across the country.
 A Congress Party-led government collapsed on Monday in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir. The crisis in that Muslim-majority state had nothing to do with the nuclear agreement. It stemmed instead from a bitter dispute over using government land for temporary camps for Hindu pilgrims. But it signaled a setback for the Congress Party, which now governs only 9 of India's 28 states, and ushered in the election season in earnest.
 Analysts said that the bargaining over the nuclear agreement may cost the Congress Party the next national election, and that it had already weakened the administration and the prime minister's personal credibility.
 ''Hanging back on the deal has cost it its aura of authority, and has damaged the standing of the P.M.,'' said Salman Haidar, a retired Indian diplomat. ''It's legacy time for him: no other way of restoring his position than to push for the deal, even at this stage.''

HEADLINE: Skepticism on McCain Plan To Balance Budget by 2013

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The package of spending and tax cuts proposed by Senator John McCain is unlikely to achieve his goal of balancing the federal budget by 2013, economists and fiscal experts said Monday.
 ''It would be very difficult to achieve in the best of circumstances, and even more difficult under the policies that Senator McCain has proposed,'' said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group.
 Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is proposing billions of dollars in tax cuts. But advisers to Mr. McCain said those costs would be more than offset by savings from slower growth in spending. 
 In his proposal, Mr. McCain said he would hold overall spending growth to 2.4 percent a year. That is a tall order because federal spending has been growing an average of more than 6 percent a year in the last five years.
 Mr. McCain said he would also slow the growth of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and fiscal experts agree that he would need to do that to achieve his goal. But Mr. McCain did not give details of how he would alter those benefit programs, which have powerful constituencies, including older Americans, a huge health care industry and state and local government officials.
 A longtime foe of pet projects known as earmarks, Mr. McCain said he would stop such spending. The Bush White House says earmarks this year total $17 billion, a comparatively small share of a $2.9 trillion budget.
 Mr. McCain proposed a one-year freeze in most domestic spending subject to annual appropriations, ''to allow for a comprehensive review.'' This proposal would affect education, scientific research, law enforcement and scores of other programs.
 Mr. Bush's battles with Congress suggest it would be extremely difficult for Mr. McCain to win approval for such a freeze.
 Mr. McCain said he was counting on ''rapid economic growth'' to help reduce the deficit. While a growing economy generates additional revenue, several of Mr. McCain's tax proposals would be costly, experts said. 
 He would ''phase out and eliminate'' a provision of the tax code known as the alternative minimum tax, which has ensnared a growing number of middle-class Americans in recent years.
 By his own account, repealing this tax ''will save middle-class families nearly $60 billion in a single year.'' That is $60 billion that would presumably not be available to the Treasury. 
 Mr. McCain also wants to extend many of the Bush tax cuts, scheduled to expire by Jan. 1, 2011. That could reduce tax collections below the levels assumed under current law, and it could widen the deficit, many economists said.
 In January, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that extending the Bush tax cuts would cost more than $700 billion in the next five years.
 Since January, the economy has been weaker than expected, making the goal of a balanced budget more difficult to achieve. The budget deficit in the current fiscal year is running much higher than in the previous year.
 Other McCain proposals, like doubling the personal tax exemption for dependents and cutting the corporate income tax rate, would also reduce revenues, economists said.
 C. Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, who worked in the Reagan administration, said Mr. McCain ''may well be committed to balancing the budget in five years, but does not tell you how he would reach that goal.'' 
 J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who worked at the Treasury under President Bill Clinton, said, ''Senator McCain and his advisers want to claim they will balance the budget by 2013, but they have given us no clue and no plan to meet all the commitments he has made and still get there.''
 On the other hand, history shows the deficit sometimes shrinks faster than experts expect. 
 That happened in 1998 in the Clinton administration, when the government ran a surplus for the first time in nearly three decades. And Mr. Bush cut the deficit in half faster than he or many fiscal experts had predicted.

HEADLINE: McCain Plan For Budget: Fiscal Hawks Vs. Tax Foes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
As Senator John McCain kicked off a week of economic-themed campaigning here on Monday, it was apparent that some of the underlying tensions between the two schools that guide his economic thinking -- the supply-siders who want to cut taxes and the deficit hawks who want to balance the budget -- remain unresolved. 
 Mr. McCain has promised once again to balance the budget by the end of his first term in 2013, his advisers said Monday. They were reverting to an earlier pledge that Mr. McCain abandoned in April, when he proposed a series of costly tax cuts and, citing the ailing economy, said that it might take two terms to balance the budget. 
 ''American workers and families pay their bills and balance their budgets, and I will demand the same of the government,'' Mr. McCain said at a campaign stop here. His top advisers went further, saying he would balance the budget by the end of his first term. 
 But it is unclear how Mr. McCain intends to balance the budget. Fiscal analysts who have examined Mr. McCain's plans say his calls to extend President Bush's tax cuts and cut corporate and other taxes without calling for comparable spending cuts could increase the federal budget deficit significantly.
 The tug of war between wanting steep tax cuts and trying to make sure the government spends no more than it takes in has been a theme this year as Mr. McCain's economic thinking and policies have evolved. 
 In the Senate, Mr. McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts that he now wants to make permanent, warning that they were tilted toward the rich and were not offset by enough spending cuts. In doing so, he incurred the wrath, and suspicion, of many prominent supply-siders. But as a presidential candidate, Mr. McCain has had a circle of advisers that included both card-carrying supply-siders like Jack Kemp, the former New York congressman, and deficit hawks like Phil Gramm, the former Texas senator. 
 But Mr. McCain's early enthusiasm for balanced budgets seems to have cooled slightly in this campaign, and he is much less specific about spending cuts than he is about tax cuts. Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, which advocates fiscal discipline, questioned how Mr. McCain's current proposals could lead to balanced budgets.
 ''It's feasible to balance the budget by 2013, but very unlikely under the policies Senator McCain has proposed,'' Mr. Bixby said in an e-mail message. ''The spending cuts are far too vague to be counted on for significant savings and, even if they were more specific, I can't see how they would come close to offsetting the level of tax cuts he recommends. Looking at this set of proposals, it doesn't seem that McCain fits neatly into either the deficit hawk or supply-side camp.''
 But Mr. McCain's tax cut proposals have won over some of his erstwhile supply-side critics. Last year the Club for Growth, a prominent antitax group, issued a report under the headline ''John McCain is No Supply-Sider'' that faulted him for his earlier opposition to the Bush tax cuts. Now, Pat Toomey, the group's president, said that Mr. McCain's recent tax cut proposals indicated that supply-siders were getting the upper hand.
 ''Is John McCain a supply-sider in his bones?'' Mr. Toomey asked. ''I'm not sure he is. But I do support the positions he has been taking.''
 When Mr. McCain spoke about his tax plan in April, he cited the faltering economy and said that it might take two terms to balance the budget, explaining that ''economic conditions are reversed.'' Since then he seems to have refined some of his earlier tax cut plans. While Mr. McCain's campaign once spoke of repealing the alternative minimum tax, which is aimed at the wealthy but has increasingly ensnared middle-class taxpayers, his advisers now speak of ''phasing out'' the tax. And they now say that his plan to let corporations write off their equipment expenses more quickly would be temporary.
 Mr. McCain, who has been dogged by his own past statements that he does not understand the economy as well as he should, has not always spoken fluently about economic policy during the campaign.
 When he was asked at a town-hall-style meeting in Connecticut in April whether he wanted to ''raise taxes, cut entitlement spending, cut defense spending, or have a deficit,'' Mr. McCain spoke generally about emulating President Reagan, not mentioning that the deficit nearly tripled during the Reagan presidency. 
 And when Mr. McCain first outlined his tax cut proposals shortly before the South Carolina primary in January, he highlighted his new enthusiasm for supply-side economics. ''Don't listen to this siren song about cutting taxes,'' Mr. McCain said then. ''Every time in history we have raised taxes it has cut revenues.'' Of course, history is full of tax increases that raised revenues, just as planned, and many economists deride the notion that broad-based tax cuts will spur enough economic growth to raise tax revenues over all.
 The two pillars of Republican economic thought vying for supremacy in the McCain agenda do not always coexist easily. 
 Deficit hawks believe that keeping the budget balanced will put downward pressure on interest rates, helping the economy. Many supply-siders believe that balancing the budget is a misguided goal, except to the extent that it shrinks government, which is a somewhat different goal. Supply-siders believe that lower taxes will spur economic growth, and that while lower taxes may lead to bigger deficits in the short term, they will eventually produce more revenue and lead to balanced budgets.
 But one of Mr. McCain's top economic advisers, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who said on Monday that Mr. McCain's ''plan is to balance the budget by the end of his first term in 2013,'' suggested that the two arguments are not incompatible. ''You'll never have successful deficit reduction,'' he said, ''without strong economic growth.''

HEADLINE: STOCKS AND BONDS: Markets Decline Even as Oil Pulls Back

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street lost more ground in volatile trading Monday as investors recoiled at a cautious economic outlook from a Federal Reserve official and the possibility of more financial troubles at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The market found only slight solace in retreating oil prices.
Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech that the financial markets remained fragile and that it would take time for conditions to improve. ''My expectation is that market functioning will improve markedly by 2009,'' she said. ''But things could get worse before they get better.'' 
The comments added to concerns raised in a note by Lehman Brothers analysts that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may need to raise more capital as the credit crisis continues. Worries about the ailing financial sector deflated a stock rally early in the day that had been fueled by a $4-a-barrel pullback in oil prices.
The market managed, however, to rebound from its lows of the day, when the Dow Jones industrial average sank to its worst level since mid-August of 2006. Some investors bought back into the market to take advantage of the low prices.
''The market is so skittish and so scared that half the people believe that this is just another leg of the down market and the other half believes that we're forming a bottom,'' said Frank Ingarra, assistant portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.
The Dow fell 56.58 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,231.96. Over the course of the day, the blue chips rallied, tumbled, rebounded, and then fell once more. The Dow fell as much as 167.80 to 11,120.74, its lowest trading level since Aug. 15, 2006, but was also up more than 100 in early trading.
Broader stock indicators also declined. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.59 points, or 0.84 percent, to 1,252.31, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.06 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,243.32.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq was helped by Yahoo, which rose $2.56, or 12 percent, to $23.91 after Microsoft expressed support for Carl C. Icahn's effort to oust Yahoo's board next month. Microsoft said a successful rebellion would encourage it to renew its takeover bid for Yahoo, or negotiate another deal.
Light, sweet crude oil fell $3.92 to settle at $141.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after falling by more than $5 a barrel earlier.
The retreat did little to assuage fears about high energy prices, however. Wall Street, which has been hurtling stocks lower for the past few weeks, remains fearful that consumers are trimming their spending to pay for gasoline. With consumer spending accounting for more than two-thirds of United States economic activity, a pullback could create big ripples.
Government bonds rose. The 10-year Treasury note rose 19/32, to 99 25/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 3.90 percent from 3.97 percent last Thursday.
Fannie Mae fell $3.04, or 16.2 percent, to $15.74 and Freddie Mac fell $2.59, or 17.9 percent, to $11.91, after Lehman Brothers analysts said new accounting rules could require Fannie to raise $46 billion more capital and Freddie to raise $29 billion.
On Monday, the dollar traded mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

WESTERN LEADERS PUSH
For Sanctions on Zimbabwe
In the first three hours of closed-door talks among President Bush, Group of 8 leaders and seven leaders of African countries, the issue of Zimbabwe rose to the forefront. Mr. Bush and the Group of 8 leaders were united on sanctions against Zimbabwe, with Mr. Bush calling the recent election there a sham. President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe warned Western nations not to interfere, and the African Union also rejected the sanctions. Instead, a power-sharing agreement was suggested. Page A8
INDIA AND U.S. FORM NUCLEAR PACT
Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, completed a major nuclear agreement with the United States at the Group of 8 meeting in Japan. The completion of the deal laid to rest months of speculation that the deal itself, on which Mr. Singh has bet his reputation, or his government, would collapse. Page A8 
BUSH AND RUSSIAN LEADER MEET
President Bush was able to size up the new president of Russia, Dmitri A. Medvedev, in person at the Group of 8 meeting. Their first face-to-face meeting lasted more than an hour, later they sat side by side for cameras as they offered policy pronouncements. Afterward, Mr. Bush pronounced the new leader of Russia a ''smart guy.'' Page A8
GRIM FUTURE FOR TAJIK SEERS
Amid economic hardship and anxieties over an uncertain future in Tajikistan, the industry of soothsaying has experienced a boom. The government has responded by outlawing all forms of ''witchcraft,'' viewing the practice as a drain on a people already poverty-stricken. Clients frequenting a soothsayer seek a measure of control over an unpredictable existence. Page A12
EXPLOSION IN GEORGIA KILLS 4
An explosion in a cafe in a separatist region in the former Soviet republic of Georgia killed four people, including a security service official from the rebel government, and injured six others. There are no suspects in the attack, but the leaders of the separatist government blame Georgia, which claims the region as its own. The country has denied involvement. Page A12
TEMPERS FLARE IN MONGOLIA
A state of emergency in Mongolia ended on Sunday. Claims of fraud in an election on June 29 sparked a riot in which five people were killed and thousands of pieces of artwork were destroyed. While no evidence of fraud was found by independent observers, opposition party leaders claimed the vote was fraudulent and the state of emergency was meant to quash dissent, not to stop further violence as claimed by the ruling party.

WHAT WOULD YOU DO
With a Full Tank of Gas?
Once a week for the next two months, the second-prize winners in a new lottery promotion in Florida will win free gasoline for life. Or, more specifically, each winner of Summer Cash will be awarded 26 gas cards worth $100, each every year until death. And some people think that is a better deal than the game's first prize, a quarter of a million dollars. ''Gas has become more precious than cash now,'' one supermarket employee said. PAGE A13
CALIFORNIA GOES HANDS-FREE
Lawmakers in California patted themselves on the back for passing legislation requiring drivers to employ hands-free devices for their cellphones while on the road or face a fine. But many in California -- a state with 22 million drivers -- wonder whether it's the act of holding the phone that leads to accidents or the conversation itself. ''The law does nothing to answer the question of intellectual distraction,'' a spokesman for the American Automobile Association of Northern California said. PAGE A13
FREED CAPTIVES MAKE APPEARANCE
Three Americans who had been held captive in the Colombian jungle since 2003 made their first public appearance, embracing both an American flag and teary-eyed family members at a military hospital. But despite the happiness the men and their families felt, they expressed grave concerns for those who remained in the hands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC -- the most feared insurgent group in Latin America.

MCCAIN'S ECONOMIC TENSIONS
Senator John McCain kicked off a week of economic-themed campaigning, promising once again to balance the budget by the end of his first term if he is elected president, in 2013. But the pledge illustrates how some of the underlying tensions between the two schools that guide his economic thinking -- wanting steep tax cuts and trying to make sure that the government spends no more money than it takes in -- remain unresolved.

OBAMA TO GIVE SPEECH IN STADIUM
Senator Barack Obama will forgo the main convention center in Denver when he accepts the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, and instead will do so in the Broncos' football stadium, which seats more than 75,000 people. And though the move will be rich in historical significance -- on the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's ''I Have a Dream'' address -- it was met with complaints from news executives, who will have to rethink how they cover it. PAGE A13

FARE-JUMPING PENALTIES RISE,

The fine for fare jumping on buses and subways rose to $100 from $60, the first increase in decades. It comes even as evidence suggests that turnstile jumping is not nearly as prevalent as it was in the early 1990s, when there were an average of more than 700 tickets issued or arrests made each day. The transportation authority says it may increase the fine for other offenses and is also considering asking the Legislature to raise the maximum fine it can charge to $200. PAGE B5
NO, NOT THAT 'AZURE'
One of the unintended consequences of the city's historic building boom is the traffic jam of similar sounding names. To showcase the sweeping views from buildings with huge, wrap-around windows, real estate developers are flocking to a set of words that evoke the sky, clouds and stars. ''Many of these names are really bumping into each other,'' said an executive at a major developer in the city. ''It is a bit surprising.'' PAGE B1

To motivate his staff at Sprint Nextel, a company grappling with a lackluster array of cellphones and impatient investors, Daniel R. Hesse, the chief executive, gave workers DVDs of a documentary about Ernest Shackleton, the explorer whose ship was crushed by ice on an expedition to Antarctica. Mr. Hesse liked the movie for its message: the crew survived. But the parallel was probably not lost on Sprint employees, as many have been asking: Can Mr. Hesse stop the company from sinking?

HEADLINE: Diamond District Tenants Worry About Spate of Deals

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Gary Barnett, an international diamond trader turned real estate developer, caused an uproar in the diamond district of Midtown Manhattan in 2006 by getting the city to agree to $49.6 million in subsidies for the 40-story commercial tower that he is building amid the aging low and midrise buildings on 47th Street.
 But then, the concerns of the other building owners about unfair competition were partially alleviated when the City Economic Development Corporation subsequently imposed conditions that would make it far more challenging for Mr. Barnett, the president of the Extell Development Company, to receive the tax abatements. 
 Extell will not get any benefits unless it fills 65 percent of his Diamond Tower with diamond- and jewelry-related tenants and at least 20 percent with businesses that are expanding or are new to the city. The tower's announced price was $434 million. 
 Yet Mr. Barnett, who is developing residential towers across Manhattan, is again stirring fears in the diamond district.
 In recent months, he has snapped up several older buildings to the east of his construction site on West 47th Street, where foundation work is under way. The single block from Fifth Avenue to the Avenue of the Americas has been home to the jewelry industry since just after World War II, when it migrated north from Canal Street and the Bowery.
 As slices of Midtown that catered to fur, flower and toy industries have all but vanished, the diamond district seems increasingly vulnerable. It is sandwiched between office corridors containing some of the costliest space in the country, yet many of its tenants pay a fraction of the rents charged on nearby blocks. 
 ''Tenants are concerned that they are going to get priced out of the neighborhood,'' said Fran Reiter, a deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration who is consulting for the 47th Street Business Improvement District. ''There is unease and trepidation about what the future holds for the industry.'' 
 The business group is trying to improve the street's image by discouraging the presence of hawkers who try to steer customers to certain jewelers on the upper floors and by setting up informational kiosks and security cameras, said Michael Grumet, the executive director.
 Mr. Barnett said he was trying to strengthen the diamond district, not destroy it. He said he wound up owning several buildings while he was assembling the Diamond Tower site by acquiring unused development rights -- known as air rights -- for about two dozen buildings. 
 ''When we were negotiating with landlords for air rights, in some cases they told us there was an opportunity to buy the buildings,'' he said. ''We took it.''
 Extell's holdings now include 30 West 47th Street, 570 Fifth Avenue and a three-quarters interest in 20 West 47th Street, one of the largest buildings on the street. Mr. Barnett said he had no plans -- for now, at least -- to assemble a site for a second tower. ''That was never our intention,'' he said.
 Though data is scarce, longtime business owners on 47th Street say the district is shrinking. When the last survey was conducted in 1992, the district generated $6 billion and employed about 26,000 people in nearly 3,000 businesses, most of them family-owned. But only the highest-grade stones are cut locally. 
 Many buildings on 47th Street are owned by jewelers who have taken little interest in investing in their properties. Still, retail space on the ground floor can be surprisingly expensive, with a small booth near a window renting for as much as $20,000 a month. Upstairs, spaces as small as 500 square feet are leased to stone cutters and polishers, wholesalers and shipping companies. Some tenants are small-scale retailers who attract customers through word of mouth. 
 Though no one expects the ground-floor stores to disappear, the deep discounts that attract both tourists and residents to 47th Street are possible because the manufacturers and retailers work in close proximity, Ms. Reiter said. 
 But one building, 2 West 47th Street, which changed hands in March 2007, has already lost a dozen tenants who could not afford a jump in annual rent from as little as $16 a square foot to $40 when their leases expired, said Keith Lipstein, managing director of ABS Partners, the operator of the building. ''I'm sorry my space is expensive, but this is 2008, not 1978,'' said Mr. Lipstein, who hopes to attract office tenants from other industries to fill the vacancies.
 Harvey Nagin, a jeweler in the diamond district for the last 35 years, is one of 75 owners of a condominium building at 62 West 47th Street. He said the owners are changing the condo bylaws so that they can rent space above the jewelry exchange to businesses outside the industry. ''Otherwise, the spaces are going to be empty,'' he said.
 Robert L. Freedman, the chief executive of GVA Williams, a brokerage firm, describes 47th Street as ''a classic infill site'' that is destined for redevelopment. New York needs the Diamond Tower if it wants to compete with more upscale markets in Shanghai, Dubai and elsewhere, he said.
 By owning and redeveloping other buildings on the street, Mr. Barnett will be able to control rents in the district, he said. ''You want to have as much inventory as possible so you can establish what I call oligarchic pricing,'' Mr. Freedman said.
 Some landlords on 47th Street say that Mr. Barnett will have a tough time qualifying for the tax abatement for the Diamond Tower. One potential major tenant, the Diamond Dealers Club, renewed its lease at 580 Fifth Avenue, a corner building that is being updated. Another major tenant in that building that Mr. Barnett would like to lure away, the Gemological Research Institute, still has about a half-dozen years remaining in its lease, said Kenneth Kahn, an owner of 580 Fifth.
 But if Mr. Barnett cannot attract enough jewelry tenants, he has the option of dividing the 750,000-square-foot tower into two separate buildings, with conventional office tenants entering on the 46th Street side and the jewelry industry on the 47th Street side.
 Mr. Barnett said he planned to upgrade 30 West 47th Street, a 10-story 1957 building he bought last month from the longtime owners, the Herman family, for $30 million, according to PropertyShark.com, a real estate Web site. 
 And he has gone to court to remove F. M. Ring Associates as the manager of 14-story 1924 building at 20 West 47th Street. Other property owners on the block complain that the building is an eyesore, with scaffolding that has been in place for years and a large crack in a second-floor window. The building is only 75 percent occupied, according to the CoStar Group, a research company in Bethesda, Md.
 F. M. Ring, a minority owner of the building, is paying a mere $650 a month for its penthouse space at 20 West 47th Street, which according to a lawsuit that was filed in February by an Extell entity is well below the market value of at least $12,000 a month. 
 Adam P. Pollack, F. M. Ring's lawyer, said Extell had no legal right to cancel the decades-old management contract. He said he could not explain why the building was one-quarter empty or why the scaffolding has not been removed. A court appearance is scheduled for July 17.
 Mr. Barnett said he was determined to be a good neighbor on 47th Street. ''We think the whole block could benefit from an upgrading,'' he said. ''We want the trade to thrive, and we want the block to thrive.''

HEADLINE: Renters Aren't a 'Problem'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Not Just Hartford's Problems'' (editorial, July 3), about the need for an urban agenda for Connecticut: 
 You write that Hartford's ''more fundamental problems'' are ''shared by cities elsewhere: soaring crime, high dropout rates and low home ownership that leads to punishing property taxes imposed on a dwindling base.''
 Are you suggesting that renters are one of the ''fundamental problems''? Renters are people who either choose not to own property or cannot afford to own their homes. But they pay rent to their landlords, who pay property taxes. 
 Meanwhile, the taxes paid for the typical single-family home rarely match the cost of providing services to that home. 
 Historically, nonresidential property has generated the tax money that has allowed for the growth of homes in cities. It is the relocation of that economic engine from the city to suburban industrial parks that has drained inner cities of the money needed to support their civic peace. 
 Connecticut's urban agenda should address that imbalance. Renters aren't the problem.

HEADLINE: Spending Outlook Grows Even Softer

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A LEADING forecaster of advertising spending has reduced -- again -- his prediction for growth this year, joining other analysts who have cut their estimates because of the troubled American economy and difficulties among media like newspapers and radio.
 ''We knew it was going to be a problem year,'' the forecaster, Robert J. Coen, said of 2008, but ''the anxiety has been compounded.''
 ''The biggest, most important marketers,'' he added, in categories like automobiles and telecommunications, ''really pulled in their horns'' in the first few months of the year.
 Another surprise, Mr. Coen said, was that ''newspapers have gotten so much worse,'' particularly in local ad spending. 
 He cited data from the first quarter that showed sharp declines in important categories compared with the period a year earlier: local classified ad revenue, down 24.9 percent, and local retail ad revenue, down 8.6 percent.
 However, results are likely to improve as 2008 continues, buoyed by demand from Olympic marketers and political candidates, Mr. Coen said during a presentation on Tuesday morning in Midtown Manhattan.
 ''It will get better in the second half of the year,'' he said. ''I think the worst is over in terms of the slowdowns.''
 That is why Mr. Coen is still calling for an increase in ad spending this year compared with 2007, albeit of 2 percent rather than a gain of 3.7 percent, which he forecast in December, or an increase of 5 percent, which he predicted in June 2007.
 Mr. Coen's first look at 2009 was also somewhat optimistic because he is forecasting a larger gain in ad spending, 3.1 percent.
 ''I don't think 2009 will be a great year,'' Mr. Coen said, ''but the comparisons will be easier'' because of the sluggishness this year.
 Mr. Coen revised downward his estimate for ad spending in the United States last year because, he said, as a percentage of gross domestic product, it fell to 2.02 percent from 2.13 percent in 2006. That was the lowest level since 1981, he added.
 His most recent previous estimate for 2007, made last December, was for a gain of 0.7 percent compared with 2006. The final estimate was for a decline of the same amount, which made 2007 the first year since 2001 in which ad spending fell from the year before.
 ''We thought it was a pretty crummy year,'' Mr. Coen said of 2007, and it turned out ''pretty bad.''
 The change also made 2007 only the sixth year in the last 70, according to Mr. Coen's data, in which ad spending declined from the previous year. The others were 1938, 1942, 1961 and 1991, in addition to 2001.
 Mr. Coen is the senior vice president and forecasting director at Magna in New York, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and has been tracking trends in ad spending for decades. He offers his forecasts twice a year, in June or July and December, updating and revising the numbers each time as more data become available.
 Mr. Coen was joined for the presentation on Tuesday by Brian Wieser, senior vice president and director for industry analysis at Magna. Mr. Wieser focused his remarks on ad-spending trends in emerging media like search-engine marketing, social media and online video.
 Mr. Coen's decision to reduce his estimate for 2008 came a day after Leland Westerfield, a senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, sliced in half his forecast for growth in ad spending this year.
 In a report on Monday, Mr. Westerfield revised his prediction to a gain of 1.8 percent, compared with his previous forecast for an increase of 3.6 percent. He, too, cited slowdowns in ad spending by major marketers in large categories like automobiles and financial services.
 Mr. Westerfield also trimmed a previous estimate he had made for a gain in ad spending for 2009, reducing it to 1.9 percent from 2.7 percent.
 And last week, ZenithOptimedia, a media agency owned by the Publicis Groupe, lowered its forecast for ad spending in major media in North America for the second time in three months.
 The ZenithOptimedia predictions have fallen to an increase of 3.5 percent, from an increase of 4 percent forecast in December, and an increase of 3.7 percent offered in March.
 Although the traditional media are suffering the most problems in selling commercial time and advertising space, Mr. Coen said the pain is not being shared equally.
 National media are faring better than local media, he added, and television networks, both broadcast and cable, are faring better than newspapers and radio.
 Magazines are expected to have an increase of 1 percent in ad revenue compared with 2007, Mr. Coen said, an assessment echoed by a leading executive in magazine ad sales.
 ''We're about flat for the year as we speak,'' the executive, Richard D. Beckman, president at the Conde Nast Media Group in New York, said in an interview on Monday. ''It's not the sort of robust growth we've enjoyed for the last six years.''
 The Conde Nast Media Group is part of the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications, which announced on Monday that it would close one of its magazines, Golf for Women, with the July/August issue.
 Another magazine, Vogue Living, which Conde Nast has been testing with three issues so far, will not publish in the fall, the company said last week, but it may come out in spring 2009.
 Mr. Wieser, in his presentation, forecast robust growth for ad spending in the emerging media. For instance, compared with 2007, he predicted growth of 26.5 percent for search-engine marketing, 60.8 percent for social media and 54.2 percent for online video.
 All those figures, however, come off low bases, Mr. Wieser said, adding that his estimated total for ad spending in the emerging media this year of $15 billion is about 2 percent of the total ad spending in the United States that Mr. Coen foresees.
 That total is $285.1 billion, compared with Mr. Coen's final revised figure of $279.6 billion for 2007. In December, Mr. Coen predicted a total for 2008 of $294.4 billion and a total for 2007 of $283.9 billion.
 Mr. Coen also offered forecasts for ad spending overseas, which he revised upward compared with figures from his previous presentations. That was partly because of changes in exchange rates.
 For 2008, Mr. Coen now predicts ad spending overseas of $382.8 billion, up 6.3 percent from a revised total of $360.1 billion for 2007. His forecast last December was for a gain in ad spending abroad of 5.3 percent.
 The worldwide total for ad spending this year from Mr. Coen is now $667.9 billion, up 4.4 percent from a revised global total of $639.7 billion last year. 
 For 2009, Mr. Coen said, ad spending overseas will grow more slowly than this year, by 4.6 percent to $414 billion, but the growth rate will still exceed that of the United States. 
 The combined worldwide total for ad spending next year from Mr. Coen is $708 billion, adding an estimate of $294 billion for the United States to his estimate of $414 billion for overseas.
 That growth would represent an increase of 4 percent compared with this year and would also be the first year that global ad revenue exceeded $700 billion.

HEADLINE: For Sale in ... Buenos Aires

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA C. McGUIRE

 BODY:
WHAT
 A one-bedroom 462-square-foot furnished pied-a-terre with a balcony and oak floors in the Recoleta neighborhood
 HOW MUCH
 $170,000
 SETTING
 The 12-story building is within easy walking distance of museums, restaurants, and the Patio Bullrich shopping mall. It is two blocks from the historic Recoleta Cemetery.
 INSIDE 
 There is ample built-in storage. The kitchen, decorated in white and stainless steel, is separated from the living room by a high glass table that seats four. In the bedroom, a dark leather headboard matches the dark stain on the closet doors. This apartment was remodeled and redesigned in 2003 by Moira Coupe, a local architect.
 OUTSIDE
 Glass doors open onto a shallow balcony with a view of French-style apartment buildings and trees at the core of the block. The apartment shares a foyer with another apartment, and the building has 24-hour security. The purchase price includes two parking spaces, but most people in Recoleta walk.
 HOW TO GET THERE
 The apartment is 35 minutes by taxi from the international airport, and is also accessible by bus and subway.
 WHO BUYS IN BUENOS AIRES
 Buenos Aires attracts investors and expatriates primarily from the United States and Europe, but also from Asia, Australia and Russia. The city draws retirees seeking an affordable urban cultural experience, and younger professionals looking for the financial freedom to pursue creative careers. Sue Rasmussen, of Reynolds Propiedades and Relocation, says foreigners moving to the area frequently buy a pied-a-terre in the city, and a country house with a vineyard or ocean views. Many apartments in Buenos Aires are owned by investors hoping to cash in on the thriving short-term rental market.
 MARKET OVERVIEW
 The Argentine economy recovered quickly from its 2001 collapse, and the real estate market boomed in the years that followed. Now growth has slowed somewhat. In a 2008 report, the Central Bank of Argentina reported that housing starts grew 15.6 percent in 2006, 5.8 percent in 2007.
 For under $100,000, buyers can find small apartments in new buildings on the edges of the popular neighborhoods of Palermo and Recoleta. Apartments in older buildings with European-influenced architecture are hard to find and more expensive.
 BUYING BASICS
 Although the Central Bank is gradually making qualification requirements more flexible, mortgages are still unusual in Argentina. Financing is scarce, interest rates are high and lenders are leery of foreign buyers. In general, overseas buyers should expect to pay the entire purchase price at closing.
 Buyers will need a tax identification number and an Argentine bank account. There are steep fees to transfer money into Argentina. According to Ms. Rasmussen, these fees can be as much as 2 percent of the amount transferred. 
 The real estate agent receives a commission from both buyer and seller; each pays 3 to 4 percent of the purchase price, as well as a value-added tax that amounts to 21 percent of the commission. The buyer and seller also owe fees to the notary who handles the sale. The buyer's share is 1.7 to 2.5 percent, depending on the notary. 
 The city of Buenos Aires has recently begun requiring foreign buyers to pay a stamp tax equal to 2.5 percent of the purchase price. The seller is responsible for a 1.5 percent transfer tax in cases where capital gains tax is not assessed.
 USEFUL WEB SITES
 Official tourism site of the city of Buenos Aires: www.bue.gov.ar/home/index.php?lang=en
 Federal Administration of Public Revenues site: www.afip.gov.ar/english
 Clarin (newspaper classifieds): www.inmuebles.clarin.com/
 LANGUAGES AND CURRENCY
 Spanish; Argentine peso (1 ARS = $0.33)
 TAXES AND FEES
 Yearly asset taxes, similar to property taxes, are 1.5 percent of the value of the property for foreigners. (Locals pay .75 percent.) 
 Building maintenance fees are $630 per month. The apartment rents for $550 a week, and the two parking spots that come with it each rent for $250 per month. The federal government taxes in-country rental income of nonresidents, and worldwide income of anyone who resides in Argentina.

HEADLINE: Rockwell Re-Enlisted For a Nation's Darker Mood

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: AVENTURA, Fla. 

 BODY:
Elliott Earls's reinterpretation of Norman Rockwell's ''Four Freedoms'' practically screams. A little girl seems to be crying, her eye bruised, with an American flag in the background and two words framing her figure: ''Liberty Weeps.'' The color scheme is red, white and blue, but patriotic pride has been supplanted by sadness. 
 ''She is begging us with her eyes to take responsibility for our actions as a nation,'' Mr. Earls said of his creation in an e-mail message. ''And to live up to the greatness embedded in our social fabric by the brilliance of our founding fathers.''
 Clearly, Rockwell's America this is not. It is Sunday afternoon at the Aventura Mall in South Florida, and I've come to gauge the impact of a handful of images displayed in 14-foot-high posters near Nordstrom. Culled from a surprising new exhibition at the Wolfsonian museum at Florida International University titled ''Thoughts on Democracy,'' they are all artists' responses to Rockwell's wartime ''Four Freedoms'' series. 
 Sixty artists contributed to the show. But their creations bear little resemblance to the Rockwell paintings, which helped raise $133 million for the war effort in 1943 after the government turned them into posters. There is no folksy man standing up to speak his opinion (exemplifying ''Freedom of Speech''), no devout group praying (''Freedom of Worship'') no wholesome family sitting down to a Thanksgiving meal (''Freedom From Want'').
 And while the fourth freedom, ''Freedom From Fear,'' does reappear, the message seems ominous. In Guillermo Kuitca's rendition of Rockwell's image of parents putting their small children to bed, the family is surrounded by a sea of blackness. In James Victore's remake, tears burst from the parents' eyes as they pull an American flag over a wooden coffin.
 What all of this suggests is not just a reinterpretation of Rockwell but a meditation on an American crisis of self-confidence: the sense that trust in American ideals is giving way to fear and uncertainty about how they are exploited. Culture has long been a documentarian of sorts, and this somber mood is also reflected at the box office these days, where the dystopian world of ''Wall-E'' is a hit, and in bookstores, where titles like ''Are You There, Vodka, It's Me, Chelsea'' are best sellers. 
 Many of the artists interviewed said they felt that now was not the time to emphasize American greatness, as Rockwell did, but rather to caution people about the risks of complacency. They said they created the posters because they loved their country -- about two-thirds of the 60 are American -- but felt that their fellow citizens needed to wake up, to break free from anxiety and a habit of looking away. 
 In the mall at least, the artists' instincts seemed to be borne out. In an hour and a half, more than 100 people walked by the exhibit. Only 8 stopped to look. 
 ''People don't care anymore,'' said David Babich, 31, one of the few who lingered, gazing at the prints. ''They aren't as affected by stuff that happens.''
 Rockwell time might not have been entirely different. Nostalgia for World War II has often obscured what the era's most famous war correspondent, Ernie Pyle, once wrote during a visit home: ''A great many people don't know there's a war on, or don't seem to care.'' 
 Rockwell's art, too, has been obscured or whitewashed. His scenes of domestic bliss are far better known than later images like ''The Right to Know'' (1968), which shows a group of Americans clamoring around an empty chair that is meant to signify government bureaucracy during the Vietnam War. 
 Nonetheless, the divide between battlefront and home front seems to be widening. When I returned from Iraq in January, after reporting there for about 18 months on and off, I found myself stunned by the war's lack of impact on people's lives or thoughts. 
 ''OURS ... to fight for.'' That simple phrase sits atop the Rockwell ''Freedom From Want'' and ''Freedom From Fear'' posters. But today, as many returning soldiers have witnessed, that sense of collective responsibility often seems absent, except for the occasional campaign speech. 
 There are no calls to arms among the 80 posters in the Wolfsonian's show. Those that directly tackle the war -- including Mr. Victore's coffin and Helene Silverman's poster of a soldier's face, striped in red and white with the names of other soldiers laid over it -- emphasize the losses. 
 Words like ''ours'' also seem to have disappeared, just as they have from posters on the walls of recruiting offices nationwide and military bases in Iraq. In urging people to sign up or re-enlist, they do not address why ''we'' fight but rather what ''you,'' the average 18-year-old, can get from a job in uniform. 
 That has been the government's pitch for decades. ''Back in 1973 when we made the decision to end conscription, part of the Pentagon's decision was, we're going to compete in the labor market and we're going to work with ideas that get people to work for the armed forces,'' said David R. Segal, a military sociologist at the University of Maryland. ''There was a decision made to downplay values and emphasize economic incentives.'' 
 Not surprisingly, many of the Wolfsonian artists blame the Bush administration for discouraging broad-based sacrifice and starting a war that proved to lack a credible cause. Mr. Victore, an independent designer in New York, who comes from a military family and whose father flew refueling missions over Vietnam, said he had been particularly disillusioned by what he sees as the government's use of fear to drum up support. He said he hoped his poster would remind Americans to raise questions suppressed by anxiety. 
 ''A fearful public is a submissive one, and we willingly -- with no clear cause submitted as reason -- continue into this quagmire,'' he said. 
 Many of the images in ''Thoughts on Democracy'' can also be viewed as a rebuttal of the president's call after Sept. 11 to keep shopping, lest the terrorists win. In Daniel Arsham's gray and white poster, ''WANT'' is a building that towers over everything else. Chip Kidd, a well-known book-jacket designer, produced four posters, with ''Freedom From Want'' appearing above the image of an obese man's stomach.
 The most powerful efforts tackle the tension between the American democratic ideal and its practice. The Map Office, a design studio in New York, produced three unequivocal images. One poster shows democracy as a green goo spread across a pristine landscape; another reads, ''kiss the fist of democracy.'' A third says, ''Democracy is the Helvetica of Politics,'' reflecting its ubiquity, openness and adulteration, the artists said. 
 In some images, government seems to be the problem, a seller of enlightenment ideas that have been so used and reused that their meaning has been diminished. 
 In George Mill's poster, ''FREEDOM'' comes with a disclaimer. ''Certain restrictions apply,'' it says. ''Subject to change without notice. The right of Freedom is made available 'as is' and without warranty of any kind.'' 
 Oh, and one more thing: ''The right of Freedom may be exercised on the strict understanding that neither the Government nor its ministers, employees or agents shall be liable for losses of any kind.''
 A paradox is embedded in this round of cynicism and self-doubt. American ideas likefree markets and democracy are on the march. Poverty has declined, with 18 percent of the world's population living on $1 a day in 2004, down from 40 percent in 1981, as Fareed Zakaria points out in his book ''The Post-American World.'' And a recent poll of 17,000 people in 19 nations by researchers at the University of Maryland found that 85 percent agreed that ''the will of the people should be the basis for the authority of government.'' Tellingly, the most robust support surfaced not in Western democracies but in countries like Ukraine, Nigeria and Indonesia. 
 Even at the Wolfsonian, a handful of posters suggest that the globalization of democracy can be a force for good. In a piece by the Zimbabwean-born artist Chaz Maviyane-Davies, ''We the people'' appears in five languages, including Arabic and Spanish. 
 Why, then, are we so depressed? Perhaps, as the artists' work suggests, because we are no longer so young and naive. The spread of democracy has been messier than Rockwell's generation expected, and better publicized. 
 Iraq is a potent example, but there are so many others. Salvador Orara, a designer at The Map Office, said assassination attempts against his cousins who work in the Filipino government made him realize that American-exported democracy did not necessarily mean security. 
 Mr. Mill recalls coming of age in the former Yugoslavia during the 1980s and believing deeply in freedom and human rights. A decade later, during the Balkan war, he said, ''those values disintegrated before us in the name of 'higher causes.' ''
 In many cases the results feel more like heartbreak than like anger. The emotion in more subtle works, like Richard Tuttle's simple drawing of Uncle Sam hidden behind a wall, reminded me of what I saw in the faces of Iraqis and Americans when things went horribly wrong. It was the marine frustrated by his inability to protect a Sunni ally from assassination; the reporter crushed to discover the lies of an American official; the Iraqi politician saddened by the circus of his country's Parliament.
 Democracy often seems to grow uglier with age. 
 But amid the happy, escapist shoppers at the Aventura mall, these thoughts felt as out of place as Rockwell's proud posters. The sprawling darkness of Mr. Kuitca's remake of ''Freedom of Fear,'' with the original tucked in the corner, seemed far more apt.

HEADLINE: 8 Lower Bids for Starrett City Complex Under Plan to Save Middle-Class Housing

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In a second round of bidding for Starrett City, eight groups submitted bids Tuesday that were substantially lower than a failed $1.3 billion offer made last year for the working- and middle-class enclave on Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn.
 The winner, in all likelihood, will be a nonprofit housing company, rather than the kind of private equity firms and large developers that have purchased block after block of apartment buildings for rapidly rising prices over the last seven years. 
 Acting at the urging of tenant groups fearing the continuing loss of affordable housing, elected officials blocked the sale of Starrett City, which is the nation's largest federally subsidized housing complex. They argued that any buyer paying such a high price would have to cut services and remove longtime residents in favor of higher-paying tenants to make a profit.
 Last month, the owners of Starrett City reached an agreement with federal, state and city officials setting sale terms that all said would ensure that the complex's 5,881 apartments would remain affordable for poor, working- and middle-class families for decades to come. 
 The bidding groups submitted offers ranging from $700 million to $900 million for the 34-year-old complex of 46 brick towers, according to real estate and housing executives involved in the bidding. Starrett City, a racially and economically mixed complex, has its own shopping center, power plant, post office, churches and synagogue.
 Todd Trehubenko, president of Recap Advisors, which is running the sale on behalf of the owners, Starrett City Associates, said he was pleased with the ''opening-round response'' of bids but declined to identify the bidders or their offers. Mr. Trehubenko said his company and the owners planned to narrow the field to three contenders by the end of the month. They hope to sign a sales contract by Sept. 1. 
 According to real estate executives and some of the bidders themselves, the groups have been assembling and reassembling in recent weeks as they put together teams that they hope will be acceptable to the seller and to government officials. Some of the groups bidding on the complex include churches, housing managers, developers and community groups.
 In such bidding, the groups often include a nonprofit entity to function as owner, so the group can issue tax-exempt bonds. Whoever wins the bidding will also have the chance of developing additional housing and shops.
 One group includes L&M Partners, a housing developer in New York, which has allied with Enterprise Preservation Corporation, an affordable housing company; BRP Development; and Goldman Sachs Urban Investment. Another large group includes the Cogsville Group; the Housing Partnership Development Corporation; Aimco, one of the nation's largest apartment complex operators; the Clarett Group; and the Christian Cultural Center, an evangelical church adjacent to Starrett City.
 The NHP Foundation, a nonprofit housing developer that owns 6,000 apartments in New Jersey and Connecticut, is also bidding on the complex, and its partner, the Related Companies, would manage Starrett City. The Rev. Floyd H. Flake's Greater Allen Cathedral Housing Corporation, which has built affordable housing in Queens, has also made an offer, with financial support from JPMorgan Chase.
 ''This is consistent with what we've been doing for the past 20 years: building and maintaining affordable housing,'' said Ghebre Selassie Mehreteab, chief executive of the NHP Foundation. 
 Sen. Charles E. Schumer, who played a pivotal role in stopping the sale last year as well as in writing the new agreement with the owners, said he was happy with the bids so far. 
 ''We are light-years ahead of where we were over a year ago when an oversized and overpriced bid for Starrett City would have changed the development forever and forced thousands of tenants from their homes,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''The good news is that we have a framework in place that will protect the next generation of Starrett City residents and keep this New York City landmark affordable in this sale.''
 The first effort to sell Starrett City occurred during a real estate boom in which the average Manhattan apartment price soared to over $1.5 million and private equity firms acquired 90,000 tenement apartments from Harlem to East New York, while subsidized housing complexes were converted to market-rate housing. 
 State housing officials and Senator Schumer ultimately blocked the sale of Starrett City to David Bistricer, saying the complex had been created with a sizable and continuing public investment. They said they did not want Starrett City Associates to profit enormously from a sale that failed to ensure that the complex would be affordable to construction workers, teachers, firefighters and other moderate-income tenants.
 If the arrangement works, ''It could become a new tool that would be helpful in preserving the scarce stock of aging, affordable housing built with substantial public investments,'' Jerilyn Perine, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, said Tuesday. 
 Bertha Lewis, executive director of New York Acorn, a community organization that has been active at Starrett City, said Tuesday that she hoped the agreement and the sale would lead to a positive outcome. ''We'll be watching,'' she said.

HEADLINE: It's Paradise in a Pit Stop for Cabbies in Queens, and They Fix the Cars, Too

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In a corner of Long Island City known for beat-up auto repair shops and street-side chicken vendors, the newly renovated building that is home to Queens Medallion Brokerage looms like a checkered-yellow palace.
 At its simplest, it is a taxi garage where drivers come to pay their weekly medallion dues and rant about the afternoon's snooty tourists. But step away from the teller's line and cabbies enter -- by garage standards, anyway -- a luxury suite: plasma TVs hanging from the walls, private showers next to the mechanics' floor and soon (the bosses promise), a trio of massage chairs for the lounge.
 ''You'll never see anything like this,'' said Tony Georgiton, a former cabdriver and vice president of the medallion company, as he led a tour of the building on a recent weekday. ''Nowhere else.'' 
 Mr. Georgiton and the company's president, Basil Messados, were used to shabby, single-bathroom garages where grease lined the walls and drivers had to step over transmission parts just to talk to one another. Now, they have created a taxi driver's paradise, a refuge totally unlike the grimy, disheveled hangouts popularized on screen.
 On a shelf in Mr. Messados's office, next to photos of his wife and father, sits a portrait of a huffing-and-puffing Robert De Niro from the classic movie ''Taxi Driver.'' Mr. Messados said that he understood the plight of the hack. In the 1980s, he drove a cab from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. for a weekly income of $152.
 Since then, he has traded in his yellow Ford LTD for a white Mercedes roadster. But he has not forgotten the long and erratic hours, the constant compliance checks from the city, and the sometimes ill-mannered customers. (Don't get him started on the customers.)
 The 32,000-square-foot building in Queens, which opened in April, is intended to alleviate some of those pressures, he said, and add a bit of comfort to what can be a grueling way of life.
 ''A driver needs an island, an oasis, where he can get away and feel like a human,'' Mr. Messados said, putting out a cigarette in an ashtray painted to look like an old-fashioned Checker cab. ''I think it's a big shock when you tell them they can take a shower.''
 Mr. Georgiton, 50, and Mr. Messados, 41, both Greek immigrants, retain a youthful energy that fuels off-color jokes and threats to tear the replica Greek sword off the wall for a lunchtime duel. The two have been business partners for nearly two decades, having set up shop in 1991 with a nine-cab brokerage in Queens.
 They currently lease medallions for about 400 cabs, with two or three drivers using each car. Each driver pays about $800 a week to use the medallion, and some pay more for insurance or to finance their cabs if they do not own them. 
 The garage operates in a 91-year-old former factory that was bought in March for $6.5 million. An additional $1.5 million was spent to turn it into a sparkling, mustard-colored headquarters. It was a decided upgrade from the company's old building a few blocks away.
 ''Someone told me once that you die without pockets -- you can't take anything with you,'' Mr. Georgiton said. ''We cut down on our profits a little, but you feel good about yourself.''
 Many drivers seem to feel pretty good about the new place, too -- when they can make use of it. Queens Medallion has not yet secured permission from the city to run a taxi stand, so cabbies can usually enjoy five or 10 minutes in the lunchroom before parking tickets start to hit windshields in the no-parking zone outside. 
 Drivers stream in and out all day, staying long enough to grab a Coke from the vending machine or catch a few minutes of a soccer game broadcast in high definition. While the lunchroom is popular, the showers rarely flow. 
 Last week, drivers were in and out at lightning speed. Sheik Musa Samory dashed into the lunchroom and spread out his maroon prayer mat. Mr. Musa Samory, who used to pray in a cramped room in the old location, said that when he first saw the new facilities, ''it was like we were on the moon.''
 He said the renovations reflected the caring attitude of the owners, who are known to organize weekly soccer matches and chat amiably with drivers in the lounge. ''This is the way a business place should be,'' said Mr. Musa Samory, a native of Ghana and a cabdriver since 1979. ''Not just for money, but concern for health and to help you be happy.'' 
 But in a time of dreary economic forecasts, others are not so pleased. Chantal Goin questioned the need for fancy facilities when many taxi drivers are struggling to earn enough to pay for expensive gas. 
 ''Why put a shower in?'' Ms. Goin shouted on the way to her cab. ''It doesn't make a difference. All I do is come in here and pay and leave.''
 Hamidou Barry, an immigrant from Mali, said he would have preferred that the money used for renovations go instead toward reducing fees for taxi drivers, like the charge drivers must pay to share a cab. Mr. Barry said he was considering leaving the brokerage because it was getting too expensive. ''This place is good, but they're doing something that's not right,'' he said. ''Charge, charge, charge, charge, charge.''
 Mr. Messados defended the costs, explaining that having multiple drivers share one cab required extra insurance fees. 
 And amid all the frills, there are those who miss the filth. ''It's very nice, said Rashad Javaid, 29, from Pakistan. ''Almost too nice.''
 Mementos of a not-so-luxurious past have not totally vanished. Wander past the TV screens, up the granite staircase, and through the stately bathroom doors. A sign above the shimmering new toilets gently reminds drivers: ''Please Flush Toilet by Hand Only. Do Not Kick to Flush!!!''

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Rise, Led by Computers, Metals and Farm Goods

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Inventories at United States wholesalers increased more than forecast in May, led by rising supplies of computer equipment, metals and farm products.
 But the 0.8 percent gain in the value of stockpiles was lower than the gain in April, which was revised to 1.4 percent, the Commerce Department said Tuesday in Washington. Sales jumped 1.6 percent in May, the same increase as a month earlier. 
 Distributors had enough goods on hand to last 1.08 months at the current sales pace, down from 1.09 the previous month. The decline indicates that companies may be in a good position to withstand a sluggish economy, and may cut back production gradually rather than sharply after the effect of the federal stimulus checks fades.
 ''There isn't an excess supply condition that would be worrisome for the outlook,'' said Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse in New York, whose firm accurately forecast the gain. ''It looks like the wholesale sector is bearing pretty well.''
 Separately, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday that consumer borrowing increased more than forecast in May, rising $7.78 billion, to $2.57 trillion. In April, credit rose by $7.76 billion, previously reported as an increase of $8.9 billion. The Fed's report does not cover borrowing secured by real estate.
 Consumers turned to credit cards to cover their expenses as banks restricted access to home equity lines of credit and other loans. 
 ''Consumer spending was so large in May that consumers used their income tax rebate checks and brought out the plastic as well,'' said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. ''This double-dipping approach cannot keep the consumer afloat forever.''
 Economists forecast wholesale inventories would rise 0.6 percent, according to the median of 35 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Projections ranged from gains of 0.1 percent to 1.1 percent.
 Wholesalers account for about a quarter of all business stockpiles. Factory inventories, which make up about a third of the total, rose 0.6 percent in May, the government said on July 2. Retail stockpiles, which make up the rest, will be included in the business inventories report on Tuesday.
 The seventh consecutive monthly increase in wholesale stockpiles was led by a 1.1 percent rise in the value of farm products and a 2.7 percent gain in metals. Computer equipment gained 3.5 percent in May, after a 0.7 percent increase a month earlier, the report showed.
 One area of concern remained auto dealers, where inventories increased as demand slumped. Auto stockpiles rose 0.1 percent as sales declined 0.1 percent.
 Inventories of durable goods increased 0.8 percent and those of nondurable products climbed 0.7 percent. Petroleum inventories fell 1 percent.
 The decrease in petroleum stockpiles came as sales increased 7.5 percent. The average price of a barrel of crude oil in May rose to $124.91, up from an average of $111.99 in April.

HEADLINE: On the Trail of Consumerism in a Booming Chinese City

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Ted Koppel doesn't actually cover much geographic ground in ''The People's Republic of Capitalism,'' his four-part look at change in China on the Discovery Channel, but he seems a bit like a traveler who has lost his Fodor's. The series ricochets so much -- from big point to factoid to personal story -- that it never does quite figure out where it's going. 
 Yet that doesn't mean it has nothing to offer. The transformation of China, at least in terms of consumerism, into a super-size United States has already been noted and thoroughly commented on, so this effort, an installment of the ''Koppel on Discovery'' series, wasn't destined to be full of fresh insights anyway. But some of the tidbits that Mr. Koppel and his crew unearth as they focus on the booming city of Chongqing, in the southwest, are gems.
 Part 1, on Wednesday night, includes an amusing game of follow the traveling couch as Mr. Koppel illustrates the economic interdependence of China and the United States. An Ethan Allen couch keeps turning up in the segment, in varying stages of completion, with some of the work being done in each country. Where the couch eventually ends up says a lot about both the economic push and pull between the countries and how a former archenemy can become an admirer.
 Part 2, on Thursday, includes a droll visit to some kind of dinner theater where the regimented entertainments and pronouncements from Mao Zedong's day are turned into a kitschy show. ''To many Chinese these days, the Cultural Revolution is better mocked than too carefully remembered,'' Mr. Koppel says.
 And in Part 3, on Friday, about China's aggressive efforts to become a car culture, Mr. Koppel's crew shows a fine eye for detail. Images of China's public-works projects under construction have become familiar, but here the camera catches a woman hauling a bucket of dirt up from a deep hole being dug for a highway infrastructure. Her husband, we are told, is at the other end, filling the bucket -- one couple's back-breaking way of grabbing a piece of prosperity. 
 ''There must be machines that could do this job, but conserving manpower is not China's problem,'' Mr. Koppel explains. ''Putting hundreds of millions of dirt-poor people to work is. Any job that can be done by manual labor, is.''
 Part 4, on Saturday, tries to add more skepticism to the proceedings: political corruption, an overreliance on coal power and other problems are explored. But Mr. Koppel's gee-whiz tone in the earlier segments -- ''How about that?'' and similar interjections crop up -- undercuts any attempt to sell this as hard-hitting reportage. It is what it is, as they say: moderately engaging observational journalism.

HEADLINE: Orchards and Farms May Vanish, but Their Festivals Survive

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: PATTERSON, Calif. 

 BODY:
New York has the Statue of Liberty, and Las Vegas has its inimitable Strip. What Patterson has could be found in a booth run by Boy Scout Troop 8 at the city's Apricot Fiesta, where the Scouts were serving up the last of 111 gallons of homemade apricot ice cream they had mixed at the local fire hall. 
 From the Garlic Festival this month in Gilroy, Calif., which attracts more than 100,000 people, to the small Pear Fair, also this month, in Courtland, Calif., it is the season of the agricultural fair. 
 ''Woolly Bully'' and other oldies, played on the bandstand, set the stage for cuisine like garlic ice cream, ''asparagus in a blanket'' (at the Stockton Asparagus Festival), and artichoke cupcakes with cream cheese frosting (the Castroville Artichoke Festival). ''It tastes just like pumpkin,'' insisted Michele Tottino Pecci, the Artichoke Festival's director.
 The tradition hangs on, even as sprawl swallows up orchards. In Patterson, ''the apricot capital of the world,'' the acreage devoted to apricots is dwindling and farmers blame the influx of dried apricots from Turkey.
 In Gilroy, once the aromatic apogee of garlic, the herb is now grown on only about 500 acres. Half of the garlic sold in the United States now comes from China; most California garlic comes from the Central Valley, near Fresno. 
 But boosters in Gilroy, southeast of San Jose on the fringe of Silicon Valley, point out that the city is home to the country's biggest dehydrator and shipper of garlic -- not to mention the world's biggest garlic festival, where amateur chefs will compete starting July 25 for the top prize of $5,000 and 1,000 pounds of fresh garlic.
 ''No one else has said they want to be the garlic capital,'' said Don Christopher, 73, a founder of the festival. ''So we're it.''
 Beyond the vendors selling funnel cakes and ''Home Is Where Your Harley Is'' T-shirts lies a bit of unsung Americana. Part Chamber of Commerce love fest, part homespun marketing juggernaut, the fairs thrive from Alma, Ga., home of the Georgia Blueberry Festival, to Colfax, La., site of the Louisiana Pecan Festival, to California, the ag-fair mother lode because of its long growing season and diversity of produce.
 At the Apricot Fiesta last month, Joanne Waters, the regional director for a home care agency for the elderly, presided over hundreds of apricot pies, $13 apiece, their latticed tops agleam with topaz glaze.
 ''Unlike the new folks, people who have lived here a long time understand the relationship between farmland and food,'' Ms. Waters said. The pie recipe, perfect for the slightly acidic fruit, came from a local woman whose secrets she refused to divulge. 
 The fiesta began in 1970, when 40 percent of the nation's apricots were grown here, including the prized Patterson variety. Like many other agricultural fairs, it began as a business promotion, and it raised money for a community football stadium, said Ron Swift, 71, a longtime owner of the local newspaper, The Patterson Irrigator. Compared with, say, raisins or prunes, ''apricots have a kind of image of being an aristocratic type of fruit,'' he explained. 
 In Patterson, home to Apricot Avenue as well as Lemon, Pomelo and Prune Avenues, the apricot reigned through the 1980s. In the fiesta's first year, about 7,300 acres of apricots were harvested in Stanislaus County, which includes Patterson; by 2006, the number was down to 5,000.
 The number of orchards continues to shrink, said Bill Ferriera, president of the Apricot Producers of California, pointing out that Turkish apricots account for 95 percent of the dried apricots sold in the United States. 
 At the dock in nearby Stockton, Mr. Ferriera said, dried Turkish apricots sell for $1 to 1.20 a pound, compared with $3.50 for California-grown fruit. The decline of the canning business, the result of American preferences for dried or fresh fruit, has also taken a toll, with many farmers selling out to developers or switching to less labor-intensive crops like almonds. 
 Local teenagers could once rely on a summer job cutting apricots for drying, but ''they no longer have that opportunity,'' said Denise Binga, a Scout mother and sixth-grade teacher who grew up in Patterson.
 Still, the fiesta rolls on, complete with deep-fried apricots (''Only $3.50 -- Yum!!!'' a sign proclaimed) and Boy Scout-made, hand-mixed apricot ice cream that sells out. 
 ''It's about perception,'' said Keith Boggs, the county's deputy executive officer for economic development. ''The skyrocketing cost of gas makes our small-town neighborhoodly roots a draw.'' 
 The ag-fair tradition dates to 1784, when Elkanah Watson, a banker in Pittsfield, Mass., procured a couple of merino sheep and tied them under an elm tree on the public square to entice neighbors to breed them, versus other breeds, said Julie A. Avery, a curator at the Michigan State University Museum and the editor of ''Agricultural Fairs in America: Tradition, Education, Celebration.'' 
 The ploy drew such a crowd that Mr. Watson wrote in his journal, ''If two animals are capable of exciting so much attention, what would be the effect on a larger scale?'' 
 Today's festivals still have an educational component. Each November at the Mountain Mandarin Festival in Auburn, Calif., in the Sierra Nevada foothills, the durability and ''peel-ability'' of the fruit takes center stage with speed-peeling contests and a mandarin toss, but the University of California Cooperative Extension also informs fairgoers of the natural decongestant properties of Owari Satsuma mandarins, which contain synephrine. 
 In Tracy, a far suburb in the Bay Area, the Dry Bean Festival is held every September, beginning with the crowning of the Tracy Bean Queen. Despite sprawl, Tracy is still a ''bean epicenter,'' growing about a third of the nation's baby limas, said Dave Kirsten, a local bean dealer. 
 Nevertheless, there was a recent period when the namesake all but disappeared from the festival, eclipsed by sno-cones, fudge and the ever-popular Spam-carving contest. ''They were getting apathetic about the bean,'' Mr. Kirsten said. 
 Last fall, after an insurrection of sorts, the bean returned in all its glory, with a chili cook-off and tasting pavilions featuring 45 varieties.
 ''The bean is back in its rightful place,'' The Tracy Press declared. ''The people wanted beans, and they are getting them.''

HEADLINE: Australia: Business Confidence Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Australian business confidence fell in June to its lowest level since the 9/11 attacks in the United States as domestic demand slowed and costs continued to rise, according to a survey of companies. National Australia Bank's monthly business index predicted a marked slowdown in Australia's economic growth, with business confidence falling to minus 9 points from minus 4 in May. Overall business conditions fell 7 points from May to zero -- also the lowest since 2001, and 20 points lower than the peak in October 2007. ''Conditions across the nonfarm business sector as a whole deteriorated unexpectedly and significantly in June,'' Jeff Oughton, head of Australian economics at the bank, said in the report. ''This slowdown in conditions appears to have further to run.''

HEADLINE: Latest Plan for Corzine to Consider: Private Lanes on the Turnpike

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

 BODY:
First, Gov. Jon S. Corzine all but offered to lease the New Jersey Turnpike to the highest bidder. Then he floated the bizarre bureaucratic notion of creating a public benefit corporation so the taxpaying public could, essentially, become a private entity and operate the turnpike and other highways (which are now run by a different quasi-public agency). 
 He proposed an 800 percent toll increase to pay for the state's aging roads and draw down half of its more than $30 billion in debt. 
 Now, after all those ideas have been shot down, Mr. Corzine is considering a new prospect for financing critical infrastructure and reducing congestion on the road: Privatize individual lanes. 
 ''It does make you wonder what's next,'' said Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonprofit research organization. 
 On Monday, the State Senate president, Richard J. Codey, a Democrat of Essex County, unveiled his proposal for a private company to build an extension on the turnpike from Exit 8A to Exit 6 and on the Garden State Parkway from Exit 82 down to an exit in the 30s for drivers willing to pay extra to avoid traffic. 
 At the same time, State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat from Union County who is chairman of the Economic Growth Committee, offered his own twist, suggesting that the new lanes be reserved for buses and trucks. 
 Both senators said that the state could not afford a pending $2.7 billion expansion of the turnpike and that bringing in a private company would be the fastest way to raise the money without increasing tolls or taxes.
 ''The money has to come from somewhere, and to me this seems the best way to do it,'' Senator Lesniak said. ''It's like magic.''
 Governor Corzine said both ideas were ''worthy of examination'' on Tuesday. The governor was in Perth Amboy, signing the so-called family care bill mandating insurance coverage for children.
 ''We're looking at a whole host of alternatives, and we have an absolute need to come together with a plan,'' he said, when asked about the lane proposals.
 Since Mr. Corzine first flirted with leasing the highways, which he publicly discussed this year, the various proposals have prompted public outcry, and the latest iteration is no different. Many drivers, their advocates, and elected officials have reservations about creating private lanes even if they could help pay for road repairs and repay the state's burdensome debt.
 ''This certainly is creative, but in the long run it probably isn't a good idea,'' Stephen G. Carrellas, coordinator of the New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association, said in an interview on Tuesday.
 While similar plans have been tried in California, Indiana and Illinois, analysts say they are fraught with problems that could also happen in New Jersey. For example, if individual lanes are privately owned, it would be in the owners' interest to keep the public lanes slower than theirs, so they might try to put speed limits or other regulations in the contract. 
 ''The more congested the general purpose lanes, the better the value of the franchise of the express lanes,'' said Jonathan R. Peters, associate professor of finance at the College of Staten Island. 
 But others said that such a system would simply be of benefit to the wealthy.
 ''The turnpike is for everybody, and I'm not sure I want to have lanes that are just for rich people and other lanes that are just for ordinary folks,'' said Peter Humphreys, a spokesman for Save Our Assets N.J., a community organization started last year to monitor the various road proposals.
 And some are just philosophically opposed to the state's selling off of assets. Matthew Wright, president of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association, likened the turnpike proposal to auctioning police stations or fire departments.
 ''You shouldn't lose control of your roads either,'' he said.
 According to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which operates the highways, trucks make up 13 percent of all traffic on the turnpike, but pay 33 percent of all tolls because vehicles are charged per axle. A new report from the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy shows that 9.5 percent of the state's private employment and 11 percent of its gross domestic product comes from trucking and warehousing. 
 ''My concern is, if you turn over an entity like this to a private party, you might have unintended consequences of tolls going higher than we might want, and it might affect our most robust industry,'' said Martin E. Robins, a senior fellow at the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. 
 Senator Codey said toll rates would be established by the state as part of the bidding process.
 ''We would dictate the price of tolls out of the box and dictate what they will be in the future before they get the job,'' he said.
 Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, a Democrat from Middlesex County who is chairman of the Transportation and Public Works Committee, said that he was open to the idea of a premium toll lane. However, he said the Turnpike Authority should construct it so the money would go to the state rather than to a private entity.
 ''The Turnpike Authority should be doing it themselves, because they don't have to build in a profit margin,'' he said.
