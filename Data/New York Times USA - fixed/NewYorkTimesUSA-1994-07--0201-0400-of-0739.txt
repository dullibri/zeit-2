HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NAPLES: THE OUTLOOK;
Playing Field Is Altered But U.S. Is Still a Player

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAPLES, July 8

 BODY:
President Clinton's trip to Europe and the conference of seven major industrial democracies that began here today show European leaders how far they still have to go, five years after the cold war ended, to solve the security and economic problems that followed it.
From the European point of view, the President's role is crucial. Without clear American leadership and commitment, the West can neither redefine relations with Russia and the Eastern European countries the Soviet Union used to dominate, nor redefine the institutions needed to insure lasting stability from the Atlantic to the Urals in the new era. 
 Those are the broadest purposes of the President's trip and of the annual summit meeting of the so-called Group of Seven, which for the first time will include President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia as a full participant in the political part of the gathering, which will begin Saturday night after the economic discussions end.
 
Jobs a Major Priority
 Mr. Yeltsin is not participating in the economic talks, which the Europeans would like to center on jobs and the lack of them in Western Europe, where 11 percent of the work force is now unemployed.
The problem could become even more acute as low-wage Eastern European countries make the transition to market economies and increase their exports of cheap manufactured goods, because Western Europe's welfare-state economies make labor too expensive to be competitive.
"Unemployment is the central problem of our economies, and has become the main problem of the G-7," said a high-ranking aide to President Francois Mitterrand of France. "If we do not solve it, we risk shaking the foundations of our entire economic system."
With many Western European leaders in weak domestic political positions or facing elections within the next year, few are eager to tell voters that things like six weeks of vacation every year, and 35-hour weeks, may have to be changed as their neighbors to the east begin to compete with them economically.
 
Clinton Seen as Weak
 Yet unemployment is only one of the problems that has to be solved in the post-cold-war economic framework. Many European officials regard Mr. Clinton's foreign policy team as a weak one and think the President's attention to European issues like the war in Bosnia has been intermittent at best. But it is the American President who laid down what Western strategy there is for bringing Russia and Eastern Europe into the global market economy and guaranteeing the peace and security of the entire region at the same time.
The challenge facing Western leaders is as critical as the one that faced them 50 years ago, but their response has been far more sketchy and tentative than it was then.
Five years after the Berlin Wall collapsed, there has been no grand design to cope with the social unrest of remaking the communist economies, the ethnic strains of resurgent nationalism in Eastern Europe or the increasingly competitive pressures of the global economy.
 
No Grand Plan
 Instead the leaders of the Group of Seven, NATO and the European Union have improvised and tinkered at gatherings like this one, which promises to be as inconclusive as those before it.
Last year in Tokyo, they offered a $46 billion package of aid and debt rescheduling help to stabilize Russia's inflation-ridden economy and encourage it to keep privatizing state enterprises, which still account for 60 percent of its gross national product. About $30 billion has been committed so far, according to economists.
Last January in Brussels, Mr. Clinton and the NATO allies agreed to offer a "Partnership for Peace" between the alliance and any formerly Communist country that wanted to cooperate, a step that disappointed Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and other countries worried about Russia and wanting the security guarantees that come with full membership. Mr. Yeltsin's Government, which opposes NATO expansion, took until last month to agree to participate, and smaller countries fear the Russians want to use the partnership only to keep them from getting in.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany also wants early membership in both for Poland and other Eastern European countries as soon as they qualify, because Germany cannot long tolerate a security vacuum on its eastern border.
American diplomats say that the German concerns will be on Mr. Clinton's mind when he visits Bonn and Berlin after the discussions here end on Sunday, and that the President will repeat his assurances that expansion of NATO would not be a threat to Russia when he sees Mr. Yeltsin.

HEADLINE: 30-Year Bond Rate Is Highest Since Clinton Was Elected

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates rose yesterday to their highest level since just after President Clinton was elected, as the bond market sold off in the wake of a June employment report that was much stronger than expected.
The Labor Department said the 379,000 rise in payroll employment reported for June might have overstated the growth by as many as 100,000 jobs. But analysts said the figures, coupled with upward revisions in the number of jobs created in April and May, were consistent with an economy showing considerable momentum. 
 In order to slow growth to a more sustainable pace, and thus keep inflation in check, analysts said the Federal Reserve Board would probably push up short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year.
"The numbers were undeniably strong," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "Even though the employment data and anything else that happened in June was too close to previous Fed moves to have had any impact, I don't think the markets will give the Fed the luxury of waiting much longer" to raise interest rates again.
And Paul Mastroddi, a managing director at J. P. Morgan & Company, said, "The employment numbers make us more confident that the economy is exhibiting extreme cyclical strength."
Morgan economists, who have been issuing economic growth forecasts far above consensus estimates for much of the year, are projecting that gross domestic product expanded at a 5 percent rate in the second quarter, well above the 2.5 percent to 3 percent rate the Fed has said is sustainable without pushing up inflation.
The Fed made its last move in early May, pushing up the Federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks, the interest rate it most closely controls, continuing a tightening process that began in early February.
 
No Move by Fed
 Earlier this week, the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met to consider whether the Federal funds rate should be raised again. No decision was reached at that time, and the Fed did nothing yesterday to indicate it had raised the funds rate, which currently is at 4.25 percent.
The effect of the employment report was reflected across the yield curve, but the biggest move in rates was seen in long-term notes and bonds, whose yields are particularly sensitive to shifts in inflation expectations.
By late yesterday, the Treasury's benchmark 6 1/4 percent 30-year bonds were offered at a price of 83 3/8, down more than 3/4 point, or more than $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount of bonds. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, jumped to 7.69 percent, from 7.60 percent on Thursday.
At 7.69 percent, the 30-year bond is at its highest yield since Nov. 9, 1992, when bond yields stood at 7.74 percent.
Despite the surprisingly strong employment report, bond market traders and analysts said trading activity was fairly light yesterday. They added that the price drop would have been even more severe if the Fed had not already taken the steps it had, and that if belief it would do more was not so well entrenched.
"If we had gotten this number three months ago, we would have been hit much harder," one government-bond trader said. "Now, with real rates where they are, there is some buying. We might be due for one more wash-out, but we are getting to rate levels, particularly at the long end, where things are looking attractive."
Traders of medium- and short-term Treasury notes and Treasury bills took one look at the employment numbers and began selling securities, pushing prices to levels that would produce yields that analysts said would be consistent with a funds rate at least one-quarter, and perhaps as much as half a percentage point above its current level.
By late in the day, for example, the 6 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at a price of 98 7/8, down more than half a point, to yield 7.02 percent. Two-year note prices fell by 1/4 point, to 9919/32 , to yield 6.22 percent. And rates on one-year Treasury bills rose by 11 basis points, to an offered rate of 5.24 percent.
In other fixed-income market activity, corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond prices sagged in sympathy with the decline in Treasury issues.

HEADLINE: Regional Data on Jobs May Hide Some Gains

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
The numbers may not tell the whole story about the regional economy. The Government's latest unemployment statistics, released yesterday, showed that the jobless rates for New York City, New York State and New Jersey remained higher than the national rate.
But Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, said, "Fundamentally, the region is coming around after a long time in the wilderness." 
 In New York City, for example, the unemployment rate for June was 8.5 percent, compared with 8.4 percent in May. In New York State, the rate was 7 percent, up from 6.5 percent in May. And in New Jersey, the rate was 7.1 percent, up from 6.9 percent in May. The national rate is 6 percent.
 
 
 
A Trend Continues
 "We're seeing the unemployment rates for the past two months are the lowest this year, and the employment figures are the highest," Mr. Ehrenhalt said, referring to the New York City figures. The Government's statistics showed that 2.97 million people were employed in New York City in June, unchanged from May.
"So, the new data that we're getting now don't move onto a new path," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. "They're numbers that are significant as a confirmation that this is an economy on the mend -- slowly and incrementally, but on the mend."
Mr. Ehrenhalt said the gap between the national unemployment rate and the metropolitan area rates indicated the region's relative economic weakness.
And that, he said, "reflects the continuing restructuring of many of the region's key industries, such as the business services -- public relations, management consulting, legal services -- as well as such financial services as banking."
He added: "And then, of course, there is another factor, a demographic factor. We're not seeing the kind of population growth we're seeing in the West and Southern part of the United States."
 
 
 
More People at Work
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 8 million people were working in New York State in June, up from 7.97 million in May. In New Jersey, 3.72 million were at work, compared with 3.66 million in May.
In New York City, 276,000 people were looking for work in June, compared with 272,000 in May. In New York State, the comparable figures were 601,000 seeking work in June and 554,000 in May, and in New Jersey 284,000 in June and 272,000 in May. Statistics for Connecticut will not be available for a few weeks, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said that in New York City "manufacturing, which has been a long-term source of severe job loss in good times and bad times alike, has seen some relative stability in jobs since late last year." He added, "The hemorrhaging has really, for the most part, stopped."
That, he said, was also largely true in the region. "New Jersey has been showing more strength than New York when you look at the path of recovery," he said. "New Jersey has recovered more of the jobs lost over the recessionary period of the last two or three years."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
A Good Time to Turn Paper Losses Into Tax Benefits

BYLINE: By Andree Brooks 

 BODY:
The first half of the year has left investors sitting on paper losses in bonds, stocks and mutual funds of all types. Many are justifiably proud that they have not panicked and sold in the declining market.
But a short-term maneuver is worth consideration: selling an investment that has declined in value to lock in a loss for tax purposes. In many cases, this can be done without disturbing long-term goals by turning around and buying the same securities or something comparable. And in the case of the increasingly popular no-load mutual funds, there are no transaction costs. 
 Normally, such sales are done during a year-end portfolio review. Given the sharp declines in the first half, however, there is no time like the present. If the market sweeps back up by the end of the year, the opportunity will be lost.
The securities must be sold and not repurchased for 30 days to count as a loss with the Internal Revenue Service. After that time, an investor can repurchase the shares, if so desired, keeping his long-term portfolio intact.
Say you put $10,000 into the Fidelity Southeast Asia Fund when its sales charge was waived on Jan. 1. By the end of the first half, that stake would have fallen to $7,690, for a loss of $2,310. If the stake is sold and the loss used to offset a long-term capital gain taxed at 28 percent, the loss would reduce your 1994 tax bill by $647.
 If you are holding some investments that have done quite nicely for the last few years, you could then liquidate them any time this year with a smaller tax bite.
 "It's a popular way to get around paying capital gains," said George Benigno, a research analyst with the Institute for Econometric Research in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., publishers of investment newsletters.
Capital gains are not the only taxes that can be lowered, said James DeJesus, a tax partner in the New York office of Deloitte & Touche. Up to $3,000 of investment losses can be used to offset ordinary income if someone does not have capital gains. Any losses of more than $3,000 could be carried forward to future years.
Investors may balk at using such tax strategies on individual securities because the commissions on sales and subsequent purchases could substantially reduce the benefits. But for the millions of people who own no-load mutual funds, commission charges are no deterrent. They just have to make sure not to violate fund company rules on the number of exchanges permitted each year.
People worried about sitting on cash for 30 days -- for fear it could mean jumping back in to an investment at a higher price -- have several alternatives. If they have extra cash sitting in a money market account, the Institute for Econometric Research recommends doubling up on the original investment just before making the sale. Then when selling, they should specify in writing which shares are being sold, when the shares were purchased and what price was paid.
Another approach is to use sale proceeds immediately to buy shares in a fund that is almost identical. Eric Kobren, editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent monthly newsletter about Fidelity funds, suggests swapping shares in Fidelity's Spartan Government Income Fund for its Government Securities Fund.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Drops Sharply On Clinton Remarks in Italy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday, hitting a 19-month low against the German mark and nearing its record low against the Japanese yen, after President Clinton suggested that there was not much his Administration could do in the short term to bolster the American currency.
Blaming "macroeconomics" and Japan's $60 billion annual trade surplus with the United States for the dollar's weakness, the President said that "over the long term, economic fundamentals will work themselves out." 
 Many traders interpreted the President's comments to mean that the White House was not greatly concerned about the dollar, which has fallen 10 percent against the mark and 12 percent against the yen so far this year.
"These comments were intended to be benign, but they came across as benign neglect instead," said Dennis Pettit, foreign-exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
In New York trading, just after Mr. Clinton spoke, the dollar fell as low as 1.5588 marks, its lowest level since December 1992. It ended the day at 1.5617 marks, down from 1.5732 marks on Thursday.
The dollar also traded as low as 97.77 yen, just above its post-World War II low of 97.73 yen, set July 1. It ended at 98.10 yen, down from 98.60.
Mr. Clinton also said concerted efforts by the United States and its allies to prop up the dollar during the last two months had produced only mixed results. "We have participated in interventions," he said. "Sometimes they work for a little bit and sometimes they don't."
Later, a senior Administration official with the President, who was in Naples for the Group of Seven summit meeting, said the United States remained prepared to cooperate with other countries to support the dollar and did not rule out further intervention in the currency markets.
Still, "Clinton put another nail in the dollar's coffin," said Albert Soria, foreign-exchange manager at Kansallis Osake Pankki, a Finnish bank in New York.
The President's linkage of the weak dollar with the American trade deficit with Japan prompted dollar selling by traders who interpreted it as an endorsement of a strong yen -- even though Mr. Clinton insisted that "we have not talked down the dollar."
Mr. Clinton and his aides last year said a strong yen would curb Japan's surplus by making the country's exports more expensive.
But the President's latest comment "shows a subtle acceptance of the dollar's decline against the yen," Mr. Soria said. If Mr. Clinton wants the dollar to recover, "he shouldn't say anything."
The dollar started falling in early New York trading after a bigger-than-expected rise in employment in June raised concerns about inflation, driving Treasury bonds lower. Currency traders watch bonds closely for signs that international investors are selling dollar-denominated securities.

HEADLINE: Last Fed Rate Rise Was Unanimous

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Officials of the Federal Reserve voted unanimously at their May 17 policy meeting to increase short-term interest rates out of growing concerns that the economy's strength was leading to inflation, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
The minutes offered no surprises, but fleshed out the Fed's determination to push up interest rates to levels that it felt would neither stimulate nor retard the economy. 
 "All the members agreed that a further tightening action was needed at this point," according to a summary released today of the May meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
The committee also considered the impact of higher short-term rates on financial markets, but concluded they "appeared to be in a much better position to absorb needed policy adjustments," the summary said.
The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10 to 0 to raise from 3.75 percent to 4.25 percent its target for the Federal funds rate -- what banks charge each other for overnight loans.
The Fed also pushed up the discount rate -- the interest it charges member banks -- from 3 percent to 3.5 percent.
One unidentified member expressed concern that raising the Federal funds rate and the discount rate by the same amount might unintentionally send a sign that the Fed would not soon raise rates again.
But the members eventually agreed that the dual action did not rule out a subsequent increase before they held their next meeting this week. The policy makers concluded the two-day meeting on Wednesday without increasing interest rates again.
 
 
An Unmistakable Signal
 The twin increases on May 17, which led to a rally in the stock and bond markets, have been the Fed's sharpest signal this year of its determination to fight inflation. They came at a time when the economy, after a booming expansion in the closing months of 1993, continued to grow at a healthy clip.
The increase in the Federal funds rate was the fourth this year, reversing a five-year trend of easing credit to stimulate the economy out of recession and slow growth.
"The stimulative effects of an expansionary monetary policy had become increasingly apparent -- especially in business purchases of capital equipment and consumer spending on housing, motor vehicles and other consumer durables," the summary said.
The Federal Open Market Committee includes members of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and five presidents of the Fed's regional banks. Its meetings are in private and the summaries are usually made public about six weeks later.

HEADLINE: Needed: Steady Hands on Haiti

 BODY:
By abruptly reneging on the plan to provide safe haven to 10,000 Haitian refugees, Panama embarrasses the Clinton Administration. But it raises no substantive roadblock to America's latest policy of providing sanctuary for Haitian refugees while excluding them from the United States.
Washington is already hard at work replacing the 10,000 slots lost in Panama with commitments from other countries, some as far afield as West Africa. This frantic search helps meet a desperate humanitarian need, but there can be no mistaking that a policy that diverts black Haitians while welcoming mostly white refugees from other troubled nations reeks of racial discrimination. 
 And when the Administration is publicly humiliated by a Latin leader as indebted to Washington as Panama's President, Guillermo Endara, who was installed by U.S. troops in 1989, it is a sign that U.S. credibility in the region has sunk to an alarming new low. If even Mr. Endara has no compunctions about thumbing his nose at the U.S. and walking away from diplomatic understandings, what is to be expected of Gen. Raoul Cedras and his sneering cronies in Haiti's junta?
The Panama fiasco adds to the impression of an Administration daily lurching this way and that over Haiti. In this week alone there were two big shifts in refugee policy. On Tuesday the Administration announced that all boat people would be denied entry to the U.S. and that only those meeting strict criteria for asylum would be offered safe havens elsewhere. A day later, under pressure from human rights groups, came the significant amendment that virtually all boat people who requested safe haven outside the U.S. would get it.
There were also calculated Pentagon disclosures of naval deployments and practice invasions. Meanwhile there is the sanctions policy, which can only succeed if pursued with patience and steady purpose. If the master strategy is to keep everyone off balance, not knowing what to expect next, it is a smashing success. Unfortunately, the American people, whose support will be needed for any long-range diplomatic or military commitments, are by now as confused as everyone else.
The way to reassure Americans, rally Latin allies and get through to the Cedras gang is to settle down with a sustainable, consistent policy. Several elements of such a policy are now taking shape. But itchy-finger military moves risk snatching disaster from the jaws of creditable crisis management.
Refugee policy at last seems to be on a minimally humanitarian course, though it is still tainted with a double standard. Tough economic sanctions are in place and are being more rigorously enforced. Planning is under way for the international community to help maintain tranquillity once President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns. The idea is to deploy a large multinational force that could inhibit revenge killings and enforce good behavior on the existing military while a less gangsterish army and police force is organized and trained.
Put these elements together: safe havens are provided for the innocent while sanctions press business and army leaders to demand the departure of the Cedras group. After they go, President Aristide invites international help to promote reconciliation and train Haitians in the new responsibilities of constitutional law enforcement and national defense. It could work.
Add a U.S. invasion and the elements begin to fall apart, with nationalist Haitians, left and right, uniting against Washington and Latin nations pressured by their peoples to back off from sheltering refugees and contributing to a multinational force.
With the point now made that Washington has troops trained to invade, the threat of using those troops should be held off the immediate agenda. One steady policy will work better than two new contradictory ones every day.

HEADLINE: Bankers' Gold Won't Feed African Babies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Does it really matter that Africa's share of world trade has fallen to 2 percent? Or that per capita income is declining at 2 percent a year? 
 To economists, yes, it does. But to African families it is of more importance to have food, clothing and shelter at a fundamental level and medical care and education at a secondary level. These basic human needs should not be bargained away for a stable currency, for economic statistics that lure foreign investment.
Africa needs a large dose of what
Oxfam and related groups try to do: help Africans develop local resources with small infusions of capital for tools appropriate to their environment; help them grow the foods they want to eat and that nourish them (not the foods I want to buy in my supermarket), and help individuals develop personal skills. The spirit of free enterprise must start locally and grow from wealth nurtured within the community. In any case, that is how we did it in the United States.
Increased production of gold in Ghana may warm the hearts of world bankers with no personal experience of deprivation. Gold does not feed babies who will wither and die waiting for that magic economic climate that attracts foreign investment.
And when that investment and high technology arrive, will Africans be better off? Their statistics may well be. But will high tech give them jobs? Will individual families have better food, clothing, shelter, education and medical care?
Let's find a way of getting down to basics, some way of measuring statistically real human well-being before we impose more huge capital outlays on others.

WALT IN WONDERLAND
The Silent Films of Walt Disney.
By Russell Merritt
and J. B. Kaufman.
Illustrated. 164 pp. Baltimore:
Le Giornate del Cinema Muto/
The Johns Hopkins
University Press.
$39.95. 
THE famous part of Walt Disney's extraordinary career began in 1928 with a Mickey Mouse cartoon titled "Steamboat Willie." The film's tightly synchronized soundtrack combined with the spunky performance of the cartoon rodent established Disney as an innovator in animated films; it also popularized soundtracks for cartoons as decisively as "The Jazz Singer" had done for live-action films the year before.
But "Steamboat Willie" capped eight years of struggle by Disney to make his way in the rough-and-tumble, highly competitive world of film animation. He tenaciously survived bankruptcy, broken promises and betrayals regarding money, contracts, employees and character ownership -- even Mickey Mouse was invented as a replacement for a rabbit look-alike named Oswald to which a wily distributor laid claim.
Disney's little-known but crucially formative period in animation is the subject of "Walt in Wonderland," a scholarly and entertaining book that is a combination of film critique, studio history and oral history illustrated with wonderful original animation drawings, storyboards and rare photos. Because we are dazzled by Disney's later works, his silent films have, until now, been paid far less attention. But the animation historians Russell Merritt and J. B. Kaufman make clear that Disney's roles as public figure, entrepreneur, entertainer and purveyor of Middle American values and mores "find their origins in a single source: the ambitious young man who struggled to establish his first animation studio in the 1920's."
In 1920, the 19-year-old Disney was employed as a commercial artist at the Kansas City Film Ad Company when he began experimenting with animation on his own time. Singlehandedly he produced a series of cartoon fillers about local happenings ("Newman Laugh-O-Grams") that were shown with newsreels in the Newman theater chain. He learned animation from a book published that year -- "Animated Cartoons: How They Are Made, Their Origin and Development," a guide that emphasized formulas and labor-saving tricks of the trade. Disney also scrutinized films made by the top animation producers of the day: Paul Terry ("Aesop's Fables"), Pat Sullivan ("Felix the Cat"), Bill Nolan ("Krazy Kat") and Max and Dave Fleischer ("Out of the Inkwell").
Disney's ambition and drive were apparent from the start, according to Mr. Merritt and Mr. Kaufman. By 1921 Disney had quit his job to produce a series of animated fairy tales (including "Little Red Riding Hood," "Cinderella" and "Puss in Boots") in his own studio, Laugh-O-Gram, which he had staffed with Kansas City youngsters whom he taught animation. (Several of his trainees would later make important contributions to animation, including Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising, who together founded the cartoon studios at both Warner Brothers and MGM, and the estimable Ubbe Iwerks, who designed Mickey Mouse and later created the special effects for "Mary Poppins" and "The Birds."
The years 1921-24 marked the emergence of Disney the director and storyteller and the demise of Disney the animator, who, the authors tell us, eventually quit drawing altogether. But Disney's inexperience as an entrepreneur led to the bankruptcy of his Kansas City studio. And in 1923 he went to Hollywood to begin writing and directing the "Alice" comedies, a series of more than 50 shorts featuring a live-action little girl in a cartoon world.
Mr. Merritt and Mr. Kaufman point out that the "Alice" shorts Disney directed in Hollywood and the six fairy tales he directed in Kansas City revealed themes, gags and visual motifs that he would recycle again and again in later films and even in theme parks. For example, in "Puss in Boots" (1922) Disney combines his love of farm and barnyard humor with his passion for royalty and pageantry, and he has the king of Kingville living in a castle on Main Street near a movie theater in a small Midwestern town -- a precursor to similarly incongruous settings at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
THE authors note another Disney motif that made its way from his earliest films all the way into "Fantasia" (1940): music as a lively expression of misbehavior. Even though Disney's early films were silent, characters could often be found dancing on musical notes, and mundane objects would often be metamorphosed into musical instruments -- towels becoming piano rolls, tails turning into violins.
Despite these tricks, the authors maintain that Disney did not so much lead his competitors as follow them. His gags were better organized than theirs and he strove for more detail and nicer drawings, but he learned his craft by imitating the formula stories, graphics and humor of his peers. For example, his first animal character with a name, Julius the Cat, is a blatant clone of Felix the Cat -- from the rubber-hose-and-circle design to the detachable body parts.
Disney was so eager to please his demanding distributors and gain economic stability that he fell victim to what Mr. Merritt and Mr. Kaufman call "the tyranny of the gag." He filled his films with continuous slapstick routines that "sharply restricted narrative development and characterization." For this reason, the authors maintain, Disney the mythologist and symbolist is nowhere to be seen in the silents.
Only when Disney invented Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in 1927 did he begin to explore the concept of "personality animation," in which cartoon characters are defined as individuals not just by their design but by their movements, mannerisms and acting. As Disney put it at the time: "I want the characters to be somebody. I don't want them just to be a drawing."
Building on the work of predecessors in this special area -- Winsor McCay, who created Gertie the Dinosaur in 1914, and Otto Messmer, who directed the "Felix the Cat" series throughout the 1920's -- Disney eventually made his greatest contribution to the art of animation: the development of personality animation in its most subtle and powerful form, which culminated, in 1937, in "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
But first there was Oswald. To make his Oswald cartoons look "real," Disney turned away from the magical world of Felix the Cat, Koko the Clown and Krazy Kat and started emulating the camera angles, effects and editing of live-action films. He studied Laurel and Hardy, Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplin and especially Buster Keaton to learn how to base gags on personality and how to build comic routines, rather than piling one gag on top of another. And by scrutinizing the shadow effects, cross-cutting and staging of action in films starring Douglas Fairbanks and Lon Chaney, Disney learned how to stir emotion in an audience.
I recall an unexpectedly affecting scene in "Great Guns," a 1927 cartoon that flutters between humor and poignancy and that hints of things to come in Disney's later work: Oswald the Rabbit, about to leave for Army service, gives his girlfriend a series of heartfelt goodbye kisses that, comically, go on and on. Slowly, the surrounding living room dissolves into a foxhole in the midst of a heated battle, with rockets bursting all around. His girlfriend simultaneously dissolves into a photograph of herself, which the oblivious and lovesick Oswald continues to kiss, until a bomb pierces and destroys it.
The decision to bestow feelings on his characters and to use situational humor led to a significant "darkening of Disney's world," the authors say. Disney replaced the old free-form magical animation -- in which cartoon characters and their unreal bodies always bounce back to life after disasters -- with characters who use their bodies to explore pleasure and pain. Their behavior seemed to have moral implications, which Disney exploited in the anarchic Mickey Mouse cartoons, in the "Silly Symphonies" series and then in his feature-length cartoons.
Even though 57 years separate "The Lion King" from "Snow White," these two films are remarkably similar. Both express powerful and believable emotions by imitating the techniques of live-action movies; both show a fascination with animals, pageantry, hierarchical society, immortality, marriage, romance and transcendence. As "Walt in Wonderland" makes clear, once Disney discovered personality animation, his transformation was permanent and quick. The distance between an audience bemused by Oswald's bittersweet farewell and an audience weeping in sincere sympathy with seven cartoon dwarfs mourning a dead cartoon princess was less than a decade.

BYLINE: By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE; Benedict Nightingale is the chief theater critic for The Times of London.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
SO YOU THOUGHT THE debate about the corrupting effects of the violence on film, video and television was confined to the United States? Not at all. It is preoccupying the British as never before, and the result will presumably be the toughening of already toughish laws. To see why, consider the following cases.
* In Liverpool, in what is now one of the most notorious murders in British history, 2-year-old Jamie Bulger was abducted from a shopping mall in Liverpool by two 10-year-old boys, led to a railroad line, hammered to death with an iron bar, then cut in half by a train. There were suggestions that a horror film about a demonic doll, "Child's Play 3," helped inspire the crime.. No evidence was presented that either boy had seen it, but the father of one had rented it shortly before. 
 * A gang in Manchester tortured a 16-year-old girl, set her afire and left her dying. One of the sadists repeated the menacing "Child's Play 3" catch phrase "I'm Chucky -- wanna play?"
* Four hooligans in Cardiff turned on a middle-aged man who had remonstrated with them for vandalizing a traffic barrier, and stomped him to death. As they did so, one repeatedly yelled a line, "I've got the juice," from the movie "Juice," in which a shopkeeper is murdered for trying to enforce law and order.
The murder of Jamie Bulger, which went to trial in November, did not merely sicken the nation's conscience. It stirred the Government and Parliament to action. Now Britain, which imposes stronger restrictions on films than any other Western country, is tightening the screws still further.
Last year, after the Bulger murder, Prime Minister John Major called on parents to keep a closer eye on their children's viewing. In July both the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Independent Television Commission, which regulates Britain's commercial channels, issued new guidelines urging producers to be much more cautious.
That was not enough for some 220 members of Parliament, who said they would vote for a proposed law banning any video that contained "degrading or gratuitously violent scenes liable to cause psychological damage to a child" or presented children with "inappropriate role models."
The Government at first opposed the bill, arguing that the phrasing was so broad that it could be used to ban everything from "Schindler's List" to "Snow White." But, fearing defeat in the House of Commons, the Government reached a compromise with the bill's sponsors. The Government is now itself sponsoring legislation aimed at stemming the flow of violent videos, softening their content and keeping them away from children.
British restrictions on film, video and television were already fairly tight. The categories of the British Board of Film Classification, which are officially enforceable, are similar to those in the United States. They are U (universal), Uc (especially suitable for children), PG (parental guidance may be needed) and 12, 15 and 18 (nobody under those ages may see the movie or rent the video). But they have always been more sternly imposed than the standards of the Motion Picture Association of America. And they are imposed most often on American movies. The censors seem less inclined to fret over sexual content than their American counterparts -- nudity is not uncommon on British television -- but what the board calls America's tolerance for violence causes it more problems than anything else. The board's annual report says even family movies from the United States routinely contain effects -- "blood spurts, neck breaks, head butts, eye gouges, snapping of arms or legs, kicks to the head or groin" -- that desensitize the young or treat violence as an acceptable solution to life's problems.
Accordingly, the opening of "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," in which Kevin Costner is tortured by Saracens, was one of two scenes pruned before the film got a PG rating. "Terminator 2" was heavily chopped before it was passed for those aged 15 and up. The board came close to denying even an 18 certificate to "Robocop 2," given its "moments of sadistic cruelty to real, suffering people," and awarded it only after several cuts were made. Advertisements for "Jurassic Park," which has a PG certificate, must warn that it may disturb young or sensitive children.
The board applies harsher standards to videos, knowing that children more easily evade the age restrictions with them. Category 12 automatically becomes category 15 when a movie is transposed to cassette. Kevin Costner was tortured still less graphically as Robin Hood on video. There were more cuts in "Terminator 2," mostly of Arnold Schwarzenegger kneecapping his victims, which in Britain is a practice associated with the Irish Republican Army. Even the schoolroom Schwarzeneggering in "Kindergarten Cop" was toned down before 12-year-olds could see it in theaters and 15-year-olds rent it.
Since the Bulger murder, things have toughened up. Several videos have been denied any classification at all while the Government prepares new guidelines, so "Reservoir Dogs," "Dirty Weekend," "Bad Lieutenant" and "Mikey" have joined a list headed by "Straw Dogs," "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Exorcist," which have never been legally available on video in Britain.
From now on, says its director, James Ferman, the board will probably "cut more and classify higher." Gratuitous rape scenes won't be tolerated at all. Some films rated 15 will become 18's; others will be banned.
THE RENTAL INDUSTRY has come up with proposals, too. Soon every video is likely to carry a dagger symbol and information about how violent it is. But the Government, knowing that this might simply lure the young, may also require that children carry identity cards giving proof of age. Harsher penalties for unscrupulous video-store owners are a certainty; anyone who sells or rents banned videos will probably face a two-year prison sentence.
What of films on television?
When they are beamed down by satellite, they seem seldom to be cut. But on land-based channels, the only ones most Britons watch, the opposite is the case. The director Michael Winner, who thinks that British censorship goes too far, recently complained that ITV made 12 cuts in a battle scene in "Hannibal Brooks," the U-rated movie he made in 1968. In the television version of his "Death Wish," he added, "you think the characters die of food poisoning."
Such changes do, however, depend on the time the film is shown. It's assumed that young children are tucked in at 9 P.M., and the tougher stuff cannot be shown before 10.
The BBC is wholly self-censoring, but the independent channels are answerable to the Independent Television Commission. In practice, though, knuckle rapping is left to an organization the Government set up in 1988 to monitor the airwaves. Each month the Broadcasting Standards Council names programs that viewers have found offensive.
Recently it rebuked the independent Channel 4 for showing the gangster film "The Krays" without editing a mouth-slitting episode, and the BBC for transmitting "Captain America," in which a boy sees his family massacred, too early in the evening. The BBC was recently forced to take out newspaper advertisements admitting that it had been officially criticized for an episode of its popular series "Casualty" that showed rioting teen-agers and an arson attack on a hospital.
That decision attracted much publicity, but was it fair? Nobody has suggested that the producers wanted viewers to identify with the hoodlums as they tried to incinerate some of the BBC's best-loved characters. Some felt that the episode was a salutary reminder of the growing wildness of Britain's inner cities.
Indeed the particular argument that ensued embodied a more general one. How authentically can and should violence be depicted on the screen? At what point does its portrayal become irresponsible? And how true is it that simulated violence impels some people to become violent themselves? In recent months, all of these questions have loomed large in Britain.
Britons are not quite such television addicts as Americans, but they still watch an average of 24 hours a week, compared with 28.5 in the United States. Statistics about the amount of violence they watch are unreliable, since some surveys fail to distinguish between slasher movies, Tom and Jerry cartoons, and reports from the Balkans. The council recently estimated that a typical television viewer was exposed to four violent acts an hour -- less than in America but, in some opinions, enough to damage the damageable.
Here the debate gets polarized. Some deny that simulated violence has any ill effects at all, on the grounds that people know they are watching fiction. At a public forum in London recently, Mr. Winner accused the American film critic Michael Medved, who was attacking Hollywood for "exporting its toxic waste to the rest of the world," of belonging to the Dan Quayle school of analysis: "You remember, he blamed the Los Angeles riots on Murphy Brown." Others have accused pro-censorship politicians of offloading their responsibility for the prime causes of crime: unemployment and poverty.
There are informed voices who take a different view. Elizabeth Newson, professor of developmental psychiatry at Nottingham University, recently accused her own profession of underestimating both the "sustained sadism" in films and the potential effect of this on unformed minds; 25 senior psychiatrists and child-care experts endorsed this view.
Dr. Sue Bailey, a specialist in adolescent forensic psychiatry, told a conference convened by the Royal College of Psychiatrists that 25 percent of teen-age murderers and violent sexual offenders had repeatedly watched violent or pornographic videos before committing their crimes. As evidence that the films incite viewers to crimes, she cited the example of a martial-arts-movie addict who murdered with a samurai sword.
If there is a consensus in Britain, it is that an excessive diet of violent movies can corrode the sensibilities and lead to a hunger for more simulated violence, especially among the young and those on the margins of society. The producer David Puttnam confessed to being "more worried than I can say" about children being able to snitch videos of violent Hollywood movies rented by their parents and scroll through the uglier bits again and again. It was after talking to a 12-year-old Welsh child with a morbid fascination with "The Silence of the Lambs" that Anthony Hopkins decided against portraying Hannibal Lecter in a sequel.
DOES THIS JUSTIFY MORE official censorship? There is certainly evidence that the British public, once relatively unconcerned with the issue, has shifted sharply since the Bulger murder. An I.T.C. poll showed that 59 percent believed there was a link between violence on and off the screen, and 85 percent believed the television companies were not careful enough about what they showed.
The objections are obvious enough. How is "unnecessary violence" to be defined, and should artistic freedom be imperiled because of what may be a passing panic? Should this be a prime concern when 70 percent of British households are peopled by adults only? And shouldn't films and television sometimes forcefully remind the public that violence is a social problem, not lull them into a state of false security about it? That is the view of Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, who has warned that if all troubling images were removed, we would be left with optimistic weather forecasts and "gardening programs purged of footage of vicious caterpillars savaging harmless plants."
Yet listen to the late Anthony Burgess, author of "A Clockwork Orange," which to this day cannot be seen in Stanley Kubrick's film version on screen or video in Britain. He faced head on one of the oldest arguments, that restrictions on the portrayal of violence would have banned or bowdlerized many an Elizabethan or Jacobean play, and he ended up taking a surprisingly illiberal view.
Perhaps "A Clockwork Orange" and Shakespeare's "Titus Andronicus," which goes "about as far as one would expect from the most depraved porno-violence of today," were both too morally dangerous to be shown on television, he said. "In principle I am now for censorship in the medium," Burgess wrote. "I have to accept that I belong to the ranks of the menacing."
The debate is not finished, and its practical results remain unclear. But could the conclusions so far drawn from the Bulger case have been too shallow? The two guilty 10-year-olds were clearly as familiar with video shops as their forebears were with candy stores. Nor has the dominant boy displayed any remorse, perhaps because, in his attorney's words, he "has convinced himself he played no part in the killing" and "talks about it as if it was something he had seen."
That surely is suggestive. In a world where minds are shaped by television and video, maybe the boundaries between truth and fiction become blurred, and some people end up regarding all reality as virtual. A bleeding toddler and a horror-movie doll both become celluloid images. It is a problem that improving technology will make more acute, and it is very far from solved.

All in the Barracuda Family, a New Sitcom

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby 

 BODY:
"THE FAMILY OF MANN," Theresa Rebeck's new comedy at the Second Stage Theater, satirizes the morals and manners of the people who manufacture television situation comedies, in this case the producer, director and writers of a new series called "The Family of Mann." From what we see of it, the show looks like a piece of cheese, though we're told that the critics around the country are raving about it as if it were a new "All in the Family." That's one of Ms. Rebeck's more wicked jokes, but it's subsidiary to the main business at hand: a consideration of the mythomania, greed, self-interest and all-round ruthlessness behind the stuff that most of the time portrays America as some kind of spongy, laugh-filled Planet X.
Ms. Rebeck is not only alarmed, she also speaks with the authority of the observant outsider who has been on the inside. Like Belinda, her alter ego in the play, Ms. Rebeck has a Ph.D. in Victorian literature and has worked as a television writer in Los Angeles. She's also unusual among today's comedy writers (in the theater as well as television) in that she can come up with very funny lines that erupt naturally from the situations. Her characters aren't written to be played over the heads of the other actors to the house. They're blessedly unaware of any audience, being far too obsessed with their own wondrously high-paying jobs and paltry goals. 
 "The Family of Mann" isn't exactly a revelation. Like John Patrick Shanley's more economically hilarious "Four Dogs and a Bone," it's an update on the kind of Hollywood satire that's been around as long as Hollywood itself. Only now, Ms. Rebeck understands, the stakes are higher, considering the ease with which television infiltrates American households and the number of hours we all spend glued to our sets, whether we are interested in what we see or not. The boobs in power today have a control undreamed of in the past. Even in their heyday, movies were never as addictive nor as immediately influential. Contemporary television meets the demand for instant gratification in all-encompassing, astonishing ways that would have prompted the kings of old Hollywood to drool in envy.
THIS AWARENESS SEEMS TO have prompted Ms. Rebeck to load "The Family of Mann" with a certain amount of fuzzy theorizing about the relationship between reality and the imagination, and some metaphysical nonsense about angels, which isn't great even in "Angels in America." There's also a smugness that attaches to a tale about someone who, apparently like the playwright, turns her back on mammon to remain true to herself. That sort of thing is noble, but not as challenging as George Bernard Shaw's insidious habit of making his arch-villains equally noble as well as wise and practical. In ordinary circumstances, the Shaw comparison would not be fair but, since Ms. Rebeck also wants to deal in a small give-and-take of ideas, the thought arises.
As long as the playwright sticks to out-and-out satire, "The Family of Mann" amuses as it scores points. Her principal villain is Ed (David Garrison), the executive producer of "The Family of Mann," a successful, foul-mouthed prig with the manners of a sanctimonious gangster. Ed sincerely believes the cant he spouts at the top of the play: "It's a crazy idea, but we like to kid ourselves that stories about people living relatively decent, normal lives, the kind of lives I think most of us had in our childhood, might be of interest to America." Ed can be modest and friendly and shoot to kill, more or less simultaneously. According to one of his associates, Ed is not in this business for the money or power. He already has all he needs: "He doesn't have to do anything unless he thinks it's going to benefit mankind."
He's a good character, and Mr. Garrison plays him with a lot of vicious piety. As directed by Pamela Berlin, the play is beautifully cast and performed by Julie White, who plays the sweetly intelligent, morally steadfast if nonconforming new writer on Ed's team; Robert Duncan McNeill, as the jock who landed a job as a writer mostly because he was once a basketball star; Lisa Gay Hamilton as a gofer (the only black in Ed's employ) who eventually sprouts wings; Richard Cox as the smarmy, sexist director of the series, and Anne Lange and Reed Birney as two lethally desperate writers who may not have much talent left but who know how to handle Ed.
The play's least-successful conceit is to cut away from the infighting and the private lives of the members of the sitcom team to show us episodes from "The Family of Mann," with Ed and four other characters doubling as the actors in the show within. These segments (the first one is scored with a laugh track) evoke thoughts of a series that would never get beyond the pilot show, if it were even to get that far. They're neither funny nor instructive for being so dopey. Several of the most effective scenes in the play have more to do with the brief affair of Belinda and the jock than with satire. It's one of those liaisons that's no less satisfying for having been nurtured entirely by proximity and the emotional needs of the moment.
Derek McLane, who designed "Suburbia" at Lincoln Center and "First Lady Suite" at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, is responsible for the minimal set that magically serves as various offices, a barroom, a park bench and the kitchen for Ed's succes d'estime of a sitcom.
 
'101 Humiliating Stories'
 As part of the celebration of the recent Gay Games IV and Cultural Festival, New York Theater Workshop presented a limited engagement of "101 Humiliating Stories," the one-woman show written and performed by Lisa Kron and directed by John Robert Hoffman. Ms. Kron, who describes herself as "a big lesbian," is a pretty, infectiously cheerful young woman and a very engaging performer. Yet her material at the downtown house was extremely mild, even by the standards set by the stand-up comics who are the spine of television comedy these days.
She told one extremely funny story about being bamboozled into spending her office's petty cash for a whole new look at a Macy's makeup counter. There also were humiliating stories about meeting Sigourney Weaver, trying to trip Derek Jacobi in a London theater to attract his attention, the speech she gave to her Lansing, Mich., high school reunion (told in several variations) and the terrors of junior high school.
Ms. Kron is exuberantly "out" and clearly happy. These stories, though, were so small that they might be best appreciated in a living room. At one point, she pretended to be falling asleep onstage in mid-performance. Her yawns were contagious. If she hadn't immediately awakened, the entire audience might still be sleeping there.
 
THE FAMILY OF MANN Theresa Rebeck's comedy about Hollywood television writers works best when the author sticks to her satire.
 
101 HUMILIATING STORIES An engaging solo performer, Lisa Kron may be more interesting than her extremely mild stand-up material.

Vacation Checklist: Socks, Passport, Architecture

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
MY OLDER BROTHER collected lead soldiers; I collected ocean liner deck plans. It didn't occur to me that his interest in military miniatures and my fascination with tourist paraphernalia might be linked. What could war games possibly have in common with the Veranda Grill on the great Queen Mary?
The Queen Mary herself, for one thing: in World War II, the fabled liner carried troops. I once saw a photograph of the ship painted battleship gray and remember feeling shocked -- as if someone had taken an Art Deco cocktail shaker and turned it into a grenade. Only later did it dawn on me that when the Queen went gray, she was showing one of her true colors. Travel is not just a glamorous pastime. It is also a form of invasion. 
 "Back to the Front," a new book edited and designed by the New York architects Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, sets out to explore the connections between war and tourism as "related forms of conquest." Densely theoretical, the book is not your usual summer reading. In fact, it throws a disconcertingly cold, clinical light on the pleasures of summer travel. But for armchair travelers looking for intellectual adventure, "Back to the Front" may be just the ticket. It's got luggage, postcards, beaches (or at least pictures of them) and a delightfully paranoid perspective that could turn even a stay-at-home's cell into a room with a view.
Two mixed-media projects by Diller and Scofidio, fleshed out with a selection of scholarly essays and a short novel by Lynne Tillman, form the core of the book (published by Princeton Architectural Press in association with F.R.A.C. Basse-Normandie). Strictly speaking, neither project is a work of architecture. But they both address a subject that engages architects in increasing numbers. Tourism is contingent on places -- landmarks, historic sites, natural attractions -- and on the architecture of hospitality that serves them: hotels, airport terminals, convention centers. Architecture, as an art of place making, plays a major role in the tourist economy. It is a force in the global "monoculture" -- the homogenized consumerism that has accelerated since the end of the cold war.
One of the two projects, "SuitCase Studies," shown at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 1991, is an installation made of 50 identical gray Samsonite suitcases, each corresponding to one of the 50 states. Suspended from the ceiling and illuminated by halogen lamps, the cases are jackknifed open to reveal miniature tableaux within. These depict one of two kinds of common tourist attraction: battlefields (Bunker Hill, Fort Sumter, Pearl Harbor) or the homes of historical figures (Edison, Reagan, Liberace). Ranged in a flying phalanx at eye level, the cases possess the menacing allure of military hardware: this is the Stealth package tour, the Pax American Expressima, maneuvering in domestic air space before heading overseas.
The similarity of the suitcases and their contents points to the paradox of modern travel: while appealing to the desire to escape the familiar, tourism simultaneously contrives to insulate people from the discomforts of difference. Enticed by the promise of the exotic, we cocooned within environments equipped with all the comforts of home. "SuitCase Studies" unpacks a view of a world remade in the image of that paradox: a vast motel where regional differences live on as theme-park versions of themselves.
Diller and Scofidio's second project, designed especially for the book, resembles a SuitCase Study enlarged to the epic dimensions of the Bayeux Tapestry. Created to coincide with the 50th anniversary of D-Day, this untitled project is presented in a section of fold-out pages that document the geography, history and present-day uses of five Normandy beaches.
As the architects observe, the Normandy shore was a popular resort long before
D-Day. In fact, the Allies relied on postcards and tourist snapshots to help plan the landing. Today the coastline is not solely a historical site, not solely a resort, but a hybrid landscape, an amalgamation of trailer camps, tennis courts, and hotels interwoven with bunkers, graves and museums. Using a variety of graphic techniques -- photomontage, icons, maps -- Diller and Scofidio have drawn up plans for a place where the invasion never stops.
If it weren't for the Walt Disney Company, "Back to the Front" might seem little more than a set of highbrow variations on that pop cliche, the summer army of camera-toting, Bermuda-shorts-clad vulgarians that mass tourism has deployed over the globe in the half century since World War II. But Disney's proposal to build an American history theme park in suburban Virginia has made the discontents of tourism a topic of national debate.
The commercialization of history, the plague of urban sprawl: these are the main issues that have defined the debate. But Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, recognized that something more was at stake when he wrote in a letter to this newspaper that the planned park has precipitated a "referendum on Disney." What's going on is not just a backlash against a mouse. It's the mounting sense of alarm about the danger Disney represents: the risk that a homogenized, mass-mediated consumerism is becoming the smiley face of a new world order.
The menace in this order is not a foreign aggressor, and the threat is not confined to vulnerable cultures abroad. We're accustomed to viewing the world as a chiaroscuro of "modern" and "undeveloped" societies. But now we find with some dismay that the latter term applies to us. From a monocultural perspective, a tract of land in suburban Virginia can appear as undeveloped as a third-world nation. Those who oppose the Disney park are essentially asking, where are the restraints on the territorial expansion of our own way of life?
Diller and Scofidio's approach to the tourist culture is hyperbolic but not cynical. They do not attribute malign imperial intentions to the travel industry, much less to all us innocents peaceably enjoying aperitifs abroad. They imply no moral equivalency between war and peace. Rather, they point out that this paramount expression of peace -- the ability of people to travel freely across borders -- is overdue for the kind of scrutiny to which war has long been routinely subject. Wars remake cultures. So do campers.
IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO THINK that Diller and Scofidio can halt the phenomenon they analyze. The virtue of their work lies in the analysis itself and in their ability to express it in striking visual terms. While not conventionally architectural, Diller and Scofidio's projects nonetheless perform one of architecture's main functions. They want to make visual, spatial sense out of what's going on in the culture. They are reckoning with forces that are as powerful today as the industrial technology that gave rise to modern architecture at the beginning of the century. As the planned Disney park shows, those forces tend to uproot places as well as create them.
I myself prefer architecture that sits firmly atop foundations. Walls, plumbing, that sort of thing. But Diller and Scofidio's desire for detachment is understandable. Some of the most talented designers in the world have been building the architecture of tourism -- Disney alone has commissioned buildings from such stars as Arata Isozaki, Michael Graves, Aldo Rossi and Frank Gehry -- and the effect, overall, has been to line the beast's belly with delectable architectural snacks.
Yet in a sense, "Back to the Front" is a theme park itself, a portable Small, Small World ride that you can pack in a bag or tuck into a paperback. And to call this work architecture is perhaps not so fantastic. Think of those new Las Vegas hotels: thanks to the news media, these phantasmagorical casinos loom large on the cultural maps of people who wouldn't dream of setting foot inside them. Some now regard Las Vegas as a wave of the future, the ultimate architectural incarnation of a society that can't get off the roulette wheel. I'll put my money on Diller and Scofidio. This gifted team takes architecture back to the front of ideas.

Happy Anniversary, Hudson River Museum

 BODY:
The Hudson River, which starts as a stream at Lake Tear of the Clouds in the Adirondack Mountains and empties into the New York Bay 315 miles away, is being celebrated in a 75th-anniversary exhibition at the Hudson River Museum of Westchester in Yonkers, to Jan. 22.
"The River That Flows Both Ways: Hudson Stories," which opened last month, examines the river from historical, cultural, economic and environmental perspectives. Among the exhibition's highlights are paintings by artists of the 19th-century Hudson River School, like Frederick Church, Asher B. Durand and Francis Silva. 
 Also on display at the museum are three Currier & Ives prints, and 31 photographs that capture the river in various seasons, times and locations, in such images as the Britannia, a turn-of-the-century tugboat trapped in the ice; panoramic views of the cliffs of Yonkers, and a 1900 scene of loggers near Glens Falls.
Other items include an interactive topographical model of the Hudson's tributary system, a 1937 iceboat used to race on the frozen river, ship models, a model of a tugboat's deck (big enough for children to climb on) and examples of the manufactured goods that drove the Hudson Valley's turn-of-the-century economy.
The museum is at 511 Warburton Avenue in Yonkers, and is open Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Friday 10 A.M. to 9 P.M., and Sunday noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $3; 75 cents on Saturdays through the end of September, and free on Friday evenings in July and August. Information: (914) 963-4550.

HEADLINE: A Renewal Plan in the Bronx Advances

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
MELROSE COMMONS, the ground-breaking attempt by a South Bronx community to design its own urban renewal plan, has made it through the New York City bureaucracy.
The plan for about 1,500 housing units in a largely desolate 33-square-block area east of Yankee Stadium has in less than a year -- close to record time -- got the go-ahead from Community Boards 1 and 3, the Bronx Borough President's office, the New York City Planning Commission and the various other city agencies whose oversight is required in the city's complex land-use review process. Last month, it received final approval from the City Council. 
 Now comes the hard part.
"Does this mean there's a project?" said Richard A. Kahan, chairman of the steering committee for the Bronx Center, a major development plan for a 300-block area of the South Bronx that encompasses Melrose Commons. "No. It means there's a legal right to do a project."
For that legal right to become a reality, real-estate developers will have to be found who are willing to take a chance on that area of the South Bronx, and Federal, state and city money will have to find its way to the project. Yolanda Garcia, president of Nos Quedamos (We Stay), the neighborhood group that created the final plan, estimated the cost of Melrose Commons at about $15 million a block. At 33 blocks, that comes to almost $500 million, a lot of money at a time when government financing of urban renewal is not expected to approach the levels of the past.
"It will take a lot of work," Ms. Garcia acknowledged. But she said that she was willing to wait however long it takes.
"This community has been neglected for the last 40 years," she said. "We're ready to start moving on, and we want to do this right. We want to turn things around and make this a place where anybody and everybody will love to live."
The plan itself envisions a low- to mid-rise mixed-income residential community, with commercial and community facilities, parks and public spaces: 1,470 to 1,715 new dwelling units, 80 rehabilitated units, 175,000 square feet of commercial retail and office space, 200,000 square feet of space in community structures and 4.1 acres of mapped park and public open space.
One of the keys to the plan is population density. Under the plan, parts of the neighborhood are to include six- to eight-story mixed-use buildings with commercial bases, in the hope that such buildings will provide enough people on the streets and in the stores to help make the neighborhood safe.
"It's a housing type meant to insure an active, vibrant safe community," Mr. Kahan said, "and therefore will represent a good, sound economic investment."
Some in city government have questioned whether such buildings are feasible, whether there are any developers around willing to construct them. But those voices seem to be in the minority. The plan has the outspoken support of many people in the public sphere, from Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, one of its founders and guiding spirits, all the way up to cabinet level in the Federal Government, all of whom praise it as a prime example of a new kind of interaction and partnership between government and its citizens.
"THE revised plans to restore the community of Melrose Commons represent a guiding principle at HUD," said Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, who viewed the neighborhood and the plan on a visit to the South Bronx earlier this year.
"Successful revitalization absolutely requires the participation of the community's residents. The City of New York listened to the people who live in Melrose Commons because they understood that the fabric of a community is strengthened by these partnerships. I salute this success."
Mr. Kahan, the head of the Urban Assembly, a nonprofit planning group, and a former president of the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the Battery Park City Authority, said that the plan "has captured a lot of people's imagination -- which makes the likelihood of realizing this project much higher than if it hadn't."
"The work that has been done is already being viewed as a model of what can be done," he said. "The major asset we have going in is a cohesive community. We have had delegations from the Ivory Coast, South Africa, Chile and other places meet with Nos Quedamos to see how the group was conducting the planning process."
It didn't start out that way.
The Melrose Commons Urban Renewal Area is a 33-block area bounded by East 163d Street on the north, Third, St. Ann's and Brook Avenues on the east, East 156th through East 159th Streets on the south and Melrose, Courtlandt and Park Avenues on the west.
Planning efforts for Melrose Commons began in 1985, when the City Planning Department began studying the East 161st Street corridor as part of a plan to redevelop Bronx's downtown.
Melrose Commons, which included the largest contiguous stretch of municipally owned land in the city, was designated the residential anchor of the revitalization plan, prepared in late 1989.
At one point, the renewal plan included a middle-income community of 4,000 units: 30 blocks of small, attached houses. Then it became 2,600 units as a vital part of the Bronx Center plan, which Mr. Ferrer began in 1992.
But there was little public participation, and the Melrose plan involved relocating the residents of the neighborhood, which contains many vacant lots and buildings.
The planners had estimated that at the most, 78 private homes, 400 tenants in apartment buildings and 80 businesses employing 500 workers would have to be displaced.
All of which was news to the neighborhood's residents, who have said they first heard about Melrose Commons in the summer of 1992 when one of them accidentally met a city worker taking notes outside her house. Word quickly spread, and a committee was formed to fight the plan.
MS. GARCIA, whose family has owned a carpet store on Third Avenue for decades, said the feeling was that those who stayed with the neighborhood through the hard times, who had kept it going through the decay and the crime and the difficulties, should be part of the progress.
The 1990 census disclosed that the population of the Melrose Commons Urban Renewal Area was 2,897 people in 940 occupied units. The median household income in 1989 was less than $12,000 a year, one of the lowest in city.
There were 67 commercial concerns with about 255 employees; 19 automotive business with about 109 employees and 11 manufacturing or warehousing concerns with about 201 employees.
In addition, there were 22 institutional buildings, such as a police station, day-care centers, churches and a school, with a total of more than 730 employees. Residences included 120 occupied one- and two-family homes and three- to six-story multiple dwellings.
Indeed, much of the housing in the Melrose area was abandoned or demolished. Previous attempts to rehabilitate the neighborhood had never gotten off the ground. City figures show that about 60 percent of the area consists of vacant land or vacant buildings, with the city owning about 55 percent of all the properties in the urban renewal area, including 85 percent of the vacant land.
The neighborhood group was intent on keeping what was worth keeping and, equally important, designing a community that would meet their needs and would last. One resident, Pedro Cintron, a Nos Quedamos founder, would interrupt public forums held by Mr. Kahan's Bronx Center and loudly declare that he and his neighbors wanted to stay in their community and their homes.
The Bronx Center provided two community organizers. A longtime resident donated office space at 811 Courtlandt Avenue for Nos Quedamos to hold weekly meetings and discuss aspects of the plan with representatives of the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Parks, Transportation and other city agencies. The group would try to make its views clear and get the city to understand that its members, and not the bureaucrats, knew what was best for their neighborhood.
"In one year, we had 168 meetings," Ms. Garcia said. "We lobbied everyone. Every Tuesday and Thursday we would send out 250 faxes telling officials of our views." They worked with two architects -- Petr Stand of Magnusson Architects of Manhattan and Lee Weintraub of Weintraub & diDomenico of Manhattan -- both of whom participated on a pro bono basis.
The original plan, which was withdrawn by the city, had envisioned the center of the community as being in the south, closer to "the Hub," the long-established commercial and retail district along East 149th Street.
"IT was not anything that jumped out at us as a terrible idea," Mr. Kahan said. "But at a community meeting the residents said the center was in the northeast quadrant, where there many of the people live and where there are two abandoned courthouses, one of them a landmark."
So, Mr. Stand said, the northeast is now considered the neighborhood center, "and the idea is to place a planning center in the landmark courthouse and to have Boricua College" -- a private institution founded to serve Hispanic students -- "occupy the other one."
The original plan also called for a two-acre park in the middle of the project, "and that also didn't at first look like a terrible idea," Mr. Kahan said. "But to the community residents it was immediately apparent that such a park was an indefensible place. It would be a den for crack addicts and other criminals."
Instead, he said, the approved plan envisions "a hierarchy of spaces for different ages, children and adults, for different purposes, from mews streets to small parks, with different types of defensive characteristics around them."
Mr. Stand also said that the plans include upgrading the Melrose Metro-North station. "There are now six trains a day," he said. "We are going to research how to add trains and make it a community asset. After all, it is 15 minutes from Manhattan and can serve as a vital link to both Westchester and Fairfield Counties."
All of which sounds promising. But now that the approval has been obtained, how will the buildings get built?
Ms. Garcia said that the plan was to begin in the southeastern quarter, where much of the land is city-owned so there is less to be acquired, and where the project can build on current residential and economic development south of 156th Street and closer to the Hub.
"The area also brings into the concept everything we have talked about," she said. "There would be the six- to eight-story buildings with commercial bases along Third Avenue. The midblocks would have four-story town house walkups. And there will also be smaller one- or two-family homes. And it's all in conjunction with what's already here, which is not going to be torn down. Which was our principal statement."
The plan's backers say there are many potential resources.
"There is money in this year's capital budget to do a number of things," Mr. Ferrer said, "including facade improvement for existing housing and the first two years of site preparation work. In addition, HUD is committed to work with us in a strong way on multifamily houses in small zones."
Mr. Ferrer and United States Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Democrat who represents the South Bronx, have also asked Mr. Cisneros and the Clinton Administration to include Melrose Commons as part of a proposed empowerment zone for economic redevelopment and community rebuilding that would provide $100 million in Federal aid to the city.
The city's application for the zone includes the area around Yankee Stadium and the industrial strips of Port Morris and Hunts Point.
The request to include Melrose Commons, as well as the Mott Haven section, was made "after it became evident that the application did not address the issue," said Bernd Zimmermann, Mr. Ferrer's director of planning and development. The city and the state are expected to supply $100 million each to supplement the Federal funds.
The area around Melrose Commons has also seen successful development in recent years, most notably at Melrose Court, a housing development recently completed just to the east by the New York City Housing Partnership -- a nonprofit organization that works with developers and community groups to build housing in poorer neighborhoods -- the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Bronx Shepherds Restoration Corporation and the Procida Construction Corporation of the Bronx.
"Melrose Court has been very successful," Ms. Garcia said. "We can draw off its strength."
The $29 million Melrose Court, between Brook and St. Ann's Avenues and East 156th and 159th Streets in the Melrose section, consists of 263 condominium homes in 73 three- and four-story town houses. The project is subsidized by government funds so that two-bedroom units were sold for about $51,000 and three-bedroom units for $72,000. Because of the subsidies, there are income limits for potential buyers.
AND government subsidies, said Kathryn Wylde, the Partnership's president, are the key. "Melrose Court required a larger subsidy than our standard Partnership two-family homes," Ms. Wylde said. "There is clearly a market demand for ownership units prices in the $70,000 range and affordable to households with incomes in the range of $25,000 to $30,000. The Melrose Commons development will have to reach into that market, which means it will have to have sufficient subsidies to do so. And for a project on its scale, that will undoubtedly mean Federal as well as city and state assistance."
The prospects for rental housing, she said, will depend on Federal subsidies larger than those for home ownership. "That's going to be the bigger challenge. The ability to use all the tools in financing rental housing, including low-income tax credits, will be very important."
The question remains, however, whether developers are willing to put up the six- to eight-story elevator buildings with a commercial base that the plan calls for.
BACK in April, before the Planning Commission approved the proposal, Joseph B. Rose, the commission chairman, questioned the "urban design controls" in the plan, saying there were too many construction restrictions and questioning whether the city, state or Federal governments, or private developers, would be willing to develop the site as planned. He said he hoped that the plan would not remain dormant for decades because no one could obtain financing for the buildings.
"Right now, there are no programs or mechanisms or market for the built form that the plan calls for," he said at the time, adding that "inflexibility can be just as harmful as a lack of resources."
Mr. Rose proposed an amendment permitting the city to modify the plan. But the community, Mr. Ferrer and the Council objected, and the Council dropped the amendment before approving the plan.
Despite his setback, Mr. Rose has not changed his stand. "I think there are serious concerns by many people familiar with the economics of construction and the dynamics of the housing market in the South Bronx that some of the things that may be mandated in the Melrose Commons plan may prove overly restrictive," he said in an interview. "A lot of the things mandated in the plan are going to involve considerable public resources, and those resources are in scarce supply right now."
"But," he added, "we all hope it won't prove an obstacle to realizing a successful vision of Melrose Commons. I think we should all focus on working together constructively. But it's important to balance aspirations with considerations of feasibility."
Mr. Ferrer, however, said he believed that the six- to eight-story buildings called for in the plan can and should be built.
"There's a segment of the development community that believes that all you can do in inner-city neighborhoods is single- and two-family homes, because the poor people can't deal with anything different," the Borough President said. "Not only is that bigoted. It happens to be wrong and pretty stupid."
And the others involved are fully optimistic. "Joe Rose is right for things as they stand now," Ms. Wylde said. "But what the Bronx is banking on is that by putting forth an ambitious and visionary plan it can mobilize the public support and the private market sources necessary to make it work."
EVEN though there is now no program to support the mixed-use residential and commercial model proposed for Melrose Commons, she said, "the city is proposing such a model for the empowerment zone, and we believe it makes sense as a federally assisted housing type."
In addition, she said, there are also discussions under way with the state, particularly the Urban Development Corporation, "to bring in the funds necessary for the commercial portion of the subsidies."
Ron Shiffman, a member of the Planning Commission, director of the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development and a strong backer of the Melrose Commons plan, said that among the positive signs for the area was the fact that Caldor's, a major department store, had opened an outlet in a former Alexander's in the Hub.
"There are problems that have to be solved," Mr. Kahan said. "There are some financing packages that have to be created. The main problem is financing buildings that we don't have programs for this morning, but which everyone realizes we should have programs for. This isn't rocket science. It is doable if the will is there."
And, it is clear, the will is certainly there. 'Melrose has to happen," Mr. Ferrer said. "We will see most of the housing constructed by the end of this decade. And we're already in 1994. So that's not bad."
Kent Barwick, head of the Municipal Art Society, an active supporter of the Bronx Center and Melrose Commons plans, said he was certain the plan would succeed, in part because he believed the housing prototypes in Melrose Commons would also be desirable in most of the urban neighborhoods in the United States.
"Do I think it will be built tomorrow?" Mr. Barwick said. "No. But do I think it will be built? Yes. And when it is built do I think it will last? Yes."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Suburban Mall Competition;
Stamford Town Center Pins Hopes on New Addition

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
SUBURBAN mall development is reviving in Westchester and Fairfield Counties now that the economy is recovering. But a question rising above the clang of construction is what affect these developments will have on long-term efforts to expand shopping opportunities in downtown Stamford, Conn.
One new mall in White Plains is already in construction. Another has been proposed across the street. In Stamford, financing is being sought for the extension of an existing mall. 
 The mall owners have already had two extensions from city government, and are operating against a deadline on a third.
The Stamford project involves a proposed 400,000-square-foot addition to the existing 874,000-square-foot Stamford Town Center. The center is one of the country's most successful malls. Will it be choked off from its customers to the south by the new projects in Westchester, as some planners and retailers suggest? It is already limited on the north and east by existing Connecticut malls that have expanded over the years.
The 1.5-million-square-foot Danbury Fair Mall, the largest in New England -- is anchored by Lord & Taylor, Filene's, Sears, Macy's and J.C. Penney and has 217 satellite shops. The million-square-foot Trumbull Shopping Park has 200 stores, with Lord & Taylor, A & Straus and Filene's as anchors.
The Stamford Town Center opened in 1982. At present its tenancies are in transition. J.C. Penney, one of three original anchors, will move out this month, and Filene's, the 33-store New England-New York chain founded in Boston in 1851, will move in. The May Company of St. Louis, owner of the Filene stores since 1988 when Filene's Basement became a separate entity, will completely renovate the 183,000 square-foot Penney's space for an opening around next Christmas.
Early next month, the Eighth Stamford New Urban Corporation, an arm of F.D. Rich Company of Stamford, must come up with financing for its proposed $222 million expansion of the center or face withdrawal of the authorization for the expansion by the Stamford Urban Redevelopment Commission. In the process, it could lose ownership of a 4 1/2-acre parcel on Tresser Boulevard where the addition would be built. By failing to grow, the center could fall behind in the accelerating competition among the region's malls.
Next March, The Westchester, an 830,000-square-foot, 150-shop mall under construction in White Plains by the O'Connor Group of Manhattan, is scheduled to open on the site of the former B. Altman and Neiman-Marcus complex, anchored by Nordstrom and Neiman-Marcus.
A year or two later The Westchester could find itself across the street from Westchester Place, a proposed 820,000-square-foot mall. The developer, Alex Conroy of Greenwich, expects to file applications for rezoning and site plan approval this summer. Using the existing Saks Fifth Avenue site on Maple Avenue and Bloomingdale Road, and the Nynex site behind it, the mall would have 175 shops and Saks and Bloomingdale's as its anchors.
"I HAVE bought the Nynex property," said Mr. Conroy, "and I have a partnership agreement with Saks. This is a trade area of 900,000 people with an average income of $100,000 a year. After all of us are up and running the market will still be understored."
Bloomingdale's would move to the new mall from its current location on Bloomingdale Road -- a blow to Stamford, which lost its 243,000-square-foot, 36-year-old Bloomiingdale's in 1990. The store was closed because of financial troubles at the parent company, Federated Department Stores, and the taint of a murder that occurred in the parking lot.
A third White Plains mall, the 880,000-square-foot Galleria, anchored by A & S and J.C. Penney, opened in 1980 and recently completed a major renovation.
"There will be an overlap of stores," said Al Messer, general manager of the Stamford Town Center, "and there is no question that there will be competition. Certainly we are concerned, but I don't think they will seriously impact our business."
The price that the May Company will pay for the Penney store has not been disclosed, but it is assessed at $9.7 million, a figure that will rise in three years to $10.8 million under a newly phased-in revaluation. The current market value is about $15.4 million, according to Peter Sebastian, Stamford's assessor for commercial property.
"When the Stamford Town Center opened no one knew what the market would eventually be," said Mr. Messer, "so we covered them all with Penney's, Macy's and Saks Fifth Avenue as anchors and 130 small shops to support them. Over the years the upper-echelon stores emerged as the dominant market, cutting support for Penney's and some of the lower-end shops."
"Sales never measured up to the company's expectations," said Nancy Dickson, spokeswoman at the Penney headquarters in Plano, Tex., "so an opportunity to sell was the most advantageous option." J.C. Penney will continue to operate its stores in the Danbury Fair Mall, the Galleria, and the Trumbull Shopping Park.
"We believe the mall expansion is the best use for the property in question," said Elizabeth Saunders, chairman of the Stamford Urban Redevelopment Commission, "and my hope is that Rich will be able to get his act together or find someone to stand in his stead."
At its June 9 meeting the commission denied Rich's Eighth Stamford New Urban Corporation any additional extensions of time beyond Aug. 9 to find financing.
Rich bought the land from the commission in 1983 for $811,000. If Eighth Stamford cannot go forward with the expansion the land will be subject to repossession by the commission.
"WE purchased it years ago in a condemnation proceeding," said Ms. Saunders, "and conveyed it to the Rich organization with the caveat that it be developed as an extension to the mall. That committment has not been met, therefore we are empowered to take it back at no cost, but the commission is not enthusiastic about reclaiming it and starting all over again."
But, said F.D. Rich 3d, senior vice president of Eighth Stamford, "we don't necessarily concur with the commission's interpretation of the contract." His lawyer, Lawrence Gochberg, added that "this is a very involved legal process which will take a long time to unravel."
Crucial to the financing is Eighth Stamford's application to the Connecticut Development Authority for a guaranteed $46 million loan under the Tax Increment Financing Statute, a piece of 1992 enabling legislation by which bonds may be floated and the debt service paid with sales-tax revenues. A decision on whether to approve the application is expected within the next week or two.
"So far tax increment financing has never been used," said Joseph Cohen, spokesman for the state's Department of Economic Development, "and it is difficult to justify its use based solely on new retail sales taxes to be generated within a large project like the Stamford Town Center."
He noted that the Taubman Company of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., co-owner of the Stamford Town Center, had not been able to secure tax increment financing for a proposed extension of the Chapel Square Mall in New Haven and subsequently bowed out of the venture.
"We and the Rich organization are going to give this our best effort," said Christopher J. Tennyson, vice president of corporate affairs for Taubman, referring to the brief period for raising funds, "to protect the center's position as a premier regional shopping center."
"I think there will be a winner and a loser," said Mr. Conroy, promoter of Westchester Place. "It will be Stamford or White Plains. We hope to solidify White Plains as the dominant fashion market."

HEADLINE: Rental Conversions to Condos Spurt in Philadelphia

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
AN upturn in conversions of rental buildings to condominiums is under way in Philadelphia.
New owner-sponsors are undertaking the conversions in multifamily properties that they acquired at favorable prices from lenders or regulatory institutions. In three properties alone, there are more than 300 apartments, and prices are much lower than they were a few years ago. 
 It is the first time in six years that so many rental apartments have been offered for sale in one year, although it is nowhere near the pace of the early 80's, when more than 700 apartments were converted in a single building.
In Philadelphia, rental tenants do not have a right to renew leases once an owner has declared a property a condominium. Under a state law passed last year, a tenant who does not plan to buy a unit is entitled to remain in the apartment as a renter for up to one year, or two years in the case of a senior citizen.
Conversion pace is therefore not an indication of sales pace, but rather an indication of the pace at which developer-owners are declaring their properties to be for sale as condominiums. The main sales campaign is directed at tenants, but if there is no sale, the owner-sponsor may offer the tenant a lease renewal.
The new conversions are looked upon as the last chapter in the workout of residential real estate that was overpriced and overvalued in a declining market. "I don't think they will continue, because I think the fire sales are over," said Allan Domb, president of Allan Domb Real Estate, the city's largest condominium seller. "These are the casualties from two or three years ago."
The three major buildings in conversion are Rittenhouse Place, a 14-story tower with 14 apartments near Rittenhouse Square in downtown Philadelphia; Pier 3, a 172-unit waterfront development that was built as a condominium but found few takers at the original offering prices; and Garden Court, a 116-unit garden apartment complex in West Philadelphia.
The new sponsors are now offering units for sale at prices well below the 80's. For example, at Garden Court a 2,200-square-foot two-bedroom has been offered for $87,000. At Rittenhouse, buyers have been offered 2,100 square feet of raw space for $119,000.
Some renter-occupants have been buying. An example is John Listerud and Pia Newman, a West Philadelphia couple who had been saving for a house and shopping for one for five years. They chose to buy their two-bedroom apartment in Garden Court and an adjoining unit as well.
"It was hard to find a place where we would not have been trading down for a lot more money," said Pia Newman, who lives in a 2,200-square-foot apartment. "We looked at suburban houses and they looked very small. A house of comparable size is available in this area at the same price, but they don't sell. They stay on the market for a long time."
The smaller apartment they bought has 1,800 square feet. With 4,000 square feet of space at their disposal, the Newmans feel they have the flexibility to rent the second unit, or even rent or sell both units should they decide to leave the 20's vintage complex. They paid $167,000 for the two apartments.
The converter is Elliott J. Sharaby, a Miami developer, who purchased the Garden Court with plans to make it a condominium. He bought the property from the Federal National Mortgage Association for $2.2 million and said he would spend about $2.5 million on renovations and marketing, adding that 60 percent of the units had been sold in three weeks. He estimated that Garden Court could net him and his partners a $2 million profit.
"I'M out of here in a year," said Mr. Sharaby, an energetic 33-year-old. "I'd rather make a modest profit and sell it out quickly than hold it longer and hope to make a greater profit." Mr. Sharaby said that with limited-partner investors as backers, he did conversions in Washington, Baltimore and Beverley Hills, Calif.
Garden Court is about a mile west of the University of Pennsylvania campus and a 15-minute drive from downtown. The neighborhood has a mix of duplex homes, detached single-family homes and rental apartments.
Most of the city's condominium units are in towers surrounding small parks in the Rittenhouse Square or Washington Square sections downtown. Others sit along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, near the entrance of Fairmount Park, the city's largest park. Prices range from below $50,000 to more than $500,000. For example a one-bedroom, 725-square-foot unit near 15th and Locust Streets recently was advertised for $64,900 and three bedroom, 3,250-square-foot unit on Rittenhouse Square asked $550,000.
"Nearly $25 million has been written off and the savings are yours," reads the advertisement for Pier 3, the Delaware River waterfront development. Two-bedroom units there are advertised for $119,000 and savings are estimated at 66 percent of asking prices before the property was foreclosed on.
A Miami developer, Joel Gamel, and partners bought the 172-unit Pier 3 for a reported $8 million from the PNC Bank after it took back the property. As a rental in 1992, one-bedrooms ranged from $700 to $,1000 a month and two bedrooms from $1,000 to $3,000. The 172-unit property is almost totally sold out, real estate agents said.
One factor in the condominium revival is the 1989 repeal of an 8 percent city tax imposed in 1983 that was based on the selling price in condominium conversions. The tax had led to the shelving of conversion plans while lawyers worked to overturn it. When the tax was repealed as unconstitutional, conversions remained on hold because of the recession.
Although many industrial and warehouse buildings have been renovated as apartments, a more unusual transformation is a 14-story office tower, built in the 30's. The building, at 19th and Spruce Streets, had been purchased in 1988 for $3 million with plans for office condominiums.
AFTER the owners spent $1 million on new thermal windows, elevators, and other improvements, the downtown office market began its decline and the Bell Savings Bank cq foreclosed, said Jerry Pantelides, a Philadelphia developer. The Resolution Trust Corporation sold the property after it took over Bell Savings and Mr. Pantelides acquired it earlier this year.
"You couldn't get people to rent office space, let alone buy it," said Mr. Pantelides, president of JPA Real Estate Development. "I'd been aware of the property for three years and always thought with no parking and a small floor plate that office condos were a dumb idea. But wouldn't it be nice for apartments."
Mr. Pantelides plans 14 units of 2,100-square-feet, each taking up a floor and priced at $119,000 for the raw space. Fitting-out costs are estimated at $30 a square foot for minimal loft space designs and $50 and up for full three-bedroom designs.
He would not disclose his purchase price, but said unit prices could have been 30 percent higher if all the fitting-out work had to be done before offering them for sale. The only promotion for the building is a poster on its front door. He said he had received letters of intent and offers even before his lawyers had drafted the necessary condominium offering documents.

A Hopeful Sign on Yonkers Riverfront Plan

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
SINCE 1934, the City of Yonkers has been floating a variety of development plans for its 17 acres of vacant land on the Hudson River waterfront. But nothing much has come of them.
So when the latest waterfront plan was unveiled last December it hardly created a ripple. People adopted a wait-and-see attitude, said Jim Surdoval, director of the Mayor's Downtown Waterfront Task Force. "Waterfront development plans have been more talk than action," he said. 
 But now there is something to see. It's a two-acre waterfront park, called Pier Park. It opened last month and it was the setting on Monday for a Fourth of July fireworks display that brought 25,000 people down to the river -- a triumph for a city that hasn't made much use of its waterfront for years.
"The reaction has been incredible," Mr. Surdoval said. "We plan to stage a lot more activities throughout the summer."
While the park may be welcome, it is not permanent. It was constructed on a parcel whose development rights are still owned by Yonkers Waterfront Associates, which at one time planned a condominium called Pierpointe-on-the-Hudson.
The city, which owns the land, is negotiating with the developer to reacquire those rights, Mr. Surdoval said, but not with the intention of keeping it as a park. Instead, in accordance with its new waterfront plan, the city would like to see a small development on the site -- three- or four-story buildings with a mix of shops and restaurants on the ground floors and housing above.
"We think the first step is to get people down to the waterfront," Mr. Surdoval said, adding that it was Mayor Terence M. Zaleski's idea to develop interim uses for development parcels.
"That way we can stage events, have programs and people can see the waterfront again. Once developers see the interest, it will snowball from there."
Creating the park involved removing old fencing and blacktop and leveling the land. It was then sodded and landscaped and now has 40 benches and an asphalt promenade along the river's edge.
The project cost $65,000 and was financed with a Federal Community Development Block Grant.
Eventually, the city envisions turning its downtown into a westchester version of Baltimore's Inner Harbor, said Lee J. Ellman, the Yonkers Director of Planning. "Baltimore didn't turn around its waterfront in a year," Mr. Ellman said. "It took a couple of decades."
In the beginning of the Yonkers plan, most of the attention will be focused on the southern section of the city known as Getty Square, which in recent years has been characterized by boarded-up storefronts and solid steel security gates.
A key component to enlivening that area is rehabilitating the two-story City Recreation Pier built in 1890, just south of Pier Park. Architects from the Hastings Design Group, of Hastings-on-Hudson, are working on the design with the intention of preserving the pier's historic integrity. Among the changes will be the installation of mandated upgrades, such as an elevator for handicapped access.
THE project is expected to cost $1.2 million. The design work is being financed by a $147,000 from a Federal Community Block Grant, and the balance will be financed by the city.
Another tangible sign of waterfront improvement is the construction of a public boat launch, the city's first. The $850,000 project is currrently under construction at the JFK Marina, a 16-acre city waterfront park north of the downtown.
It is being financed by a $600,000 waterway access grant from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, with the balance coming from the city.
"Even though it's called a marina, it never lived up to its name," said Mitchell Tutoni, Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Conservation.
"By building it," he added, "the city is fulfilling a long-term promise."
The Yonkers Waterfront Concept Plan was designed by Ehrenkrantz & Eckstut Architects, of Manhattan. The firm is now working on a master plan, which should be completed by September 1995.
The plan calls for the creation of a downtown waterfront district, which would be roughly bounded by the three streets that lead to the water -- Main and Dock Street and Wells Avenue.
Streets within the district will get new sidewalks, coordinated signs, lighting fixtures and landscaping. In addition, the city plans to remove all downtown billboards and graffiti and replace solid security gates with grated ones.
The city already has much of the money it needs for the street improvements, including $4 million for construction costs, half of which comes from Federal Community Development Block Grants and half from state highway-improvement funds.
For years, the city's downtown was held hostage by the drawn-out failure of Pierpointe-on-the Hudson, a proposed 1,850-unit condominium development, less than 10 percent of which ever was built. The completed component, the 136-unit converted power plant, is now occupied.
FIRST proposed in 1979, it was supposed to enliven the downtown. But it fell victim first to a construction morotorium imposed on the city during its fight against a housing desegragation order. Then it seemed permanently doomed when the real estate market collapsed in the late 80's.
Up until last year, there were attempts to revive the project. But Yonkers officials now say the city is no longer interested in such a mammoth development.
"We no longer want a situation where we're dependent on one developer," said Mr. Ellman. "We're also concerned about density and height, and want to spread development throughout the waterfront."
Concerned about parking space, the city plans to establish small parking areas discreetly throughout the site. There is also a possibilty that Pier Park could become a parking lot starting next June when New York Waterways is expected to begin commuter ferry service from Nyack to Manhattan, stopping in Yonkers.
Westchester County plans to give Yonkers $16 million in the fall for the construction of a park and esplanade along the river and a marina, according to Lynn Oliver, the county's planning commissioner.
"The city'splans for its waterfront fit right into our stated No. 1 commitment to cities and to open space," said Ms. Oliver. The money may come out of the county budget and would need the approval of the County Board of Legislators, she said. "We've been very encouraged with everthing that Yonkers has been doing so far," Ms. Oliver added. "They've really shown a commitment."

THE ECONOMY
 
This Many Statistics Can't Lie: Joblessness Is On the Wane
Unless the statistics lie, the job picture keeps on improving. Last week came word of a surprise surge in payrolls in June -- 379,000 jobs added -- as the unemployment rate held steady at 6 percent. On top of that, new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 21,000, to 332,000, the largest drop since April and the lowest level since March. Of course, as always, statistics can fib a little. After a winter laden with snow days, for example, schools had to stay open longer, keeping school workers on the payroll. But, mainly, more jobs are appearing. And, yes, more jobs equals inflation scare equals rising interest rates. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to its highest level since Nov. 9, 1992, the week of the Presidential election. But for President Clinton, the point was this: "We have still Americans who need jobs, we have still Americans who are working part time who wish to work full time."
 
News From the Fed: No News
One on important front, nothing happened last week -- and that nonevent was big news. Whenever Federal Reserve policy makers sit down to meet, the financial markets hold their collective breath, waiting to see if the central bank will tighten the screws a bit more by raising short-term rates. But after this meeting, the Fed said nothing, which observers took to mean the Fed had not acted. Of course, just because after recent meetings the Fed has gone public with its decisions doesn't mean it's still doing so. Many people still expect the Fed to act sometime this summer, and the latest job numbers could give them the final nudge.
 
Bretton Woods It's Not
When, exactly 50 years ago, world leaders met in Bretton Woods, N.H., they faced grand challenges: a world to rebuild, a global monetary system to reinvent. But as this weekend's summit meeting began in Naples, world leaders tiptoed around the currency question. The big industrial economies are doing just fine, but global bond and currency markets are already on edge -- so don't rock the boat. When President Clinton tried his own brand of tiptoeing, though -- saying he opposed propping up the dollar, not wanting to "choke off growth" worldwide -- currency traders, sure enough, took the cue and sent the dollar near its all-time low.
 
Tally of Smoking's Health Costs
There are numerous ways of measuring the health costs of smoking -- with the tobacco industry, of course, at one extreme, often saying there's no cost at all because smoking isn't dangerous. And last week a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came out with a novel statistic: for each pack of cigarettes smoked, the taxpayer pays an 89-cent medical bill. Here's how that works out, according to its survey: health care for smoking-related illnesses cost at least $50 billion in 1993 (that represents fully 7 percent of the nation's total health costs), and Federal and state Governments pay 43 percent of that. So of a total health cost of $2.06 a pack, the taxpayer pays 89 cents.
 
Trump Tower South?
Once again, Donald Trump is out to spiff up the neighborhood. Last week he said he'd become part owner of a certain Midtown office tower and immediately vowed to restore it to "its rightful position as a world-class real estate asset." That surely noble sentiment, though, was not greeted warmly by Peter Malkin, who's had partial control of the building and who was quick to voice his feeling that "it is a world-class real estate asset." Granted, it's no Trump Tower, but you still may have heard of it: it's called the Empire State Building. And Mr. Trump, it seems, now owns half of it -- without having spent a penny. He managed that by helping the buyers -- European and Asian investors -- arrange financing.
 
Now, Where Were Those Bonds?
In the beginning there was cash -- well, O.K., beads or shells or even salt. But then came all this high-tech stuff, with banks zinging money mysteriously through the ether. What keeps them from losing a million here, a million there, through a hole in some electronic pocket? The answer: sometimes they do. Seattle First National Bank just settled with the S.E.C. and the Comptroller's office, paying a $75,000 penalty, after it simply lost track of $3 million in bonds. After the bank switched to a computerized system of handling bonds, the S.E.C. said, inadequately trained workers from a temp agency were handling things, and the bonds fell through the cracks. And who found them? The F.B.I., which bought them after they'd been stolen in transit. "This was a glitch in the extreme," said one official.
 
COMPANIES
 
New York, on the Savings Map
When you think savings giants, you think California, a land with two mortgages in every garage. The biggest guns are there -- Ahmanson, Great Western, Golden West. In New York, mega-banking generally means catering to the affluent, who want to move money at the flick of a computer. But suddenly, rising in the East, is a savings giant. Last week Dime and Anchor, two pillars of traditional mortgage lending, said they'd merge, with the combined company vaulting to No. 4 among savings banks. The new name: Dime Bancorp (a survey showed that Dime, born in 1852, is better known). At its head: Richard Parsons, Dime's chairman and a rising industry star.
 
Bond Shopping at Macy's
Macy's owes bondholders $1.3 billion it can't pay, and that gives bondholders a big say in Macy's fate as it tries to climb out of bankruptcy. So far bondholders have stymied an attempt by Federated to merge with Macy's, but that could change soon. Fidelity, the mutual fund powerhouse, which backs the merger, decided that if it couldn't fight the bondholders, it would join them -- in a big way. Last week Fidelity bought $80 million worth of the bonds -- not enough to dictate Macy's fate, but enough to make itself heard.
 
Texaco Pulls Up Some Stakes
American oil companies have had it with America. Environmental concerns put many areas off limits, and many oil fields are past their glory days, so they're increasingly looking abroad. And of course, like all good corporate citizens these days, they're trying to be stingy with costs. Texaco fit right in with both trends last week when it said it would sell half its 600 producing domestic fields and cut 2,500 jobs. Soon, it says, its balance will tilt, putting more of its spending abroad. And Texaco says it plans to keep cutting overhead.
 
A Crowded Exit at Fox
As Fox moves steadily toward television's big leagues, it's endured some highly visible growing pains -- perhaps because Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox, has been taking a special interest in it lately. Two years ago Barry Diller left as head of Fox Inc., beginning his detour in home-shopping land at QVC en route to CBS. More departures followed, with the latest coming last week, when Lucie Salhany, network television's highest-ranking woman, resigned from Fox Broadcasting after a reshuffling wiped out her position as chairwoman. Her tenure was marked by ups and downs, with one memorable down being her bet on Chevy Chase as Fox's great late-night hope.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
French Business on Trial
These haven't been good times for French business, with accusations flying about corruption at the very top and fraud charges against various executives. Last week brought a vivid episode in this drama, as Pierre Suard, head of Alcatel, the telecommunications and engineering giant, was arrested for questioning about possible misuse of company funds -- investigators say he used $740,000 of shareholders' money on a security system for his apartment. Alcatel has just agreed to pay France Telecom $11 million to settle charges of overbilling and two Alcatel managers were convicted of fraud.
 
An Argentine Miracle (for Some)
Latin America is a volatile economic laboratory, its nations lunging from system to system. A world-minded capitalism has won many a recent tug-of-war, but the cost is often high. In Argentina, President Menem's Government has wrestled inflation down from a numbing 5,000 percent in 1989 to under 5 percent, becoming a model economy-in-training. But left behind, critics say, are the rural poor. And last week, with unemployment rising and rich and poor drifting further apart, tens of thousands of out-of-town Argentines descended on Buenos Aires to protest economic policies. Said one member of Congress: "The Government cannot ignore this."

HEADLINE: In Defense of Tinkering

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The comments by Al Ries in "Marketers, Stop Your Tinkering" (Viewpoints, June 19) on the state of marketing reminded me of Henry Ford's adage, "You can have any color you want, as long as it's black." Mr. Ford's insistence on the status quo and his resulting failure to respond to marketplace needs almost bankrupted his company. Mr. Ries's recommendation for a successful Volkswagen strategy 20 years ago likewise would have been to stay the course. Forget innovation, forget competition, forget technology changes, ignore changing customer needs. 
 Ted Levitt of the Harvard Business School reminded us that the fundamental purpose of a business is the getting and keeping of a customer. As such, the fundamental purpose of a business and of marketing are the same. Mr. Ries's list of "winners" includes L.L. Bean, Ben & Jerry's, Southwest Airlines and Wal-Mart. They have mastered relationship marketing -- establishing, developing and maintaining successful relationships with customers.
Mr. Ries then equates "marketing losers" with companies that have downsized for efficiency, competitiveness and stronger price-value relationships. However, the downsizings, revampings and tinkerings derided by Mr. Ries -- at companies like G.M., GTE and Boeing -- are the primary reasons that the United States is again emerging as an economic giant. Mr. Ries's losers have made aggressive investments in information technologies, new product development and revamped distribution and marketing strategies.
Mr. Ries's winners continue to expand while others downsize. Invariably, these companies are marketing machines that fill marketing niches (Starbucks), capitalize on changing life style trends and social priorities (Ben & Jerry's), adopt new technology to mass marketplace needs (Compaq) or deliver unique price-value relationships (Wal-Mart and Southwest Airlines).
The exciting businesses Mr. Ries cites have emerged because management has always been tinkering, developing innovative marketing strategies around a carefully defined set of core competencies, which engendered strong customer loyalties.
Companies get into trouble if their attention is diverted from creating customers. Winners consistently maintain a focus on the customer, delivering value to customers and product quality. Tinkering is necessary to maintain a winning strategy.
The American Marketing Association? Yes, giants like AT&T and G.M. and countless small and midsize concerns have big numbers of A.M.A. members. And historically, A.M.A. members have been in the vanguard of marketing strategy development.
Does the philosophy of marketing itself need re-engineering? Not as long as it remains at the forefront in meeting the needs of the marketplace. Yet, the very foundations of the marketing discipline will also require tinkering, likely by A.M.A. members, in remaining responsive to ever-shifting marketplace needs.

HEADLINE: Profile;
She Always Said Feminism and Economics Can Mix

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS virtually any feminist academic knows, one occupational hazard of doing scholarly research on women is the possibility of failing to be taken seriously. Heidi Hartmann understands this and mostly chooses to ignore it. But she recalls finding out that her research organization was excluded from a competition for grant money on a subject it was well qualified to pursue. "You go along, you're getting increased recognition and more respect," she said. "And suddenly, you realize you're just a girl."
Ms. Hartmann, a Yale-trained economist who heads the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington, admits that she shed some tears -- "for days, literally" -- over that episode. She has shed more tears lately, but not over insults from dismal scientists in Washington research circles. Last month the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in Chicago awarded her the fellowship known far and wide as the "genius grant," provoking an outpouring of good wishes that both surprised and somewhat overwhelmed her. 
 Ms. Hartmann's friends and colleagues read the $295,000 award much the way she does herself -- as a vindication of feminist academic research, of Ms. Hartmann's groundbreaking work on women's economic issues and of her decision, long ago, to forge her own career path. Her doctoral dissertation was one of the first to suggest that economic theory might look different if women's, rather than men's, experience were taken as the norm, and her work on labor markets and discrimination has provided the intellectual framework for efforts to correct salary inequities.
In 1988, with a colleague, Teresa Odendahl, she co-founded the institute, a think tank that now often provides the numbers that lobbyists for women's causes take to Congress. The institute's research reports -- on topics like health care, welfare reform, temporary and contingent work, child care, family and medical leave and women in the labor force -- have usually been ahead of the curve of national concerns.
For this work, Ms. Hartmann, 48, has by no means labored in obscurity, but even close colleagues have urged her not to squander her talent on topics some in the profession view as marginal. Yet she has stayed her own course, pursuing real-world work on women in a field that values abstraction and takes "economic man" as a central metaphor. Winning a MacArthur may be the best revenge.
"She has taken a high-brow Yale economic education and focused it down on some hard, earthy questions about women in the labor force and the marketplace," said Robert M. Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "She is extremely effective. She beats up the numbers, does the hard statistical work, the way the rest of us do. I was delighted."
Ms. Hartmann's own delight was quiet but evident during a recent interview. "It does feel great. It feels great because they cited my work in economics and my 'capacity for self-direction.' You can get to feeling very marginal," she said. She stacked papers as she talked in her office near Dupont Circle, which looks a bit like what would happen if the "Odd Couple's" Oscar Madison got loose at the Library of Congress. Books in industrial-strength bookcases. Books on chairs. Books on the floor, overflowing and buttressing piles of monographs, which themselves overflow. A pair of fuzzy dice hang on one wall; a cartoon strip is taped to the door.
There was a time, Ms. Hartmann insists, when she could put her hands instantly on what she wanted. A shrug suggests this is no longer true. The pile of cards and notes from well-wishers -- "even a real telegram" -- has already become one with the chaos. Because for several years she has made less than she might have as a member of the economics establishment, friends are urging her not to just put her award money into the institute, but one obvious possibility is a larger space in its offices near Dupont Circle -- or perhaps a dumpster conveniently located outside her window on 20th Street.
"Heidi is somebody who has done a pioneering job under circumstances of adversity," said Ann Markusen, a Rutgers University economist who has collaborated with Ms. Hartmann. "She has been very committed, at some personal cost."
Some economists might prefer the Nobel, but it is the MacArthur that most stimulates the imagination, inspiring yearning and jealousy. It comes out of the blue -- a phone call, then a letter -- with no strings attached, as if a divine hand had reached out from some celestial aerie to reward the good, the true and the quirky. "It's a very significant sort of applause from a good source," said Barbara Bergmann, an economist at American University in Washington and the author of "The Economic Emergence of Women." Ms. Hartmann said her own reaction was a dumbfounded silence so interminable that Catharine Stimpson, an acquaintance and director of the fellows program, who called to give her the news, finally said, "Well, Heidi, dear, would you like to know how much money you're going to get?"
THE grant, worth $235,000 to $375,000, depending on the recipient's age, with older ones getting more, is paid out over five years. Ms. Hartmann's "class" includes Adrienne Rich, the poet and essayist, Arthur Mitchell, founder of the Dance Theater of Harlem, and Ornette Coleman, the jazz musician. The foundation requires no progress reports, no attempts at self-justification. Fellows do not even have to continue the work for which they presumably earned the award. "Quite simply, your award is for you to use for whatever purposes you choose," Hartmann's notification letter reads. The only intrusion of reality is the caution that recipients may want to consult a financial adviser, as the grant is taxable.
Ms. Hartmann is not one of the MacArthurs who, as Gore Vidal once wrote in another context, are well known to the few who know them. Since the late 80's, she and the institute's small staff -- 12, plus interns, students and consultants -- have carved out a solid and visible feminist foothold within Washington's clamorous policy community.
She appears frequently at conferences and in front of Congressional committees, and while Ms. Hartmann has been critical of the Clinton Administration, she clearly recognizes a kindred wonkish spirit in the Oval Office. After the 1992 election, she attended both the now-legendary A-list weekend in Vermont known as the Women's Economic Summit, a strategy and solidarity session organized to prepare for the new Administration's less legendary but A-list Little Rock Economic Summit.
When she went to graduate school, she had no intention of either hobnobbing with le tout Washington in 20 years or even of working on the issues that are the institute's reason for being. . "If someone had asked me in 1967 if the Family and Medical Leave Act was a goal, I would have said, 'Are you from Mars or what?' " she said.
Ms. Hartmann began at Yale in the fall of 1969, when the women's movement was coalescing and on campuses the Vietnam war was being called part of a systematic oppression of the third world. Ms. Hartmann arrived on campus, a young, married graduate student from Swarthmore College and, before that, high school in Toms River, N.J.
At Yale, the traditional economic theory of markets and enlightened self-interest failed to explain the events that came blasting through the television screen every night -- or to provide the tools to make the world a better place. Like thousands of other American students, Ms. Hartmann for a time embraced a leftish critique of capitalism, reading E. P. Thompson's "The Making of the English Working Class" and joining the upstart Union for Radical Political Economics.
She was not one of the visionary inhalers who thought a revolution was imminent. "I knew you could use economics to advance the cause," she said, "but I was never one of those really radical people who lived for a cause. I thought maybe I would teach at a community college."
She did begin to think, because she was active in groups like New Haven Women's Liberation, an early and influential feminist group, that there should be a place where scholars could talk about women's issues.
Ms. Hartmann pauses for a genuine belly laugh at the suggestion that her career has actually followed a plan. "In retrospect, it looks like a straight career path. The students around here" -- she gestures toward the catacombs outside her office -- "act like I always knew what I wanted to do."
One thing she knew she wanted to do was put women at the center of what she might call, in the current academic fashion, "discourse." "Heidi actually looked at what women did," said Ms. Markusen, the Rutgers economist. "All economic theory had the household as a unit of analysis, as if the household operated in lockstep. Heidi demonstrated that men and women had different stakes in both wage work and household work -- potentionally antagonistic stakes that would affect relations between them."
After Yale, Hartmann took a two-year position to help develop a gender and economics program at the New School for Social Research in New York, an institution known for being sympathetic to radical scholarship.
Ms. Hartmann's contract was not renewed, though, and a possible position at a comparable school failed to materialize. Ms. Markusen says that economics, which was becoming increasingly abstract and mathematical, simply wasn't prepared for real human behavior. "Two of her research papers at that time were absolutely seminal. It's clear in retrospect that economics was not ready to absorb sociological ideas," she said.
Ms. Hartmann moved to Washington in 1976, by then separated and with a 4-year-old in tow, to take a job with the Federal Civil Rights Commission. She soon moved to the National Academy of Sciences, where she stayed for 8 years, running projects in areas like gender bias in comparable jobs and women in nontraditional jobs. She also acquired the administrative and fund-raising skills she would need to survive in nonprofit Washington. A last foray onto campus in 1988, running the women's studies program at Rutgers, lasted only six months, in part because the institute -- which had been in the back of her mind since her graduate student days -- was actually becoming a reality.
Perhaps because she has always done almost exactly what she wanted, being underpaid has not been a big concern, though she used to compute how far behind inflation her salary was falling. She recently got a raise, to $75,000, that reduced her losses.
MACARTHUR fellows tend to use their grants to ease financial pressure, occasionally doing impulsive things like building a patio. At the interview, Ms. Hartmann had not decided what to do with the money, and had not even figured out how it would change her life, so she searched her bag and desk for a calculator.
"Oh, here's a paycheck I haven't deposited," she said. "Where is my calculator? I always have it. Always. Always," she said, starting to do the math by hand. The award means an extra $57,000 the first year, and climbs $1,000 each year from there, enough to allow her to feel secure that she and her husband, John V. Wells, an economist at the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation, can send their two younger children to college. Ms. Hartmann's daughter from her post-Swarthmore marriage just graduated from Macalester College in Saint Paul.
She will almost certainly take some time off to think and write about topics she doesn't have time for now. She may provide seed money for an assistant. She has already, since the interview, had an organizer in to beat her office into submission. "Being financially secure just makes life easier," she kept saying. It also turns the mind to indulgences that frugality generally keeps at bay. The word "massage" entered the conversation. Hartmann said almost defiantly, "I would like life to be easier, and if a massage once a week helps, well, maybe I'll do that."

Car Stereo Blasters, Beware This Device

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
WHAT: The Precision Sound-Level Meter Type 2232, made by Bruel & Kjaer Instruments of Denmark. Generic name: the sound meter. Greenish and rectangular (about 10 inches by 3 inches) with minuscule buttons and lettering, it resembles a prop from an old "Star Trek" episode.
 
BEAM THEM QUIET, SCOTTY: The sound meter is used by police officers and environmental control inspectors to crack down on motorists, nightclub owners and others whose noisy cars, stereos or air-conditioners are violating the law. (Yes, air-conditioners, if their noise output exceeds 45 decibels.) 

NEW YORK CITY, LOUD? Few would disagree that the city is too loud. The city's Department of Environmental Protection registered around 6,000 noise complaints last year, a third of them in Manhattan, and issued 917 summonses. Fines paid to the Environmental Control Board ranged from $220 for an air-conditioner to $8,000 for a nightclub. Theodore J. Mellard, a noise expert and corporate consultant who also uses the sound meter to monitor factory noise levels, ranks New York and Chicago as the noisiest cities in the nation and, with Hong Kong and Tokyo, the noisiest in the world.
 
TESTOSTERONE AND NOISE: The police, who increased their use of the sound meter after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani started a campaign against "quality of life" nuisances in the city, say that typical arrests in Greenwich Village are of young men who, vying for young women's glances, try to blast their car stereos to realms where no ear has gone before.
 
THE ECONOMY, STUPID: Last summer a crackdown in Greenwich Village hauled in 8 to 10 vehicles every Friday night; now that the sound meter's reputation has spread, the number has dropped almost to zero. With success like that, the police want to expand the program. But they own only one sound meter per borough and occasionally have to borrow from the Department of Environmental Protection. The Precision Sound Level Meter Type 2232 costs $1,300. Far less sensitive models sell for less than $50, but they would be shouted down, so to speak, in the noise of the city.
 
HOW IT'S USED: Let's say a certain car is terrorizing a neighborhood. First, an officer uses the sound meter to measure normal background noise in the area. The officer waits inside an unmarked car, pointing the sound meter at a spot 50 feet away. If the offending car sends the sound meter above 83 decibels as it passes that spot, the officer radios a patrol car around the block to stop the culprit, issue a summons and confiscate the car as evidence. Most drivers don't contest the charge, preferring instead to pay the traffic bureau fines of $100 and retrieve their wheels.
 
WOOFERS, TWEETERS AND JEEPS: The noise level in a relatively quiet room is about 40 decibels; that of a vacuum cleaner, 70; and aircraft noise, around 130. Lieut. Robert E. McKenna of the Sixth Precinct said the loudest vehicle he ever stopped, a Jeep Wagoneer, moved the digital reading to 94 decibels. "The whole back compartment was a huge speaker," he said. "I could feel the guy coming down the block." NORIMITSU ONISHI

It's a Case of U.S.-China Syndrome

BYLINE: By Edward A. Gargan 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
FROM an all time high on Jan. 4, the Hong Kong stock market has skidded downhill like an errant grocery cart, skittling across pavement, jolting over rocks and careering around blind corners.
Famously susceptible to the political and economic health of China looming just across the border -- a cough from Deng Xiaoping, China's senior eminence, can bring on pneumonia here -- the Hong Kong market is now troubled by last year's delirious property boom and this year's anxiety about the interest rate intentions of Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve. 
 Last week, the market continued its decline, with the Hang Seng index closing on Friday at 8,432.96, down 31 percent from its January high of 12,201.09. But apprehension about the Fed's two-day strategy meeting in Washington kept volume particularly narrow.
"In the first week of January the stock market peaked both in absolute terms and in terms of price/earnings ratios, at a P/E of about 21," said Kirk C. Sweeney, director of research for Lehman Brothers. A bullish assessment of Hong Kong's future delivered by Morgan Stanley last fall added to the skyrocketing property prices to turbocharge the market.
"But then at the beginning of the year," Mr. Sweeney said "you had concern about inflation and interest rates. There was concern that property prices would not be sustained. Deng Xiaoping is not getting any younger. So there was a correction. A market that increases 100 percent and retraces 30 percent is not unhealthy."
Clive Weedon, a director at Asia Equity Ltd., argues that the market began tripping over itself. "It got ahead of itself actually," he said. "Last year, a lot of foreign investors just came in and bought and bought and bought. And the whole thing got ahead of itself and naturally it came back."
Mr. Weedon added, "Last year, we had become reliant on overseas investment. We saw American money, Japanese money, European money. Now, American money is reasonably sensitive to interest rates. That flow of equity funds has been stymied somewhat now."
Still, most analysts here are not alarmed. According to Anthony Bellingan, the regional research director of Peregrine Brokerage Ltd., sees a regional pattern in the Hong Kong market's performance. "It's down a third, which is comparable to Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia," he said. "In the region, it's not a unique phenomenon. It reflects that a lot of our markets are driven by international liquidity."
Like many analysts, Mr. Bellingan points to the role of American interest rates play; the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the American dollar and interest rate shifts in the United States reverberate quickly here. "Interest rate moves get translated pretty quickly into our economies," he said. "And there's quite a correlation between the market here and the strength of the yen, an inverse correlation."
Still, for some analysts, the shadow of China, its shape and length, remains a persistent factor in investor confidence. "You can look at remarks by Zhu Rongji, saying that inflation is not so bad," explained Mr. Sweeney, referring to the senior Chinese official overseeing the mainland economy. .
"And Deng Xiaoping saying that he's concerned that growth is slowing down," he added. "This is the first time in weeks we've had upbeat comments from Beijing. And now, for the first time, there is some stability in the property market here. If the market moves sideways for a while, that's O.K. And if we get some strength in the dollar, that will attract European borrowers."
But Mr. Bellingan fears that a rush of foreign money into the market is unlikely. "I'm not expecting a large resurgence of international liquidity in this market, not like last year," he said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Bellingan remains bullish on the market for the rest of the year. "For 1994, we're looking at P/E's at about 11 times earnings. That's about 50 percent below the average for the region. It's 24 for Malaysia, 28 for Taiwan. It's right at the bottom of the region. On P/E valuations, this market is looking very, very cheap."
Because property companies are so central to the market, Mr. Weedon, believes that the big blue chip groups like Chung Kong Holdings and Sun Hung Kai are good bets at the moment. "My personal view is that the property sector will be the sector that will march back and lead the market," he said. "It's been the most oversold. It tends to be the go-go sector."
A continuing concern at the moment, however, has been the very thin volume of trading recently. Mr. Weedon said that many brokers are twiddling their thumbs for the moment. "Things are very tight," he said. "A lot of salesman around town are struggling to justify their bull market salaries."
Still, he said, the end of the bear market is probably in sight. "The market is very, very close to the bottom," he said. "We hit 8,200 a couple of months ago. We bounced back to 9,600 a couple of weeks ago. Now one suspects we're getting very, very close to the bottom again."
But to a great extent, explained Mr. Weedon, the immediate future will depend on what the Federal Reserve does and how American markets react. "We tend to take our lead from Wall Street," he said. "If Wall Street reacts positively, then we will react positively tomorrow. It's very embarrassing we don't have minds of our own."

HEADLINE: Conventions Are Ready, Primaries To Follow

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

 BODY:
SEVEN men and women have been campaigning to succeed Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. for months now, but except for occasional bursts of television advertising introducing their unfamiliar names to Connecticut, the candidates have focused on convention delegates rather than the public.
That ends in the next two weeks, as Democrats and Republicans meet in Hartford to choose their candidates for governor, and Mr. Weicker's A Connecticut Party convenes in Wallingford for a picnic at which Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark will be nominated by acclamation. 
 Both the Democratic and Republican conventions could result in voters getting an early say, in the September primaries, as to who they like. John G. Rowland, the former Congressman from Waterbury who nearly defeated Mr. Weicker in 1990, appears assured of the Republican convention's nomination a second time, but he may not be able to block Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer from winning enough delegates to qualify for a primary.
Among the Democrats, State Senator John Larson of East Hartford and State Comptroller William E. Curry Jr. both have enough delegates to file for a primary, and State Senator Richard J. Balducci of Newington is vowing to enter his name at the convention in an effort to qualify. Mr. Balducci has rejected overtures from the Curry and Larson campaigns, as well as party officials, to accept the lieutenant governor's nomination in the name of party unity. A fourth Democrat, Mayor Joseph P. Ganim of Bridgeport, pulled out of the race on Thursday and announced his support for Mr. Larson.
For Mr. Rowland and Mr. Larson, who have the greatest support from their party leaders and the largest war chests, the challenge in these last weeks before the conventions is to persuade delegates that they are best equipped to win an expensive general election in November, and that a primary can only weaken them.
Electability -- in large part defined by the ability to raise money -- is the only difference among the Democratic candidates, argued Senator Larson's campaign manager, Martha Carlson. "We are all Democrats, we are all pro-choice, we are all pro-family, we are all pro-worker," she said. "You could cover all of our positions with one derby hat."
But for candidates like Mrs. Kezer and Mr. Curry, their entire strategy is based on surviving the conventions so they can prove their appeal to voters in a primary.
"I think a primary is absolutely needed and absolutely helpful, because it offers voters a choice," Mrs. Kezer says, in asking Republican delegates to give her a chance to test her appeal against Mr. Rowland's. "Connecticut is basically a moderate state, and I'm a moderate Republican. John is a conservative Republican."
For many Democrats, the best argument against a primary is the experience of their last one, in 1990, when Representative Bruce Morrison defeated State Senator William Cibes, an open advocate of an income tax. His funds depleted, his campaign mired in the income-tax issue, Mr. Morrison staggered to a third-place finish that November, barely winning the 20 percent of the vote needed to preserve the Democrats' status as a major party. Mr. Cibes then left the party to join the victor, Mr. Weicker, as his budget chief.
"Once the primary ended, it was pretty much over for Bruce," said the state Democratic Party chairman, Edward Marcus. "It made it impossible for him to get his act back together and financially impossible for him to run the campaign."
Mr. Marcus's Republican counterpart, John Mastropietro, said, "I don't share the Democrats' hysteria about primaries," but he agreed that many primaries turn negative as candidates attack each other instead of debating the issues, just as in a general election.
 
The When of Conventions

 
 But while Mr. Marcus is hoping to use the Democratic convention (Friday and Saturday at the Hartford Civic Center) to settle on a consensus candidate, Mr. Mastropietro would just as soon eliminate conventions (the Republicans meet July 22 and 23 at the Bushnell) and decide nominations in direct primaries.
"Today people turn on their televisions, pick up their newspapers -- they know at least as much about the candidates as the delegates do," he said. "The need to rely on delegates to choose candidates for them is long gone."
The problem with Connecticut's system, he said, is that the primaries come so late -- this year's will be Sept. 13 -- that little time is left for candidates to soothe ruffled feathers and refocus on the general election, after spending months pursuing a relative handful of delegates.
"It seems to me an awfully, awfully long time and a lot of money to spend talking to 1,303 delegates instead of to the general public," Mr. Mastropietro said of the convention process. He would like to see direct primaries as early as May.
Among all candidates, Mr. Rowland, who is 36 years old, offers Republicans the best-known name, the result of his $3 million campaign in 1990. Like every other candidate, he has identified jobs and crime as the two most important issues, linking them to welfare reform and education as well.
His main proposal for improving the state's economy is to eliminate the personal income tax, making up for the loss of revenue by reducing state spending. A strong advocate of tougher sentencing laws for criminals, he criticizes the Weicker administration for spending lavishly on "Club Med" amenities in the state's new prisons.
Mrs. Kezer, a 51-year-old former teacher and state legislator, promotes herself as the only Republican to win statewide office since 1972. "I won my campaign four years ago," she says. "John didn't win his." She proposes to cut the income tax, but says it cannot be eliminated.
As Secretary of the State, she says, she has demonstrated that state government can be made to work more efficiently by cooperating with its employees. She would toughen criminal penalties by requiring felons to serve their full sentences.
 
Sizing Up the Democrats

 
 Among the Democrats, Mr. Larson, the 45-year-old Senate president, is most widely known, in part because of a recent television campaign. A former teacher and owner of an insurance agency, he stresses the state's need for a more focused economic development strategy and for improving its public schools. He is also concerned about family issues, and sponsored the first family-leave legislation in the country.
Mr. Curry, 42, speaks of his experience as comptroller and the need to reorganize the state bureaucracy. One way to make Connecticut a better place for business, he says, is to make its government work better. He favors community-policing strategies to curb violence in the state's cities, but also talks of making "prisons prisons again" by stripping inmates of privileges.
Mr. Balducci, who is 52, won praise as Speaker of the House in 1991 for holding together the coalition that enacted an income tax to end the state's immediate fiscal crisis. The owner of an auto salvage company, he says the state must improve its economy by aiding small businesses, controlling state spending and providing property-tax relief, as well as improving public schools.
 
The Weicker Candidate

 
 A Connecticut Party, meanwhile, has only one candidate, Mrs. Groark, who is closely identifying herself with the record of Mr. Weicker. At 56, her only political experience besides her term as lieutenant governor is four years as a Hartford councilwoman.
She pledges to continue the Weicker policies of making Connecticut more competitive by cutting business taxes and providing aid and loans to employers. Most of all, as an independent, she offers herself as an alternative to the politics-as-usual that voters rejected four years ago.

HEADLINE: Choir College May Get New Address

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG 

 BODY:
MOVING is nothing new at Westminster Choir College. Founded in Dayton, Ohio, in 1926, the institution moved to Ithaca, N.Y., in 1929. Three years later, the students and faculty packed up once again and relocated to Princeton, where the school still stands.
Now, Westminster, a renowned training ground for church musicians and music educators, may face the prospect of a third change of address -- this time to nearby Lawrenceville, home of the school's parent institution, Rider University. 
 No final decision has been made, but one thing is clear. Whether Westminster stays in Princeton or moves down the road, adjusting to changing times and economics will affect the school's environment, curriculum and mission.
The merger between Westminster and Rider (formerly Rider College) was one of necessity. The trustees of Westminster, which was heavily in debt, with deteriorating buildings and declining enrollment, began exploring the possibility of affiliating with a larger school in early 1991.
Though plagued by problems, Westminster was not without institutional suitors. Drew University, Yale University and the Juilliard School of the Performing Arts all expressed interest in acquiring the choir school.
In the end, Rider, a 129-year-old former business school, won out because of its proximity and solvency. On June 30, 1992, the merger became official, and Westminster Choir College affixed School of Music of Rider College to its name. When Rider gained its long-sought university status on April 13, 1994, Westminster became Westminster Choir College of Rider University.
But Westminster's new-found solvency and renovation failed to attract more young musicians to the college. The current enrollment of 343 students is almost the same as it was in 1991, the year before the merger.
Rising costs, combined with the static enrollment, have led to a deficit, which Dr. J. Barton Luedeke, Rider's president, estimated at $1.5 million a year. To compound the college's problems, buildings need further repairs and outmoded or undersized structures must be replaced.
 
Ran a Deficit
 Rider, which ran a deficit for the 1993-1994 school year, does not have deep enough pockets to meet these demands. Faced with an untenable financial situation, Rider's board, which includes two Westminster alumni, is investigating ways of preserving the choir college and returning it to fiscal health.
Among the cost-saving options under discussion is moving Westminster to the Rider campus, and that has created controversy. Rumors about a possible move began leaking out earlier this spring, and almost immediately what Dr. Luedeke calls "the anxiety meter" went up among students, faculty and alumni.
Concerned that the rumors were taking on a life of their own, Rider's president sent an explanatory letter to Westminster alumni in April. After outlining the school's problems, Dr. Luedeke encouraged alumni to continue contributing to the Westminster annual fund and referring prospective students. The letter ended with the line, "Together we can help Westminster move forward into a bright new future."
Though a move might improve the fiscal picture, Dr. Luedeke said that ultimately it would take a "combination of strategies" to keep Westminster in business. Increased enrollment is so crucial that he calls it the "driving force" behind Westminster's continued survival.
The primary responsibility for increasing enrollment will fall upon two newcomers to Princeton, Anne Meservey, director of admissions, and Westminster's dean, Robert Annis.
 
Turned a School Around
 Mr. Annis, who assumed his responsibilities on July 1, is no stranger to admissions problems. During his 11-year tenure as dean of enrollment services at the New England Conservatory of Music, Mr. Annis is credited with an admissions "turnaround" that included the recruiting of more Asian students to the Boston institution.
Mr. Annis, who visited Princeton during Westminster's alumni week, said the school's problems could not be solved easily. He said increased enrollment, strong fiscal management, new programs, more creative marketing and greater use of modern technology to spread Westminster's message would all play a role in the college's survival.
Westminster's affiliation with Rider is "crucial" to attracting new students, the new dean added. He said independent conservatories offering narrowly focused music programs were much less likely to survive than conservatories that offer students liberal arts courses as well.
While Mr. Annis, Ms. Meservey and others focus on increasing enrollment, trustees, administrators and consultants continue to explore the feasibility of consolidating the Westminster and Rider campuses. The Princeton campus, which was worth an estimated $20 million at the time of the merger, is being reappraised by an outside consultant.
At the same time, costs are being calculated for a building that might be erected to house the choir college on the Lawrenceville campus. Such a building would have to contain a concert hall of sufficient size to accommodate the Westminster population, plus soundproof practice rooms, office space, classrooms and a small recital hall.
The cost of construction together with the expense of moving large pipe organs and all the other choir college equipment will eventually be weighed against the cost of renovating and maintaining the buildings on the Princeton campus.
John Davis, president of the Westminster alumni association, said that he was "saddened by the possibility of the sale" of the Princeton campus, but that such a possibility was "the only feasible solution" to the school's problems.
He said that the school's chapel, which has not been able to accommodate the entire school population in years, needed enlarging or replacement, and that the costs of rehabilitating and maintaining the buildings on the Princeton campus would be high both now and in the future.
Though he is not optimistic, Mr. Davis has not given up all hope that the Princeton campus can be saved.
Dr. Luedeke remains undecided on the move. In mid-May, he said, he was in favor of consolidation. Now, he is not so sure.
Dr. Luedeke said of all the issues confronting Westminster, the financial ones are probably "the easiest to nail down." The emotional, educational and logistical problems will take longer to resolve. If the decision is made to move the campus, it cannot be accomplished for several years.

HEADLINE: DEATH OF A LEADER: THE OVERVIEW;
North Korea, Its Chief Dead, Leaves World Guessing

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sunday, July 10

 BODY:
The sudden death of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's Communist leader, in the midst of negotiations with the United States has cast a pall of uncertainty over one of the world's least-known and most dangerous countries. But experts said that initial signs suggest the transition has been orderly so far.
Shortly after noon here Saturday, the official North Korean news media reported that Mr. Kim, 82, had died at 2 A.M. on Friday after suffering a heart attack. [Obituary, page 13.] 
 The Government appeared, on the surface at least, to be well prepared for the event. Pyongyang Radio issued a detailed funeral schedule, flags were flown at half-staff and foreigners living in Pyongyang reported that thousands of mourners in the otherwise quiet capital were flocking to a huge statue of Mr. Kim in central Pyongyang and weeping before this symbol of the personality cult he created.
Mr. Kim, who formed the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948, was the only leader of his country in its brief history.
While there was speculation about a potentially violent struggle for succession, South Korean and American officials said they had detected no signs of such a conflict.
An edgy South Korean Government issued statements throughout the day Saturday that its military and police had been put on alert and that the Government was prepared for any developments. But the North Korean military was conspicuous for its lack of activity or unusual movements on both Saturday and today, several officials said.
Perhaps more important, Mr. Kim's anointed successor, his son, Kim Jong Il, was named head of the funeral committee and was referred to in official broadcasts as "outstanding leader," "his excellency," and a worthy successor to his father.
In a warm, rainy Seoul, the mood was calm today, with no noticeable police movements or concentrations of force. South Korean newspapers delivered mixed judgments on Mr. Kim's rule. Many condemned him for causing the nearly three million deaths during the Korean war and for subjugating North Korea's citizens under a despotic rule. But there was also concern that the hostile-edged stability he had come to represent might now be shattered.
While Sautrday's North Korean broadcasts created the appearance of a well-prepared plan being carried out smoothly, the developments raised as many questions as they answered and did little to ease fears about the threat posed to the region by North Korea, which has been locked in a tense dispute with the United States over its nuclear development program.
No explanation was given for the fact that it took the notoriously secretive Government 34 hours to announce Mr. Kim's death, and no foreign officials are being allowed into the country to attend the funeral or to confirm the accuracy of the reports.
It was unclear why the detailed medical report issued Saturday stated that Mr. Kim suffered the heart attack "owing to heavy mental strains." The source of the strains was not described and the mere mention of such a factor was a departure from the uncritical reverence generally shown Mr. Kim in the North Korean press.
In addition, the high-level negotiations that began in Geneva on Friday between American and North Korean officials have been suspended at the request of Pyongyang.
The talks, in which the United States is seeking to persuade North Korea to open its nuclear installations to international inspections, got off to a cordial start and offered some promise after the mounting tensions recently.
The negotiations came about after former President Jimmy Carter visited Pyongyang last month and sought to mediate the dispute. Mr. Carter delivered an upbeat assessment of his visit and said at the time that he had found Mr. Kim lively and engaged.
Just a few months ago, the United States threatened to impose economic sanctions if the North Koreans did not permit the inspections, and Pyongyang warned that sanctions could set off a war.
The suspension of the talks broke what might have proved the most useful link in years between the two countries, but President Clinton indicated at a news conference that they might resume later, another potentially hopeful sign.
"While they did ask that we suspend our talks with them, they asked that our representative stay in Geneva and we agreed to do that," President Clinton said in Naples.
Also, the first meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea, scheduled for July 25, has not yet been canceled, President Clinton said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Kim's death and the uncertainties it created hung heavily over the summit meeting of the leaders of the seven top industrial nations in Naples.
As a senior South Korean official put it Saturday, the best that could be said at this point was "there is no sense of crisis."
There are a number of reasons why other countries, especially South Korea, Japan and the United States, are likely to follow events in North Korea nervously.
Mr. Kim's death offers an opportunity for change and an easing of the hostility across the most heavily armed border in the world, the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea.
It also creates an opportunity for turmoil in the most rapidly growing region of the world, East Asia.
For years analysts and government officials have feared the possible consequences of Mr. Kim's death. The most obvious potential problem is an outbreak of violence within North Korea if a power struggle gets out of hand. The country has a standing army of well over one million, and possibly a few nuclear bombs, so such a conflict could easily spill across the border and threaten South Korea.
A civil war, or even a lesser conflict, could also cause the flight of thousands of refugees, a thought that worries South Korea and Japan.
A more practical concern is North Korea's poorly developed economy, which was heavily dependent on barter arrangements with the old Soviet Union and China. Only China continues to provide essential raw materials, like oil, on favorable terms.
North Korea conducts very little foreign trade, its industrial base is believed to be falling apart, agricultural production has been declining and the economy has been shrinking for years. In 1992, the South Korean central bank estimates, the North Korean economy shrank by 8 percent and had a per capita output of just $943. That compares with $6,790 in South Korea.
Thus the concern is that political turmoil could cause the already shaky economy in the North to collapse, setting off a major economic crisis in South Korea and other countries in the region.
West Germany had the strength to support a collapsing East Germany after the fall of the Berlin wall. But few experts believe South Korea could do the same for a stumbling North Korea; several recent studies have estimated that it would cost more than $1 trillion to rescue the North Korean economy.
A new regime, less experienced in economic affairs, thus worries many analysts.
Those fears were behind a quiet shift in policy toward reunification by the South Korean Government's several years ago. It began to moderate its calls for rapid reunification of the peninsula, the common stated goal of both countries.
Many in South Korea now believe the process should be stretched out, perhaps over 10 years or more, to give the North more time to catch up economically. Indeed, many in South Korea and elsewhere in Asia would like to see North Korea adopt an open economic policy similar to that of China, its last close ally, to accelerate the integration.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE OVERVIEW;
On the Stump, Not Much Talk Of Health Care

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN BERNARDINO, Calif., July 9

 BODY:
Health care may be at the top of President Clinton's agenda, but at least for now it has sunk near the bottom as an issue on the campaign trail.
With voters saying they consider crime and the economy more pressing, and with Congressional debate mired in complicated and contradictory health insurance bills, most incumbents surveyed around the country barely gave health care a nod as they campaigned back home this week during the Fourth of July recess. Virtually no Democrats made a point of publicly embracing Mr. Clinton's embattled proposal. And even some of the physicians running for office have abandoned health care as their driving issue. 
 Here in California, the state with the second-highest ratio of uninsured to total population, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat seeking re-election, spent her time not on health care but on events geared to the crime issue, which carries little of health care's political risks.
"Violence is the No. 1 issue in the state of California today," Ms. Feinstein said in an interview on Friday after examining confiscated weapons at the San Bernardino County sheriff's office. "Next to that, I would have to say people are worried about whether they have a job today, and at the end of the year."
The current absence of any public passion on health care is bad news for the White House, threatening to diminish Mr. Clinton's ability to pressure lawmakers to meet his line-in-the-sand demand for universal coverage and his proposal for some form of requirement that employers pay for it. Beyond that, many advocates of a health care overhaul believe, the silence could jeopardize efforts to reach consensus on any compromise.
Backers of the President's proposal predict that interest will be rekindled when the issue advances to the House and Senate floors later this summer and the nation begins to focus on specific legislation. Their best hope, they say, is that incumbents of both parties will realize that health care's political risk is double-edged: that although they may be attacked for backing a given proposal, they are also liable to be blamed for gridlock if no substantial measure is enacted.
Many experts say Mr. Clinton has no one but himself to blame for the current lull. After creating a sense of urgency by linking health care to the larger notion of security for all Americans, they say, he allowed opponents of his plan to frighten much of the nation into thinking that it would cost too much or compromise care.
"Clinton squandered the salience of health care reform by his cockamamie nine-month task force," said Ted Marmor, a professor of public policy at the Yale School of Management who was an informal health care adviser to Clinton aides during the Presidential transition. "Over the past year, the public has become more rather than less confused about the link between the problems and the remedies. The choices now are between some Chinese-menu compromise, where they take a little bit from a lot of other things, or literally deadlock."
 
An Unenthusiastic Senator
 The inevitability of compromise or nothing at all seemed apparent among the campaigning lawmakers around the country this week, particularly in remarks by Ms. Feinstein.
An early supporter of the President's plan, she said she had withdrawn as a sponsor because of his proposal to require employers to pay for most worker coverage. That provision -- the employer mandate -- would be too damaging to business, she said.
"The people of our state want me to get it right," she said, "not to vote for something that's going to have an adverse impact on jobs and employment and small business in this state."
Ms. Feinstein was also unenthusiastic about the four health care bills that have emerged from Congressional committees. "It's like looking at a kaleidoscope," she said. "The more you look at it, the more the parts change."
One exception to the health care soft-pedaling on the stump this week was provided by Representative Michael Huffington, Ms. Feinstein's Republican challenger. In his kickoff television advertisement for the general election, Mr. Huffington, although himself no supporter of the Clinton plan, delivered a stinging rebuke to the Senator for backing away from it. "It's the only principle of a career politician," the narrator says. "Save your own skin."
Even some Democrats who still support the Clinton plan say they are concerned that universal coverage, although viewed by most Americans as a laudable goal, is not a particularly compelling message, given that most people already have some coverage. "We need a rallying cry about better coverage and lower costs," said George Burger, a Democratic strategist in Washington. "I don't think universal coverage gets it done."
The party is toying with other pitches. In a memorandum to Democratic candidates, Representative Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, urged them to frame health coverage as a middle-class issue and to depict Republicans as protectors of big business.
"Health care will be the key to the '94 elections," he wrote. "It will play to our advantage only if we use every aspect of the debate to reinforce our key overall political/economic message: Democrats believe in linking work and reward; we're on the side of the hard-working middle class."
Nonetheless the candidates remain wary of embracing health care, since no one knows what will happen in Congress during the three months before adjournment or, more important, how the voters will react to whatever legislation evolves.
Another predicament for the White House is that perhaps the worst thing going for the President's proposal is its very name -- "the Clinton plan." Polls show that despite some nervousness over other elements, most Americans favor the proposal's cornerstones: universal insurance and employer mandates. But, the findings suggest, those same Americans have reservations about the author.
According to the latest Gallup poll, for instance, 77 percent support guaranteed coverage for all. And 52 percent say employers should pay either all or most of the insurance premiums. But in that same national poll, conducted June 25-28 with 1,019 adults, 49 percent said they opposed the "Clinton" proposal, compared with only 33 percent who opposed it a year ago. The poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
Those results suggest that Mr. Clinton must somehow press his own proposal while at the same time distancing himself from it. Attacks from Republicans and others -- including Ross Perot, who plans a large-scale television effort -- are likely to make that difficult.
"The key to political success with health care reform this year is to escape the label of 'the Clinton plan,' " said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist. "What members of Congress need to do is say they are supporting a reform that's going to achieve the President's goal of universal coverage but will be different in significant ways."
Charles Rund, a Republican pollster in Northern California, said the White House should be learning a different lesson from what he describes as a lack of public interest. The Administration should ask itself, "Did we make an issue out of something that's not there?" said Mr. Rund, adding, "I don't hear any statement of what I would call populist America coming forward to get excited about the issue."
Senator Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat who is a leading advocate of the President's proposal, said he was confident that the battle would turn in Mr. Clinton's favor.
"Nafta was a dormant issue until the last few weeks," the Senator said as he prepared to take the stage to lead a forum on health care in Sioux Falls this week. "Then, all of a sudden, the whole country came alive. I think you're going to see the country become very actively engaged in the coming weeks as this debate goes to the floor."
Other lawmakers are not so sure. Across town from Mr. Daschle's meeting, Senator Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican who was one of a bipartisan group on the Senate Finance Committee that produced a health care compromise, told a gathering of health professionals that Mr. Clinton would have to bend on universal coverage.
"We can't do universal coverage unless we pay for it," he said. "And if the Finance Committee can't pay for it, nobody can."

Chart: "DIARY: Health Care Developments"
 
WHAT HAPENED LAST WEEK
 
Members of Congress went back home over the Fourth of July recess, and President Clinton traveled to Europe for the G-7 summit. As a result, last week was a lull after the feverish conclusion of committee action. Seeking to drum up public support for Mr. Clinton's goal of universal coverage, members of the Cabinet traveled around the country for health care speeches. On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee made public a television advertisement poking fun at the insurance industry's "Harry and Louise" advertisements. In a nearly deserted Capitol, staff members worked on possible combinations of the four plans the committees left behind.
 
WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK
 
Congress returns on Monday and begins work on Tuesday. The Democratic leadership will begin weighing what combination of the committee bills stands the best chance of winning approval in the House and Senate. The White House plans to step up its outside-Washington campaign.

HEADLINE: 7 NATIONS TO GIVE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO CREATING JOBS

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NAPLES, July 9

 BODY:
Describing the toll of unemployed in their countries as an "unacceptable waste," leaders of the seven major industrial democracies agreed today to pursue policies to keep a nascent economic recovery on track, encourage growth and create jobs.
Then, joined by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, they turned to global political problems in a session overshadowed by the death of the President of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, and uncertainty about his country's plans to develop nuclear weapons. 
 The economic talks also produced a joint pledge by the leaders to "continue the momentum of trade liberalization." But President Clinton had to retreat from a proposal that finance, trade and commerce ministers of the seven nations immediately begin a review of trade barriers in the hope of presenting an agenda at the next annual meeting, in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Mr. Clinton, who is trying to shore up his international policy credentials on his European trip, had committed his prestige just 10 days ago to acceptance of that proposal.
But France, supported by Britain and Germany, objected that new trade proposals would only make it more difficult for each country to ratify the sweeping accord reached in December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Their goal of ratification by the end of this year will pose no particular difficulty in France, but it will require all the persuasive skill the Clinton Administration can muster in Congress.
Surprised and embarrassed, Administration officials said later that they had thought other countries would give more support to the proposal. France has not yet ratified the trade agreement; Germany did so on Friday.
Mr. Clinton said he felt good about the talks despite the setback, in part because the leaders had agreed to discuss next year what financial and political institutions were needed to meet the challenges of the next century. The Group of Seven consists of the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Canada.
On the immediate problem of the decline of the dollar against the yen and the German mark, the leaders said not a word, perhaps out of fear of driving it down further, as President Clinton did when he talked about the dollar here on Friday.
Nor did they say anything to indicate whether central banks would buy large amounts of dollars to try to halt or reverse the dollar's slide, something the Europeans say would be futile anyway until nervousness in the capital markets fades.
"We shared the objective of a strong dollar," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. But he said he refused to "telegraph" what the Federal Reserve Bank would do.
The seven men said they would encourage "stronger cooperation between our appropriate authorities to respond to the growing integration of the global capital markets" and insisted that nothing fundamental was wrong with their economies.
"Inflation is now at the lowest levels in over three decades and the conditions are in place for strong and lasting noninflationary growth," their communique proclaimed.
 
Finance Ministers Also Mum
 The seven finance ministers meeting here talked about the dollar at some length, officials said, but they did not issue a statement. The German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, said the ministers "agreed the economic fundamentals are solid," with low inflation and the prospect of significant growth this year in both the United States and Europe.
In their communique, the seven heads of government reaffirmed that "unemployment remains far too high, with over 124 million unemployed in our countries alone."
"This is an unacceptable waste," the statement said. "We will build on the present recovery by accelerating reforms so as to improve the capacity of our economies to create jobs."
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan was not among his colleagues today in the meetings at the 18th-century Royal Palace, across the blue bay from Mount Vesuvius. Summer heat was described as one reason he was taken to a hospital on Friday night, suffering from diarrhea and dehydration. His spokesmen said Mr. Murayama planned to join political discussions on Sunday, the final day of the summit talks.
 
Aid for Russia and Ukraine
 Before Mr. Yeltsin joined the group for dinner tonight, the leaders agreed to help Russia join the global trade agreement and to continue to provide financial underpinning for economic reform.
The seven nations offered Ukraine $200 million, in addition to $100 million previously offered by the European Union. They also offered an unspecified amount of loans to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, part of which exploded in 1986, and replace it with three safer reactors.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, which joined France in proposing the Chernobyl aid package, pronounced himself satisfied, calling the unsafe reactor "a ticking time bomb."
The seven leaders also offered Ukraine up to $4 billion of aid from international institutions over the next two years if it begins converting state-owned industries to private ownership, as Russia is doing.
 
All This and Soccer, Too
 For the most part, the leaders seemed to be in a self-congratulatory mood. Though their host, Prime Mininster Silvio Berlusconi, may have been upset by word today that his brother will stand trial on corruption charges, he seemed buoyant after Italy defeated Spain, 2-1, in today's World Cup match in Foxboro, Mass.
Though Neapolitans had been told not to stream into the streets to celebrate because of security measures, they disregarded the instruction with gusto, filling the streets on motor scooters and tooting air horns.
President Clinton was also upbeat. "I was struck by the degree to which the vision and the goals of the United States are shared by our partners," he said. One thing they agreed on, he said, was to discuss in Halifax "what we want the world to look like 20 years from now."
"We are still working with the institutions that we settled on at the end of World War II," Mr. Clinton said. "Are they adequate for the problems we face today and tomorrow? And if not, how do we need to change them?"
He made light of his disagreement with France on the trade review. "Every member of the G-7 except one affirmatively said they agreed with my trade proposal," he said. "One country said that this could complicate -- if we raise another trade issue now, that approval of GATT in his country was not a foregone conclusion."
President Francois Mitterrand, asked to explain France's position, said, "Instead of a too-rapid return to GATT issues, it would be prudent to wait for completion of the ratification process." But he said that France would be ready for further discussions next year, after ratification.

HEADLINE: Exxon Valdez Trial Focuses on Spill's Effects

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, July 9

 BODY:
The second phase of a Federal trial on the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 started this week with testimony about the life stages of herring and the intricacies of the wholesale fish markets as the oil company and the fishermen suing it battled over how the spill affected Alaskan waters.
For some jurors, who earlier found that the Exxon Corporation and the Valdez's skipper, Joseph J. Hazelwood, were reckless in causing the 11 million-gallon oil spill, the string of scientists and economists produced inadvertent catnaps. 
 "In a trial this long, where you have long stretches of technical and boring stuff, it would be strange if there weren't some of that," said James Neal, a lawyer from Nashville aiding Exxon's Federal case.
Other evidence concerned marine plants, life cycles of salmon, ocean temperatures and the price volatility of fishing permits. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday.
Jurors in Federal District Court here intend to begin deliberations on Tuesday on a request by roughly 10,000 fishermen for $978 million in compensatory damages. The same jurors are set to consider punitive damages later this summer, which could expose Exxon to damages of up to $15 billion.
The jurors will examine loss estimates from several salmon fisheries in Cook Inlet, Kodiak and Prince William Sound, as well as alleged damage to the sound's once lucrative herring fishery. Commercial herring seasons failed in 1993 and 1994.
Exxon experts testified that there was no relationship between low prices paid to fishermen today and any consumer worry about tainted fish five years ago. Exxon says low fish prices are caused by market factors like the availability of farmed fish. Since the second phase of the trial began on June 20, the company has argued that the Alaska coastline has recovered from the spill.
At the same time, Exxon is defending itself against a lawsuit in state court. The plaintiffs in the second case include six Alaska native corporations and six Alaska municipalities. Claims were consolidated into four cases seeking $86 million.
Much of the state case involves alleged land damages. Plaintiffs concentrated their case last week on coastal-dwelling Alaska natives, who have relied on the sea for food.
Exxon lawyers say the claims are "greatly exaggerated," noting that one Alaska native corporation acknowledged that many of its 1,900 shareholders do not live on Prince William Sound.
The state trial is scheduled to last another month. The Federal case began on May 2, and no end is in sight.

HEADLINE: DEATH OF A LEADER;
Kim Il Sung, Enigmatic 'Great Leader' of North Korea for 5 Decades, Dies at 82

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sunday, July 10

 BODY:
By the time Kim Il Sung died on Friday at the age of 82, there was not one "Great Leader" running North Korea. There were three.
There was the man seen around the world as a Stalinist maniac, who 44 years ago sent his troops pouring over the 38th parallel to unify the Korean Peninsula on his own terms, and who four decades later burst again onto the front pages as a man in search of a nuclear bomb to save his regime. This was the Kim who intimidated his neighbors into silence, who used his unpredictability as a weapon. 
 There was the Kim Il Sung of North Korean myth, whose likeness dominates Pyongyang and every town square in the form of 30,000 statues, the man who was lionized in song as the "sun of the country" for single-handedly defeating two enemies in one generation: Japan and the United States.
And, in recent years, there was the grandfatherly Kim Il Sung, the smiling leader seeking respect for his economically disabled nation, the man who three weeks ago embraced Jimmy Carter and used him as a conduit to President Clinton, who was not yet born when Mr. Kim was installed as North Korea's leader. It was that incarnation of Mr. Kim that led the former President to declare, with little hint of skepticism, that a "miracle" had occurred. One of the world's most fearsome dictators actually sounded reasonable and eager to end his confrontation with the West.
They were all images that Mr. Kim, the peasants' son who went on to become the longest-surviving Communist leader of the cold war, knew how to exploit brilliantly. When his death came early Friday morning, he had been staging a remarkable international comeback, a shadow from the old newsreels of the Korean War who thrust himself into the atomic glare of the 1990's.
 
An Enduring Puzzle To the Outside World
 For those who met him, he was the incongruous dictator of a hard and unforgiving land. Former Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, who met Mr. Kim twice, said a few days ago:
"He has this avuncular persona that stands in stark contrast to the reality of the regime, which is without question the most ruthless and tyrannical anywhere in the world. It is like meeting Hitler at Berchtesgaden and commenting on how he got along with the dogs and the children. He has the blood of millions on his hands; he has a society based on Orwell's '1984.'
"So you expect someone who will act like Saddam Hussein, a forbidding, threatening presence. And he is just the opposite, always smiling, always speaking softly."
In fact, to step into Kim Il Sung's North Korea was to enter a laboratory from Orwell's wildest imaginings: a country that could not afford to keep the lights on at night, and yet which built -- but may never open -- Asia's tallest hotel, a country where the people seemed almost robotic in their praise of their leader and his son, Kim Jong Il, his presumed successor.
Millions of North Koreans, until this morning's news, have never lived in a country not run by Kim Il Sung.
During his rule North Koreans were urged to devote at least two hours a day, and four on Saturdays, to "Kim study," memorizing his sayings. His birthday was, for decades, the nation's greatest holiday, celebrated with "mass games" in which North Korean youth performed remarkable gymnastic feats.
It is a country of operas like "My Happy Country with a Great Leader," whose lyrics include:
O, Generalissimo, Kim Il Sung,
Our fatherly leader!
The people are unfailingly loyal to you!
Our party is the best in the world!
Socialism is the best in the world!
Let's defend Socialism,
Under the unfurled red banner!
Mr. Kim seemed, in every public utterance, to be nothing short of a god. Everything North Koreans received from the government -- clothes, rice, apartments -- were said to come directly from "the Great Leader" or "the Dear Leader," his son.
 Pyongyang considered 50,000 new apartments to be the Great Leader's birthday gifts to his people. But when a reporter toured these "gifts," no one discussed the fact that there was little heat and electricity.
"You have to remember that at home, President Kim Il Sung is treated as a combination of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abe Lincoln," Mr. Carter said this week in Tokyo.
Mr. Kim's philosophy centered on the principle he called "juche," which he said meant "holding fast to the principle of solving for oneself all the problems of the revolution and construction of one's own efforts." This was to be accomplished, he added, while "applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism."
He held every important post in the country, including General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, its one party, and President of the country. And when he died, no one had yet really figured out his game: whether he was using the threat of an atomic weapon to get economic aid for his bankrupt country, or whether he was wielding it as a suicide pill to save his regime from absorption by the South.
"It is possible," one American official who has met Mr. Kim, said today, "that we will now never know."
 
From Humble Origins, A Steep Climb to Power
 Kim Il Sung was born to a peasant couple in a small, mud-walled house on the outskirts of Pyongyang on April 15, 1912, shortly after the Japanese began their formal occupation of Korea. For years that house has been visited daily by thousands of North Koreans.
Mr. Kim often used his simple birthplace to contrast his own early life with Pyongyang's American missionaries and Japanese residents. "In the 'Westerners village,' at the time inhabited by Americans and the Japanese settlers, brick houses, shops and churches increased in number," he recalled vividly many decades later, but across town "the slum quarters were getting bigger."
It is nearly impossible to separate truth and fiction in the state-sponsored mythology about Kim Il Sung's youth, but in all the stories there is a constant subtext: Mr. Kim's struggles against greater powers around him, particularly America and Japan.
Those two countries controlled the world in Mr. Kim's view, and it was the Kim family's destiny to battle them. In his memoirs, published two years ago, Mr. Kim maintained that his great-grandfather set fire to the General Sherman, a "U.S. imperialist aggressors' ship" because its crew went about "stealing the people's possessions and raping the women" while sailing up the Taedong River to Pyongyang in 1866. Mr. Kim's biographer at the University of Hawaii, Suh Dae Sook, calls these stories "politically motivated fabrications." but most of them seem impossible to verify or disprove.
Whether the stories are true or not, the myths have become the man.
Mr. Kim said he was a schoolchild when he committed his first act of rebellion against the Japanese occupiers, using a pocket knife to scratch off the title "Mother Tongue Reader" from the textbook issued by the Japanese colonial government, which required children to speak only Japanese. He said he wrote "Japanese Reader" on the cover, and from that moment, "whenever I saw children trying to learn Japanese, I told them Koreans must speak Korean."
Neither his memoirs nor official biographies dwell on the fact that he spent most of his youth in Manchuria, where he learned Chinese. That later turned out to be a crucial skill, as he joined China's communist guerrillas. And it was from China that Kim obtained the Communist philosophy that he combined with the nationalist mission his father bequeathed him -- along with two pistols -- on his deathbed in 1926: to free the peninsula from Japanese domination.
 
Images of Resistance, Masterfully Manipulated
 Mr. Kim served as an anti-Japanese guerrilla in Manchuria, Siberia and the North Korean border areas, but it is impossible to verify the claims of his astounding feats, including the killing of a unit of Japanese special police who were tracking him in 1940. The next year, he was forced to retreat to the Soviet Union for the remainder of the war. He makes no mention of that time, perhaps because it would be too obvious that his son, the "Dear Leader," was born there in February 1942, instead of on Korea's own soil. Mr. Kim was married to Kim Chong Suk, who died in 1949.
When he reappeared in Korea in late 1945, after the Soviet Union was already administering the area, it was in the uniform of a Soviet major. It was a ticket back home: At the war's end, the country was cut roughly in half at the 38th parallel, with the Soviet Union assuming the temporary occupation of the northern part and the United States the occupation of the southern zone. Reunification of the nation was the Allies' announced goal. Quickly, and with Stalin's apparent backing, he took control of the Korean Workers Party and called for a reunification under Communist control.
Of course, Mr. Kim's emergence was a far more complicated than the official accounts suggest. When he returned to Korea after 20 years' absence, his Communist party was tiny, outnumbered by other nationalist groups. But he rose to power by denouncing the "lackeys" of the Japanese and the Americans, and wiped out many of his enemies -- 60,000 people in his first purge.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was created in September 1948 after the United States organized the first government in the South, the Republic of Korea.
When Mr. Kim led an invading army into the South in June 1950 -- a scene of carnage that today seems a world away from modern Seoul -- the Truman Administration saw the takeover as the first step in a far broader Communist plot, directed from Moscow and Beijing, to seize much of Asia.
But a remarkable new study published earlier this year by Stanford University Press, one that is fairly chilling read in the context of the current nuclear standoff, shows that it was Kim Il Sung who did all the plotting. Documents recently made available in Russia, along with others that have slipped out of China, indicate that Mr. Kim was convinced he could take the South in three days.
His forces met little resistance in the first weeks, and by early September had driven the South Korean Army and its American allies to the Pusan area, at the southeastern tip of the Korean peninsula.
After a brilliant beginning, Mr. Kim's war plans went astray. He was surprised when, five days after his soldiers began streaming across the 38th parallel, President Harry S. Truman authorized American land, sea and air forces to go to South Korea's aid. Eventually 15 other nations responded to the United Nations call for help. Led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, they reacted with a counteroffensive on Sept. 15, staging a large-scale invasion at Inchon, a conquered South Korean port on the west coast about 20 miles from Seoul. MacArthur's forces pursued them back over the parallel and, on Oct. 19, captured Pyongyang. By late November Mr. Kim and his troops had been driven almost to the Yalu River on the Chinese border.
But he was a wily strategist, and with "volunteers" from the Chinese Army and Air Force and some from the Soviet Union he recaptured Seoul in January 1951 and held it briefly. For the rest of the war bitter fighting was centered nearby and roughly along the 38th parallel.
MacArthur, who wanted to carry out another invasion of North Korea, advance beyond the Yalu into China and mount a full-scale assault on Communism, was relieved of his command by Truman.
As talks on a truce dragged on, battles continued. Finally an armistice was signed on July 27, 1953, ending the war that Mr. Kim had thought would reunite Korea under his control. It was a dream he never gave up.
According to official South Korean statistics, roughly 225,800 South Korean troops were killed in the war, along with 294,150 North Koreans, 184,000 Chinese and 57,440 United Nations troops, of whom more than 54,000 were Americans. In addition, 250,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed in combat, and millions were left homeless on both sides of the border.
 
Rivals Eliminated, Power Consolidated
 Mr. Kim emerged in a position to wipe out his remaining rivals. In later years he was to send his political enemies to work in the uranium mines, where the life expectancy was about two years. Those mines turned out to be critical assets. Years later he never forgot the threats issued by MacArthur and Truman, that the Americans might end the war with a mushroom cloud. The fear that the North could be subject to nuclear attack from the United States, to many minds, was the real start of North Korea's nuclear program.
At the end of the war, it seemed as if the North was destined to be the truly successful Korea. It had abundant natural resources, and with Chinese and Soviet help, Mr. Kim began an ambitious program of rehabilitation and industrialization with Soviet-model collective farms and heavy industry. A propaganda campaign led citizens to believe their country was an oasis of wealth and stability in a world impoverished by cruel capitalism. They had no way to see or hear about anything else: To this day there is no television from outside the country and no foreign publications allowed. The few foreign visitors are kept on a tight leash.
Mr. Kim courted his allies, but kept a measure of independence. In a single week in 1961, he signed treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual military and economic assistance with both China and the Soviet Union. He continued to accept aid from both countries when the need arose. Through the years that need arose increasingly often.
The cost of the country's huge army took its toll on the economy. The DMZ, along the 38th parallel, became a eerie landscape of mines, tank traps and heavy artillery, and remains so to this day. Both sides built up enormous forces: Mr. Kim installed artillery that could shell Seoul from the North. But Mr. Kim also worried about his Communist allies. He was eager to maintain his slightly distant relationship with China and the Soviets, juggling them to keep from getting crushed.
In 1968, as the Vietnam War raged, North Korea and Mr. Kim surged into the headlines again. The North seized an American intelligence ship, the Pueblo, and its crew stayed in prison for 11 months. In 1972 there were the first gestures of peace to the South, called the Red Cross Talks, in which both sides talked of allowing families divided by the war to meet. But those negotiations broke off and were not resumed for 18 years.
The country began its slow spiral down in the 1970's. South Korea, with twice the population and a booming economy built on steel, cars, computer chips and other consumer goods, began to pull ahead: its economic growth was far faster, and the South's per capita income in 1990 was five times higher than the North's.
With the end of the cold war came the greatest blow of all: An end to the subsidies from Russia and, to some extent, from China that kept the North Korean economy going. Since 1989, by South Korean estimates, the North's gross domestic product has actually shrunk 2 or 3 percent a year.
For decades the Kims had been building a nuclear complex at Yongbyon, a mountainous area 60 miles north of the capital. Around 1980, construction began on a 25-megawatt reactor, that American intelligence agencies argued that the plant was designed for making plutonium, not for making electricity.
The cat-and-mouse game over the past few years has been all about the North's progress in building that technology, while denying it.
But every time there was talk of finally taking action regarding North Korea's nuclear development, the Asian allies fretted that Mr. Kim should not be provoked. The warning lights became impossible to ignore in March 1993, when the North announced it would pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty rather than face continued pressure for disclosure and inspections. Their withdrawal was later suspended, but inspectors were kept out.
When North Korea began removing more fuel from its reactor this spring, potentially creating material for five more nuclear weapons, the United States moved for United Nations sanctions.
As fears of a confrontation grew, the United States sent more equipment to its bases in Japan and South Korea, from Patriot missiles to ammunition to laser-guided bombs.
In the last weeks of his life, Mr. Kim had one brilliant maneuver left. He let Mr. Carter, who was deeply opposed to sanctions, take up a two-year-old invitation to come visit Pyongyang as a private citizen. After the first night of talks, Mr. Carter went on television to announce that the Great Leader was ready to deal: He would freeze the country's nuclear program while the United States talked about a range of diplomatic and economic benefits that might end the North's isolation from the world. Meanwhile, international inspectors, who had been barred from parts of the nuclear sites, could stay there. The Clinton Administration was suspicious, but eventually dove through the opening. Mr Carter also emerged with an invitation from the South: A summit meeting between the Presidents of North and South Korea, a first since the peninsula was divided in 1945. Five decades after Asia's the war ended in a precarious stalemate, it would have been a symbolic melting of the last Cold War division. For many Koreans it would have undoubtedly raised a surge of nationalism that Kim Il Sung would have applauded: differences aside, we are all Koreans, our country divided only because we were pawns of the Cold War. He died 17 days before the meeting was to begin.

HEADLINE: Jersey City Schools Audit Complicates State Control

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 7

 BODY:
When the State of New Jersey seized control of the Jersey City schools in 1989, officials cited fiscal corruption as a prime reason for the action. Now, five years later and just weeks before the state board is decide whether to extend the takeover, charges of financial mismanagement have again shaken the district.
Leo F. Klagholz, the Commissioner of Education, announced this week that an audit of the office of the Jersey City school business administrator had found a host of irregularities, inappropriate spending and weak controls. Two top officials have been dismissed over the findings that led to the audit. Elena Scambio, the Superintendent appointed by the state to run the district, has resigned. 
 But Dr. Klagholz says the turmoil does not mean that state takeover has failed in Jersey City, or that state control of local districts will not work.
"Takeover is a viable concept with great potential, partially when compared with what existed before," Dr. Klagholz said. "This is reflective not at all of the success of takeover. This is reflective of what can occur if we don't take our responsibility seriously in a state-operated district."
 
Leader Was on Leave
 The tumult over fiscal impropriety erupted in May, when Dr. Klagholz announced that his office had found irregularities in the awarding of a consulting contract to Child Study Team Associates of Bloomfield. He charged that two employees, Victor Demming and Elizabeth Guarino, altered documents, paid the firm $250,000 before it provided any services and processed payments without documentation.
Mr. Demming, the district's business administrator, served as acting superintendent during much of 1993, when Dr. Scambio was an assistant commissioner for urban schools in the state Education Department. Dr. Scambio returned to Jersey City last January. Ms. Guarino was executive assistant to the superintendent.
Dr. Klagholz said the audit found loose fiscal policies and weak internal controls. Among the irregularities were contracts that had not been signed by the right people; hand-written checks issued without proper requests or signed with a signature stamp; about $225,000 in incorrect or unnecessary payments made to various people and agencies; unauthorized travel advances; repairs of personal vehicles and salary increases of $15,000 to $22,000 awarded with no record of formal approval.
Dr. Klagholz said that the irregularities mostly occurred while Dr. Scambio was on leave. Because Dr. Scambio's Trenton position allowed her to continue overseeing Jersey City, she was essentially performing two jobs, and the Jersey City schools were being run by two people.
 
2 Employees Dismissed
 "I don't mean to criticize," he said. "But in retrospect I don't think it was a good idea."
After discovering the irregularities, Dr. Klagholz ordered the audit and called in the state Attorney General's office. He also called on Dr. Scambio to dismiss the two employees, but she refused. This week she resigned, saying she would not carry out his order. Dr. Klagholz appointed Peter Contini, an assistant commissioner, as acting superintendent, and he immediately dismissed the pair.
Dr. Scambio declined to be interviewed for this story.
The audit results come as the state is preparing to extend its takeover. State law on takeovers calls for keeping control for at least five years. State officials have hinted almost since the beginning that they would remain past 1994.
In the long, contentious process of getting into Jersey City, Dr. Klagholz said, state officials neglected to design a plan for getting out.
 
When to Go Home
 "In the future," he said, "we should go into the district with some sort of game plan, knowing how we'll decide when to turn back control.
"Here we are at the eleventh hour, absent a plan. I'm not sure what alternative we have but to extend it."
The question of when to declare victory and go home has broader implications. Paterson, the state's third-largest district, was seized in 1990. And the largest district, Newark, may be just months away from being seized.
On June 30, state officials received the findings of a 14-month investigation of the Newark school system, which has nearly 50,000 pupils. After reviewing the report, state officials are empowered to issue an order requiring Newark officials to prove why the district should not be seized. That order could come by the end of July.
Newark residents, many of them passionately opposed to state takeover, are watching the events in Jersey City.
 
Double Standard Is Seen
 "They're asking for two more years, but I wonder if they would give a district in trouble two more years to correct themselves," said Patricia Bradford, a Newark resident opposed to takeover in that city. "They still haven't answered the question, 'Can you teach children better?' "
When the state seized control of the Jersey City schools, more than 40 percent of the children entering high school failed to graduate. A state investigation found inept management, chronic disrepair, nepotism and an outmoded curriculum. The district's 30,000 students consistently scored near the bottom of standardized tests.
Several Jersey City residents said the change in leadership is a chance to test the takeover process and to begin restoring local control.
Robert Perry, a member of the school advisory board, said the board should have more authority than it has now. He suggested the state show good faith by giving board members a part in selecting the new superintendent.
"We are really the only official community voice," he said.
Raymond O'Brien, also a board member, said the district improved greatly under Dr. Scambio's leadership. Buildings were cleaned and repaired, principals given increased autonomy, curriculums rewritten and programs like full-day kindergarten extended throughout the system.
"I would hate to see anything halt that progress," he said.
 
Questions of Power
 But some see little improvement. In some schools, fewer than 25 percent of students pass the state high school proficiency test. Though absenteeism has improved, the dropout rate remains high -- the district continues to lose one of every six or seven high school students.
Dr. Klagholz said he would consider changes in the way the state controls a seized district. He has already told the state auditors that from now on, they will report to state officials and spend much of their time in Trenton.
"I have the feeling that Jersey City has been neither community-controlled nor state-controlled," he said. "The state hasn't paid a lot of attention."
The state must now create a plan for restoring local control. The 1990 corrective plan focused on specific problems, like the use of district vehicles. It includes no benchmarks for deciding when test scores have changed enough, or when enough financial safeguards are in place.
 
Need for Indicator
 Dr. Klagholz said one goal should be state certification. The district's inability to meet minimal state education standards was one reason for the takeover. But the district remains uncertified.
Dr. Klagholz says officials also need to find a student performance indicator they can agree upon, whether it be the state standardized tests, or national achievement tests.
"If you want to say there's been improvement, you can find the data," Dr. Klagholz said. "If you want to say there hasn't been improvement, you can find the data. If you want to say there's been regression, you can find the data. And people are doing all those things."
One of the biggest challenges is to insure, as far as possible, that patronage, mismanagement and abuse will not return when the state leaves. The irregularities found by the audit underscore how hard that task may be.
"It was politics and patronage which made this place an educational sewer in the first place," Mr. O'Brien said. "I could easily see it happening again tomorrow if the state leaves in October. With a $300 million budget, the wolves are circling."

HEADLINE: DEATH OF A LEADER: REACTION;
U.S. Unsure If Kim's Death Will Change Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NAPLES, July 9

 BODY:
President Clinton and his aides said today that they had no real way of knowing how the death of Kim Il Sung would affect what remains the Administration's gravest foreign policy problem.
It was evident from their comments that the North Korean leader could not have died at a worse time for an Administration that only recently allowed itself to hope that the aging leader could prove instrumental in reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ending a fierce dispute with the United States over nuclear weapons. 
 With Kim Il Sung having left his Government at the brink of parallel talks with the United States and South Korea, the question that could not be answered even by the high-ranking American officials who joined Mr. Clinton here for the summit of the leading industrial democracies was whether a successor might be prepared to order -- and have the clout to carry out -- the enormous policy changes the 82-year-old Communist dictator appeared to have been weighing in his final days.
At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Clinton expressed reluctance to comment about the situation beyond a few known facts for fear of adding to "the sense of wariness and misunderstanding" that has poisoned relations between the United States and North Korea in the past.
With the high-level talks between American and North Korean officials that began in Geneva on Friday now postponed, Mr. Clinton urged gently that they be resumed "as appropriate."

 
 
Summit Plans Unchanged

 
 As one hopeful sign, the President cited news reports saying that the North has told the South that it intends, despite Kim Il Sung's death, to proceed with the summit between the countries that is scheduled for the end of this month. He also reported that the leader of the North Korean delegation in Geneva for the talks had asked their American counterparts to remain there until he received further instructions.
Mr. Clinton, who consulted earlier in the day with Defense Secretary William J. Perry and other top advisers, went on to emphasize that he had seen no need to put American forces in South Korea on military alert. But the uncertainties in dealing with the world's most isolated Government had clearly been enormously complicated.
"Because of the remoteness of this country, because of the suddenness of this change, it bears very careful watching," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said this afternoon.
 
The Most Likely Successor

 
 The most likely successor is widely thought to be Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung's 52-year-old son, who has been groomed as the heir apparent. American officials here said they had seen nothing to dispute the report from Pyongyang Radio that the death of the 82-year-old North Korean leader was a result of a heart attack. But they expressed a sense of unease that it had come just at the outset of the new round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea.
That North Korea has also indicated that it does not intend to invite foreign leaders to attend Kim Il Sung's funeral also left American officials somewhat discomfited.
After offering "sincere condolences" to the people of North Korea, Mr. Clinton volunteered pointed praise today to the man who launched the Korean War for having shown "leadership" in the final months of his life by helping the talks to resume.
The President also said repeatedly that it was "in the interest of both countries" that the talks continue so the two countries might take further steps to resolve their dispute over North Korea's apparent efforts to build nuclear weapons.
That sentiment was echoed by Mr. Clinton's top national security advisers, who made clear that a willingness to proceed along the path set by Kim Il Sung would be regarded as a crucial test of good faith on the part of any new regime.

 
 
American Exasperation

 
 But as the gathering here was sent lurching by the need to grapple with that new challenge, officials also spoke with exasperation about the way events in Haiti, the currency markets and now North Korea had intruded on a setting they had envisioned as a showcase for American economic vitality.
Even more than questions about American policy toward Haiti dominated Mr. Clinton's first news conference here on Friday evening, questions about North Korea all but consumed the session this evening.
In looking ahead to what they said could be a fateful next few weeks, American officials expressed concern that even if North Korea does agree to the resumption of the Geneva talks, it could well harden its negotiating stand in a way that could fracture the fragile basis for talks.
They said it might be important for International Atomic Energy Agency officials to confirm that North Korea intends to abide its pledge, first made to former President Jimmy Carter last month, to freeze its nuclear program.
The American delegation here was first informed of the announcement of Mr. Kim's death at 5:13 A.M. in a telephone call from the White House Situation Room. Mr. Christopher was awakened almost immediately, while Mr. Clinton was not told of the news until he arose after 6:30 A.M because "there was no immediate decision to be made," a senior Administration official said.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
China Praises Kim
 BEIJING, July 9 (Special to The New York Times) -- China, a longtime ally of North Korea, reported the death of Kim Il Sung in a straightforward account today by the official New China News Agency.
Statements from Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, other high-ranking Chinese officials and the Foreign Ministry praised Mr. Kim, expressed sorrow and cited Chinese-Korean friendship.
Mr. Deng's statement, according to the news agency, said in part: "The life of comrade Kim Il Sung was one devoted to the national liberation of Korean and the happiness of the Korean people, and one dedicated to the forging and development of Sino-Korean friendship. with the passing away of comrade Kim Il Sung, the Korean people lost a great leader and I, a close comrade in arms and comrade."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Russia Reacts Cautiously
 MOSCOW, July 9 (Special to The New York Times) -- Russia reacted cautiously to Mr. Kim's death, with President Boris N. Yeltsin issuing a statement of "deepfelt condolences."
A Russian Foreign Ministry official said that Mr. Kim's death "should not worsen Russian-Korean relations."

HEADLINE: River That Yielded Oysters May Harvest Tourism

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MAURICETOWN, N.J., July 7

 BODY:
As a river, the Maurice doesn't look like much at first -- broad and flat, snaking in lazy oxbows through the tidal marshland and sandy uplands of southern New Jersey to the shallow, shimmering Delaware Bay.
Yet the Maurice was a river to reckon with in New Jersey long before words like "suburbs" and "split level" and "turnpike" came to define the state. It was a highway for cotton for the mills of Millville, for bricks and hay, for sand headed for local glass factories. Above all it was host to the once-huge fleet of oyster boats, the shallow-draft schooners that raked the river and bay bottom for oysters once so plentiful that the Central New Jersey Railroad built a spur down the river to the packing plants at Bivalve and Shellpile to haul the oysters out to the tables of the world. 
 Now the oyster harvest is all but gone, a casualty of successive parasitic blights that wiped out the native oysters and clams after World War II. Yet the Maurice -- locally pronounced "Morris" -- has won a new distinction, one that says something about how the world has changed, and how it hasn't changed.
In December, President Clinton signed the law to designate 37 miles of the Maurice and its main tributaries, the Menantico and the Manumuskin, as the country's only river system whose banks are largely in private ownership to be designated for Federal protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
 
Fishermen Become Allies
 "This was precedent-setting for us, because these are private land rivers, and we went into the management study explicitly saying that the Federal Government was not going to acquire any land to protect these resource values," said Chuck Barscz, a planner in the National Park Service's Philadelphia office who specializes in wild and scenic river designations.
"We worked with local people so they could develop their own management plans, and one of the allies of the study were the fishermen, who were trying to protect the river because it is their livelihood."
Recreational and commercial fin fishing in the river and in Delaware Bay continues, as well as a limited version of oyster farming, which involves planting seed oysters and harvesting them when they mature.
New Jersey has one other river in the Wild and Scenic program, the Great Egg Harbor River. Because most of the Great Egg's area is already protected within the 1.1 million-acre Pinelands National Preserve, its designation was less a milestone for the Park Service, which administers the Federal program, Mr. Barscz said.
 
Big Brother Stays Out
 Under the Federal rules, all three townships containing the rivers, Commercial, Millville, and Maurice River, not only had to assent to the designation but also had to adopt matching land-use plans for the river areas. The local leaders overcame concerns about inviting new Federal regulations into one of the state's poorest regions. They agreed to the newfangled idea of a wild and scenic designation in hopes that restraints on shoreline development would help restore some of the wealth the river once produced, this time as a natural attraction in the nation's most densely populated state.
"We were for preserving the river, but we were concerned about Big Brother coming in with new regulations," said George Garrison, the Mayor of Commercial Township, who had at first held out against the designation. "Our township is financially depressed, there is very little economic basis here, and we had to make sure we weren't going to hurt the people who make their economic livelihood on the river and the bay."
Local boosters are talking about restoring one of the old fishing villages as a tourist draw to a part of the state that most people hardly know exists, perhaps creating a restoration yard for wooden ships, an oystering museum and other attractions.
 
'Those Rich Bird Watchers'
 "Eco-tourism, that's the answer," said Donald L. Fauerbach, who spent two decades with an oystering and ship-building concern on the Maurice before becoming executive director of the New Jersey Conference of Mayors. He helped found the group that spearheaded the designation drive, Citizens United to Preserve the Maurice and Its Tributaries.
"There were people who called us those rich bird watchers up on the river who wanted to keep the river to ourselves," he said, "but most of them came around to seeing this was a good plan for everyone."
Good also for the multifarious wildlife on the rivers and wetlands now under Federal protection. Good for the bald eagles that perch on snaggle-toothed pines, drawing bird watchers on silent paddle to the upper reaches of the Menantico, and ospreys, once nearly wiped out in the Maurice watershed by the DDT that farmers spread on their diked and drained tidewater fields.
Today, Mr. Fauerbach says there are 21 nesting pairs of ospreys up and down the river, their fledgling chicks ducking dutifully down into twiggy nests each time a parent squawks the warning of approaching humans.
 
Moral Support From Cedar
 In arrow arum and pickerelweed of the marshland, red-winged blackbirds, abundant as pigeons in Central Park, flash their improbably red chevrons against inky feathers. In the fall, the wild rice will turn brown and draw mobs of arctic wildfowl winging southward along the great Atlantic flyway.
At low tide, the slowly rotting skeletons of abandoned oyster boats can be seen resting in the mud, only their cedar wood frames for their dagger-board keels resisting decay, as if holding out for the new life the river's keepers hope will come with a Wild and Scenic designation.
"When the oysters died out, the captains were told to sail their boats up on the bank, strip them and leave them," Mr. Fauerbach said. "Think how they must have felt, rowing away. Now maybe we have a chance to bring some new activity back to this river."

Mr. Fauerbach and his daughter Karen fished on the river. (Laura Pedrick for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: The Year in Albany: Results of the 217th Session of the Legislature

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 9

 BODY:
In an election year when the governorship and all 211 legislative seats are up for grabs, the New York State Legislature recessed its 217th session last Sunday at 11:20 A.M. with a number of major issues unaddressed. After failing to pass a budget until 69 days after the start of the fiscal year, the session ended in such disarray that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo immediately asked the Legislature to return later this summer.
Lawmakers were unable to reach agreements on creating a sentence of life without parole for third-time violent felons, on banning assault weapons, on a constitutional amendment to allow casino gambling, on finding ways to store low-level radioactive waste and on repealing the Wicks Law, which inflates government construction costs by requiring four separate subcontracts for each project. 
 The major accomplishments of the session were bills that would require the police to make arrests in domestic-violence cases, would toughen penalties for drunken driving, would ban smoking on school grounds and would expand the government's authority to compel mentally ill people into treatment.
The Assembly passed 1,565 of the 2,798 bills introduced in that house, while the Senate passed 1,514 of 2,585 bills introduced. A total of 792 bills passed both houses. Of those, Mr. Cuomo has as of today signed 286 and vetoed 7. As usual, many of the votes came in a last-minute flurry.
Following are the major actions of the session.
 
The Budget
 No one blinked when, for the 10th consecutive year, the Legislature missed the April 1 legal deadline for passing a budget. But few expected the battle to go on so long: the final plan was not adopted until June 8, making this the second-latest budget in state history.
In contrast to budget battles in recent years, when lawmakers disagreed over what cuts to make, the tussle this year was over how to spend a $1 billion surplus. In the end, the spending plan included $322 million for constructing and refurbishing sports stadiums and schools, $550 million in additional aid to school districts and $470 million in tax cuts, mostly for businesses.
The budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year, including all Federal money, totals $63.2 billion, an increase of 9.2 percent from the previous year. The general-fund budget, which includes most state tax and fee collections, is $34.2 billion, an increase of 7.3 percent.
The budget provided $44 million for prison programs, including the conversion of Gowanda Psychiatric Center near Buffalo into a 750-bed medium-security prison, the first expansion of the system since 1991.
In the course of budget negotiations, legislative leaders rejected two Cuomo ideas: creating a new keno lottery game and collecting $70 million each year in unclaimed bottle deposits to finance park improvements and environmental projects. The lawmakers also scaled back Mr. Cuomo's proposal to open boarding schools for gifted science and math high school students from across the state, agreeing only to a special school for students from the Albany area.

HEADLINE: How a Shubert Fund Produces and Directs

SERIES: Backstage Drama: The Shubert Foundation -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Along 44th Street west of the throb of Broadway, marquees trumpet the latest theatrical offerings and the din of voices animates the street. In the midst of this strip of theaters, out of cramped offices above Sardi's restaurant, the Shubert Foundation discharges its philanthropic glow, handing out grants: $100,000 to the Actors Theater of Louisville, $5,000 to the Indiana Repertory Theater and on and on, perpetuating its standing, in volume of grants and quantity of unrestricted money, as the country's largest private financial supporter of nonprofit theater.
But the Shubert Foundation has long been more than it appears, although keeps its operations purposely in the shadows. The foundation is not just an altruistic extension of the Shubert Organization, the country's most powerful owner and operator of legitimate theaters, home of hits ranging from "Oklahoma!" to "A Chorus Line" to "Cats." Thanks to a little-known and highly unusual tax arrangement, the foundation actually owns the Shubert Organization and dictates who runs it. 
 That arrangement, the result of a 1979 Internal Revenue Service ruling, is not simply an arcane matter. Without the ruling -- or an alternative remedy -- the Shubert empire would have had to be dismantled, in the way that the Kellogg Foundation had to relinquish control of the cereal company. Without it, the Shubert Foundation would undoubtedly not have grown and prospered so. Without it, the two rulers of the entire Shubert realm -- Gerald Schoenfeld and Bernard B. Jacobs -- would not have had their reign prolonged and preserved.
These days, the foundation is entering a pivotal stage. Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs are not young. Mr. Schoenfeld is 69. Mr. Jacobs is 78. Who their successors will be is a subject of intense speculation in the theater world. But Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs have no inclination to retire nor have they identified any succession plan. Lee J. Seidler, a Shubert Foundation director, said recently with total conviction, "Both of those guys are going to die in their chairs."
The two men sit atop a formidable cultural and real-estate empire whose fate has considerable bearing on the American theater and the civic health of New York City. Broadway theater alone generates an estimated $2.4 billion a year for the city's economy.
The Shubert empire owns or operates 16 Broadway theaters (and is co-owner of a 17th), half of the existing houses, as well as four theaters in other cities and additional plum Manhattan property. Thus, what happens to the dominion once the Gerry and Bernie show finally closes will affect a crucial section of New York -- Times Square -- which, after years of fits and starts, seems on the brink of extensive redevelopment. Any change in the enterprise -- particularly if it no longer remains fundamentally a theater business -- would also have a profound influence on the direction of the Broadway theater at a time of hand wringing over its well-being and, through Shubert Foundation grants, on the entire fragile infrastructure of the American theater. Everything, from what shows come to Broadway, to what stagehands make, to what price theatergoers pay for a ticket, is mightily affected by the Shubert kingdom.
The foundation's wealth, conservatively estimated at $149 million, makes it one of the nation's largest. The Foundation Center, which tracks charities, ranks it 169th in assets among the country's more than 35,000 foundations, though well below front-runners like the Ford Foundation, whose worth bulges into the billions. In May, the Shubert Foundation announced record 1994 grants of $6 million, $3.5 million of which benefited theater, most of the remainder going to dance groups and arts institutions.
But its greater significance lies in the iron-handed control it exerts over the Shubert theater empire. Such an arrangement, in which a sizable for-profit business, the Shubert theaters, belongs to a nonprofit private foundation, is extraordinarily rare and is almost always forbidden under Federal tax laws. Pamela Mann, the head of the charity division of the New York State Attorney General's office, said she knows of no similar setup. Neither does John Edie, legal counsel for the Council on Foundations, the foundation trade organization.
A simple relationship endures between the theater organization and the foundation. The board of the Shubert Foundation, the entity with the power to choose successors to Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs, is composed of six rather disparate men. These same individuals also constitute the board of the Shubert Organization. They faithfully re-elect one another year after year. Eight or nine times annually, they convene for their Shubert Foundation board meeting, then, without leaving their seats, reconvene for their Shubert Organization meeting.
For two decades Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs, collectively known as "the Shuberts," have perched at the helm of this integrated empire, serving as chairman and president, respectively, of both boards. They are said to earn $1 million each, plus bonuses that could approach their salaries, all paid directly by the Shubert Organization and not required to be disclosed in Shubert Foundation public filings.
The other board members are, surprisingly, not otherwise connected to the theater: John W. Kluge, is chairman of Metromedia Inc. and among the country's richest men; Irving M. Wall is a lawyer; Lee Seidler is a retired accounting expert, and Michael I. Sovern, the former president of Columbia University, is a law professor there.
Age and illness have figured significantly in Mr. Schoenfeld's and Mr. Jacobs's careers. They ultimately vaulted to the top of the theater empire in an unruly power struggle among irreconcilable directors of the foundation. In no small way, this was precipitated by the failure of the founding Shubert brothers -- Sam, Lee and J. J., who established their theatrical kingdom in the early 20th century -- to orchestrate an orderly transition. Now many in the theater community wonder if a similar untidy duel may someday be in the offing: dead hands of the past reaching into the future.
Asked about succession, Mr. Schoenfeld said: "That is a private matter. I won't talk about it." In an interview some years ago, Mr. Jacobs said: "Of all the things in the world I think the least about, it's what happens after you die. Dead is dead."
This is the story of the Shubert Foundation, not the theatrical organization, though one shapes the other. While Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs have talked volubly about their shows over the years, they have rarely spoken about the foundation. Since a fusillade of corruption charges battered the foundation in the 1970's, the two have been loath to raise its decidedly low profile. Recently, however, they agreed to discuss their role in it during extensive interviews at the resplendent Shubert offices, in Shubert Alley, across from the foundation headquarters, where exquisite wood paneling, French tapestries and Chinese screens overwhelm the eye.
The evolution of the foundation is a convoluted drama wrapped in the permutations of family, with untimely intermissions for scandal and legal encumbrances. The foundation started small and unheralded. Death, above all, made it something else entirely.
 
A Foundation Is Born
No Safer Place To Keep Money
 On June 28, 1945, Lee and J. J. Shubert quietly formed the Sam S. Shubert Foundation (its name was shortened in 1971), ostensibly to honor their deceased brother, Sam. They had waited 40 years past his death to extend the tribute, but then it is widely assumed that the true motivation, as with many foundations, was to lighten their income taxes and eventual estate taxes. In their wills, the brothers made it clear that they wanted the foundation ultimately to own the theaters. In short, they wished to stockpile their wealth where no one -- especially the Government -- could get it.
The foundation's stated mission was a broad one -- to carry on religious, scientific, literary and educational work, and to give away money for educational purposes. A press release at the time reported that it had assets of $500,000 and intended to contribute to religious charities. The original board consisted of Lee, J. J., John Shubert (J. J.'s son), Dora Wolf (Lee and J. J.'s sister) and three Shubert lawyers.
For quite a while, the foundation did not dispense much money -- nor did it have to. Before the Tax Reform Act of 1969, there were no enforceable requirements for how much foundations had to give away. As Mr. Seidler phrased it: "It was a wonderful way of putting money into limbo." (Today, foundations must distribute an average of 5 percent of their assets annually.)
For years, the Shubert Foundation remained a small arm of the brothers' theater business, its assets no more than a few million dollars. The deaths of Lee and J. J. Shubert changed that.
Lee, who was childless, died in 1953. Control of his stake in the various Shubert companies that made up the Shubert Organization passed to J. J., but Lee left the bulk of his estate to the foundation, more than doubling its worth, to around $7 million.
Lee's passing was the first of a parade of deaths that would provide exceptional opportunity to Gerald Schoenfeld and Bernard Jacobs. When Lee was alive, Shubert legal affairs had been handled by the firm of Klein & Weir. William Klein was the overseeing attorney and Milton Weir was the day-to-day man. However, J. J., the querulous sole surviving brother, disliked Mr. Weir. He anointed as the daily lawyer another member of the firm named Adolph Lund. The company of Klein & Lund was formed, and it set up shop in the Shubert offices.
Mr. Lund had two clients: Shubert and a hanger maker. He, in turn, enlisted help from a junior lawyer named Gerald Schoenfeld, a cherubic, earnest New Yorker whose father made fur coats. When Mr. Lund died on New Year's Day of 1957, at the age of 49, his premature death left Mr. Schoenfeld as the primary Shubert lawyer; he also took over the hanger maker.
For months, J. J. never paid Mr. Schoenfeld a cent. "He hadn't mentioned salary yet, and I couldn't ask him," Mr. Schoenfeld said. "The way things worked, you had to wait until J. J. brought the subject up."
After a few months, J. J. told Mr. Schoenfeld he ought to recruit another attorney. Mr. Schoenfeld mentioned the opening to Mr. Jacobs, a crusty, somber-looking lawyer who was in practice with his brother, largely handling jewelers. Both the Schoenfelds and the Jacobs lived on the West Side of Manhattan, and, despite the nine-year difference in their ages, the two men had known each other since they were young, for Mr. Jacobs was best friends with Mr. Schoenfeld's older brother.
Mr. Jacobs joined Shubert on St. Patrick's Day of 1958. As a welcoming gesture, J. J. made it clear to Mr. Schoenfeld that he would be held directly accountable for anything Mr. Jacobs did wrong.
By the early 1960's, J. J. was in such delicate health that direction of the Shubert operations had essentially passed to John Shubert, his only child, who was considered a fairly adept businessman. But John met an unexpected death from heart failure in late 1962, at the age of 53. The only relative of the Shuberts active in the business was Lawrence Shubert Lawrence, a grandnephew of the Shubert brothers and a man felt to have highly dubious managerial qualifications.
Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs said they contemplated seizing power themselves, but a lawyer advised them it would be unseemly. And so, Mr. Lawrence was anointed president of both the organization and the foundation.
In 1963, a catalytic moment arrived for the foundation. At 83, J. J. Shubert died. His will turned over the bulk of his estate, including the theaters, to the foundation. This meant that for the first time ownership of the vast theater network would pass from the family to the foundation and cause the theater organization to become subservient to the foundation. Henceforth, the foundation -- and those who led it -- would wield all the power.
 
A Weak Leader Reigns
The Empire Teeters
 The early 1970's were not merry times for the Shubert Foundation. They brought upheaval, scandal and many pilgrimages to court. In no small way did this evolve out of the soothing companionship of a liquor bottle.
Mr. Lawrence quickly demonstrated how ill suited he was to run the Shubert companies. Under his watch, the business foundered. He also had a major-league drinking problem. "He was not the most competent person in the world," Mr. Jacobs said. "And he suffered from the fact that 22 out of 24 hours a day he had more liquor in his system than he should have." Year after year, particularly after blockbuster hits like "Fiddler on the Roof" had run their course, the theater business lost money, propped up only by income from real-estate holdings.
The enterprise was teetering. The power structure was about to be rearranged.
By 1971, deaths had whittled the foundation board down to two directors: Mr. Lawrence and Kerttu (Ecky) Shubert, the widow of John Shubert. Mrs. Shubert did not much care for Mr. Lawrence, but she favored Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs.
Two directors was one fewer than required by the foundation's certificate of incorporation. According to statements Mr. Lawrence made in court papers (he died in 1992), he had a running dispute with Mrs. Shubert over appointing additional independent directors. Eventually, State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz, who had regulatory authority over foundations, began to impose pressure of his own. New directors would be crucial choices because the foundation directors, for the first time, could choose who would run the entire theater and real estate enterprise.
After much discord, a bargain was struck. To satisfy Mrs. Shubert, Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs would be nominated to the board. Mr. Lawrence's nominees were his lawyer, Irving Wall, and Irving Goldman, a well-connected businessman who, as a boy selling paints used for scenery, had got to know J. J.
With the support of the other directors, Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs quickly revised the foundation's certificate of incorporation. One key change involved members' terms. The original certificate had bestowed life terms. Now, the six members as of Aug. 26, 1971, would serve for life, and those subsequently elected would have one-year terms. In a clarification added later, it was stated that the initial six directors could never be removed -- for any reason whatsoever.
Granting directors life terms is unusual among foundations, experts in the field say, and this action was subsequently pointedly criticized by the Attorney General's office.
 
Enter Irving Goldman
The Strategy Of a Takeover
 By now, Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs had concluded that the organization could no longer countenance Mr. Lawrence and his ineptness. So they made a Faustian pact involving Irving Goldman.
Mr. Jacobs said he never really cared for Mr. Goldman. Mr. Schoenfeld described him this way: "The Pope? He would know the Pope. The King of England? He would know the King of England. The truth is, you never knew if he knew anybody."
One thing they did know: the man had a thirst for power. And so the two lawyers offered him a deal too good to turn down: if he voted with them to oust Mr. Lawrence, he would share the power with them and become head of the Shubert Foundation.
In June 1972, the board deposed Mr. Lawrence as head of the organization and the foundation, although he remained a director. His power was invested in the triumverate -- Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Goldman. It was vaguely decided that Mr. Schoenfeld would reign over the nontheatrical real estate, most theater union negotiations and pensions, while theater operations and the selection of shows became largely the province of Mr. Jacobs. Mr. Goldman was put in charge of the foundation, vendors used by the theaters and theater maintenance.
Once in command, Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Schoenfeld said they found the Shubert operations more parlous than they had thought. There was no cash, the place was going broke, and half the Broadway houses were dark.
To resurrect the kingdom, they began investing in some shows to get them into their theaters. And they undertook a search for money-making productions. Within months, one came their way: "Pippin." Its rousing success gave them breathing room. In 1974 they booked "Equus," and more money poured in. They began refurbishing the theaters, then in deplorable shape, updated sales practices to allow tickets to be paid for by check or credit card and bought over the telephone, and spearheaded a reclamation effort of the seedy Times Square area.
Then, in July 1975, they had the great good fortune to put a musical named "A Chorus Line," which Joseph Papp had produced downtown, in the Shubert Theater. It blossomed into a remarkable money machine that spewed forth millions of dollars and solidified the Shubert empire.
Meanwhile, an incensed Mr. Lawrence had sued Mr. Schoenfeld, Mr. Jacobs and the other directors in State Supreme Court in January 1973 to regain control; he accused Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs of a conspiracy to seize power. The suit was dismissed because it had been filed too late.
But the Lawrence rumblings led Attorney General Lefkowitz to undertake an investigation of the foundation. In March 1974, he filed civil charges against the executors of J. J.'s estate as well as Mr. Schoenfeld, Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Lawrence, saying there had been millions of dollars of "grossly excessive, unjustified and unreasonable" claims. He charged the Shubert officials with conflicts of interest that he maintained had deprived the foundation of millions of dollars.
Once again, the consequences of sickness and death favored Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs. The assistant attorney general handling the case became ill and retired. Surrogate S. Samuel DiFalco, under whose jurisdiction the estate case fell, reached retirement age and soon died.
The merits of the Lefkowitz case were never judged in court, because several years later the Attorney General withdrew the charges in return for the executors and lawyers of J. J. Shubert's estate agreeing to reduce their claims by $2 million. That money then passed to the foundation.
So Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs had moved into power. "There was a weak king," said Foster Hirsch, the author of a forthcoming book on the Shuberts entitled "The Boys From Syracuse." "They took power away from the weak king. They did what anybody else would have done."
 
The Goldman Affair
Painting Himself Into a Corner
 Next on stage was the Goldman imbroglio.
Under Mr. Goldman's supervision, the Shubert Foundation gave out little money, and, according to people familiar with his tenure, quite a few of the grants were awarded to Mr. Goldman's pet interests. For example, he liked the City of Hope, a California medical institution, so it got handsome donations.
Along with serving as president of the Shubert Foundation, Mr. Goldman also, unexpectedly, became New York's cultural affairs commissioner under Mayor Beame. By early 1974, however, reports started to circulate about possibly illegal business dealings by Mr. Goldman, and the Attorney General began investigating him. Around this time, an article in The New York Times disclosed that a Shubert Foundation grant to the Yale School of Drama was sharply reduced after Mr. Goldman complained that Yale was not buying paint from a concern he owned. Chairmen at other drama departments also reported that Mr. Goldman had mentioned his paint company when discussing grants.
All of this brought considerable opprobrium to the Shubert Foundation. It needed new directors with unblemished reputations, and a search produced three people: Helen Hollerith, a trustee of the Kips Bay Boys' Club in the Bronx; John Kluge, then head of Metromedia but a few billion dollars short of what he's worth now, and Lee Seidler. They joined the board in January 1975.
Matters worsened for Mr. Goldman. In March 1975, he was indicted by a special state grand jury on grand larceny charges that he had defrauded the Transit Authority. In April 1975, he was indicted by a Federal grand jury on similar charges. In October 1975, he was indicted on charges that he had bribed a witness to disappear to avoid testifying before a grand jury investigating allegations that Mr. Goldman had improperly funneled money from the Shubert Foundation. The indictment also charged that Mr. Goldman had given $1 million in contracts to a Queens company to paint Shubert theaters and that the paint company had returned half the profits as kickbacks.
With three indictments hanging over him, Mr. Goldman was not an ideal foundation president. It was clear to Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Jacobs that he had to go. "The price of getting rid of Lawrence was Goldman," Mr. Jacobs said ruefully. "We didn't know how high the price would be."
Under pressure from Mr. Lefkowitz, the directors had in June 1974 amended the foundation's certificate of incorporation to specify that directors were to serve year to year, rather than for life. They also revised the rules so that one-third of the board -- or just two members -- would constitute a quorum and a majority vote of the directors present could transact business.
Although Mr. Goldman truculently refused to leave, he was without allies. The day after he was indicted for the third time, the Shubert board severed him from his duties. As it turned out, he was never convicted of any crimes. With the passage of time, Mr. Goldman's health unraveled steadily and prosecutors lost interest in bringing him to trial. He died in 1983 at the age of 73.
Tomorrow: The Favorable Tax Ruling
Pugnacious they were, but the Shubert brothers certainly had spunk. The boys from Syracuse, as they were called (even though they were actually born in Poland), were Sam, Jacob (known as J. J. or Jake) and Lee, sons of a Syracuse peddler named David Shubert. In the late 1800's, before they had entered their 20's, the brothers formed a stock company that blossomed into a mini-theater chain in upstate New York. In 1900, Sam descended on New York City and decided it suited him, and the brothers began operating theaters there. They were scampish, ruthless men of outsized ambition, and they quickly booked a string of hit shows.
 Sam was the first to die. On May 11, 1905, he boarded a train bound for Pittsburgh. It crashed, and the next day he was gone. He was believed to be 29.
 With Sam dead, the empire was led by Lee and J. J. The brothers bought sizable swaths of real estate and theaters in midtown Manhattan as well as in Boston and other cities. Virtually alone, they built New York's theater district. By 1927 they owned an astonishing 104 theaters and booked shows in 1,000 more. If you liked theater, you were beholden to the tastes of the Shuberts.
Their grip on theater was so absolute that in early 1950 the Federal Government filed an antitrust action asserting that the Shuberts monopolized their industry. The brothers eventually agreed to divest 12 theaters, depart the booking business and not buy any theaters without the Government's blessing. That was a lot to lose, but a lot was left. Indeed, Shubert steamed ahead as the most powerful theater organization in the country.
Lee Shubert died on Christmas Day 1953 at the age of 78, leaving J. J. as the sovereign. J. J. could be winsome and he could be vituperative -- often in the space of minutes. This was never lost on Bernard B. Jacobs and Gerald Schoenfeld, his lawyers and eventual successors. Once, J. J. called in Mr. Jacobs and told him to fire Mr. Schoenfeld. "Then I forgot about it and he forgot about it," Mr. Jacobs recalled. "You never knew if he was serious or if he was playing games." N.R.K.

HEADLINE: The World;
When Neighbors Aren't Friends

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

 BODY:
FOR nearly three years now, the United States has confronted a tide of Haitian refugees whose management has gone well beyond its considerable logistical challenges to become a sore on the conscience of a country that cherishes an image of itself as warm and welcoming to foreigners.
As scenes of Haitians being stockaded in sweltering tent cities have become commonplace, a moral question has arisen in Washington: Is it just the Haitians' blackness and poverty that causes them to be treated differently from, say, Vietnamese, Russians or Cubans? And one truth that gets lost in the heat and fog of debate is this: The question could just as easily be asked in the capitals of the Caribbean, albeit with different perspectives on race and racism. 
 Lost in the reflection and debate over the United States' handling of the more than 50,000 Haitians who have fled their country since the September 1991 military coup that overthrew the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide has been the cool treatment reserved for Haitians throughout the hemisphere.
Other nations have shown more rhetorical zeal than the United States in supporting Father Aristide, but 34 months into Haiti's crisis the United States, for all its perceived stinginess toward them, remains the only country that has willingly been host to sizable numbers of refugees who have fled what Haiti's President calls "a house on fire." Last week Panama provided the most dramatic example of the cold feet Haiti's other neighbors get when asked to help temporarily shoulder the burden of the crisis in Haiti. Just days after the outgoing President, Guillermo Endara, agreed to receive as many as 10,000 Haitians on Panamanian soil, he abruptly canceled the arrangement. Mr. Endara complained that the United States had sought to shift the terms of the agreement without prior consultation, but few could doubt that a political firestorm in Panama about the presence of large numbers of Haitians was a major factor in his decision.
Panama is far from alone in its ambivalence. Venezuela announced at a recent foreign ministers' meeting in Brazil that it would be willing to receive Haitian refugees, only to quietly withdraw the offer a few days later. More recently, Washington asked Jamaica to help out with the refugee problem. The best American diplomats were able to obtain was an agreement for a leased hospital ship, the Comfort, to process Haitian refugees in Kingston harbor. Even this raised hackles in Jamaica, with the opposition Labor Party objecting, saying that Haiti's refugees were "a U.S. problem."
"There was initially a wave of public concern that some of these people could jump ship and swim ashore," said Canute James, a Jamaican journalist, referring to the public aversion to the plan. "A lot of this, I believe is simply racist. Although Haiti is in the middle of the Caribbean, most people know very little about Haitians. They may as well be from the other side of the world." Implicit in Mr. James's remarks is that the term "racist" can apply not just to skin color but to peculiarities of culture, language and nationality as well.
Haitians, who have long thought of themselves as awkwardly fitting into Latin America, have themselves begun to recognize this cultural isolation as one of the most underrated elements in the country's seemingly perpetual political troubles.
Beyond the country's blackness and poverty, Haiti is the only French-speaking country in Latin America, and its Creole, the universal language of daily life, throws a further shroud of impenetrability over the land.
 
A Revolutionary History
 A proud revolutionary history, moreover, has made many Haitians scornful and prickly toward foreigners, particularly those Caribbean neighbors, also with dark skin, whose colonial status only began to end in the 1960's.
Told recently that soldiers from small neighboring islands might participate in a Haitian peacekeeping force, one Haitian intellectual cried, "Anything would be preferable to being subjected to people like those, without history, without souls."
Haitians realize that, as much as the continuing boat people crisis, it is because their fate has captured the attention of black America, whose political leaders have refused to allow the issue to die, that their troubles have remained on the political front-burner in the United States all these months. But if they are unaccustomed to solidarity like this, Haitians say they have quickly learned its lessons: As Haitians have settled in the United States in recent years, their country has become less and less a Latin, or even Caribbean nation, in its cultural identity.
Instead, Haitians have begun to tie their fates to the United States. And as Haitian-Americans grow in number, both returning to their country for visits and becoming politically active in the United States, they will increasingly determine the direction their homeland takes.
"The black American relationship has already proven to be extremely important to us," said Lionel Delatour, a Haitian political scientist who has written on the subject. "Now what we will increasingly see is the 300,000 Haitians born in the United States who are black Americans as well as Haitian-Americans serving as a vital bridge. That is our hope for modernizing, politically, culturally and economically."

HEADLINE: Word for Word/The Three Stooges;
Thoughts on the Social Significance Of Getting Hit With a Pie. Seriously.

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
THE Three Stooges never showed much respect for high-falutin' types like college professors. Funny, then, that the world of academe today is displaying serious deference to them, this trio of manic numbskulls who ran amok before the cameras from the 1930's to the 1960's and frequently made slapstick violence so hilarious it hurt.
Foremost among academic Stooge experts -- admittedly, there are not many -- is one Donald B. Morlan, Ph.D., professor of communications and a comedy film historian at the University of Dayton in Ohio, whose insights on the wider social and political significance of Moe, Larry and Curly (and Shemp, Curly Joe and Joe Besser) are such that he is once again a featured participant at the annual Three Stooges Convention, being held this weekend at the Ramada in Trevose, Pa., outside Philadelphia. 
 There, the 60th anniversary of the Stooges' first Columbia film shorts will be observed with requisite solemnity, and Dr. Morlan will hold forth on the Stooges' contributions to World War II film propaganda. But for those who can do without loitering in a hotel lobby with a bunch of barking Curly imitators and guys in Moe haircuts trying to poke their eyes out -- and for those who cannot -- here are excerpts from Dr. Morlan's scholarly research. TOM KUNTZ

 
Anti-Aristocratic
 From "A Pie in the Face: The Three Stooges' Anti-Aristocracy Theme in Depression-Era American Film," delivered to the Popular Culture Association, Bowling Green (Ohio) State University, April 1994:
The original intent of the current research was to examine the 190 Columbia Stooges' shorts to answer pertinent questions relating to the pie fights. Specifically, purposes were to determine the frequency of pie fights, to draw any conclusions evident as to the "victims" of the pies, and to search for any existent social themes . . .
Results of the search were quite surprising. This paper will answer the three questions posed; however, the most significant result of this effort was that the Three Stooges were major contributors to the anti-aristocracy/wealth theme so prevalent in Depression-era films. Just as the Stooges contributed to anti-Nazi sentiment in America in the late 30's and early 40's, they also made significant contributions to uplifting the morale of Americans during the economic crisis of the Great Depression.
Most likely surprising to many "Stoogemaniacs," bona fide pie fights occurred in only five of the 190 Columbia comedies. The first such battle appeared in "In the Sweet Pie and Pie" (1941), which found the boys marrying three society girls immediately prior to being hanged. When they are pardoned, the girls attempt to embarrass the boys at a high society party. Perennial supporting actress, Symona Boniface, who appeared in all the pie fight comedies, threw the very first pie in a Stooge short subject.
 Perhaps also surprising to many Stooge fans is that Curly appeared in only one pie fight -- the first. "Half Wits Holiday" (1947), which introduced the classic fight to be seen many more times (as stock footage in later pie-fight shorts), was Curly's final comedy with the team and the concluding pie fight scene was shot without him -- presumably following his stroke on the set.
 The victims of the pies, without exception, were the wealthy in "hoity-toity" social settings. As indicated earlier, Symona Boniface, one of the most popular short subject supporting actresses of the time, was involved in all the pie fights. Even though she was an active participant, she was always the clear victim of the melees. Her society friends and party guests were also victimized with a pie in the face.
 The recurring social theme in all the pie throwing comedies was that of anti-aristocracy and wealth which was so popular in Depression-era films. Plots were quite repetitive. Low-life ruffians were thrust into high-society settings and quickly made a shambles of the elitist climate. The result in each case was the same -- society matrons and patrons were quickly relegated to the level of the ruffians and made to look foolish.
The recurring theme in the pie fight comedies prompted a deeper and more analytical examination of all 190 films for thematic significance in the era of the Depression. The result of that search was that the Stooges -- amid their slapstick nonsense -- were making a meaningful and calculated contribution to the prevailing political climate of the time.
 
War Propaganda
 From "Slapstick Comedy Contributions to Pre-WWII Film Propaganda: The Three Stooges and Abbott & Costello," delivered to the American Culture Association and Popular Culture Association meeting in New Orleans, April 10, 1993:
The role of the motion picture industry in furthering the national interest in World War II has received heavy documentation in the past. Most attention, however, has been focused on the filmmakers' contributions to the war effort via celluloid propagandizing intended to build public morale in favor of America's involvement -- after that involvement was initiated.
 [Before the United States' entry into the war] persistent and heated attacks on the motion picture industry . . . came from the isolationists/America Firsters -- particularly those in the United States Senate. Perhaps having grown frustrated with the increasing failure of their attempts to curb interventionist sentiment in the Roosevelt Administration, the American press and the public at large, the motion picture industry became their focal target in mid-1941.
Senators Gerald P. Nye of North Dakota, Burton K. Wheeler of Montana and Bennet Clark of Missouri became leaders in a Congressional attack on the movie industry. On Aug. 1, 1941, Nye and Clark called on the Senate's Committee on Interstate Commerce to investigate the "sordid story of war propaganda in the film."
 Senators Nye and Clark's efforts were successful in the creation of a specially impaneled subcommittee of the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee to investigate "war propaganda disseminated by the distribution, or exhibition of motion pictures." Senator Nye was the chief spokesperson for the isolationist cause and the lead-off witness. Heads of most major studios were called to appear to defend charges against the industry.
The committee targeted 39 motion pictures and nine episodes of the [newsreel] "The March of Time" as being the most offensive in their propagandistic content. None of the movies listed by the subcommittee were comedies; however, Charles Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" was among an additional list of offensive titles cited in Senator Nye's opening testimony.
 The apparent elitist attitude of the isolationist Senators in assessing propagandistic value of films by type, i.e., "quality" pictures as opposed to slapstick, etc., may have been a great mistake. Slapstick comedy was immensely popular as an art form in the late 30's and early 40's. . . . Three Stooges comedies played to far more patrons than a single film due to the practice of showing short subjects with a variety of feature films in multiple theaters in a single market.
The historical significance of the three Stooges' propagandistic war efforts cannot be fully appreciated until the comedies are placed in chronological perspective with other events occurring in the country at the time. The Stooges were virtually "getting away with murder" at a time when even the slightest hint of anti-Nazi sentiment in a feature film was sure to draw the wrath of the isolationists.
"You Nazty Spy," the 44th in the series of 190 Columbia Stooges shorts, was released to theaters on Jan. 19, 1940 -- nearly two years prior to the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and at a time when any serious effort to pan Germany or Hitler would receive immediate opposition. "You Nazty Spy" beat Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" to the screen by nine months and, contrary to the belief of many film historians, it was Moe Howard who was the first film actor to ridicule Hitler on the screen and not the immortal Chaplin.

HEADLINE: Playing Poker: Clinton Says Economy Is All Aces

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NAPLES, July 9

 BODY:
President Clinton has often been accused of timidity in foreign policy, but the policy on the dollar that he articulated here at this year's economic summit meeting is about as gutsy as anything he could do these days short of invading Haiti.
When all the oratory is stripped away, the President has essentially looked the world's currency traders in the eye and said to them, "I dare you." 
 That dare is embodied in Mr. Clinton's argument that the United States economy is as healthy as ever, that inflation is well under control and that the currency markets have to some degree undervalued the dollar.
For those reasons, the President said, if at all possible he is not going to prop up the dollar.
 
What Clinton Doesn't Want
 He said he does not want to see the Federal Reserve Board raise interest rates to support the dollar because that would needlessly damp domestic growth, and he is counting on the markets to eventually recognize the fundamentals and stabilize the dollar at a reasonably strong value.
He is also betting that this process will take place without any serious long-term negative effects on the American economy.
As bets go, they don't get much bigger. If Mr. Clinton and his advisers are right, some speculators who have been dumping dollars by the bushel are going to lose money. If he is wrong, the dollar, and maybe stocks and bonds, are in for a very interesting ride.
The last world leader to take on the currency markets in such a brazen way was Prime Minister John Major, who declared in 1992 that the British pound would be devalued only "over my dead body." Currency traders took up the bet, hammered the pound down by 15 percent and left Mr. Major's body as roadkill on the global investment highway.
 
The Parallels That Aren't
 In fairness to Mr. Clinton, the pound was overvalued and the American economy today is in much better health than Britain's was then.
But how much better? Americans will soon find out as currency traders and the President engage in a fundamental test of wills over whose assessment is correct.
Many speculators have argued that a lot of fundamentals point to a weaker dollar: Japan and Germany are coming out of recession, which means interest rates there are likely to rise, making investments there more attractive and increasing demand for their currencies.
In the United States, strong employment numbers from the Labor Department suggest that inflation might soon rise. The trade deficit with Japan is heading for another record this year. And maybe most important, there is no sign of a Japanese Government that is ready or able to deal with the endemic trade surplus.
 
Good News and Bad News
 Most Clinton aides walked away from the President's meeting on Friday with Japan's new Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, saying there was good news and bad news.
The good news, they said, was that the first Socialist Prime Minister of Japan in more than four decades seemed just like every other Japanese Prime Minister, despite his reputation as a radical pacifist with almost no foreign experience.
The bad news, the officials said, was that the first Socialist Prime Minister of Japan in more than four decades seemed just like every other Japanese Prime Minister -- with lots of vague promises about opening Japanese markets and deregulating Japan's economy but without any specifics that might make these happen.
In citing economic fundamentals that support the dollar, the President and his advisers say that $500 billion in budget cuts have finally brought the deficit under control, and that the United States economy has generated 3.8 million jobs in the last 17 months without any real sign of serious inflation.
With Japan coming out of recession, they add, demand for American products there should increase (presuming the markets open up), and the dollar should therefore strengthen against the yen. Moreover, while the dollar is losing ground against the yen and the mark, it is holding steady against other currencies.
 
And if Clinton Is Wrong?
 As Mr. Clinton said Friday: "Over the long run, the economic fundamentals will have to work themselves out. And I think that the best thing to do to stabilize the dollar and other currencies is to send a signal to the markets that we are working on the economic fundamentals. These things, it seems to me, together offer the promise of strengthening the dollar over the long run in a realistic way."
Anyway, the President hinted, if he is wrong and the fundamentals are not as strong as he thinks, no amount of intervention in the markets will be sufficient to hold up the currency.
Not surprisingly, many speculators interpreted these remarks as a definitive signal that there would be no market intervention or interest-rate increases unless markets really started gyrating. That is why the dollar fell again on Friday against the yen and the mark.
Over the long term, if the President is right, the economic fundamentals -- employment, inflation, interest rates -- will remain sound and the markets will stabilize the dollar at or above its current level.
If the traders are right, the dollar will continue to fall, foreign investors will pull more money out of United States stock and bond markets and things could get increasingly disorderly.
 
The Specter of Greenspan
 "The Administration is betting that they are right about the economic fundamentals, that the markets will adjust, and that this adjustment will be relatively painless for the American economy," said John P. Lipsky, chief economist for Salomon Brothers. "The risk, which we have seen in dollar weaknesses in the past, is that market adjustments can involve overshooting and overselling, which produces undesirable economic effects."
The key unknown element is the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan. The Administration can think whatever it wants about the fundamentals, but if Mr. Greenspan thinks they are eroding, he can raise interest rates himself, independent of the Admnistration.
So that is the poker game: Bill Clinton at the table with the currency traders. Each has chips in the pot. The traders have a pretty good idea what the President has in his hand, since he is not a very good bluffer. But the wild card is that fellow Greenspan standing at the President's shoulder. He has the ultimate poker face and no one knows when he might put his chips into the game.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Behind Heavy Hitters, Offense Is Soaring Up, Up and Away

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
With all due respect to Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas is the most remarkable player in baseball today. Thomas, more than Griffey, epitomizes the overall offensive developments that have dominated the first half of the season.
Home runs, both the massive total and the individual feats led by Griffey, have dominated talk in the first half of the season, but the season has featured more than just home runs, and a look at Thomas's production for the Chicago White Sox provides the most comprehensive picture. 
 The first baseman, the unanimous selection as the American League most valuable player last season, entered yesterday's games with a .380 batting average, 31 home runs and 73 runs batted in. That would be a terrific season for many players.
 
An Exceptional Season
 For Thomas, though, those numbers make him one of the players who is making this an exceptional season.
As the season reaches the All-Star break, the major leagues have an inordinate number of players hitting .350 or higher, players with 25 or more home runs and players who have driven in 70 or more runs.
Using last season and the 1987 season, the year in which a record number of home runs was hit, for comparison, 1994 has been remarkable.
Going into the final weekend before the break, seven players were hitting .350 or higher compared with four at the break last year and two in 1987. Five players had slugged 25 or more home runs compared with none last season and five in 1987, and 12 had knocked in 70 or more runs compared with four a year ago and five in 1987.
 
.330 and Beyond
 At this time last season, John Olerud and Andres Galarraga were flirting with .400, but Olerud (.395) was the only American Leaguer over .330, and Orlando Merced and John Kruk were the only National Leaguers besides Galarraga (.391) at .350 or higher. In 1987, Wade Boggs (.375) and Tony Gwynn (.370) -- who else? -- were the only players over .350.
This season's list includes Thomas, Paul O'Neill, Kenny Lofton, Albert Belle and Will Clark in the A.L. and Gwynn and Hal Morris in the N.L.
At the break a year ago, Barry Bonds and Mickey Tettleton led their respective leagues with 24 home runs each. In 1987, Mark McGwire's 33 topped a group of five players at 25 or higher. This season, Griffey and Matt Williams each has 33, Thomas 31, Jeff Bagwell 26 and Albert Belle 25.
Bonds, with 71, was the only National Leaguer with 70 or more runs batted in at the break last season while three A.L. players, including Cecil Fielder with 77, had reached that mark. In 1987, Jack Clark had a whopping 86 r.b.i. and was joined in the 70-or-over listing by two players from each league. Plagued by injuries, including a torn ankle ligament, Clark drove in only 20 runs after the break and finished with 106.
This season's 70-plus list is lengthy.
"We have two guys with 70 r.b.i.," Don Baylor, the Colorado Rockies' manager, said. "It's kind of scary to think at the All-Star break there's going be 10 or 12 guys who have a chance at the r.b.i. title."
Going into yesterday's games, Kirby Puckett, with 79, was the No. 1 man in a collection of eight A.L. players at the 70-or-higher plateau. Bagwell, also with 80, was the head man in a group of four National Leaguers.
"There are probably more runners on base," Baylor said. "Guys probably are walking more. Every time you walk someone, they seem to score."
 
Pitching Skill Declines
 At the break last year, pitchers had walked 8,031 batters. With two days of games left, pitchers had walked 8,401 this season. The decline in pitching ability -- or a shrinking strike zone -- has created more opportunities for batters to drive in runs.
A "juiced" ball, of course, does not create more walks. But the man holding the ball does. The shrinking talent pool of pitchers is a constant topic of conversation in baseball. Doug Melvin, assistant general manager of the Baltimore Orioles, cited one effect of that development.
"I think we rush young pitchers to the big leagues because of their stuff," Melvin said. "Maybe physically they have the best arms and the best ability, but they're not ready to perform in the major leagues. We bring them up too quickly and don't prepare them properly."
There is no shortcut to the majors, Melvin added. "We need to develop pitchers fully," he said. "We don't have the patience to keep them in the minors. They throw the ball 90 miles an hour and we rush them through Double A and Triple A."
But the opposite happens more often than not, and a year after expansion, when teams are still trying to fill pitching holes, they grasp at developing but unprepared youngsters like Rick Helling (Texas), Arthur Rhodes (Baltimore), Tim VanEgmond and Gar Finnvold (Boston), Salomon Torres (San Francisco), Darren Dreifort (Los Angeles) and Paul Shuey (Cleveland).
Perhaps the number of hitters with dazzling production totals grows in direct proportion to the number of ill-prepared pitchers who pitch to them.
 
No Levity in This Clubhouse
 If George Steinbrenner doesn't like the theory that his scare tactics have hurt attendance -- he keeps warning prospective customers that it's dangerous to go to Yankee Stadium -- here's another one. Although the Yankees are in first place after a 12-year absence from post-season play, they have become a dull, colorless team that has no appeal to the fans.
Gone are the days of George and Billy and Reggie. Steinbrenner doesn't even have Dave Winfield to kick around. Instead, the Yankees, under the stifling command of General Manager Gene Michael and Manager Buck Showalter, are permitted to say nothing or do nothing that might attract attention.
Luis Polonia, a wonderfully free-spirited personality who can inject humor into the serious game of baseball, learned last week what happens when a player goes beyond the line of propriety as drawn by the manager.
Polonia made some humorous remarks about the parade of pitchers staged by the Oakland Athletics, and he became the unnamed object lesson of a Showalter lecture to his team.
Individual players and personalities attract fans. But on this Yankee team, there can be no individuals, certainly none with a personality.
 
Pitcher Up! Batter Down!
 Tony La Russa, the Athletics' manager, does seem to be outdoing even himself with his use of relief pitchers. After using three pitchers to face three batters and get three outs in a game against the Yanks, he used eight pitchers in a game against Baltimore, including four who faced one batter each, three of them in one inning.
But as the general manager of another club said: "It's working. They're all no-names. By the time he brings them in, the players ask who are they and try to find out what they throw, they get them out."
The strategy has become contagious. Marcel Lachemann, the California manager, used three pitchers to get three outs against the Yankees Friday night. Platoon pitching has become as much a part of the game as platoon hitting.
 
What the Poll Left Out
 The commissioner's office commissioned a poll that featured questions tantamount to "when did you stop cheating on your wife?" The Gallup survey asked baseball fans if they thought player salaries were too high and if they favored a salary cap. Yes and yes, an overwhelming number responded, 72 percent for the former and 76 percent for the latter.
The answers came as no surprise, but other questions come to mind:
Why didn't Gallup ask if the fans thought the owners should have a cap on their profits?
If baseball's economy is so bad, why are the owners wasting money on something so meaningless and frivolous?
If the owners were sharing their revenue with the players this year, would the players have paid for 50 percent of the poll?
 
Hats Off to Piniella
 Lou Piniella has not been a happy manager this season because the Seattle Mariners have not played up to his expectations. His frustration emerged recently when he tossed his cap, second base and his gum onto the outfield grass. His action prompted Piniella to recall a similar incident when he managed the Yankees and disclosed that not all of his vehement arguments are spontaneous.
"George called me one day," Piniella related, "and said, 'I hired you to put on a show. Now get thrown out and put on a good show.' "
Picking his spot, Piniella walked toward the umpire and, along the way, carefully dropped his cap in the on-deck circle. The cap, he explained, was to be part of his finale. "I was going to kick the hat into the stands and the people would fight for it," he said.
"So I'm kicking the dirt -- it was real loose dirt," he recalled, "and I'm waving my arms and now it was time for the finale. I go for the hat, but when I get there, I find that the batboy had picked it up. 'Here's your hat, Mr. Piniella,' he said. I said, 'Put my prop down.' "

HEADLINE: Electricity Industry Needs Competition

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Electricity Shopping Can Be a Bad Deal" (Viewpoints, June 12), Ralph Cavanagh bases his argument against deregulation of the electricity industry on his erroneous assertion that electricity production "has a greater effect on the environment than any other economic activity." Like many environmentalists, Mr. Cavanagh prefers to find fault with utility companies rather than tell us that the transportation sector -- especially the cars we drive -- is the primary source of pollution in this country. Perhaps he has not read the current New York State Energy Plan, which found that 80 percent of toxic air emissions in this state come from the transportation sector. Until environmentalists focus their efforts on the transportation sector, we will have neither a cleaner environment nor the beneficial lower prices that deregulation of the electricity industry would produce.

How a Wide Variety of Nails Holds Things Together

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE 

 BODY:
SELECTING nails is challenging, even for professionals. One reason is the wide variety of building materials, as nearly all need nails with specific holding properties.
For an idea of how different nails function, consider their three parts, the point; the shank, or shaft, and the head. Nails with long sharp points wedge fibers apart and are easier to drive than nails with blunt points, which simply punch through wood. But sharper nails are more likely to cause splitting. 
 For that reason most nails for general use have diamond-shaped points, which combine elements of both kinds. Even so, carpenters often deliberately blunt the points of general-purpose nails to insure further against splitting. They do that before driving the nails near the ends of boards or into brittle wood.
A nail's grip, or resistance to withdrawal, is produced by the friction of wood fibers against the shank. The larger a shank's surface area, whether owing to its diameter or length, the greater the nail's holding power.
As a rule the correct length of a nail is three times the thickness of the piece through which it is driven. If the piece is very thin, as with asphalt shingles or hardboard paneling, the nail should enter the second piece, the one to which the first is fastened, by at least three-quarters of an inch. Engineers often rely on a different formula, namely that nails should enter the second piece by a distance equaling 12 times the nail's diameter.
Where a nail chosen by either rule would penetrate the second piece completely, as when nailing together two pieces of equal thickness, two or more nails, each somewhat shorter than the combined thickness of both pieces, are usually sufficient. Longer nails have to be used when fastening materials having little holding ability.
The nail head serves mostly to resist "pull-through," should the joined pieces be pressed away from the direction of the nail's point. Where appearance is important, nails may have small heads designed to be driven beneath the surface. But such nails have little resistance to being pulled through and should be used just where stresses are quite unlikely to occur.
Coatings, threads and rings found on some nails enhance their grips, in different ways. Cement-coated nails, dipped in a resinous adhesive that softens from friction when the nail is driven, initially bond tightly to wood, but lose strength after a few months. Carpenters use those nails primarily so that their work will withstand the rigors of house construction. By the time the adhesive weakens, the joints are reinforced by additional building materials.
Galvanized coatings, designed to prevent steel nails from rusting, also enhance grip by increasing surface area and roughness. Although using galvanized nails solely for their increased grip is seldom economical -- they usually cost more than cement-coated nails -- an advantage is that they do not lose their holding strength.
Threaded and ringed nails grip more strongly than coated or galvanized nails. When driven, both wedge apart wood fibers, which then spring back and lock into the spaces between the threads or rings. Unlike plain-shank nails -- coated or bright (smooth) -- threaded and ringed nails grip tightly even when the surrounding wood becomes wet or shrinks.
Threaded nails resist withdrawal even while being pulled or forced out. That makes them excellent for flooring, which often flexes. Sized correctly, the plain part of the shank above the threads should equal or exceed the thickness of the material that will contain it, assuring that the pieces will be drawn tightly together.
Ringed nails grip more strongly than threaded nails, but any force sufficient to draw or thrust them out breaks the fibers surrounding the shank. Such nails, if they loosen, do so suddenly and permanently.
Although many nails are still formally classified by penny size -- a number followed by the abbreviation "d" -- specifying nails by length is perfectly acceptable, even at the testiest of stores.
As length increases, so does diameter and head size. The length of nails whose heads are designed for sinking below the surface includes the thickness of the head. Other nails do not. Here is a guide to varieties:
Common Nails Probably the most familiar. They feature thick, flat heads, plain shanks (bright or galvanized) and have a larger diameter than others. Use for general-purpose heavy construction.
Box Nails Look like common nails, but have a smaller diameter. As a result they have less tendency to split boards when driven near their ends. Use them in thin wood and wherever boards have to be nailed close to their ends or edges.
Sinkers Cement-coated box nails. Because their coating increases their grip they are made one-eighth to a quarter-inch shorter than plain box nails having the same penny size. Sinkers have to be installed rapidly with just a few hammer blows. If you pause too long, the adhesive will harden and the nail will be difficult to drive farther.
Finishing Nails Probably the second most familiar type. They have a small nearly spherical head with a dimple in the center to accommodate a nail-set used to drive the nail below the surface. The diameters are the smallest of all conventional nails. They are plain shanked, bright or galvanized, and typically used for cabinetry, paneling and trim.
Casing Nails Resemble finishing nails, but are larger in diameter, stronger and have greater holding power. Their conical heads differ slightly from those of finishing nails, but are also meant to be concealed. Casing nails are intended for attaching window and door trim. They are also suitable for fastening large moldings like baseboard.

GRAPHIC: Diagrams: Finishing nails have semispherical heads. Casing nails are conical. Both are dimpled for nail sets.
 
Coated, threaded and ringed nails hold better than smooth shanks.
 
Length of finishing and casing nails includes thickness of head. Length of common and other flat-headed types does not. (Edward Lipinski)

HEADLINE: Mr. Kim's Death

 BODY:
Kim Il Sung's death comes at a critical moment, just days after he had personally eased mounting tensions over North Korea's nuclear program by moving to resume talks with the United States.
 President Clinton struck the right note, expressing appreciation for Mr. Kim's role in recent days and reassuring the North that he wants a continuing and "personal" dialogue with his successor after an appropriate hiatus to mark Mr. Kim's passing. A delay poses no risk, with international inspectors in place to assure that the North's nuclear freeze remains in force. 
 Washington can only hope that Mr. Kim's son and heir apparent, Kim Jong Il, or whoever winds up in power will follow in the father's footsteps and choose negotiation over confrontation.
 The legitimacy of North Korea's regime is critical to resolving the nuclear question. Founding father Kim had ruled longer than any other sitting world leader. After nearly a half-century in power, the elder Mr. Kim adopted a uniquely Korean form of succession, melding Communism with dynastic rule. He had begun to devolve day-to-day responsibilities to his son when the collapse of the Soviet empire and the Soviet Union itself called the legitimacy of Communism into question.
 North Korea remained somewhat insulated from these larger currents. Its doctrine of self-reliance made it impervious to the shifting ideological winds, even in neighboring China. And its economy relied on outsiders for only a few necessities like subsidized oil.
 But North Korea suffered grievously from the loss of its Soviet and East European trading partners. And its nuclear program made it an international outcast, only deepening economic distress.
 No succession is a sure thing and the younger Mr. Kim's impulses have worried some U.S. observers. Officials around him may be inclined to act tough: to rally domestic support they stress time-tested themes of self-reliance and the need to stand up to a hostile world, especially the U.S. With that posture, they might want the Bomb for protection.
 But the elder Mr. Kim seemed to recognize the limits of that posture and quietly resumed a larger role to assure a smooth succession. He realized that North Korea could not keep up with South Korea militarily. To try would risk economic collapse. And he knew the tough-it-out posture would give the military too much influence over a successor regime.
 He resolved to seek a peace treaty and diplomatic relations with the U.S., opening the way to security assurances and economic ties with the rest of the world. To achieve such a breakthrough, he was willing to put plutonium reprocessing on hold and allow international inspectors to verify that. Now the hope is that his successor will see the wisdom of his ways. Continued reassurance from Mr. Clinton could help.
 Hawks in Washington want to resolve the nuclear issue by destabilizing the Communist regime. But that risks a war that none of the North's neighbors want. The hawks' approach would likely revive the North's alliance with China. More important, it would risk an open breach with U.S. allies South Korea and Japan, which want both a stable and a non-nuclear Korean peninsula.
 Mr. Clinton is right to embrace those goals and reassure the new leader in the North that he wants to deal with him, not destabilize him.

HEADLINE: Most Russians Know Violence and Starvation;
How to Help

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your June 29 article on philanthropy in Russia: It is remarkable (and encouraging) that despite serious economic and political chaos, the business community has made a commitment to support charities with private contributions on a grand and growing scale. And lest we get too smug about the dubious sources of some of the private wealth that supports charity in Russia, the selfish motivation of many donors and the existence of phony charities that steal contributions, it is important to remember that these can be found in our own philanthropic sector as well. 
 It is our familiarity with these problems that has led to caution by United States funders to making grants in Russia. Most United States foundations are used to exercising a high degree of accountability over their grantees, which they cannot easily do in a country where basic tax laws, financial and accounting systems, communications and respect for the rule of law do not yet exist. Groups like Interlegal are working to change this. It will take time, and they have limited resources.
Individual donors in the United States, especially those whose families came from Russia generations ago, have shown interest in supporting Russian causes. But because United States tax law does not permit deductions for contributions to foreign charities, it is difficult for them to have much impact without using United States charities as intermediaries -- complicated and difficult under United States and Russian law.
United States churches and religious organizations are active in religious and secular projects in Russia because they have the fewest legal restrictions and greatest motivation.
The United States Government, to its credit, has been a big supporter of the nonprofit sector in Russia. Neither a government nor the for-profit sector can provide all the services and mechanisms any democratic market economy needs to function well. Government policies that promote private charitable activity are therefore quite sensible.
The Russians are coming to understand the importance of a regulatory system that permits private charitable activity to flourish while insisting on strict accountability for the use of funds. As this system grows and develops, our partnership in global philanthropy can be expected to grow as well.

HEADLINE: Christopher to Meet Hanoi Counterpart

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, July 9

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to meet with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister in Bangkok this month, senior Vietnamese officials disclosed today. The meeting would be the first between the foreign-policy chiefs of the former foes since the Communist victory in 1975.
Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai, who oversees relations with the United States, declined to confirm formally that the meeting was set. But he said in an interview, "I think there is a high possibility." 
 Mr. Christopher and the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, will be in the Thai capital to attend consultations among 18 nations on security matters after the annual foreign ministers' meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
The high-level Vietnamese-American meeting was arranged during a visit here earlier this month by Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord and Hershel Gobel, the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Their talks were part of a longstanding effort to normalize Vietnamese-American relations, which took a major step forward in February when President Clinton lifted the trade embargo that had been in force since the end of the Vietnam war.
 
Liason Offices to Open
 Mr. Mai said liaison offices -- the precursors of embassies - would be opened in Hanoi and Washington once American officials found a suitable building here.
The United States owns the building of its former consulate here in Hanoi. But Mr. Mai said "dozens of families" lived in the building now and it would take time to relocate them.
"We think there should be an interim solution," he said. United States officials here are looking for interim quarters.
The diplomat who has been named to head the American office, James H. Hall, is visiting. Now the director of the State Department's Office of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, he served as an adviser during military service in South Vietnam.
Vietnamese officials said they expected the liaison offices to open within a month or two but that they doubted Mr. Clinton would soon raise them to embassy status.
 
Americans Divided
 "The division in American society on the question of Vietnam remains deep," an official said, speaking on condition that he not be named. "It will take some time."
But he said Vietnam saw the difference between a liaison office and a full-fledged embassy largely as one of name, and that it was ready to give the top American representative here the same access to Government leaders he would have if he were an ambassador.
Mr. Mai said Mr. Lord and Mr. Gobel had come to Hanoi this month "to thank the Vietnamese people for their cooperation" in working to resolve the issue of the 2,231 Americans still listed as missing from the war in Indochina. Despite both officials expressing satisfaction with the continuing progress, leaders of American veterans organizations who accompanied them "had a different opinion."
The Deputy Minister said Vietnam had agreed to two requests made by the officials and the veterans' leaders. One was for greater unsolicited efforts by the Vietnamese, particularly in searching through the records of various ministries for clues to the fate of the missing. The Hanoi Government also agreed to appeal to its citizens to come forward with any information they might have on a missing serviceman's case.
 
Concerns Over Instability
 Mr. Mai said Vietnam was concerned about instability in Cambodia but was determined to remain "disinvolved." Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and overthrew the regime of Pol Pot, the leader of the widely feared Khmer Rouge. It withdrew its last troops in 1989.
The Deputy Foreign Minister said that the agreements reached in 1991 on a transition to peace in Cambodia had committed all major and regional powers to preserving the country's stability, and Vietnam would adhere to the "multilateral approach" even in seeking protection of the ethnic Vietnamese there. Vietnamese are widely resented in Cambodia and have fallen victim to mass killings there since last year.
The Deputy Minister said that in discussing human rights, Mr. Lord had asked for information on the well-being of four Vietnamese imprisoned for political offenses. He toldthe Americans that the four were in good health.
Ten Americans are imprisoned here, some for political offenses. A European diplomat with connections to Vietnamese officials said the authorities were nervous about possible opposition activity by former Vietnamese citizens visiting from the West.
Mr. Mai said Vietnam would recognize as foreign nationals only those emigres who had taken legal steps to divest themselves of Vietnamese citizenship.
 
The American Presence

 
 Alluding to Vietnamese concern about American interest in human-rights cases here and possible linkage to trade privileges, the Deputy Foreign Minister said he considered Mr. Clinton's decision to extend most-favored-nation status to China as "suitable to international trends."
Mr. Mai disputed a widely held view that Vietnam's eagerness for an American presence here was based on a desire to use Washington as a counterbalance to China, Vietnam's historic enemy. He said it would be bad diplomacy to play off one big power against another now that the cold war is over.
"All major powers, without exception, should be able to play an active role in Southeast Asia, and none should have a feeling of being left out," he said.
Mr. Mai said Vietnam and the United States had agreed to recognize ownership of Government assets in each others' countries and that senior legal officials would meet in Bangkok on Aug. 1-3 to work out details.

Now, after a half-century of setbacks, only a few merchants survive there. On several blocks, parking lots and boarded-up storefronts outnumber active shops. Along the west side of Ninth, from 35th to 38th, the only businesses operating are a parking lot and the Kam Hong restaurant. 
 Hoping to recapture the past, local merchants joined with Community Board 4 in December to win a rezoning for residential use, and now they are trying to enlist city and state agencies in revising a development and marketing strategy.
For aficionados of exotic foodstuffs and bargains, the remaining shops still provide a magnetic allure. Where better to find Jamaican Jerk Sauce, tropical yams, tamarind nectar, octopus, baby eels, shark, couscous, rabbit, venison, baguettes, Afghani flatbread, Turkish coffee beans, goat gouda cheese or dried Egyptian fava?
The merchants want to attract workers from midtown offices and the garment center and tourists from the theater, restaurant and hotel district and the nearby Circle Line, Intrepid Museum and Javits Convention Center. They hope to draw from transportation hubs like Penn Station, the Port Authority, Lincoln Tunnel, Times Square subways, the piers and the West Side Highway.
"We're really the western gateway to New York," said Susan Wilson, a consultant to the merchants.
 For decades, Paddy's Market served more as the city's battered back door. Tenements and factories were demolished to make way for the tunnel, rail yards, bus terminal and convention center, robbing the area of business and population. Manufacturing sank, the printing industry vanished and the garment industry shrunk. The recession hit hotels and restaurants hard, and some of them were wholesale clients on Ninth.
"Our area was decimated in years of abuse," said James Dell'Orto, owner of Manganero's Hero Boy. Even when the merchants dreamed up the Ninth Avenue food festival in the early 1970's, it became a success above 42d Street, with Paddy's Market as the straggling tail end.
 For decades the city imposed industrial zoning on the strip, which never attracted industry but did stymie loans to keep up the aging apartments above the stores. Ms. Wilson estimates that at least 600 apartments are vacant. Planners hope the new zoning, restoring residential use, will enliven the neighborhood.
Still, the vacant stores, the shadows cast by the bus terminal overpasses and the pockets of prostitutes, homeless people and squeegee wielders all make the strip uninviting, creating a barrier between Paddy's Market and Ninth's vibrant segment above 42d.
 Mr. Dell'Orto, who sold paper bags at the pushcarts as a young boy, said that the old Paddy's Market virtues of ethnic diversity, neighborhood ties, living near work and eating fresh, healthy food were in vogue again. "You know," he said, "they weren't so stupid a hundred years ago after all." BRUCE LAMBERT

A Tug-of-War Redux

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
It is a classic battle for space in a crowded city. A venerable private day school, bursting at the seams, wants to take over the recreation floor of an apartment building that houses its high school.
The building's tenants, for whom the floor has long served as a sort of town hall and community playground, become angry. They carry pickets at the school's commencement, send angry letters and enlist the help of politicians, including the Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger. 
 The dispute has been raging for a year and now Community Board 7, after months of soul searching, made a recommendation last week, deciding unanimously to oppose the plan by the 285-year-old Trinity School, unless the school offers the tenants comparable facilities.
The fate of the space now rests with the City Planning Commission, which will decide whether to allow the expansion by altering the urban renewal plan for the area, which governs how space in the building, at West 92d Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, can be used.
Trinity, which built the 29-story building and which occupies the first three floors, has said it must expand into the fourth-floor community rooms and recreation area because its 920 students are crammed into classrooms designed for only 600.
But the tenants who live above say the community space, which includes an outdoor loggia, was guaranteed to them when they moved into the building and was also part of the school's agreement with the city.
"These facilities have been very important to us," said James A. Paul, vice president of the tenants' association. "They've allowed us to have a life together as a community."
Residents have been made angrier in the dispute because the school has kept them locked out of the loggia area for more than a year while the fate of the space is being decided. School officials have said the area is padlocked because of concerns about the safety of the residents, but residents counter that they and their children have used the area for years without incident.
Gus Oliver, the president of the school's board, said the school was looking into building an equivalent community area for the tenants on the roof of the building and moving the laundry room to the basement, where some school employees now have offices. But the board's resolution opposing the plan said that the school had "failed to make any concrete proposal for roof-top space for the tenants' consideration."
Tenant leaders also say that the discussions have been hindered because school officials have been evasive about the nature of their plans from the beginning. The tenant association recently retained a lawyer, Jacqueline Bukowski, to help them with negotiations.
A meeting last week between the two sides ended with "little movement off of dead center," said James A. Paul, vice president of the tenants' association. R.K.

For Bosnians, Melting Pot Is a Myth

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
To most patrons, Steinway Cafe Billiards is a place to shoot some pool and guzzle a few beers afterward. But for one group of young men and women, it has much greater significance.
The pool hall on Steinway Street has become a gathering place for about 20 young Bosnian refugees who have been relocated in Queens by international agencies. Here, they speak Serbo-Croatian, which they now call "Bosnian," drink coffee, listen to Bosnian music on tape cassettes, gossip and giggle. When they have money, they even shoot pool. 
 "Things have been difficult," said Nadim Ridjanovic. "We don't really fit in here."
In Sarajevo, it was chic and simple "to act American, to be cool" -- listening to Bruce Springsteen and wearing sunglasses and jeans. But up close, they say, America is hard to fathom.
Their new neighborhoods, primarily in Astoria, Ridgewood and Flushing, are a hodge-podge of cultures. Salsa music blares on streets that are crowded with Chinese, Indian and Greek restaurants and Italian bakeries.
The youths see themselves as outcasts in this melting pot and among the older Bosnian immigrants and refugees, who resent them for not staying and fighting for their country. With little help from the organizations that helped bring them over and from Muslim organizations here, they are struggling to make ends meet.
To Mr. Ridjanovic and his friends, the melting pot is a myth -- at least in their case. They say ethnic prejudices run deep. Greeks in Astoria are pro-Serbian, the young men say, something that disturbs many of them who said they were tortured by Serbian soldiers during the war. Historically, Serbian and Greek Orthodox Christians shared a common hatred for the Ottoman Empire, making them de facto allies.
In a delicatessen near his home, Mr. Ridjanovic says, he hears its Greek owner wishing for a Serbian victory in the war. But Mr. Ridjanovic did get some satisfaction out of seeing Greece's defeat in the World Cup.
The young immigrants also are careful to keep their distance from clubs and bars that are known to be Croatian and Serbian turf. "We don't want to start a fight in this country," Mr. Ridjanovic said.
Many of the immigrants came from comfortable families and are well- educated. But because of language difficulties and different educational standards in America, they now have to accept unemployment or low-paying menial jobs.
Amir Deljanin, 19, was studying to be a computer technician in Sarajevo. He now works in a warehouse in Flushing.
Others have been victimized by unscrupulous employers. Mr. Ridjanovic said he spent nearly $300 responding to advertisements that promised jobs with big returns for a small investment up front. After spending $200 on photographs, he barely broke even, working two days as an extra on a movie set. He also spent money buying ice picks and other tools for a short-lived career as a door-to-door meat salesman. He now calls this country "the United Scams of America."
But the Ridjanovic family, like many Bosnian families, resisted applying for welfare.
"We don't need handouts!" declared Mr. Ridjanovic's father, Dr. Midhat Ridjanovic, a former professor of linguistics at the University of Sarajevo. "We need jobs that would pay us money. We're willing to work."
There is little emotional support for these youths from older Bosnians. On a recent Sunday, a group of middle-aged men sitting in a semicircle at the Bosnian Islamic Cultural Center stopped talking about the conflict back home when Mr. Ridjanovic appeared on the scene.
"Why are you here?" one man asked. "Why aren't you fighting for our country?"
Mr. Radjanovic quickly walked away.
Later, in the pool hall, he asked rhetorically, "Why can't he go and fight? He's still young."
Several young men chimed in, "They want us to die for them."
In the background, a tape of Dino Merlin, a Bosnian rock singer, blended with the cracking of the pool balls. "I always dream about going back to Bosnia," he sang. "Someone is waiting for me, somebody who loves me."JANE H. LII

Bugs Bunny and Friends Arrive at Queens Mall. . .

The Warner Brothers Studio Store, which created a stir when it arrived in the high-style neighborhood of 57th Street near Fifth Avenue, has opened another store in a very different setting: the Queens Center mall in Elmhurst. 
 The stores sell clothing, toys and souvenirs emblazoned with animated cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny and Tweety Bird.
Casper Caldarola, a spokeswoman for the stores, said the company had been attracted to Queens Center because "it's a high-traffic mall and there's no other entertainment store out there." In addition to the 7,900-square-foot store, she said, the company will provide "Warner theming," including a 30-foot-high Bugs Bunny.
 
. . .While 57th Street Gets Another Unlikely Store
 Next year, the Warner Brothers Studio Store on 57th Street and the nearby high-fashion outlets like Chanel, Burberry and Hermes will have a new neighbor: an Original Levi's store.
Designs, Inc., based in Chestnut Hill, Mass., has signed a long-term lease for the 15,000 square feet of space now occupied by Ann Taylor, which caters to young businesswomen, at 3 East 57th Street, between Madison and Fifth Avenues. The Original Levi's operated by Designs Inc. sell Levi Strauss & Co. products exclusively, including jeans, baseball caps and leather coats.
 
Coming to the Bronx Hub, An Alexander's Replacement
 Bradlees, the discount retail chain, is planning to set up shop in a 170,000-square-foot store to be built in the Hub, the central business district in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx.
"When Alexander's moved out two years ago we lost a lot of advertising that brought people to the neighborhood," said Bill Bollinger, director of commercial development for the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation. "Bradlees will act as our new anchor and people will come and shop up and down the streets."
Bernard Rosenshein, who has developed 50 shopping centers around the country, will put up the building, which is expected to be completed by December 1995. He successfully bid for a lease on the city-owned retail lot as part of the city's effort to revitalize retail developments in distressed neighborhoods.
Bradlees has announced plans to open its first store in the city in November in Union Square and another soon after on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, and more are in the works. "We looked at the map and realized there are 10 million people in the city and Long Island that we don't serve," said Sam Mandell, Bradlees' president. "Our bread and butter is in urban suburban settings, and that's where we are going to concentrate our growth."
 
Big European Clothing Chain Plans First New York Store
 MaxMara, a European producer of women's classic ready-to-wear clothes with a touch of high fashion, will be opening its first store in the Northeast in September at 813 Madison Avenue, at the corner of 68th street.
The company, which is based in Reggioemmilo, Italy, has 250 stores around Europe and the Far East, but only two in the United States, in Palm Beach, Fla., and San Francisco.
Donna Cristina, a spokeswoman for MaxMara, described the clothes as costlier than those at Brooks Brothers but less expensive than those at Giorgio Armani, with suits ranging from $500 to $800. The company has bought the building at Madison and 68th Street and is restoring its original limestone facade. The store will encompass 3,600 square feet and two floors.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE HEARTLAND;
A Moderate Democrat From Omaha Caught in the Middle on Health Care

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OMAHA, July 9

 BODY:
It scarcely had the feel of radical politics: church bells pealed in the distance and a soft breeze fluttered an American flag as some 40 Nebraskans, most of them elderly, sat in lawn chairs on a sultry evening, sipping lemonade and talking with Representative Peter Hoagland about health care.
 But on the sidewalk, a grimacing man in a baseball cap and T-shirt paced back and forth with a cardboard sign that declared, "Give me liberty, not socialism!" 
Long before Mr. Hoagland returned to his district for the Fourth of July recess, voters here had been deluged with television and radio advertisements that cast Democratic efforts to revamp health care as a dangerous, even sinister threat to free enterprise.
 And wherever the three-term Democratic Congressman appears these days --Omaha Optimists Club, B'nai B'rith, trade union halls -- he hears the plaintive questions of frightened constituents, often framed in the precise warnings of the advertisements sponsored by conservative groups.
 "Will I still be able to go to my own doctor?" a retired woman asked.
 "Are my taxes going to skyrocket?" a union electrician asked.
 "Am I going to lose my job?" an insurance agent asked.
 
A Vulnerable Democrat
 The advertising blitz in this district might be unmatched anywhere, largely because Mr. Hoagland, a Democrat who represents a relatively conservative district, is seen as vulnerable on the issue.
 Until his election six years ago, the Omaha district was represented by Republicans for 40 of 46 years. And in the 1992 Presidential election, George Bush outpolled Bill Clinton by 15 points. All three of Mr. Hoagland's victories have been squeakers, and he now faces a strong challenge from a candidate with support among fundamentalist Christians, a conservative who favors the teaching of creationism in public schools, opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest and has been a fierce critic of Government involvement in health care.
 "We have blanketed the Omaha market," said Brent Bahler, the spokesman for a group called Citizens for a Sound Economy, a conservative group based in Washington that has spent more than $1 million on health care advertisements. "We go duck hunting where the ducks are. And if you look at the Omaha district, you'll find that it's conservative Middle America. And after our ads ran, the phones in Congressman Hoagland's office were ringing off the hook."
 One advertisement says the consequences of all the Democratic health care plans would be ruinous: "tax increases, job losses, less money in your pocket to spend the way you want to spend it."
 
Deep Skepticism Abounds
 Groups that support changes in health care, like the A.F.L.-C.I.O., have also run advertisements here, but they have been dwarfed by those opposing the kind of changes sought by President Clinton, especially his goal of coverage for all Americans.
 Whether the advertisements are shaping public opinion, or simply reflecting it, there appears to be deep skepticism here about almost any change in health care coverage. Coupled with what appears to be a general antipathy toward President Clinton and Congress, the mood of Omaha voters illustrates the predicament facing moderate Democrats like Mr. Hoagland on the health care issue.
"A lot of people are simply uneasy about anything Congress might do," Mr. Hoagland said as he climbed into the back seat of a mini-van and headed toward another stop. "If the House can come up with a bill that I can defend here --well, that would be great."
 But he made it clear that no plan has yet met the test. He has called for the creation of consumer pools that could negotiate affordable rates on medical plans.
 
Yes and No Votes
 Mr. Hoagland has voted in favor of requiring employers to pay for health care for workers, as long as small businesses and those with high worker turnover receive tax credits. But last week he voted against a plan that would enroll Americans without health care in the Medicare system, a measure that barely cleared the Ways and Means committee.
 And in response to voters' questions about universal coverage, he said flatly: "It's just not going to happen. Politically, it's just not possible."
 To be sure, not all voters here oppose efforts to expand health coverage. Rita Carroll, a young woman who looked the picture of health and prosperity, told the Congressman: "I have multiple sclerosis. There is new medication out now, but it costs $1,100 a month. If I was on welfare, it would be paid for. But I can't pay for it. No way -- none."
 
90% Have Health Insurance
 More than 90 percent of the people in Omaha, however, have health insurance, Mr. Hoagland said. And to them, fear of crime and dissatisfaction with the welfare system appear to have a much higher priority. This is also the home of the insurance giant the Mutual of Omaha, which favors requiring employers to pay for health benefits, but has been critical of other elements of many proposals.
 Even in talks with trade union members, whose national leaders have called for extending coverage to all Americans, Mr. Hoagland was warned against making any rash moves.
 "Now, I haven't read all 800 pages of the plan, mind you," said Jim Picconi, a 55-year-old union electrician. "But our coverage right now is pretty good. And I don't want that to change."
 Mr. Hoagland, whose style blends the manner of the self-effacing Midwesterner and the polished Yale law school graduate, emphasizes repeatedly that he is no left-wing liberal, and that market-oriented solutions are the key to improving health care coverage.
 He appears eager to distance himself from President Clinton, at least on health care, while his opponent, Jon Christensen, portrays him as a liberal out of step with his district. In a poll published in mid-June by The Omaha World Herald, Mr. Christensen, a 31-year-old insurance salesman, was leading by 11 points.
The Democrat has been the target of negative advertisements before, especially during the budget debate last year, and worries that they could doom his political career.
 "One man's reputation can stand just so many of these negative ads," Mr. Hoagland told an audience at B'nai B'rith.
 But few of the Omaha voters aimed any barbs at Mr. Hoagland as sharp as those in the advertisements.
 One woman, Mary Johnson, even said that if nothing was accomplished on health care, the voters were as much to blame as the politicians.
 "I hear these sad stories about people without coverage and I feel terrible," Ms. Johnson, a first-grade teacher, said after a neighborhood gathering with Mr. Hoagland on M Street. "But then I start to think about the money coming from my own pocketbook, and I get a little greedy. I guess I'm like everyone else. I want utopia. I want everybody to be covered for everything. And I don't want any of us to have to pay for any of it."

'It Was All a Kind of Enchantment'

BYLINE: By ERIKA DUNCAN; Erika Duncan is an essayist and novelist who lives in Sag Harbor.

 BODY:
PINK and yellow. And each of the fullest intensity of their hue. As I sat on the sofa with Enez Whipple, the bright pink of her sweater was echoed by the pale pink of the tulips on the coffee table before us. Against the white walls, and the chairs and the sofas that I would remember as white, came yellow pillows and little yellow details. It was the time of the yellow outside. Through the large windows of this East Hampton house built around an old water tower, came the vista of yellows of daffodils, daisies, birds singing outside. On a table in the dining room, a distance away but connected in the wide open space, there were white china fruits, and somehow, in my memory -- although whether or not they were really there, I don't know -- I add white china flowers.
There were none of the paintings of the abstract expressionists on the expansive white walls, nor the photographs of the many trail blazers -- first showings of the photographs, for example, of the interior of the last office of Freud, nor echoes of Hans Namuth or Dorothy Norman or Arnold Genthe, the people whom Enez Whipple had repeatedly granted a safe space to show in their earlier, more volatile days, during her 40-year stint as director of East Hampton's Guild Hall. 
 Even the new glossy print book, just out, that Enez Whipple had put together to tell the story, "Guild Hall of East Hampton, An Adventure in the Arts," was absent from that friendly white and pink and yellow living room.
In the last 10 years, since Enez Whipple's retirement, Guild Hall has had four different directors, a fact not surprising considering the tensions and the complex meshings of conflicting agendas that has always marked this community, where repeatedly artists in all areas have come for the particular quality of the light. What was it about Enez Whipple that had allowed her to hold the position as coordinator of it all, creating, well before such a thing was in fashion, a home for "interrelating the arts"?
'Temple as a Museum'
"It was the original vision of a museum as a temple that you went to be educated in. You went to the theater, and during the intermission you went into the garden and saw outdoor sculpture. In the 30's, when Guild Hall was founded, only 2.9 percent of museums engaged in performing arts programs, so that by luck we were pioneers in the total art experience," she said with the modesty and simplicity that would be characteristic of her talking about her career, even as I asked her what about her had allowed her to take on that role.
Enez Whipple landed in Guild Hall more or less by accident. She came from a little upstate town about 15 miles from Syracuse, where she would eventually attend the university, a student in theater arts. There on the front porch she "did the usual things every child does, putting on little plays with the other children who felt the way I did, mostly farmer's children and children of the paper mill, undertakers' chairs and all the rest." Her mother, who had gone to Syracuse University before her, had trained to be an opera singer, but she had to give it up because of a disease of the vocal chords. Her father, a rather stormy soul, was an inventor.
Like her mother before her, her first interest was in music. She was a piano student from an early age, "although [she] didn't have what it took to be a concert pianist," she said without any particular sadness. "Still, I had a great love for it."
Ironically, in the beginning she didn't have any particular interest in the visual arts. "I just didn't think of it." But in college, her friends "all were in the school of fine arts," she said. There she was to develop the particular gift of coming to an understanding of new areas of art "purely through friendships," that was to deeply mark her subsequent career. There she continued to study the piano. "Since theater was my second love, and I didn't particularly want to teach, I started to do master's work in directing and theater arts."
 
Tie to Cultural Center
 Guild Hall opened in 1931. Enez Whipple came to East Hampton 10 years later. The era of the grand old summer colony was in its last radiance, already a bit tattered and becoming forlorn, when Enez Whipple first arrived in the Hamptons with her new husband, Whip, a cartoonist who was on Guild Hall's summer board of directors.
"When I saw the Rollins Dance Studio rehearsing a scene out of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' in the garden, drifting around the courtyard in their long dresses, I felt I had never seen anything like it, that it was all a kind of enchantment," she recalled. "It was the end of the era of the great estate, and I was very glad to have been able to experience it."
She worked informally at first, assisting her husband who was really too busy to do very much for Guild Hall, until gradually the job became hers, until gradually, after three years, she became first, summer director, and then, at first unofficially, and later officially, the year-round director as well.
As Enez recapitulates the first wonderment of that long ago rehearsal on the grass, the surprise of those long floating dresses and the fairy tale quality of it all, even now, more than 50 years later, and with her four decades-long history of involvement behind her, one feels more the quality of that first child-like fascination, rather than the sense that it is she who has actually made a mark.
 
Which Came First?
 From the time of college onward, a certain enthusiasm for the makers of art had possessed her, so that it was as if the person, the creator had always come first, and the creation, the product, only second. And yet I was struck by the sense that in the face of the outspoken objections of the ultra-conservative board, only a woman like Enez would have been quite so open to allowing herself to be "taught" by the community of abstract artists, and to taking that teaching immediately back into the community.
In an area where the making of enemies goes almost without saying, she was, by all reports, to have very few enemies -- unafraid when Edward Albee deliberately went out to shock the board of directors, during the short time when he was theater director, unafraid when, in the middle of a showing of abstract art, someone decided to intrude a realistic painting.
Was it also her strange combination of nostalgia and realism, romanticism mixed with inclusiveness and fairness, that allowed her to cook up a brew of contradictory influences no one else would have been comfortable with?
As our talks weave back and forth between nostalgia for the estate era and early Guild Hall tales, she tells me the story of Albert Herter, of the family whose estate was "made of all white gardens, where everything was white," who had a painting of himself made in full Oriental regalia, and gifted to Guild Hall, so large that after he died Guild Hall didn't know what to do with it, although every day, up until his dying day, he used to come to stare at it.
It is with a certain sadness that she tell me how his son Christian had asked that the painting "be sent back up the creek," when finally, because it was so large it could not have been taken up to storage in its frame, they gave him the choice of having it rolled up, "which surely would have ruined it," or cutting it in half so that only the upper portion of the portrait could continue to be shown. It was only years later that they learned that the painting had never even been picked up, that when it finally was retrieved, it was cut up so that its back made many, many canvases.
 
Sadness and Humor
 There is a mixture of sadness and humor in her voice as she speaks, and as she tells me the story of the dreaming Mrs. Lorenzo E. Woodhouse, who, in this era when so many had lost their fortunes in the stock market crash and were just barely hanging on, would build the opulent Guild Hall, who was to become Enez Whipple's mentor and very close friend.
"By the time I arrived," she says almost wistfully, "instead of 20 gardeners, Mrs. Woodhouse was down to two or three."
The tale of Guild Hall begins, ironically, with Mrs. Woodhouse's decision to restore the Clinton Academy, an old school building on Main Street, East Hampton, to make it into a museum for housing local antiquities. As the dream of the museum filled her, in her desire for authenticity, she thought nothing about eliminating a later added wing where people used to come to play basketball, where amateur theater and community meetings would take place. Even as the museum filled up with the elegant woodwork and old furniture that it still houses today, the community for which it was supposedly built retreated.
It was once again in an effort to reinterest and reinvolve the community that Mrs. Woodhouse decided to build Guild Hall across the way, as a place where community theater would be combined with meeting spaces and there would even be a gallery for showing local art. However, once again her love of elegance and opulence got in the way. She couldn't resist making everything as elegant as possible, so that the theater became a sparkling architectural gem, in grand Elizabethan style. The galleries were crystalline and regal and forbidding. While the Rollins Company Dancers wafted across the manicured lawns, and while the very rich conservative painters showed their floor-to-ceiling self-portraits, once again the community stayed away.
 
Anm Auspicious Start
 It was into this scene that Enez Whipple entered in 1941, when all but Mrs. Woodhouse were engaged in the war effort and Mrs. Woodhouse felt herself increasingly alone with her grand enterprises. With the fading of attention to cultural pursuits and impractical dreams, here came the girl from the village of farmers and paper mill workers who would know how to talk to the potato farmers, who would know how to persuade whoever she found in the grocery store to try to be in a play.
As one sits with Enez in the realm of the pink and the yellow, and one shares her reminiscences of what Mrs. Woodhouse's parties meant to the young woman from the country, we must picture the older Mrs. Woodhouse taking the young Enez Whipple through the sparkling theater and through gilded rooms telling the tales of why she built Guild Hall. We must try to imagine what the two women meant to each other.
"What I noticed about her most was that she never spoke about her past," Enez says, "but it was always today or tomorrow she talked about, whether she was creating a garden or a playhouse for her daughter, or Guild Hall." And indeed it is this quality of always today or tomorrow that one feels in her own emanation as well.
Freely she moves from describing the "wonderful old carriage house on the Woodhouse estate which was the laboratory theater where plays were performed in a less formal way" to explaining that "in order to try to lure people into Guild Hall we had to do things that were not what most museums did, great books discussion groups, French classes and square dancing," describing the way they would bring short plays to the military bases that dotted Long Island, the more rustic winter exhibits that were her ideas: "Life Styles 1648-1976," "The Romance of Maritime Long Island," "The Long Island Indian" and "Early East End Crafts."
She laughs as she tells me about courses she took in museum management and box office management in which she "learned that pop corn and Coca-Cola made more money than plays did," how she would have to argue with funding agencies that "couldn't quite understand why they weren't showing de Kooning in January."
 
Coming to Terms
 But even as she tells me about Edward Albee's insistence that the conservatives on the board had mounted a telephone campaign to try to discourage people from coming to one of his more provocative plays, I try to imagine her coming to terms with the economic and cultural stratification that she admits rather freely both attracted and repelled her.
For the several decades, up until the late 70's and early 80's, despite that gift for friendship that I would find so prominent in her nature, she avoided trying to be too close to the artists, photographers, theater people and dancers who performed at Guild Hall. And yet so often her stories of how she discovered a particular artist or a particular body of work would begin with the tale of a friendship.
 
'Never Offended'
 "I didn't always understand a painting or a particular musical composition," she said with the strange combination of humility and daring that would mark the interview, and that would mark her openness to all varieties of absolute purity of intent, "but nothing ever startled me. I was never offended, whether by the language used in a play, or painting that was very erotic."
It was as if she had a strange instinct for the most absolutely pure -- purity indeed seemed to be one of her favorite words. The extremes, however contradictory one might be of another, never scared her. It was as if, through a rare kind of intuition, despite her open mindedness, she knew to avoid the middles.
"I was extremely fond of James Brooks's paintings, although I didn't always know why," she told me, for example. "And I loved Ibram Lassaw's expression with all the different metals. Alfonso Ossorio I like very much as a person. I liked his early work. I was not so fond of his later work, but I thought it was important to show them."
Then she broke into a story that she said made her very sad about "one particular painter who could do anything."
"It was because he was so able to do anything, and because he tried so desperately to please the group, that he was never to amount to anything," she said.
I don't know quite why, but I asked Enez about her very first friend. It turned out that she was a little girl who happened to play the harp. "Her mother was a harpist who had been in the theater, and I remember I was absolutely fascinated by them.
"That girl, who went into the theater after high school eventually came home and married a farmer boy and had eight children. Yet she still kept all those talents."
As our talk meanders, Enez feels suddenly compelled to tell me about an experience she had as a member of the one of the first American Youth Hostels in Germany and Austria, how she had lived with the German youth who were "being trained," and how terribly frightened she was of the build up of nationalism, fanaticism and anti-Semitism.
Perhaps this too contributed to her refusal to take any sort of a fanatical stand, to her insistence upon letting all things in. There is a sense of leisure as we talk, as if, no matter which way our conversation will go, there always will be more and more and more. We talk for a while about her father's inventions, which she insists didn't influence her much, since he was such a difficult man, about how he invented something called a snap gauge for measuring infinitesimal distances and also very large distances, as well as a new kind of toilet paper, patented by Scott Tissue, so that during the war when toilet paper was scarce the family always brought great rolls of toilet paper everywhere they went. We talk of the new kind of wax coating he invented for the cardboard containers of milk cartons.
And we talk of her mother who lived until she was 98 years old, and up until the time she died still wanted to go to every concert, to every exhibition.
"She lived right there in that swivel chair, you see," Enez says pointing out the chair to me, "which she adored, so that she could see everything that was going on, who went in the front door, who went out the back door."
And even as Enez continues to speak, I see her own eyes wandering, out front, out back, but always, always taking all things in.

HEADLINE: Reappraising Strict Gun-Control Bills

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
ARMED with two proposals to strengthen existing gun-control laws, county legislators last month held an open meeting to take the public's pulse on the issue. Few lawmakers were prepared for a turnout of 1,900 citizens at the County Center here, many of whom claimed angrily that the proposed changes would jeopardize residents' constitutional rights.
"Regulate Felons, Not Us," read one of the placards carried to the meeting. "Parole Control, Not Gun Control," another said. 
 Now lawmakers say community opposition to their plan has caused them to rethink the issue.
"We're revisiting the matter," said Ernest P. Davis, chairman of the Legislation Committee of the Board of Legislators.
"Some people go off the deep end when it comes to gun control, but most are reasonable," said Mr. Davis, a Democrat from Mount Vernon. "What we need to do now is approach this sanely and rethink things."
Michael J. Spano, a Republican representing parts of Yonkers, called the proposals "too harsh and not really crime-control measures."
"It's a lot of smoke and mirrors," he said. "If we do something, let's do it with real bite. Let's attack the criminals, not the law-abiding citizens."
At issue are two county gun-control proposals that would be among the nation's most stringent. One bill would bring the county in line with New York City laws requiring residents to register rifles and shotguns as well as handguns.
Another proposal calls for gun owners to renew their permits every three years and to take a gun-training and safety course. The measure would also increase permit fees from $60 to $200 or more.
Most legislators, regardless of their position on gun-control measures, agree that higher fees are an economic necessity. They point out that Westchester pays $250,000 a year to process handgun permits and conduct background checks, but charges only about $17,000 in fees.
Most also are in favor of renewable gun licenses instead of the present system of issuing handgun licenses for life.
The County Clerk's Office reported that there were 61,000 active handgun permits in the county. To obtain such a permit, an individual now applies through the offices of the County Clerk or the county police. The application is then referred to local police departments, which conduct criminal and mental background checks, said Dee Barbato, program administrator for the County Clerk.
The local procedure for obtaining a handgun permit, which sometimes takes up to six months to complete, was in effect before the Federal Brady gun-control law -- which also requires background checks -- went into effect.
But parts of the new national law have been challenged recently. For example, in Billings, Mont., on May 21, Judge Charles C. Lovell of United States District Court ruled that the Government was overreaching its powers by ordering local police to conduct background checks. The judge said, however, that checks were not in themselves illegal, and several Montana cities are continuing them.
In Westchester, where background checks were conducted long before the national law was passed, the county is likely to continue the process, independent of future District Court decisions, said Ms. Barbato.
Many who are opposed to stricter gun control measures -- including Willard E. Doughty, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association -- say local proposals, like those put forth in Westchester, fail to address the root causes of illegal firearm ownership and gun violence. They point out that most licensed gun owners do not use their weapons for illegal acts.
Indeed, most guns used in burglaries and homicides are illegally owned -- "stolen or hot weapons" -- reports Robert M. Maccarone, Director of Criminal Justice Services for the county. And most illegal weapons, he said, are brought into Westchester from out-of-state sources, although some are acquired during burglaries and robberies.
Mr. Doughty called the County Board of Legislators' gun-control proposals "totally misdirected" and said: "They have nothing whatever to do with the problems they are trying to solve. The focus needs to be on violent crimes and drying up the sources of illegal weapons."
"The sponsors of these bills are being led down the garden path on the issue," he said, "and maybe this will help them win the next election, but the tragedy is that even with tighter controls, the violence will continue."
By contrast, advocates for tighter gun controls said the measures being proposed by the Board would go a long way toward reducing the number of gun deaths.
Gun control advocates point to F.B.I. Uniform Crime Report statistics showing that each year more than 24,000 Americans are killed with handguns in homicides, suicides and accidents. They also say that, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, 15 children, age 19 and younger, are killed with guns every day.
The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reports that there are more than 211 million firearms in the possession of private citizens in the United States, and 71 million of those are handguns.
New York State Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell, who addressed the Board at the meeting, said that while automobile deaths had fallen 30 percent over the last 20 years, gun deaths had "soared." Between 1973 and 1993, the number of Americans killed in gun-related death almost doubled to more than 38,000 a year. Mr. Koppell also said that while there was "no single cure for the gun epidemic," Westchester's proposals would at least "slow the tide" locally.
Ann Janiak, chairwoman of the Westchester County Women's Advisory Board, told the Board of Legislators during the meeting that homes with firearms and where incidents of domestic violence had occurred were more likely to become the scene of future homicides.
She also said her advisory board was worried about the National Rifle Association's recent campaign -- "Refuse to Be a Victim" -- encouraging more women to carry firearms. Ms. Janiak dismissed the campaign as a marketing ploy and said women were not being told that those guns could be taken during a struggle and used against them.
Of concern to Dorothy L. DeCintio of Scarsdale, co-founder of the newly formed Westchester Handgun Control organization, was the "unruly and impolite" tenor of exchanges between gun-control advocates and those opposed to stricter laws.
Ms. DeCintio, whose brother Representative Allard Lowenstein was killed in 1980 by a student carrying a handgun, said she aired her views against a crowd of "rude, crude people who characterized themselves as great Americans and cited their Second Amendment rights to bear arms."
"It's a good law, like Nassau's and Suffolk's," Ms. DeCintio said. "I agree that there is a problem with the illegal sale of firearms, but all of these attempts to control guns are for the good."
Amy Paulin, president of the Westchester chapter of the League of Women Voters, was also greeted with boos and catcalls when she stood up to read a statement favoring stronger gun-control measures.
"I had to yell into the microphone that I had come here for a dialogue," Ms. Paulin said. "And the crowd shouted back that you need a diaphragm, not a dialogue. I told them they should be ashamed of themselves."
The league supports the proposed resolutions asking the New York State Legislature to authorize Westchester to issue gun-control provisions, and it supports measures to limit accessibility and regulate ownership by private citizens.
Mr. Doughty said that although some people opposed to gun control measures were unruly at the meeting, most were not.
Thomas Verri, a police officer and owner of Westchester Police and Uniform Supply in Westchester, also attended the meeting. He said that "without a doubt, some people get carried away with this," but that his concern was making sure "private, law-abiding citizens should not have to pay the price for criminals who own or use guns for illegal purposes."
At the Sportsman's Den in Mahopac, the co-owner, Deborah LoPrimo, said she was worried that the laws would become so strict that the average citizen could not own a firearm and that the criminals would continue to circumvent the law, rendering individuals without guns defenseless.
In Washington, Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from the 18th Congressional District, said that gun control was an issue that had to be addressed by both local and Federal governments and that she supported the Board of Legislators' proposals. But she also said that she was worried about lax Federal licensing laws for dealers:
"There are more Federally licensed firearm dealers than gas stations in the U.S. They're selling them from the backs of their cars. It's easier to get a license to sell firearms than a driver's license."

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Howard Silverman;
A Financial Business Casts a Vote of Confidence for the Island

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG 

 BODY:
THE career of Howard Silverman, chairman of Gruntal & Company, the Wall Street brokerage house, has had a major theme -- Long Island.
Mr. Silverman has not only made Long Island his home, but also the site of three branch offices that are the fastest-growing for Gruntal. His latest endeavor is the Gruntal Financial Center in Hewlett, which is to be completed this year.
The company signed a 15-year lease on a two-story 13,500-square-foot building, double the size of its current office in Hewlett. The new office will have room for a staff of 75. Gruntal has also expanded its branches in Great Neck and Syosset. 
 "Now, we are looking at Suffolk County for further expansion," Mr. Silverman said.
Much of his faith in Long Island, he said, stems from an improved local economy, as recession-battered industries like manufacturing continue to reorganize. In short, he added, Long Islanders have shown a renewed confidence in the local and national economies, and that is translating into increased investing.
Founded in 1880, Gruntal has $2.5 billion in assets and $170 million in capital. The firm, which employs more than 2,000 people, has 35 offices in 10 states. In 1991 it was acquired by the Trygg Hansa SPP Group Inc. of Sweden, the largest insurer in Scandinavia, with $40 billion under management.
Mr. Silverman, 58, has worked for Gruntal for 34 years. He became managing partner in 1974 and chairman and chief executive in 1985, when Gruntal went public. He earned a master's in economics and finance at City College. He and his wife live in Great Neck, where they have raised three children.
Q. What is your projection for the stock market in the near future? Do you anticipate a dramatic correction or a "slow drip"?
A. We're not anticipating a dramatic correction. We think the economy is in far better shape than most people realize. We're seeing an economic recovery and a surge in corporate earnings, and all of this is coming without any substantial increase in inflation. What's more important, though, is that we're seeing the productivity of the U.S. employee increase dramatically, and that tends to increase corporate earnings and keep inflation down.
You will see fluctuations in the stock market, because of the interest-rate adjustments that are going on now. But we feel they'll end in a few months. As long as corporate earnings stay on track, and we think that they will for at least the next few years, the market is in good shape.
Q. How would you advise investors bewildered by the market's recent volatility?
A. I would tell them not to take a short-term outlook. That invariably leads to selling at the bottom and buying at the top. I'd advise taking a long-term outlook, because we feel the current economic recovery and change in business will be a longer-term phenomenon. If investors look at the long-term picture we think they'll do quite well.
I don't know of any area where you can get a higher rate of total return or more liquidity than in the equity market. The real-estate market is coming along, which is very important for Long Islanders. I think home prices on the Island will rise again. They've already risen in the city.
Q. Which investments are performing best?
A. Without naming individual companies, which I'd rather not do, I would say those that are tied to the economy will do quite well. Companies tied to consumer demand, heavy industry or resources that are used in the manufacturing cycle -- they are the best situated on a nearer-term basis.
I just read in the paper that the automobile industry is seeing a scarcity of certain models. The average car-manufacturer's inventory is down, and prices have just been increased. All of this is indicative of very good business, and it should continue to reflect itself in auto stocks.
We also think chemical companies are in good shape because of the increase in overall manufacturing.
On a longer-term basis it's the growth stocks -- those in the biotech industry, the electronics industry and software companies that we're recommending. We think they have a very bright future.
Q. Is now a good buying market?
A. I think there are many equities in the buying range now, especially since we've had the reaction in the marketplace. One should not be hesitant because prices have declined. One should become more aggressive when prices fall, not when they rise. I know it goes against human nature, but that's the way to make money.
Q. Do you anticipate another rise in interest rates?
A. Interest rates have risen dramatically with the 30-year Treasury, now yielding more than 7 percent. But I think they're very close to their high, and I would advise investors not to wait to place income-oriented investments. We think now is a good time for that.
Q. Will CD's have a revival?
A. The problem with CD's is that they're yielding far lower than other income instruments. You can't buy a five-year CD that is yielding anywhere near a five-year Treasury, for example. But there's no doubt in my mind that CD rates will come up to meet the yield of the other instruments.
One thing investors should consider are municipal issues, because their yields are quite high. If, for example, Long Island residents purchase New York municipals, they are triple tax free. Their yields are above the normal relationship between municipals and other income investments. So the time for municipal investing is right about now.
Q. Should investors pull their money out of bonds?
A. No, I would not pull money out of bonds at this level. If anything, I'd be inclined to place additional money into fixed income. The rates are stabilizing, and I think they are good rates right now.
Q. What do you feel constitutes a balanced portfolio, and are mutual funds a good way for the average investor to diversify?
A. Mutual funds are good for the average person, because I think the average person needs direction. A portion of the average growth should be managed professionally, and that's essentially what mutual funds are, professional management of money. They've also performed quite well over the years.
On balance I feel at least half of an investor's investable assets should be placed into equities or equity mutual funds, with the remainder in fixed-income or income-producing institutions.
Q. Why should such a large part of assets be in common stocks?
A. Over a period of time stocks have substantially outperformed all other investment media. And there is no reason to believe that that will change in the future.
In addition, securities are liquid. If a person's financial situation should change, he can convert the equities into cash assets. If you invest in real estate or art, for example, you won't have that kind of liquidity.
Q. Is there reason to worry about the brokerage industry in view of the recent problems at Kidder Peabody and Prudential?
A. The problems at these other firms are significant. But 95 percent of this industry has never had trouble like that. I believe that those were isolated incidents, and they should in no way taint the whole industry.
At the same time, though, I think the problems those firms have had are being corrected. They are still two very fine firms. And most large brokerage houses have insurance, so their clients are protected and not placed in jeopardy.
Q. What are your feelings about foreign investments through single-country funds?
A. Some areas of the world are growing faster than others. But I think investments in a number of single-country funds are very valid. Most of these countries are not as economically developed as the U.S., Great Britain or France, for example, and there is a higher degree of risk exposure when you invest in them. Nevertheless, as we look into the 21st century, we know that Mexico will have a substantial growth rate. Some of the Eastern Bloc nations, which were recently separated from their mother country, will have great growth potential. It's important to invest in these countries. But you need professional management. You can't do it yourself. It's too risky. With a single-country fund the risk is spread out among various issues, and you have people in that country directing that investment.
Q. Is there a way for Long Islanders to invest in Long Island?
A. If you want to play certain stocks or certain areas, you should look at some of the superstores that have opened here. One only need look at Old Country Road in Carle Place to see the volume of stores that are coming in. One should also look at the plant expansions.
Unfortunately, when people think of Long Island industry they think of Grumman and how many people they've had to lay off. People think Grumman symbolizes Long Island. But that's not true. There are many vibrant industries here, and many on the way.

HEADLINE: How to Look Like a Million When You're Not

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS; Deborah L. Jacobs, an independent journalist based in New York, specializes in legal and business topics.

 BODY:
WHEN Deborah Watring started a business in her bedroom eight years ago, she wanted the giant telecommunications companies to whom she offered marketing advice to think she was running a much larger enterprise. Although pinched for money, she spent several thousand dollars on a "high-end image package" that included three-color professionally designed stationery and business cards printed on expensive paper.
Today her company, Watring & Associates, rings up $1.5 million in annual sales doing business for the likes of Nynex, MCI and AT&T. Ms. Watring credits her success in part to the big-company attributes that her business has adopted -- despite its structure as a small "virtual" corporation. Ms. Wat ring's "associates," it turns out, are 40 sole proprietors and small companies, most operating from home offices, spread over eight states. 
 To keep up the corporate image, Ms. Wat ring requires her associates to follow certain protocols. They must answer all telephone calls by stating their names or the company name; they must not let children pick up the phone, and they must never mention that they are doing the laundry. Watring & Associates has only two employees (an office manager and a part-time bookkeeper), but "we think like we're in a marble-atrium office building," Ms. Watring said.
Like many others working in small businesses, Ms. Watring faced a marketing hurdle: building credibility in an environment dominated by name brands and by a belief that bigger means better. To overcome that hurdle, small businesses are increasingly relying on ways -- some high-tech, most commonsensical -- to project larger images.
Some use business names that connote bigness (with terms like "associates" or "group") and titles ("president" or "chief executive officer") that make lone eagles sound as if they have company. Other tricks of the trade: large ads in the Yellow Pages, "800" phone numbers and addresses with "suite" numbers (which often turn out to be the president's apartment or mailbox).
The business needs of emerging enterprises have given a boost to other companies that serve them. Mail Boxes Etc., a franchise, supplies a mailroom of sorts for some of the newly created "suites." HQ Business Centers, another franchise, offers office space, conference rooms, reception areas and secretarial services.
Approximately one-third of HQ's 10,000 customers buy a "business identity" package that includes up to 32 hours a month of office space and support services, said Lisa Surman, director of marketing at the San Francisco-based company. Prices for the package range from $100 a month at a business center in San Francisco's airport to $325 a month at a choice New York address.
THE wave of corporate layoffs and downsizings in recent years has sent more people into self-employment and increased the demand for image-building services. Clients "don't want to feel they're writing a check to just some guy working out of his home," said Barry E. Maher, a consultant who advises businesses about advertising in the Yellow Pages and who works out of a bedroom in his Santa Barbara, Calif., apartment. Although he types most of his own correspondence, Mr. Maher includes the code "Bem:im" at the bottom of letters to make customers think he has a secretary. The first three letters are his initials. The second two are short for "IBM," his computer.
In a similar spirit, an exterminator's business card gives an office address in White Plains and lists "direct lines" in six other Westchester towns. In fact, the exterminator has just one office with all of the telephone numbers feeding into it.
For a number of years, Watring & Associates operated out of a mobile home next to Ms. Watring's house in Talladega, Ala. Its "associates" -- including a video production company, two graphics design firms, market researchers and technical writers -- communicated by phone and through an electronic mail system based in the mobile home.
This year, the company bought a 2,000-square-foot building in Decatur, Ga., an Atlanta suburb, to serve as an office for the two employees, E-mail system and files. But most of the associates -- along with Ms. Watring, who now lives two miles from the Decatur office -- will continue working from home. Much of the time Ms. Watring is on the road, keeping in touch by cellular phone.
Other new and increasingly affordable technologies are supplying a variety of high-tech tools for looking big. One such device is the Image Vox, an electronic secretary that is reminiscent of talking dolls. Phrases in its digitally recorded repertory include "Who's calling?" "Will he know what it's about?" and "Please hold."
The Image Vox is designed for people who are ready to talk with customers "but don't want to answer the phone themselves because they feel it reflects negatively on their professional image," said George Ferrara, the Scottsdale, Ariz., entrepreneur who invented the device. Instead, business owners can carry on the "secretary's" end of the conversation by pressing a series of buttons that engage the caller in conversation, said Mr. Ferrara, the "marketing director" of his company, Image Vox Communications. (The company has an automated demonstration line: 602 502-1718.)
What if the business owner becomes flustered or runs out of possible prerecorded responses (for instance with a chatty caller)? In that case, the person can push a general purpose "panic button." It triggers the hurried answer, "hold on just a second," as if the "secretary" needed to answer another call. The owner can then pick up, said Mr. Ferrara, who has offered the device ($300 to $450, depending on the number of custom-recorded phrases) for more than a year. He declined to say how many he has sold.
Home Automation Laboratories, a catalogue company based in Atlanta, sells other high-tech tools for looking big. These include Zany Phone Effects ($39), which makes sounds like an intercom, a ringing phone and a doorbell while the user is on the telephone, and Voice Manager (about $3,000), which can direct telephone calls to various voice mail boxes -- even if it is the same person who will get the message. Then there is Voice Changer ($89), which can alter a person's voice by 10 pitches up or down and "fool the other person into thinking there are more people there," said Barclay Brown, Home Automation's president.
For handling weekend phone calls in his own office, Mr. Brown favors a more low-tech approach. "Security," he says, impersonating a watchman as he answers the phone. Unless he knows callers, Mr. Brown asks them to call back during business hours.
Where do legitimate business purposes end and deceptions begin? Business consultants are reluctant to draw sharp distinctions. The larger that small offices and home offices look, "the more they are perceived to have credibility and the more business they are going to get," said Gene Fairbrother, who provides advice to those who call a telephone "hotline" (800 232-6273) operated by the National Association for the Self-Employed in Hurst, Tex. After getting a foot in the door, it's up to business owners to prove they are "just as capable as anyone else," he said.
One risk is that small businesses will sell products or services that they don't have the expertise or resources to deliver. In that case, they should seek out experts or subcontract for additional help, consultants say. When small businesses fail to follow through -- or worse yet, perpetuate a scam -- "it goes down as a black mark against all of us," said Sarah Edwards, a self-employment expert in Santa Monica, Calif., and co-author with her husband, Paul, of "Making It On Your Own" (G. P. Putnam's Sons) and other books.
Strategies that mislead the public can backfire, Ms. Edwards added. For instance, a sole proprietor who always uses the term "and associates" or speaks of business decisions using the editorial "we" could be embarrassed when a customer finds out that the business is a one-person operation.
On the other hand, she said, old stigmas against home-based businesses make it "counterproductive" to routinely disclose all the details. Nor is it usually relevant that a business is home-based. "Most of the services that people provide at home are not location-dependent," Ms. Edwards said.
ONCE they build credibility, small businesses can use size as a selling point, said Marilyn Ross, co-author with her husband, Tom, of "Big Ideas for Small Service Businesses," published by Communication Creativity, their Buena Vista, Colo., company. A small company "can react much more quickly than a large corporation that has to go through committees or layers of bureaucracy," she said.
Big businesses that rely on small companies and home offices seem to agree. As long as a business can "get the job done," size doesn't matter, said Peter E. Fernald, marketing manager at Northern Telecom Inc., a client of Watring & Associates. Steelcase Inc., a Grand Rapids, Mich., manufacturer of office furniture, recently named a small business that produces acoustical material for office cubicles as its supplier of the year.
The irony is that "you have to come across looking like a big company to get your clients, but keep your clients based on small-company values and services," said Karen Westerfield, whose tiny Omaha company, Wessan Interactive, offers computerized processing of "800" phone numbers. Many of Wessan's competitors are long-distance carriers like Sprint and AT&T, which can undercut the small company's prices. Ms. Westerfield, whose clients include Fortune 500 companies, emphasizes the higher level of service that she says she can offer.
Even as small businesses try to look bigger, big businesses are imitating some of their intimate touches.
Take handwritten notes of the variety that many insurance agents and stockbrokers now send. Several years ago, a small business would never send a handwritten letter for fear of looking "like a little guy," said Mr. Maher, the Yellow Pages consultant. "But now the big guys are doing it to show how they can give personal service."

HEADLINE: Dodge Foundation: Financing Initiatives

BYLINE: By GENE NEWMAN 

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN

 BODY:
AS government and corporate subsidies shrink in recession times, philanthropic organizations like the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation are sometimes the only hope for those seeking to finance projects.
Created in 1974 with a $60 million bequest from Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge, who died in 1973, the foundation occupies offices here, close to the Madison site of the former Giralda Farms estate of Mrs. Dodge, a niece of John D. Rockefeller. Assets have grown to $190 million while grants totaling $103 million have been invested in a wide variety of carefully investigated projects. 
 "Sometimes we take a problem and we find who can provide the leadership to solve it; then we get behind that person and help supply energy and focus," said Scott McVay, the executive director of the foundation since it began operations.
He said initiatives like a 10-year, $2.7 million project to teach Mandarin Chinese in 60 high schools across the country were created because of needs perceived by the foundation.
Speaking of the 20,000 students who have participated in the program, Mr. McVay said, "Those children who have learned the Chinese language and culture are the ones who will be shaping the nature of our relationship with China in the next century in business, education, diplomacy and the professions."
 
$11 Million Grant Budget
 The foundation's $11 million grant budget for 1994 ranks it in the top 1,000 of the approximately 34,000 foundations in the nation, according to the Foundation Center in New York, a clearinghouse for industry data.
Dodge program officers consider proposals from organizations meeting certain Internal Revenue Service guidelines, but, except for some of its initiatives, the foundation does not deal with individuals. Mr. McVay that only about 250 of the 2,500 applicant proposals received each year resulted in grant awards.
The three grant categories suggested in the will of Mrs. Dodge were: animal welfare, which had been one of her major pursuits; the arts and local projects in Morris County. To these, the nine-member board has added public issues and pre-collegiate education categories.
The high demand for foundation funds is shown by requests for public-issue program financing last year that totaled $12 million.
"We had a budget in that category of only $3.2 million," Mr. McVay said. "It was agonizing. There was a lot of hard work and careful screening. Eventually we came to a decision, and 35 organizations that we supported in the recent past were not funded last year."
This year, he said, with an educational budget of $3.5 million, the foundation has received proposals totaling $6 million. Sixty-two educational applications representing $4.8 million in grants have survived initial reviews and await a final arduous screening by a trustee committee.
"This represents a lot of work," Mr. McVay said. "I could spend an hour discussing any one of these 62 proposals. We really want to work with people who are trying to make things better and who operate in a selfless manner."
The foundation has searched New Jersey for what he called "master teachers" to support educational programs. He described these educators as having a zest for life and a boundless curiosity and as exemplars of good practice.
 
Project for Principals
 Elaine Pace, principal of the Littleton Elementary School in Parsippany, was 1 of 25 New Jersey principals selected for a new program in 1992. She was given a $5,000 grant to divide between a course at the Harvard University Principals' Center and a program of her choice at her school.
"That was a terrific support project for us," Mrs. Pace said. "No one had looked to principals before when they wanted to help schools."
The Parents Learning Night, which she began then, has continued every year, she said, and the principals have formed a self-help network. The foundation helped establish a Principals Center last November at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in Princeton, she said.
The Partnership for New Jersey, a community service organization of business leaders, has received public-issues grants to support a yearly leadership course for 50 young executives.
"We're in the eighth or ninth cycle now," Mr. McVay said. "The graduates of this program have formed an actively responsive network, and 15 of the alumni are in Governor Whitman's administration, some at cabinet level."
The foundation has given about 21 percent of its total grants to the arts, about three times the national average, Mr. McVay said. Recipients in 1992, the latest year of record, included giants like the Metropolitan Opera, Carnegie Hall and the New Jersey Symphony and smaller local groups like the Playwrights Theater in Madison.
In some programs the foundation has brought schoolteachers and the art world together. The Dodge Poetry Festival, held every other year since 1986 at Waterloo Village, attracts major poets from around the world like Octavio Paz of Mexico, a Nobel laureate.
 
Search for Poetic Talent
 An outspoken lover of poetry, who will recite a Shakespeare sonnet to illustrate a point and who has included verse in the margins of the foundation's annual reports, Mr. McVay spoke enthusiastically about a 1986 search for poetic talent in the state.
"We sent letters to every high school English teacher and asked eight questions on poetry," he said. "From all the responses we picked 20 and invited them to spend a Saturday at my home in Princeton explaining what they thought could be done to advance poetry."
Each teacher was asked to recite a favorite poem, and Mr. McVay said that "after an hour of listening I felt like I was in a balloon rising."
An initiative program in nonverbal arts brought in 120 applications from art teachers to receive $5,000 grants to pursue projects of their choice. "The energy, the imagination, the articulation of those proposals," Mr. McVay said, prompted the trustees to increase the number of grantees to 18 from 16.
A statewide competition among art teachers will culminate next fall in a juried exhibition at the Morris Museum with judging by a panel of renowned artists including the sculptor George Segal.
 
Improving Animal Welfare
 As for animal welfare, one of the first steps necessary to improve it is to change the attitudes of many humans, Mr. McVay said. "It's a staggering fact that 15 million to 16 million cats and dogs are put to death every year," he said. "Why? Part of the answer is that we're a consumer-oriented society of fewer and fewer long-term commitments."
The foundation supports groups across the country that actively oppose cruelty to animals and promote animal population control. Speaking of a grantee, Esther Mechler, project director of SPAY/USA, a Connecticut-based organization, Mr. McVay said: "There was something about Esther that was really worth betting on. She's become one of a dozen key leaders in humane efforts in the country."
Without a Dodge Foundation grant, the Southeast Morris chapter of the Red Cross in Madison would have no newsletter to inform the community of 60,000 that it serves, said Anne Babcock, executive director of the chapter. The newsletter advises on available services and has been instrumental in recruiting 700 volunteer workers. In today's economy, she said, "there's no other place to get this money; absolutely not."
Dodge Foundation grant recipients are required to file accountability reports after nine months. Evidence of effective use is necessary to make their next application competitive, but Mr. McVay said repeat grants should not be counted on. "We try to provide clear signals at every step along the way to lower expectations," he said.

HEADLINE: PRESSURE BY SERB ON ALLY IN BOSNIA

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, July 10

 BODY:
Maneuvering to bring an end to trade sanctions against his country, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has opened a campaign to discredit his erstwhile ally, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic.
The apparent aim is to force Dr. Karadzic to accept a settlement of the Bosnian war proposed last week by major powers including the United States. That would in turn lead the United Nations to ease the crippling trade embargo imposed two years ago against Yugoslavia to punish Serbia, its dominant republic, for its military support of the Bosnian Serbs. 
 In the last few weeks, Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia has abruptly posed a direct challenge to Dr. Karadzic by opening branches in Serbian-controlled cities in Bosnia including Banja Luka and Pale.
The new offices carry photographs of Mr. Milosevic but none of Dr. Karadzic, whose Serbian Democratic Party had virtually monopolized the political scene in Serbian-held areas of Bosnia.
At the same time, Dr. Karadzic has disappeared from state-controlled television in Belgrade, the single most powerful vehicle of Mr. Milosevic's authority and long a trumpeter of Dr. Karadzic's accounts of the military victories of the Bosnian Serbs.
"I don't know how long Karadzic will endure," said Milorad Ekmecic, a Serbian historian who used to teach at Sarajevo University. "It seems that Milosevic now wants him out."
Aside from seeking an end to the trade sanctions, Mr. Milosevic seems to be trying to distance himself from Serbian war crimes committed in Bosnia early in the war by directing blame at others.
 
Gesture of Contempt
 When Dr. Karadzic returned to Belgrade on Wednesday from Geneva, where the United States, Russia and the European Union gave him and the Muslim-led Bosnian Government until July 19 to decide on a proposed settlement, his news conference was not televised and Mr. Milosevic declined to receive him.
The proposed settlement, ringingly endorsed today by the Group of Seven industrialized democracies and Russia at a summit meeting in Naples, offers 51 percent of Bosnia to a federation of Muslims and Croats there and 49 percent to the Serbs.
Although Dr. Karadzic has publicly described the map as a humiliation to the Serbs, who now hold 70 percent of Bosnia, most analysts here predict that he will sign the settlement.
Rather than report Dr. Karadzic's views on the proposal when he returned to Belgrade, state television and other media organizations close to Mr. Milosevic moved into high gear, depicting Dr. Karadzic's self-styled government as a venal and oligarchic regime bent on thievery and warmongering.
Dr. Karadzic's notorious gambling, his purchase of villas for his family in Belgrade and the theft by Bosnian Serbs of thousands of Volkswagen Golfs from a factory near Sarajevo have all become news, though they were once taboo subjects for most of the Serbian media.
Hadzi-Dragan Antic, the director of Politika, a newspaper close to Mr. Milosevic, scathingly criticized Dr. Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb politicians in an article last week.
 
War Profiteering Charged
 "There are those who wish to continue the war at any cost," he wrote, "because, among other things, it is their only opportunity to continue getting rich and living by war profiteering or maybe in order to cover up war crimes that might land them in court."
As those reports appeared, Mico Stanisic, an interior minister of the self-styled Serbian republic in Bosnia, accused the Bosnian Serbs' prime minister, Vladimir Lukic, of embezzling 3.5 million German marks, or about $2.3 million. Mr. Stanisic is known to be close to Mr. Milosevic, while Mr. Lukic is one of the politicians closest to Dr. Karadzic.
"The message seems clear," one Western diplomat said. "Milosevic now wants peace and sanctions lifted, and he wants Karadzic as a fall guy for what the Serbs did in Bosnia."
Even though most analysts here expect that Dr. Karadzic will sign the settlement, it is not yet clear that Mr. Milosevic will get his way. Important forces in Serbia -- including the Serbian Radical Party of Vojislav Seslj and the Orthodox Church -- have encouraged Dr. Karadzic to resist.
And since the settlement would require the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from several important Bosnian cities, including Doboj and Jajce, Dr. Karadzic is likely to face strong resistance from his military leader, Gen. Ratko Mladic, and from local commanders.
Dr. Karadzic has said the latest proposal will be submitted to his self-styled parliament for a vote. In May 1993, the representatives of the Bosnian Serbs threw out an earlier plan prepared by Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen despite Mr. Milosevic's exhortation to accept it.
In that instance, the Serbian President's stand proved substantially hollow. Mr. Milosevic quickly resumed the active logistical and financial support that is essential to the Bosnian Serbs. Even now, analysts say it may be politically impossible for him to abandon his fellow Serbs in Bosnia if they reject the latest plan.
But there is an important difference today. A year ago, Dr. Karadzic had the strong support of the Bosnian Serbs. But their support is waning as they weary of war and progressive impoverishment. Mr. Milosevic, a deft politician, knows that this time he has a receptive audience.

HEADLINE: The Uninsured: Who Are They? A special report.;
Frayed Nerves of People Without Health Coverage

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

 BODY:
At the age of 52, unemployed after an international career as a manager, Bob Hughes is astonished to find himself without health insurance and wishes Washington would do something about it.
"I don't want a dole from the Government," said Mr. Hughes, who lives with his wife next to a golf course near Houston and cannot afford the $568 monthly premiums they were quoted this year. "Just a little help, a little protection until I get re-employed." 
 Mark Elias, a 36-year-old self-employed woodworker in New Orleans, has plenty of business, but he and his wife think they would rather spend their money on private schools for their three children than on health insurance. Mr. Elias, who makes custom doors and windows to the sonorous voice of Rush Limbaugh, would rather live with risk than see the Government meddle with health care.
Lauren Bright, a 26-year-old actress, survives in New York City by waiting on tables. "I'm honestly thinking of giving up acting in search of a career with benefits," she said. "It's a sad thing."
In San Francisco, Trinidad Estrada, a 29-year-old mother of three who stands in a restaurant all day making burritos, wonders how she will come up with $1,000 for foot surgery; she resents the free coverage the state gives to people she regards as loafers.
These are some of the 39 million uninsured people, more than one in seven Americans, at the center of an epic political battle as Congress decides how far the country will go toward universal coverage. Their plight has been called a crisis and a non-crisis, their numbers called understated and overblown.
Whatever the politics, evidence points unequivocally to serious hardships for tens of millions of Americans. But this problem cannot be swept away, it is clear, without costly Government subsidies or painful mandates on employers and possibly both -- a predicament that goes a long way toward explaining the pitched combat that will resume this week in Congress.
"All the studies are finding the same numbers," said Drew E. Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park, Calif. "The argument over the size and shape and seriousness of the problem is really a smokescreen for the more legitimate debate over how to solve it."

 The burdens fall largely on working families with low-to-moderate incomes. In half of uninsured households, a person works full time and in another third of households a person works part time or part of the year, according to Federal data analyzed by the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
Many uninsured people work for small businesses offering no benefits, or in low-wage or contract jobs. A vast majority believe they simply cannot afford to pay hundreds of dollars a month in insurance premiums.
The uninsured do not include the group that would otherwise be most vulnerable, the elderly. Since the creation of Medicare in the looser fiscal climate of the 1960's, everyone 65 and over has basic coverage that is largely paid for by the public.
The uninsured also do not include many of the poorest Americans, who are often covered by Medicaid, the Federal-state program. Yet, fewer than half of Americans who live below the official poverty line -- an annual income of around $15,000 for a family of four this year -- are on Medicaid, leaving millions uncovered who live in stifling need.
Minority members with lower-than-average incomes are disproportionately uninsured. While 14 percent of white Americans under 65 were uncovered in 1992, 23 percent of blacks under 65 and 35 percent of Hispanic Americans under 65 were.
Disparities among the states are also striking. In much of the South and the West, where jobs without benefits are more common and Medicaid is often less generous, more than one in five people under 65 are uninsured. In many Northern and Midwestern states it is closer to 1 in 10.
People who are excluded by insurers because of pre-existing medical conditions -- a history of cancer or a chronic disease -- have provided heart-rending stories in the health care debate. Banning such exclusions is a goal of many bills in Congress. Yet, these account for only a small fraction of the uninsured, perhaps one million of them, studies suggest.
The commonly quoted figure of 39 million or so uninsured is a snapshot of the population at any point and includes a changing mix of people. Over the course of a year, 58 million people are uncovered at least temporarily, research shows, but many regain coverage when a family member finds a new job with benefits, just as Mr. Hughes in Texas hopes to do.
This turnover has been seized on by both sides in the health care debate. Seeking broad support from the middle class, the White House stresses how widely shared the insecurity is, noting that one in every four currently insured Americans will spend vulnerable months at some point over the next two years. Opponents, asserting that relatively small numbers are chronically uncovered, say the whole problem has been exaggerated.
 
Going Without Care
 But a closer reading of the statistics shows that despite the turnover, the long-term uninsured remain numerous. A new analysis by Timothy D. McBride, an economist at the University of Missouri, finds that three-fourths of those who are uninsured on a given day, or about 29 million people, remain uncovered for one year or more and more than half of them, or 21 million people, for at least two years.
Beyond anxiety, being uninsured takes a medical toll. Most people find ways to get care when it is vital, either paying out of pocket or finding charity care. But they tend to seek help less often and late.
"All the studies show that the uninsured get less care and end up sicker than people with insurance," Mr. Altman of the Kaiser Foundation said. "Insurance per se makes a huge difference."
Many younger, healthy people voluntarily forgo the expense of insurance. In a survey last year of 2,000 adults, conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for the Commonwealth Fund and the Kaiser Foundation, 7 percent of those who lacked insurance said they did not want it, though the reasons were not specified.
Owners of restaurants and other small businesses who have offered to help pay for premiums note that some employees choose to be uncovered rather than pay their share. But it is not clear whether this is more a reflection of lack of interest or the financial strains on many workers.
 
Between Jobs
Medical Insurance Or Their House
 The home of Bob and Susie Hughes, in Conroe, Tex., north of Houston, is filled with mementos of a career abroad: dolls from Shanghai, an incense burner from Indonesia, a painting from Vietnam. Mr. Hughes admits he never thought much about health costs during his years as an executive and sales manager with several companies. That changed after Mr. Hughes left his last job in early 1992 as Southeast Asian sales manager for a petroleum equipment supplier, just as the company was going under.
With no new job in sight, the couple bought a private insurance policy. "They kept raising the premiums and the deductibility to the point where we couldn't afford it," he said of the premiums that jumped this year to $568 a month with a $2,500 deductible. "Faced with the choice of a house or medical insurance, I chose my house," he said. Their coverage ended two months ago.
"I've never taken unemployment from the state or the Federal Government," he said. "I've gone though my savings and I've had to take money from my 401(k). All I want is a little parachute."
Mr. Hughes said his main focus was on finding a job, not on politics, and he is active in Forty Plus, a group that helps experienced professional people find work. Asked about the Washington debate, he chuckled heartily. "I'd like to get the same kind of coverage Bob Dole gets for the same premium," he said, referring to the Republican Senator who has called universal coverage too expensive.
"I think if the Federal Government has their employees on a master plan, they ought to offer it to everybody in career transition," Mr. Hughes said.
 
Out of Reach
No Funds for Care Or for Insurance
 Enrique and Trinidad Estrada of San Francisco, parents of children aged 9, 7 and 4, are struggling toward the middle class. Mr. Estrada, who is 31 and has lived in this country nearly all his life, works all night delivering tortillas; his wife, who came from Mexico to marry him at age 19, works all day making burritos in a restaurant. Neither receives health benefits.
For years they lived with Mr. Estrada's parents, saving to buy their small blue house in the Mission District. To meet the $1,800 monthly payments they rent out the bottom floor for $700, cramming themselves into the top floor, where they have one bedroom and a fold-out sofa on which all three children sleep. Between house payments and baby sitters, Mrs. Estrada said, buying health insurance would be unthinkable.
Mrs. Estrada has not paid much attention to the battles in Washington over health care, but she wonders about the fairness of things. Because of their jobs and home ownership, she said, her family did not qualify for MediCal, the California version of Medicaid. "The people who are working -- why shouldn't we have it?" she asked. "I see people who are as young as I am begging on the streets, and they get everything from the Government."
Still, the Estradas do not seem to dwell on the issue of health care. Mr. Estrada has never been to a doctor. Mrs. Estrada received free care under a public program when she was pregnant, but has not seen a gynecologist in the four years since she gave birth, she said with no sense of alarm.
The children get low-cost checkups at a publicly financed clinic. "They look so healthy," Mrs. Estrada said, "and I don't worry about it."
But a painful condition in her right foot has caused her concern and highlighted the family's vulnerability. She had one operation at a cost of $300, which she paid in monthly installments. But the operation did not cure her, and doctors say she needs another procedure, which will cost $1,000. "It's going to be very difficult for us to find the money," she said.
 
Out of Luck
Aspiring Actor Gets Pneumonia
 Milo Pacheco is a 26-year-old aspiring actor who has lived in New York City since 1991, working as a waiter or bartender to pay the bills. Like many of his friends in the arts and the restaurant world, he was last covered during college, when he stayed on his parents' policy, but now he has no money to spare for insurance.
Until March he was lucky, paying for doctors as he needed them. Then disaster struck, a severe pneumonia and infected fluid around the lungs. He had a chest tube inserted and spent 18 days in the hospital, racking up bills of more than $25,000.
Mr. Pacheco said he now owed several thousand dollars for doctor bills and a CAT scan, which he will slowly pay off. A thoracic surgeon near his parents' home in southern New Jersey, where he sought treatment, was a guardian angel, accepting a surfboard in lieu of a hefty fee. The hospital is chalking off his $20,000 bill to charity care and will recoup much of that from the state and the bills of the well-insured.
Mr. Pacheco's experience has only added to the fears of his girlfriend, Lauren Bright, who is also 26 and waits tables between acting jobs. "When you're paying rent and trying to save a little money, you just hope that you don't get sick," she said.
She has avoided going to the doctor but is grateful that gynecological care, at least, is available on a sliding scale through Planned Parenthood. But now, largely because of the threat of health costs, she said, she is rethinking her choice of careers.
Mr. Pacheco and Ms. Bright both scoffed at the suggestion, made by some economists, that many young adults were not worried about living uninsured. Among people working in restaurants, who seldom receive benefits, for example, "health care is a regular topic of discussion these days," Mr. Pacheco said. "It's always a concern."
He added that he believed that employers ought to contribute at least a share of the cost of worker coverage, as President Clinton proposed.
Ms. Bright said she would welcome Government health subsidies; if a plan with complete coverage were made available in the range of $100 a month, she would take it. But existing cut-rate plans, she said, are not worth it because of their limited benefits.
"I have friends who are Australian and Canadian, and I so envy the fact that they have national health care," she said. "They end up waiting to go home to see a doctor."
 
Against Principles
Business Owner Hates Regulation
 A talk with Mark Elias, the woodworker, suggests why the President's proposals for universal coverage have not drawn an irresistible groundswell of support. Running his own business in Slidell, La., a gritty town east of New Orleans, and making an annual income of about $40,000, he feels he cannot afford to buy insurance for his own family, including his wife, a 13-year-old and 11-year-old twins, let alone his three employees. But his sense of independence extends to his attitude about Government regulation of health care.
The family has been uninsured for two years, since Mrs. Elias left a job with an insurance agency. They looked into buying a policy but especially in light of their desire to send their children to private school, they believed they could not afford rates of $300 a month, with a $2,500 deductible.
"Fortunately, we haven't had any kind of doctor bills," said Mr. Elias, who admits to some worry. He guesses that someone in the family goes to a doctor about once a year, but he cannot remember the last time anybody went.
"I'm not one to run to the doctor for every ache and pain," he said. "Maybe if I was older I'd be more concerned."
At its income, the Elias family would not qualify for subsidies under the main health care plans being debated in Washington, although proposed changes in insurance rules might reduce the price of available policies. Mr. Elias is dubious in any case.
"Even if it was a good deal, I'd rather not have the Government give me something," he said. "I'd rather not have my taxes go for social programs."
But he also knows that if medical catastrophe strikes, he could get help. "I'd probably have to go to the clinic," he said, referring to a nearby public medical center. "We'd work something out. They couldn't leave us out on the street, at least that's the way I understand it."

HEADLINE: South Waits Calmly as North's Transition Begins

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Monday, July 11

 BODY:
The death of the North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, has sent ripples of concern across the globe, but in this capital, just 30 miles from the border with the North, most people have responded with wariness and an enormous amount of curiosity.
South Korean officials have spent years and huge sums planning for precisely this moment, the death of their hard-line Communist nemesis, and they have constructed dozens of scenarios for taking advantage of any opportunities the transition might offer. 
 But the atmosphere here was noteworthy for its calm over the weekend, with the Government saying only that it was prepared to handle any unusual developments.
 
Party Leaders Summoned
 Reports from the isolated North depicted a nation deep in grief, but the transfer of power appeared to be proceeding without incident. Broadcasts from Pyongyang have been referring to Mr. Kim's son, Kim Jong Il, 52, as his father's rightful successor, and top members of the ruling Workers' Party have reportedly been summoned to the North Korean capital today, a step that some speculate could lead to Kim Jong Il's official election as party leader.
But here in Seoul on Sunday, the dusty parks were filled with a normal complement of families and strollers, the roads were knotted with afternoon traffic and there were no signs that the police had turned out in stronger numbers than usual.
Perhaps the only indication that this Sunday was unusual was the fact that most Government officials here could be reached in their offices, where they generally registered their satisfaction with the progress toward new leadership in the North so far.
The apparent calm speaks volumes about a subtle shift in South Korea's policy in recent years on reunification of the Korean Peninsula -- an issue that has cost more than 3 million lives, defined the political character of the region and at one time nearly brought the United States and China to war.
Only a few years ago, the Governments on either side of the Demilitarized Zone regarded the elimination of that barrier as an almost religious mission. If there was anything held in common by the two Koreas, one capitalist and one Communist, it was the shared passion for the swiftest possible reunification, although each wanted union on its own terms.
But that priority has changed, a fact highlighted by the markedly cautious response to Mr. Kim's death on Friday, reportedly from a heart attack, at the age of 82.
South Koreans still want the division bridged, but they now realize that anything that triggers a hasty, East German-style collapse of North Korea's faltering economy could wipe out the South's hard-won prosperity and lead to years of instability. That is a risk they no longer want to take, if it can be avoided.
The priority, in other words, is no longer removing a Government that South Korea regards as demonic and a barrier to reunification. The goal is to entice North Korea down the path of gradual economic reforms, even if that means the preservation for a time of the repressive, insulated and still dangerous leadership in Pyongyang.
This view has been bolstered in the last two years, as the old ideological divisions within South Korea have closed. The President, Kim Young Sam, is the first national leader in three decades who was not a general. The military's withdrawal from politics in South Korea has led to greater pragmatism here.
What is striking is that the South Koreans are sticking to this approach toward the North even if it means supporting the succession of Kim Jong Il. The younger Kim, referred to as "Dear Leader," is known as an erratic character and is suspected of having masterminded a number of terrorist attacks. Despite questions about his leadership, he appears to be smoothly consolidating his power.
He has been the designated heir for years, so he already controls several of the most powerful institutions in North Korea, including the military.
 
'Time for Keen Observation'
 "Our perception of Kim Jong Il is not favorable at all, that is true," said Kim Hak Joon, a political scientist who is chairman of the board of trustees at Dankook University and who was an adviser to the previous President, Roh Tae Woo. "But we realize our policy has to be realistic. It would be a mistake to show hostility toward Kim Jong Il. That is why this is a time for keen observation."
Of course, the calls for stability and calm reflect a desire to avoid any outbreak of violence at this unusually sensitive moment. At the least, the South Koreans are seeking to avoid a conflict at what is the most heavily armed border in the world.
Kim Young Sam, South Korea's reform-minded president, put his armed forces and police on alert after Kim Il Sung's death was announced, but he also instructed his troops to avoid provocations.
Government officials and experts at Government-controlled research centers say the low-key policy is also a result of a desire for drawing out the unification process.
 
Slow Approach Favored
 "Our best scenario is reunifying through dialogue and opening North Korea's economy, and that is a very slow process," said Kil Jeong Woo, Director of Policy Studies at the Research Institute for National Unification. "We need time to know each other and to narrow the gap between us economically. That is the optimum scenario.
"Our surveys show that an absolute majority of the people in South Korea favor gradualism. They don't want to threaten their prosperity."
In part, this shift in priorities is a product of South Korea's intensive analysis of German unification. That process, which happened with surprising speed after the fall of the Berlin Wall, was far more expensive than many had expected and left Germany with a heavy economic burden.
Researchers here say that the costs would be even greater in Korea, since the economic gulf between the Koreas is far wider than the one between East and West Germany. The per-capita output of North Korea is $943, one seventh that of South Korea.
 
Costs of Unification
 Estimates of the costs that South Korea would have to bear range from hundreds of billions of dollars to more than a trillion, spread out over a decade or so.
Those analyses have sobered the South Korean Government and pushed stability ahead of the emotional desire for reunification.
The focus is on easing military tensions on the peninsula and trying to defuse the crisis over North Korea's refusal to permit international inspections of its nuclear facilities, relying on negotiation rather than potentially destabilizing economic sanctions.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rate Rise Is Widely Expected

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Interest rates, particularly those controlled by the Federal Reserve Board, are headed higher, many credit market analysts and traders seem certain. The only unresolved questions, they say, are the timing and the size of the next Fed increase.
What they had viewed as a likely increase in the overnight Federal funds rate turned Friday into a virtual certainty, when the Labor Department released a skein of new and revised employment figures for April, May and June that suggested the economy was boiling along in the second quarter. 
 "We have created one million jobs in the last three months alone," said Paul Mastroddi, a managing director at J. P. Morgan & Company. "And various surveys, from the one conducted by Manpower Inc. to a rapidly rising help-wanted index, tell us this is going to continue."
 
View From Chicago Bank
 The strength of the employment report "warrants some sort of tightening" response by the Fed, said Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
"The economy certainly appears to be strong, we continue to eat up excess capacity in both the labor market and factory capacity utilization and we are starting to see consistent price increases at the input level, increases coming about because of strong demand," he said.
To most analysts, the timing of the new Fed move is not terribly important. It is likely to come, they said, sometime between now and Aug. 16, when the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to hold its next meeting.
Between now and then, the traders as well as Fed governors will have had the opportunity to sift through more economic and inflation data, much of it to be released this week.
 
Greenspan Testimony
 The Fed governors will presumably have to decide if they want to raise rates before Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, goes to Congress on July 20 to deliver his semiannual testimony on the Fed's outlook for the economy.
Given the past performance of the Greenspan Fed, a rise of one-quarter of a percentage point in the Federal funds rate, currently at 4.25 percent, would seem the most likely course.
But some analysts noted that the gradualist approach was not well received by financial markets in the first quarter. Rather than risk another period of market turbulence, during which questions about the Fed's resolve to fight inflation would again be raised, the analysts said, the Fed might choose to raise the Federal funds rate by half a percentage point and lift the discount rate, now at 3.50 percent, by a similar amount.
It is far from certain that even a half-point rise, which would mean the funds rate has gone up 1.75 percentage points in slightly more than six months, would preclude further tightening moves by the Fed this year.
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc., said he expected growth to moderate in the second half of the year. A half-point increase later this month or in August might be sufficient, he said.
 
Economy's Growing Strength
 But others said they were surprised by the underlying strength implied by the employment numbers. To ratchet down growth, higher interest rates will be needed, they said.
"At this point in the cycle, I think growth is fairly insensitive to interest rates," Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company, said. "We are at the part of the business cycle where things are buoyant, and I think it will take a long time to slow it down."
Until Friday, Mr. Liro said he had been expecting a second-half rally in the bond market. No longer.
"The economy has enough self-sustaining momentum to drive it at above potential growth for the next year or so," he said. "I think the Fed will be driving short rates higher, and I think long rates will follow."
After looking at the employment numbers, one money manager said he agreed that the Fed would tighten policy again.
But William H. Gross, a managing director at the Pacific Investment Management Company, which has more than $53 billion in fixed-income assets under management, said he believed the worst of the selloff in the bond market was over.
"We are not expecting an imminent return to a bull market," Mr. Gross said, "but the employment number probably represents a peak in all of the bearishness we have seen since early this year."
"I think we will move toward weaker " economic numbers in the second half of the year, he said.
Mr. Gross said he expected the yield on the 30-year bond, which ended Friday at 7.69 percent, its highest since early November 1992, to trade in a range of 7 percent to 8 percent during the next three months to six months.
Further tightening by the Fed would doubtless meet with at least some oratorical resistance from the Clinton Administration.
Indeed, on Friday, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said at the Group of Seven economic summit meeting in Naples that no interest rate increase by the Fed was immediately justified.
But analysts said such objections would be based on politics, not on real concern about what higher rates might do to the economic expansion.
"As long as the economy shows good growth, I don't think the Administration will fight another increase of one-quarter, one-half or even three-quarters" of a percentage point in the Federal funds rate, Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said.
"The moment the economy show some signs of recession, the Administration would be on a conflict path with the Fed," Mr. Sinai continued. "And interest rate increases of the sort I talked about would not do in the economy."
 
Dollar's Continued Influence
 The Administration -- and the bond market -- will probably continue to be pestered by a weak dollar, analysts said, even after the Fed raises interest rates.
"I think the dollar will continue to be a problem for the bond market, even though the employment data make a Fed tightening move more likely," John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said.
Offsetting an increase in short-term interest rates, Mr. Lipsky said, is the Administration's continued proclivity to change positions on its exchange rate policy.
In the days before the Naples meeting, Secretary Bentsen, the Administration's chief spokesman concerning the dollar, said the Administration vigorously supported a strong dollar. But Mr. Lipsky said that stance seemed to evaporate.
And Mr. Liro said, "I think the dollar will be one of the negatives weighing on the market."

HEADLINE: Unclimbed Summit;
The Talks Begin With Modest Aims And Indeed End With Much Undone

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NAPLES, July 10

 BODY:
Last year's economic summit conference, President Clinton said on Saturday, ended by "not accomplishing very much." This year, he suggested, "there was a real sense of confidence," and the achievements would therefore be greater.
If so, they were subtle, incremental and not very easy for most people to discern. 
 The really important thing about such meetings is not, in any case, what kinds of headlines or initiatives they produce, but whether they carry forward, from year to year, the process of cooperation among the world's strongest nations, which so often in the past have been such deadly rivals.
Politicians, journalists and the gala atmosphere surrounding these conferences often raise unreasonable expectations. The issue is not whether summit conferences change the world but whether they keep happening and keep providing a forum where leaders can schmooze.
"You need to step back," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in an interview, "and consider how remarkable it is that all the great powers in the world meet with each other and have good relations with each other and do business with each other."
 
Much Unfinished Business
 From that perspective, Naples was a success, even if the agenda of unfinished business remains long, even if Mr. Clinton had several very unsteady moments.
The President told his fellow leaders just before the conference opened that he opposed any early effort to prop up the dollar, because the American economy was healthier than the markets thought. The markets promptly battered the dollar further.He put forward a trade initiative and then, opposed by the French, pulled it back.
This afternoon, he expressed hope that his diplomacy had paved the way for the completion of Russian troop withdrawals from all the Baltic nations, including Estonia, by Aug. 31. President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, standing next to him, said a few minutes later that he could "say no" to withdrawal from Estonia by that date.
In each case, Mr. Clinton seemed to have gone just a bit beyond his brief, opening himself to embarrassment. On Estonia, for example, his aides said that while the outcome was far from clear, Mr. Yeltsin's agreement to discuss the issue personally with President Lennart Meri of Estonia for the first time was a hopeful sign.
 
A More Informal Approach
 On the other hand, Mr. Clinton succeeded in many of his aims, including the adoption of a more informal approach this year, with less predigestion of thorny issues by aides. He also persuaded his fellow leaders to focus on Iran as a sponsor of terrorism and to make specific promises of aid to Ukraine when some of them favored a more general approach. And he got the Russians to join in urging an end to the Arab boycott of Israel.
As the leaders of the seven principal industrialized nations concluded their annual talks, marked this year by the inclusion of President Yeltsin as a full participant in the political discourse, the words were optimistic, the body language cordial (handshakes all around, with a few bearhugs thrown in) and the weather stunning.
Even the smog lifted, giving the visiting big shots a postcard-perfect view of Vesuvius, Sorrento and Capri.
But for the most part the meeting followed its modest script, producing the expected endorsement of the Bosnian peace efforts; a pledge by all to ratify the new General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade, though it is unclear whether all the leaders can deliver on their promises; and an agreement to provide more money to Ukraine, some of it to pay for the initial stages of shutting down the dangerous Chernobyl nuclear reactors.
It is easy enough to enumerate things that were not done.
Caught by surprise like everyone else by the death of Kim Il Sung, the North Korean leader, the leaders could take no new steps on the crisis in that country. With the new Japanese Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, weakened both by his politically perilous position and a bout of intestinal illness, even less progress than anticipated was possible on the problems that result from his country's trade policies.
 
France Labors Alone
 None of the other six nations represented here stepped forward to offer to help France in its lonely effort to bring order to Rwanda through the dispatch of 2,500 troops to central Africa. Wider philosophical questions of peacekeeping and peacemaking -- when and where it should be undertaken, and by whom -- were notably absent.
One senior American official said that there was no agreement on what should be done if the Serbs fail to accept the terms of the current Bosnian peace proposals. Another said there was. The Europeans disagreed among themselves.
There were no notable initiatives intended to solve the most pressing problems of all. Mr. Clinton and his colleagues spoke of the cyclical recoveries that most of their nations are experiencing but they had few answers to the stubborn structural unemployment that has accompanied the rise of computers and mass communications. Compared with the fluctuations of the business cycle, long-term joblessness presents far tougher social, political and economic challenges.
Nor did the Naples summit do much to advance the process of creating a grand post-cold-war plan with institutions comparable to those that were put together in the 1950's. In the years since the Berlin wall came down and Communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, the leaders of the West have fiddled with the idea of a new world order, talked about reforming their institutions, but stopped there.
 
The How-To Is Not Addressed
 For the most part, they temporized again here. The final communique was marked mainly by expressions of good intentions, like this, "We are conscious of our responsibility to renew and revitalize these institutions and to take on the challenge of integrating the newly emerging market democracies." It was short on how-to.
Mr. Yeltsin, who came to power three years ago today, was clearly pleased to be included in the political talks. He promised that "the Russian bear is not going to try to break its way through an open door" to full G-7 membership, but there is still sharp disagreement among the seven on inviting him to play a bigger role in the group and on the future status of Eastern European nations.
It is no doubt true that the Group of Seven is an imperfect vehicle for making many of the decisions that must ultimately be made.
It is no doubt true, as Mr. Christopher and others have repeatedly said, that it is harder for the United States to lead in the increasingly multipolar world than it used to be, and that international organization is more difficult without a goal like the containment of Communism.
 
An Opportunity Missed
 But those explanations (or excuses) will last only for so long. All the presidents and prime ministers and officials and diplomats gathered here sense that they have only a limited time to realign the geopolitical pieces that have been scattered in the last few years, and that the longer they wait, the greater the chance of one or more explosions that will close the current window of opportunity.
To quote Mr. Clinton again, this is a "moment of historic economic, political and social change" that must be mastered. From that perspective, each summit meeting that passes without major progress on the broad questions facing the industrialized world is an opportunity dangerously missed.

HEADLINE: Bankers Competing to Lend In New York's Poorer Areas

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
When Robert Cohen wanted to buy two Tudor-style buildings at the corner of Cruger Avenue and Pelham Parkway in the Bronx in 1991, he had trouble finding a bank that would lend him the money. Taking the one loan he could find at the time, he purchased the buildings and renovated everything from the boilers to the elevators to the mortar holding the rust-red bricks together.
Now, as Mr. Cohen tries to refinance the buildings, he has four or five banks competing for his business. His next-door neighbor has also been able to borrow enough money to renovate his building. They are among many landlords benefiting from new sources of money streaming into working-class neighborhoods like theirs in the Bronx and the city as a whole. 
 Over the last two years, borrowers in such neighborhoods who used to go begging for mortgages are finding that more and more banks are willing to lend them money. The increased lending in these areas is having a ripple effect, improving the housing stock and generally helping stabilize neighborhoods that had been teetering on the edge of decline.
With the economic downturn and the banking crisis of the late 1980's and early 90's behind them, banks and thrift institutions are better equipped to lend. But the real-estate market for commercial and larger residential properties still has not rebounded, so lenders are looking beyond their traditional investments to smaller loans -- under $1 million -- in what they used to consider risky neighborhoods.
"There is too much competition for the markets in the better areas of Manhattan, and even in places like Riverdale," said Jeffrey Denler, vice-president for multifamily lending at First Federal Savings and Loan of Rochester. "A lot of lenders are looking to other areas and finding that loans in neighborhoods they never looked at are just as safe."
The new wave of loans has not yet reached the city's most troubled areas but instead solid working-class neighborhoods where landlords can count on receiving their rent. Landlords in Mott Haven and Morrisania in the Bronx and East New York in Brooklyn still have to jump through an extraordinary series of hoops to get loans. But their counterparts in Pelham Parkway and Fordham, Crown Heights and Fort Greene now have more access to money to renovate their buildings and revitalize their immediate areas.
The turnaround is most striking in the Bronx, where whole neighborhoods in the late 1960's and 70's succumbed to abandonment or arson. In that atmosphere of decline, private lending all but stopped and never reached more than a trickle thereafter, primarily in the northwest of the borough.
Now some buildings in these neighborhoods, typically four- or five-story buildings with 50 to 100 apartments, lacking elevators but solidly built in the years before World War II, are being refurbished.
Although most of the loans in the Bronx are in the neighborhoods bordering Fordham Road and Pelham Parkway, the borough's version of the proverbial tracks, some lenders are now financing buildings in the South Bronx, near Yankee Stadium and the courthouse.
 
Loans Create Ripples
 The lending is already having a visible effect on these neighborhoods, helping to draw in even more money.
"As a lender you're surprised, but you do see some transformation in the way the buildings have been maintained," Sam Giarrusso, vice-president of East New York Savings Bank, said of a trip he recently took to see some buildings along the Grand Concourse and Jerome Avenue in the South Bronx. "I think there's a bit of a stigma there, but we will look at buildings selectively for owners that have a proven track record."
A strong demand from families searching for affordable apartments has encouraged both bankers and building owners to consider investing in neighborhoods they used to consider somewhat risky, such as those in the mid-Bronx, mid-Brooklyn and upper Manhattan. Low interest rates over the last two years have also made it more feasible for owners to borrow money.
A few banks lent money in the Bronx through the 1980's, and their programs are expanding. Since January, First Federal has financed 15 mortgages, worth $12.5 million, in the Bronx as compared to eight loans worth $5.5 million in all of 1993. Fourth Federal Savings Bank, which lent about $2 million a year in the Bronx in 1990 and 1991, closed on $11 million worth of loans in 1993. Lenders also say there is more competition to lend money in the Bronx.
 
Freddie Mac Is Back
 In addition, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, has begun lending money for multifamily buildings again after a three-year hiatus. Freddie Mac was the city's largest mortgage lender for apartment buildings in the 1980's, but canceled its lending program in 1991 because of a high default rate. The agency resumed lending to landlords in December, and wants to commit $600 million in the northeast region by the end of 1994, said H. L. Van Varick, director of production and product development for multifamily lending in this region.
But Freddie Mac has had trouble meeting that goal, and has only committed $50 million so far. Mr. Van Varick said the agency needed time to let borrowers know it was back in the market, but also is up against many more competitors than before.
There are two explanations for the growing interest in lending, and most bankers and building owners offer a combination of them. The first is internal: banks are stronger.
"The city's economy hasn't changed," said Robert Chambrey, a mortgage broker who is active in the Bronx. "The banking industry is healthier. Of the six banks I work with in the Bronx, three weren't in the market three years ago."
 
City Changes, Too
 But others say bankers are responding to changes in the city itself, particularly in the Bronx, where city and neighborhood development groups have helped rejuvenate many neighborhoods over the last decade. When lenders visit potential borrowers' buildings in the South Bronx now, they are as likely to see a block filled with viable, working buildings as a set of burned-out shells.
"The economy is stronger and the city's programs have given the Bronx a shot in the arm," said Richard Pergolis, another mortgage broker who grew up in the Bronx and has worked with building owners there for 14 years. "They weren't just putting fancy pictures in the windows of burned out buildings. There are real people in those buildings now. That's massive progress."
Public progress has led to private gains, as bankers are more willing to gamble on new neighborhoods. For example, Mr. Pergolis's firm, Pergolis Swartz, has helped finance 115 properties in the Bronx in the last two years, worth $100 million, about 10 times greater than their volume of business in the previous two years.
While banks are increasingly willing to lend, they are nonetheless careful about whom they lend to. They say they are most comfortable with professional owner-managers, who have a history with the bank and in the borough, and who have the resources to screen tenants and press for rent payments, two keys to success in lower-income neighborhoods.
 
Professional Landlords
 More lending, then, has given rise to more large-scale ownership, with landlords holding 30, 40 or even 100 buildings in the Bronx. Many of these owners have expanded their holdings by buying buildings that earlier Freddie Mac borrowers defaulted on.
These professional owners, in turn, are able to convince their banks to support ventures in other Bronx neighborhoods, ever farther south.
"The lenders kind of follow major building owners into those areas," said Mr. Denler of First Federal. "There had been a period of deterioration in those neighborhoods but now we have gotten to the point where lenders and managers are no longer afraid to invest there."
Jeffrey Levine has seen a new spurt of interest in the work buildings he renovates in the Bronx, in Harlem and in Flatbush, just south of Prospect Park. He said that until two years ago, he had difficulty finding private lenders outside of the Community Preservation Corporation, which pools public and private money for real-estate deals in poor neighborhoods, and Chemical Bank's community investment group.
 
Interest and Credit
 "All of a sudden there is a flurry of banks that were not familiar with these areas before that are now looking to lend in them," Mr. Levine said. "Banks are anxious to lend money where the economics are good, and even more in communities where they can get credit for their loans."
Banks must meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements, investing a certain percentage in neighborhoods where they have branches. These loans can help meet those requirements and also helps them boost their community relations credit. Whether the lending trend will continue depends on the economy, and extending it to poorer neighborhoods may require government subsidies to bring banks into the market.
Still, owners are optimistic. David Ribler held onto four buildings in the Bronx through the 1970's, but sold three others in the South Bronx when they were the only thing standing in the rubble of their neighborhoods.
"I think it's beneficial for the borough," Mr. Ribler, who grew up in Kingsbridge Heights, said of the new money for owners. "I'm not the only one who stayed. Hopefully the people who did will reap the rewards now."

HEADLINE: For United Pilots, 2 Views of Buyout

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
They fly the same type of plane, a Boeing 737, and they have worked for the same airline, United, for at least 25 years. And since 1985 Roger D. Hall and George T. Lenormand have been players in one of Corporate America's longest-running soap operas.
The finale may come tomorrow, when United shareholders will vote on whether to approve the employees' offer of wage and work-rule concessions in return for 55 percent of the UAL Corporation, the airline's parent. 
 If the deal is approved, UAL will become the nation's largest employee-owned company, and Mr. Hall, leader of the pilots union, will have prevailed. But such a move would be cause for apprehension for Mr. Le-normand, who worked through the pilots strike in 1985, is an active lobbyist against the buyout effort and has done financial analyses on the buyout for a group of United pilots who want a new vote by all the pilots, rather than by their representatives.
"The world is changing and we're trying to address that change," said Mr. Hall, 55, the chairman of the United division of the Air Line Pilots Association. "We have come up with a very creative approach, one that is going to provide a lot of benefit."
Mr. Hall, a native of Peoria, Ill., who now lives in Los Altos, Calif., added, "We're on the leading edge of labor-management relations."
But Mr. Lenormand, 50, worries that the leading edge might be on the face of a cliff. "To buy the airline just because you want to have some sense of control doesn't make any sense," he said. "I hope I'm wrong, but this is a lose-lose proposition."
Mr. Lenormand, a Manhattan native who currently lives in Denver, said he believed the employee buyout would hamstring the company financially and would not by itself help change the corporate culture so that employees think more as owners do, particularly since so many employees are either not involved or are opposed to the buyout.
"A business isn't a great social experiment," said Mr. Lenormand, who received a master's degree in business administration from Fairleigh Dickinson University. "I went through all these stupid management courses, and when it comes down to it, the only time this stuff works is when you are doing well."
UAL's operating losses during the last three years totaled $769 million. Its net losses over the same period were $1.34 billion.
Under the proposal that shareholders will vote on tomorrow, employees would receive 55 percent of UAL in exchange for $4.9 billion in wage and work-rule concessions over six years. Stockholders would receive $84.81 in cash for each share they own, and would continue to own 45 percent of UAL.
To be sure, the employees who may soon own most of United are not united themselves. Flight attendants, who have the most contact with passengers, are not part of the deal. And many pilots, machinists and nonunion workers oppose it.
A survey commissioned by a group of United pilots after the union's 28-member council ratified the buyout proposal found that of the 1,750 pilots who responded, 1,200 said they opposed the buyout. UAL's law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, sent a letter to the pilots containing a thinly veiled threat that if they publicized the results, the company would sue them.
The story of the United buyout effort began in 1985, when the union waged its only strike against United over pay and over how long newly hired pilots could be paid less than longtime pilots. The company had asked for concessions from the pilots, who disagreed with the airline company's diversification into hotels and rental car businesses.
Mr. Hall, who was chairman of the United pilots' union at the time, recalls sitting in a meeting during the 29-day strike with the lawyer F. Lee Bailey, who suggested that the union acquire a majority stake in the company so that it could have a say in blocking other strategies it considered misguided.
 
Earlier Buyout Attempts
 "About the only way you're ever going to solve these long-term problems," Mr. Hall recalled Mr. Bailey saying at the time, "is to buy the company."
On several occasions, the pilots tried, in concert with various partners, to acquire United. One notable failure occurred in 1989, when financing for a buyout collapsed, setting off a case of market jitters that led to a 190-point one-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. During several days before and after the buyout collapsed, the value of UAL's stock fell by more than a third, as arbitragers saw the value of their investments drop by more than $500 million.
The latest proposal took root in 1992, when Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of United, approached the union and reiterated his concern about United's high labor costs and the need for wage and productivity concessions. Without them, he said, United would have to sell assets and pull out of unprofitable routes.
The pilots suggested that they and other employees consider concessions in return for majority control of United, and United's management responded with interest. Over the next year, negotiations broke off and revived several times before United's board approved a proposal in late December. The machinists and pilots unions approved it earlier this year, setting the stage for tomorrow's vote.
If the deal goes through, the pilots will have one seat on the company's 12-person board, as will the machinists union and the company's nonunion workers.
In addition to a 15.7 percent wage cut, the pilots agreed to more flexible work rules that would enable the company to set up a no-frills shuttle service fashioned after Southwest Airlines. The machinists agreed to a 9.7 percent wage cut, and the other employees agreed to an 8.25 percent cut. One goal of the deal is to stem United's heavy losses on many shorter domestic routes.
Besides giving the employees equity in the company, the buyout agreement would provide some protection by restricting the company's ability to lay off unionized employees, subcontract work and sell major assets.
 
Weakened Balance Sheet
 The company's balance sheet would be weakened immediately by the transaction, with the removal of about $1 billion from cash reserves and the addition of about $1.15 billion in debt and preferred stock. Newly issued shares would be worth 45 percent of the company, and would trade considerably below the current value of UAL stock, which closed Friday at $129.50, down 75 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The prospect of increased control by labor over United's strategic decisions is illusory, Mr. Lenormand said. With one seat on the board, the pilots would not hold much sway over company strategy, particularly if industry economics demanded that cuts be made.
"It's a nice thought, but in practice it is not going to work," he said. "In the long run, the economics rule."
Mr. Lenormand, who believes a less sweeping solution to some of United's problems could be worked out between the union and United's current management, said he was mainly concerned about the addition of debt and stripping out $1 billion from the company's cash reserves, most of which is going to shareholders.
In an unpredictable business where competitors are forced to match one other's prices, the airline with the strongest balance sheet will always win, he said.
"The cash is the blood of any company, and without blood, what happens?" he said, quoting one of his former business professors.
But United said that it would still have $1.5 billion in cash reserves after the buyout, among the richest reserves of any airline.
While the additional debt is significant, it is still small relative to UAL's current $16 billion in debt and leases, said Philip Baggaley, a transportation industry analyst for the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency.
Mr. Baggaley said he harbored greater concerns for the company's creditworthiness if the deal failed than if it went through, because the unions promised to retaliate fiercely if the company started selling assets.
"There are some large positives and large negatives associated with the buyout," Mr. Baggaley said. "Depending on which you choose to focus on, you can spin out a very optimistic or pessimistic story."

HEADLINE: A Vision for an Asbury Park Hotel

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK, N.J.

 BODY:
Bruce Springsteen crooned tributes to this beach town in the 1970's, but it has long since fallen from grace. Years of economic decline have left the Palace Amusements building dilapidated and the souvenir shops deserted. On most days, gulls share the weathered boardwalk with sad-faced wanderers.
Now an unlikely champion -- the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi -- has offered the city hope, not just for the comeback of its tourism business but, his followers say, for a revival in more ethereal ways as well. 
 The Maharishi, 83, a former Hindu monk and spiritual adviser to the Beatles, recently opened two transcendental meditation schools and a holistic health center in Asbury Park's oldest hotel, the elegant Berkeley-Carteret. His nonprofit company, World Plan Executive Council, bought the building in March for $1.85 million.
 
'Little Seaside Haven'
 "We chose Asbury because we wanted to be near the ocean," said Richard Quinn, who manages the hotel with his wife, Linda. "If enough people come here and meditate, it will become an idyllic little seaside haven."
Mayor Patricia Candiano said she is optimistic that the town will profit from the Maharishi's venture. "In order for people to visit Asbury, there has to be a viable hotel," she said. "They seem to be a very good group, and they seem to be making money."
While the Quinns will continue to operate the 250-room Berkeley-Carteret as a hotel and conference center, they expect the meditation schools will be equally important in attracting guests. The schools will teach "Vedic knowledge," theories of nature from sacred Hindu texts. They will offer courses in architecture, business and other subjects from the Vedic point of view -- that of a single reality underlying all things. Daily introductory courses are usually attended by only a handful of people, but Mr. Quinn said the schools' first weekend conference, in April, drew 160 people.
If enough people meditate at the hotel, the owners say, positive energy will nourish the troubled town.
Asbury Park, a working-class community 60 miles from New York City, has struggled for years to reclaim its status as a popular vacation spot. It has been in decline since the 1950's, when the Garden State Parkway opened and tourists started visiting shore towns further south.
Race riots in the early 1970's caused more flight, and many of the town's Victorian homes have become boarding houses for former psychiatric patients, further diminishing its tax base.
The Maharishi is not the first investor with high hopes for Asbury Park, which has a population of 16,800. A group of businessmen tried to transform the town in the 1980's with a $500 million redevelopment project, including an $18 million renovation of the Berkeley-Carteret. But bankruptcies and litigation delayed the project indefinitely.
Meanwhile, other problems have gnawed at the town's dignity, including the resignation of Mayor Dennis Buckley in March after he was arrested for cocaine possession.
 
Seeking 'Pure Consciousness'
 None of this fazes the Maharishi's followers, who assert that transcendental meditation can reduce crime and drug abuse. When a large group of people meditate together, he says, they reach a state of "pure consciousness" that can affect entire communities. His followers have meditated en masse in Washington and Los Angeles, hoping to cure urban blight.
"We like having a positive influence on an oppressed area," Mr. Quinn said. "When your activities create an air of freshness, they refresh the environment."
For Asbury Park, the Maharishi's purchase has already brought financial relief: the $1.85 million price tag for the 69-year-old hotel included $1.25 million in back taxes and liens, Mr. Quinn said. In 1991, the former owners of the hotel defaulted on bank loans, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over.
The Maharishi, who lives in the Netherlands, where his company is based, has never been to Asbury Park and rarely visits the United States. The Berkeley-Carteret is his first East Coast hotel. Mr. Quinn said the World Plan Executive Council has bought 15 hotels in this country to house meditation schools, and plans to have one in every state.
The corporate headquarters for the Maharishi's hotel chain has been relocated from Houston to Asbury Park, as well as the administrative offices for his university system, which includes an accredited school in Fairfield, Iowa.
"It's a popular town, a beautiful hotel and the price was right," Mr. Quinn said. "A lot of people won't invest in a place like this, but we've never been afraid."
Mayor Candiano said she supported the new owners' plans. "We're just happy that the hotel is open for business, and that the Quinns are abiding by the rules," she said. "We don't mind them offering classes there. If anything, it's good for business."
Mr. Quinn said a seven-session meditation course costs $1,000. Tuition fees support research on transcendental meditation, he said.
The Quinns say they will keep the decor -- which includes terrazzo floors, arched windows and three ornate ballrooms -- but are making other changes. A vegetarian restaurant will open in the hotel this summer, and the gift shop will feature New Age merchandise, including the Maharishi's line of vitamins.
So far, the changes have not deterred non-meditating customers; the Berkeley-Carteret was booked solid for the July 4 weekend, and several dozen banquets, conferences and weddings are planned for this summer, Mr. Quinn said.
If local interest grows, Mr. Quinn said his staff might offer meditation classes in schools, hospitals and community centers. If the schools are a success, he added, World Plan will buy more property in Asbury Park.
The group is considering the nearby, vacant Convention Hall for a "Veda Vision" theater, which would use special effects to explain Vedic knowledge, Mr. Quinn said. Mayor Candiano insisted, however, that city landmarks like the Convention Hall would never be sold. "The citizens would never stand for it," she said.
But Danielle Richards, a waitress who lives near the hotel, said the Maharishi and his followers should buy more property if it will help Asbury Park.
"If they believe meditation will save this town, let them do it wherever they want," she said, squinting at the hotel as she walked her dog. "Asbury has tried everything else, so why not give these Maharishi guys a chance?"

HEADLINE: For This Court Choice, Policy Is Passion

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
When the Senate Judiciary Committee takes up the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Stephen G. Breyer on Tuesday, the focus of the discussion will probably be profoundly different from confirmation proceedings of recent years.
The issues expected to be considered most intensively with Judge Breyer are not emotion-laden subjects like abortion, the death penalty and freedom of speech. Rather, the focus will most likely be on economic regulation: the authority of the Government to affect the marketplace, the responsibilities of corporations and the choices available to citizens. 
 That change is due, in part, to how much the Supreme Court has receded for the time being as the stage upon which the nation's most pressing social problems are played out. But it is also a reflection of the man President Clinton has selected to be the nation's 108th justice of the Supreme Court.
Judge Breyer, who has written extensively and provocatively about government regulation, is regularly described as a "technocrat lawyer," someone enamored of the intricacies of public policy rather than the more traditional elements of constitutional law.
As the Supreme Court prepares to enter the 21st century, many scholars predict that its workload and its most heated debates will involve just such issues of government regulation.
 
Policy Disputes on the Docket
 In the past, courts were infrequently involved in those kinds of public policy disputes. But such questions are increasingly coming before the court as Congress passes more statutes that the executive branch interprets into regulations -- and a dissatisfied person challenges in a lawsuit.
In this manner, the Court may find itself refereeing tangled questions like how much should the Government spend on AIDS research as compared with cancer research? When Congress orders the cleanup of toxic dumps, should the Government spend large sums to make them squeaky clean or just the amount needed to make them clean enough to be reasonably safe?
Those are exactly the kinds of questions with which Judge Breyer has occupied himself.
Judge Breyer, who is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, has outlined his theories of regulation in two books, the most recent published last year. And as a senior Congressional aide in the 1970's he was able to see his theories put into practice when he was the principal architect of deregulating the nation's airlines. Airline deregulation was a bold policy experiment that continues to provoke heated debate, both from scholars and from ordinary air travelers befuddled by ever-changing and incomprehensible fare schedules.
In his 1993 book, "Breaking the Vicious Circle, Toward Effective Risk Regulation" (Harvard University Press), Judge Breyer painted a portrait of Federal regulators and Congress continually wasting resources because of distorted priorities in areas like toxic dumps and dangerous food additives. The regulators and lawmakers devote resources to the wrong problems, Judge Breyer wrote, because they are too sensitive to public opinion.
Many of the situations he cites in his book are from court cases in which judges ruled on Federal agencies' regulations. Judge Breyer argued that exaggerated public fears about the potential damage of breathing asbestos, for example, have produced an unwise and costly rush to clean up asbestos in buildings.
In a 1992 case he cites with approval, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down an ambitious plan by the Environmental Protection Agency to remove asbestos. The agency wanted to spend a quarter billion dollars in hopes of saving an estimated seven or eight lives over a 13-year period. The court said the nation could expect that many deaths from individuals swallowing toothpicks.
Regulators, he wrote, will pay extra attention to risks that come to the public's attention and, he noted, "Study after study shows that the public's evaluation of risk problems differs radically from any consensus of experts."
Ralph Nader, the public interest lobbyist, who is one of Judge Breyer's most vocal critics, has depicted him as instinctively distrustful of all government regulation and a servant of corporate interests.
Mr. Nader said in an interview that Judge Breyer was a compilation of "bad scholarship, bad analysis and an extremely corporatist outlook." He said the 1993 Breyer book relied heavily on corporate-financed studies to discredit regulation.
But Joel Klein, the deputy White House counsel, who has long followed the Supreme Court, disputed that characterization. He described Judge Breyer's views as an effort to make rational the Government's efforts to deal with competing demands.
"The debate has been miscast by Judge Breyer's critics," Mr. Klein said. "He is hardly an unalloyed critic of the regulatory process. His whole point is that when you have so many competing demands, the regulatory dollar has to be carefully scrutinized. A marginal cleanup of pollution, for example, could be better used on child health care."
But Mr. Nader, who is expected to testify against the Breyer nomination, said that such reasoning falsely pitted one need against another. "That is drawing the line far too tightly," he said, arguing that reducing corporate subsidies would give Government regulators the money to accomplish both goals.
Despite Judge Breyer's critics, there is little doubt that he will be easily confirmed to replace Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who has retired, and that he will take his seat in time for the Court's opening in October.
Nonetheless, Judge Breyer has intensively prepared for the hearings, sitting for several days in Room 145 of the Old Executive Office Building as White House lawyers and others pepper him with questions he is likely to be asked by the Judiciary Committee. He has also watched videotapes of recent confirmation hearings.
 
Amending an Image
 As the confirmation process has come to resemble a political campaign, most of the recent Supreme Court nominees have arrived at the confirmation hearings with carefully tailored images to present. Justice Clarence Thomas spoke at length in 1991 about his impoverished childhood in Pinpoint, Ga., a theme that came to be known as the "Pinpoint confirmation strategy." Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a native of Brooklyn, similarly dwelt on her childhood last year, and her story was labeled "the Flatbush strategy."
Even Justice David H. Souter, the ascetic New Hampshire judge, apparently felt a need to present a warm, personal side when he said at his 1990 hearing that he had suddenly recalled the anguish of a student he once counseled over whether the student should help his girlfriend get an abortion.
In what appears to be an effort to retouch his image as an elite lawyer-philosopher, Judge Breyer has recently sought to describe himself as a populist. When he met with Mr. Clinton in the Rose Garden after his nomination, he described himself as a people's lawyer.
As a pillar of the Eastern academic-government axis, Judge Breyer, a former professor at Harvard Law School, had not generally been thought of that way. In his writings about regulation, for example, his solution to the problems of misplaced regulatory resources is decidedly elitist: he has proposed the creation of a corps of highly knowledgeable super-bureaucrats that would have the authority to override popular sentiment and Congressional directives.
In addition, apparently to counter the image of someone who has never gotten his hands dirty from contact with the workaday world, Judge Breyer listed on his Supreme Court application a summer job he once held as a "ditch digger" for a San Francisco utility. Other judicial nominees do not typically include their high school summer jobs, but the Breyer entry, with its Jack Kerouac touch, seems designed to show a broad range of experience.

HEADLINE: Buildings Department Irks Niche Professionals

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Can't fight City Hall? Try the New York City Department of Buildings.
"They are trying to prevent me from earning a living," said Carlos Burbano, owner of CCBS Consulting, as he stood in line the other day at the department's fortresslike headquarters in lower Manhattan, his arms filled with paperwork and his voice rising in anger. 
 Judith Faulkner, standing in the same line, complained: "I have one little specialty that is very useful to the city. Now they are trying to shut me down."
That specialty is the arcane business of "expediting" building permits, blueprint inspections and code applications through what may be the nation's most complicated big-city construction regulations. And for 1,600 registered expediters doing business with the Department of Buildings, a regulatory gauntlet has been thrown down.
No one denies that the expediters perform a necessary and probably permanent job. Much of their work is standing in line -- or adroitly jumping from line to line -- as representatives of architects, engineers and building owners who have neither the time nor patience to deal with the department's regulatory maze.
But in what may result in a court battle, the city's Commissioner of Buildings, Charles A. Miele, is threatening to bar the expediters from technical discussions with the department's assorted plan examiners, borough superintendents and technical personnel.
 
Crossing the Line?
 "I'm not trying to put anybody out of business," said Mr. Miele, who left his practice in February as a partner in a Queens architecture and engineering firm to take over the department. No stranger to the business of expediting, Mr. Miele, a licensed engineer, got his start in the 1950's working as an expediter himself.
Still, he said, "a clear line has been crossed from expediting into architecture and engineering." In official memos, distributed among the expediters in April and May, he said he would prohibit them from engaging in "architectural and engineering discussions" with his staff.
The discussions might involve such questions as whether the city's minimum requirement for apartment room size, 150 square feet, can be slightly amended in a homeless shelter or whether requirements for the placement of smoke detectors can be altered if additional detectors are installed.
Only people who are licensed as architects or engineers, or who are employed full time by architects or engineers, would be allowed to take part, according to Mr. Miele's dictate.
"This is purely and simply a legal issue," he said in an interview in his 14th-floor office at the Department of Buildings, citing the New York State Education Law. In part, that law says that people must be licensed as architects or engineers to engage in "consultation" or "evaluation" in architectural or engineering work.
Nine floors below, where the legion of expediters make their daily rounds, few people found his position either pure or simple.
 
Raw Nerves
 "My theory is that this rule change is intended to allow architects and engineers to recapture some income," said David Trachtenberg, owner of Novation, an expediting firm, and president of the New York Association of Code Consultants, an expediting industry group. He said the group would fight Mr. Miele in court.
In the face of virulent opposition, Mr. Miele has delayed the new rule, which he once announced would be in place by July 1.
"This issue has touched a very raw nerve," he said, adding that some letters to his office on the proposed rule had been "appalling in their filth." Now, although it may take until the end of the year and a court ruling, he said, "I believe the legal issue is clear and I intend to see this resolved."
Whatever the outcome, the battle has underscored the importance of an industry that operates largely behind the scenes in the huge bureaucratic theater of New York, and serves as a reminder of how government regulation creates both added costs for industry and profitable opportunities for those who can smooth the system's bureaucratic edges.
Although expediters ply their trade in the corridors of several regulatory agencies, including the Department of Transportation and the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Buildings has always been their reason for being.
That is because of the vast layers of building regulations that must be met: separate codes for buildings that went up before and after 1968, fire safety codes, zoning ordinances, asbestos removal requirements, a law mandating access for the handicapped and dozens of other legal strictures.
The result is big business for expediters, who, according to Mr. Trachtenberg's group, take in $30 million a year. Typically, an expediter will charge $2,000 to handle a building permit application, even if it is routinely approved. Mr. Burbano said he charged $90 an hour for his services.
 
From Line to Line
 By far the biggest part of an expediter's job -- at least as measured in time -- is moving from line to line, and from application to application, at Department of Buildings offices in all five boroughs.
Many people in the business are inexperienced college students or others who are hired simply to stand in line and deliver papers. Indeed, the most highly paid expediters, like Mr. Burbano, sometimes hire expediters of their own for the most tedious waits.
All adhere to long-standing rules of conduct -- sometimes mystifying to outsiders -- that are intended to speed the passage through bureaucratic red tape. In some corridors of the department, the expediters arrive early each morning and leave their briefcases or stacks of documents lined up on the floor in what appear to be small ceremonial mounds, but are in fact intended to hold their places for appointments hours later in the day.
Both Mr. Miele and the expediters say that less than 5 percent of the work includes technical discussions with Department of Buildings personnel, and those tasks are usually reserved for expediters with years of experience in reading the fine print of building regulations.
But it is those discussions that many claim to be the most critical service the expediters perform, since they relieve licensed architects and engineers of the need to spend hours or days waiting for appointments with department inspectors.
The expediters are already prohibited from signing applications on behalf of their clients or making any changes in the blueprints or other paperwork they submit for their clients. They say the discussions that would be barred by Mr. Miele simply enable them to act as liaisons and messengers between the architects and engineers who pay their fees and the inspectors who want more-detailed information on a blueprint or permit application.
"We are not practicing architecture, but negotiating over procedure," said Mr. Trachtenberg, who, like many expediters, often represents five or more clients in a single visit to the department. If Mr. Miele succeeds in imposing his new rule, "there will be architects and engineers lined up way down the halls," he added.
 
Support Is Lukewarm
 Among architects, engineers and building owners, Mr. Miele's proposal has drawn mixed reviews. Although some say it would increase their costs and professional aggravations by forcing them to assign their own staff members to the Department of Buildings, or hire additional workers, others maintain that it would increase the level of professionalism.
Some also acknowledged that the city's weak economy and construction downturn had left many architectural and engineering firms with little work and ample time to take on a larger part of the burden in dealing with city regulations.
Under the new rule, "we would be doing more of the job we were licensed to do," said Michael Zenreich, a Manhattan architect and chairman of the code committee of the New York City chapter of the American Institute of Architecture. He said some architects, particularly those with small firms, would welcome any new work, even if it meant dealing with the Department of Buildings bureaucracy.
Mr. Zenreich's committee sent a letter to Mr. Miele last month, supporting his proposed restrictions on expediters. But the support is lukewarm.
"The Buildings Department feels strongly on this one, and we are willing to agree, even though it will inconvenience some of our people," Mr. Zenreich said. But he added that architects "will continue using a lot of expediters -- they are part of the team."

HEADLINE: Ultrair Shutting Its Operations

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Ultrair Inc., which serves Florida and Alabama from Kennedy International Airport in New York, will shut down after Wednesday.
The airline, which made the announcement on Friday, promised full refunds for any passengers with tickets for flights after that date. Ultrair said a battle for market share on the East Coast made it economically impossible to continue as the large carriers cut their fares. 
 "While Ultrair has strong financial backing, we don't think it makes good business sense to keep flying in markets where there is so little prospect of making money," Ultrair's chief executive, J. Patrick Millinor Jr., said on Friday. The carrier will evaluate its options and opportunities over the coming months, he added.
This is Ultrair's second incarnation. It flew for six months starting in January 1993 as a luxury airline based in Houston. It shut down last summer, blaming price wars with larger carriers, particularly Continental Airlines.
It was reborn in November, offering service from Kennedy airport to Miami, Orlando, West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Later, the carrier added service to Birmingham and Mobile, Ala.

Notre Dame Draws Big East's Approval

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
Four months after Notre Dame's interest in the Big East was said to have lessened considerably, the Fighting Irish have been approved as the 13th member of the conference. A person familiar with the discussions between the university and the league, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed reports published over the weekend that a commitment was imminent and added that announcements were planned for today.
Notre Dame joins the league after what is believed to be a unanimous vote of the 12 members, including Rutgers and West Virginia, who were admitted last March 9. According to the source, Notre Dame's participation will take effect during the 1995-96 season for all sports except football, in which the Irish will remain an independent. 
The struggle in recent years of Notre Dame's men's basketball program has fueled speculation that the school would eventually have to abandon its status as an independent in the sport to gain the benefits of a high-profile league. That speculation reached its peak late last winter, as differences between football and basketball interests within the Big East created what Commissioner Mike Tranghese called the most serious threat in the history of the conference.
Notre Dame was interested in the possibility of a new, scaled-down Big East that would have resulted had those schools with major college football commitments carried through with their threat to form a separate all-sports conference. The Irish were one of several teams that could have been added to the schools without major football commitments: Connecticut, Georgetown, St. John's, Seton Hall, Providence and Villanova.
But the league saved itself with the compromise admission of Rutgers and West Virginia, a move that secured the continued full-time membership of Boston College, Miami, Pittsburgh and Syracuse. The financial prospect of splitting revenues with at least 12 other members in an enlarged Big East was seen as being less appealing to the Irish.
Dick Rosenthal, the Notre Dame athletic director, said at the time that while campus leaders were considering future commitments, he continued to feel that joining a conference was not essential. He was confident that the university could succeed in men's basketball while maintaining its independent status. Attempts to reach several Notre Dame officials yesterday were unsuccessful.
 
'Changed Its Mind'
 Those less appealing economic benefits of a large league, added to the the logistical wrestling Big East officials have undergone to create an expanded format for regular-season play and its conference tournament, seemed to make both sides less likely come together.
Until now. "Notre Dame changed its mind," the source said.
The new alliance will create a marriage between the Fighting Irish and Miami, which ended a hostile football series in the 1989 season. One longterm effect of Notre Dame's addition could be to strengthen the relationship to the point that the football rivalry could be resumed as a nonconference game for Miami.

HEADLINE: The Harm in a Budget Ideology

 BODY:
The House plans to vote soon on proposals that would amend procedures for passing the budget. The sponsors say their goal is to cut out fat and reduce the deficit. But the unstated, and ominous, impact would be to stop Congress from switching money from low-priority to high-priority programs. President Clinton's pledge to retilt spending toward long-term investments would be destroyed.
Representatives Charles Stenholm of Texas, Tim Penny of Minnesota and John Kasich of Ohio have proposed a number of harmful new rules. Among them is a proposal to alter the way Congress compares year-to-year changes in discretionary programs. Under current procedures, Congress compares future spending levels to current spending adjusted upward by inflation. That way Congress can instantly see if benefits under a program will expand or shrink. 
 But this procedure rankles conservatives because Congress can claim it is cutting a program even though it is adding money (though by less than inflation). The Congressmen want to compare future spending to current spending with no inflation adjustment. The proposal makes little sense. Responsible lawmakers need to know what would happen to services and benefits their constituents are used to receiving. The only purpose of the proposal is to make it easier for conservatives to bash "tax-and-spenders" even if they vote to raise spending only enough to keep pace with inflation.
The Congressmen propose a similar comparison for entitlements -- programs, like Social Security, that set spending by formula rather than annual appropriations. They would have Congress compare future spending to current levels without, for example, adjusting for increases in the number of eligible beneficiaries.
The Congressmen will bring to the floor an even worse gimmick, called a lock box, allowing members who propose spending cuts to specify that the savings be used only for deficit reduction. This is a dagger aimed at the President's economic program. He has proposed cutting hundreds of programs in part to free money for investment in infrastructure, education and training. The lock box would let members who propose the very same cuts siphon away the money for deficit reduction.
This week Mr. Stenholm and friends will also propose giving the President authority to force Congress to vote on any proposal he makes to rescind spending that Congress has already approved. The power to put individual programs up for vote would give the President an unprecedented weapon against recalcitrant members.
There is a misguided theme lurking behind every one of these benighted proposals: further deficit reduction is more important than anything else Congress can do with taxpayer money. This theme is ideology run amok. Deficit reduction is an important way to reduce public borrowing, thereby leaving more money in capital markets for private investors to borrow. But public investment -- in highways, mass transit, childhood education and worker training -- is also important for the economy's future. Congress ought not bury that good idea under the pretense of fiscal prudence.

HEADLINE: Simpson Case Tells America About Itself

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The O. J. Simpson fracas has been debated enough from the pulpit, in the media and at the nation's barbershops and beauty salons. America will just have to wait as the wheels of justice grind to their conclusion. But because nothing takes place in a political vacuum, consider the following: 
 First, the issue of racism. As a black American, O. J. Simpson wears one mantle; but as a person of influence, prestige and wealth, he wears another, which has dictated his treatment by just about everyone involved. A cabal of high-powered lawyers has beaten a path to his doorstep. Ordinary black men accused of murder would have long been lost in our judicial and penal system.
Color is but the external device we use to determine the differences between peoples. Slavery, Jim Crowism and racism in general existed and still do to a certain extent because of a need for an economic underclass. It is affluence, rather than skin color, that decides your place in America's social stratum. Color is only a marker, albeit a valid demographic one.
Then there is the issue of violence, which is on all our minds as we are continually exposed to mass murder from a school tower, carnage on a commuter railroad train, a revenge killing in a post office by a disgruntled employee, an almost daily drug-related assassination and Federal Bureau of Investigation raids on religious conclaves.
If the Oval Office and Congress can glibly carry out nighttime bombing raids on urban civilian populations and suggest intercontinental ballistic missile attacks on another nation's alleged nuclear factories as part of our foreign policy, why can't a citizen take up the gauntlet and use bloodshed as a means of communication?
Justice Louis Brandeis said it all in a 1928 paper: Our Government is the teacher. It teaches by example. Crime is contagious. If the government is a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law.

HEADLINE: The New Military Order

BYLINE: By Barry M. Blechman; Barry M. Blechman is chairman of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a non-profit research and educational organization.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As the House and Senate prepare to confer on the Defense Authorization bill, Democrats and Republicans have largely set aside their conflicts and are sticking with the spending target of $252 billion -- a cut of 4 percent, adjusting for inflation, from last year. But a growing number of lawmakers and military commanders are arguing that the planned cuts go too deep and could endanger military readiness.
By the end of the decade, defense outlays are projected to decline in real terms by more than one-third from the highs of the 1980's. No complex organization can be reduced so quickly without incurring problems. And, as troubles from Haiti to the former Soviet republics underscore, the world remains an uncertain place. 
 The U.S. military should move gradually to adapt to the new world order. But when we peer into the next decade, can we see a way to reduce defense spending without risk to national security? The answer is yes, but not by further reducing the size of the military. The real promise of savings lies in simply making the armed forces more efficient.
Technology is transforming the U.S. economy. Corporations are increasingly taking advantage of emerging technologies to improve their product lines, slash payrolls and adopt cost-saving procedures. Military technology is also changing radically, and the Defense Department is taking advantage of it by improving its product lines. But unlike American corporations, the military has been slow to reorganize; the challenge facing Defense Secretary William Perry is to accelerate the reform.
Two kinds of reform in particular need bipartisan support from Congress. First, the U.S. needs to change the way it buys military equipment. The complicated process through which we develop and purchase weapons and equipment includes perverse incentives that drive up costs. Mr. Perry knows very well what needs to be done, having had hands-on experience in the defense industry, and he has begun to make concrete improvements, like issuing an executive order last month mandating wide-ranging changes in the Defense Department's business practices.
One reform he is advocating is especially promising: eliminating special military requirements, making it possible to purchase equipment more cheaply. Military commanders need not shop at their local Wal-Mart, but hundreds of thousands of weapon components could be purchased more cheaply if the military accepted commercial standards of performance. These standards are quite stringent, particularly in the highly competitive field of electronics. Yet military specifications, even ordinary pieces of equipment, often run dozens of pages and demand absurd levels of performance that drive costs sky-high.
The shift to commercial standards will also mean that our armed forces could expand more quickly in an emergency. The fewer military requirements there are, the easier it would be for the Pentagon to piggyback on commercial industries.
No one knows exactly how much money could be saved eventually through this and other procurement reforms, but Mr. Perry has estimated that they could reap $5 billion to $10 billion a year beginning in 1999. Last year, the Defense Science Board, which advises the Pentagon on technological issues, put the figure at $20 billion. Certainly, the high end of Mr. Perry's range is a reasonable target.
Another area that needs significant improvement: how the military uses its personnel. We must do more to reduce duplication in the support staffs of the armed services, a move singled out by Gen. Colin L. Powell Jr., the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in his 1993 report on the services' roles and missions.
Because the Army, the Navy and the Air Force have each historically tried to remain as autonomous as possible, they often replicate one another in such areas as training of electronics technicians, providing medical care and maintaining vehicles and aircraft. If a single service could be named executive agent for each of these functions, fewer people would have to be kept in uniform to support combat-ready troops. And eliminating duplication also would mean fewer civilians working for the Defense Department and fewer military bases.
A second way to reduce personnel would be to review the way that manpower requirements are calculated. Before Richard Nixon abolished the draft in 1972, it was cheap to hire servicemen and women. Now personnel are paid competitive wages, but they continue to be used inefficiently as if they were still inexpensive.
Congress should undertake a comparison of military schools, hospitals, supply centers, administrative headquarters and repair depots with their civilian counterparts to assess how serious the problem is. American corporations have found their greatest savings by streamlining middle management; this would be a good place for the armed services to look as well.
If the Pentagon reduced its civilian work force and uniformed personnel assigned to supporting roles by 20 percent -- in line with the cuts now being made by many U.S. companies -- annual savings could reach $12 billion over the next decade.
Adding these savings to those from procurement reform would bring the Defense Department budget down from the $230 billion (in today's dollars) planned for fiscal 1999 to below $210 billion. These cuts would be made without reducing the size of the combat forces, risking their technological edge or compromising their readiness.
Of course, it is a great deal easier to theorize about these potential savings than to pocket them. The Defense Secretary must initiate the changes and his staff must follow up aggressively, but only the services can take action on the thousands of individual steps that are required to nail down the cost reductions.
Twenty years ago, as the nation's armed forces wound down after the Vietnam War, then Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger offered the services additional combat units if they were able to make deeper reductions. This kind of creative management is worth another look as the services recover from the cold war.

Dell Computer to Abandon Retail Store Sales

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
Seeking to play to its strengths, the Dell Computer Corporation said yesterday that it would stop selling computers in stores and concentrate instead on direct sales to consumers.
The move is expected to have little overall impact on Dell. The company has already pared its retail business to roughly 2 percent of its annual sales of $3.5 billion, and the operation is not profitable, Michael S. Dell, chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. 
 And Dell computers will still be readily available, he said, adding, "There are 180 million telephones in the United States, and anyone can reach us."
The main reason for eliminating retail sales is to reduce costs and pricing risk, Mr. Dell said. Conventional retailing is too slow for a product like computers, which have a short shelf life, he said.
 
Intel Lowers Chip Prices
 "Intel just announced that prices of chips are going down," he said. "If you've got chips sitting on the shelf from 30 days ago, or if the manufacturer has 70 days of inventory, you can't respond as quickly to changes," he said. With no inventory in warehouses, Dell can adjust prices faster, he said.
Dell ranks sixth in personal computer sales in the United States, behind Gateway 2000, which also specializes in direct sales. A year ago it was ahead of Gateway, according to Richard Zwetchkenbaum, of the International Data Group, a consulting firm in Framingham, Mass. The leaders, Compaq Computer, Packard Bell, Apple Computer and I.B.M., all sell their machines primarily in stores.
Mr. Zwetchkenbaum and other analysts said that at least in the short term Dell's move was probably a good one, but that the company would forsake some brand identity, and thus, some future sales.
"In some respects it is a good solution for Dell," he said. "They were out of their league, in a sense," he said, adding that direct-channel sales are Dell's strong point.
But in the long term, he said, not having retail sales means not having a strong brand image, and closing off some potential buyers. About 35 percent of households in this country have a personal computer, Mr. Zwetchkenbaum said, but the others, "the great unwashed," will not buy their first machine by calling an "800" number, he said.
"The novice and the first-time buyer generally are going to want to touch and feel," he said. "They want the in-store experience. They want to hear the multimedia, with different speakers, see the different sized monitors and graphics resolutions, and talk to somebody interactively, and bring the kids along with them on the second trip."
Fred Gardner, the hardware editor of Computer Reseller News, a weekly in Manhasset, L.I., said: "They'll be getting more experienced customers, but maybe that's what they want. It's a lot less trouble for them."
Wall Street seemed to favor the move. Dell's shares gained 81.25 cents yesterday to close at $28.875 in Nasdaq trading.
Dell and other direct-sales companies offer what Dell calls "mass customization," which means letting the buyer mix-and-match components, like the central processor, the size of the storage disk, the amount of working memory and the software installed. Experienced computer users usually have detailed preferences.
 
Sales to Resellers
 The company will continue to sell personal computers to "value added resellers," or companies that install additional hardware into the computers, or link them together into networks with special software, and then resell them as packages to client companies. Mr. Dell said yesterday that such sales accounted for less than 10 percent of his volume.
At BIS Strategic Decisions, a market research and consulting firm in Norwood, Mass., Raymond L. Boggs, a personal computer analyst, said, "It's certainly not the doom of retailing, but it underscores how difficult it is to build a retail franchise and make money at the same time."
Making money in retailing is hard because margins are thin, he said, 15 to 20 percent at computer stores and as little as 7 to 9 percent at warehouse stores. One reason markups are so small, he said, is that Dell and others are putting pressure on prices by direct sales.
Computer companies have had varied experiences with direct sales. Apple gave them up last year, Mr. Zwetchkenbaum said. I.B.M., on the other hand, is now emphasizing direct sales.

HEADLINE: Dollar Falls Sharply Vs. Mark

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
The dollar posted one of its largest one-day drops today against the German mark and edged down to another low against the Japanese yen, as the Clinton Administration took no substantive steps to brake the dollar's monthlong fall and after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged.
Without action by the Federal Reserve, traders and Wall Street economists predicted, the dollar could fall much further. "The dollar can go down wherever the markets want, and frankly it can go down anywhere," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. "I wouldn't even try to foresee where the dollar will be in a week or two." 
 The dollar plummeted to 1.5280 German marks in New York trading today, from 1.5617 marks on Friday, after being as low as 1.5202 marks during the day.
 
Tough Day All Around
 It also touched another post-World War II low of 96.96 yen before edging back to 97.73 yen, its previous low, down from 98.10 on Friday. The dollar fell, too, against the Canadian dollar, British pound and some other European currencies.
Stock and bond markets were down as the dollar's drop was taken as a lack of international interest in holding dollar-denominated assets.
President Clinton said in Bonn today that the lack of American action should not be interpreted as an effort to make American goods cheaper and more salable in foreign markets. "We will not use the dollar as an instrument of trade," he said. "We take this issue seriously."
 
A Loud Silence
 But the President said nothing about whether interest rates should be raised to protect the currency, nor did he signal any further interventions in currency markets to prop up the dollar.
By saying nothing about interest rates, Mr. Clinton left in place Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's comment in Naples on Friday that he saw no need for the Federal Reserve to raise rates "at this point." Many traders contend that the dollar is unlikely to stop dropping soon without higher rates to make American bonds more attractive to international investors.
Mr. Bentsen's remarks Friday were made after Mr. Clinton had set off a plunge in the dollar earlier in the day by saying he opposed quick action to help the currency. He said the dollar would rebound on its own, once investors realized the American economy's fundamental strength.
Treasury Department officials in Naples also raised the possibility that central banks might eventually intervene on the dollar's behalf. But central banks around the world have had little success lately in propping up the dollar by selling billions of marks and yen in exchange for dollars.
The Federal Reserve is independent of the executive branch and has defied Administrations over the years by raising interest rates to fight inflation. But the central bank has tended to respect the wishes of recent Administrations when it came to dollar policy.
Fed officials have long avoided citing the dollar as the sole reason for rate increases, preferring instead to mention the dollar as one of many reasons.
Yet top Fed officials are known to be reluctant to defy the Administration now, given contradictory evidence about whether the domestic economy is growing fast enough to feed inflation.
"It's my feeling that they'll want to wait until they can point to a domestic reason" for any further short-term interest rate increases, said Robert D. Hormats, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, who has been an economic-affairs official in the Reagan and Carter Administrations.
The central bank might find such reasons later this week. The Labor Department is scheduled to release figures on Tuesday for producer prices in June, and on Wednesday for consumer prices, and some economists expect these figures to show slightly higher inflation.
 
Fear of Too Much Demand
 Commerce Department figures on Thursday for retail sales in June and the Federal Reserve's figures Friday for industrial production would provide further ammunition for another interest-rate increase if they show that the economy is growing so quickly that companies may start to bid up the prices of scarce materials and the wages of workers with sought-after skills.
Last Friday the Labor Department reported a surge in jobs. But other recent economic indicators, like new home sales and orders for factory equipment, have suggested a slowing of economic growth.
The Federal Reserve does not focus only on the dollar's relationship against the yen and the mark. When the central bank's board meets every Monday morning to review interest rates, its members look at an index of the dollar's value in terms of 10 other currencies. The index is weighted by the volume of American trade with the countries issuing each of these currencies.
The overall index dropped only slightly last week, to 89.06 from 89.98, as the American dollar's strength against the Canadian dollar and the pound offset weakness against the yen and the mark, according to Federal Reserve figures released today.
But the dollar was weak across the board today, pushing the British pound up sharply to $1.5720 in late New York trading, from $1.5500 on Friday.
It fell to 5.2545 French francs from 5.3700 francs, and weakened to 1.2905 Swiss francs, a 20-month low, from 1.3175. It also tumbled to 1,524 Italian lire from 1,555. The Canadian dollar rose to 72.13 United States cents from 71.96 cents.
Fed officials have been impressed that the overall index had virtually the same average in June as in June 1993. This suggests that while importers of German cars or Japanese cameras may be raising their prices soon because of currency-market fluctuations, importers of Canadian pork or British antique furniture might not do so, with little if any overall effect on inflation.
Some Federal Reserve officials and Wall Street economists worry that the United States depends heavily on Japan for investment capital. They fear a lack of demand for American corporate and Treasury bonds, and higher long-term interest rates as a result, if Japanese investors stop putting up money for fear of exchange-rate losses.
Mr. Hormats said the Fed might also be reluctant to set a precedent for propping up the dollar with interest-rate increases, noting that Britain had raised rates several percentage points in stages two years ago in an unsuccessful effort to bolster the pound.
The Fed operates by controlling the overnight interest rates at which commercial banks borrow money from each other or from it. By raising these overnight rates, the Fed induces commercial banks to cut back on lending, which can prevent the economy from overheating.
Higher short-term rates tend to push up long-term rates for a while, but eventually hold down long-term rates as investors conclude that inflation is less likely to erode their returns from long-term investments.

Dollar Drops in Tokyo
 TOKYO, Tuesday, July 12 (By Bloomberg business News) -- The dollar continued to drop against the yen, though less steeply, in Tokyo trading today.
In afternoon trading, the dollar fell to 97.38 yen, compared with 97.73 late Monday in New York.
Stock prices were lower in sluggish trading. The yen's strength against the dollar was discouraging buying, traders said. An hour before the close of the market, the Nikkei index of 225 leading issues was down 81.51 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, at 20,391.58. On Monday, the Nikkei fell 53.42 points.
The dollar also continued to slip against the German mark. The dollar was quoted at 1.5274 marks this afternoon, off slightly from 1.5280 marks in New York on Monday.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE DOCTORS;
Doctors Are Sparring With Insurers Over Right to Join Health Networks

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
In a battle that will profoundly shape the way American medical care is delivered, doctors across the country are pressing for state and Federal laws to make it harder for insurance companies and health maintenance organizations to exclude doctors from health care networks.
These managed-care networks generally have lists of doctors who agree to work for discounted fees; patients must choose from among these doctors to receive insurance reimbursement. 
 As more Americans sign up with networks or H.M.O.'s in the search for lower medical costs, doctors who are not aligned with the plans lose patients.
Insurers say legislation to forcibly broaden doctor enrollment threatens to eviscerate H.M.O.'s and discount medical networks, which now provide coverage for at least 90 million Americans. The insurers say they need to limit the number of doctors to keep administrative costs down and maintain standards of care, even if it means rejecting qualified doctors.
But the doctors, thousands of whom have tried to join such networks over the last year only to be excluded because insurers have all the doctors they need, say they are unfairly being shut out.
Joseph White, a researcher at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the conflict was over raw economic power. "The forms of managed care that work at all do so by holding some hammer over the doctors," he said. "The ability to exclude people is fundamental in those systems."
Doctors also assert that patients are being deprived of access to longtime family practitioners who can be relied on to place health concerns ahead of economics.
Charlene Culpepper, a telephone service representative for Southwestern Bell in Houston, is one patient upset about having to change her doctor. She said her longstanding physician, Dr. Robert Maidenberg, was dropped from her health plan when her employer switched from the Prudential Insurance Company to another insurer last year.
 
'I Don't Feel Comfortable'
 Dr. Maidenberg "saved my life" when he identified what she said was a "precancerous tumor" that was then removed from her right kidney. "Now I have to go to another doctor," she said. "I don't feel comfortable with him. I feel I wouldn't get as good care."
Eight states have enacted doctor-sponsored measures, called "any willing provider" bills, and legislative committees in at least eight more, including New York and New Jersey, are considering similar proposals. Five states defeated such proposals this year.
Dick Hegner, a senior research associate of the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project at George Washington University, said, "The issue forces legislators onto a battlefield of basic American values, where providers' freedom to contract conflicts with insurers' free-enterprise rights."
Independent pharmacists have also been scoring lobbying victories. Laws in 15 states make it difficult for managed-care networks to exclude any pharmacy.
 
Insurers Look to Congress
 Critics in the insurance industry hope the state laws will be killed by Congress. That could happen under pre-empting provisions of the health care bills recently approved in the Senate by the Finance Committee and by the Labor and Human Resources Committee and in the House by the Education and Labor Committee.
But Congressional aides said that support for the pre-emption was precarious. They said it only made it into the Finance Committee's bill after the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, who opposed the measure, changed his vote to break a 10-to-10 tie that was threatening to block action on the entire bill.
Moreover, the insurance industry is further concerned because the bills endorsed by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and by the House Ways and Means Committee include any-willing-provider provisions.
If Congress fails to pass sweeping changes in the way Americans receive health care this year, the growing number of state laws will command the field and may determine the future of health care financing. State legislators do not necessarily welcome that prospect, and governors in a number of states, including California, Colorado, Florida and Minnesota have threatened to veto the legislation.
 
Patients' Right to Choose
 The state laws "compel insurers to admit to their networks any provider" of health care who is "willing to abide by the terms and conditions of the contract," according to a survey by the Washington office of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, which strongly opposes such measures.
Spokesmen for doctors groups emphasize the patients' right to choose. The executive vice president of the American Medical Association, Dr. James S. Todd, said, "What we are trying to do is preserve the ability of physicians to care for patients who want to go to those physicians."
Insurance executives concede that the doctors' tactics have been effective. "We are on the defensive, trying to explain that we are not anti-choice," said Barbara Hill, vice president for health care policy at Prudential. "We prefer to call it a debate over quality and standards."
Karen Ignagni, president of the Group Health Association of America, a trade group of health maintenance organizations, said the willing-provider measures "gut the essence of what H.M.O.'s do: determine the complement of physicians, hospitals and other health care practitioners that best meet the needs of members."
Many employers, who pay for a large share of the country's health insurance and are increasingly turning to managed care to curb costs, also oppose the doctors' legislative efforts. In a letter on May 16 to members of Congress, 60 large employers and business coalitions called for rejection of proposals that would force health plans to contract with any willing provider and with teaching hospitals, in particular.
Helen Darling, manager of health care strategy for the Xerox Corporation, said, "The advantages we might get in being more selective, both in quality and cost, go away" if employers have to accept unwanted doctors.
Many doctors are furious at insurers like Blue Cross and Blue Shield of the National Capital Area, which left out a third of the 8,000 doctors in its other health plans when it started a new network in the Washington, D.C., area last year. It covers 485,000 Federal employees and their families, including a third of the members of Congress and their staffs.
"My patients say to me, 'Why do we have to pay more money to see you, when you're willing to participate and they won't let you in?' " said Dr. Mark Whitten, a Washington ophthalmologist. He is chairman of the District of Columbia Medical Society, which is seeking a court order to force Blue Cross to let doctors who were excluded join the network.
Indeed, doctors and hospitals are challenging managed-care exclusions in a number of lawsuits across the country. In Houston, doctors dismissed from managed-care networks have sued divisions of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company and Prudential in a case that is still unresolved.
 
Exclusions Questioned
 As it stands now, there is a patchwork of rules and laws that vary by the places where patients live and doctors practice. In Washington, for example, doctors contend that the new Blue Cross network violates a willing-provider law in Virginia, where Dr. Whitten also practices. The District of Columbia City Council recently heard testimony on a proposal similar to Virginia's law. And Maryland was one of the states that rejected a doctor-supported bill earlier this year.
The Washington doctors also said Blue Cross had discriminated against doctors who served low-income neighborhoods, where patients more often delayed seeking care until they were seriously ill and needed expensive treatment.
Dr. Robert Blythe, a Washington urologist who was not taken into the network, said his practice had been hurt at his office next to Southeast Community Hospital, which serves many low-income, minority patients. He said the new network had excluded a disproportionate number of doctors in that part of town, leaving fewer family doctors on the list who would refer patients to specialists like him.
Barbara Exstrum, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of the National Capital Area, said invitations to join the network were partly based on a computer system "that allows us to compare the resources that different physicians used in treating the same degree of illness." She said the comparisons were adjusted to reflect differences in the severity of the illness treated, and she disputed the accusation that the new network discriminated against doctors who treat the sickest patients.
The insurers and H.M.O.'s say the outcome of the battle will affect their costs, which may be passed along to members of their health plans. Profits may also be affected, said Ira S. Loss, a Washington health care analyst with Natwest Securities Corporation. He is not sanguine about the chances of defeating the willing-provider legislation in Congress because, he said, "There are more doctors and pharmacists and patients than there are H.M.O.'s."

HEADLINE: Auto Finance Charges Jumped in Spring

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 11

 BODY:
Finance charges for buying new cars and trucks spiked upward this spring at a pace not seen since 1988, a Labor Department economist said today.
After declining steadily for three years, the charges moved up in April, after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. 
 "You had the biggest increase in finance charges that we've had in quite a few years," said Patrick C. Jackman, a senior economist at the Labor Department who tracks consumer price data. "It's pretty obvious that in June they'll be up, too."
 
 
Index Up 6% in 2 Months
 The department's index of finance charges jumped 2.3 percent in April and another 3.7 percent in May, he said.
Because of special incentives and other marketing ploys, actual finance charges to customers vary widely, and Mr. Jackman said he had no average figures.
Finance charges have a direct impact on prices of new vehicles, since the higher the interest rate on a car loan the more a buyer has to pay each month. Despite the rising interest rates, however, new vehicle sales were healthy in June, posting a 6.8 percent increase over strong sales a year earlier.
Dealers said finance charges had not risen enough to begin scaring away buyers. At the Thomason Auto Group in Milwaukie, Ore., for example, finance rates have climbed to 7.75 percent, from 7.25 percent, in the last three months, said J. A. Justice, the finance manager. On a $15,000 car, Mr. Justice said, that change raised the monthly payment by less than $4 a month, to $303.92 from $300 on a five-year loan with no money down.
"People aren't going to balk over $3 or $4," he said. "Once you start getting up over 10 percent, people start thinking twice about it."
Mr. Jackman said he could not predict whether rising finance charges would depress sales. "It really depends on how the growth in the economy continues," he said. Robust growth and strong consumer confidence could offset the effects of finance rate increases.
While rising interest rates might not restrain total vehicle sales, they could convince consumers to lower their sights, settling for a cheaper new vehicle with fewer options than they would otherwise have bought. Sales of such cars and trucks are less profitable for the auto makers, since the markups on options like compact disk players are higher than the markup of the basic car. Further, some buyers may elect to purchase a used car, rather than a new one.
One worry for some Wall Street analysts has been that consumers would begin to pre-buy -- that is, to purchase vehicles sooner than they had planned in hopes of locking in lower rates. Such behavior could cause the auto cycle to peak sooner than 1996 or 1997, as most analysts have projected.
Rising rates do appear to be motivating some buyers. "People are coming in and saying, 'I might want to think about getting a car,' " said Liz Scanlan, business manager at Koons Ford in Baltimore. "They want to beat the rates."
Ms. Scanlan came to the same conclusion herself. "I was looking in March and thought, 'I'll just hang on,' " she said. "But then the rates went up." Ms. Scanlan bought a used car, a 1992 Volkswagen Cabriolet.

HEADLINE: Most Cities Raising Taxes and Fees, Survey Finds

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Despite an improving economy, most American cities and towns are raising taxes and fees or reducing spending this year to keep their budgets in the black.
The National League of Cities said its annual survey of 551 municipalities showed that 70 percent planned to increase taxes or fees and 63 percent expected to reduce spending. 
 One in four cities and towns increased property tax rates during the past year, the survey found. The cities with the most such increases were in the Northeast, where nearly 50 percent of the municipalities raised property taxes, followed by the Midwest, with 31 percent; the South with 28 percent, and the West with less than 8 percent.
And half increased user fees and charges while 25 percent added new ones. There was little variation in cities of different size or in different regions, the league said.
The league said 1994 would be the second successive year that a majority of municipal budgets ended in the black after three years of widespread fiscal problems during the recession and early recovery.
The survey found 54 percent of the municipalities expecting to take in more in taxes and other income than they spend for services. That would be down from two-thirds in 1993.
"The signs of a turnaround are encouraging," said Donald J. Borut, the league's executive director, "but caution signals are still flashing."
Health care costs for city employees, spending required by Federal or state governments and infrastructure needs were the biggest problems for local budgets, the league found.
Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, the league president, said the cost of health care for municipal employees grew by 250 percent from 1980 to 1994 and was cited by 42 percent of the cities as a problem.
"Local government is labor-intensive," Mr. James said. "It's where the work gets done, and that's what makes this such a big factor in local budgets."
The league also found that 38 percent of the respondents complained about spending required by Federal and state governments.
"If something is important enough to require a state or Federal mandate, we should have a voice in deciding how to do it," Mr. James said. "And if it's important enough to require a mandate, it should be important enough to have state or Federal funding to help carry out the mandates."

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 11

 BODY:
Long after the muddy waters go down in Albany, after the stench of human waste and 300,000 dead chickens disappears from Montezuma, after workers start repairing 1,700 roads, 600 bridges and 100 dams damaged by last week's flooding, the Southeast's answer to last year's Midwestern flooding will continue to haunt this battered state.
The waters were still rising today in the southwest corner of Georgia, and officials in Bainbridge worked to move residents out of danger as they awaited the Flint River's record crest later this week. But from Atlanta south, the area battered by the rains brought by Tropical Storm Alberto, residents and officials were beginning to ponder the long-term effects of the worst flooding in Georgia history. 
 The death toll is already heavy: 28 killed since the rain began a week ago, compared with 48 deaths attributed to the summerlong flood in the Middle West last year. And, as residents of the Middle West learned, the damage in terms of economics, environment and emotions is also certain to be severe.
Worries include industries likely to be crippled for months, freight rail lines shut down by washed-out bridges that could take months to repair and up to 1,300 hazardous-chemical sites that are in the flooded area and have the potential to cause significant environmental problems.
"You know, I would like to be optimistic and say we'll get over this by spring," said Mayor Tommy Olmstead of Macon, "but that's not the case. This is going to have years of effects on us. We have never had a disaster like this in Macon."
 
Immediate Concerns
 In the areas still inundated or where water was still rising, the present, not the future, was the main concern today. In Albany, the Flint River, which drove a quarter of the city's 80,000 residents from their homes, finally crested today, two days later than officials had expected.
Downstream, the small town of Newton was almost completely inundated. Still waiting for the worst is Bainbridge, a community of 10,000 that is the last major town in the Flint's path. The river there is expected to crest Wednesday at 48 feet, 3 feet higher than had been expected earlier and a record 23 feet above flood level.
At the Vigoro Industries fertilizer plant in Bainbridge, the National Guard worked to build a 10-foot dike around a 200-foot tank that holds 9 million pounds of toxic ammonia. If the plant was to flood, toxic gas could be released. Officials said they were confident the dike would hold off the water but were prepared to evacuate remaining residents if it did not.
In much of the state, people were beginning to dry out and get their first vivid glimpses of how long-lived the effects of the flooding will be. Officials at the Georgia Emergency Management Agency command post in Atlanta got help from someone well-versed in flooding: Ellen Gordon, director of the Iowa Emergency Management Agency.
"From what I can see, Georgia looks a lot like Iowa did last year," she said.
 
After the Water Goes
 In Montezuma, a town of 4,500 about 110 miles south of Atlanta, much of the water that flooded the downtown last week was gone today. But officials said they did not know how long it would be before the town was habitable.
"One of the farmers in our county lost 17 houses and 300,000 chickens," said Joyce Middlebrooks, the city clerk. "You can't get within a mile of it because of the smell. They're having to get all this gear to go in there and remove those chickens. It's a disease problem, too. We have a biohazard downtown from all the water and two gasoline tanks that popped right out of the ground, with gas spewing everywhere. It's an environmental disaster here."
Even when the town is livable, residents must cope with the loss of the town's biggest employer, the Southern Frozen Foods factory, which had employed 550 people full time and an additional 150 during the summer.
"There are bridges that have to be replaced, there are streets that have eroded; these are long-term things," Ms. Middlebrooks said. "You won't have any trouble finding us. Just follow your nose."
 
Restoring the Rails
 Among the biggest worries is disruption of rail service, the main avenue for many industries and farmers to get their products to market.
Not all the news is bad. CSX Transportation, which operates 1,700 route miles of track in Georgia, said it had already repaired the damage that caused it to reroute 170 trains around the flooded area last week.
But for smaller freight lines, like the Georgia Southwestern Railroad, which covers 300 miles from Columbus to Bainbridge, the problems could linger for months.
Jim Davis, general manger for the company, which handles 17,000 carloads a year for farmers, paper mills and manufacturers, said that in the area near Americus three bridges had washed away, as had track beds as long as 200 feet. Some of the damage could take as long as two months to repair, he said.
If roads are repaired promptly, some of the freight traffic can be handled by trucks, Mr. Davis said. Timing is particularly critical for farmers and grain elevators.
"But you can't do that in all cases," Mr. Davis said. "It's really going to put some of them in a critical situation."
 
Hope and Pessimism
 In some places, there was optimism that the damage would not be crippling.
"To me it was amazing, in 24 hours, how much people got done," said John Cary Pittick, sheriff of Monroe County, where the tourist town of Juliette, largely underwater last week, was drying out today. "I really believe everything is going to wind up opened back up just like it was in just a few days."
But in harder-hit cities, and in bigger ones like Macon and Albany, there was far less confidence.
"Our Public Works Department was completely covered," said Ms. Middlebrooks, Montezuma's city clerk. "We had 17 pieces of heavy equipment, and we lost all but six."
In Macon, where it is expected to be a week before water service is restored, Mayor Olmstead fears the flooding will batter the summer tourism business and hurt small businesses for years. "I was a small businessman myself, and I know when you have a major loss, it takes years for you to get back up to financial strength," he said.
Another worry is environmental damage. Bert Langley, emergency response coordinator for the state's Environmental Protection Agency, said the flooded area included more than 1,300 locations, half of them service stations, storing about 10,000 pounds each of gasoline and other hazardous materials. But Ms. Gordon said Midwestern officials found last year that so much water was diluting the chemicals that little damage was apparent.

HEADLINE: Mayor Agrees To 2 Advisers On Bond Sales

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Settling for now a major dispute with the city's Comptroller, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that the city would retain two financial advisers for its forthcoming bond sales, including the black-owned company that the Giuliani administration sought to remove as a cost-cutting measure.
By backing down on its demand that only one company be hired, the administration can go forward with two important bond sales that are estimated to provide $225 million that the Mayor has counted on to close the budget gap and to help improve the city's cash flow. 
 As described by the Mayor and Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, the agreement means that each side will have one company advising it during the bond sales over the next three months. The two sides agreed to evaluate the issue again after that.
The administration had originally sought to use only one financial adviser to help it select underwriters for the bond sales, saying that the system of using two firms, which former Mayor David N. Dinkins had instituted, was too costly. But Mr. Hevesi insisted that the city's bond business was so large that the expertise of two firms was needed.
 
Racial Overtones to Dispute
 Although both sides had agreed to retain one of the firms the city has used, Public Resources Advisory Group of New York, Mr. Hevesi wanted also wanted to retain P. G. Corbin & Company of Philadelphia, which is owned by a black woman.
Two weeks ago the dispute took on racial overtones when Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson suggested that racial preference had been the basis of Mr. Hevesi's desire to retain P. G. Corbin.
The issue became more highly charged when Mr. Dyson, disputing Mr. Hevesi's contention that the cost would be the same whether the city used one financial adviser or two, said that Mr. Hevesi "ought to know the difference between a bid and a watermelon."
That comment drew the wrath of several elected officials, some of whom called on Mr. Dyson to resign. Mr. Dyson later apologized for his remarks, saying that he did not mean them as a racial slur.
Despite yesterday's agreement, there was apparently some tension, as the two sides disagreed sharply on how the firms would be paid. During a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Hevesi, with Mr. Giuliani at his side, said the two companies would be paid separately: the Corbin firm would be paid out of Mr. Hevesi's budget, while Public Resources would be paid out of the Mayor's budget.
But later in the day, Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers called reporters to say that Public Resources would be paid from the proceeds of the bond sales and that P.G. Corbin would be paid out of the Comptroller's budget.
Public Resources, he said, "was the company the Mayor selected as financial adviser and they will be paid from the proceeds of the bond sales."
Jack Chartier, the Deputy Comptroller for intergovernmental affairs, said that arrangement contradicted the agreement reached between the two officials on Sunday night. He said that the two sides had agreed to pay the companies out of their respective budgets.
"Now we're being told by the press that they are being paid by the bond proceeds," Mr. Chartier said. "If P.R.A.G. is going to be paid by the bond proceeds, then Corbin will be paid by the bond proceeds, too."
 
Seeking Long-Term Solution
 Speaking to reporters earlier, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Hevesi said that the three-month period would enable them to resolve the issue entirely. "We're very hopeful that, with our staffs working together, we can come to a long-term resolution," the Mayor said. "Sometimes, after people work together, they can figure out long-term solutions that early on they can't figure out."
Mr. Hevesi said that the two companies, which have been acting as advisers for the city since 1990, would continue to work together. Mr. Hevesi said that, under the arrangement, the two companies would be paid at the same rate as they were in the last fiscal year, an annual amount of $770,000, to be split between the two.
The Mayor has steadfastly maintained that hiring a second company would cost the city at least $400,000 more a year. Mr. Hevesi countered that hiring two companies was no more costly than hiring one.
A financial adviser manages and advises the entire debt-management program for the city, helping to select underwriters and to insure that the city gets the most value for the dollars it spends.
The Mayor and the Comptroller spoke with reporters after a meeting of the State Financial Control Board at which Mr. Giuliani received a sobering assessment of the city's fiscal condition. Several members of the state monitoring body, including Mr. Hevesi, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the board, criticized Mr. Giuliani's budget plan, saying it relied heavily on revenues that were uncertain.
"The city faces more than $1 billion in current-year budget risk," Mr. Proctor said. "The possibility of enactment of increased city pension benefits by the State Legislature is another significant risk. This much risk, this early in the year is unprecedented and very worrisome."
To address those risks, Mr. Giuliani said that he would cut spending by $100 million in the first three months of the fiscal year -- a period ending Oct. 1. Holding back those funds would raise the city's financial reserve to a total of $250 million, the Mayor said.
"I will ask my commissioners to go through their agencies with a fine-tooth comb," Mr. Giuliani said. He added that he had asked all of the city's departments to decrease their spending by 2 to 2.5 percent -- including the Police Department, which had been largely spared from cuts under the Mayor's budget plan. "This is a holdback in spending," Mr. Giuliani said. "If things work out and we don't have to face these risks or the economy improves by the second quarter or third quarter we can reverse it."

HEADLINE: Israeli-Palestinian Talks Start

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Egypt, July 11

 BODY:
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators began talks today in Cairo on expanding Palestinian autonomy in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and settling outstanding security issues in the self-rule areas.
The talks marked a new phase in the Middle East peace effort. They opened as Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, landed in Cairo after leaving Tunisia, home to the P.L.O. for the last 12 years. On Tuesday, he will travel to his new home in the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho. 
 The two sides began the first detailed negotiations on "early empowerment," the formal term for widening Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank beyond the town of Jericho. Dr. Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the talks would focus on giving Palestinians responsibility for education, tourism, health and economic and social affairs in the West Bank beyond Jericho.
The negotiators will not grapple with the issue of elections for a Palestinian council until the early empowerment issues are resolved, Dr. Shaath said. But he predicted the talks could be concluded quickly.
The Palestinian council will be charged with governing the West Bank and Gaza Strip for an interim period of five years, during which Israel and the P.L.O. will negotiate a permanent settlement.
A separate team of negotiators returned to the table to settle issues left over from the self-rule agreement that was signed by Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel on May 4, includingthe boundaries of Palestinian self-rule in the Jericho area.

HEADLINE: Facing Limit on Spending, House Reduces Clinton's Requests

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Squeezed by the rigid spending ceilings that were enacted last year to lower the budget deficit, the House of Representatives has approved only a fraction of the new money President Clinton sought this year for his main domestic initiatives.
In the appropriations bills it passed last month, the House voted, for example, to give the President only 30 percent of the increase he wanted for Head Start, only half the increase he requested for the main Federal education program for poor children and less than half of the additional money he wanted for his national service program. 
 Administration officials said they hoped that more of the extra money for what Mr. Clinton calls investments would be approved when the Senate this month takes up the appropriations bills for the fiscal year 1995, which begins Oct. 1. But the officials conceded that any improvements would be slight.
The House did about as well as could be expected, said Leon E. Panetta, the budget director and the new White House chief of staff, given "the very difficult circumstances including the freeze on discretionary spending."
 
Appropriations Process
 Barry J. Toiv, the chief spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, calculated that the House approved about 60 percent of the $14 billion in investment priorities the President proposed in his budget last winter. Mr. Clinton uses the term "investment" to describe any domestic program for which he wants an increase in spending.
About one-third of the Federal budget is controlled by the appropriations process. It involves what is known as discretionary spending, money that Congress allots every year for items ranging from air conditioners to aircraft carriers, from parks to paper clips.
Half of the $1.5 trillion Federal budget goes to entitlement programs, in which money is automatically allocated to everyone who meets the qualifications. Nearly 85 percent of the entitlement money is spent for Social Security, pensions for Federal workers, Medicare and Medicaid. The rest of the Federal budget is spent for interest payments on the national debt.
The deficit-reduction legislation that Congress approved and Mr. Clinton signed last year specifies that spending on discretionary programs will remain steady at $540 billion to $550 billion a year through the fiscal year 1998. In fact, discretionary spending will drop in the next fiscal year to $541 billion from $547 billion this year, the first time there has been a decrease from one year to the next since President Lyndon B. Johnson's last budget.
 
Cuts and Other Cuts
 That means that too little money exists for programs even to keep pace with inflation. So every additional penny that Mr. Clinton wants for one of his investments like Head Start, the preschool program for poor children, must be offset by cuts in other discretionary programs. Almost all the other discretionary programs, like air traffic control and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are considered essential or, like the space station and Amtrak, have strong political constituencies.
For several years, the problem was eased somewhat because money was taken from the military to finance domestic programs. But Mr. Clinton and most lawmakers now believe that the Pentagon budget cannot safely be shrunk much more. "We must not cut defense further," the President said in his State of the Union Message.
So Mr. Clinton had to look elsewhere for money to pay for his investments, and the House was not always willing to go along.
He asked for a $745 million cut in the program giving assistance for home heating to the elderly poor. The House approved a reduction of only $250 million.
He wanted to cut several public housing programs by $1.3 billion, and the House voted a $300 million increase.
He wanted to reduce operating subsidies for local mass transit systems by $202 million. The House approved a cut of only $102 million.
 
Crime-Control MoneyFunds
 Crime control was one area where the House gave the President most of what he wanted. The House approved more than three-quarters of the $1.7 million in new financing Mr. Clinton sought for community policing and almost all of the $300 million he requested for border security.
But even in the case of crime-fighting, Mr. Clinton was denied. The House did not approve any of the $100 million he wanted to enforce the law enacted last year setting a five-day waiting period before a handgun can be bought to give the police time to check the buyer's background. The House also approved only one-fifth of the $257 million increase in spending the President wanted for drug treatment.
The President and Congress are not willing to commit nearly as much money to fight crime as it might appear when they are considering legislation like the anti-crime bill now before a House-Senate conference committee. The bill passed by the Senate last fall was widely described as a $22.3 billion measure, and the one approved by the House was said to carry a price tag of $28 billion.
In fact, those figures were largely for show. They are simply the maximum that could be spent under the legislation over the rest of the decade. They bear little resemblance to what Congress will appropriate this year or is likely to appropriate in the years ahead.

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls On Germany To Be Partner

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 11

 BODY:
Acknowledging that a united Germany is now the powerhouse of Europe, President Clinton urged the Germans today to become America's main partners in integrating the former Communist nations of Eastern Europe with the economic and military institutions of the West.
Mr. Clinton's message was that the German-American military alliance must be replaced with a less lopsided partnership focused on economics and the unification of Europe. As Mr. Clinton noted, "Trade, as much as troops, will increasingly define the ties that bind nations in the 21st century." 
 American officials make clear that they consider the other European countries, like Britain and France, either too economically weak or too inward looking to play a leadership role in Europe these days. The "special relationship" is increasingly with Germany. The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, said after his talks with President Clinton that his nation, now that it is reunified, was ready to assume the more assertive posture Washington is seeking.
 
Dollar Not Discussed
 "The excuse that we had for the past 40 years was that as a divided country we were unable to take certain decisions," Mr. Kohl said. "That is something that is no longer valid. One cannot be a reunified country with 80 million people with the kind of economic strength that we have, with the kind of prestige we claim for ourselves, if we do not fully assume our responsibilities and fulfill our obligations."
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kohl said they did not discuss the state of the American dollar, which fell one full percent today against the German mark -- a huge amount for one day -- closing in Frankfurt at 1.5495 marks.
Mr. Clinton, the first American President to visit a united Germany, is touring Bonn and Berlin at a critical hinge of history. On Tuesday the President is to preside over the deactivation of the last American military unit in Berlin, where there has been an American troop presence for 50 years.
By coincidence, on the same day the German high court is expected to rule, probably in the affirmative, on the constitutionality of German troop participation in military operations, including peacekeeping missions, beyond the country's borders. And again by coincidence, Germany is finally coming out of the recession created by the economic demands of absorbing the former East Germany.
 
Integrating the East
 All have combined to make the long-anticipated debate about Germany's proper leadership role in Europe an immediate reality, and President Clinton timed his trip here to put America firmly on the side of an assertive German leadership posture.
After talks on this theme between President Clinton and Chancellor Kohl at the German leader's office in Bonn, Mr. Clinton said at a news conference: "We know from our experience how half of Europe was integrated through NATO and other institutions that built stability after World War II. At the heart of our discussion today was what we have to do to integrate Europe's other half, the new independent nations: Poland, the Baltic countries, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovak Republic and others."
While all the attention in the past year seems to have focused on when Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia and other former Warsaw Pact nations will be absorbed into the NATO military structure, the really more pressing question is when they are going to be integrated into the Western European economic structures, which have been shutting them out even more than NATO.
"The Chancellor and I," Mr. Clinton continued, "will do everything we can to integrate the newly independent countries of Europe into shared security with their neighbors, helping them to reform their economies, attract new investment, claim their place at the table with free and friendly nations of like mind. To imagine any of these things working out over the long run, the German American partnership will have to be maintained and strengthened."
Asked to comment on the pending German court decision about sending troops abroad, Mr. Clinton said, "I think anything that can be done to enable Germany to fulfill the leadership responsibilities that it is plainly capable of fulfilling is a positive thing."
 
A Vision Is Shared
 Mr. Clinton's trip here was meant to affirm the partnership with Bonn and to give a subtle boost to Mr. Kohl, whom the Americans are quietly backing in the German elections set for Oct. 16. Mr. Kohl, who has been Chancellor since 1982, has become Mr. Clinton's closest friend among foreign leaders. They share a common vision of Europe, a love of eating and a basically optimistic view of the world.
So as not to be accused of interfering in German politics, Mr. Clinton also met in Bonn with Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic Party leader and Mr. Kohl's chief opponent.
Late today, Mr. Clinton flew from Bonn to Berlin, with a brief stopover at Ramstein Air Force Base to visit with American troops.

HEADLINE: Galway Journal;
Defining 'Quality of Life' on the Crisp Celtic Coast

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GALWAY, Ireland

 BODY:
While many of Ireland's cities are trying to fight their way out of economic recession with ambitious urban development, this clean, windy city of 55,000 on the Atlantic Coast has decided that it has gone about as far as it should go with bricks and mortar.
The Galwegians, the residents of this 500-year-old city, say that they have enough new buildings pushing against the ancient gray walls of the port, and that a high quality of life does not require more construction. 
 They have relatively little street crime and a lot of history, a university, good theaters and the frequent sound of Gaelic spoken in public.
But perhaps most important, Galway has a lot of water. The River Corrib rushes through the city out to the ocean in swirls of white water. Salmon are there for the catching right in the city center. Swans glide along the river banks. Quiet, rubbish-free canals lead inland to the salmon weir and the domed Roman Catholic cathedral.
Any development plans here have a largely liquid center. They range from attracting more visitors for salmon-fishing and swan-watching to selling river water in container-ship loads to thirsty Arab nations. Tourists are coming in increasing numbers, particularly Americans no longer afraid to fly because of the threat of terrorism, which hurt business after the Persian Gulf war.
"There is a good buzz in Galway," said the Lord Mayor, Henry O'Connor. "We've expanded rapidly. In the 1980's we were the fastest growing city in Western Europe. The population went from 35,000 to 50,000 in about 10 years. But in the old days you could walk down the street and know everybody's name. Not now. I wouldn't like to see Galway going much further."
A new, bright red five-story apartment-office building in the old port, he said, has dwarfed the Spanish Parade area, where Columbus attended Mass in a local church, then set sail on one of his journeys. A monument to Columbus was recently defaced with the word "Choctaw" in black paint. Officials suspect it was the work of American visitors who feel Columbus had ravaged American Indians.
Although Galway's unemployment rate is 18 percent, about the same as the rest of the country, Mayor O'Connor said, "Galway hasn't suffered too much" in three years of recession because "we have a lot of tourism and a lot of students" who spend money.
The City Manager, Joe Gavin, said the loss of revenue and jobs due to layoffs last year at the local Digital plant would be more than offset by tourism and the opening of two United States technology companies, Boston Scientific and American Power.
Mayor O'Connor is in favor of making the canals navigable for fishermen. Only last year, he said, Ireland's most beloved Englishman, Jack Charlton, the coach of the national soccer team, was fishing there and drew such a crowd of admirers that their cars caused a traffic jam and the coach was asked to reel in.
But Mr. O'Connor, 48, a real estate agent, said he is against the proposal by an American company to sell water to Middle Eastern countries. "It's a danger if you get a dry spell," he said. "You'd expose harmful weeds, block navigation. And fishing is important here."
Mr. Gavin said that selling water was still under consideration and that it would bring Galway about $750,000 a year. "Our water is pristine -- clean, clean, clean, immaculate," he said.
To attract American tourists, Galway has a genealogical center. Jean Kennedy Smith, the United States Ambassador, spoke in June at the introduction of a genealogical magazine at a castle outside Galway. She recalled that she had once looked up her great-grandfather, Patrick Joseph Kennedy, on an Irish genealogy computer service and found out he was 28 and illiterate when he left this country in the 1840's.
The Ambassador was received as a celebrity, and several dozen people asked for her autograph.
Although crime rates are low, four residents were killed recently, including a mother and baby whose bodies were found in a wooded area and a Catholic priest whose body was found in the same area. No one has been charged.
The killings have revived calls for police officers to get out of their radio cars and to patrol, if not on bicycles as in the old days, then on foot.
There is also a debate over the traditional itinerants, once known as tinkers and now called travelers, who have lived a nomadic life for centuries. National and local officials want to settle them in towns or in specially equipped parking areas. But Galwegians are resisting such such settlements; many say the travelers bring crime.
Mr. Gavin said such fears are unfounded. But Mr. O'Connor said of the travelers, "Galway has been good to them, but we're probably getting to a stage where we say, 'Enough is enough.' "
Many other people here think that change would not be good for the city. Sheila O'Donnellan, a professional reciter of the works of Yeats and Joyce who has lived here for 40 years, summed it up: "My fear would be that in this unique place, the modern would take over and submerge the old traditional Galway. As it is now, Galway is the most livable city in Ireland."

Treasury Bonds Continue to Fall

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds fell for a fifth day amid expectations that this week's economic reports will show faster growth and rising inflation and lead to higher interest rates.
A decline in the dollar against the Japanese yen and German mark -- as well as higher commodity prices -- also helped drag down bonds, traders said. 
 Government reports this week on June producer and consumer prices, as well as retail sales, follow a report on Friday that the economy added far more jobs than expected in June. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent during the first quarter.
David Duerson, head trader at BA Securities in San Francisco, said traders confronted an economy building momentum as well as a currency in "desperate" shape. "There's not a lot to look forward to," he said.
The benchmark 30-year bond closed down 10/32 , or $3.13 for each $1,000 of bonds, to yield 7.72 percent. Earlier, the bond was down as much as 1/2 point to yield 7.74 percent.
The closing yield, up three basis points, was at its highest since President Clinton's election in November 1992. The two-year note yield was 6.25 percent, also up three basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Investors will not buy Treasury bonds unless the Federal Reserve signals whether it plans to raise interest rates again, said Alfred Jordan, who helps manage a $150 million government bond portfolio at Commerce Capital Management in Memphis.
"One aspect of this whole thing that's scary is the real lack of buyers out there," Mr. Jordan said. "It doesn't matter what kind of statistics come out. If there aren't any buyers, it's impossible for the market to do better."
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise overnight bank loan rates by as much as 50 basis points during the next month to head off inflation as the economy expands, analysts said. Since February, the Fed has raised the overnight rate four times, to 4.25 percent from 3 percent.
Wayne D. Angell, a former Fed governor who is now chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said yesterday that the Fed needed to raise rates by 100 basis points to forestall a recession in 1996 or 1997. Otherwise, long-term interest rates would surge so far and so fast that the economy would stall, he said.
"The Fed's got to be concerned that any growth slowdown we've seen has been temporary," Jerry Zukowski, an economist at Paine Webber, said. "The economy hasn't responded by slowing to the higher rates."
Economic growth hasn't caused inflation to jump yet. During the first five months of the year, inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was running at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in May, down from 3.2 percent for the first five months of 1993 and 2.7 percent during all of last year.
 
Labor Department Report on Jobs
 Still, Friday's report by the Labor Department that the economy added 379,000 jobs in June added to concern about inflation, which diminishes the value of bonds' fixed payments.
This week, the Government reports on June wholesale prices today, June consumer prices tomorrow, June retail sales on Thursday and June industrial production on Friday. Unexpected gains in those reports could touch off another round of Fed rate increases, traders and investors said.
To be sure, some investors said the Fed would not raise rates out of concern that higher rates would drive the economy into a recession.
"We've taken a lot of the spending power out of the public's hands with the rate increases we've already had," said Michael Link, who helps manage about $242 million in fixed-income investments at the Gradison-McDonald Government Income Fund.
"It's getting close to the straw that broke the camel's back," Mr. Link said, adding that if the Fed raised rates by 50 basis points, "I think the economy would collapse."
Bond yields were 6.3 percent before the Fed began raising rates in February. The record low yield is 5.77 percent, reached on Oct. 15. Changes in Treasury yields are important to the economy because they are the basis for rates for housing and auto loans.
The yield on the 30-year bond has climbed to more than 7.7 percent this year from 6.3 percent in February.
The following are the results in the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:

After a selloff, the auto stocks may hold new promise.

BYLINE: By James Bennet 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THROUGH the spring and into the summer, the auto makers and almost all financial analysts who cover them firmly predicted robust sales and earnings for the industry well into 1996. But the auto makers' stocks kept falling.
"The stock market has been saying for months now, 'We don't believe any of you guys,' " said Harvey Heinbach, an auto industry analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. Then, after an upbeat report on June sales last week, investors shed their doubts and aggressively bid up the stocks on Thursday. Although they have retreated a bit since then, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have held on to most of their recent gains. 
 Yesterday, G.M.'s shares closed at $51, off 37.5 cents, while Ford ended at $30.375, down 25 cents, and Chrysler was at $48.25, down 62.5 cents.
So has the sector bottomed out for the year? Ultimately, the answer depends on whether investors continue to have faith that the recovery is on track. "Who knows?" said Mr. Heinbach, who has recommended buying the stocks of the Big Three since before the selloff began early this year.
As interest rates began to rise earlier this year, investors fled many of the cyclical stocks on the theory that higher rates would choke the economic recovery. Over the last five months, the Big Three auto stocks lost about 18 percent of their value.
"This has been a very typical correction," said John Casesa, the auto industry analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York. He pointed out that during the last recovery, from 1983 to 1987, there were three similar corrections.
After each one, the stocks resumed their upward march, passing their old pre-correction peaks until the auto recovery itself hit new heights.
"You don't have to be worried about it as an investor," Mr. Casesa said. "There's a lot of appreciation in these stocks -- if you believe the recovery will continue."
Ah, the big "if."
This has been a peculiar recovery, particularly in the auto market. The fundamentals -- strong consumer confidence and a high average age for vehicles on the road -- remain in place. But sales have not been as strong as past recoveries would indicate. The reason, the optimists believe, is too little production capacity.
With most factories running flat-out, dealer inventories of hot-selling models like the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle are nevertheless abnormally low, restraining sales. And production shutdowns by the Big Three, as they shift to 1995 models, have virtually cut off supplies of some big-volume products, like the Chevrolet Lumina sedan.
But it is no simple matter to measure how many unmade vehicles are going unbought. "We're all reaching for straws in the wind to tell us what's happening with demand," Mr. Heinbach said.
The auto makers continue to insist that the demand is there. "The market is still quite strong," J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s new chief financial officer, said in presenting the company's midyear sales figures. G.M., making one of the industry's most conservative projections, estimates that sales of cars and light trucks will total 15.3 million this year, 10 percent above the 1993 level.
One clear measure of demand, and hence the durability of the recovery, is the auto makers' earnings. As they raise prices and slash rebates in the face of strong demand, the auto makers make more money from each sale.
 So it is a further demonstration of their optimism that auto industry analysts are predicting that the Big Three will report combined second-quarter earnings of up to $4.33 billion, close to double what they were a year ago.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
MOTOROLA INC. (MOT,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Motorola Inc. reported yesterday that second-quarter revenues and earnings were sharply higher, led by a 75 percent gain in sales of telecommunications equipment.
Motorola, the electronics manufacturer, said net income surged 63.8 percent, to $367 million, or 63 cents a share. The earnings were 5 cents higher than a mean estimate of 58 cents a share by 18 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. 
 Motorola's robust earnings increase is expected to forestall a repeat of last quarter, when its stock fell 5 percent after it missed analysts' earnings estimates by a penny a share. The results, however, were released after the stock market closed.
The company, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., also said sales increased 32.9 percent, to $5.4 billion.
"The U.S. markets have been doing very well," said Gary L. Tooker, the company's vice chairman and chief executive, "although increases in interest rates could moderate the rate of growth later in the year."
Motorola reported the greatest growth in its General Systems unit, where sales rose 75 percent, to $2.1 billion. The company cited strong increases in sales of cellular telephones and transmitting equipment in China and Japan.
Semiconductor products sales rose 23 percent, to $1.7 billion, while its communications segment, which includes pagers, posted a 26 percent gain in sales, to $1.4 billion.

HEADLINE: A Boom for On-Line Services

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Spurred by the success of America Online, Prodigy and other consumer information services that together are attracting more than a million new customers a year from home computer users, developers ranging from giant corporations to tiny start-ups are racing to build electronic communities in cyberspace.
In the last year the consumer response translated into a 25 percent annual growth rate, bringing total consumer subscriptions to on-line services to more than 5 million. 
 But while industry optimists expect such growth to continue, noting that the number of personal computer users, now 60 million, is steadily increasingly, others have concluded that there may not be enough gold in cyberspace to justify all the money that the prospectors are spending.
 
Glut Is Foreseen
 Analysts and even the developers themselves say the rush to cyberspace could lead to a glut of services that will overwhelm the relatively small market for consumer data. The 10 largest revenue producers among the on-line consumer services brought in only slightly more than $500 million last year.
"There's a shakeout on the horizon," said Rusty Williams, vice president and general manager of Delphi Internet Services of Cambridge, Mass., an on-line service provider owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. "The numbers are growing rapidly, but they won't be high enough to accommodate all the companies who are coming into the market."
Delphi sees room for itself, however. Currently the nation's fifth-largest general-interest on-line service for consumers, with close to 100,000 subscribers, Delphi expects its clientele to double over the next year.
Unlike the on-line information systems that evolved in the early years of the computer industry, which catered to business customers willing to pay handsomely for archived documents and raw data, the new interactive services are being developed for consumers who use home computers to supplement other information systems: the postal service, newspapers, magazines, television, telephones, books and backyard fences.
Aficionados might be willing to spend endless hours and hundreds of dollars each month on line, but most people are likely to devote far less time and money to this aspect of their busy lives. For service providers, the trick will be to distinguish themselves as either fun or functional enough to attract and keep customers.
"The different services are now challenging themselves to come up with creative ways to present information and find new sources of information," said Lisa Johnson, an analyst with the market research firm Link Resources in New York City.
"But what appears to be lacking is the compelling content that is going to sustain the subscriber base and generate usage dollars," she said.
Consumer on-line systems, which typically charge fees of $10 to $30 a month, use point-and-click computer-mouse software to give users relatively simple and immediate access over phone lines to a variety of services. These typically include news, on-line shopping, financial and stock market data, electronic mail, libraries of software and technical information, entertainment listings, games, advertising and discussion groups.
Some of these consumer services already offer, and others plan to offer, access to the Internet, a worldwide network of some 2.2 million host computers that provide information and services to an estimated 25 million people.
 
A Dozen Services
 The consumer category at present consists of about a dozen large, general-interest services led by Prodigy Information Services of White Plains, which claims 2 million members; Compuserve Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, with 1.7 million subscribers; America Online Inc. of Reston, Va., 900,000; General Electric's Genie, 350,000, and the News Corporation's Delphi Internet Services Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., with 100,000.
Adding in other, smaller services, the total number of consumer subscriptions is estimated at 5.5 million. However, the market is believed to be smaller than the sum of its parts because of the different ways that services count members, because a household may subscribe to more than one service and because many accounts are inactive.
"At end of 1993 the market was no bigger than 3.7 or 4 million subscribers," said Lisa Thorell, principal analyst with the International Data Corporation in San Jose. "Those are not the kind of numbers that are going to get the attention of national television advertisers or even the cable TV advertisers."
Yet Ms. Thorell and other analysts say the economics of the consumer services will demand that they find a way to attract advertisers to subsidize the cost of doing business -- just as advertising subsidizes television, newspapers and magazines. But some services, especially the newer ones, may find it necessary to operate with little or no profit to attract enough customers to make themselves attractive to advertisers.
Lorraine Sileo, an analyst with Simba Information Inc., a market researcher in Wilton, Conn., said that unless prices for the services fell below $10 a month, the market would be limited to an estimated 1.5 million to 1.8 million new users each year for several years.
And yet, some billion-dollar companies are trying to create or expand their own on-line services to appeal to broad audiences of PC users around the world. The big players include AT&T, Apple Computer, Microsoft and I.B.M. -- as well as cable television, telephone, Internet service provider and publishing companies.
The newest among them is Apple Computer's eWorld, which made its debut late last month for users of Macintosh computers.
Soon to come is an AT&T system called Personal Link Services that employs sophisticated software "agents" that automatically gather and process information for the user. An investor in gold bullion, for example, might program a software agent to search the news data base each night and present a compilation in the morning of all gold market news.
The Microsoft Corporation, whose DOS-Windows operating system software is included with a majority of personal computers sold in the Western world, is developing its own on-line service, code-named Marvel. By early next year, the software for Marvel is expected to be included with every new copy of Windows.
Apple is including its eWorld software with all new Macintosh computers, so if Microsoft can persuade other computer makers to bundle Marvel with the machines they sell, it would mean that virtually every personal computer sold in North America would come equipped to receive an on-line service.
For smaller competitors, such moves by the industry giants could pose a threat. But many hope the trend could also stimulate the market by creating a large enough on-line consumer market to support the dozens of small companies and start-ups that offer specialized services aimed at specific groups of consumers.
 
'Niche' Services Gain
 There are, or will be soon, "niche" on-line systems that appeal to women (Women's Wire and Echo), the digitally hip (Transom, Pipeline and @Wired), older hipsters (Senior Net), homosexuals (Digital Queers and Eye Contact), sports buffs (USA Today Information Center)), game players (The Imagination Network and Novalink) and computer buffs (Interchange and Applelink).
"We have a tremendous capacity for growth in two directions: more users and multiple services per user," said Michael Kolowich, president of Ziff-Davis Interactive of Cambridge, Mass., whose Interchange service for personal computer users, is expected to be available nationally by the end of the year.
Mr. Kolowich predicted the on-line market would follow the evolutionary pattern of magazines -- except much faster. "It took decades for print magazines to go from general-interest publications like Life and Look and The Saturday Evening Post to special interest media," he said. "The on-line world has compressed the normal development of a medium tenfold."
But Ms. Sileo of Simba Information is not convinced that the consumer market can support an abundance of of narrowly targeted on-line services. "I don't think the on-line market is quite ready to be sliced and diced that way," she said. "They don't have the audience yet."
 
An Optimistic Upstart
 But at least one upstart says does not intend to wait until the current lineup attracts a large audience.
 "The services today -- Prodigy, Compuserve and America Online -- are like the Big Three television networks before Fox," said Michael Collins, a 26-year-old former advertising director for Spy magazine who is starting a service called Transom. "They try to get something for everybody, games for 6-year-olds, stock quotes and everything in between, so it turns out that not too much information has an edge."
Mr. Collins is managing director of Reach Media Inc., which later this year plans to begin operating Transom from a loft in the SoHo district of Manhattan. Transom will be "younger, hipper, and a lot more fun" than mainstream consumer services, he said.
Aimed at the 18-to-34-year-old market and conceived as a sort of MTV for the digital generation, Transom will offer electronic forums for the young and restless, as well as information and entertainment by writers from Rolling Stone and the Comedy Central cable channel, for example. There may also be music, news and audio samples digitized for downloading onto subscribers' computers.
Mr. Collins says he is not worried by talk of an on-line industry shakeout and the number of competitors crowding the field. "If this was television, right now we're still in the era of staring at fuzzy black-and-white screens," he said. "This is just the beginning. It makes it that much more exciting and challenging."

GRAPHIC: Photo: With a welter of companies offering or planning consumer on-line computer services, some experts say an industry shakeout is inevitable.

It's Called Targeted Stock; Shun It, Some Experts Say

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
If some of Wall Street's financial engineers have their way, an exotic corporate financing tool known as targeted stock will be coming soon to a company near you.
When it does, some experts advise, run for the hills. 
 That is what many shareholders of the Kmart Corporation did when they voted down a proposal by the ailing retail company to issue targeted stock -- shares whose dividends would be linked to the performance of its specialty-store units but would have no guaranteed claim on their assets.
And based on the experience of a handful of earlier targeted-stock plans, the Kmart shareholders may have acted wisely, because the benefits of this technique are dubious.
"There really is no excuse for targeted stock," said Bruce Greenwald, professor of finance and economics at the Columbia University business school. "It is absolutely the purest form of financial engineering, and it yields no benefit at all."
Championed by investment bankers, targeted stock has gained a lot more attention in recent years. The most popular argument in favor of the mechanism is that it increases shareholders' value. And unlike spinoffs, targeted stocks help the parent company duck a potentially huge tax bill for capital gains.
Also known as alphabet or letter stock, targeted stock trades just like plain vanilla stock. It has its own stock symbol and may or may not pay a dividend, just like regular stock.
But it is not regular stock.
Targeted shares give their holders nothing more than a reason to believe they have a financial stake in a subsidiary of the company that issued the shares. If the subsidiary performs, the company delivers on its promise to pay out a souped-up dividend.
But because the subsidiary's assets and liabilities are mingled with those of the parent company, that dividend could vanish and the stock's price could fall the moment the parent company decides to divert the unit's earnings to satisfy its own liabilities.
Large institutional shareholders are snubbing such deals. They like to look at a company's underlying collateral to calculate what their investment might fetch in a worst-case situation. That analysis is impossible on targeted stocks because the corporate parent has first rights to any assets should financial problems arise, even if those problems crop up in a distant unit.
"It's sort of viewed as a mongrel that makes the valuation analysis quite difficult, so the technique is suspect with many large shareholders, including this one," said Kurt Schact, director of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which has led the shareholder revolt at Kmart. "We don't own any targeted stock."
Misconceptions arise because targeted stocks bear a striking but deceptive resemblance to shares that are often issued by subsidiaries that have made a clean break from their former parents. These spinoffs, brand-new companies whose shares are backed by their own assets and liabilities, offer investors "pure plays" on some industry or niche -- that is, an oil company stock or a steel company stock but not a combination of both in one stock.
The class E stock of General Motors, the granddaddy of all targeted stocks, is the most frequently cited example of a letter stock that has greatly maximized shareholders' value. In that 1984 deal, G.M. issued special shares intended to reflect the fortunes of the newly purchased Electronic Data Systems unit, primarily as a way of giving the founder of E.D.S., Ross Perot, a continuing stake in that business, and that business alone. The price of class E shares has increased by more than 200 percent in the decade since they were issued.
How much of that increase was related to the novel structure is anyone's guess. What many shareholders fail to grasp is that the class E shares are ultimately an investment in G.M. The auto maker, not E.D.S. or its class E shareholders, owns the assets of the computer services subsidiary. In the unlikely event that G.M. ever slid into serious financial trouble, it would be free to raid the assets of E.D.S.
Thus, owning class E shares is not really a pure play on E.D.S. And analysts and investors say that being a targeted stock was one of the things that scotched a merger between E.D.S. and Sprint earlier this year.
At least two recent targeted stock proposals -- one to separate RJR Nabisco's food group from its tobacco business, and the other to segregate Kmart's specialty-store earnings -- have been tabled indefinitely.
Other targeted stock offerings, including those of Ralston-Purina and USX, were done with another purpose in mind -- as a way to apply a tourniquet to a troubled business. They have generally not fared as well as the E.D.S. deal.
 
Two Plans Tabled
 That was the case, for example, when the USX Corporation's languishing steel business seemed to be obscuring the value of the company's healthy oil subsidiary. For each of their shares in the steel and oil conglomerate, USX's investors received one share of stock tied to the performance of the company's Marathon Oil unit and one-fifth of a share of stock that represented its steel operations.
Before the swap, USX shares traded at about $28. Now, the combined package of targeted stocks that shareholders received trades at about $23.50.
Last year, Ralston-Purina segregated its faltering Continental Baking unit from its basic food business using targeted stock instead of a spinoff. Though Ralston-Purina declined to comment, Nomi Ghez, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs who follows the company, said Ralston-Purina had chosen a targeted stock offering instead of a spinoff because it was concerned that the baking subsidiary would not fetch a high enough price to offset the taxes its parent would have paid on the sale.
Before the plan was announced, shares of Ralston-Purina traded at about $42 each. In the months after the deal, the combined package of original Ralston-Purina shares plus targeted stock in Continental Baking languished at about $37, at a time when food stocks were generally flat.
Ralston-Purina's decision in January to spin off its cereals businesses, rather than issue another targeted stock, seems to speak volumes about how companies increasingly view targeted stock. "The second time around, they did a spinoff because Continental Baking didn't work out," Ms. Ghez said. "The market just didn't receive the targeted stock all that well."
Philip Morris, Tenneco and Sears, Roebuck are three other companies that have politely declined the targeted-stock pitches of investment bankers.
 
Roller Coaster Ride
 Even G.M. had trouble replicating the success it enjoyed with E.D.S. when in 1985 the auto maker availed itself of the technique with its Hughes aerospace division. G.M.'s class H shares have given shareholders a roller coaster ride over the years.
Shareholders have fared better in Pittston, a mining company with interests in air freight and security services that was facing huge retiree medical liabilities from its coal operations. The package of targeted securities they received last year in the separated coal and services businesses has roughly doubled, in part because of a rebound in the steel industry.
But that deal was misunderstood by many investors, including at least one analyst for Lehman Brothers, Jeff Kessler, who was touting the service company's stock on the theory that this unit had escaped responsibility for the medical costs of retired coal miners.
To be sure, targeted stock deals confer some benefits. In addition to the tax advantages, they can help companies that want to stop short of a complete spinoff so that a subsidiary can retain access to a prized corporate asset like a companywide health care package or planning department.
Advocates of the technique also emphasize an increase in shareholders' value. Bankers contend that analysts, who usually specialize in one industry, fail to realize the value of a conglomerate because they do not understand all its businesses. By unbundling the businesses with targeted stocks, the thinking goes, each will gain the following of analysts who understand it.
Another argument for creating targeted stock is that the market prefers a pure play. Consultants also contend that targeted stocks make better incentives for the managers of subsidiaries because those shares are linked to the performances of those executives. "It's very effective in designing an appropriate incentive compensation system so managers can be rewarded in terms of something they can directly affect," said Joel M. Stern, a managing partner at Stern, Stewart & Company, a corporate finance advisory firm.
These arguments have some merit, critics of targeted stock say, but they are better addressed by going a step further and spinning off a subsidiary, which is much more straightforward and easier for investors to understand. "After hearing all of this, you have to ask yourself why you'd go to all that trouble when you could just do a spinoff," Professor Greenwald of Columbia said.
 
Advantage of Spinoffs
 Even Brian Finn, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at CS First Boston who worked on two such deals for USX, conceded that spinoffs were often optimal. "Most of the time, a spinoff is the better answer so you can eliminate any debate about valuation," he said. But, he argued, because spinoffs are not always possible because of tax and credit-rating consequences, targeted stock is the next best thing.
Mr. Finn and other proponents of the technique say some of the big disappointments are commentaries on those companies or their industries, and not on the technique. The package of securities that shareholders received from USX, for instance, is "not down because it's a targeted stock," Mr. Finn said. "It's down because Marathon is down, and Marathon is down because all oil companies are down right now."

HEADLINE: Taxpayers May Be Paying Twice for Some Drugs

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Americans often pay for their medicine twice once through taxes and again at the pharmacy -- because the Government is not keeping tabs on the way private industry uses taxpayer-financed research, a new investigation concludes.
Under law, the Government has rights to any drug or medical device developed through Federally financed research. Among other things, the Government is entitled to lower the price of an excessively expensive treatment. 
 But it can only do so if it can prove that Government-financed research was used to develop the drug, and the National Institutes of Health have lost track of how its money is spent, concludes an investigation by the inspector general of the Department Health and Human Services.
 
One Person Keeping Track
 "N.I.H. needs to do a better job," Assistant Inspector General Michael Hill said at a Congressional hearing today. One employee is supposed to track the $8 billion the N.I.H. annually awards to outside scientists and find out how many medical discoveries result, he said.
"One person is watchdogging this $8 billion program? Unbelievable," said Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House small-business regulation subcommittee, which requested the inquiry.
When scientists receive patents even partially financed by the Government, they must report them to N.I.H., which then has certain rights. If the agency thinks the drug is priced too high, it can license the product to a competitor. It can also make sure that companies do not refrain from developing cheaper treatments, and it can make sure that Government-financed drugs are available in the United States, not just abroad.
Such steps can be effective. The N.I.H.'s threat to step in when an AIDS drug, AZT, hit the market is credited with halving its price.
But Mr. Hill discovered one agency, the Scripps Research Institute in California, that has reported only 51 federally financed patents since 1979. The institute has been awarded at least 94 federally financed patents in that time and receives $70 million a year from the National Institutes of Health
A cursory look at 25 other institutions that get N.I.H. financing showed similarly low reporting rates, leading Mr. Hill to believe that underreporting is rampant, he said.
 
Cost to N.I.H. and Consumers
 Since the N.I.H. can buy Federally financed treatments without paying royalties, it may be paying too much for the drugs it buys for use at its campus in Bethesda, Md. And those drugs may be priced too high for the consumer, critics contend.
"There has got to be some sort of commensurate recognition of the taxpayers' investment when those drugs are priced," Representative Wyden said. "What we're looking at is, what's the best way to do that?"
The N.I.H. is studying the problem, said a spokeswoman, Anne Thomas. Scripps says it "regrets these past failures" and has corrected its reporting system.
But critics say the government must insure that drug price tags reflect taxpayer investments. "Taxpayers are funding an awful lot of work out there, said Peter Arno, a health economist at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine, "but if they create a product that's too expensive, that's as good as no product at all."
Government-financed drugs cost three times as much as drugs developed solely by pharmaceutical companies, according to a study by the Taxpayers Assets Foundation in Washington.
From 1987 to 1991, the Food and Drug Administration approved 10 significant new drugs for severe illnesses, and seven were financed by taxpayers, that study concluded. Of the 37 cancer drugs approved since 1955, 34 were financed by the Government. Yet the median wholesale price for company-financed drugs was $1,485, while drugs financed by the Government cost $4,480.
The N.I.H. is "this Federal Santa Claus," said a foundation officer, James Love. "It's really a ripoff for the taxpayers to have to buy the super-expensive drug" when they have already paid to develop the medicine, he said.

HEADLINE: Opponents of Haiti's Military Urge Rights Monitors to Stay

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 12

 BODY:
Supporters of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, urged international human rights monitors today to remain in the country and continue investigating increasing reports of abuses.
The monitors, a joint civilian mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States, were ordered Monday by the military-backed Government to leave. They are to go Wednesday. 
 The group decided to leave because the army said it could not guarantee the security of the 104 members, said Colin Granderson, executive director of the mission.
The Government of Emile Jonassaint accused the monitors of disturbing public order and threatening the security of the state.
 
Departure Draws Criticism
 "This is a setback to the Haitian people," said a top aide to Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was appointed by Father Aristide. The aide said the United Nations and the O.A.S. were tacitly approving the military Government. "We are the legitimate Government and we were not consulted," he added.
Today, tensions increased after radio reports that at least a dozen people had been killed in Leogane, about 20 miles south of here.
Foreign journalists who went to Leogane to investigate said the bodies were covered, but residents said they appeared to have been killed somewhere else and dropped in Leogane because no one there had reported missing relatives.
Charles David, Foreign Minister of the Jonassaint Government, defended the expulsion, saying the mission's mandate was "illegal and irregular." Mr. David said at a news conference that members of the mission were carrying guns and hand-held radios without permits.
"I want to remind you that Haiti is not at war with anyone," Mr. David said. "Haiti is not threatening anyone. We are put under an embargo, so therefore the Government will do what it thinks is its duty."
 
The Last Monitors
 Today during a news conference at the monitors' headquarters in Montagne Noire, a well-to-do suburb, Mr. Granderson said, "The de facto authorities have chosen to take on a heavy responsibility in ordering us, under threat, to leave the country."
The departure of the mission will leave a void in the monitoring of human rights abuses, which diplomats say have been rising steadily. Various organizations estimate that four Haitians are killed daily as a result of political repression.
The mission came to Haiti last year as part of an accord whose aim was to pave the way for the return of Father Aristide. Last October the mission left abruptly after armed thugs prevented a United States Navy ship, the Harland County, from unloading about 300 American and Canadian soldiers who were to rebuild roads and other facilities in Haiti.
The monitors moved to the neighboring Dominican Republic, returning to Haiti about two months later. Mr. Granderson said that this time, too, the group would return.
"It was tedious work, sometimes a thankless task, which has profoundly affected them," Mr. Granderson said, referring to the monitoring of reports of violence. "In forcing us to leave, the military officials and the de facto Government have implicity recognized the importance of the mandate with which the mission has been entrusted."
As the mission prepared to leave on an Air France flight, United States Coast Guard cutters continued to repatriate Haitian refugees, returning 747 boat people today. Refugee advocates say the Clinton Administration should not be returning any Haitians because of the worsening human rights conditions here.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
The Last Line Out
 UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Special to The New York Times) -- The rights monitors are to leave Haiti on a scheduled flight by Air France, the only international airline serving Port-au-Prince, United Nations officials said today. Air France has three flights a week to Guadeloupe, a French island in the Caribbean.
The monitors have been confined to Port-au-Prince since last week because of threats they received when they tried to travel to investigate human rights abuses.
The Security Council said today that "this provocative behavior directly affects the peace and security of the region." The statement, initiated by the United States, called the expulsion "a serious escalation in the defiant stance of Haiti's illegal de facto regime towards the international community."
On May 6, when it tightened its economic sanctions against Haiti, the Security Council voted to ban all flights in and out of Haiti to cut off drug trafficking, which is believed to be a major source of foreign currency for the military Government. Only Air France still has flights, but United States officials said today that they expected these to end soon.

HEADLINE: Death of Kim: An Edgy Reappraisal

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 12

 BODY:
For more than four decades, ever since the North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung launched the Korean War, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and the peninsula in ruins, many South Koreans and Americans have been awaiting the death of this dangerous leader as a moment to rejoice.
But something strange has happened since Mr. Kim died on Friday at 82, reportedly of a heart attack. Not only have many people here failed to applaud his passing but, as a Government official put it today, there is even some disappointment among top policy makers. 
 More important, this restrained response would probably have been quite different if Mr. Kim had died just a few weeks earlier, before he suddenly took a conciliatory line in relations with South Korea and the United States.
 
An Heir Sires Uncertainty
 "We are confused," the South Korean official acknowledged. And a Western diplomat said, "There is a sense of letdown here."
Of course, there are plenty of reasons for finding the future more worrying than the past.
The uncertainty over the new policies of the hard-line Communist Government are an important source of apprehension. Mr. Kim's son, Kim Jong Il, a reclusive man who once ordered the kidnapping of a South Korean film director to enliven his country's cinema, appears to be consolidating his position, and that has left many here nervous.
In addition, there is speculation that the younger Mr. Kim does not have the charisma to maintain absolute power, as his father did. There is talk of coups and civil war.
But several officials and diplomats acknowledged that the unusual turn of events had led to a reassessment of the late Mr. Kim.
 
Nuclear Nervousness
 For the previous 18 months, Mr. Kim had been heading toward a collision with the United States and the United Nations over his refusal to allow international inspection of sites where North Korea was thought to be developing nuclear weapons.
There was fear that North Korea had produced some plutonium, the key component, and that it was about to extract more.
The war of nerves had reached the point where South Korea and the United States had decided to seek economic sanctions against the North, which North Korea warned could lead to war. Mr. Kim had seldom loomed so ominously.
And then suddenly, last month, after the mediation of former President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Kim softened his position. He agreed to hold the first summit meeting with the South Korean President, Kim Yong Sam, and to open high-level negotiations with the United States. In turn, the United States eased some of its demands.
 
Time for a Reassessment
 South Korean officials had gotten as far as working out details on security and communications for the meeting in Pyongyang, which had been scheduled to begin July 25. And the North Korean negotiator had just held the first meeting with his American counterpart in Geneva, with the mood described as amicable.
Both those diplomatic openings have been postponed. [The North Korea radio said Wednesday that officials would meet United States representatives on Sunday in New York to arrange a resumption of talks, Reuters reported from Tokyo, citing the monitoring service Radiopress.]
Still, these modestly hopeful signs appear to have had a big effect on the thinking of officials here and in Washington. There was even speculation that because the opening was so promising, hard-liners in North Korea had Mr. Kim killed to halt the progress, although the South Koreans and the Americans have said there is no evidence of this.
South Korean leaders, especially the President, have been conspicuous in saying little publicly. They have forgone an opportunity to articulate their judgments on Kim Il Sung's bitter legacy and the lessons to be drawn. Officials have said they do not want to poison the atmosphere, since many hope a new summit meeting can be arranged.
 
The Vitriol Fades
 Han Sung Chu, South Korea's Foreign Minister, said he hoped the new leadership would "keep alive the recently created momentum," as though the weight of history were already behind this new opening.
And in North Korea, too, there are signs of a change in attitude, however temporary.
The official North Korean news media have all but abandoned their acid forms of address toward Seoul and Washington. The huge speakers blaring anti-American propaganda at the Demilitarized Zone have stopped. The North Korean press even reported approvingly the expression of condolence from President Clinton, who was vilified in the past.
This change could be reversed, of course, when the period of mourning for Mr. Kim ends on Sunday. The fact that nobody knows what will happen, or feels any confidence in predictions, has only added to a surge of nostalgia for Mr. Kim.

HEADLINE: With a Few Strides, Clinton Celebrates Germany's Unity

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 12

 BODY:
President Clinton paid tribute today to the end of Berlin's long and bitter schism, striding across the line that once divided the city and lowering for the last time the flag of the American forces whose vigil here began on July 4, 1945.
From the Brandenburg Gate, a symbol of a divided Europe, Mr. Clinton faced east in celebration and told some 50,000 Berliners who thronged Pariser Platz that he rejoiced with them that "Berlin ist frei!" 
 Coming nearly five years after the Berlin wall fell, this visit of a United States President seemed belated to many. But Mr. Clinton accommodated with exuberance. With American and German flags presenting a forest of color behind him, the President followed his idol, John F. Kennedy, in using the German language to proclaim an eternal bond.
"Amerika steht an Ihrer Seite, jetzt und fur immer," he declared, promising that "America stands on your side, now and forever."
 
A Symbolic Crossing
 Even more vivid was the scene when Mr. Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, accompanied only by their wives, passed beneath the gate's towering neo-Gothic columns, across the stretch of land where the Berlin wall stood and into the crowd that had gathered in the former East Berlin.
As the High Court ended the constitutional prohibition on a German role in combat operations abroad, Mr. Clinton's visit seemed truly to mark the end of an era. In helping to retire the colors of the Berlin Brigade, Mr. Clinton said farewell to an American unit that was dispatched at the height of Berlin wall crisis in 1961 to reinforce the units based here at the end of World War II.
By early September, the Russian, British and French forces will also be withdrawn.
In expectation of today's High Court decision, some of Germany's neighbors had expressed uneasiness at the prospect that German forces might once again mount military missions abroad. But Mr. Clinton has used his visit here to campaign for a more assertive Germany, and he proclaimed himself today to be "fully comfortable" with the decision.
 
Earlier Visitors
 In addressing Berliners from the Brandenburg Gate, Mr. Clinton joined a roster of Presidents who have chosen it as a symbol of their times.
When President Kennedy came in 1963, he tried to peer over the gate into East Berlin. But its openings had been blocked with giant banners, and it was from the West Berlin city hall that he delivered his famous speech identifying Americans with the plight of Berliners. In 1987, East German guards paced edgily near the gate as President Reagan, speaking from the Western side, challenged Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, to "open this gate!" and "tear down this wall!"
But today, with the wall no more than a memory except in a few preserved places, President Clinton and Chancellor Kohl strode side by side from the Reichstag, the once and future seat of Government, through a gate that is again open to all.
 
Lots of Happy Germans
 Far from the tension that has racked past Presidential visits, the mood today was joyous, with a beating sun and strains of rock and military bands creating a festival scene. Some in the crowd seemed weary to be told once again that their city was free, but when Mr. Clinton put his college German to work, he was greeted with roars of approval.
"Nothing will stop us," he said in his hosts' language. "Everything is possible. Berlin is free!"
German police initally said the crowd numbered about 50,000, but the Secret Service later estimated it at 100,000. In either case, it was nothing like the swollen masses that turned out for an American President at the height of the cold war.
But it still spilled well beyond the East Berlin plaza, a no man's land under Communist rule, And after leaving the podium, Mr. Kohl proclaimed the event to have marked "an unforgettable hour."
 
Short and Sweet
 Even in its brevity -- the two leaders were the only ones to speak, and Mr. Clinton's speech lasted just eight and a half minutes -- the back-to-back appearances established an emotional high point in a week that took the President from Latvia to Poland to Italy to Germany. He left Berlin tonight. [The President arrived back in Washington late Tuesday.]
When the Berlin wall fell in the autumn of 1989, followed within months by Germany's reunification, President Bush initially seemed unnerved by the rapid pace of events, and although he attended an economic summit in Munich in 1992, he never paid the triumphal visit to Berlin that Mr. Clinton did today.
In some ways, Mr. Clinton's farewell to the Berlin Brigade was even more evocative, mostly because it foreshadowed the next stage of a Europe transformed. While tens of thousand of American soldiers remain elsewhere in Germany, the handing over of McNair Barracks, the brigade's base, underscored the extent of what has been a rapid American withdrawal.
At the afternoon ceremony, Mr. Clinton pledged once again to hold the line against military cuts sought by his fellow Democrats, saying he remained committed to maintaining 100,000 troops in Europe.
 
'America Salutes You'
 But in a setting in which he was his most Presidential, Mr. Clinton stood erect in the back of a jeep, grasping only a roll bar, as he and two Army generals reviewed the 4,000 soldiers on a parade ground.
Then, as an honor guard rolled the red and blue brigade flag around its staff and thrust it into its long case, Mr. Clinton reached out to hold it for a moment before handing it over to the unit's command sergeant major.
"With the cold war over, we gather to honor those Americans who helped bring it to an end," Mr. Clinton said to the unit. "America salutes you. Mission accomplished."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From Senate Hearings on Supreme Court Nominee

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today on the nomination of Judge Stephen G. Breyer to the United States Supreme Court, as transcribed by Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service:
 
STATEMENT BY JUDGE BREYER
 I was born, as you heard, and I grew up in San Francisco. I attended public schools: Grant Grammar School, Lowell High School. My mother was from St. Paul, Minn. Her parents were immigrants from East Prussia, which is now part of Poland. 
 My mother was a very intelligent, very practical, public-spirited kind of person, and she, like many mothers, had an enormous influence on me.
She was the one who made absolutely clear to me in no uncertain terms that whatever intellectual ability I might have means nothing and won't mean anything unless I can work with other people and use whatever talents I have to help them. So I joined the Boy Scouts, I did work as a delivery boy, I did dig ditches for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and I mixed salads up in the city's summer camp. . . .
My mother really didn't want me to spend too much time with my books, and she was right. I mean, my ideas about people do not come from libraries.
My father was born in San Francisco. He worked as a lawyer and an administrator in the San Francisco public school system for 40 years. I have his watch, as you said, Senator. He was a very kind, very astute and very considerate man. He and San Francisco helped me develop something I would call a trust in, almost a love for the possibilities of a democracy. My father always took me ---- as child, he'd take me with him into the voting booth. I'd pull down the lever, and he'd say, "We're exercising our prerogative." He'd take me to candidates' nights.
Our school used to go up to Sacramento to see the legislature in session. There was Youth in Government Day. There was Boys State. All this led me to believe not just that government can help people, but that government is the people, it is created through their active participation. And that's really why despite the increased cynicism about basic government -- and we have really seen vast improvements in the fairness of government -- I still believe that with trust and cooperation and participation, people can work through their government to improve their lives.
 
Relevance of Law
 In 1957, as you said, I was ---- I served in the Army for a little while. I studied in England. I returned to Harvard Law School. And then I clerked for Justice Arthur Goldberg, who became a wonderful, lifelong friend. After two years in the antitrust division in the Justice Department, I went back to Harvard to teach, and to Massachusetts to live, and for the last 27 years I have been privileged to live in Cambridge and work in Boston. I love teaching. I love my students. But if I were to pick out one feature of the academic side of my life that really influenced me especially, I think it would be this: The opportunity to study law as a whole helped me understand that everything in the law is related to every other thing, and always, as Holmes pointed out, that whole law reflects not so much logic as history and experience.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Working here on this committee in the 1970's, I learned a great deal about Congress, about government, and about political life. There were disagreements to resolve, but everyone shared the same basic ground rules, basic assumptions about democracy, freedom, fairness and the need to help others. These vast areas of widely shared belief are what has shaped the law of America and the lives of all Americans.
Since 1980, I've been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. That's Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico and Rhode Island. Because of my colleagues and the work itself, this job is a great honor, a great privilege, and it's been a great pleasure to have.
 
Judges' Isolation
 I've tried to minimize what I think of as some of the less desirable aspects of the job, one that Justice Goldberg really felt strongly about, that judges can become isolated from the people whose lives their decisions affect. I've continued to teach and to participate in the community and in other activities which are important in connecting me to the world outside the courtroom. I have been helped in this task by my wife and her work at Dana Farber and at Cambridge Hospital, which shows me and others some of the sadness in this world as well as its hopes and its joys.
I believe that law must work for people. That vast array of Constitution, statutes, rules, regulations, practices, procedures -- that huge, vast web -- has a single basic purpose.
That purpose is to help the many different individuals who make up America from so many different backgrounds and circumstances, with so many different needs and hopes. Its purpose is to help them live together productively, harmoniously, and in freedom. Keeping that ultimate purpose in mind helps guide a judge through the labyrinth of rules and regulations that the law too often becomes, to reach what is there at bottom: the very human goals that underlie the constitutions and the statutes that Congress writes.
I believe, too, in the importance of listening to other points of view. As a teacher, I discovered I could learn as much from students as from books. On the staff of this committee, it was easy to see how much senators and staff alike learn from each other, from constituents, from hearings. I think the system works that way. It works better than any other system. And our task is to keep trying to improve it.
My law school diploma refers to law simply as those wise restraints that make men free. Women, too. All of us. I believe that too.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I might add one thing, if I might, on a slightly different subject. I want to add this, if I may, and that is recently I know that -- and this is important to me -- that in recent weeks there have been questions raised about the ethical standard that I applied in sitting on certain environmental cases in the First Circuit at a time when I had an investment, an insurance investment in Lloyd's.
I recognize that this question has been raised by people of good faith, and there is nothing more important to me than my integrity and my reputation for impartiality. It is obviously a most important thing to preserve total public confidence in the integrity of the judicial branch of government. I have reviewed those cases again, and the judicial recusal statute, and I personally am confident that my sitting in those cases did not present any conflict of interest. Of course my investment was disclosed to the public. There has been absolutely no suggestion that Lloyd's was involved as a name party in any of the cases on which I sat. I know of no such involvement.
The judicial recusal statute does require recusal as well if you have one case that has some kind of direct and predictable financial impact on some investment; that is to say if it's not a speculative or remote or contingent impact. The cases on which I sat did not violate this standard either. That issue has been carefully looked into by independent ethics experts who share my view.
But, Mr. Chairman, as I said, I recognize the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest or even the appearance of such conflicts, and that standard is essential for all judges, and especially essential for judges of the nation's highest court. So I certainly promise I will do all I can to meet it, including what I shall immediately do is ask the people who handle my investments to divest any holdings in insurance companies as soon as possible.
And with respect to Lloyd's itself, I resigned in 1988, though because of one syndicate that remains open I have been advised that I ---- I can leave altogether by the end of 1995, but I intend to ask the people involved to expedite my complete termination of any Lloyd's relationship. I'll be out of that as soon as I possibly can be. And finally, as I go forward, I certainly will keep in mind the discussion that has arisen over the last few days and I will take it into account in reviewing any possible conflict whatsoever.
 
QUESTIONS BY JOSEPH R. BIDEN
Democrat of Delaware
Q. In recent years we have seen new challenges to the efforts of government at all levels to adopt regulations that government believes are designed to protect the environment and promote a public goal. These challenges have taken the form of asking the court to change how it has interpreted the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Less than three weeks ago, the Supreme Court of the United States decided a case called Dolan vs. Tigard . . . where using the takings clause, the court rejected a local town measure intended to reduce flooding and traffic congestion caused by a business's development along a river. This decision follows a case decided two years earlier, Lucas vs. South Carolina Coastal Council. And in these two cases, the court adopted a new standard for reviewing the takings clause.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Now, my question is this: Is there any doubt in your mind that after Dolan and after Lucas that it is at least incrementally more difficult for the government to regulate zoning and environmental laws than it was prior? Not impossible, not ---- but just incrementally at least more difficult, or am I off on that?
JUDGE BREYER No, no, you're not off. . . . Absolutely, the dissent you see in that absolutely thought that that was so.
And the reason that I hesitate a little bit is there is something special about that case, and what is I think a little special about the case is that it did at least arguably involve a physical occupation of a piece of property. And at the same time, they didn't make all that much out of it, and then . . . they used this test "rough proportionality" and what exactly is that; it looks as if it's a lot ---- a little tougher.
And so where I end up in my mind is that this is an area that's not determined forever, that there are likely to be quite a few cases coming up, that this problem of how you work out when it goes too far is something undoubtedly will come up again in the future, and there's a degree of flexibility and flux in these opinions that I think haven't made a definite decision forever.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I think, Senator, that you'd have very, very wide agreement with you across a very, very wide spectrum with what Holmes ---- that the Constitution does not enact into law Herbert Spencer's social status, and what he meant by that is there is no particular theory of the economy that the Constitution enacts into law.
That doesn't mean property has no protection; there is a takings clause in the Constitution. It doesn't mean that people's clothes and toothbrushes are somehow at stake and could be swept away randomly. What it means is that the Constitution, which is a document that basically wants to guarantee people rights that will enable them to lead live of dignity, foresees over the course of history that a person's right to speak freely and to practice his religion is something that is of value, is not going to change.
But one particular economic theory or some other economic theory is a function of the circumstances of the moment, and if the world changes so that it becomes crucially important to all of us that we protect the environment, that we protect health, that we protect safety, the Constitution is not a bar to that, because its basic object is to permit people to lead lives of dignity.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Another way to affect the basic rights of individuals who do not have economic power is the way in which the Court interprets statutes, passed by the legislature and signed by the President.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Now, several years ago the Environmental Protection Agency decided to phase out the use of asbestos, because it posed many health risks, including the risk of cancer. A Federal appeals court reversed the E.P.A.'s ban on asbestos in a case you discussed in your most recent book.
The court decided that the statute under which the E.P.A. acted could not possibly have been intended to allow E.P.A.'s asbestos ban because the ban cost so much money for every human life it might save.
Now, my question, Judge, is, is it reasonable for a judge to infer what Congress intended by looking at how much it cost to implement what Congress intended?
A. You can't answer the question "never." It would depend very much on what you had in mind in the statute. I wrote about that case in my book. . . . And I wrote really two opposite things about ---- absolutely opposite. The first thing I wrote about it is I thought what was in the mind of the court. And I thought what was in the mind of the court is they found an example where they thought that E.P.A. was imposing a ban that cost about a quarter of a billion dollars and it would save hardly anybody ----
Q. But it would save somebody.
A. Yes, it was a ---- it was like the number of people ---- they used a kind of absurd example about the number of people who die of toothpicks or eating toothpicks, or something like that. But that's the first way I used it in the book was to show that there are some E.P.A. regulations which indeed seem to be very expensive ways of going about saving lives.
The second way is the opposite way I used that case in the book, because that case also provided an example of what you're suggesting, that it isn't a very good idea for courts to get involved in making that decision, that's more a decision for Congress to make. And what I said when I discussed the case for the second time is look how the judges, even if they have an example of what they think is absolutely wrong, look what they have to do; they have to say that there is a rule of law that prevents that.
And the rule of law that they enunciated in that case was a rule of law that said agencies have to look at all the alternatives, or many of them, before they do anything. But if you take that rule of law seriously, how can agencies have the time to do all that kind of thing?

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Now, if Congress delegates authority to an agency to consider cost and benefits in implementing the statute, your view is then that the court should, unless there is a clear disregard of that requirement, yield to the agency?
A. Absolutely. Absolutely.
 
QUESTIONS BY EDWARD M. KENNEDY
Democrat of Massachusetts
Q. You've been one of the leading scholarly commentators on administrative law and regulations, and why ---- obviously these subject seem dry and arcane ---- they can be of enormous importance to every American. Americans have a right to expect that the food they eat, and the water they drink, and the medications they take, and the air they breathe, and the place where they work will be safe and free from dangerous substances or machinery. Congress passes the law that set the broad standards in these and other areas, but it's up to the administrative agencies like the E.P.A. and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and then the F.D.A. to adopt the regulations that spell out the standards, to apply them in particular situations to protect the health and safety. . . .
My question is how do you respond to the suggestion that some have made that you are hostile to the health and safety regulation?
JUDGE BREYER I've said in my book that I think regulation is necessary in those areas. I guess that if you wanted a simple statement ----a simple statement, I wrote a book review not too long ago in which I tried, because it was written about the economics of AIDS, and I wanted to explain in that book what I saw as an important difference, as you have said, actually ---- an important difference between what you might call classical economic regulation, like airlines or trucks, and the regulation involving health, safety and the environment.
And I said, "As to the first, trucking, airlines, it isn't really surprising that economics may help; it isn't the whole story, but it tells a significant amount of the story because our object there is to get low prices for consumers, and maybe economics can help us."
When you start talking about health, safety and the environment, the role is much more limited, because there no one would think that economics is going to tell you how much you want to spend helping the life of another person. If in fact people want to spend a lot of money to help save earthquake victims in California, who could say that was wrong? And what I ended up there saying is that in this kind of area it's probably John Donne, the poet, who has more to tell us about what to do than Adam Smith, the economist. That's a decision for Congress to make reflecting the values of people.
 
QUESTIONS BY STROM THURMOND
Republican of South Carolina<HE
Q. Judge Breyer, if confirmed, you will succeed Justice Blackmun, who recently stated his belief that capital punishment is inherently flawed under the Constitution. While I disagree with his pronouncement, I want to know if you find his position reasonable in light of Supreme Court decisions in this area and your own personal reflections on whether capital punishment is constitutional under appropriate circumstances.
JUDGE BREYER Senator, if a judge has strong personal views on a matter as important as the death penalty, views that he believes might affect his decision in such a case, he should perhaps, if they are very strong ---- and this happens sometimes in lower courts, I've seen it happen where you feel you have a personal view that doesn't necessarily reflect the law, and you might take yourself out of the case. I have no such personal view in respect to the death penalty, so I would sit on such a case in respect to the constitutionality of the death penalty.
It seems to me that the Supreme Court has considered that matter for quite a long time in a large number of cases. And indeed, if you look at those cases, you will see that the fact that there are some circumstances in which the death penalty is consistent with the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Constitution is, in my opinion, settled law. At this point it is settled.

HEADLINE: A Suspicious Fire Tests Strength of a Synagogue's Members

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
For 90 years the grand but battered synagogue has stood by the sea in the Rockaways, weathering the loss of Jews and, eventually, everyone else as urban renewal stripped bare the land stretching for 150 blocks around it. The dwindling and aging membership of Congregation Derech Emunoh somehow found the wherewithal to keep it open, cherishing the moments they could spend praying in the same pews that had supported their parents and grandparents.
But the determination of its 40 members came close to exhaustion yesterday morning when an early-morning fire destroyed much of the synagogue's ceiling and roof. Fire department officials said the two-alarm blaze was suspicious in origin, and because it involved a synagogue, the case was being investigated by the police as a possible bias incident. Though the 600-seat structure could be rebuilt, the president of the synagogue said he did not believe it was worth trying to raise the necessary funds when the congregation was already barely surviving on its memories.
 
'This Is the End'
 "I doubt very much that we will have a congregation here any longer," said Robert Wein, the president, a third-generation member of Derech Emunoh who travels from Manhattan every week to pray next to the memorial plaque with his grandfather's name on it. "To spend hundreds of thousands on the roof when there is no Jewish community here any longer -- it's just not practical. This is the end." 
 Others in the congregation, however, remained hopeful that the money and energy could be found to revive the institution, a relic of the days when the Rockaway peninsula had a large Jewish population and residents thronged its boardwalks and sidewalks on Saturdays walking to their synagogues. David Cohen, the synagogue's rabbi, said a group of younger Orthodox Jews had recently begun attending Sabbath services, and predicted that they would not easily abandon the congregation.
"It sometimes takes an emergency like this to make people of good will realize how much they want this building," said Rabbi Cohen, who predicted it would reopen in time for High Holiday services in September. "This is a historic synagogue, and there has been interest from people all over the country who grew up here or were bar mitzvahed here."
The weatherbeaten, neo-Georgian synagogue, at Beach 67th Street and Rockaway Beach Boulevard in the Arverne section of Queens, was already a magnificent ruin even before the fire. Two of its towering Ionic columns are missing, and the broad brick steps leading to its boarded-up main entrance long ago crumbled and were covered with weeds. The paint on its patterned tin ceiling had mostly peeled away, and many of its stained-glass windows fell victim to thrown rocks. Its heating system has never been repaired after vandals ripped out the pipes a few years ago, and services can only be held from April to October.
Yesterday morning, after the embers had cooled and the 100 firefighters had left, members walked warily through the doors to find that a third of the tin ceiling had fallen to the pews of the now waterlogged, blackened sanctuary. There was also extensive damage to an exterior wall and to many prayer books, although the ark and pulpit were unaffected and the Torahs were preserved in a safe.
Fire officials said the blaze was reported about 4:30 A.M. and was brought under control at 5:55 A.M. Two firefighters were taken to Peninsula General Hospital with minor injuries, said Cecelia Cox, a fire department spokeswoman.
A police spokesman, Capt. Anthony Ottomano of the 100th Precinct, said the fire was being investigated as a possible bias incident because of the religious nature of the building, the time of day it occurred, and the fact that it apparently began on the outside of the structure. Captain Ottomano said there were no suspects.
 
Waiting for Assistance
 Since the 1950's, when Jews began to abandon the Arverne area and poorer, mostly black residents moved in, the synagogue has awaited a rescuer. The city bought the building and all of the surrounding property in preparation for a huge urban renewal project that never came. Alone among the surrounding structures, the synagogue was left standing in the hopes that new housing to be built on the vacant lots would bring new congregants, but the most recent redevelopment proposal collapsed along with the real estate market in 1992.
Mr. Wein, tired and distraught after decades of struggling to hold the congregation together, did not sound indomitable yesterday. But some of the younger members, entranced by the building's faded beauty and stark setting, said their work was not finished.
"This building holds 90 years of spiritual life," said Joyce Ashe, the treasurer of the synagogue from Rockaway Park who joined a few years ago and vows to help keep the doors open. "On Shabbat, you can feel their souls rise all around you."

HEADLINE: New Island Is Proposed For Harbor

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Senior environmental regulators offered a striking solution yesterday to the problem -- economically important if not often talked about -- of where to dump safely the muck that is regularly dredged to keep the harbor channels clear for shipping.
They want to build a two- or three-mile-long island in the harbor where sediments tainted with dioxin and other toxic materials could be disposed of. 
 Dredging is crucial to maintaining ports that generate tens of thousands of jobs and contribute $20 billion to the region's economy. But it has repeatedly bogged down in recent years because of lawsuits by environmental groups contending that the disposal of the contaminated materials in the ocean would harm fishing and tourism.
 
As in Chesapeake Bay
 Seeking to prevent a dredging dispute that might scare away shipping traffic, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and state regulators issued a series of proposals at a Manhattan news conference that included constructing a containment island in the harbor, similar to one in the Chesapeake Bay off Baltimore.
"The commitment from the states and the E.P.A. is to make the containment island happen," said Robert C. Shinn Jr., Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
The island would be built by fencing off part of the harbor by driving metal wedges into the ocean floor to create a corral and then pumping out the water inside and filling it with sediment. Both Governors Island and Ellis Island were constructed in part in a similar way, using material excavated during the construction of the subway tunnels, he said.
The plan, which would cost tens of millions of dollars, still faces regulatory and legislative hurdles that could take years to clear before construction could begin. Environmental groups, which have used the courts to block dredging projects, said they were concerned that officials were ignoring other ways of handling the 7 to 10 million cubic yards of sediment scooped from the harbor each year.
The containment island proposal appears to have grown more attractive in recent months as alternatives have dwindled. Finding a site on land for the sediment is difficult when many dumps are nearing capacity. Officials are still searching for a way to remove the contaminants that is not too costly.
The regulators, led by William J. Muszynski, the deputy regional administrator of the E.P.A., took pains to assure the public yesterday that if a containment island is built, it would not be an eyesore that would endanger public health.
 
Urgency of Removal
 They emphasized the urgency of removing the contaminated sediment from the harbor, saying that materials like dioxin, which is believed to have leaked into the harbor from a former Diamond Shamrock chemical plant upstream on the Passaic River, are considered far more dangerous in water than on land. That is because in water, these chemicals can quickly work their way up the food chain, absorbed by fish that will be eaten by humans.
"If this dirt was on the street anywhere in the country, it wouldn't be contaminated," said Col. Thomas A. York of the Army Corps of Engineers, referring to the sediment from the harbor. "Standards for soils that are above ground are much different than soils that are below the water's surface."
"At this point, in terms of long-terms solutions this is the best idea," he said later in an interview. "I just haven't seen anything else."
He said the corps in recent years had conducted several surveys of the harbor to identify the best place for a containment island, whether in Upper New York Bay, Newark Bay or elsewhere.
 
A Visit to Chesapeake Bay
 Mr. Shinn said he had been particularly impressed during a visit to the containment island built in the Chesapeake Bay from dredged sediment, saying that it was now covered with vegetation and used for docking by hundreds of boaters each weekend. That island is 2.5 miles long and one mile wide.
The dredging process, which insures that shipping channels are deep enough for the huge container ships that are now the dominant ocean carriers, began garnering attention in 1990 after the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sought a Federal permit to dredge Newark Bay. The Ports of Newark and Elizabeth receive most of the region's ships.
Environmentalists successfully delayed the procedure, arguing that the authorities could not be certain that tainted muck would stay put in the Mud Dump, an ocean disposal site six miles off Sandy Hook, N.J. A Federal judge eventually allowed the disposal of the sediment, but only after the Port Authority had lost some business to competing ports on the East Coast.
Yesterday, the state and Federal environmental regulators proposed that the Federal Government expand the Mud Dump and keep it open for a maximum of nine years to toxic material, while long-term solutions, including the containment island, are weighed. Another approach would be to put contaminated dredged sediment in pits burrowed into the floor of New York Harbor and then covered with many feet of clean sand.
While some environmental groups said they were pleased that the Mud Dump might eventually be closed to toxic material, they said regulators should not latch on to the idea of a containment island as a panacea. They said the government should also shut down the sources of the contaminants.
"In the long term, we are trying to focus the Federal and state agencies on technology to try to clean up the sediment," said Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, a coalition of environmental groups. "If you are going to spend $200 million to build an island, wouldn't it be better to invest that money in technology that produces jobs?"

HEADLINE: Post-Post Cold War

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 12

 BODY:
When President Kennedy visited West Berlin in 1963, the more than one million Berliners who turned out to greet him were the largest crowd he had ever seen. So large, in fact, that Mr. Kennedy said that when he left office he was going to leave his successor a sealed letter to be opened only when things got really bad at home. The letter would read, "Go to Germany."
Times have changed. What has been striking about Mr. Clinton's trip through Europe this week, including Berlin, is how muted the response has been. From Latvia, to Poland, to Italy, to Germany, the crowds have been substantial at times, but never huge, always embracing but hardly ecstatic. 
 The explanation, though, seems to have little to do with Mr. Clinton. It is much more a statement about this moment. To put it simply: the cold-war era, when cheering an American President in Berlin was as much an act of defiance against the Soviet Union as an expression of affection for the United States, is over.
 
The Euphoria Is Over
 And the euphoria of the immediate post-cold-war world is also over -- the days when an American President could whip a crowd into a frenzy by describing that land of milk and honey that lay ahead once Europe was free of the Communist yoke.
Today is the post-post-cold-war era, when the main questions being debated are: "Who takes out the garbage?" and "What have you done for me lately?"
As the cold war was coming to a close, those who lived under Communism in Eastern Europe had enormous expectations about what lay ahead, and they were eager to hear from an American leader about what it looked like on the other side of the hill.
Well, they are now on the other side of the hill. They know what it looks like, and it looks complicated. The view takes in Bosnia, free markets -- with all of their opportunities and uncertainties -- unemployment, inflation and a Western Europe that is hesitant to open its markets to their products or NATO to their armies.
Maybe that is why a young Russian-born Latvian named Paul reacted to President Clinton the way he did in Riga last week. Paul is a 25-year-old married to a Latvian woman, but was being denied Latvian citizenship because of his Russian ancestry. As he listened to Mr. Clinton extol the virtues of democracy for Latvia, Paul just shook his head and said, "I'm not buying it."
 
Leaders Seem to Have Shrunk
 What Mr. Clinton seems to have discovered on this trip is that in Europe he has inherited a moment when most of the heroes of the cold war have ridden off into the sunset, the credits have rolled and America is neither protecting Europe nor liberating it anymore.
In the eyes of the public, everyone seems to have shrunk three sizes. When aides told President Clinton that the approval rating of President Lech Walesa of Poland had sunk to 5 percent in Polish public opinion polls, Mr. Clinton responded, "Five percent? No one can be that low!"
Much has been made of the fact that because Mr. Clinton has focused his Presidency on domestic policy, he has deprived himself of one of the traditional sources of Presidential authority: foreign policy.
That is true enough. But what this latest tour underscores is that even if Mr. Clinton had chosen to concentrate more on foreign policy, it is questionable whether it would have given him the authority boost it has other presidents.
If Harry S. Truman and Dean Acheson were "present at the creation" of the cold-war world, Bill Clinton and Warren Christopher are "present at the adaptation" of the post-cold-war world. That is, they do not have the challenge, or the opportunity, of building institutions from scratch -- like NATO or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
They must try to adapt these institutions at a time when the Europeans have a much stronger say in what should go into them, when economic resources are scarce and when there is no Soviet enemy over the horizon to nudge the European allies into line. If the world is now safe for small wars, it is also safe for greater discord among the allies.
 
An Embarrassing Moment
 When Mr. Clinton offered a proposal at the Naples economic summit meeting to begin talking about the issues not dealt with in GATT -- like financial services -- he was spurned by the six other leaders, who thought the idea premature. The President was forced, rather embarrassingly, to take his proposal off the table.
Throughout this trip Mr. Clinton cajoled the Western Europeans to open their economies to more exports from Eastern Europe, as America has from Mexico. Otherwise, he said, capitalism will never take root in Poland or Ukraine. But the West European countries have soaring unemployment, and their leaders made clear to Mr. Clinton that they were reluctant to allow imports that could cost them a single job at home.
When President Kennedy went to West Berlin, the dollar was firm and strong. Today it fluctuates wildly against the German mark and Japanese yen. The era of fixed exchange rates is gone.
The cold-war world was characterized by governments dominating their economies, and no government was more dominant than America's. The post-cold-war world is characterized by free markets. It is the markets that dominate the governments today. It is a time when all governments can do less, not more.
 
Theme of Civil Courage
 No wonder, then, that the little-noticed theme that ran through Mr. Clinton's speeches here was a call for a new kind of courage, one that draws its energy from mundane daily acts of individuals -- a civil courage.
"The challenges our generation faces are different than those our parents faced," Mr. Clinton told the Polish Parliament. "They are problems that in many cases lack pressing drama. They require quiet and careful solutions. And if we meet them well, our reward will not be stunning moments of glory, but gradual and real improvements in the lives of our people.
"We must find the will to unite around these opportunities of peace, as previous generations have united against war's life-or-death threats and oppression's fatal grip. To the courage that enables men and women to drop behind enemy lines, face down rumbling tanks or advance freedom's cause underground, we must add a new civil courage -- the energy and optimism and patience to move forward through peaceful but hard and rapidly changing times."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Stay Flat Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Inflation at the producer level was nonexistent in June for the third straight month despite higher prices for energy, the Labor Department reported today.
This performance for the finished goods Producer Price Index -- items ready for sale to the final user -- was markedly better than most analysts had expected and seemed to provide the Federal Reserve more leeway to hold back on raising interest rates before what most still believe will be another rise in rates by mid-August. 
 At the same time, though, the continued slide of the dollar in currency markets suggested to some that the Fed might not need much more encouragement to come to its aid with higher rates. The Government is to issue reports for June later this week on consumer prices, retail sales and industrial operating capacity. The Consumer Price Index is scheduled to be reported on Wednesday.
 
Whiff of Inflation
 Today's report contained just a whiff of accelerated inflation, with prices rising more than in most recent months for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production. Earlier bursts of this kind, however, have not made their way through to final users, analysts said.
A separate report today, from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, found that the proportion of producers experiencing higher prices -- both for what they make and for what they buy -- held steady in June but that the share of producers saying they were getting lower prices climbed to 11 percent from 4 percent.
Yet another set of figures, published late in the day by the Federal Reserve Board, showed another robust rise in consumer installment debt -- the amount by which new borrowings on credit cards and at automobile dealers, among other things, exceed repayments.
The surge was $10.41 billion for May, an annual rate of 15.1 percent, that represented the 14th straight monthly increase. It was a slightly greater rise than April's, far surpassing expectations of a scaling down of consumer borrowing to match slower retail sales in the spring.
Automobile credit grew more slowly, the Fed reported, though economists have noted a shortage of popular models.
In revising the series back to the beginning of 1989, the Fed said there was now less strength in 1992 and more strength in 1993 and early 1994.
But the main attention went to the finished goods Producer Price Index, which was unchanged last month following one-tenth of 1 percent declines in April and May. Moreover, the so-called core rate that excludes the erratic food and energy components edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in June, the first decline since October.
"We keep waiting for these inflation ghosts, but they haven't yet shown up in the indexes," said John W. Mitchell, chief economist at U.S. Bancorp in Portland, Ore.
Word of unchanged producer prices touched off an early rally in the bond market, but then the dollar retreated, pulling bonds down. Still, Treasury bond prices managed to end the day higher.
 
Increase for Energy
 Inflation at the producer, or wholesale, level was also unchanged for the latest 12 months, though it picked up a bit in the first half of 1994 to show a 1.6 percent annual rate, partly reflecting a jump for energy.
"That's an exceptional performance," said Kenneth T. Mayland, chief financial economist at Keycorp in Cleveland, noting that the economy has been expanding for more than three years and that American industry is operating at nearly 84 percent of capacity.
Consumer foods, after falling nine-tenths of 1 percent in May, were unchanged last month despite a 32 percent jump for fresh and dry vegetables, an 8.2 percent rise for eggs and a faster rise for roasted coffee. Dairy products, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, shortening and pasta fell in price.
Energy, down 1 percent in May, climbed three-tenths of 1 percent last month as gasoline rose 1.5 percent and heating oil kept rising while residential natural gas fell 1.3 percent.
Elsewhere, tobacco products fell 2.7 percent and prices also turned down for women's and girls' clothing, cosmetics and leather footwear and increases slowed for passenger cars, light trucks, prescription drugs, periodicals and floor coverings.
The index for capital equipment rose slightly after increases of four-tenths of 1 percent in both April and May.
 
Intermediate Goods Rise
 Goods at the intermediate stage of production, like sacks of flour, moved up three-tenths of 1 percent last month, the most for more than a year except for a four-tenths of 1 percent rise in February. Construction materials rose 1 percent, including a 7.3 percent jump for softwood lumber.
Durable goods used in manufacturing surged 1.4 percent to lift the rate for the first six months of the year to 6.6 percent, more than double the pace of the second half of 1993, the report showed.
Nondurables used in manufacturing, like organic chemicals, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month and have nearly doubled this year their July-December 1993 pace.
So far, though, such pressures are not spreading. "Input costs are being 'engineered out' of product prices rather than passed through," Gordon Richards, economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said.
Among crude goods, like bushels of wheat, the rise was nine-tenths of 1 percent over all but with energy excluded there was a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Physical Traits in Teen-Agers Affect Later Income, Study Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 12

 BODY:
Obese teen-age girls and short teen-age boys make less money when they become young adults than others their age, a study of thousands of British youths has found.
The study does not indicate whether the culprit is discrimination or some internal factor like low self-esteem, but it suggests that appearance can have a big effect on the transition from school to work, the researchers said in the July issue of The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. 
 Research indicates that the same problems exist in the United States, they said.
"The effects are very important just as people enter the labor market," said a co-author, Dr. David G. Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. It looks as if that early stage is crucial, he said.
Dr. James D. Sargent, lead author of the study, said obesity needed to be prevented. But he said he was also concerned about eating disorders in women trying to achieve the thinness prized in Britain and the United States. Dr. Sargent is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.
Previous studies, including a recent survey of more than 10,000 Americans ages 16 to 24, found that overweight people, especially women, are far less likely to marry or make a comfortable living.
Dr. William H. Dietz, who led that study, said the new work provided "pretty compelling evidence that obesity is a major social handicap as well as physical handicap."
Dr. Dietz, director of clinical nutrition at New England Medical Center in Boston, said his study also found a correlation between lower male height and lower earnings. He said it mattered little whether discrimination or factors like low self-esteem were behind the findings, because both resulted from societal attitudes.
The new study looked at 12,537 people in England, Scotland and Wales, where all children born between March 3 and 9, 1958, were enrolled in a national child development study and have been tracked ever since.
The study found that girls in the heaviest 10 percent of their age group at age 16 earned 7.4 percent less than their non-obese peers by the time they reached 23; and that those in the heaviest 1 percent earned 11.4 percent less at age 23.
The disadvantage in earnings persisted even if obese girls had trimmed down by age 23, the researchers found.
For boys, obesity did not appear to affect earnings, but height did. For every four inches less height at age 16, boys earned 2 percent less at age 23, the researchers found.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: THE HEARING;
TAKING INITIATIVE, NOMINEE DEFENDS CONDUCT AS JUDGE

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Judge Stephen G. Breyer, President Clinton's Supreme Court nominee, moved swiftly today to defend himself against assertions that he might have acted improperly by ruling on pollution cases while he was an investor in an insurance syndicate facing heavy losses from pollution lawsuits.
In his first day of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is considering his nomination, Judge Breyer said he was confident that his participation in eight pollution cases as a Federal appeals court judge violated no laws or judicial ethics guidelines. 
 "There is nothing more important to me than my integrity," said Judge Breyer, who is expected to be confirmed easily despite this issue.
Nonetheless, Judge Breyer, who is the chief judge of Federal Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, said he would do whatever he could to end his association quickly with the Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate. But that would probably be very costly and still might not guarantee that he would be free of future liability.
He also told the committee that he did not oppose the death penalty and believed that a woman had a constitutional right to an abortion. He refused, however, to discuss details of how he would interpret specific cases involving those issues that might come before the Court. [Excerpts, page A16.]
Judge Breyer showed his eagerness to address critics when he included the remarks about his Lloyd's investment in a quickly added postscript to his prepared opening statement -- before anyone even asked him about it.
"I know that -- and this is important to me -- that in recent weeks there have been questions raised about the ethical standard that I applied in sitting on certain environmental cases in the First Circuit at a time when I had an investment, an insurance investment, in Lloyd's," he said.
"I have reviewed those cases again, and the judicial recusal statute, and I personally am confident that my sitting in those cases did not present any conflict of interest."
Although the Lloyd's issue was the most pointed one raised today, Judge Breyer was also asked about some emotion-laden legal issues that dominated Supreme Court debate in recent years. He said, for example, that he did not automatically oppose the death penalty, as did Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the man he would replace. But he would not discuss specific circumstances in which he might limit its application.
He noted Justice Blackmun's announcement earlier this year, his 24th year on the Court, that he could no longer vote to approve the death penalty under any circumstances. "I have no such personal view in regard to the death penalty," Judge Breyer told Senator Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican. "The Supreme Court has considered that matter for quite a long time in a large number of cases."
 
Affirmation of Roe v. Wade
 Then, in what seemed a mild criticism of Justice Blackmun, Judge Breyer said he believed that if a justice had strong personal views on an issue as important as the death penalty "perhaps he should recuse himself."
On abortion, he told Senator Thurmond that the right to abortion was decided 21 years ago in Roe v. Wade and was reaffirmed two years ago in a case from Pennsylvania, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. "That is the law," he said.
As to how far a state may go in restricting abortions, he added, "I don't think I should go into those."
His matter-of-fact answers on both subjects demonstrated how the two issues have receded as centerpieces of the debate over the Supreme Court.
Indeed, most of Judge Breyer's answers involved more esoteric legal issues related to his expertise in government regulation. In a colloquy with Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee, Judge Breyer said he believed a judge should show great deference to regulations drafted by Federal agencies.
Senator Biden noted that Judge Breyer has written extensively claiming that Federal agencies waste huge amounts of money because of distorted priorities. For example, he has written about a case in which another court struck down the Environmental Protection Agency's ban on asbestos as costly and inefficient.
Senator Biden asked if Judge Breyer agreed that even if agencies may be wasting money, it would be improper for courts to overrule them because of some economic analysis. "Absolutely, absolutely," came the response. Judge Breyer said he used the asbestos case as an illustration "that it isn't a very good idea for courts to get involved in that decision. It's a decision for Congress to make."
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat and the only committee member to raise the Lloyd's issue today, said he would question Judge Breyer closely about any possible conflict on Wednesday.
The main focus of this query is Judge Breyer's investment in a 1985 syndicate of Lloyd's, which is facing significant losses because it had insured parties against losses from asbestos and insurance lawsuits.
 
A Tricky Investment
 Because of his Lloyd's investment, Judge Breyer declined to participate in any asbestos case but he did issue opinions in eight cases involving the Superfund, the law enacted by Congress providing money to cleanup toxic waste sites. Over his years on the bench, Judge Breyer has been an investor in dozens of syndicates formed by Lloyd's, but the 1985 syndicate is apparently the only one that remains open with a potential for ever greater losses.
Being an investor in a Lloyd's syndicate was once considered a profitable investment favored by wealthy people who could count on great profits in exchange for pledging all their assets to cover any losses. But in recent years, it has proved to be a highly risky investment; many people have had their fortunes wiped out.
Judge Breyer emphasized today that he thought it was a fair issue for his critics to raise and suggested that he would regard the ethics discussion as a lesson he would use to make him more sensitive.
He said he intended to ask the managers of his syndicate, Merrett 418, to expedite the termination of his relationship with Lloyd's. But some experts said that could be extremely difficult, if not impossible.
White House officials said that Judge Breyer, might try to buy some reinsurance, that is he could pay someone handsomely to agree to cover his future losses. Judge Breyer has listed his net worth at more than $8 million, largely in stocks, mutual funds and four residences around the world, some of it inherited from his wife's family. If confirmed he would be the Court's wealthiest member.
But Richard Rosenblatt, a California investor in Lloyd's and head of a group of hundreds of American investors in Lloyd's syndicates who are afraid of being wiped out, said it could cost Judge Breyer more than $1 million to insure himself against his share of the syndicate's losses. And even that, Mr. Rosenblatt said, is no guarantee, because if the reinsurer goes broke, Judge Breyer still remains liable as the responsible investor.
At the end of the day, Senator Biden said, "I don't see anything, from the esoteric to the ethical, that has caused any red flags to go up."
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the committee's ranking Republican, agreed, saying, "I believe he will be confirmed."

HEADLINE: Tweaking the Captains of Industry in Prime Time

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN 

 BODY:
Michael Moore, the counterculture film maker who skewered General Motors and its chairman in the mordantly humorous "Roger and Me," is at it again -- and this time his camera lens has widened to include all of Corporate America.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Moore, accompanied by a television film crew, stood outside I.B.M.'s building in Manhattan, his bullhorn aimed toward the office of Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chief executive. 
 "Mr. Gerstner," boomed Mr. Moore's voice, "come down. This is 'The C.E.O. Challenge.' Come down. We are unarmed. All we want is to find out if you can format a floppy diskette."
 
Elusive Prey
 Mr. Gerstner can indeed format a diskette, according to an I.B.M. spokesman, but he was not about to do it for Mr. Moore, who wanted the demonstration for his new television show on NBC.
Mr. Gerstner wasn't alone. More than 60 corporations have turned down Mr. Moore's request to film their bosses demonstrating their knowledge of a product their company makes. Only Alex Trotman, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, agreed to play along, changing the oil on a Ford Explorer for Mr. Moore.
"C.E.O. Challenge" is but one way in which Mr. Moore will be applying to the world of business an irreverent variation on the serious television news magazines descended from "60 Minutes." Though the new show, "TV Nation," is not being presented as legitimate journalism, it tries to go beyond mere entertainment. One goal is to make people think about the way American companies operate.
Michael Moore's perspective is decidedly working class, and the man makes no pretense at fairness or balance. Someone like that makes network executives and lawyers nervous. Which is why Mr. Moore, who is 40, was taken aback when NBC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, offered to broadcast seven episodes of his new show.
"At first I thought one of those earthquakes shook something loose in Burbank," said Mr. Moore, whose first show will be broadcast next Tuesday evening. "I asked them if they had the right Michael Moore. I was afraid they thought I was Roger Moore or Dudley Moore."
An NBC spokesman, Ed Harrison, said the show was a response to criticism that television lacked originality.
Most episodes of "TV Nation" will consist of five short humorous films, often involving business or the economy. In one segment Mr. Moore "fires" his staff and tries to produce his show in Mexico to dramatize the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In another he hires a lobbyist in Washington to promote legislation giving his employees a 50 percent tax cut.
The show also visited Avon ladies who ply their trade by canoe along the Amazon River in Brazil. Not quite stated is the opinion that American capitalism pushes its way into remote corners of the world with products of questionable necessity. "There are women who make the equivalent of $60 a week spending $40 on some anti-aging cream," said Kathleen Glynn, the show's producer.
 
Tests for Executives

 
 The "C.E.O. Challenge" segment, to be broadcast within a few weeks of the program's first episode, was conceived to show that executives who run America's corporations often have little firsthand knowledge of their companies' products, operations or customers.
The executives Mr. Moore approached were not exactly accommodating. Ralph Lauren didn't show up to sew the hem of a shirt. Reuben Mark of Colgate-Palmolive would not roll up his sleeves and demonstrate his dishwashing detergent. Jack Welch was too busy to screw in a G.E. light bulb. Fortunately for Mr. Moore, "C.E.O. Challenge" is funnier when executives or their spokesmen try to flee Mr. Moore.
This is not the first time Mr. Moore has explored the theme of management isolation. "Roger and Me," his 1989 documentary, chronicled the effects of G.M. factory shutdowns on the people of Flint, Mich., his hometown. Its comic energy derived from Mr. Moore's futile attempt to engage Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman, in an interview about layoffs and shutdowns. What came through was Mr. Smith's seeming detachment from the effects the G.M. decisions had on people's lives.
"Roger and Me," which was nominated for an Academy Award, was criticized by G.M. and others as an unfair attack on a company trying to streamline itself in the face of foreign competition.
 
A Celebrated Oil Change

 
 Al Chambers, a Ford public relations man, recalls how G.M. was made to look ridiculous by "Roger and Me." But Ford itself didn't look so good when Mr. Trotman, its chairman, disclosed last October that he did not own a car. Thus, when Mr. Moore's challenge landed, Mr. Chambers and Ford were not inclined to kiss it off.
The Ford sequence will show Mr. Moore beckoning with his bullhorn in front of Ford headquarters, tempting Mr. Trotman with his notion of executive blandishments: a Scotch on the rocks and cigars. Mr. Trotman appears and, to the strains of the theme from "Rocky," goes to work on the Explorer. Afterward, Mr. Moore awards him a golden putter and an office putting green.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Federal cleanup funds may aid the greening of Tetra Tech.

BYLINE: By John Holusha 

 BODY:
THE fortunes of environmental companies are closely linked to the performance of the economy. When the economy falters, fewer products are made and thrown out, depriving haul-and-dump companies of raw material.
Similarly, when resources are scarce, even mandatory cleanups slow down, pinching the engineering and consulting companies that investigate and analyze sites, as well as the companies that do the actual cleaning. But one customer is not likely to be at a severe loss for funds: the Federal Government. Several analysts have identified Tetra Tech Inc. of Pasadena, Calif., as an engineering and consulting company poised to take advantage of Government business. 
 Both the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy face a number of large cleanups, and each is expected to spend $6 billion a year for the rest of the decade. The Defense Department is closing unneeded military bases and must remove chemicals and other types of contamination before the land can be turned over for civilian use. The Energy Department must deal with the radioactive waste of the early decades of the nuclear era.
Tetra Tech, a small, fast-growing company, specializes in the analysis of complex ground and surface water contamination problems. Its stock symbol is, appropriately, WATR. (It is not related to Tetra Technologies, a Texas company.)
"Tetra Tech is part of a small group of companies that have been very successful over the last 12 to 18 months," said Andrew M. Barish of Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco. Other companies in that group include Rust International and the Ohm Corporation.
Speaking of Tetra Tech, Mr. Barish said, "They have won a bunch of contracts that should put them in a good position for the next few years."
Winning contracts early in the cleanup program was important, Mr. Barish said, because the Government agencies are likely to continue working with companies with which they have already had productive relations. "If you have not been successful by now, you are likely to be left out for the next few years," he said.
Jeffrey Robins of Gruntal & Company in New York said Tetra Tech had reasonably good civilian prospects as well. He added that the company's recent acquisition of Simon Hydro-Search, a Colorado-based water management concern, would give it an array of private sector clients to balance out its Government business.
"Hydro-Search has important business relationships with aerospace and defense companies, mining companies, petroleum drillers and manufacturing companies, which will enhance Tetra Tech's corporate client roster," he said in a recent report.
Mr. Robins recently increased his estimates of the company's earnings in the current fiscal year, which ends in September, to 80 cents a share, up from 64 cents a year earlier. He expects earnings of $1 a share for the 1995 fiscal year. Mr. Barish has the same estimate for 1994 but is a little less optimistic about 1995, estimating 95 cents a share.
The earnings estimates are based on rapidly rising revenues; Mr. Barish forecasts they will increase to $112 million by the end of 1995 from $65.63 million in 1992.
Tetra Tech is a small-capitalization stock, and it last traded at $19, down from a high of $23 earlier this year. Both analysts are predicting the price will move into the mid $20's within a year.
There is, of course, a possibility that the Energy and Defense Departments will not move so quickly as expected on the cleanups, but that becomes less likely as early phases of the projects are completed, and the agencies gain confidence in their contractors.

HEADLINE: PAYING FOR NEW JERSEY'S SCHOOLS;
Excerpts From Court Ruling Ordering Parity in New Jersey School Funding

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the New Jersey Supreme Court's unanimous ruling yesterday on the state's system of financing public education.
We affirm the judgment of the Chancery Division declaring unconstitutional the Quality Education Act (the act or QEA), N.J.S.A. 18A:7D-1 to -37. Our decision is based on the act's failure to assure parity of regular education expenditures between the special-needs districts and the more affluent districts. The state informs us that it does not anticipate that the act in its present form will continue to control financing of public education. 
 We retain jurisdiction. We decline to enter any orders now. The substantial increase in state aid to the 30 special-needs districts (approximately $700 million) since our opinion Abbott v. Burke, 119 N.J. 287 (1990), compared to the wealthier districts (no increase), and the consequent change in the relative disparity of expenditures for regular education between the two (average per-pupil expenditures in the special-needs districts before QEA were either approximately 70 percent or 75 percent of that in the richer districts and are now approximately 84 percent) constitute, within a framework of commitment to parity, a constitutionally legitimate response of the other branches of government to our ruling in that case, given all the circumstances.
We will not intervene, except as noted below, if substantial equivalence of the special-needs districts and the wealthier districts in expenditures per pupil for regular education is achieved for school year 1997-1998 along with provision for the special educational needs of students in those special-needs districts. That school year is selected in view of the current statute requiring compliance by an even earlier school year, 1995-1996, and in conformance with plaintiffs' suggested timetable calling for compliance by 1997-1998.
If movement towards that end at any time suggests less than a reasonable likelihood of achieving compliance by 1997-1998, we will entertain applications for relief from any party to this action. More specifically, if the relative disparity, now at 16 percent, is not further addressed in both school years 1995-1996 and 1996-1997, we will hear such applications. Furthermore, if a law assuring such substantial equivalence, approximating 100 percent, for school year 1997-1998 and providing as well for special educational needs, is not adapted by September 1996, we will consider applications for relief.
 
Why the Formula Didn't Work
 Although the specific mathematical formulas involved in calculating the spending and funding provisions of the QEA are extraordinarily complex, the basic legislative design is simple and straightforward, as are the reasons why QEA failed to assure and achieve parity. The Legislature declared as its objective that the QEA formula would "provide that by the 1995-1996 school year, the per-pupil expenditures in the poorer urban districts will be substantially equal to those in the wealthy suburban districts." N.J.S.A 18A:7D-2b(5). To achieve that goal, the Legislature addressed both spending and funding for special-needs districts. Although the QEA authorized, but did not compel, the special-needs districts to spend enough each year to achieve parity by the 1995-1996 school year, the act did not guarantee funding sufficient to pay for the authorized level of spending.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Although the state's expert witness acknowledged at trial that parity between the special-needs districts and the richer districts was "mathematically" possible under the QEA, he conceded that "without the assurance of the Governor recommending an [increase in] the special-needs weight. . . there is no specific assurance that parity would be achieved. . . ." As noted, the special-needs weight -- which was the statutory mechanism designed to increase foundation aid for the special-needs districts -- has never been increased. Because the QEA's design for achieving parity depends fundamentally on the discretionary action of the executive and legislative branches to increase the special-needs weight, which in turn would increase the maximum foundation budget and the amount of foundation aid in the special needs districts to the levels required for parity, the statute fails to guarantee adequate funding for those districts. Accordingly, the conclusion is unavoidable that the QEA does not comply with Abbott's mandate that the required level of funding for the special-needs districts "cannot be allowed to depend on the ability of local school districts to tax. . . [and] must be guaranteed and mandated by the State. . . . " 119 N.J. at 295. We so hold.
 
Special Educational Needs
 Based on the trial record, the inference is compelling that no mechanism presently is in place to control, regulate or monitor the uses of additional funding made available to the special-needs districts pursuant to Abbott. Although the QEA required each special-needs district to establish an educational improvement plan, to be approved by the Commissioner [of Education], and directed the Commissioner to verify that each district's budget had adequate resources to implement the plan, N.J.S.A. 18A:7D-32, no evidence in the record suggests any correlation between the additional funding received by the special-needs districts and the implementation of their respective educational-improvement plans.

 	 	 		. . .	 	But recognizing the legitimate public concerns that the added funding directly benefit the children in the special-needs districts, and the state's argument that funding should not be increased at a rate faster than the districts can constructively absorb and allocate, we find inescapable the conclusion that the Legislature or the department should insure that the uses of the additional funding available to the special-needs districts are supervised and regulated. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	The parties' agreement on the question of special educational needs, consistent with the Court's holding in Abbott and reiterated here, confirms that students in the special-needs districts have distinct and specific requirements for supplemental educational and educationally related programs and services that are unique to those students, not required in wealthier districts, and that represent an educational cost not included within the amounts expended for regular education.
The primary concern, the goal, of the department, the Legislature and indeed the public, is the actual achievement of educational success in the special-needs districts. The record before us makes it clear that success cannot be expected to be realized unless the department and the Commissioner identify and implement the special supplemental programs and services that the children in these districts require. Without them, they will not have a fair chance to achieve that success. The money mandated by Abbott cannot bridge the gap without significant intervention in the form of special programs and services targeted to the needs of these disadvantaged students.
 
For Students and for Society
 We reaffirm our holding in Abbott, supra. For these special-needs districts, a thorough and efficient education -- one that will enable their students to function effectively in the same society with their richer peers both as citizens and as competitors in the labor market -- is an education that is the substantial equivalent of that afforded in the richer districts. Those students in the special-needs districts, given their educational disadvantages and the circumstances of their environment, will not be able to function effectively as citizens in that society, will not be able to fairly compete as workers. They are entitled at least to the chance of doing so, and without an equal educational opportunity, they will not have that chance. Their situation in society is one of extreme disadvantage; the state must not compound it by providing an inferior education. It is the state and only the state that is responsible for this educational disparity, and only the state can correct it. Through its laws, a system of education exists that is not thorough and efficient for these students in the special-needs districts. The state must remedy that failing.
As we noted in Abbott, equality of money does not assure equality of education. Nor does the grant of additional funds assure that they will be well spent. The responsibility for substantive education is squarely and completely committed to the state; delegation of any part of the educational function to school districts does not dilute that state responsibility at all. This Court will not, and should not, assume any part of that responsibility. While our power is not limited to a money remedy, Abbott, supra, 119 N.J. at 388, given the state's record, and its strong commitment to public education, it would be an abuse of judicial power for this Court to assume the role assigned by law to the Commissioner and department. More than that, it would be extremely unwise: we are simply not equipped for such a role, nor capable of it. We will do only that which we are capable of doing, we will assure the opportunity for this substantially equivalent education by ordering substantially equivalent funding: it is up to the state to assure that the money is spent well and not wasted.
 
'Responsibility of State'
 In answer to the claim that even with additional funding, the special-needs districts still would not satisfy the thorough and efficient test, we noted they were "entitled to pass or fail with at least the same amount of money as their competitors"; to the claim that even with more money "these students simply cannot make it," we said they should be given a chance, that they should not be given less because more will not help, and that if it is true that their needs cannot be fully met, that doesn't mean that their needs should not be met at all. We noted that "like other states, we undoubtedly have some 'uneducable' students, but in New Jersey there is no such thing as an uneducable district, not under our Constitution." And we underlined the clear and absolute responsibility of the state for both the problem and its solution, noting that all of the money supports education -- all of it public money whether the taxes are local or state -- is authorized and controlled in terms of its source, amount, distribution and use by the state, and that all of the students are citizens of the state, no less citizens in the special-needs districts than in the richer districts, all entitled to be treated equally, to begin at the same starting line.
We assume no reminder is needed of the plight of these students, whose education and lives are at stake. We repeat the reminder, however, that also at stake is the future of the state and the rest of its citizens:
While the constitutional measure of the educational deficiency is its impact on the lives of these students, we are also aware of its potential impact on the entire state and its economy -- not only on its social and cultural fabric, but on its material well-being, on its jobs, industry and business. Economists and business leaders say that our state's economic well-being is dependent on more skilled workers, technically proficient workers, literate and well-educated citizens. And they point to the urban poor as an integral part of our future economic strength. In short, they urge the state to go about the business of substantially improving the education of the very subjects of this litigation, the students in poorer urban districts. So it is not just that their future depends on the state, the state's future depends on them. That part of the constitutional standard requiring an education that will enable the urban poor to compete in the marketplace, to take their fair share of leadership and professional positions, assumes a new significance.
In addition to the impact of the constitutional failure on our economy, we noted the unmistakable further impact of the fact that soon one-third of our citizens will be black or Hispanic, many of them undereducated, isolated in a separate culture, affected by despair, sometimes bitterness and hostility, constituting a large part of society that is disintegrating, which disintegration will inevitably affect the rest of society. We noted that "(e)veryone's future is at stake, and not just the poor's. Certainly the urban poor need more than education, but it is hard to believe that their isolation and society's division can be reversed without it."
Our ultimate constitutional focus, however, must remain on the students:
This record proves what all suspect: that if the children of poorer districts went to school today in richer ones, educationally they would be a lot better off. Everything in this record confirms what we know: they need that advantage much more than the other children. And what everyone knows is that -- as children -- the only reason they do not get that advantage is that they were born in a poor district. For while we have underlined the impact of the constitutional deficiency on our state, its impact on these children is far more important. They face, through no fault of their own, a life of poverty and isolation that most of us cannot begin to understand or appreciate.

HEADLINE: The Guard Takes On The Gangs

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R.

 BODY:
One day just before dawn a year ago, 500 police officers and National Guard troops descended on Las Gladiolas public housing project here, searching apartments, confiscating drugs and weapons, and making arrests.
Afterward, nearly 200 of them stayed on. They closed off a back entrance to the four buildings in the fenced-in project and built a bulletproof guard house with gates to control access to the property. Three months later, the Guard and most of the police officers withdrew, but 18 officers remained, quartered at a mini-station house. 
 Tenants say lives at Las Gladiolas changed drastically, beneficiaries of a Puerto Rican government crackdown that relies partly on the precedent-setting routine use of the National Guard to help fight crime in housing developments. Las Gladiolas, long known for its shootouts and drive-in drug transactions, the place where even ambulance and firefighting crews had refused to venture in, suddenly became one whose residents could venture out.
"Before, all you saw were lines of cars and people with arms," said Adela de Leon, the 43-year-old president of a new tenants council. "You don't see that anymore. We're more at peace."
 
Success and Reservations
 The experience of Ms. de Leon and her neighbors is mirrored by that of residents at other housing projects on the island. The authorities say that in the year since Puerto Rico decided to use the Guard to help the police seize control of residential developments rife with drug dealing, the crime rate has been cut by more than half in the 45 public projects and 5 private developments where the strategy has been applied.
Not that everyone is entirely sold on the effort, a showcase of Gov. Pedro Rossello's anti-crime program, Mano Dura, which is Spanish for Stern Hand. In addition to the complaints of civil rights lawyers that the crackdown has frequently been characterized by illegal searches and other transgressions, some critics remain unconvinced that the safer environment it has yielded will prove lasting or widespread.
For one thing, while the authorities' island-wide statistics show a sharp drop in crime as a whole during the last year -- rape, for instance, is down by 21.4 percent -- murder has risen, by 2.1 percent. The increase is attributed to drug gangs that, having been displaced from housing projects where the Guard has intervened, now find themselves fighting for control of new areas.
Further, the Guard typically remains at a raided project only two months or so, and there is already some evidence that once the soldiers move out, crime begins to move back in.
 
A First for the Military
 The introduction of Governor Rossello's anti-crime strategy drew immediate and vast attention last year because it marked the first time that American military units had been routinely deployed to help the police fight crime. Americans have been generally resistant to using the military for domestic police work -- when Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly of Washington suggested to President Clinton that the Guard could join anti-crime efforts in her city, the idea went nowhere -- and some of those reservations have been reflected here.
Civil rights lawyers say that although they have not yet filed lawsuits stemming from the joint Guard-police crackdown, they have received many complaints of abuse. And the legal issues, they say, intensify the social ones.
Judith Berkan, president of the Human Rights Commission of the Puerto Rican Bar Association, says the Guard's occupation of poor residential areas serves only to deepen class divisions. "You get people accustomed to state intervention and violation of civil rights," she said.
But if the critics refer to the program as the "militarization" of the housing projects, the Governor calls it their "liberation."
"What gives me the most satisfaction is that the civil rights of those who lived under the threat of drug trafficking have been re-established," Mr. Rossello said in an interview. "They've been liberated."
 
Praise From Washington
 The strategy, which at any given time involves as many as 300 of the island's 11,500 National Guard troops, has won praise from Federal officials who have followed it.
One of those officials, Lee P. Brown, the Director of National Drug Control Policy, visited some of the projects in May and said he believed that the crackdown had succeeded so far. "You break the link between the drug dealers and the drug consumers," Mr. Brown said in an interview. "The challenge is to keep them running, hopefully into the ocean."
The strategy entails three phases. First comes the raid. Then work crews build security fences and spruce up the property. Finally, representatives of 16 Puerto Rican government service agencies, collectively called the Quality of Life Congress, move in to address drug-spawning social problems like unemployment, poor heath care and lack of recreational programs.
Mr. Rossello said that when the program began, about half of the 250,000 tenants in Puerto Rico's 332 public housing projects lived "under the control of drug traffickers."
Now crime in the projects has dropped by more than 50 percent in only a year, says Police Superintendent Pedro A. Toledo; the Governor's office puts the figure at 85 percent. Either way, a drastic solution appears to have brought a dramatic result.
 
A Tinge of Disenchantment
 Still, concern lingers as to how long that result will last. Some tenants complain that the raids have been followed by laxity on the part of law-enforcement officials and social service agencies alike. Rafael Albarran, a political science professor at the University of Puerto Rico, said that in a series of surveys and interviews at 10 of the raided projects, many tenants told him and his students that some drug dealing continued, although more discreetly.
Several critics, like Representative David Noriega of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, the minority whip in the island's House of Representatives, say a greater emphasis on social programs and even some form of drug legalization would be better in the long run than the course Mr. Rossello has chosen.
But the Governor says he has just begun: He has committed about $75 million a year to his program through 1996, when his first term ends.
His administration acknowledges a need for diligent follow-through. Housing Secretary Carlos J. Vivoni says the challenge is to offer the projects' tenants, most of whom depend on welfare benefits, opportunities for education, jobs and "rebuilding" their communities.
"Our success," Mr. Vivoni said, "will depend on the continued importance subsequent administrations give the effort, and the level of involvement and commitment by the residents. If the residents don't become owners of their environment, the communities will rot again."

HEADLINE: Nations Envied for Schools Share Americans' Worries

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, July 12

 BODY:
When American officials embarked on efforts to improve public education a decade ago, the campaign was accompanied by hand-wringing over the well-run, results-oriented school systems of other nations. Why, American analysts asked, are schools in other countries seemingly better off than those in the United States?
The answer is that they are not, as American officials discovered in a rare meeting with high-ranking education leaders from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and seven other Pacific Rim nations here. The meeting ended over the weekend, but not before the foreign educators lamented problems that, to hard-pressed United States representatives, sounded reassuringly familiar. Students need to achieve at higher levels. they said; teacher training needs improvement; vocational education and school-to-work transition programs fall short, and the need for them will only grow. Finally, they said, there is too little money to overhaul schools. 
 "We're all in the same boat," said Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit education research and policy organization based in Denver that was the host for the conference. "We're all moving toward each other, and I see that accelerating."
Even policy solutions instituted in Australia and Taiwan, including a commitment to strengthening student performance in math and science, sound strikingly similar to the eight goals in President Clinton's legislation, titled Education 2000, which was approved earlier this year.
 
Economy Fuels Convergence
 A broad spectrum of education officials here said this unity of purpose, if not approach, was being fueled by a world economy increasingly interdependent, competitive and service oriented. Without a skilled work force that can produce goods and, particularly, services that keep pace with the competition, they said, their nations will falter. Educational systems must be retooled to yield a work force that is multilingual, adept with computers and technology and able to engage in problem solving and other "higher-order" thinking skills.
Nowhere were common concerns more evident than in vocational education and school-to-work transition programs. Virtually every nation -- even those thought to possess highly skilled work forces -- said their programs, which resemble those in the United States, were failing students and, ultimately, their nation's needs.
South Korean and Japanese officials, for example, said that as in the United States, too few students enrolled in vocational education programs, primarily because parents preferred that their children enter college, not the work force after graduating from high school. "Parents don't want their children attending technical colleges," said Wang-Bok Kim, of South Korea's Ministry of Education. And inadequate financing has left most vocational programs without the state-of-the-art, computerized equipment needed to train the next generation of workers.
Indeed, Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said that in the United States, which has long struggled to upgrade and update job training, only Oregon and Wisconsin had produced work-to-school transition programs that aggressively addressed students' needs by allowing 10th graders to pursue job-training over college preparation and by incorporating advanced technology, visits to workplaces and business executives as instructors in those programs.
 
Deep Divisions Masked
 Such similar concerns and experiences masked deep international divisions over educational approaches, said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in Princeton, N.J. But they are differences, he and others suggested, from which all could learn.
Japanese students, for example, outperform American students in math and science because, Japanese officials here said, their schools are more structured and focus on drill and practice. But the officials acknowledged that educational rigidity bred a lack of creativity, an area in which American students excelled.
And the ability to develop new, innovative ideas, the representatives from Japan and other Asian countries said, is critical in service economies. "The East tends to be very traditional, very rigid," said Lee Yock Suan, the Minister of Education for Singapore. "In the West, there is a lot of emphasis on creativity, but not enough structure."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Little Changed After Losses Early in Day

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar cut its early losses late yesterday to end little changed against other leading currencies. Earlier in the day, the dollar fell to a new low against the yen for the third consecutive session.
The dollar fell sharply in early New York trading after the release of the Labor Department's report on producer prices. The absence of inflation at the producer level was seen as relieving the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon. Many currency traders contend that a sharp increase in interest rates is needed to stabilize the dollar. 
 But the report that producer prices were unchanged in June from May was good news for the Treasury securities market, attracting money into notes and bonds. This, in turn, helped shore up the dollar.
 The dollar was quoted at 1.5280 German marks, unchanged from Monday's quote in New York. Earlier in London, the dollar settled at 1.5162 marks, down from 1.5382 on Monday. The dollar posted one of its sharpest one-day drops on Monday.
The dollar edged down to 97.40 yen, from 97.73 yen on Monday. Earlier, the dollar had fallen to a new intraday trading low of 96.60 yen, down from the previous record of 96.96 yen set on Monday. In Tokyo, the dollar settled at 97.20.
The British pound fell to $1.5685 in New York, from $1.5725 on Monday.
In other currency trading, the dollar rose to 1.2895 Swiss francs, from 1.2890. But it was at 5.2450 French francs, down from 5.2525; 1.3848 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3868, and 1,517 Italian lire, down from 1,525.
"The dollar continues to have a very negative tone," said Tom Benfer, a director at the Bank of Mon-treal. "The negative psychology about the dollar is still very strong in the market and we are wondering what is the development that will break that negative psychology."
The bearish sentiment on the dollar emerged after the Clinton Administration was seen as favoring a strong yen to put pressure on Japan to open up its markets to foreign products.
The Secretary of Commerce, Ronald H. Brown, reiterated yesterday that the Clinton Administration would continue "its aggressive, pro-active policy of doing everything we can to open those markets."
Talks between the United States and Japan are continuing, but Mr. Brown acknowledged that the Administration could not report "significant progress."
Mr. Benfer of the Bank of Montreal said, "Certainly if there is a trade agreement with Japan, even on one issue, this would be considered very positive for dollar-yen."

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
Judge Seeks N.B.A. Settlement

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
A Federal judge, wielding a prickly verbal scepter, warned the National Basketball Association and the players' union yesterday to settle their simmering labor impasse. He said that if they did not, he would make a decision that would please no one.
"All this should have been resolved at collective bargaining," United States District Court Judge Kevin Duffy said. "No two ways about it. Neither side is particularly well served by litigation." 
 At the conclusion of yesterday's contentious one-day trial in Manhattan Federal Court, Duffy ordered that each side submit final documents by noon today, but he did not say when he would actually rule. "Unless you want me meddling in your labor negotiations, you should go out and get it fixed now," Duffy said.
Jeffrey Mishkin, an N.B.A. lawyer, said: "Clearly, he was telling us to bargain it out. But whatever he decides, he can't write us a new collective bargaining agreement." Mishkin said that no talks with the union were scheduled.
The league sued the National Basketball Players Association last month to guarantee the continuation of the terms of their labor agreement, which expired June 23, until a new deal was negotiated. The union obtained a temporary restraining order last week that barred teams from signing players to new contracts.
 
Antitrust Law Is at Issue
 The heart of the dispute is whether the expiration of the agreement subjects the impasse to antitrust law. The league says no, but the union charges that three elements of past agreements it wants to end -- the revenue sharing/salary cap system, the college draft and teams' right of first refusal in the signing of free agents -- violate antitrust law.
The trial featured Duffy jousting with lawyers, especially Frank Rothman, one of the league's lawyers, who unsuccessfully defended the National Football League in its antitrust fight against the United States Football League. He also jousted with the N.B.A.'s commissioner, David J. Stern.
Early on, Duffy suggested that Rothman was engaged in delaying tactics. "Do you want to spend two and a half years on this, like the last one?" Duffy, asked, referring to the lengthy N.F.L. case.
"Your honor, I lost $1," Rothman said, referring to the fact that the jury awarded the U.S.F.L. damages of only $1.
"And all the attorney's fees, not a small matter," Duffy said.
 
League's Motives Questioned
 Duffy asked about the league's motives in seeking a judgment that the labor dispute was not an antitrust matter.
"Why not let it go to collective bargaining?" Duffy asked.
"I wanted to, but we were threatened with antitrust litigation," Rothman said, "We brought declaratory action. . . ."
"To diddle around for two and a half years," Duffy interjected. "You'd like the judge of the court to become czar of the N.B.A?"
At that, Stern smiled. Said Rothman: "It's the last thing we want."
 
Testimony From Grantham
 Charles Grantham, executive director of the players association, testified that the union accepted the salary cap, revenue-sharing and the draft in labor agreements reached in 1983 and 1988 as economic necessities. But by 1990, he said, "We decided the cap and the draft restricted movement of players, and they had to be ended."
Roger Noll, a Stanford economist, testified that the salary cap does not foster competitive balance in the league.
"Nearly all the teams are at the cap, and it's become anticompetitive," Noll said.
The contention that many teams were paying players all the money they are able to under the cap seemed to unsettle Duffy.
"The players are getting all the money they're promised and therefore it's anticompetitive?" he asked Noll. Yes, Noll said, "it becomes anticompetitive when a majority of the teams are at the cap."
A second economic expert called by the union, William Landes, was told to leave the jury box by Duffy when his background revealed no testimony or writings about sports. "Step down!" the judge ordered.
 
Stern Tells of Benefits
 In two hours of testimony, Stern portrayed the economic benefits of revenue-sharing and the salary cap, saying player salaries and benefits have risen from $79.6 million in the 1982-83 season to a projected $535 million in the season just ended. During the same period, Stern testified, league revenues subject to the cap rose from $135.2 million to a projected $945 million. The league assigns 53 percent of its designated gross revenues to player salaries.
He added that in previous agreements between the league and players, the provisions of past agreements stayed in place until a new pact was negotiated.
"Antitrust law has no place in a labor dispute," he said.
Toward the end of Stern's testimony, Duffy still seemed irked that the N.B.A., in essence, went to court to keep the dispute out of court.
"You expect everyone to roll over, say, 'Goody,' and do what you want?" Duffy asked Stern.
"We don't believe that," Stern said.

HEADLINE: Missed Chances in Europe

 BODY:
It is no secret that President Clinton is trying to demonstrate to the American public that he is capable of consistent, credible foreign policy leadership. On that score, the summit meeting of industrial democracies in Naples -- the centerpiece of his latest European tour -- was a missed opportunity.
It is also no secret that it is not as easy nowadays for an American President to dominate the world stage. Absent a common Soviet threat, America is seen as one more player in a complex and increasingly parochial post-cold war world. In the past, for example, Mr. Clinton's plea to the industrialized nations to open their markets to Eastern Europe might have commanded a respectful hearing; troubled by unemployment, the industrialized nations turned a deaf ear. 
 Unfortunately, Mr. Clinton and his team created problems of their own. The trip was marked by an informal clumsiness and lacked any theme or thread. He began inauspiciously with an odd, disengaged speech in Washington that seemed deliberately to ignore any foreign policy issues not directly related to trade and jobs -- even though subjects like Rwanda, Haiti, Bosnia and North Korea were sure to come up at the Naples meeting.
Later, in Naples, Mr. Clinton asserted that he saw no need to "overreact" to the dollar's decline; when the dollar immediately tumbled further, his staff, always on damage-control alert, hurried to explain that he had not ruled out measures to support it. At another point, he made a modest last-minute proposal for further trade liberalization. His surprised European colleagues rebuffed him. Mr. Clinton would have done better to consult them in advance, especially since an earlier, broader agreement has not yet been ratified.
But these bumbles and stumbles were not nearly as significant as his larger failure to see Naples as a chance to define -- for Americans as well as Europeans -- how today's tussles over exchange rates and trade agreements relate to the larger goals of reducing unemployment in the West and consolidating democracy and markets in the former Soviet empire. Moreover, Mr. Clinton might have used some of his time to coordinate with his allies on specific crises like Haiti and Rwanda, where there are sharp disagreements.
The issues Mr. Clinton tried to ignore forced their way onto the agenda anyway. On his first day in Europe, his own Pentagon upstaged him with leaks about commandos rehearsing to invade Haiti. Then Panama reneged on a plan to shelter refugees, forcing his traveling staff to scramble for explanations. The Naples gathering itself began under the shadow of the unexpected death of Kim Il Sung. And it closed with Boris Yeltsin sidestepping Mr. Clinton's calls to withdraw Russian troops from the Baltics by the end of next month.
So much for the illusion of an economics-oriented, photo-opportunity summit conference.
Elsewhere, the President got other issues just right, ably resisting the temptation to tell his hosts what they wanted to hear. In Riga, Latvia, he supported the sovereignty of the Baltic countries, while chiding their provocative treatment of Russians stranded inside their borders. In Warsaw, he made the most of NATO's newly formed Partnership for Peace, but rightly deferred the question of full NATO membership for Eastern Europe.
Overall, it was a journey of bits and pieces, none of which collected themselves into a satisfying whole. As such, it was another illustration of the discontinuity between policy and presentation that has plagued this Administration from the start.

HEADLINE: Help the Poor Help Themselves

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As the founder and president of TechnoServe, a nonprofit, international development organization that has worked with the poor in the developing world for more than 25 years, I have learned some valuable lessons.
The lessons of a quarter-century of experience in Latin America and Africa helping the working poor establish and expand their own small businesses are the operating principles in what we call participatory development: helping people to help themselves. Here are the most important, which translate into any language and will work in America's cities as well as in the developing world. 
 First, never lead with money. The service or agency designed to help the poor through participatory development should not be in the business of giving away money, but sharing know-how and knowledge. The woman who styles hair out of her home, for example, needs not simply capital but business advice: a business plan, an advertising-marketing strategy and training in bookkeeping and accounting. She will then have the ability to manage her own business, as well as make it grow and prosper.
In addition, the relationship between the assisting agency and the beneficiary then becomes a partnership, rather than a handout. Both partners have a sense of pride in the relationship and the outcome.
Second, participants must show their commitment by having a stake in the project. As owners of the enterprise they must invest some of their own capital. This simple idea follows the principle that if people don't have a vested interest in something, they are less likely to see it through the often long and difficult road to success. TechnoServe will often wait months, even years, for the poor farmers of Africa and Latin America with whom we work to save the $10 or $20 required to start a new project.
Third, a new enterprise will have best results if owned by groups of people. People involved in a project share ideas, make up for individual weaknesses and support one another. By assisting a group of significant size, the development agency can also have the highest impact on the larger community. Such a venture will be more cost-effective, expand more readily, create more jobs and ultimately improve the lives of many more people in the neighborhood.
Empowering poor people overseas does not preclude helping the needy here at home. Both are necessary and possible. The key to success is fostering not dependency but a sense of participation and partnership between the agency and the poor. Once people have learned to run their own enterprise, they can go on by them
selves without further assistance. Those are the kind of success stories we'd like to see in Baltimore, as well as in Bolivia.

HEADLINE: White House Says Growth Is Pushing the Deficit Down

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials today reduced their forecast for this year's Federal budget deficit by $14.7 billion because stronger-than-expected economic growth has produced more than enough tax revenue to offset the cost to the Federal Government from higher interest rates.
But they cautioned that unless long-term interest rates fell to their levels of earlier this year, higher interest on the national debt would result in slightly higher deficits later in the decade. 
 Today's announcement of the revision was the latest in a series of estimates by Government and private economists that the Federal Government's finances are improving. The improvement is important because it means that the Federal Government can borrow less money, making it easier for businesses to borrow money instead to invest in new factories or offices.
Less deficit spending also means that the Federal Government is doing less to stimulate short-term economic growth. This in turn reduces the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The Federal Reserve has been worried that the economy is already growing so fast that it may overheat, fueling inflation, and it has responded by raising short-term interest rates four times this year.
 
White House Is Cautious
 Congressional Budget Office experts have been estimating for several weeks that the deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will fall as low as $200 billion.
But Leon E. Panetta, who remains the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget until Thursday, even though he has already taken his next job as White House chief of staff, was more cautious in announcing the Administration's new estimates at a White House press conference today. He predicted that the deficit for the current fiscal year would be $220.1 billion, compared with his February estimate of $234.8 billion.
Mr. Panetta suggested that the Administration should receive considerable credit for the shrinking deficit. But Republicans on Capitol Hill said underlying budget problems persisted and had merely been obscured by the extra tax revenue from economic growth.
"We have not solved any problems. We have temporary relief because of the business cycle," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, who is the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee.
 
Deficit Could Rise
 Mr. Panetta also forecast today a deficit for the next fiscal year of $167.1 billion, down from his previous estimate of $176.1 billion. However, Office of Management and Budget documents distributed at the press conference, but not discussed in detail by Mr. Panetta, predicted that the deficit would rise to $207.4 billion by 1999, more than the office's previous estimate of $201.2 billion.
All these estimates excluded the budgetary effects of whatever health care legislation may emerge from Congress this year.
Alice M. Rivlin, the budget office's deputy director and Mr. Panetta's designated successor as director, said that in addition to extra tax revenue from higher than expected economic growth, the Administration had also benefited from lower than expected spending on Medicaid programs. The reasons for the lower spending are unclear, because the states, which run Medicaid programs using Federal money, have not reported why the cost of these programs is not rising quite as quickly as expected this year, she added.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: THE NOMINEE;
Breyer Has Opportunity To Recount His Story Account Is Enthusiastic and Thorough

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Judge Stephen G. Breyer today began the process of defining himself for the Senate Judiciary Committee and the public, neither of which is likely ever again to hear him discuss his life and thoughts at such length.
There is no doubt that Judge Breyer will be confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice, as senators of both parties emphasized in welcoming him to a confirmation hearing that was sometimes lighthearted, sometimes ponderous and occasionally revealing of the nominee's tastes and values. 
 "I know this isn't a classroom," Judge Breyer, a part-time Harvard law professor, said at one point. "I don't like to be professorial, frankly." But he was often very much the professor, plunging enthusiastically into discussions of doctrine and cases at the slightest hint of interest from a senator.
His description of one Supreme Court property-rights decision was so vivid and his pleasure in recounting it so evident that had the opinion not been written 72 years ago by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, it might well have been a case Judge Breyer himself had worked on during his days as a Supreme Court law clerk.
He was still the cautious nominee, however, keeping most answers at a level of generality that guarded against expressing a view on issues that might come before the Court.
Typically, he would give a general description of an area of law, followed by a description of the issues in that area on which there is general agreement, followed by a description of what he called the "gray areas" on which the Supreme Court might be asked to rule and about which he could say no more. Questions with broad potential implications got narrowly focused answers.
 
Raises Role of Congress
 Asked whether statistics could appropriately be used to attack the death penalty as racially discriminatory -- a subject of heated dispute in the crime bill now before Congress -- Judge Breyer said: "There are statistics and there are statistics. I don't think there's an absolute rule that bars the use of statistics where they are reliable and prove a legal point." He emphasized that the matter was a policy judgment for Congress to make and for the courts to enforce.
Judge Breyer was also well-schooled in the deferential tone expected of nominees who come before Senate committees -- even this nominee who once served as chief counsel of this very committee and who within minutes of taking his seat this morning heard himself praised for his academic accomplishments, his foreign language skills and his interest in cooking and bird-watching.
"If I am lucky and if you find me qualified," he began one answer, and none of the laudatory senators appeared to find that note of humility misplaced.
The realities of the modern confirmation hearing also required Judge Breyer, who has served since 1981 on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, to emphasize the less ethereal and intellectual sides of his personality.
"My ideas about people do not come from libraries," he said, recalling that his mother had tried to pry him from his books when he was a child. "Of course she was right."
 
Praise for His Labors
 And members of the Judiciary Committee appeared thrilled to have learned, from Judge Breyer's committee questionnaire, that he spent a summer during high school digging ditches for a California utility. Praise for the lawyer's son who sampled physical labor became a kind of mantra as the hearing progressed.
Senator Strom Thurmond, the 91-year-old South Carolina Republican, had an opening statement noting that "Judge Breyer has come a long way from the summer in 1958 he spent as a ditch digger." Even for Mr. Thurmond, who usually reads his prepared material verbatim, this was a bit much. He amended his statement to note simply that Judge Breyer had once worked as a ditch digger.
In his testimony, Judge Breyer offered a down-to-earth description of his judicial philosophy. The purpose of the Constitution, he said, is "to guarantee people the rights that will enable them to lead lives of dignity." When Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the committee's ranking Republican, asked him to agree that a judge's only job was "applying the law," Judge Breyer would not accept that formula without a qualification.
"Of course that's true," he said. But it is not always so clear what the law is in the "vast, open areas" in which the Supreme Court operates, he said, adding, "There are such good arguments on both sides of such important policy issues." The purpose then, Judge Breyer said, was to "find the correct solution, the helpful solution consistent with the underlying human purpose."
"I'm in favor of moderate judges," he said at one point to Senator Thurmond in discussing membership on the United States Sentencing Commission.
Judge Breyer's humanistic description of his approach to antitrust law managed to pre-empt criticism from the one Senator, Howard M. Metzenbaum, who had expressed serious reservations in advance of the hearing. Even before Mr. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, began his questioning, Judge Breyer described antitrust law as "the policeman of the free enterprise system" with the primary mission of protecting consumers.
So Senator Metzenbaum's prepared statement, accusing Judge Breyer of seeing antitrust law only "in terms of abstract economics" in which "complicated charts and graphs replace individual justice," fell a bit flat by the time he read it. Senator Metzenbaum said he expected to vote for Judge Breyer in any event, urging the nominee to remember their colloquy once he sat on the Supreme Court. "Maybe the milk of human kindness will run through you and you won't be so technical," Senator Metzenbaum said.
 
Old Ties Important
 More important than any substantive issue was the personal relationship that Judge Breyer had established long ago with important committee members. Senator Alan K. Simpson, the sharp-tongued Wyoming Republican, said he remembered that Judge Breyer, in his role as counsel to the Judiciary Committee, was "courteous and fair to me as a freshman Senator, never judging or measuring things with a political yardstick."
Senator Simpson noted that Judge Breyer's son Michael, a Stanford University sophomore who sat behind his father in the hearing room, would he hiking through Wyoming later in the summer.
The Senator said he hoped Michael would enjoy himself, adding that while the son was hiking, "I'll be astride a horse."
"You'll be walking, I'll be riding," Senator Simpson said, leaving father and son looking a bit mystified.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Show An Upturn

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Treasury bonds rose for the first time in a week yesterday as a Government report surprised investors with the news that inflation was nonexistent in June.
 The benchmark 30-year bond rose 13/32 , or $4.06 for each $1,000 bond, to yield 7.68 percent, four basis points lower than Monday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Bonds gained as much as 3/4 point after the inflation report. 
While there is now less pressure for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to contain inflation, many traders are concerned the falling dollar will discourage foreign investors from buying dollar-denominated assets such as bonds, limiting the market's advance.
 Earlier yesterday, the Labor Department said prices paid to producers in June were unchanged for the third month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had predicted an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent for the month.
 Federal Reserve officials are "breathing a sigh of relief," said Alan McClymonds, a trader at CS First Boston, who added that he did not think the central bank's officials wanted to raise rates. "They're looking for a reason not to," he said.
 
Producer Prices Report
 The producer prices report is the first of four important reports on the economy scheduled for release this week. The June Consumer Price Index is due today, and tomorrow the Government is scheduled to release its report on June retail sales.
 The bond market's initial rally was reversed as the dollar tumbled to a post-World War II low against the Japanese yen. As the dollar recovered, the bond market advanced.
 The two-year note yield was 6.21 percent, down from 6.25 percent. The bond's yield was 6.3 percent when the Federal Reserve began raising rates Feb. 4. The record low yield is 5.77 percent, set on Oct. 15.
 As benign as the inflation report was, it was not enough to convince some bond investors, said Mr. McClymonds at CS First Boston. "We still go back to the reality of a weak dollar and the potential inflation pressures in the future," he said.
 The crumbling dollar makes it riskier to bet on which direction bonds will take, even in the face of economic reports that signal inflation is under control, said Steven Van Order, who helps manage $3.5 billion in fixed-income securities at Calvert Asset Management in Bethesda, Md.
 "If the dollar stays weak and people keep hiding from the 30-year bond, we could hit 8 percent by August," Mr. Van Order said. "It's the kind of summer that makes it difficult to take a vacation. It even makes it difficult to go down the hall to see someone." Even though the economy grew 3.4 percent in the first quarter and 7 percent in the last quarter of 1993, the Government's inflation statistics show little sign of rising prices, analysts said.
 Inflation "doesn't necessarily have to show up, because there's a lot of competitiveness out there" between businesses, said Kevin Flanagan, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Consumers are balking at higher prices."
 In another price report yesterday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said its index of business activity rose to 18.1 in June, from 16.1 in May. Raw material prices paid fell to 29.4, from 33.6 in May, and the Atlanta Fed's index of prices received dropped to 4.5 last month, from 14.4 in May.

HEADLINE: Technology Issues Help Lift Stock Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Stock prices moved higher yesterday, fueled by a rally in high-technology issues, signs of a steadier dollar in Europe and a firmer bond market.
The rally in technology stocks was based largely on anticipation among investors of good quarterly earnings and by solid performances of stocks like the Chipcom Corporation and Seagate Technology, which both reported strong quarterly profits. Shares of Chipcom jumped up 7 1/8, to 46 1/2, while Seagate rose 1 1/4, to 24 5/8. Cisco Systems rose 1 1/4, to 24, and Intel was up 1 5/8, to 61 3/4. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.62 points, to 3,704.28, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 9.76 points, to 719.35.
John H. Shaughnessy, senior vice president and director of research for Advest Inc., attributed the buying to expectations of and, in some cases, already good second-quarter earnings by small-capitalization stocks that had been beaten down lately.
"These small-cap stocks in many cases have been oversold and are ripe for recovery as they respond to strong earnings," Mr. Shaughnessy said.
"Markets could be setting up for a summer rally," he added. "And among the reasons to be positive are the dollar is oversold, no interest-rate hike is imminent and earnings are good."
Volume on the Big Board was brisk, with 266.3 million shares traded, up from 252.3 million shares traded on Tuesday. The number of stocks posting gains for the day outpaced losing issues by 1,155 to 912.
Stock prices were strong early yesterday, speeding past a slowly recovering bond market, while responding to favorable inflation data and stronger European stock markets that were reacting to an improving dollar, amid rumors of a coming increase in United States interest rates.
The second leg of this week's inflation data, yesterday's Consumer Price Index, showed that the trend during the last several months of limited price increases remained intact. The June C.P.I. came close to expectations, with an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent, both overall and excluding food and energy.
Dave Cohen, an economist for MMS International in San Francisco, said, "Increases in the core have fluctuated in the narrow 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent range in recent months, thereby showing little evidence of acceleration in the underlying trend in final goods prices, despite the run-up in various commodity prices that have peridocally unnerved the credit markets."
Anthony Ludovici, a senior vice president and senior investment analyst at Tucker Anthony Inc., said he was impressed with the breadth of the market all day as measured by the advancers and decliners.
"The basic cyclical stocks were the vanguard of the advance, led by motors and autos parts," Mr. Ludovici said. "And today, too, we saw rails also lead the Dow transport index, with Kansas City Southern in the forefront."
According to some traders, the Illinois Central Corporation is thought to be ready to buy Kansas City Southern's rail operations.
Some analysts say railroads are thriving, and their success stems from an economy that continued to expand in the second quarter. Investors are expecting to see profits after years of cost cutting.
Santa Fe Pacific, which is spinning off its gold subsidiary as of Sept. 30 and plans to merge with Burlington Northern, was up 3/8, to 19 5/8, in Big Board trading.
CBS, which will not pursue a merger with QVC after a competing bid was made for QVC by Comcast, rose 8, to 308. QVC rose 6, to 42, in heavy Nasdaq trading, on news of Comcast's $2.2 billion takeover bid. Comcast fell 1 1/2, to 15 1/8, in Nasdaq trading.
Astoria Financial rose 1 5/8, to 33, on news that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Fidelity New York F.S.B. for $160 million, or $29 for each Fidelity share. Fidelity rose 227/32 , to 2627/32 .
Regency Health Services fell 5 3/8, to 8 3/4, the largest net loser on the New York Stock Exchange. The nursing-home operator said its earnings were hurt by recent acquisitions and would fall below analysts' expectations for the rest of 1994. The company also said it would take $10 million in charges for the quarter.

HEADLINE: With Persuasion and Muscle, Black Caucus Reshapes Haiti Policy

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
In March, the 39 members of the Congressional Black Caucus in the House introduced a bill to tighten the economic embargo against Haiti, sever its commercial air links to the United States, halt the summary repatriation of Haitian refugees picked up at sea and block financial assets held in America by Haitian nationals.
The measure has not yet come up for a vote in Congress. But now it hardly matters. Virtually all its provisions have been adopted as President Clinton's policy toward Haiti. 
 "It was a blueprint for what was done in the coming months," said a Congressional staffer who closely follows Haiti. "This is what they rallied around and pushed for. And they got almost everything."
 
Growth of Black Caucus
 The Administration's adoption of the group's ideas is indicative of the political influence of the black caucus, whose numbers in Congress rose to 40 from 26 after the 1992 election. But in pushing the Administration to take more robust action on behalf of the ousted Haitian President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the caucus, in the eyes of some in Congress and the State Department, is leading the United States inexorably toward military intervention -- an issue that has divided the caucus itself.
From the dismissal in May of Lawrence A. Pezzullo as the Administration's special adviser on Haiti and his replacement by William H. Gray 3d, a former member of the caucus, to the warmer embrace of Father Aristide and the new-found reluctance of his detractors in the Administration to make their private doubts public, the caucus has played a key role in steering Haiti policy in the Administration.
Members of the caucus tend to describe its contribution to the Administration's Haiti policy in modest terms and to stress that others have also played a role.
 
A Role in Policy Change
 "We've made legislative suggestions in a number of areas and have had limited success in a number of areas," said Representative Donald M. Payne, a New Jersey Democrat and the highest-ranking black lawmaker on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "I think we certainly have played a role in the changing of the policy."
But others say the influence of the caucus is more profound.
"The basic components of the black caucus approach -- the military is the problem, Aristide is the solution; we shouldn't move away from him even two inches; we should do nothing that smacks of any kind of alternative to Aristide, like work with a prime minister -- all that has been adopted," said a State Department official who requested anonymity.
One lawmaker who follows Haiti grumbled that Administration officials consult more with key members of the black caucus about the crisis than they do with the chairmen and ranking members of House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over foreign policy or Caribbean affairs.
But the solicitation of the views of the caucus and the appointment of Mr. Gray have failed to silence criticism of the Administration's policy by some caucus members. Last week, Representative Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland, the caucus chairman, termed the Administration's efforts "a policy of anarchy, one that changes by the moment."
Representative Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, suggested that the black caucus, having gotten much of what it wanted, is simply keeping the heat on. "It has been a spiral of influence," he said. "The President has listened and the voices have been raised. The President has responded and the voices have been raised further."
 
Hunger Strike by Robinson
 To be sure, the group cannot take credit alone for having altered Administration policy. It was a 27-day hunger strike by Randall Robinson, the director of the TransAfrica lobbying organization, that galvanized the public and the black caucus to place more pressure on Mr. Clinton to change his Haiti policy. Florida lawmakers and groups advocating the rights of refugees also played a role.
Still, the caucus's interest in the issue kept it alive when many of the caucus members' colleagues in Congress and some in the Administration might have let it die. Its accusations of racism in the treatment of Haitian refugees got the attention of a Democratic President.
The caucus's 40 votes -- 39 in the House and one in the Senate -- are an unspoken part of the calculation. While there has been no explicit quid pro quo, some in Congress and the Administration are counting on the caucus to provide critical support for domestic initiatives like health care, welfare reform and the crime bill.
But while the caucus has helped push Mr. Clinton into a more confrontational stance against the military rulers who overthrew Father Aristide, the black lawmakers have yet to agree among themselves on the most critical question when it comes to Haiti: whether military force should be used to restore democracy.
Some, like Representatives Major Owens of New York and Maxine Waters of California, have advocated armed intervention to restore Father Aristide. Others, like Representative Ron Dellums of California, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, have voiced strong reservations on the use of military force.
Indeed, the bill drafted by the caucus in March deliberately avoided taking a position on an armed invasion of Haiti because the caucus could not reach a consensus, Mr. Dellums acknowledged during a debate on the House floor in May.
"We have not been, generally speaking, a group that supported gun-barrel diplomacy," said Mr. Payne. "But we are seeing a changing world. I don't think any of the members of the caucus initially supported military intervention and there are still some who oppose it. But I do think the majority of the members are slowly moving toward the point where it might be the only solution at the present time."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE HOSPITALS;
Drive Is Opened to Fight Cuts in Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Hospital lobbyists today began what they described as an all-out fight to prevent Congress from making the kind of large cuts in the growth of Medicare that several committees have proposed as a way to finance health coverage for people who are uninsured.
Hospitals have generally supported President Clinton's effort to guarantee health insurance for all Americans, and they have endorsed many of his specific proposals to redesign the health care system. 
 But leaders of the American Hospital Association, the main lobby for the industry, said today that several Congressional panels, particularly the House Ways and Means Committee, had gone too far in tapping Medicare as a source of money to pay for new benefits and new coverage.
 
Mobilizing Hospital Workers
 Medicare finances health care for 36 million elderly and disabled people. The cost to the Government is $160 billion this year.
The lobbyists said they would mobilize hospital employees and trustees across the country, urging members of Congress to spare Medicare and find other sources of revenue. In many Congressional districts, hospitals are among the largest employers.
Richard J. Davidson, president of the American Hospital Association, said: "In its quest for universal coverage, Congress looks to Medicare as a huge source of money, a bottomless well. The Medicare cuts in the Ways and Committee bill are a farce. If Congress is serious enough to make a commitment to assure universal coverage, it should be serious enough to make the tough choices to pay for it.
 
Warning on Care
 "Members of Congress ought to quit kidding themselves. You cannot finance health care reform on the backs of hospitals and doctors who serve the elderly, or else you will harm the quality of care."
Representative Pete Stark, the chief architect of the Ways and Means Committee bill, rejected these complaints. "Hospitals," he said, "have always looked at Medicare as a bottomless pit to pay them.
"I'm dumbfounded by the hospitals' terribly narrow and parochial attitude," said Mr. Stark, a California Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. "One would think they might have some interest in the health of the community at large and not just in their own self-interest. This bill is a good deal for hospitals that are well-managed. It's not too good a deal for hospitals that want to make a huge profit off sick people."
The Ways and Means Committee would slice $110 billion, or 10 percent, from projected Medicare spending over five years. Nearly two-thirds of the savings would come from Medicare payments to hospitals. President Clinton proposed Medicare savings of $103 billion, including $70 billion from hospitals. The Senate Finance Committee bill would cut about half that amount.
The House bill would set annual limits on Medicare spending, and it would gradually slow the growth of the program, so that after four or five years Medicare would not be allowed to grow any faster than the economy as a whole.
 
Shifts in Kinds of Care
 Despite strenuous efforts by Congress to rein in medical costs, limiting doctors' fees and payments to hospitals for specific procedures, Medicare now grows more than twice as fast as the economy. Part of the reason is that medical prices have been rising rapidly, and the type of care provided to elderly patients is more complex than it was just a few years ago.
The Ways and Means Committee bill sets Medicare spending limits for 10 separate categories of services. Thomas P. Nickels, a lobbyist for the hospital association, said these limits would perpetuate recent trends.
Services that have been growing fast in recent years, like home health care and nursing home care, would get a bigger and bigger share of Medicare spending, he said, while services like hospital care, which has been growing slowly, would get a dwindling share of the total.
Hospital lobbyists are telling members of Congress that under the Ways and Means Committee bill, Medicare would pay only 67 cents for every dollar of costs incurred in caring for patients admitted to hospitals, down sharply from 95 cents at present.
"Losses of this size cannot be made up through increased efficiency," said Mr. Davidson of the hospital association.
Clinton Administration officials and many Democrats in Congress say hospitals should be able to absorb cutbacks in Medicare because people who are now uninsured will have coverage in the future and can therefore pay their hospital bills.
Carmela S. Dyer, a vice president of the American Hospital Association, acknowledged that universal coverage would generate new revenue for hospitals. But, she said, the care provided free to people who are uninsured is much less significant than the proposed cutbacks in the Medicare program, which accounts for 40 percent of hospital revenue.
Moreover, she said, in the future, it will be difficult for hospitals to offset Medicare's underpayments by increasing charges to private patients, as they have done in the past.
 
Market Forces at Work
 "Market forces are already reducing our ability to shift costs," she said, and the Ways and Means Committee bill would virtually eliminate such cost-shifting because it would impose stringent new constraints on private health spending.
In the debate over health costs, hospitals have generally avoided the wrath of White House officials and members of Congress, who were more likely to criticize insurance companies and drug manufacturers. But if hospital lobbyists continue to mobilize their forces at the local level, they will immensely complicate the work of President Clinton and his allies in Congress, who want to squeeze large sums of money from Medicare.

HEADLINE: Berlin Journal;
Clinton at the Brandenburg Gate: Mixed Reviews

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 13

 BODY:
Born 24 years ago in what was then Communist East Berlin, Oliver Blasing was standing on a street crossing just east of the Brandenburg Gate on Tuesday, cheering President Clinton. Mr. Blasing had taken a day off from his studies at western Berlin's Technical University, and braved a beating summer sun to listen to a speech by Mr. Clinton on his first visit to Berlin.
And yet somehow, Mr. Blasing said afterward, it was all so familiar. He said that seven years earlier, in June 1987, he had stood on the very same spot waiting for another American President to speak. 
 Mr. Blasing, then a young East German Army recruit, had defied the orders of the Communist leadership and, together with about 300 other East Germans, gathered on the eastern side of the gate to hear President Reagan, the nemesis of the Communist world, while he addressed Berliners from a podium that had been set up on the western side of the gate, facing east.
Mr. Blasing recalled how frustrated Communist police officials set up huge loudspeakers, blaring march tunes, to drown out the voice of Mr. Reagan as he appealed to the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev: "Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"
Mr. Blasing glanced toward Mr. Clinton's platform, and the opened gate behind it, that was once barred by the Berlin wall.
"Never in my life," he said, "did I think it would happen."
Now, he said, he had returned "to see another American President live."
"I like him," he said of Mr. Clinton. "Let's hope he can just continue what his predecessors started."
Many Berliners who sized up Mr. Clinton as he spent a hectic 24 hours in their city on Tuesday came away liking him -- the natural manners, the youthful freshness.
"Somehow he's friendlier than Reagan," said Klaus Diekmann, a 43-year-old tax official who turned out for the Brandenburg Gate event. "More youthful, less threatening."
Eastern Berliners especially, accustomed for decades to the gerontocracy of Communist rule, appeared particularly struck, at times even unsettled, by Mr. Clinton's boyishness. At the same time, many Berliners expressed a sense that the world Mr. Clinton governed in had grown more complicated, lacking the old simple delineations like the Berlin wall.
"He's very sympathetic, very natural," said Annamarie Mothsche, a schoolteacher in her 40's from eastern Berlin. "You know, we are used to a very different idea of politicians. Very stiff, and dignified."
"But somehow," she continued, "you think to yourself, can he ever achieve what he wants?"
Uwe Zimmermann, a 39-year-old insurance salesman, said approvingly that Mr. Clinton "sort of reminds you of Kennedy," and that he admired the President's exhortation to German youth for civil courage, against racism and religious hatred. But Mr. Zimmermann added critically that Mr. Clinton had been "very vague."
"I think a lot of people thought he'd be more specific," Mr. Zimmermann went on.
Peter Schneider, a well-known Berlin writer, said: "For Berliners, it's always fun to have an American President here. And surely they enjoyed it."
"But of course the historic role is different," said Mr. Schneider, the author of a best-selling book about the wall. "The wall is torn down, unification is taking place."
Throughout Berlin, remarkable symbols of reunification abound, and nowhere are they more evident than around the Brandenburg Gate. The subway stop on Pariser Platz, in front of the gate, is open again, and several stops up the line is Potsdamer Platz, where bulldozers are shaping what will soon be, arguably, Europe's biggest construction site, to revive what used to be the bustling crossroads of the city in its old imperial days, but was long cut in half by the wall. But there are also the signs of malaise.
A wave of violence against foreigners has not stopped. A deep economic divide splits east and west, driving many eastern Berliners to vote again in recent elections for the old Communists. The booing and hissing that met Chancellor Helmut Kohl as he introduced Mr. Clinton testifed to the political discord.
Thus, many Berliners met with skepticism the urgings of the President for a broader role for reunited Germany on the world stage.
The political scientist Arnulf Baring of Berlin's Free University cautioned that the Germans are too caught up in the ragged struggle to unify the nation politically, economically and psychologically to heed Mr. Clinton's call.
"Clinton is urging the Germans to take the peoples of East and Central Europe under their wing," Mr. Baring said. "But this does not fit the present frame of mind."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose 0.3% in June

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Consumer prices climbed three-tenths of 1 percent in June, as increases for cars, gasoline, air fares and clothing more than offset moderation in housing, the Labor Department reported today.
The rise, which closely matched expectations, meant that inflation as gauged by the Consumer Price Index ran at the same 2.5 percent pace during the spring quarter as it had during the first three months of the year. The rate for 1993, the third straight full year of diminished inflation, was 2.7 percent. 
 However, unlike Tuesday's surprisingly favorable report that prices at the producer level were unchanged last month, the C.P.I. data provided little comfort to the majority of analysts, who say that inflation -- higher in June than in either April or May -- has begun a gradual upswing, and that the Federal Reserve will need to raise short-term interest rates again by mid-August.
 
Upward Pressure Seen
 The bond market showed little reaction to today's consumer price report, and interest rates ended the day slightly lower. [Page D9.]
Characterizing the latest figures as "neither good nor bad, near-term," Allen Sinai of Lehman Brothers Global Economics, predicted inflation would quicken during the second half of the year. "Rising oil and energy prices, a still-firm economy settled in a 'full-employment zone,' rising industrial commodity prices and a lower dollar all will impart an upward tendency on inflation," he said.
Indeed, prices of new vehicles rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month, apparently because the sinking dollar led to higher prices for imports, and that, in turn, allowed domestic competitors to push up their own prices.
Prices in the metropolitan New York area rose by the same three-tenths of 1 percent that prevailed nationally in June and were 2.3 percent higher over the latest 12 months. The Philadelphia area posted a nine-tenths of 1 percent advance, mainly reflecting summer electricity rates and out-of-town lodging for residents on vacation.
In a related report, the department calculated that average weekly earnings, fell 1 percent in June following a five-tenths of 1 percent increase in May. This resulted from a six-tenths of 1 percent decline in average weekly hours coupled with a one-tenth of 1 percent decline in average hourly earnings and the loss of buying power from inflation.
The so-called core C.P.I., which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month, lifting the 12-month rate to 2.9 percent.
"Inflation really is fairly steady around 3 percent," said Patrick C. Jackman, a Labor Department official, noting that it had been the one-time villains of food and energy that had kept the index lower lately.
 
Commodities on Upswing
 Various analysts took note today of the fact that in contrast to the usual pattern, prices of commodities have risen faster than those of services for each of the last two months. Services rose more than commodities in 22 of the latest 25 full years.
Moreover, Joel Popkin, a Washington consultant and price specialist, said the gap between core commodities and core services other than energy had become unusually narrow during the first half of 1994, as goods accelerated and services decelerated. That development is particularly noteworthy because foreign competition is less a factor in holding down the price of services.
And while some analysts might be unnerved by quickened rises for commodities, the services component is twice as large and thus a larger force for price restraint, others said.
Mr. Popkin, in fact, expressing concern that the economy was not strong enough to withstand the combined contractionary effects of both fiscal and monetary policy, predicted that the next move by the Fed would be to cut interest rates, not to raise them.
 
Housing Edges Up
 Food prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same as in May, while housing edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent with the aid of lower prices for natural gas and cable television.
The rise in apparel, six-tenths of 1 percent, was described as mainly a rebound from discounting that occurred earlier than usual this year.
Transportation provided many of the heftiest increases, with the cost of new vehicles up six-tenths of 1 percent, used cars up 1.2 percent, automobile finance charges up 3.4 percent and gasoline up five-tenths of 1 percent (2.4 percent before seasonal adjustment).
Airline fares rose 3 percent following a record 5.4 percent May drop that reflected Memorial Day promotions.
Medical costs rose four-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month and now stand 4.6 percent above the level of June 1993, the report showed.
Before rounding, the C.P.I. for All Urban Consumers rose 0.2708192 in June, an increase that if maintained and compounded over 12 months would produce an annual inflation rate of 3.3 percent.
The index now stands at 148.0, meaning that an array of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-84 reference period now costs $14.80. The value of the 1982-84 dollar is now 67.6 cents.

HEADLINE: A New Report Suggests U.N. Consolidate

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 13

 BODY:
A new, privately commissioned report issued today suggests the United Nations should create a common headquarters for the General Assembly, the Secretariat and all its specialized agencies as the United Nations' founders originally envisaged.
The report, titled "Renewing the United Nations System," was financed by the Ford Foundation and written by two former senior United Nations officials, Sir Brian Urquhart and Erskine Childers. It also recommends radical reform of the International Monetary Fund and other aid organizations to mount an attack on the world's economic inequalities, which have left 80 percent of the world's wealth in the hands of 20 percent of its population. 
 The report recalls that the United Nations founders and the first meeting of the General Assembly both recommended that the United Nations group all its agencies in a common seat instead of spreading them around the world's capitals as it has done.
It suggests returning to this idea in the interests of efficiency and cutting costs with a single site for the United Nations Secretariat, the General Assembly and such agencies as the World Health Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization, the International Labor Organization and the International Monetary Fund, which are currently in Geneva, Rome, Vienna and Washington.
 
Site Not Recommended
 While it does not say where such a headquarters should be, Geneva and Bonn, once the German Government moves to Berlin, are both mentioned as possibilities. But Sir Brian argued today that there is a strong case for grouping all United Nations agencies in New York to bolster American support for the organization.
The report, which concentrates on improving the United Nations economic and social activities and does not deal with peacekeeping or Security Council matters, says all United Nations development work, including Unicef and the United Nations Development Fund, should be consolidated into a single new United Nations Development Authority.
It also recommends abolishing the I.M.F.'s present voting system, which keeps control of the fund in the hands of the richest countries, and it calls for the creation of new low-interest lending to help the poorest countries.
Copies of the report are available for free from the Ford Foundation, 320 East 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10017. Telephone: (212) 573-5000.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong's Governor Says China Undermines Colony

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 13

 BODY:
At times battered by ferocious criticism from Beijing, and at times ignored, the Governor of Hong Kong vigorously defended his program of local democratization today and lashed out at the Chinese Government for undermining confidence in the colony in the three years before Britain surrenders sovereignty.
Mixing sarcasm with passion, anger with fervor, the Governor, Christopher Patten, placed blame for the growing nervousness among many people in Hong Kong about China's looming takeover squarely on Beijing's leaders. 
 In an interview in his spartan office in the grand Governor's residence on a hill overlooking the business district, the man who is probably Britain's last governor here said confidence in the colony could only be assured by Beijing.
"I have never sought to deny that they can come in and throw out the legislative council, the directly elected local government and bodies that have been created," Mr. Patten said. "I don't think that will be widely regarded as a very effective way of winning people's minds and hearts. And I think the rest of the world will inevitably see China's assumption of international responsibilities very much through the prism of how it deals with Hong Kong and how it behaves in Hong Kong."
 
Broader Democratic Rights
 Two weeks ago, Hong Kong's legislative council, the partly elected law-making body, approved the Governor's proposal to broaden democratic rights in the colony before China assumes control. His plan, loudly attacked by Beijing, will increase the number of directly elected seats on the council and expand electoral participation for those seats that are indirectly elected.
China has declared that it will dissolve the elected council, and Mr. Patten said such statements demonstrated Beijing's shortsightedness and ignorance of Hong Kong.
Referring to the document, signed by both Britain and China, that is to serve as a sort of constitution for Hong Kong after the assertion of Chinese rule, Mr. Patten said: "The Joint Declaration says we should have an executive who is accountable to the legislature and that the legislature should be composed through elections. It doesn't say fair elections because I don't think anyone seriously believed that we should sign up to elections which, as it were, were sculpted by Mayor Daley."
"It seems preposterous to argue you could have sham elections to the legislature which makes Hong Kong's laws and still have the fundamentals of the rule of law. And it's the rule of law which provides the unique spark in Hong Kong. We have spectacular economic success because of the combination of Shanghainese, Cantonese entrepreneurialism and the rule of law. Take away the rule of law and I think a great deal else unravels."
 
A Voice for the People
 Appointed Governor of Hong Kong in 1992 after losing his parliamentary seat, Mr. Patten, now 48, has alone among the colony's long line of governors insisted that the people be given a voice in their own future, a policy that has pitted him against the Beijing Government. In recent days, a series of articles and statements by Chinese officials have suggested that Beijing's rule here will be even more intrusive than many people have believed.
This week, a Chinese Communist Party propaganda official threatened the owner of a new newspaper here, The Eastern Express, for its critical coverage of China. The official, Huang Xinhua, declared that Hong Kong journalists should "be wise," and "act in line with the circumstances."
"Take these words to C. K. Ma," the owner of The Express, the official said. "Tell him to watch out."
Although confidence in Hong Kong is soaring among foreign investors, bankers and financial services groups, there are growing signs of anxiety among Hong Kong's citizens. This week, more than 42,000 people submitted applications for the last 13,000 British passports that are to be granted to Hong Kong residents. Even some of this colony's most prominent business executives, men who have publicly expressed support for China, have been quietly applying for British passports for themselves and their families, government officials said.
Mr. Patten said confidence in Hong Kong was not necessarily automatic.
"I think that a responsibility which China and this government have is to give people as much reassurance about the future as possible because inevitably from time to time people will be looking for it," the Governor said. "But the reassurance has above all to come from China's deeds."
For more than a year, talks between Britain and China over the terms of the colony's hand-over have been stalled, in part because of Mr. Patten's push toward democratization and in part because the Chinese Government found Hong Kong's approach to financing a new, $16.5 billion airport unacceptable. Those talks have now resumed, but with a warning by China that all of Mr. Patten's political reforms will be scrapped after it regains control of the colony.
 
A Down-to-Earth Style
 The Governor, who has wooed the people of Hong Kong with a down-to-earth style, lashed out at Beijing's threats and with Beijing's sympathizers in the colony, many of whom are leading lights in business.
"This is one of the most sophisticated economic communities in the world, well traveled, well educated, hugely successful economically," he said. "There are some people who think that it's outlandish that they want to decide how their kids should be educated, who should collect the dustbins, how much of their taxes should go on housing rather than the health service. I mean it's crazy."
"What we do have to do now," he concluded, "is to try to convince the business community that accountable government and the beginnings of democratization aren't a threat to 5 1/2 percent growth, low taxes, big surpluses and a pro-business ethic in government.
"I hope we will be able to make at least some progress in convincing Chinese leaders that this hugely precious community, representing as it does 23 percent of Chinese GNP, succeeds not just because of some capitalist equation but because its way of life helps to sustain its prosperity as well as its prosperity helping to sustain its way of life."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: THE HEARING;
Cheerful Court Nominee And Cordial Senate Panel

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Judge Stephen G. Breyer, who seems headed for easy confirmation to the Supreme Court, today painted a broad picture for the Senate Judiciary Committee of his views on the death penalty, freedom of religion and how he goes about the job of being a judge.
In his second day of testimony before the committee, Judge Breyer also elaborated on his earlier defense of his participation in pollution cases as a Federal judge. At the time, he faced great financial losses from his investment in an insurance syndicate suffering financial losses from pollution lawsuits. Judge Breyer, who on Tuesday sought to pre-empt any criticism of the issue with a statement to the committee, faced his first questioning on the subject today. 
 He told Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, that he was confident that he did not violate either the law or judicial ethics canons when he participated in eight pollution cases while he was a shareholder in a Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate.
Judge Breyer said he had an elaborate system in place to ward off potential conflicts. "I have three screening systems, now four, to make certain that I never sit on a case in which any firm in which I have an investment -- including Lloyd's, including that syndicate, including any part of Lloyd's -- is a party in that case," he said. The system he described involved having his cases screened by clerks and secretaries and finally himself, and if anything seems questionable, "bells go off in my mind."
 
More TV Urged for Court
 In a day of wide-ranging topics, Judge Breyer also said he was open to expanding the televising of Federal court proceedings to help educate the public about the law, but he declined to say whether he had watched any of the televised preliminary hearing for O. J. Simpson.
In a colloquy with Senator Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, Judge Breyer seemed to be initially unaware that he was veering close to discussing the underlying legal issues in a sex-harassment suit brought against President Clinton. In discussing immunity for Government officials, he consulted a pocket-sized edition of the Constitution and joked about whether he could recall a precise quote from Judge Learned Hand about immunity.
But in the middle of the discussion with Senator Brown over whether a President is immune from a civil lawsuit for private behavior, Judge Breyer sat up in his chair, seeming to suddenly realize that the legal concepts he was cheerfully discussing might apply to the lawsuit brought against Mr. Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones.
Judge Breyer then, just as cheerfully, declined to go into the matter further.
Despite the debate over the Lloyd's issue, Judge Breyer, who is currently the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, faces no threat to his confirmation as the nation's 108th Justice of the Supreme Court. Several members of the Judiciary Committee spoke to him today as though he were about to be sworn in. Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat, for example, urged Judge Breyer to make certain that he stayed in contact with ordinary people after he joined the Supreme Court.
 
Link to Ordinary People
 When Judge Breyer said one way he did that was through his wife, Joanna Hare Breyer, who counsels children terminally ill with cancer and their families, Senator Simon urged him to do more. He told him to reach out "to people who are unemployed, who are hurting in our society."
Throughout the day, Judge Breyer offered his views on how emotional a judge should be in writing an opinion, when a judge should dissent and why it is important to achieve consensus on a judicial panel.
When asked if he would be a voice for the least fortunate in society, as was Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the man he would replace, Judge Breyer replied that he disliked emotional court opinions.
He said he had once received wise advice from Judge John Minor Wisdom, a renowned Federal appeals court judge. "He said if you feel you want to write a purple passage because you feel so strongly, write it and don't use it because people want your result and are not necessarily interested in your feelings," Judge Breyer said.
He said that consensus on a judicial panel like the Supreme Court is important because "law is a set of opinions and rules that lawyers have to understand, lower court judges have to understand, and eventually the labor union, the business, small business, everyone else in the country has to understand how they are supposed to act or not act according to law."
 
Seeker of Consensus
 For that reason, he said, he has discouraged dissents on his court unless they involved important points of principle.
Asked flatly by Senator Specter if he believed the death penalty might be imposed without violating the Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, Judge Breyer replied: "Yes. I think that is settled law."
But he said, "That settled law is surrounded by what I think of as a cluster of less-settled matters," like what age a defendant must be for the death penalty to be imposed, the type of crime and the procedures of the case.
On the subject of freedom of religion, Judge Breyer's answers over the last two days seem to have caused mild consternation among some of the panel's conservative Republican members. He has talked about the wall of separation between church and state, a metaphor that some conservatives dislike because of its suggestion of a firm barrier.
He said the great religious wars of three centuries ago were fought over the right of people to pass on their beliefs to their children. It was therefore not surprising, he said, that controversy over the issue increased when it involved schools.
Judge Breyer is expected to complete his testimony before the committee on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Bosnian Serbs Confer With Britain and France on Peace Plan

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, July 13

 BODY:
The leader of Bosnia's Serbian nationalists said today that his faction's parliament would decide on Monday whether to accept an internationally backed proposal to end the Bosnian war, but the Serbian leader hinted that in his opinion the "take it or leave it" plan should be rejected.
The remarks by the nationalist leader, Radovan Karadzic, came after a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of Britain and France, Douglas Hurd and Alain Juppe. 
 The peace proposal was drawn up by diplomats from the so-called "contact group" countries -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- who set a deadline of Tuesday for the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led Bosnian Government to accept or reject it. It would require the Bosnian Serbs to surrender about a third of the territory they have seized since the Bosnian war began in April 1992. The Serbs now hold 70 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
More objectionable to the Serbs now, however, are elements of the plan that would legally preserve the existence of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state.
In their 90-minute meeting at the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters in Pale, Mr. Hurd reportedly told Mr. Karadzic that rejection of the plan would be a "choice for war and disaster."
"We were faced with a terrifying image of an extended and intensified war that might spread beyond the borders," Mr. Karadzic said. "We listened to all this, but we also said that this war grew out of the Serbs' fear of Muslim and Croatian domination and because of our refusal to accept an independent state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We did not accept that state and we will not accept it in the future.
"If we are in any kind of relationship with them," Mr. Karadzic said, referring to the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, "it will only be as an internationally recognized state, and with this it will be possible to make a compromise. The international community has to fear war more than us, because we are already at war."
Earlier this month, Mr. Karadzic called the proposal a "humiliation" for the Bosnian Serbs.
In a meeting with the two Foreign Ministers in Sarajevo earlier in the day, Bosnian Government officials said they would recommend that their parliament accept the plan when it meets on Monday, but only if provisions for recognizing Bosnia's sovereignty and territorial integrity remain.
"About this there can be no discussion," Bosnia's Muslim President, Alija Izetbegovic, said. "The plan is bad, but all the other options are worse. If the Serbs accept the plan, they recognize Bosnia and Herzegovina. If they don't, the war will continue under significantly better conditions for us."
The so-called contact Group countries have warned that if the Serbs reject the plan the international arms embargo against Bosnia might be lifted. But Western diplomats admit that there is no consensus over what action should be taken if any of the warring sides turn it down.
Mr. Karadzic has reportedly been under pressure from Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, to accept the peace plan. International economic sanctions have hurt the economy of the Yugoslav federation, in which Serbia is dominant.
Mr. Milosevic is clearly eager to have the sanctions lifted. But Mr. Hurd said the Serbian President also refrained from giving the peace plan a clear endorsement in a meeting this evening in Belgrade.
In the event the Bosnian Serbs reject the peace plan, Mr. Izetbegovic called on Mr. Milosevic and the federal Yugoslav Army to allow the United Nations to place troops along Serbia's border with Bosnia, across which Bosnian Serbs receive most of their supplies.
The United Nations force in Bosnia has had a mandate to police the border between Bosnia and Serbia since 1992, but Belgrade has not permitted it to deploy troops.

HEADLINE: Japan's Radical Plan: Self-Serve Gas

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 13

 BODY:
A motorist arriving at a service station here is usually greeted by a phalanx of uniformed attendants shouting welcomes. They guide the car into position, wipe the windows, empty the ashtray, and check the tire pressure. If necessary, they halt traffic to usher the car back onto the road.
This is the type of pampering for which Japan, land of the bowing elevator ladies, is known. But it comes at a price: it helps push gasoline costs to nearly $4.50 a gallon, four times as much as in the United States. But now, a radical notion is creeping into Japan. Why not let consumers pump their own gasoline?
 
Called Fire Hazards
 Self-service stations are prohibited on the ground that they are a fire hazard, a particular danger in congested Japan. But with the Government vowing to deregulate the economy drastically, the prohibition on consumers pumping their own gas has become a symbol of what critics say are thousands of needless restrictions that raise consumers' costs. 
 "It's just a very typical example -- America and many other countries can and Japan cannot," said Mitsuru Shinozaki, a spokesman for a business group pushing deregulation.
But the self-service debate is also symbolic of how difficult deregulation will be to achieve against the fierce resistance of vested interests. A package of 279 deregulatory steps recently announced by the Government recommended only that self-service be studied.
The step is often portrayed as in the interests of consumers, who would see lower prices, and of American companies, which would find it easier to penetrate the Japanese market.
But Japanese drivers have not been clamoring for the opportunity to fill their own tanks. This is partly because consumer groups here are not active -- but also because drivers don't know if they want to.
Sugao Morioka, a spokesman for the Japan Automobile Federation, the equivalent here of the American Automobile Association, said that many of the organization's 10.4 million members, 16 percent of licensed drivers in Japan, had not been calling for self-service and that many would find self-service too difficult. "To introduce the self-service system, we need to train the users, probably in drivers' schools," he said.
 
No Benefit for Americans
 Nor will American companies necessarily benefit. Indeed, companies like Mobil and Exxon, which are already well entrenched here, have been opposing a broader set of proposals to deregulate the oil market.
Rather, the push for self-service has come from Japanese big business. With the rising yen making Japanese companies less competitive, they are trying to cut costs.
The press has also taken up the cause because self-service gasoline is an example of deregulation that is easy to understand -- though perhaps not too easy. Recently, one evening news program treated its presumably bewildered viewers to a report from Los Angeles in which a reporter demonstrated step by step how to fill one's own tank.
Opponents of self-service -- mainly gas station owners and the national Fire Defense Agency -- say that letting drivers handle the hoses will lead to fires.
 
Fires and Inefficiency
 "In the West, buildings are made of stone," said Yoshio Sasano, head of the National Federation of Petroleum Commercial Associations, which represents gas stations. "But in Japan, buildings are made of more flammable materials." He said that only 10 fires started each year at gas stations in Japan, compared with 750 annually in the United States.
Efficiency would also suffer, Mr. Sasano argued. Since "gasoline stands," as they are called here, are far smaller than in the West, cars would be crashing into one another without attendants to guide them, and the time it takes to fill 'er up and pay the bill would double.
Nor, opponents say, would self-service reduce prices much. Even proponents of self-service say that the most that could be saved would be about 75 cents a gallon.
But perhaps the biggest argument of all against self-service is economic. There are 60,000 gasoline stands in Japan, many of them mom-and-pop operations that can ill afford the investment to convert to self-service.
And service stations employ 400,000 of those uniformed, bowing ashtray emptiers. While deregulation might indeed be necessary to stimulate the formation of new businesses in the long run, in the short run the impact might very well be an increase in unemployment at a time when Japan is trying to pull out of a three-year-long economic slump.
There is something to all the arguments. Even in the United States, a handful of states, including New Jersey, and municipalities, including some in the New York area, prohibit self-serve gas stations for safety reasons. And filling stations in Japan are indeed quite tiny. In many, motorists can't pull up alongside the pumps because there are none -- at least not on the ground. To save space, the hoses descend from the ceiling.
Still, advocates of self-service say that fears of a towering inferno are overblown.
 
'Why Not Tokyo?'
 "You can see many self-service stations in the center of Los Angeles, San Francisco or New York." said Mr. Shinozaki, the spokesman for Japan's most powerful business group. "The Government claims people are so stupid they might spread gasoline all over the place. Why are people going to commit suicide? The Japanese regulatory system is more or less like maternalism."
Proponents of self-service say that consumers are not actively demanding it because they don't know what they are missing. A few years ago, consumers were not asking for discount stores either, and the prevailing wisdom was that the Japanese preferred high prices and high levels of service. But now that some entrepreneurs have introduced no-frills stores with lower prices, consumers have been flocking to them.
But a bigger change may be looming for Japan's petroleum industry: the liberalization of gasoline imports.
For a long time, Japan resisted importing gasoline and other petroleum products, preferring to build its industry by importing crude oil and refining it.
In the mid-1980's, the Lions Petroleum Company, a Japanese company, tried to import inexpensive gasoline from Singapore but was stopped by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In 1986, imports of refined products were allowed, but only by companies that already had refineries in Japan. A Government advisory panel recently recommended permitting other gasoline imports starting in April 1996.
Japanese refiners could easily be undercut by cheaper imports. Since the first oil shock of the early 1970's, the Government has kept prices of home heating oil and industrial fuels low while allowing prices of gasoline, viewed as a luxury, to rise. Even today, gasoline is the only profitable refined product for Japanese oil companies, said Lalita Gupta, an analyst with UBS Securities in Tokyo.
 
Deregulating Service Stations
 There is also a move to deregulate gasoline stations. A rice dealer in the Nagoya area recently opened one selling gas at 20 percent under the national average. The renegade company, Kanare Beikoku, has attracted huge media attention because it began operations without the required license. That is because the company, which is believed to be buying excess gasoline from one or more refiners, declined to disclose its suppliers.
Critics say that the requirement that service stations identify their supplier allows the Government to bring pressure on entitites that try to cut prices too much. Government officials contend that the incident had been blown out of proportion. In the last few days the retailer did file and was granted a license.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE;
Study Raises Serious Doubts About Commonly Used Methods of Treating Back Pain

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
A study that examined the spines of people without back pain is casting serious doubt on the methods used to diagnose and treat people whose backs ache.
The study, led by Dr. Michael N. Brant-Zawadzki, a radiologist at Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach, Calif., used magnetic resonance imaging, or M.R.I., to examine the spines of 98 men and women who had no back pain. The researchers found that nearly two-thirds of the subjects had spinal abnormalities, including bulging or protruding disks, herniated disks and degenerated disks. A third had more than one abnormal disk. 
 The investigators concluded that in many cases it may be sheer coincidence -- not cause and effect -- when a person with back pain is found to have an abnormal disk. Nevertheless, experts say, the use of M.R.I., a popular and sensitive imaging method, often leads to unnecessary surgery.
The study is being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, accompanied by an editorial by Dr. Richard Deyo, a specialist in internal medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle.
"I hope this study is very influential," said Dr. Deyo, whose research focuses on the outcome of treatment for back pain. Many doctors routinely use M.R.I.'s to diagnose back pain, he said. Misuse of the results this imaging method "is a bigger problem than physicians or patients realize," he said, adding, "The opportunity to be misled is substantial."
Dr. Robert Boyd, an orthopedic surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said researchers did not understand why most people with back pain had symptoms of abnormalities.
 
Cost Put at $8 Billion
 The new study follows others that showed that no matter what methods doctors used to diagnose disk problems, there seemed to be no correlation between back abnormalities and back pain. X-rays, CT scans and, in some other studies, M.R.I. scans all showed disk abnormalities in a large percentage of people with no back pain.
"Most back pain is never explained," Dr. Boyd said. But he added that most back pain also went away by itself. "If you take 100 people with back pain and look at them again three months later, 98 of them will be better," he said. "Anything you do to treat them in those three months will be given credit for healing. Treaters begin to believe that what they are doing is the reason for the improvement. And patients believe it, too."
Back pain is second only to the common cold as a reason Americans visit their doctors, Dr. Brant-Zawadzki said. As many as 80 percent of the nation's citizens complain of aching backs at some time in their lives, and nearly a third have back pain at any given moment.
The annual cost of medical care for people with back pain is more than $8 billion, he said.
Since M.R.I. scans cost about $1,000 each, their overuse and misuse wastes health care dollars, medical researchers said.
"Too often, people try to use the M.R.I to make a diagnosis," said Dr. John Froymeyer, director of the McClure Musculoskeletal Research Center at the University of Vermont. "It misleads you often enough that you perform unnecessary surgery, and the results are not very good."
 
'Temptation' for Doctors
 Moreover, Dr. Froymeyer said, Americans have almost 10 times more spinal disk operations than people in other Western countries. Perhaps not coincidentally, there also are far more neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons in the United States, and many times more M.R.I. machines. For example, he said, there are more M.R.I. machines in Boston than in all of Canada.
Dr. Boyd attributed overuse of M.R.I.'s to "insecurity, threat of lawsuits, inexperience and the potential for economic gain."
Dr. Brant-Zawadzki said: "Certain physicians like to be able to explain to their patients why they're feeling what they're feeling. The temptation is there for doctors who are not sophisticated to be glib about disk abnormalities and patients' symptoms."
In all the years that doctors have been operating on people with back pain, there has been only one randomized controlled clinical trial comparing surgery to conservative treatment like bed rest and exercises, and that was done 20 years ago in Norway.
The study included patients with ruptured disks, Dr. Boyd said, and found that a year after the patients' problems were diagnosed, about 80 percent of those who had surgery were better, compared with half of those who did not have surgery. But four years after the study began, the patients who had had surgery were no different from those who were treated without it -- about 80 percent of both groups were better.
"Surgery doesn't put new backs in and it doesn't give better long-term results," Dr. Boyd said. "It is indicated when pain doesn't respond to conservative treatment and is clearly associated with nerve root compression. Then the results of surgery are excellent. Instead of waiting a year or two or three to get better, you can wake up from the operation and that bad leg pain is gone or much better."
But he added that only about 5 percent of people with back pain fell into this category.
 
Tests Often Unnecessary
 Dr. Froymeyer said M.R.I. scans could not even tell a surgeon where to operate. "These tests are to confirm clinical judgment, not to make a diagnosis," he said. "People need to understand that most of the time these tests do not need to be done unless there is some definite reason."
Asked if more M.R.I.'s are done than are needed, Dr. Boyd said his answer was "an unqualified yes." He said that although he would recommend M.R.I. scans for very few of the patients referred to him, "I don't see many patients who haven't already had two or three M.R.I.'s."
He added: "Some physicians won't even see a patient without getting an M.R.I. They will say, 'Get an M.R.I., send it to me, and I'll tell you if I want to see you.' "

Economic Data Cause Little Stir

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The bond market reacted indifferently yesterday to a Government report showing a modest increase in consumer prices last month, and interest rates slipped only slightly.
The Treasury's 30-year bond rose 3/32 of a point, or 94 cents per $1,000 bond, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, slipped to 7.67 percent, from 7.68 percent on Tuesday. 
 Shorter- and intermediate-term Treasury issues also showed relatively little change.
The three-tenth of 1 percent rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was in line with expectations. So far this year, inflation as measured by the C.P.I. is running at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, compared with 2.8 percent for the first six months of 1993 and 2.7 percent for all of last year.
That level of inflation is not enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the fifth time this year, some investors said.
The Fed "must be pretty happy with what they've got going here," said Warren Schmalenberger, who manages $2.3 billion in bonds at Transamerica Fund Management in Houston. "I don't think we're going to have another rate increase very soon. It will be in the fall of the year, if we have one."
A stronger dollar also helped lift bond prices, traders and investors said, because it makes short-term dollar-denominated investments more attractive to international investors.
Some of the dollar's gains came amid unconfirmed rumors in the currency market that the Fed was planning to raise short-term rates by half to a full percentage point. But several traders said the dollar was overdue for a technical bounce after its recent sharp slide and that the rumors were an excuse for the rebound.
Indeed, there were indications that many bond investors do not expect the Fed to raise soon, since yields on short-term Treasury securities fell.
Even so, some investors argued that the Fed was still planning to raise rates.
"We're steadily showing a modest upward drift in prices," said Harvey Hirschorn, director of fixed-income research at Stein, Roe & Farnham in Chicago, which has about $7 billion in government bond investments. "That will persist," he said. "The sooner it moves, the better for the market."
John Ryding, an economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said the June consumer prices report should not reassure bond investors because "it's a rear-view mirror."
"The issue for the bond is what the C.P.I. is going to do next," he said.
Rising inflation means the Federal Reserve will have no choice but to keep raising interest rates this year, Mr. Ryding said. "The process of disinflation is over, and the Fed has a lot more work to do.,"
The Consumer Price Index was the second of four reports this week on the economy's performance in June. Bonds rose on Tuesday in a week after the Government said producer prices were unchanged in June, surprising analysts who had expected a three-tenths of 1 percent increase.
Today, the Commerce Department is to report on June retail sales. In a survey, economists forecast that sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent.
And tomorrow, the Federal Reserve will issue its report on the productivity of the nation's industry in June. Economists are forecasting a a rise in factory capacity 83.7 percent, not far from the 84 to 85 percent capacity associated with increased inflation.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of 69-day cash-management bills:

HEADLINE: Trust Started by Tree Lover Gives Botanical Garden $15 Million

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH 

 BODY:
As a young woman, Mary Flagler Cary had an enduring admiration for trees. She photographed them. She delighted in planting arbors on the family's 2,000-acre Dutchess County estate in Millbrook, N.Y.
Now, more than a quarter century after her death, the philanthropy she created is giving $15 million, its largest gift ever, to the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. The money is to sustain plant research and help young scientists pursue botanical studies in this country and abroad. 
 The gift from the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust, to be announced today at a City Hall meeting with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, is the single largest gift for the sciences received by the botanical garden in its 103-year history.
It comes at a critical time, when Federal financing for research on plant biodiversity has been scaled back, said Dr. Brian M. Boom, vice president for botanical science. He also said competition for grant money was intensifying "because private philanthropy is shifting toward sexier fields such as biomedical research."
 
Rare Specimens
 "The Cary gift is particularly significant because it sustains the nuts and bolts of plant sciences, such as the expansion of our collection of 5.7 million specimens, many of them rare and some probably extinct."
He said this collection of preserved specimens was amassed mainly by the 1,000 expeditions the botanical garden sent abroad. "With this money we can begin our second thousand expeditions by our 30 Ph.D. researchers, sending them throughout the world and especially the tropics of Latin America."
Most of the money will go into an endowment that helps finance these and other operations. The garden is about to begin a fund-raising drive with a $165 million goal. Over the years, it has had major support from Enid A. Haupt, the philanthropist.
The Mary Flagler Cary Trust was established by the benefactor's will. The Flagler family's fortune was made by Henry M. Flagler, an early business associate and friend of John D. Rockefeller in a partnership that began modestly in 1867 and developed into the Standard Oil company.
Mary Flagler, who was a granddaughter of the millionaire Henry Harkness, died childless in 1968 and left the Millbrook property she loved to the trust fund to be preserved for conservation. The property, now named the Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum, was dedicated to environmental research under the aegis of the New York Botanical Garden. The Institute of Ecosystem Studies is located on the Millbrook property.
The trust, originally valued at $50 million, has assets of more than $111 million. Substantial grants by the trust are made in the music field, for example, in support of music schools, performances and recordings.
 
Work in Conservation
 The trust is known principally for its work in conservation, preservation of the Atlantic and Gulf coastlines, wetlands and land acquisition. Other grants are used for community initiatives to work on environmental problems in low-income neighborhoods in New York City.
Edward A. Ames, one of the trust's three trustees, said the gift to the botanical garden recognized the increasing importance of the botanical sciences and the danger of losing species that could be of significant medical and economic importance.
"The funds will help support basic research by young and senior scientists, particularly in tropical areas, on identifying plants there and by supplying us with information to help us better manage the tropical forest environment," he said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
CPC INTERNATIONAL (CPC,N)

 BODY:
CPC International, a food company based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said Tuesday that its second-quarter net income increased 4.7 percent, excluding a restructuring charge announced in June.
Most notable were double-digit increases in sales and operating income from CPC's European operations, which account for 30 percent of the company's earnings. These were offset by a decline of 10.7 percent in operating income in Latin America, which the company attributed to the introduction of economic reforms in Brazil. 
 Charles R. Shoemate, chairman and chief executive of CPC, said "uncertainties related to the country's change in currency suddenly resurfaced, bringing customers' purchases of many consumer foods products to a virtual halt."
Though Brazil's currency shift went into effect on July 1, after the second quarter had ended, wholesalers were said to have reduced their purchases substantially in anticipation of the change. The situation could reduce the company's earnings by 3 cents to 4 cents a share for the year, Mr. Shoemate said.
But some analysts said they were heartened by CPC's turnaround in Europe, where recession has depressed earnings for food companies in recent years. "We haven't seen any good numbers in Europe for a long time," said Nomi Ghez, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company. "That's very encouraging."

HEADLINE: Boston Federal Reserve Selects New President

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston today named as its president a specialist in bank regulation and financial markets who has little background in interest-rate policy.
The selection of Cathy E. Minehan, who is 47 years old, the Boston Fed's chief operating officer and a career central banker, as the bank's president, holds special significance for two reasons. 
 One is that the Boston Fed president will vote next year on the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy decisions, according to the rotation of Fed presidents who are members of the rate-setting committee. These rate decisions will be the biggest single influence on the American economy's health during the 1996 Presidential election, because interest rate changes typically take a year to affect the economy.
 
2d Woman to Run a Fed Bank
 The other is that Mrs. Minehan becomes only the second woman ever to lead one of the 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve. The first was Karen N. Horn, who ran the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland from 1982 to 1987 and is now the chairwoman and chief executive of Bank One of Cleveland.
The Fed has been under strong pressure from Congressional Democrats to choose a more diverse group of regional Federal Reserve bank presidents. Regional bank presidents are not subject to Senate confirmation, a subject of periodic criticism.
They are picked by the nine-member boards of each regional bank. Three of the nine members are always local bankers, and the rest are community leaders.
Mrs. Minehan declined to discuss her views on monetary policy in a telephone interview today. The Federal Reserve has imposed a ban on such comments by its officials until Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, delivers his semiannual report to Congress next week on the economy.
Associates of Mrs. Minehan said that she had not staked out clear positions on economic issues but tended to share the mild reluctance of her colleagues at the Boston Fed to raise interest rates and curb economic growth when there was no clearly visible threat of inflation.
The selection of Mrs. Minehan had no effect on bond market trading today, Robert Giordano, a Goldman, Sachs economist, said. "She's a relatively unknown personage," he said.
 
Focus on Discriminatory Lending
 The Boston Fed is best known for its research into discriminatory lending practices by banks and savings and loans. Earlier this year, Mrs. Minehan helped oversee the production of a Federal Reserve videotape primer on how to comply with Federal fair lending statutes, and said today that she planned to continue the Boston Fed's emphasis on the issue.
Mrs. Minehan started work at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York right after graduating with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1968 from the University of Rochester. She worked in New York as a bank examiner and held a succession of vice president posts there, overseeing the accounting, check-processing and securities transfer divisions.
In her spare time, Mrs. Minehan earned a master's degree in business administration from New York University in 1977, with a concentration in economics. In 1987, she was the New York Fed's representative on an interagency panel that reviewed ways to prevent a recurrence of the stock market crash that year.
In 1991, she moved to the Boston Fed as first vice president and chief operating officer, the regional bank's No. 2 position. She became the bank's acting president after Richard F. Syron left the post in early April to become chairman of the American Stock Exchange.
Silas Keehn, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago since 1981, has announced his intention to retire on Aug. 31, and the reserve bank's board has retained an executive search firm to begin looking for his successor.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Finally Gains on Yen, But Traders Remain Wary

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar advanced broadly yesterday, ending higher against the Japanese yen for the first time in more than a week.
But currency analysts cautioned that the market remained negative on the dollar, which hit yet another record low against the yen on Tuesday, and that yesterday's gains could be short-lived. 
 "I don't think the bearish sentiment toward the dollar has evaporated," said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation. "Nothing fundamental has changed."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 98.30 yen, up from 97.40 yen on Tuesday. It also rose to 1.5422 German marks from 1.5280.
The dollar started rising in Asia and Europe early yesterday and continued to advance when trading shifted to the United States. Buying accelerated on rumors that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point to a full point, traders said.
Higher rates could help the dollar by increasing the returns on short-term dollar-denominated investments and helping to stem the flow of money to Europe, where interest rates are higher.
The possibility of a large interest rate increase seems minimal, considering that inflation remains muted. Yesterday, the Government reported a rise of only three-tenths of a percent in consumer prices last month.
Still, many currency dealers who had bet against the dollar during its recent slide bought dollars for other currencies yesterday to cover their short positions and lock in any profits.
"People weren't willing to be short dollars with those rumors around," said Jack Griffin, a vice president at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York. "A number of institutions bought dollars."
Several traders and analysts said the rumors about the potential Fed move were mainly an excuse for a technical bounce in the dollar, which has repeatedly hit new post-World War II lows in recent weeks and has fallen more than 4 percent against the mark this month.
They noted that yesterday's gains came despite a lack of market-moving news or economic data.
"Nothing crucial came out to lead the market this way," said Amy Smith, senior currency strategist for IDEA, an analytic service. "It's really just profit taking."
Some traders expect the dollar to fall further unless the Fed eventually raises interest rates or the Clinton Administration adopts a clear strong-dollar policy.
The dollar's gains yesterday extended to a number of currencies, pushing the British pound down to $1.5670 from $1.5725. But the Canadian dollar edged up to 72.41 United States cents from 72.24 cents.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
LAST week the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta confirmed what few had doubted. Smoking-related diseases have "an enormous economic impact," wrote the editors of the centers' Weekly Report -- the equivalent, they estimated, of $2 a pack in medical costs alone.
But the agency was careful not to link these remarkable numbers to the case for higher cigarette taxes, and perhaps wisely so: Few economists are convinced that the link is strong enough to bear the weight of the argument. For while the total costs of smoking are undoubtedly humungous, said Joseph Newhouse, an economist at Harvard, most are borne by the smokers themselves. "You just can't justify higher taxes on cigarettes by the damage done by cigarettes to nonsmokers," he said. 
 This latest Government report is by all accounts based on careful research. Sufficient data collected from some 35,000 adults allowed statisticians to untangle the effects of smoking from the myriad other influences on health: age, race, income, insurance coverage, education, obesity, even willingness to take risks as evidenced by seat belt use. When refigured at 1993 prices, estimated medical bills for smokers came to $50 billion a year, or $2.06 a pack. The costs borne by the public -- mostly Medicaid and Medicare -- came to 89 cents a pack.
That latter number is likely to figure in a suit by the State of Florida, which is attempting to recover medical outlays for treating smokers from the cigarette makers. And it is bound to turn heads among those looking for a palatable way to pay for health care reform. For as anyone who suffered through Econ 101 knows, taxes that offset "externalities" -- costs that aren't covered in prices -- actually increase the efficiency of markets.
The catch here is that a full accounting must also include the savings from smoking. Yes, savings: the reduced cost of private pensions, Social Security and nursing home care for smokers who die before their time. And probably the most complete estimate of the "benefits" as well as the costs was made in 1989 by a group of scholars under the auspices of the RAND Corporation.
The study, led by Willard Manning and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, put the costs not borne by smokers themselves at about 15 cents a pack. Medical bills for smokers and nonsmokers alike have since risen sharply. So have estimates of the costs of passive smoking -- a classic case of a cost not borne by the buyer or seller. And even these newer estimates, said Ken Warner, an economist at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health, neglect the nuisance cost of coping with other people's smoke.
But by the same token, the avoided costs on the pensions and nursing home fees of smokers have risen, too. And Mr. Newhouse, one of the authors of the RAND study, argues that the conceivable magnitude of passive smoking is unlikely to exceed a few cents a pack. Hence it should not be surprising that Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman, economists at the Congressional Research Service, concluded that nonsmokers' costs of smoking were "too small to justify either current cigarette taxes (averaging 50 cents a pack) or the proposed tax increase."
That is not the end of the argument, however. "We are not talking about widgets," Mr. Warner said. "We're talking about an addiction formed in childhood" -- an addiction most smokers later come to regret. Thus the idea that the only justification for limiting the right to smoke is nonsmokers' costs seems strained.
Indeed, Mr. Newhouse sees a case for cigarette taxes unrelated to the harm suffered by others. A fat tax increase, he said, might deter young smokers -- a group inclined to puff first and think later. Yet it would have relatively little effect on the habits of older smokers, and would thus not distort free choice.
This latter point does not sit well with Mr. Zimmerman. Smokers, he notes, are on average poorer than nonsmokers. Hence, while the tax might not change consumption by confirmed addicts very much, it would certainly burden people who already bear more than their share of life's economic woes.
What, then, would Mr. Zimmerman do to prevent teen-agers from being hooked by Joe Camel? "If we were really serious about it," he says, "we'd stop sales of cigarettes from vending machines" where children have access. In general, he argues, "the biggest payoff at the lowest cost" would come through tough enforcement of laws against under-age smoking.
It is easy to understand why economists are not rushing to correct the impression that smokers are a burden to society. Most, after all, would like to combat addiction among teen-agers, and most would like to find a popular way to finance broader health care coverage.
In the end, though, one still has to wonder whether the ends justify the means. More pointedly, one might wonder whether the majority of Americans' enthusiasm for better health is so shallow that they would buy it only if a minority (smokers) is forced to foot the bill.

The Clinton Welfare Bill: A Long, Stormy Journey

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
With four days left before they were to present a plan to overhaul the welfare system, President Clinton's aides faced a painful question.
They were about to propose the strictest work requirements in welfare history, but were they really ready to cut off every penny to mothers who did not comply? 
 At a daylong meeting on Saturday, Feb. 26, Andrew M. Cuomo, an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, warned that the very poor led chaotic lives and that failures would be frequent. Ending, rather than decreasing, payments would leave women and children on the streets. "Then what do we do?" he asked. "Watch them wither and die?"
But others stressed the need for dramatic change in a system that is almost universally reviled. They argued that only a no-work, no-pay plan would offer the dignity of a real paycheck. And they said that only a bold break with the past would satisfy the President's famous pledge -- not to reduce but to "end welfare as we know it."
Gene Sperling, a White House economics aide, summed up the group's decision. "This," he said, "has to be one of the things that defines us."
The debate illustrates the political forces that Mr. Clinton's welfare pledge has set into motion, and the stakes for 14.3 million of the poorest Americans, most of them women and children.
In three years, the promise to "end welfare as we know it" has grown from a snippet of campaign rhetoric, crafted by a volunteer one Saturday night, into a driving force in social policy.
That journey entered a new stage this week as Congress began debate on the 431-page bill that President Clinton unveiled last month, with all sides promising sweeping change.
The story of how the Administration arrived at that bill, pieced together from scores of interviews and internal documents, shows how politics and personalities intersected with academic theories and the realities of grinding poverty. Along the way, the idea at the heart of Mr. Clinton's plan, a two-year limit on benefits, underwent a telling change.
The idea was originally part of a much broader plan that, through services and cash supplements, would have lifted virtually all single mothers from poverty. But Mr. Clinton's proposal, while ambitious, makes no such promise. He hopes that the time limits, combined with billions of dollars in new training, work, child-care and tax-credit programs, will move recipients into private jobs. But he also offered a caution. "Let us be honest," he said. "None of this will be easy to accomplish."
Throughout the process, Mr. Clinton has struggled to keep pace with the expectations produced by his own, insistently bold rhetoric. As a candidate, for example, he rejected a complete cutoff for the non-compliant, saying in a 1992 interview he did not want to "punish the kids" for the mistakes of their parents. But as President he has embraced a set of escalating penalties that culminate in the denial of all cash to mothers who refuse to work.
As far as Mr. Clinton has moved, the political climate may have moved even further. It is his odd fate to propose the toughest work plan of any President, only to have most Republican denounce the measure as timid.
Fearful, perhaps, of ceding him the issue, some Republicans now want to go further, beyond work requirements to completely abolishing aid to some mothers.
Noting the stakes for indigent families, David T. Ellwood, one of the plan's main architects, recently took stock of the forces at play. "This," he said, "is the scariest thing I've ever done in my life."
 
The Pledge
A Concrete Call For Time Limits
 The pledge took shape in October 1991, after a phone call to the pollsters. Bruce Reed, the volunteer drafting the first major policy speech of Mr. Clinton's campaign, ran the welfare section past the political advisers, who agreed that the issue would sell with voters.
The welfare system was in genuine crisis. After remaining stable for two decades, the welfare rolls had grown by 25 percent in the recent recession, and the percentage of children born to single mothers was at a record high. Studies showed that as many as three-fourths of all black children would spend a year on welfare before reaching adulthood.
At the same time, the system offered less and less to those it was meant to support. States had let cash benefits erode so severely that some welfare families, no longer able to pay rent, were finding themselves in homeless shelters.
While President George Bush had scarcely mentioned welfare, Mr. Clinton had a record to run on. He had run experimental programs in Arkansas for a decade, and played a prominent role in convincing Congress to pass a 1988 law that requires some recipients to seek training.
In his announcement speech a month earlier, Mr. Clinton had offered a vague promise to move people "off welfare and onto work rolls," but his advisers now wanted something catchier.
"They said we should have concrete calls to make sure that people paid attention," Mr. Reed said. "And I suggested that we could call for 'an end to permanent welfare."'
The next day, a colleague supplied a paper by Mr. Ellwood, then a Harvard professor with an ambitious anti-poverty plan. Mr. Ellwood had called for a dramatic expansion of services and payments to the poor, but said that once they took place, the nation might limit welfare benefits to a period ranging from 18 to 36 months.
 
The Vision of Time Limits
 But Mr. Reed seized on the vision of time limits, picking a midpoint of two years. He forwarded the speech, along with Mr. Ellwood's paper, to Mr. Clinton, who made the pledge a few weeks later.
"In a Clinton Administration, we're going to put an end to welfare as we know it," he said at Georgetown University on Oct. 23, 1991. "We'll give them all the help they need for up to two years. But after that, if they're able to work, they'll have to take a job in the private sector, or start earning their way through community service."
George Stephanopoulos, then a top campaign aide, said Mr. Clinton read the Ellwood paper carefully, and was convinced on both policy and political grounds.
The concept of a time limit fit with the candidate's talk of balancing rights and responsibilities, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, and the clarity of the two-year pledge would help convince the public he meant what he said.
"They only believe if there's a definite end to it," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Upon entering the Administration, Mr. Reed taped the words "end welfare as we know it" to his office wall at the White House Domestic Policy Council, and quoted them like scripture when he sniffed the waning resolve of bureaucratic rivals. He calls the pledge "a guiding star."
 
The Professor
Father of the Idea Denies Paternity
 But among those made uneasy was Mr. Ellwood himself. "I don't think these are issues that are best discussed under the klieg lights and sound bites of a Presidential campaign," he said in a 1992 interview. Mr. Ellwood's 1988 book, "Poor Support," had indeed endorsed time limits, but only as part of a much broader anti-poverty program. To "make work pay," he wanted to give low-income workers sizable tax credits, a higher minimum wage, subsidized child care and universal health care.
And perhaps most important, he said the nation should guarantee that single mothers receive child support, with the Government making the payments itself if it failed to collect them from absent fathers. Only then would the Government place a time limit on the benefits, offering those still unemployed a public job as a last resort.
"I'm not truly in favor of time-limited welfare unless there are other supports in place," Mr. Ellwood said in 1992. He called guaranteed child support "the single most important" policy, and said of the time limits, "You can do that last."
When someone characterized him as the father of time limits at a meeting in December 1992, he quipped, "I deny paternity."
Though Mr. Ellwood was being recruited as a top human services official, he called for a series of state experiments rather than a national program of time limits.
"We simply do not have all the answers about how to transform the welfare system," he wrote in December 1992, adding that, "For me, the greatest fear is that desperately poor people will be cut off welfare and hurt."
But the nascent Administration was already heading in the opposite direction. Mr. Reed and other members of the transition team sent Mr. Clinton a briefing book arguing that only a nationwide program would meet his campaign pledge to put recipients to work.
"We don't need a demonstration to show us that's the thing the welfare system needs most," Mr. Reed said recently.
 
Getting Under Way
Visits to the Poor Bolster Beliefs
 By the summer of 1993, Mr. Ellwood and Mr. Reed were among the leaders of the task force that would draft Mr. Clinton's bill. While Mr. Ellwood would sometimes teasingly refer to Mr. Reed as a "right-wing hack," at a news conference in July he, too, was calling for the time limits that six months earlier had brought him visible angst.
"I was wearing a different hat in December," said Mr. Ellwood, now an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services. "Now I work for the President."
His dream of guaranteed child support died a quick death. At the first welfare meeting in the spring of 1993, Mr. Ellwood gave a long account of the intellectual journey that had led him to embrace the policy. But Mr. Reed was unequivocal in response, calling the idea "welfare by another name," and reminding his rival that the President had never endorsed it.
Neither Mr. Ellwood, a lifelong academic, nor Mr. Reed, a speechwriter and campaign aide, could claim extensive contact with the poor. At the July news conference, Mr. Reed promised to "go out and talk to the real people."
Among the more memorable of the five trips was one about 30 miles outside of Memphis. "We saw a woman in a horrendous rural poverty situation," Mr. Ellwood said. "House with no windows. Broken down ceilings. No toilet. It was just absolute, total abject poverty."
For some in the 32-member group, the visits and public hearings brought doubts about ending welfare.
"Living in this shack, 15 miles from the nearest town, no public transportation -- what kind of program was really going to make her an independent, self-sufficient, tax-paying American?" asked one member of the task force.
But Mr. Ellwood said the visits sharpened his criticisms of the status quo. "It was a radicalizing experience, radicalizing because what we saw was really, really horrible," he said.
And the trips quickened Mr. Reed's faith that the group was on the right track. "No welfare recipients complained about the time limits," he said. "Quite the opposite: they all wanted to get off welfare as quickly as they could."
 
External Forces
The Debate Moves Far to the Right
 As they worked to reconcile internal differences, Mr. Clinton's aides were under assault from both friends and foes. The team had just assembled a first draft in early December when Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the House Speaker, asked Mr. Clinton to drop welfare from his 1994 agenda, warning that it would get in the way of the health care debate.
At the first Cabinet meeting this year, on Jan. 3, the President mused aloud: Could he send up a bill that created the appearance of progress even while quietly urging Congress to defer action?
But when an account was disclosed to the press, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan exploded. Mr. Clinton was cynically using the issue as "boob bait for the Bubbas," the New York Democrat said. Insisting that welfare was the true national crisis, Mr. Moynihan threatened to use his position as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee to "hold health care hostage" until the President delivered a welfare bill.
Mr. Moynihan's comments stunned his colleagues, since he himself had been critical of time limits, viewing Mr. Clinton's pledge as irresponsible campaign talk. "You let loose a lot of forces when you say 'end welfare as we know it,' which is why I never said any such thing," the Senator said later.
Mr. Moynihan quickly disavowed his health care threat and later conceded, "Sometimes I do talk too much." But the die was cast. The President vowed in his State of the Union Message in January to send Congress a bill "this spring."
As he struggled to keep the promise, however, the forces that Mr. Moynihan described were driving the debate fast and far to the right.
Professing to truly "end welfare," Jack F. Kemp, William J. Bennett and about a dozen Republican members of Congress proposed in April to deny all cash to single mothers under the age of 21. Those unable to support their children could send them to state-financed orphanages.
In May, a group of centrist Democrats displayed their impatience by announcing their own, sterner version of a two-year limit. Representative Nathan Deal, Democrat of Georgia, captured the political mood when he proclaimed welfare dead and said, "The stench from its decaying carcass has filled the nostrils of every American."
 
The Metamorphosis
Some Victories And Some Losses
 Against this backdrop, the Clinton plan continued its evolution.
Despite Mr. Ellwood's protests, for instance, the Clinton plan would allow states to deny extra money for extra children. Citing his own research, Mr. Ellwood argued that the cap would deprive needy children of extra money without deterring their parents. But in a meeting in the Oval Office on May 24, the President sided with Mr. Reed, saying that as a former Governor, he wanted to allow states to choose.
At the same time, Mr. Ellwood found himself fighting a battle he had never anticipated, fending off attempts to limit the work program itself. Such a move could potentially leave recipients with neither welfare nor jobs. Mr. Ellwood said it would violate a cherished principle: people who "play by the rules," as he would often say, should not lose the game.
But Mr. Reed worried that some recipients might cheat the system, turning down unpleasant private work to stay in subsidized jobs. While Mr. Clinton settled on a bill that would drop recipients only if they failed to make "a good faith effort" to find private jobs, debate on this fundamental point has certainly not ended. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have both put forward bills that allow time limits on the work program.
Mr. Ellwood did win important victories on some of the anti-poverty policies he advocated in "Poor Support." Mr. Clinton's plan would expand training programs, and the President continues to push for universal health insurance. The Administration says that is the key to reducing the welfare rolls, since some recipients stay in the program just to get health care for their children.
And Mr. Clinton says he has already won a dramatic welfare reform victory by expanding the tax credits that go to low-wage workers. Congress last year agreed to spend an additional $21 billion over five years on the credits, raising the income of a low-wage worker by as much as $3,300 a year. In pushing the expansion, Mr. Clinton even relied on Mr. Ellwood's catchy phrase: the credits, he said, will help recipients leave welfare because they will "make work pay."
While Mr. Ellwood lost the fight for child support guarantees, the plan contains new provisions intended to increase collections from absent fathers. Though past predictions have often proved rosy, the Administration hopes to improve such collections by as much as $11 billion a year. The Clinton plan also spends an additional $4.2 billion on child care, with $1.5 billion going to working-class families to help keep them off welfare.
Administration officials say the plan will do nothing less than restore work to the heart of social policy. Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that the combination of "tax credits, health care and child care will make it possible for everyone who works to be better off than they were on welfare."
 
A Difficult Transition
 But universal health care is far from certain, and the tax credits would only help recipients who find private jobs. The Clinton plan denies the payments to people in the subsidized jobs program, to prod them to find private work. Most of those families would be no better off financially than they had been on welfare.
Mr. Ellwood argues that "the work program has never been seen as the ultimate resting point" for poor people. But how many of the nation's five million welfare families will be able to make the transition to private jobs? That is the biggest question about Mr. Clinton's plan, and there are no reliable answers. Over the last six months, the Administration has estimated that anywhere from 500,000 to 2.3 million families could be left in the work program, of the five million now receiving aid.
When all the provisions are tallied up, the distance Mr. Ellwood has traveled is substantial. While "Poor Support" pledged to lift a part-time worker out of poverty, the Clinton work program would leave the average mother of three about $4,000 below the poverty line of $11,300.
In a recent interview, Mr. Ellwood acknowledged the metamorphosis of his ideas, but said the plan remains a strong weapon against poverty. He said the increased emphasis on time limits was an attempt to fight a status quo that was even more cruel and entrenched than he had known.
"In 'Poor Support,' things like time limits were one item among many," he said. "In the end, I've come to believe that it's necessary, that the job of changing welfare is so hard that you really need something very clear. It's for the recipients, for the political process and for the welfare workers themselves."
"Don't forget, politics sometimes is information," he continued. "People are really frustrated and angry. The welfare system is collapsing under its own weight. We've got to do something.
"I'm really proud of what we've got," he added. "I really, really am."
 
The Money
Payment Becomes Biggest Headache
 While pledging to end welfare is one thing, paying for it is quite another, and financing emerged as the Administration's biggest headache.
The public hears the end-welfare talk as a cost-saving measure. But it is much cheaper to simply mail checks than to pay for the child care, training and wage subsidies needed to put the poor to work.
"It's the same debate we've always had about welfare reform," said Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff. "You have to make some up-front investments, so you immediately have a political problem."
Assuming that new taxes were out of the question, the leaders of the task force began by looking for other social programs to cut. In January, for example, the leaders of the task force suggested making food stamps, welfare benefits and housing assistance subject to taxation. Other benefits, like unemployment insurance, are taxed, and most recipients earn too little to cross the tax threshold anyway.
But the idea, leaked by opponents of the plan, drew fire from people as diverse as Jay Leno, the "Tonight" show host, and Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, and Mr. Panetta killed it.
Mr. Ellwood and his deputy, Wendell E. Primus, followed with other suggested cuts, most of which proved equally unpopular. The ridicule they encountered was especially painful because they both pride themselves on their past advocacy for the poor.
Mr. Primus's world seemed especially upside down on March 19, when the working group took up a proposal to cut 250,000 children from the welfare rolls by tightening eligibility for families that take in extended relatives, like grandchildren.
A roomful of affluent officials, many earning six-figure salaries, then debated the difference that the average payments of $200 can make. What would the families be forced to surrender -- shoes? diapers? food?
 
Fiscal Choices
Cutting 'Welfare For the Wealthy'
 When Cabinet members considered the financing choices on March 21, they rejected the cut and urged a strategy that would raise some of the money from more affluent Americans. Mr. Stephanopoulos suggested that they could sell it as cutting "welfare for the wealthy."
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich agreed, and took the opportunity to press for a favorite cause: a cap on the tax deductions taken for mortgages on expensive homes.
But the Cabinet also began to talk of scaling back the plan, and so did Mr. Clinton when he joined the group the next day. "He did say, 'We do have a problem: the public doesn't think this should cost a lot of money,' " said one person who attended the meeting.
While the President had considered options that would spend as much as $16 billion over five years, he settled for a $9.3 billion plan, with much less child care for poor families who are working. To save money and bureaucratic chaos, the plan would phase in the work requirements slowly, applying them only to women born after 1971. That means only about one-third of the caseload is covered in the initial years.
But even the financing for a smaller package was far from complete. The life insurance industry drowned the White House in angry mailgrams when Mr. Panetta began exploring a cap on the tax-free interest that the wealthy could collect through large annuities.
Veterans swarmed over Capitol Hill when he began to contemplate minor cuts in veterans' benefits. And the Nevada delegation exploded over the possibility of a gambling tax.
In his book, Mr. Ellwood had been able to skip the question of finances, noting only that a Government that spends "over $1 trillion to protect us from Soviet missiles" could "spare a little for social policies."
 
A Political Death Threat
 Now he watched Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, issue a political death threat over a $3 billion tax that would hit that state's casinos. If Mr. Clinton went forward with that plan, Mr. Reid said, "I will become the most negative, the most irresponsible, the most obnoxious person of anyone in the Senate."
The President abandoned the tax, and two-thirds of the final financing comes from cuts in the anti-poverty budget, including $3.7 billion in programs for legal immigrants and $1.6 billion in an emergency program for people at risk of eviction.
Oddly, House Republicans now propose to spend twice as much on welfare reform as Mr. Clinton, which would allow them to put their program into effect much faster. But they would raise their $20 billion by eliminating virtually all Government aid to legal immigrants, a move Mr. Panetta likens to that of "a lynch mob."
Mr. Panetta got little enthusiasm from House leaders when he offered a preview of the package. "The cupboard is bare," said Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who stepped down recently as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. "There are few ways of funding that are palatable."
But Mr. Clinton professes optimism, insisting that his plan will establish the principle that "welfare ought to be a second chance, not a way of life." Unveiling his plan on June 14, he surrounded himself with recipients who had made the difficult transition to work, and reiterated his pledge to end welfare. "That is really what I ran for President to try to do," he said.

LEADERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S TASK FORCE ON WELFARE
 
David T. Ellwood
Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services
 The intellectual father of time limits on welfare, Mr. Ellwood proposed them in his 1988 book, Poor Support. A former Harvard professor, Mr. Ellwood coined many of the phases Mr. Clinton uses, including his calls to "make work pay," and protect people who "play by the rules."
 
Mary Jo Bane
Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services
 A former Harvard professor, Ms. Bane was Mr. Ellwood's co-author on several pioneering welfare studies in the 1980's. Before joining the Administration, she served as New York State's Commissioner of Social Services.
 
Bruce Reed
White House domestic policy aide
 A former campaign aide to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Reed is the most conservative of the three leaders, pushing for stricter work requirements. He wrote the 1991 speech in which Mr. Clinton first promised to "end welfare as we know it."
 
OTHER PIVOTAL PLAYERS
 
Leon E. Panetta
White House Budget Director
 As the attempt to raise billions of dollars flagged, Mr. Panetta took over the financing strategy. He blocked some deep cuts in anti-poverty programs, but failed in his attempt to raise money from wealthier Americans, inciting a battle from Washington lobbies.
 
Donna E. Shalala
Secretary of Health and Human Services
 Ms. Shalala once served as head of the Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy group skeptical of time limits on welfare. But she has now helped draft one of the toughest work requirements in history.
 
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee
 A pivotal but erratic player in social policy, Mr. Moynihan accused the President of abandoning his campaign pledge. His threats to block a health care plan prompted the White House to accelerate the drafting of the welfare plan.
 
President Clinton
 He prides himself on his commitment to overhauling welfare and his knowledge of the technical issues. As Governor of Arkansas, Mr. Clinton conducted experimental programs and helped Congress revise welfare laws in 1988. His famous campaign pledge to "end welfare as we know it," did much to reshape the national debate. (pg. A18)

HEADLINE: Optimism Ignites a Stock and Bond Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Stocks and bonds rallied yesterday in their best session in weeks, riding the crest of investor optimism brought on by low inflation data, a stabilizing dollar and some solid second-quarter corporate profits.
The bond market led stocks higher, beginning a surge yesterday morning after the Government reported that retail sales rose a modest six-tenths of 1 percent in June, providing more evidence that the economy was not overheating. This, combined with other reports this week that showed inflation to be under control, eased traders' concerns that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates once again.
 
Bond Prices Rise
 As bond prices rose, interest rates fell, pushing the yield down to 7.53 percent, from 7.67 percent on Wednesday. Lower interest rates make stocks a more attractive investment. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average surged 34.97 points, to 3,739.25, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 4.68 points, to 453.41.
The other market barometers, which earlier were in line with the blue-chip indicators, fell off the pace at the end. The Nasdaq composite index shed half its gains in the afternoon after Cisco Systems plunged 4 1/4, to 19 3/4, dragging down other technology issues. Company officials said the company might face difficulty matching analysts' estimates for fourth quarter ended July 31. The Nasdaq composite finished up 2.21 points, to 721.56 percent.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outpaced declining issues, 1,663 to 555. Volume was heavy at 322.3 million shares, up from 266.3 million on Wednesday.
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist at the First Albany Corporation, said it was the bond market's strong surge that gave the stock market the ability to make a strong run.
 
Optimism Is Cited
 "The drop in bond yields is tied to renewed market optimism about the currency and the belief that the worst is behind us," he said.
But, he cautioned that "the move by the bond market yesterday was much stronger than any of the fundamentals of the last three days have suggested."
Ricky Harrington, senior vice president and technical analyst with Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc., Charlotte, N.C., said he thought that over the longer term the stock market was still headed down.
"We saw economic reports this week that tended to reinforce the belief that inflation is not a problem, and the economy was moving along, " he said.
"Being oversold on a short term, it set the stage for a fairly significant rally in stocks."
Mr. Harrington said a poor earnings report could still puncture a rally in stocks, pointing to the impact of Cisco System's decline on other issues.
 
Chrysler Profit Rises
 Unexpectedly strong earnings from the Chrysler Corporation helped generate market optimism about corporate profits.
Chrysler, the No. 3 auto maker, reported yesterday that second-quarter earnings rose nearly 40 percent, to $2.35 a share. Analysts had expected the company to earn about $2.27 a share, according to a survey by Institutional Brokers Estimates System.
Elsewhere, shares of Microage Inc. plunged as much as 48 percent yesterday after the company forecast lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings, citing a margin decrease caused by pricing pressure and action taken to reduce inventory.
Cocensys Inc. rose 22/32 , to 3 24/32 , after the biotechnology company said it would introduce four psychiatric drugs on an accelerated schedule.
Digital Equipment, fell 1 1/4, to 20 1/8, after the computer maker said it would take a restructuring charge of $1.2 billion.
Kendall rose 3, to 54, after Tyco International said it would buy the company in a $1.4 billion stock swap. Tyco fell 1 3/4, to 45 5/8.

HEADLINE: White House Cuts Growth Forecasts

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
The White House said today that the economy was closer to operating at full capacity than it had previously thought, and so lowered slightly its forecasts for economic growth in 1996 and beyond.
Fearing that factories and other businesses were already close to operating at full speed and could run into production bottlenecks, fueling inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates four times this year. 
 None of the officials at a White House news conference today discussed the Federal Reserve's actions. But their mention of full capacity suggested that they do not argue with the central bank's concerns, although Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had reiterated as recently as last Friday that he saw no need for further increases.
 
 
Assumes Steady Rates
 Today's forecast assumed that the Federal Reserve would hold short-term interest rates steady until the end of this year and then raise them by half a percentage point. Like most prominent corporate economists, the Administration predicted an average interest rate on three-month Treasury bills of 4 percent this year. But the private economists are slightly more pessimistic, expecting a 4.8 percent average next year to the Administration's 4.7 percent.
The officials presenting the midyear economic review, which is part of a legally required midyear update of the Administration's budget proposals, reaffirmed their predictions for near-term growth. As in February, they predicted that the economy would grow 3 percent this year and 2.7 percent next year, and that inflation would remain moderate.
The consensus of blue-chip economists is for 3.1 percent growth this year, only a tenth of a percentage point higher than the Administration's estimate, and for 2.6 percent growth next year, only a tenth below the Administration's forecast. Private forecasters and the Administration agree in estimating growth in 1996 at 2.6 percent and in 1997 at 2.5 percent.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers, announced that faster than expected growth this year and next had forced the Administration to trim its growth forecasts for 1996, 1997 and 1998 by a tenth of a percentage point each year.
"The economy this year and at the end of last year actually grew faster than anticipated," Ms. Tyson explained, "in a sense using up more of the excess capacity in the economy than we anticipated and leaving less excess capacity to be used up in the future."
 
 
Strong Business Investment
 But Mr. Bentsen said that strong business investment now was helping to sustain economic growth at current levels. Business investment has risen at an annual rate of 18.4 percent since President Clinton took office, compared with an annual rate of 2.2 percent during the Bush Administration, he said.
During the Bush Administration, a prolonged economic slowdown reduced demand for goods and services and discouraged many businesses from expanding capacity.
Mr. Bentsen also repeated in strong terms his desire that the dollar hold its value in international currency markets, although he did not mention what the Treasury Department would do if the dollar resumed its fall of Monday and last week. "Let me state that obviously we are concerned and want a strong dollar, and that is important," Mr. Bentsen said.
John Lipsky, an ecnomist at Salomon Inc., said that it was standard Government practice to assume that short-term rates would stay unchanged in the short tun, but that he expected the central bank to tighten rates sooner. Administration officals "accept that there will be tightening, and my guess is that it will come sooner than they assume," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Price Surge Is Biggest Since May

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday in their biggest rally since May amid a rebounding dollar and expections that interest rates would remain stable.
When the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose only six-tenths of 1 percent in June, less than anticipated, it was a signal "the economy isn't raging forward," said Patrick Retzer at the $77 million Heartland U.S. Government Fund in Milwaukee. 
 Combined with reports earlier this week that inflation was benign last month, the modest increase in sales signaled that the Federal Reserve did not need to raise interest rates. "Things look pretty good," Mr. Retzer said.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 113/32 , to 85. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 7.53 percent, from 7.67 percent on Wendesday and was the lowest since June 29, when it was 7.50 percent. It was the largest daily decline in yields since May 17.
 
Increase in Bond Prices
 Bond prices gained after the dollar rose against the German mark for a third day and the Japanese yen for a second day. A stronger dollar makes dollar-denominated assets like bonds more attractive to investors.
The yield on the long bond has fallen as much as 21 basis points since Monday, the most since a four-day rally lowered the yield 21 basis points, to 7.22 percent, on June 6. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The retail sales report followed inflation reports this week that showed prices at the wholesale level were unchanged in June, while consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent, as expected. Given such reports, the Federal Reserve is less likely to raise short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year, traders said.
"The whole picture's fairly benign now," said Tim Heaton, a trader at Nikko Securities.
That view was underscored yesterday by a report from the Office of Management and Budget, which left its estimate of economic growth for 1994 unchanged at 3 percent, an indication it believes the Fed has succeeded in preventing runaway growth.
So far this year, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index is running at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, down from 2.8 percent for the first six months of 1993 and 2.7 percent for all of last year.
Some investors, however, are skeptical that the rally will last. If anything, the gain in bonds is a chance to cash in on government bonds, said Richard Schlanger at Pioneering Management in Boston, which has $700 million in fixed-income assets. "If it runs much further, I sure intend to take some profits and sell," he said. A yield on the 30-year bond of less than 7.50 percent would mean it was time to consider selling, he added.
Some analysts warned that yesterday's retail sales report did not necessarily mean that consumers slowed their spending in the month. Consumer borrowing increased for the 14th consecutive month in May, implying that June sales were higher than reported in the sales survey, said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International (America). The annual rate of borrowing ran at 15.1 percent in May, up from 14.9 percent in April.
"Very possibly, what's happening is that the retail sales report may be understating the numbers," Mr. Strauss said. "The consumer credit numbers were so off the charts that they imply a lot more retail activity than we've seen in the last few months." If sales are actually rising faster than the Government reported, more inflation could be on the way, he said.

HEADLINE: Fund-Raiser Donated Office To Giuliani During Campaign

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
An East Side storefront donated for at least a month to Rudolph W. Giuliani's mayoral campaign by a real-estate executive was listed on campaign finance reports as a contribution worth $700, but the same space was recently rented to a pizza chain for $5,000 a month.
The storefront was donated by William W. Koeppel, the same real-estate executive who arranged apartments for 15 Giuliani administration and campaign officials, most of whom got their first two weeks to three months of occupancy without rent. 
 Mr. Koeppel, a major fund-raiser for the Mayor, also contributed an additional $5,000 to the campaign. If the storefront had been valued at or near the $5,000 it has now been rented for, instead of at $700, it would have put Mr. Koeppel over the $6,500 limit on individual donors set by the city's public finance law.
The storefront, at 941 First Avenue at 52d Street, was used as a neighborhood storage site for campaign literature and materials for four to six weeks, largely by Liberal Party campaign workers for Mr. Giuliani's mayoral campaign, according to Giuliani aides and campaign workers.
Gary Lewi, a spokesman for Mr. Koeppel, said the $700 evaluation was proper at the time because Mr. Koeppel had been unable to rent the space for months, in part because there was a homeless shelter nearby. "It had been vacant since June of last year and only recently has Mr. Koeppel engaged in lease negotiations with a pizza-parlor chain," he said.
Mr. Lewi said Domino's had recently agreed to a 10-year lease at $5,000 month, with the first four months of the lease free of rent.
 
'Apples and Oranges'
 Randy M. Mastro, Mr. Giuliani's chief of staff, said the $700 value was "comparable to the rental experiences the campaign had in many campaign storage sites in the city." He added that "it's comparing apples and oranges to try to draw a parallel between a short-term storage lease for a campaign and a long-term commercial lease to a viable commercial entity."
Nicole A. Gordon, executive director of the city's Campaign Finance Board, declined to discuss the storefront space donation. But she said that in determining the worth of an in-kind contribution, "you have to judge it by what fair market value is."
Ms. Gordon said earlier this week that the board was conducting routine audits of campaign filings and would look into any pertinent issues as it did so. Under the public finance law, a campaign that violates spending limits can be charged a penalty.
The administration and spokesmen for Mr. Koeppel have both said the apartment rental terms offered to the Giuliani aides were standard for the real-estate developer. They said the apartments, in four East Side buildings, were all rented at market value, thus amounting to neither in-kind campaign contributions or gifts. Other real-estate brokers have said that while one month of free rent was a standard incentive offered by real-estate dealers several years ago when the Manhattan rental market was soft, two to three months' free rent was highly unusual.
In addition, a previous tenant of one of the apartments rented by Marva L. Hammons, the Commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, said she had been paying $500 more a month than the $2,500 Mr. Koeppel was charging Ms. Hammons. Ms. Hammons also was granted four months free in a studio apartment when her two-bedroom apartment was not vacated on time.
 
A Standard Incentive
 Mr. Lewi noted yesterday that the lease to Domino's also included a free-rent incentive of four months. Other realty executives said that in the commercial market, free-rent incentives were standard. "Owners always give free rent," said Ben Fox, executive vice president of New Spectrum, who said the usual free-rent period was at least 60 and sometimes 90 days.
Mr. Giuliani has said repeatedly this week that his aides' leases did not amount to free rent because he said the total rent paid over the term of the lease amounted to fair market value. At a City Hall news conference yesterday he refused three times to answer questions about the leases, saying he had already answered the questions over the last three days.
Mr. Giuliani said news accounts failed to report that some real-estate agents have told his aides that the arrangements were not unusual. "I have repeated the answers to this over and over again," the Mayor said. "And you insist on describing this as free rent. It is not free rent." The real-estate broker -- at the NRK Management Corporation -- cited by the administration as having told officials that 75 other tenants of Mr. Koeppel's have received similar rent arrangements has not returned repeated telephone calls from The New York Times seeking comment.
Mr. Giuliani added, "Anyone who understands economics and how it operates would understand you're paying for this by paying higher rents in the fourth and fifth and sixth month. It's the same $12,000 divided by 12 or 9."
"My repeated answers to your questions," he said, "are not going to clarify things any further. You continue to use what is in fact a misleading description."

HEADLINE: New Tactics by Unions Avoid Strikes

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Corporate America's legal right to hire people as permanent replacements for striking workers, a right reaffirmed by Congress this week, has led unions to shift tactics in recent labor disputes. Their goal, which has so far been less than successful, is to regain some of the bargaining power that a strike once conferred on unions.
In some cases, like the United Auto Workers strike against Caterpillar Inc., the unions have invoked legal provisions that hinder companies from exercising their right to replace strikers. 
 In other cases, like the recent six-week strike by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union against Leslie Fay Companies, a clothing manufacturer, the workers tried a consumer boycott and other pressure tactics.
"You have to wage the broadest struggle nowadays," said Susan Cowell, an I.L.G.W.U. vice president.
Leslie Fay had threatened early in the strike to bring in replacement workers, but did not do so. The strike came after the company sought union approval to close a Wilkes-Barre, Pa., factory employing 1,200 and move the work overseas. The settlement reached last month keeps 600 jobs in Wilkes-Barre, but only for the first year of a new three-year contract.
 
Union Tactics Altered
 Striker replacement has played a huge role in shaping the tactics of the United Auto Workers in the U.A.W.'s dispute with Caterpillar, which makes tractors, earth movers and other heavy construction equipment, mostly in Illinois. Two years ago, during a strike by 14,000 workers over the terms of a new three-year contract, Caterpillar threatened to hire replacements.
The company received hundreds of responses to its advertisement for workers. People who might have been unwilling in the past to cross a picket line had come to see a Caterpillar job, paying $15 an hour or more, as privileged employment at a time when high wages are hard to find. The U.A.W. promptly capitulated, calling off the strike, and the publicity made Caterpillar a national symbol of the striker replacement issue.
Now, in the U.A.W.'s second strike against Caterpillar, the issue is labor practices instead of a new contract, even though a contract has yet to be adopted. Under the law, if the U.A.W. were to strike again over contract terms, Caterpillar could once again hire, or threaten to hire, replacement workers.
But the company cannot hire replacements when the dispute is over labor practices. The union is striking over what is says are more than 90 unfair labor practices, which involve things like dismissing or suspending workers as a result of shop-floor disputes.
With the issue of striker replacements temporarily off the table, the Caterpillar-U.A.W. struggle has taken a different course. While the company continues to operate, it seeks to get as many strikers as possible to cross the picket lines and return to work.
Some 3,000 workers, or roughly 10 percent of the strikers, have gone back, the company says. The union says that whatever the number, its strike has greatly slowed production at several plants.
 
A Presidential Letter
 Whatever the truth, the Clinton Administration continues to link Caterpillar with the striker replacement issue.
On Tuesday, after the Senate killed a bill that would have outlawed striker replacement, President Clinton sent a pointed letter to Donald V. Fites, chairman of Caterpillar. The President told Mr. Fites that while the nature of the current dispute between the company and the union did not raise the striker replacement issue, the issue had a "poisonous effect" on labor-management relations. "I want to challenge companies like yours that have been split by this issue in the past to move forward to new chapters of cooperation and economic revitalization," the letter said.
In an interview, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich was blunter. "I cannot comment on the merit of the issues now pending, but Caterpillar has a very distrustful and angry labor force," he said. "Trust was squandered because of the use of striker replacement."
The company issued statements praising the Senate for its action and noting that Mr. Clinton was not taking sides in the labor dispute. But a U.A.W. statement hailed Mr. Clinton's letter as supporting its efforts "to get Cat back on track."
Corporate officials note that since 1938, they have had the right to replace workers on strike. They say this right has maintained a balance of power in contract negotiations.
The unions, however, argue that the balance has eroded in favor of management because companies have, in fact, made greater use of striker replacement since the early 1980's than they did in the past. Until the 80's, a decade when anti-union sentiment increased among corporations and in Washington, replacing strikers was considered unacceptable by both workers and managers.
Various independent studies support the claim that companies are hiring replacement workers more frequently, or threatening to do so. The result, the unions say, has been much greater strife and bitterness in contract disputes. Unions have also had more trouble organizing new chapters, they say, and the number of strikes that result in no contract being signed has risen. Government data supports some of those claims.
 
Affecting Current Strikes
 Certainly, the threat of hiring replacement workers is playing a role in several current strikes over new contract terms. Some 4,000 U.A.W. workers, for example, are on strike at General Dynamics plants that make tanks and other military vehicles. "The strike came at a point where delivery needs are relatively modest," said Ray Lewis, a company spokesman. He noted that nothing had been said about replacing strikers.
"But if it were absolutely necessary, I am sure we would consider replacement workers," he said. General Dynamics replaced workers during strikes in 1984 and 1990 involving other unions at other weapons plants.
The issue of striker replacement also hovers in the background of a strike that started on Monday and involves 4,000 workers at six plants of the Bridgestone-Firestone Company, which has Japanese owners. The company wants more control over working schedules, including authorization for some 12-hour shifts, and it wants the workers to pay part of the premiums for company-provided health insurance.
So far the United Rubber Workers has resisted the demands. If the resistance continues, might Bridge stone-Firestone hire replacement workers? "That would always be a possibility," said Richard Thomas, a company spokesman, "but we have not even discussed that yet, because we have not gotten to that point."

HEADLINE: Greyhound to Concentrate On Shorter Regional Routes

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 14

 BODY:
In an announcement that marks the end of an era, Greyhound Lines Inc., unable to make money as the only nationwide bus system, said today that it would abandon most of its direct long-distance service and concentrate instead on regional routes of 400 miles or less.
What that means, said William Kula, a Greyhound spokesman, is "more New York-Boston, Dallas-Houston, Los Angeles-San Francisco, as opposed to Washington D.C. to Los Angeles or Chicago to Miami." 
 Long-haul passengers will still be able to get from here to there, but they will have to work at it. Frank J. Schmieder, the Greyhound chief executive, said they would have to make more transfers, in many cases to other bus lines.
"We're not abandoning the long-haul market," he said in an interview. "But we're not going to focus on it and we're not going to market it.'
And while the company plans some feeder service from smaller cities into its hubs, many places will lose their Greyhound stops altogether. The company hopes that smaller bus companies will fill the gaps.
Though Greyhound served 15 million riders last year, discount air fares had left fewer passengers willing to endure a bus trip of more than eight hours, Mr. Schmieder said, while low gasoline prices have more travelers relying on their cars.
The company announced that it had lost more than $45 million in the second quarter, compared with $5.6 million in the quarter a year earlier -- making it almost impossible for Greyhound to earn a profit for this year, Mr. Schmieder said.
Over all, the company plans to cut 100 to 200 buses from a fleet of 1,800. Other economies will include closing or consolidating some terminals, no longer keeping about 60 others open from midnight to 5 A.M. and eliminating free checked baggage.
Greyhound, which emerged from bankruptcy in 1991, remains in a vulnerable financial condition. In a statement, Mr. Schmieder said that the quarterly loss violated the conditions of the company's bank loans, but that these terms were being renegotiated.

HEADLINE: Gubernatorial Convention to Open

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 14

 BODY:
Three candidates for governor are coming to the Democratic convention that opens here Friday night, all pledging to unify the party, which finished last in 1990's three-way race won by Lowell P. Weicker Jr. But not one is pledged to accept their convention's decision, and a primary is all but certain.
The contest is a struggle to win back voters whose loyalties were weakened by a Governor allied with neither major party; by Ross Perot's 1992 campaign for President, and by the harsh actions that the Democratic-controlled Legislature took during the state's fiscal crisis. 
 Until 1990 a Democrat had governed Connecticut for 32 of the previous 36 years. Thirty-eight percent of the state's registered voters are Democrats.
 
Voting for Change Again
 "In 1994, people are going to vote for change again, in large part because they still don't think they got the change they ordered the last time out," said State Comptroller William E. Curry Jr., the candidate most directly challenging party leadership. "If the Democratic Party has the guts and vision to choose change first, then there's a chance they'll take our leadership in November."
The expected Republican candidate, John Rowland, a former United States Representative from Waterbury, outpolled the Democrat four years ago (and spent $3 million in doing so). Mr. Weicker is not seeking re-election, though his party, A Connecticut Party, supports Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark for governor.
 
Larson Is Best Known
 The Democratic leadership favors John B. Larson, president pro tem of the State Senate. Best known of the Democratic candidates and the best financed, he has raised $1.1 million so far, half a million more than Mr. Curry. Mr. Larson sounds traditional Democrat bywords, with an upward skew toward the middle class.
"I still think we're the party of hope," Mr. Larson said. "I represent the vast majority of the people who are in the middle being squeezed, the ones who are not so poor that they're on welfare, and not so wealthy as to be worry free."
Both Mr. Curry and a third candidate, State Senator Richard J. Balducci, are counting on proving, in a September primary, that they appeal to a broader group of voters than the party leaders.
 
Balducci Struggles
 Mr. Balducci has struggled to hold enough delegates to qualify for a primary. He needs 222, 15 percent of the 1,476 delegates, on any ballot. While Mr. Larson and his supporters worked to establish that he is the clear front runner, Mr. Curry appeared to be close.
Little separates the three men on issues. Many Democrats concede that any one would be acceptable to oppose Mr. Rowland.
"This is not a case where it should be Bill and it can't be John," said Thomas Carusello, the state A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political director. His vote as a delegate will go to Mr. Curry, but as Waterbury's Democratic town chairman he is pledged to support the convention's choice in a primary.
Mr. Larson, 45 years old, has represented East Hartford in the Senate for 12 years. The owner of an insurance agency, a former teacher, he has focused on family issues, education and economic development.
A critic of Mr. Weicker's economic efforts, which include grants and loans to businesses, Mr. Larson says Connecticut needs an economic vision. He proposes making the state a leader in high-technology research.
He has supported bills to toughen criminal penalties, to expand the death penalty, to ban assault rifles and to restrict handgun purchases.
"The first initiative of the Governor, aside from establishing a jobs agenda, has to be to make the streets safe and the schools safe and to make people feel safe and secure in their homes," he said.
Mr. Curry, 42, was challenging the party establishment in the 1970's, pushing for campaign reform as a young State Senator from Farmington. In 1990 he won nomination for comptroller at the convention against an incumbent seeking a fifth term.
Mr. Curry is regarded as the race's intellectual, not always a compliment in Connecticut politics. He has released detailed plans for economic development and for fighting crime ("and its causes," he adds). He relishes radio talk shows as opportunities to administer civics lessons.
"People understand that fixing the bureaucracy and fixing the political system are related," Mr. Curry said. "They understand that the cornerstone of this political culture has become a kind of legalized bribery."
Mr. Balducci, 52, was elected to the Senate in 1992 after nine terms as a representative from Newington. He contends that economic development requires lower property taxes. He is best known for his role in 1991, as House speaker, in forming a coalition that enacted a personal income tax to ease the state's fiscal crisis.
"After years of opposing the income tax, he was convinced there was no good alternative," said Ellen Camhi, Stamford's town chairwoman. "It was a very difficult, wrenching session, and he kept people from destroying each other, the party, the state, and came up with the best possible solution."

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Tepid, Spurring the Markets

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Consumers increased their spending at retail counters by a tepid six-tenths of 1 percent in June, a smaller rebound than expected from two straight months of decline and confirmation that this engine of economic growth is running low on steam.
"The consumer has backed off from the first-quarter buying binge," said Martin A. Regalia, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, referring to the Government's report on sales last month that also included a downward revision for May. 
 Except for last Friday's labor-market report, itself not without soft spots, today's results from the Commerce Department were the latest in a long series of statistics indicating slower economic growth and inflation still in check.
Most analysts take this to mean that the Federal Reserve is finding it progressively harder to find domestic reasons for another increase in short-term interest rates to head off any future revival of inflation. The Fed is thought unlikely to move solely to support the sagging dollar.
That outlook gave heart to the bond market, which rallied for its best session in weeks. Stocks followed suit, with the Dow Jones industrial average spurting by 34.97 points, spurred not only by bonds and falling interest rates but by investor optimism on inflation. [Pages D6 and D13.]
 Separately, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for unemployment insurance jumped 19,000 last week to the highest level, 363,000, since mid-May. The figures were unusually hard to interpret, however, since they were muddied by the Fourth of July holiday. Holidays tend to depress claims despite adjustments for them.
In addition, the report reflected the first full week of a new quarter, and because benefits are based on recent quarterly earnings, many people with rising earnings defer filing so as to include a second quarter.
Jobless claims for the week ended July 2 were revised to show a 9,000 decline instead of the initially reported drop of 21,000, the figures also showed.
The retail sales report, though showing gains in seven of the nine principal categories, was robust in only a few areas, and in two of these -- department stores and stores selling apparel -- there are already signs of weakening in early July.
Today's results also seemed to shed light on the Federal Reserve's report on Tuesday of accelerating extensions of consumer installment credit. That implied that consumers were borrowing under duress rather than because they were confident about jobs and incomes, suggesting that even small spending increases -- retail sales account for one-third of economic activity -- might be hard to sustain.
"What's slowing down the economy is consumer spending -- it's already happening," said James E. Annable, chief economist the First National Bank of Chicago. He said the benefits of low interest rates and mortgage refinancing were "playing out" and that debt-to-income ratios had climbed back to their peaks of the 1980's.
Laurence H. Meyer, an economic consultant in St. Louis, told clients today that it would "be a stretch" for growth in gross domestic product to reach a rate of 3 1/2 percent for the April-June quarter.
 
Effect on the Fed
 This, however, would still be above the 2 1/2 percent or so that most economists regard as the economy's long-run capacity, one reason to think the Fed will not abandon thoughts of another tightening of monetary policy. Gross domestic product in the first quarter rose at a 3.4 percent rate.
Retail sales last month totaled $183.81 billion, 39 percent in durable goods like cars and furniture that posted a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent. Merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes rang up a 2.7 percent gain, while sales at automotive dealers rose 1.3 percent and stores selling furniture and other equipment for the home showed a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent.
Excluding the automotive group, where shortages of some popular models have crimped sales, retail sales rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, the report also showed.
Among nondurables, 61 percent of the total, the only decline, six-tenths of 1 percent, was at food stores, offsetting a May advance.
The sales figures are seasonal, adjusted for holiday and trading differences but not for price changes.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chrysler Has Record Profit Once Again

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HIGHLAND PARK, Mich., July 14

 BODY:
With its profit margins widening on car and truck sales, the Chrysler Corporation reported today that its earnings jumped almost 40 percent in the second quarter, to $956 million, a company record for any quarter.
The auto maker said its profits increased because of an improved mix in its sales: a greater proportion of truck sales, which tend to be more profitable because trucks are in shorter supply, and a declining proportion of fleet sales, which are less profitable because fleets buy in bulk. 
 Chrysler's year-over-year improvement was stronger than the numbers would suggest, because earnings of $685 million in the comparable period a year ago included one-time gains of $109 million from the sale of stock in the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and the sale of some plastics operations.
 "It was a very strong and clean quarter, just like the first quarter," said Michael P. Ward, an auto industry analyst for Kidder, Peabody.
Chrysler surpassed its previous earnings record of $938 million, set in the first quarter of this year. And the auto maker reached that peak on lower revenue: $13.1 billion, up 19.1 percent from revenue of $11 billion in the second quarter a year ago, but down from a record $13.2 billion in the first quarter of this year.
Earnings for the quarter, which ended on June 30, came to $2.61 a primary common share, slightly ahead of most analysts' expectations and well above last year's level of $1.86 a share. On a fully diluted basis, the earnings were $2.35 a share.
Retail sales rose 4.9 percent in the United States in the quarter, Chrysler said. But revenues declined slightly from the first quarter because of factory shutdowns to prepare for new models that restrained sales from factories to dealers.
 
 
15% Market Share
 Chrysler finished the quarter with about a 15 percent share of the United States vehicle market. That is unchanged from a year earlier, because the market has grown.
Investors appeared to have discounted the earnings report well in advance. In heavy trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Chrysler fell 75 cents each, to $49.375. It was the sixth most heavily traded stock on the Big Board.
After soaring for months, the stocks of all three domestic auto makers tumbled early this year, apparently because investors decided that rising interest rates would restrain sales and shorten the auto industry's recovery. But sales have remained strong.
"I think we're going to get another wave in the auto stocks," Mr. Ward said. "There's another two to three years in the cycle."
General Motors and Ford are expected to report earnings in two weeks.
With demand strong, Chrysler, the No. 3 auto maker in the United States, has been steadily shrinking its rebates and other customer incentives, raising its profit on each vehicle. The average incentive offered on each vehicle during the second quarter was $610, down from $1,050 a year earlier and $710 in the first quarter.
 
Older Models Are Cut
 In addition, Chrysler has discontinued some older models like its Acclaim and Spirit compact sedans. Mr. Ward said Chrysler's popular mini-vans, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Ram pickup truck, and LH midsize sedans accounted for 64 percent of the company's output in the second quarter, up from 53 percent in the first quarter.
 Further, the chief financial officer of Chrysler, Gary C. Valade, said fleet sales had declined as a percentage of total sales. For the second quarter, fleet sales accounted for 15 percent of sales, down from 17 percent a year earlier and 20 percent in the first quarter. Under pressure from Wall Street, the Big Three domestic auto makers have been reducing their reliance on sales to fleets.
Before taxes, Chrysler's average profit on each vehicle was $2,160 in the second quarter, compared with $1,350 in the comparable quarter a year earlier and $1,980 in the first quarter of this year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Strong Gains As the Bond Market Rallies

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar staged its biggest gain against the German mark in six weeks yesterday and rose against most other currencies as a bond market rally revived confidence in American assets.
"A little bit of the doom and gloom lifted today," said John McCarthy, foreign-exchange manager at ING Capital Markets. 
 The dollar was quoted at 1.5545 marks in late New York trading yesterday, up more than a pfennig from Wednesday. The dollar also rose to 98.60 yen from 98.30 in New York. The dollar is almost 4 pfennigs above its 20-month low against the mark and 2 yen above its post-World War II low, reached earlier this week.
Even so, many traders were not convinced the recent slump had ended. "The dollar isn't out of the woods yet," Mr. McCarthy said.
 
Retail Sales Slow
 The dollar began its climb when bonds rose on the Commerce Department's retail sales report for June. It indicated that the economy was not growing fast enough to revive inflation, which erodes the value of bonds and other fixed-income securities.
"The dollar fell too far, and the bonds became cheap, so people bought both," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at Chase Manhattan Bank.
Traders also drove the dollar higher after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the Treasury and the Federal Reserve agreed that the dollar must be stronger.
"We're going to continue to be in accord with the Federal Reserve and their objectives to see that we have sustained growth with low inflation and work toward a strong dollar," Mr. Bentsen said.
The Treasury Secretary's comments gave the dollar a lift because many traders interpreted them to mean that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates or buy dollars to bolster the American currency. Higher rates in the United States would make dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
Many traders said the dollar's three-day rally did not mean that it had halted its four-month slide against other currencies. "None of the underlying issues that caused the dollar to fall have changed," Mr. McCarthy at ING Capital said.
He expects the dollar to fall further against the yen unless the United States and Japan succeed in talks aimed at opening Japanese markets. Without such strides, the Japan's $60 billion annual trade surplus with the United States will persist, he said.
Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said yesterday that progress in the trade talks was "very slow" and that negotiators faced "significant obstacles."
The dollar gained against most other currencies yesterday. It rose to 5.3320 French francs, from 5.2815 francs on Wednesday, and strengthened to 1.3117 Swiss francs from 1.3005 francs.
The British pound was quoted at $1.5600 late yesterday, down from $1.5640. The dollar rose to 1,548 Italian lire from 1,526 lire. The Canadian dollar was steady at 72.40 United States cents.

HEADLINE: Merchants See Modest Boom In Business From World Cup

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., July 14

 BODY:
They might not have known a header from a penalty kick, a Baggio from a Romario, but hotels, restaurants, souvenir stands and other businesses in the region apparently had no trouble recognizing the traveler's checks tendered by visitors to the World Cup.
Officials said today that the games at Giants Stadium, the last of which was played on Wednesday night, had pumped $450 million to $500 million into the area's economy, including nearly $200 million in New York City. Those figures landed in the middle of predictions made before the World Cup started here on June 18. 
 But not everyone was happy. Some executives said they had been so caught up in the pre-match hype -- "The most popular sport on the globe!" "Money is no object to these soccer fanatics!" -- that they had overstocked and overstaffed and finished with so-so revenues.
"It was not as significant as we thought, but it was better than we would have done without them," said Therese M. Lewis, director of sales at the 296-room Meadowlands Hilton. "It was not a huge, giant, sold-out-every-night situation, which is what we were told it was going to be two years ago."
 
Disappointment at Hotels
 Other hotel executives on both sides of the Hudson River agreed. They said they had expected most foreign visitors -- who held about one-third of the tickets for the Meadowlands games -- to make reservations. But many of these fans were from Italy and Ireland and were able to stay with relatives or friends in the large immigrant communities in the region.
Still, the hotel occupancy rate for New York City was projected at 74 percent for July, up from an average of 65 percent for that month from 1991 to 1993, the New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said in a report on the economic benefits of the Cup released this week.
Mr. Hevesi said visitors to the Cup spent $63.8 million on food, entertainment and gifts in New York City. Total direct spending was $137.8 million, with an additional $69 million in indirect economic activity, meaning the ripple effect of the increased income earned by workers who provide goods or services to visitors. That produced $9.5 million in city taxes, he said. Altogether for the region, the Comptroller's Office estimated gains of $484 million.
New Jersey issued an early estimate of $460 million for the region, more than half of which was for the state. But officials said the figure might rise after more research was completed, perhaps to $550 million or $600 million. The state's tax coffers reaped $15 million to $20 million, they said.
 
A Lasting Effect
 Gualberto Medina, the New Jersey Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development, said the impact might be greater than predicted before the World Cup because few officials had expected that all seven games in Giants Stadium would sell out, as they did. The stadium seats nearly 80,000.
And Mr. Medina said the Cup would have a lasting effect, noting that with many foreign dignitaries and executives visiting, the state had had an excellent opportunity to sell itself. "The contacts we made with officials from other countries were invaluable," he said.
In Hoboken, which is near the Meadowlands and has one of the highest concentration of bars and restaurants in New Jersey, Mayor Anthony Russo said business had been strong, even though the City Council recently passed some restrictions in an effort to clamp down on rowdy patrons.
"Just a look-see each evening showed most of our restaurants were filled to capacity," Mayor Russo said. "It was sort of atypical because these are the summer months and I don't think their business was that good last year. So it had to be attributable to the Cup."
At the Meadowlands this morning, in a fitting coda to an event that businesses of every sort tried to profit from, pieces of the Bermuda grass playing field were being sold, at $20 a square foot -- perhaps the perfect souvenir for people looking for a surface upon which to display their chunk of the Berlin Wall. The money was donated to the United States Soccer Federation.
 
A Sod Shrine
 One man said he would put the sod next to grass he plucked from the field of Shea Stadium after the Mets won the World Series in 1969. Another customer, Mike Martocci, 31, a firefighter from Fairlawn, N.J., said he would create a shrine by planting his sod (complete with chalk line) in his front yard, roping it off and sticking in some Italian and American flags.
"Right here on this turf Baggio walked and scored and even spit," he said of Roberto Baggio, the graceful Italian star who scored two goals on Wednesday night.
At Giants Stadium on Wednesday, as spectators milled around before the Italy-Bulgaria match, vendors like Warren Dischler, 44, and Joe Lucignano, 43, said they had done well. Mr. Dischler, a contractor from Secaucus, N.J., was so busy hawking soda for $2 a can that he barely had time to talk. "The heat helps you out," he said.
Mr. Lucignano, a bus driver from Hoboken, said he had few complaints, though he did say that he had fallen prey to overly optimistic expectations. He gave a brief lecture on the effect of nationalism on his sales, noting that the early exits of Colombia and Mexico had hurt revenues. There aren't many Bulgarian immigrants in the region, he pointed out.
 
The Local Hard Sell
 And then it was back to work for Mr. Lucignano, who earned about $500 a game, for 12 hours' work selling programs at $5 and $8 each.
"You going to read it or buy it?" he asked Pijush Sen, 45, a visitor from India who might have been unaccustomed to the local hard sell. "You've been looking for five minutes."
"You show me Romario's picture, I'll buy it," replied Mr. Sen, an engineer, referring to the Brazilian star.
"Ah, I got no time for this," Mr. Lucignano said. "I'm trying to make money here. If I talk to you, I don't make money. Come on, the ink's starting to come off that book!"

U S West Seen Near Deal

 BODY:
U S West is close to acquiring two cable systems in Atlanta from a partnership consisting of Robert M. Bass and Lehman Brothers for $1.2 billion, several people close to the transaction said yesterday. A spokesman for U S West declined to comment yesterday.
The planned sale, which was first reported by USA Today yesterday, would mark the transfer of ownership of systems with the largest single concentration of customers in one metropolitan area. The systems -- Wometco and Georgia Cable Television -- have 460,000 subscribers. While the Atlanta market is the country's ninth-largest metropolitan statistical area, it has the third-largest growth rate. 
 U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., would be entering a telephone market controlled by the BellSouth Corporation. The purchase would allow U S West to immediately begin offering cable services and the company is said to be hoping to offer telephony as well.
People close to the transaction said U S West hoped to create a large affiliated group of cable properties and to benefit from economies of scale because of its relationship with Time Warner. U S West owns 25 percent of Time Warner Entertainment, a division of Time Warner that holds Warner Brothers.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
J. P. Morgan's Net Fell 18.8% in 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company, the nation's third-largest banking company, said yesterday that its earnings declined 18.8 percent in the second quarter, below security analysts' projections, largely because of a big drop in trading revenues.
Net income fell to $350 million, or $1.73 a share, from $431 million, or $2.12 a share, in the corresponding quarter of 1993. For the first half of this year, profits dropped 4.3 percent, to $695 million, or $3.43 a share, from $726 million, or $4.27 a share, before the effect of an accounting change, in the comparable period a year ago. 
 Shares of J. P. Morgan fell 25 cents yesterday, to $60, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Trading revenues of $228 million in the second quarter were less than half the $520 million in revenues recorded a year earlier. The company attributed the decline in trading debt instruments, foreign exchange, swaps and other interest-rate contracts to the maintenance of smaller risk positions and "modest positioning losses" in some markets.
"Trading was at the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 1992," said George Salem, a banking analyst for Prudential Securities. "And if you add back the special loss they took that quarter, it would be the lowest since the first quarter of 1992."
 
'A Weak Quarter'
 Raphael Soifer, an analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman, said: "It was a weak quarter for Morgan. But I certainly wouldn't characterize it as falling out of bed."
The downturn at Morgan came on the same day that several regional banking companies -- including the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., NBD Bancorp of Detroit and the Wachovia Corporation of Winston Salem, N.C. -- reported higher earnings. The Bank of New York Company also reported a large increase in net income for the quarter.
But on Wednesday the First Chicago Corporation announced that its profits from trading stocks and bonds in worldwide markets plummeted to $37 million, from $91 million in the second quarter of 1993. And other banks that depend on trading for much of their revenue could also report similar declines.
The J. P. Morgan earnings benefited from several nonrecurring gains. Net interest revenue in the second quarter advanced to $540 million from $424 million but included a gain of $35 million from past-due interest claims on Brazilian assets and $50 million from income-tax revenues.
In addition, the company gained $255 million from the sale of about one-third of its shares of the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation. This represented the overwhelming bulk of the gains of $264 million in equity investment securities recorded in the quarter.
Some banking experts said J. P. Morgan's disappointing results stemmed more from the rising interest rates in the quarter, which caused the stock and bond markets to fall, than from any loss of trading prowess.
"It's indicative of the environment and the markets," said Diane B. Glossman, an analyst for Salomon Brothers. "I think it's just a transitory event."

Shares of the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation surged yesterday after the release of record second-quarter earnings of 75 cents a share, better than analysts' expectations of 73 cents. The lumber and building products company, based in Portland, Ore., attributed its performance to strong housing starts, building permit applications and existing homes sales, indicative of an expanding economy.

N.B.A.'s Ordeal in Court: Is Stern Losing His Touch at the Foul Line?

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The courtroom is familiar territory to the National Basketball Association. The league is fighting for position against a diverse group of legal opponents: the players' union, the jilted buyer of the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the former three-time champions of the league, the Chicago Bulls.
On Tuesday, the league and the National Basketball Players Association, which have hit an impasse in collective bargaining, squabbled in Federal Court in Manhattan over thorny issues like the salary cap, which an emboldened union wants eliminated. The case could be decided today and may have a profound effect on the league's future if the union wins. 
 Meanwhile, a Louisiana state judge in New Orleans yesterday barred the league from printing its 1994-95 schedule until the dispute over the Timberwolves' sale ends. The ruling came despite the N.B.A.'s rejection of the $152 million purchase and proposed move of the team by Top Rank of Louisiana, and despite the fact that a Federal judge in Minneapolis had ordered the Louisiana court to halt all proceedings in the case. The league said it would publish the schedule regardless of the New Orleans ruling.
 
Bulls Ruling Next on Line
 The league is also awaiting a ruling from a Federal judge in Chicago on whether the N.B.A. can restrict or end Bulls broadcasts on WGN, a Chicago-based superstation whose telecasts can be seen on cable systems across the country.
Is the armor of David Stern, once the model of the modern-day sports commissioner, denting? In the post-Michael Jordan era, is Stern becoming vulnerable? Two of Stern's adversaries say no.
"He is still extremely powerful," said Jerry Reinsdorf, the Bulls' owner, who has criticized Stern before the other owners for spending too much of the league's money to fight him and WGN. "Within the league he's still king. He and I had a major disagreement that we can't work out. But it hasn't affected my relationship with him. He's in a position to make life miserable for me, but he doesn't."
Charles Grantham, the executive director of the players' union, said it is the success of the Stern-led N.B.A. that has led to the legal problems. To the list of the league's legal woes, Grantham added the N.B.A.'s failure in court last year to block the Portland Trail Blazers' signing of Chris Dudley to a contract the league believed to be a salary cap subterfuge.
 
'Success Breeding Conflict'
 "I'd characterize it more in light of success breeding arrogance and conflict," Grantham said. "The Chicago and Minnesota situations were cases of owners leaving the reservation. Same with Portland. It's the individual owners, who all used to scream 'we,' now screaming 'me.' I don't know if respect for Stern has changed, but it's individuals looking out for themselves."
Regarding his relationship with Stern, Grantham said: "We're cordial and contentious when need be."
Bad news for Stern, however, was the union's success in getting a temporary restraining order to halt all player signings. Not happy news, either, was Grantham's admission during the trial Tuesday that his idol was Marvin Miller, baseball's former union leader, who outmaneuvered club owners for two decades.
Jan Hubbard, an N.B.A. spokesman, said Stern was not available to discuss the ongoing litigation.
 
Never a Pushover
 Stern's N.B.A. has hardly backed down. The league launched the legal action against the union, believing that it had to do so before the union went to court first. The N.B.A. also sued to stop the Timberwolves' sale, as well as to keep Portland from signing Dudley to a contract whose first year's salary seemed to fit too perfectly into the team's final salary slot at a level well below his market value.
The league was sued by the Bulls and WGN in 1990, and the league has so far lost at every turn in that case.
 Stern himself is an aggressive witness. At Tuesday's one-day trial in the union case, he confidently defended as economic necessities the need to continue the salary cap, the college draft and the right of first refusal, which gives teams a chance to resign their own restricted free agents. He also pressed his belief that this was a labor dispute, not one for the courts to resolve.
 
'How Much Were You Paid?'
 He did not refrain from defending his right to a megasalary, which was awarded to him by owners, without any form of a cap.
Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., a lawyer for the union, asked Stern: "In the year 1990, how much were you paid?"
The query caused two N.B.A. lawyers to leap, in unison, to object.
"I don't object to earning money," the commissioner said.
Schwarz: "How much in 1990? Wasn't it $13.5 million, a $10 million bonus and $3.5 million in salary?"
Stern: "Yes."
Schwarz: "Well, you're making a lot of money."
Stern: "More than I ever thought I would."
Schwarz: "I'm making more money than I thought."
Stern: "How much?"
Schwarz did not reply.

Coaches in Cup Final Do It Their Way

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., July 14

 BODY:
Before Brazil faced Sweden on Wednesday, Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was introduced to what should have been a friendly crowd at the Rose Bowl. Thousands of fans wore yellow shirts and waved the yellow and green flag of Brazil. Parreira was about to lead Brazil to its first World Cup final in 24 years. He would be hailed as a conquering hero, right?
Not a chance. 
 As his name was announced, Parreira was roundly booed. During the game, his face was flashed on the giant television screen at the Rose Bowl, and he was booed again.
At about the same time in Italy on Wednesday, after the Italian team had defeated Bulgaria to gain its first trip to the World Cup finals since 1982, the RAI television network conducted a poll regarding Coach Arrigo Sacchi. Sixty percent of the respondents said that Sacchi's success was based more on luck than skill.
"I don't care if we win or not, at least not like this," said Gennaro Suppa, an elementary school teacher from the southern region of Calabria. "This team hasn't shown me anything."
No two World Cup coaches have been more successful or less appreciated than Parreira of Brazil and Sacchi of Italy. Both have been vilified by the news media in their countries, ripped by fans, dismissed as ignorant in their choices of players and tactics. Parreira's lineup choices were questioned by his own mother.
Somehow, despite overwhelming pressure and skepticism, the coaches have ignored the critics and followed their own muse. In doing so, they have achieved a personal deliverance, accomplishing the very goal their detractors asserted that they could not: reaching the World Cup final on Sunday.
"I kept my way, instead of succumbing to people who don't deserve the freedom to criticize," Parreira said today. "The important thing is for Sacchi and myself to believe in what we are doing and follow that road until the end. I'm happy our way was shown to be the correct way."
Both Parreira and Sacchi are curious, engaging men, and unlike many American football coaches, they have lives outside their sport. Parreira is a painter. Sacchi is an avid reader of politics and economics and of the novels of Faulkner and Steinbeck.
For each of the last three years, Sacchi has spent a month in the United States, getting to know its customs and traditions in anticipation of the World Cup. The son of a shoemaker, Sacchi was never a great player; he rode a slow elevator from the basement of the lowliest Italian division to the penthouse as coach of the national team.
"I am accustomed to suffering and accusations and criticism, to people saying, 'You can't do this, it can't happen,' " Sacchi said in an interview in his apartment in Milan in late April. "I've always been a dreamer."
 
Experimentation With 73 Players
 There were many who accused Sacchi of slipping beyond dreams into delusion. He called 73 players up to the national team in his three years as coach. What he called experimentation, others labeled as bumbling indecision. Last fall, Guerin Sportivo, an Italian soccer magazine, ran photos of all 73 and tossed in other shots of Pope John Paul II, Robin Williams as Popeye and Sylvester Stallone as Rambo to ridicule Sacchi's uncertainty, asking in a mocking headline, "Arrigo, Have You Forgotten Anyone?"
When the Azzurri lost by 2-1 in a spring exhibition against Pontedera, a team in Italy's fourth division, American Oggi, an Italian-language newspaper published in New Jersey, demanded that Sacchi be fired "before it's too late." There was no way he could employ his attacking, pressing style in any coherent manner with only a month's preparation with the national team. Or so the skeptics believed. Clearly, they were wrong.
His glasses forever perched on his balding head, Sacchi had proceeded during the World Cup like some obsessive chemist, his lineups resembling exotic test-tube concoctions. By the semifinals, Sacchi had already used 20 of his 22 players in different starting arrangements. Then he shifted the midfield again for Bulgaria. Sometimes, he has simply relied on audacious spontaneity.
When goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca received a red card against Norway, and Italy was forced to yank a player, Sacchi benched none other than Roberto Baggio, voted the world's best player in 1993. Against Mexico, he brought on forward Daniele Massaro at halftime, and almost immediately Massaro delivered a goal. Against Spain, Sacchi did not start Giuseppe Signori, the leading scorer in the Italian league; Signori came on in the second half, though, and made the pass in the 88th minute that sprung Baggio for the winning goal.
 
Similar Pressure on Parreira
 Parreira, too, has followed his own instinct to great accomplishment, despite relentless criticism. In Brazil, there is an almost magnetic attraction-repulsion relationship between the national team coach and the ravenous news media. In fact, one journalist, Joao Saldanha, was actually named head coach as Brazil prepared for the 1970 World Cup.
"He was such a critic that they decided to make him coach," said Francisco Marcos, the Brazilian team liaison.
Saldanha's tenure came to an abrupt halt when he threatened to leave Pele off the World Cup team, but the point is this: journalists think they know as much about soccer as the coach. And they are not shy in expressing their opinions and demanding changes. Parreira has described his job as national coach of Brazil as a "a compromise, a commitment, a death sentence sometimes."
Parreira, a native of Brazil who previously coached Kuwait in the 1982 World Cup and the United Arab Emirates in the 1990 World Cup, said: "Being Brazil's coach in the World Cup, this is no fun. There's a great deal of responsibility, but no joy at all until you win."
Only two weeks ago, when Brazil drew 1-1 against Sweden, the tie was derided as a "national tragedy" by the Brazilian news media. Pele and Brazil President Itamar Franco suggested lineup changes. Parreira's mother asked him to use Ronaldo, the precocious 17-year-old forward. Parreira suggested that six Brazilian teams be allowed to play in the World Cup. Such an arrangement, he said, "might please half of the people."
 
First-Ever Qualifying Loss
 Parreira suffered the indignity of Brazil's first-ever loss during World Cup qualifying -- a 2-0 loss to Bolivia in La Paz. But, except for benching the enigmatic midfielder Rai -- something the news media had been urging -- he has ignored the critics' howling.
He made the unpopular choice of including defender Branco on the World Cup roster, and Branco scored the winning goal against the Netherlands in the quarterfinals. When Romario became a disciplinary problem, Parreira kept him off the national team for nine months until last fall. He also ignored Romario's calls that his friend Edmundo be included on the roster at forward instead of Muller. Since then, Romario has quit complaining.
"We Brazilians have not recognized the honest work done by Parreira," Romario said on Tuesday. "The Brazilian media should be thankful for Parreira. To put up with what he has put up with, someone like me, I wouldn't put up with it."
Imagine that. A compliment.

HEADLINE: Nigerian Democracy, Under Arrest

 BODY:
Nigeria can be described as a giant-size country under pint-size military rule. A year ago, Nigeria's generals decided to allow their people a whiff of democracy under highly controlled circumstances. Two political parties were formed under military tutelage; two carefully screened candidates were allowed to contest the presidency. Even so, when voters failed to approve the regime's first choice, the military ruler broke his promises, annulled the election and robbed the presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, of victory.
The result has been a grass-roots pro-democratic uprising that the current military clique has been unable to quell. The crisis deepened a few weeks ago when Mr. Abiola, a Muslim and millionaire with a following in Nigeria's non-Muslim south, proclaimed himself President on the first anniversary of the canceled election. For that he was charged with treason, held incommunicado and threatened with a life sentence. When a federal high court judge twice ordered the military to produce Mr. Abiola in open court, the junta ignored the order. 
 Predictably, the effect has been to widen the rebellion. Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, was shut down yesterday by demonstrations, a work boycott and a strike, now in its 11th day, by the powerful oil workers' union. All this has placed the ruling cabal in a wholly untenable position. The demonstrators ask only for what they have been repeatedly promised: a return to civilian rule.
Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and the world's sixth-largest oil exporter. Yet years of misrule have made Nigeria a byword for chaos and cupidity. A once-outspoken press is now stifled, the narcotics traffic in Lagos is brazenly open and a potentially prosperous economy is wasted by a huge foreign debt, bribes and incompetence. The country's best-known author, the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, even fears that "Nigeria will not survive as a nation" unless the current junta steps down and permits Mr. Abiola to assume office.
All this has been noted and deplored in Washington, but without sufficient urgency and passion. This is an occasion for vigorous preventive diplomacy. Americans have the right to warn and to shame, especially given the dramatic democratic transformation in South Africa. If Pretoria's white minority rulers can honor their promise to hold elections and inaugurate President Nelson Mandela, by what reasoning does Nigeria's cabal flout the same principle?

HEADLINE: Save F.H.A. Loans for Needy Families

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is backing legislation that would give more families Government-guaranteed mortgages. Put that way, the policy sounds enlightened. Why then do prominent community housing groups and consumer advocates oppose the legislation?
Their objections flow from a less flattering interpretation of the House and Senate bills: they authorize the Federal Housing Administration to help relatively high-income families. That would help mortgage lenders, whose loans to those families would become risk-free. But it would siphon mortgages from low-income home buyers whom the F.H.A. is supposed to protect. 
 Under the House bill, the F.H.A. would be allowed to provide Government-backed insurance to lenders who provide mortgages up to $101,575; the current limit is $67,500. In high-cost areas like New York City, the limit would be raised to $172,675.
But families would need to earn $70,000 a year or more to afford such mortgages. Most of these families already own houses and do not need help from the F.H.A., whose primary mission is to make a family's first house affordable.
Community housing groups note that raising the F.H.A.'s limits does nothing to make a family's monthly mortgage payments more affordable. And the higher limits will steer lenders away from the less-profitable smaller mortgages that go to low-income families. The bill's sponsors counter by arguing that if the F.H.A. is permitted to cater to richer families, it will cut down defaults and generate profit that could be used to help the poor.
This proposition is dubious. True, the current default rate is high. Lenders of F.H.A.-backed mortgages, protected from default, provide loans with very low down payments. Low down payments invite foreclosure -- and losses for the F.H.A. -- because the families have little equity at stake and the lenders have little incentive to monitor their customers. Indeed, last year over 80,000 families with F.H.A.-backed mortgages defaulted; in some areas, F.H.A. foreclosure rates reach nearly 30 percent.
But if legislation steers families into larger mortgages, it is likely to attract credit-risky families and trigger more foreclosures -- dealing another blow to neighborhood economic revival.
Despite high default rates, F.H.A.-backed mortgages are an important tool for moving financially strapped families into their first homes. For Congress to steer lenders of these mortgages from the needy toward upper-income families serves no public purpose.

HEADLINE: Let Five Senators Forgo Health Care Coverage;
Tax Gas to Pay for It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Assuming that Congress and the Administration can agree on a health care reform package, there will still be the problem of paying for it.
Cigarettes are already one of the most highly taxed commodities but provide far less revenue than would a tax on gasoline, which might also help to reduce health care costs by reducing the risk of another oil-related recession.

HEADLINE: U.S. MAKING MOVES FOR HAITI ACTION

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
While insisting again that a United States invasion of Haiti is not imminent, the Clinton Administration continued today to lay the groundwork for such an action.
Elite Army paratroopers who would probably lead an invasion of Haiti stepped up night training exercises at Fort Bragg, N.C. The Administration announced that 15 countries had signaled a willingness to join a multinational force that would maintain order and retrain Haiti's security forces after the current military government leaves. 
 The exiled Haitian President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, also issued a statement today calling for "swift and definitive" action by the international community to oust Haiti's leaders.
In making known recent military exercises but insisting no invasion is imminent, the Administration seemed to be pressing the Haitian military leaders to leave and also trying to silence critics in Congress who say that the White House is moving precipitately to use force.
A day after the Administration's senior foreign policy advisers briefed Congressional leaders on Haiti policy, Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is an influential voice on military matters, warned the White House to consider any invasion plans "very carefully," and said Haiti is not a "vital" American interest.
At the same time, the Senate today rejected, by a vote of 57 to 42, a proposal by the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, to head off military action by creating a bipartisan commission to study the Haitian crisis, which opponents said would tie President Clinton's hands for months.
The Administration's actions were seen by many in Washington as a final effort to persuade Haiti's military leaders to leave voluntarily so the United States would not have to send troops, a step President Clinton has said he wants to avoid but will not rule out.
The White House continued to insist that it would still rely on strict economic sanctions to drive out Haiti's military leaders. But even as it maintained that position, some 2,000 paratroopers from the elite 82d Airborne Division, which would be in the vanguard of an American military action, held one of the largest rehearsals of an air assault that the unit has had in two years, Army officials said.
The paratroopers are practicing jumping from C-141 and C-130 transport planes, and securing landing zones for troops and equipment that would be flown in later -- the same task the troops would undertake in an invasion of Haiti.
Military officials in Washington and at Fort Bragg, where the 82d Airborne is based, described the two-night exercise as routine training that had been scheduled for two months.
"Honest to goodness, this isn't related to Haiti or any specific scenario," said Maj. Jim Hinnant, a spokesman for the 82d Airborne.
But one Pentagon-based general said that field commanders are now using long-scheduled exercises "to focus on things we need to get down if we invade Haiti."
 
Marines Stage Evacuation
 In addition, more than 4,000 marines staged a mock evacuation for the second day on Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas, about 80 miles northwest of Haiti. They are part of a force of some 2,860 marines posted on Navy ships near Haiti.
"We don't want to comment on the direct purpose of any training that would be going on," the Pentagon spokeswoman, Kathleen deLaski, said. "Some of the things you see going on are related to training that could be used to execute a military option."
Tensions in Haiti and in Washington have risen following the departure from Haiti on Wednesday of 89 international human rights observers who were declared unwelcome by Haiti's military rulers and given 48 hours to leave the country.
In light of these tensions and reports of the military preparations, Father Aristide's statement, while similar to others he has made in the past, seemed to add to expectations of an invasion. The latest comments seemed to contradict those made in an interview with National Public Radio in June, when he had said, "Never, never, never would I agree to be restored to power by an invasion."
 
15 Nations to Help
 The White House said that as many as 15 nations have signaled that they would participate in a multinational force to maintain security in Haiti after the military leaders leave. But the United Nations must still negotiate with those countries to work out specific details of their involvement.
The chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said at a luncheon speech here that countries indicating a willingness to join a post-restoration force include Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Surinam, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras. Ms. Albright said the countries have tentatively committed 2,000 to 4,000 police and trainers.
"They would be there to help with the training of the military and police force, to watch the situation on the ground and to be on hand to make sure that there isn't some upsurge in violence," said the White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers.
Administration officials also said today that Surinam has agreed to join Dominica, Grenada and Antigua in offering safe haven to Haitians fleeing their homeland. Surinam said it could accommodate between 2,000 and 2,500 Haitians.
 
Broadcasts to Haiti
 The State Department announced today that broadcasts, called Radio Democracy, will begin on Friday and will be scheduled for two hours a day -- from 6:30 P.M. to 7:30 P.M., then again from 8 P.M. to 9 P.M. -- on AM 1035 and FM 91.9.
Broadcasts will include messages of reconciliation from Father Aristide and other Haitians, but they will not include appeals for Haitians to halt their attempts to flee in rickety boats, a condition Father Aristide refused to accept.
Administration officials cited what they called encouraging signs that the number of Haitians trying to flee by boat may be dropping.
The State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said that about 2,300, or 30 percent, of the 7,600 Haitians being processed at Guantanamo Bay have chosen to return home. The remainder will be sent to third countries until the Haitian military government is replaced.
 
Warnings From Nunn
 Administration officials said the apparent reduction in the number of Haitians fleeing by boat has given the White House some "breathing space" to decide its next steps. But Congressional officials cautioned Mr. Clinton and his advisers not to act rashly.
"When we're thinking of Haiti, we also have to think of other spots in the world where we have potential problems," Senator Nunn said on NBC's "Today" Show. "Korea is a place where we have a vital interest, and that has to be our first top priority. Bosnia is also important and Haiti is important, but neither Bosnia nor Haiti are vital."
Senator Nunn said that calculation would change quickly if Americans come under attack in Haiti. "Right now, they're not under threat," Mr. Nunn said. "If they come under threat, we have to be prepared to move very rapidly."
Ms. Myers said there were no known threats against the more than 4,000 Americans in Haiti, but she added, "The situation is deteriorating, and I think that makes things more difficult for everyone there."

HEADLINE: How the Chengs Finessed Trump

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 14

 BODY:
It may be one of the last big real estate deals in New York City, but to Henry Cheng, Riverside South, the multibillion-dollar joint venture that could transform Manhattan's largest buildable waterfront land into a community of 16 largely upscale apartment towers along with shops and parks, is just another development.
 "In Hong Kong, China, we've done bigger projects than this, much bigger," said Mr. Cheng, a man parsimonious with words. He and his father, Cheng Yu-tong, have built one of Hong Kong's biggest global property and project development conglomerates, with substantial holdings stretching across Asia and into the United States. 
For the Chengs, Donald J. Trump was not a rival but merely a target of opportunity. Mr. Trump first sketched out the plan for developing the 75-acre site along the Hudson River, blocks from Lincoln Center, but his recent financial problems allowed the Hong Kong group to buy his $250 million debt on the land for a bargain price of some $90 million and take over Riverside South.
 Construction could start within a year, and Mr. Trump will share in the profits. But people familiar with the Chengs' operations agree that they, not Mr. Trump, will call the shots.
 For the Chengs, one of Hong Kong's richest families, with a net worth reportedly about $3.3 billion, the Manhattan project is a minuscule part of their investments, but it is attractive.
 "We think it is a very good investment opportunity," the 47-year-old Mr. Cheng said in an interview in his unostentatious office here. "We think the United States economy has started to pick up."
 "New York is a very slow growth market," he added. "But we believe it has already bottomed out, so we are happy about the existing market. New York is still one of the major cities in the world."
 With land here virtually exhausted, and with extensive interests across Asia, including China, the Chengs have been on the lookout for opportunities in the United States for some time, according to Paul Y. L. Tong, the general manager of the New World Development Company, the centerpiece of the Cheng empire.
 "Previously we have been buying bricks and mortar," Mr. Tong said, referring to the group's vast chain of hotels and residential apartments in the United States, including the upscale Renaissance hotels. "We feel that perhaps this is the right time to do development. We had to look for a partner because we don't know the local situation."
 Because New World does not invest directly in real estate outside Asia, Henry Cheng assembled a consortium of investors to complete the Riverside South deal. "The shareholders are a group of our good friends that got together," Mr. Cheng said. "We bought the debt at a discount." The group also bought the company that owns title to the site.
 "A project of that size is really pin money for these guys," said David Faulkner, a partner at Brooke Hillier Parker, an international property concern with offices here.
 How Henry Cheng's father, Cheng Yu-tong, ascended to the pinnacle of economic power is a familiar tale among the colony's wealthiest families. From his first job, as an apprentice in the Chow Tai Fook jewelry store at the age of 14, he rose quickly to build the largest jewelry chain in Hong Kong. Then he assembleda diversified empire of land, hotels, telecommunications, power projects and roads that branched in stages into China and the rest of Asia.
 
$5.8 Billion Capitalization
 Today, New World, a publicly traded company which the elder Mr. Cheng controls with 35 percent of the stock, has a market capitalization of about $5.8 billion, making it one of Hong Kong's blue chip companies. CTF, as the Chow Tai Fook chain is known, functions as his wholly owned company, and holds his 35 percent share in New World.
 Now 69, Mr. Cheng has built a reputation for hard work and disciplined deal-making. He and his son share adjoining offices in an undistinguished office tower in the central business district, offices that are notable for the lack of opulence so central to Mr. Trump's public image.
 Ever the businessman, Mr. Cheng moved swiftly to build his company's holdings in China in the wake of the June 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, at a time when many investors held back, hurting China's world trade.
He went to school with Li Ziliu, now the mayor of Guangzhou, where New World has major projects. But Mr. Cheng insists that he has never exploited valuable friendships. "Everything must follow the right way," he told The South China Morning Post last year in one of his rare interviews. "I don't like doing things through the back door."
 
Owner of Ramada Hotels
 New World is perhaps the biggest hotel operator in Hong Kong, with two of the colony's best, the Regent and the Grand Hyatt. The company also owns Ramada International Hotels and Resorts in the United States, a concern that includes 45 Renaissance hotels, with one in New York City, and the Stouffer hotel chain. New World also owns hotels in China, Macao, Australia and the Bahamas, and over the next few years is planning new hotels in Taipei, Bangkok, Phuket, Kuala Lumpur, Kota Kinabalu, Manila and Ho Chi Minh City.
 According to Mr. Faulkner, New World's diversification represents much of its strength. New World has major stakes in container terminals and tunnels, owns one of Hong Kong's four fixed-line telephone licenses and is developing road projects in the New Territories, the stretch of the colony that runs to the border with China. The company also has interests in infrastructure projects in China, including power, water plants and the ring road in Guangzhou.
 Central to the Chengs' investment strategy has been the building up of New World's land banks. While his start in the property business focused on Hong Kong, where he controls about 12 million square feet, he has in recent years acquired far more property in China, where New World owns around 20 million square feet of space, analysts here say.
 "China of course is the flavor of the month, but they're not putting all their eggs in the China basket, particularly because the economy there is having a bumpy landing," Mr. Faulkner said. "The very large groups have outgrown Hong Kong."
 Still, Henry Cheng said that New World intended to put about one-quarter of its assets in China. "We believe in China in the long term," he said. Among the group's recent projects is a $580 million coal-fired power plant in neighboring Guangdong Province.
 
High-Tech Buildings
 Joining Mr. Cheng in the Riverside South project is Vincent Lo, the chairman of the Shui On Group, one of the territory's largest construction concerns. Mr. Lo's group is best known for its modern buildings, particularly Citibank Plaza. With its advanced equipment for teleconferences, sophisticated power management and elevators that never leave patrons waiting more than 15 seconds, Citibank Plaza is considered the most high-tech building in Hong Kong.
 Franklin Lam, a property analyst at Salomon Brothers, said it was also outstanding for what is known in Chinese as Feng-shui -- a traditional practice of determining a building's auspicious setting, orientation and furnishing. Feng-shui is important even to very Westernized Hong Kong builders.
 Mr. Trump first came to the attention of the Chengs through their American investment arm, Polylinks International Ltd., Mr. Tong said. "Then three months ago, we knew that the bank was prepared to sell his paper," he said, referring to the $250 million held by Chase Manhattan Bank. "Through a couple of agents, we started looking seriously."
 Neither Mr. Tong nor Henry Cheng would discuss details of the Chengs' arrangement with Mr. Trump, or describe the elder Mr. Cheng's involvment. But, as to the latter, analysts here have no doubts.
 "Cheng Yu-tung is a much richer man than Donald Trump ever was," said Clive Wheedon, a director at Asia Equity Ltd. "I don't believe any of these guys would ever allow a Westerner to drive one of these deals. Most of them regard the Western entrepreneurs as being pretty sleepy. They're not wrong about that."

 CORRECTION:
 An article in Business Day yester day about the Cheng family of Hong Kong, which controls Hong Kong's biggest global property development company, described the Chengs' part nership with the New York developer Donald J. Trump in their joint venture to develop the Riverside South project on Manhattan's West Side.
The headline was "How the Chengs Finessed Trump." Although the arti cle said the Chengs were able to ac quire Mr. Trump's $250 million debt on the Riverside South land at a deep discount, the headline exceeded the facts and emphasis of the article, which was mainly a portrait of the family and its involvement in the project.

Big Charge To Be Taken By Digital

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MAYNARD, Mass., July 14

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation announced today that it would take a $1.2 billion charge for the fourth quarter to cover the elimination of 20,000 jobs and the reduction of 10 million square feet of office and manufacturing space.
The company, which had announced the job reductions earlier, said the cuts would be accelerated and take place over 12 months rather than two years, as had been previously announced. 
 Robert B. Palmer, Digital's president and chief executive, also announced the end of the company's longtime approach to management. "Matrix management at our company is dead," Mr. Palmer said in a conference call with reporters. "For Digital, that statement is monumental."
 
Novel Management System
 Digital's matrix management structure, which became the focus of business school case studies and organizational management books, was an often chaotic and frustrating environment, where decisions were debated endlessly across departments and business units. It fostered internal competition and resulted in many ground-breaking computer systems like the PDP and VAX lines.
The approach, created by Digital's founder and former president, Kenneth H. Olsen, fueled tremendous growth in the 1960's to the mid-1980's.
But Mr. Palmer said such a strategy no longer worked. "That management approach may have been right when Digital was an emerging company, but it has proved to be unaffordable in the marketplace of the 1990's," he said.
Mr. Palmer announced the formation of two new divisions, the computer systems division, to be run by Enrico Pesatori, and the components division, under Charles F. Christ. An advanced technology group under the company's chief technical officer, William D. Strecker, was also established.
Three other business units, including multi-vendor customer services, Digital consulting and semiconductor operations, will be established. In the new organization, Digital will place engineering, manufacturing, marketing and sales responsibilities under each business unit manager.
"These are good moves," said George Colony, president of Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "He's doing the right thing. He's just a year and a half late. He should have done this when he took over."
Some analysts were skeptical about the value of another reorganization at Digital, where at least three such make-overs have been instituted in the last 12 months.
"I don't think the underlying problems in a computer company can be solved by shifting boxes on an organizational chart," said William J. Milton, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
Shares of Digital fell $1.25 today, to $20.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is expected to announce a huge loss on July 25 for the fourth quarter, which ended July 2. The company will take the $1.2 billion charge against that quarter. Analysts had expected the charge to be around $1 billion.
When the job cuts are completed, the company will have a work force of 65,000 people. Digital plans to reduce its office and manufacturing space worldwide to 22 million square feet within two years.
The company is also expected to absorb a noncash expense of $350 million to $400 million associated with intangible assets and other write-offs during the quarter.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE EMPLOYER MANDATE;
Pizza Chain Blocks Critical Commercial

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
A sharp battle broke out today over workers' health insurance, pitting Pizza Hut against Senator Edward M. Kennedy and a coalition supporting President Clinton's proposal for universal health insurance.
The Health Care Reform Project, a coalition of unions and other groups that would require employers to help pay for insurance, held a news conference here to release a report and show a television commercial accusing the company of hypocrisy on health care. The report said Pizza Hut and McDonald's paid for workers' coverage abroad while fighting legislation that would make them do the same in the United States. 
 But the commercial, which discussed only Pizza Hut, a division of Pepsico, will not be shown outside the Congressional hearing room where the news conference was held because Pizza Hut persuaded four Washington television stations not to broadcast it.
The ad shows a young man bicycling toward the nation's Capitol to deliver a pizza. It says that Pizza Hut pays for health insurance for Japanese and German workers, "but for many workers in America Pizza Hut pays no health insurance. Zero."
 
Aggressive Turn in Debate
 The release of the report and the commercial marked an increasingly aggressive turn taken by those who support Mr. Clinton's proposal that employers be required to buy insurance for their workers -- an issue that that remains the central battleground of the health care debate.
The President and allies like Mr. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Labor and Human Resource Committee, contend that without some version of this requirement, an "employer mandate," it will be impossible to achieve health insurance coverage for all Americans.
Much of the opposition has come from small-business organizations, but today's challenge was intended to show that some big companies that have many low-wage workers were also fighting the idea.
"What do they have against American workers?" Mr. Kennedy asked at the news conference today. "Why do they want to to treat Japanese workers, German workers, Belgian workers, Netherlands workers, better than they treat American workers here at home?"
The Labor and Human Resources Committee, responding to the small-business complaints, produced a bill last month with even smaller payment requirements for small businesses than Mr. Clinton had proposed. For businesses with 15 or fewer workers, like many fast-food franchises that are independently owned, employers would have to pay no more than 4.2 percent of a worker's wages for insurance, with additional insurance costs paid by Government subsidies. For someone who worked 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year at the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, the required employer contribution would be $371 a year.
Branches of a chain like Pizza Hut that were owned by a central company, and thus part of a large corporation, would pay more but would still receive subsidies for low-wage workers.
The two Senators from Kansas, Bob Dole and Nancy Landon Kassebaum, both Republicans, sharply rebuked the advertising effort. Senator Kassebaum said the ad showed that the Administration was "desperate." Senator Dole said pizza prices would go to $20 if employers had to buy insurance, far more than either the 10 percent Pizza Hut itself estimated or the 2 percent increase the Health Care Reform Project estimated.
But Pizza Hut, whose headquarters are in Wichita, Kan., thwarted the effort to put the advertising on television in Washington.
 
An Ingredient of Libel
 Rob Doughty, vice president for communications of Pizza Hut, said of the ad, "We regard it as libelous." When asked what part of the commercial was false, an essential ingredient of a libel case, he said he would check with company lawyers.
Later he refused to say whether the ad shown to reporters was libelous. But he said it must have been changed because Pizza Hut had been shown a version that "said we did not offer insurance or pay for insurance for any of our employees."
Mark Johnson, a spokesman for the Health Care Reform Project, said that was not true. "The television ad that was released today is the same ad that we tried to place over the past couple of weeks," he said. "It has not changed at all. There is only one script."
Robert A. Chlopak, a consultant to the coalition who developed the reports and the material for the ad, said the group would buy full-page ads in The New York Times and The Washington Post on Sunday, making the same points in greater detail. The newspapers accepted the ads.
Mr. Doughty did not dispute the statements contained in the organization's report, but he argued that when considered as a whole, the case was "bogus." He acknowledged that Pizza Hut does not contribute to health insurance for hourly employees in their first six months on the job.
He also said that if workers buy a basic plan costing single employees $11 a week, for a period of six months, then the company would make a small added contribution that increases the benefits that hourly workers receive. Salaried workers have a more generous plan to which the company contributes.
In countries like Germany, where insurance is required by law, the company pays but the pizzas cost more, Mr. Doughty said.
He insisted that "the issue for us is employer mandates," and added: "We have been vocal on employer mandates. We are in 87 countries. We have a lot of experience with employer mandates. Employer mandates do not work. All they result in is higher costs to the consumer."
He said a pizza that sells for $11 in the United States costs $19 in Germany and $25 in Japan. But he added that he could not say how much of the increase came from the cost of providing health insurance.
In Germany and Japan, Mr. Doughty said, Pizza Hut restaurants are in high-rent areas, unlike most of those in the United States. And the need to import ingredients like tomato sauce and cheese also contributed to higher costs, he said.
When Mr. Doughty was asked how much he thought the Clinton plan would add to the cost of a pizza, he replied: "In the first year about 10 percent. But in later years it would go up substantially more. So God knows what's the cost."
But Eric Sklar, who runs a chain here called Burrito's, appeared at the Health Care Reform Project news conference and said it was unlikely that any legislation would raise prices by more than 2 percent. Matching the plan Mr. Clinton proposed, he said, would probably force him to add 7 or 8 cents to the cost of a $4 burrito.
Mr. Sklar also said he would like to insure his workers fully, but added, "I have to compete with Taco Bell," which, like Pizza Hut, is owned by Pepsico. "If I insure my employees," he said, "I am at a competitive disadvantage."
A spokesman for the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee also said he doubted the Pizza Hut estimate. Under legislation approved last month by the committee, employers of low-wage workers would not have to pay the full cost of their health insurance.
Under that bill, a large company like Pizza Hut would have to pay no more than 12 percent of a worker's wages for insurance premiums. For a minimum wage, 40-hour employee, that would come to $1,061 a year. But labor is only one of Pizza Hut's costs, and so the impact on its prices would not have to be that great.
Pizza Hut owns the majority of its outlets in the United States. It owns 4,720, where it would have to pay 12 percent for insurance under the bill. An additional 2,715 Pizza Hut stores are franchises, where lower rates, down to 4.2 percent, would prevail, as would be the case in a number of the 535 licensee operations.
 
What the Workers Think
 Interviews around the country with fast-food workers -- when Pizza Hut managers did not chase reporters away -- showed a widespead desire for insurance coverage.
Rosie Rodriguez, who makes $2.90 an hour plus tips, was interviewed at a Pizza Hut on Atlantic Avenue in the New York City borough of Queens. She said she had no health insurance and thought it was unfair that the company covered employers abroad but not at home
"That's messed up," she said. "They should be doing it here, too. They don't care about people here, I guess. If I get sick I have to pay, and I can't afford it."
In Los Angeles, a waitress who gave her name only as Jannette said: "Of course we should have the right to health insurance. As years go by, everything is more expensive, so for the sake of our health, maybe they should increase the prices."
In Houston, a 37-year-old Pizza Hut employee with three children who gave only his initials, M.G., said, "Pizza Hut can afford to give insurance to its people." He had no insurance, but said he had occasionally received free medical care from a doctor to whom he delivers pizza.
No employees at McDonald's were permitted to give interviews, and the company itself was similarly uncommunicative. Requests for comment on the Health Care Reform Project report's charge that "McDonald's can well afford to pay for health insurance for their American workers," were answered with only a generalized statement.
It said, "It's unrealistic and misleading to single out any one benefit or program without considering the entire economic and social environment of each country."
The Health Care Reform Project sought to show the ad on four Washington stations. At WUSA-TV, Barbara Ware, manager of press and publciity said she had no comment when asked why the ad had not been shown. At WTTG-TV and WJLA-TV, spokesmen promised to call back but did not despite repeated requests. AT WRC-TV no one would comment.
The Health Care Reform Project released correspondence between the group and Michael S. Horne, a lawyer with Covington & Burling here who represented Pizza Hut. Mr. Horne sent a copy of his letter, accusing them of producing a commercial "that states or implies that Pizza Hut offers no health insurance program for its employees in the United States. That statement is false."
He concluded by warning that "if you cause to be broadcast any statement to the effect that Pizza Hut does not offer health care coverage for its employees in the United States, the company will regard that false broadcast as having been made with knowledge of falsity or in reckless disregard of falsity."
The falsity language comes from decisions on what constitutes libel, although Mr. Horne did not use the word "libel."
He sent copies of his letter to the four television stations and to two others that the Health Care Reform Project was not dealing with. WUSA-TV sent a copy of the letter to the health care group with a note saying, "Until some resolution is made relative to the counterstatements in this letter, WUSA will not go forward and air the spot."

HEADLINE: Aristide Calls for Reconciliation on His Own Radio Station

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 15

 BODY:
Speaking to his countrymen via a new radio station set up specifically for his use by the Clinton Administration, Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, tonight called for "reconciliation, justice and democracy" in his homeland and forswore revenge against the soldiers who removed him from office.
Vowing to return to Haiti soon, Father Aristide promised that "there will be no violence" when he comes back. "I will not accept any vengeance," he said. 
 The deposed President avoided any mention of Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who led the coup that ousted him in September 1991. But he assured the "little soldiers who are the backbone of the army" that he did not want to punish them.
"You the soldier, you don't have to be scared," Father Aristide said.
He also sought to calm businessmen who view him as a radical, saying that he respected the Haitian Constitution and the right to make a profit.
"The Constitution is as clear as coconut water," he said. "Everybody is equal," he later added. "Everybody must respect the law."
Father Aristide's 50-minute address was the first item broadcast by the new American-sponsored radio station, called Radio Democracy. The speech was beamed to listeners on both AM and FM frequencies by two American C-130 aircraft flying above Haiti. It will be followed by daily radio programs featuring Father Aristide, his supporters and spokesmen for United States foreign policy.
 
An Indefinite Period
 Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the United States Embassy here, said the broadcasts would continue for an indefinite period.
The idea of setting up a radio station for Father Aristide's use was first made public last month, but the launching of Radio Democracy was delayed because Father Aristide proved unwilling to urge Haitians not to flee their country in small and rickety boats, a proposal Washington had been hoping he would endorse.
Since then, the United States has tightened economic sanctions against Haiti and more than 20,000 would-be refugees have taken to the seas and been intercepted by American Coast Guard vessels. On July 5, the United States announced it would not resettle such Haitians in the United States, but would send them to safe havens in third countries.
Father Aristide's initial speech on Radio Democracy was awaited with great curiosity and anticipation here, since his position on basic aspects of the Haitian crisis has varied greatly in recent months. After saying in January that he would support a surgical strike by an international force to oust the military regime now in power, he reversed himself last month, saying, "Never, never, never would I agree to be restored to power in an invasion." This week, however, he demanded "swift and definitive action" against those who ousted him.
Though Father Aristide went into exile after his overthrow, his comments on events here still are sometimes broadcast on Haitian radio stations, as well as by the Voice of America's Creole-language short-wave service. Mr. Schrager said Radio Democracy offers the deposed President an advantage over that arrangement because his remarks will not be "subject to de facto control or censorship" by local authorities.
Mr. Schrager said that American officials would not exercise "direct censorship" of Father Aristide's broadcasts, which will be made in Creole. However, scripts will "be screened by the United States before they go on the air," he said.
Following Father Aristide's refusal to urge Haitians not to flee their country, the United States set up a radio station of its own to point out the dangers of boat trips and to explain American policy toward Haitians rescued at sea. That station is already on the air two and a half hours a day, broadcasting on an AM frequency from planes flying above the neighboring Dominican Republic.
The Haitian Government did not appear to have jammed Father Aristide's broadcast, and had no immediate comment about his appeal to soldiers and businessmen. Reception of large parts of the speech was weak and unclear, especially on the FM band, where the frequency chosen is sandwiched between one station playing pop music and another with religious programming in English.

HEADLINE: Dow Advances by 14.56, But Chip Stocks Sell Off

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The stock market moved mostly higher yesterday in a sluggish session highlighted by options-related trading and a sharp selloff in semiconductor shares.
Most of the rise in prices came late in the day, and was tied to expiring options contracts. Earlier in the session the market was up only modestly, despite a set of economic reports that were generally well received in the bond market. 
 "It was a fairly dreary summer Friday," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers. "Basically, everybody who needed to get things done got them done on Thursday."
On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average, which rose by more than 34 points on Thursday, gained 14.56 yesterday, and closed at 3,753.81. For the week, the blue-chip index gained 44.67 points. Big Board volume was 275.9 million shares, down sharply from the 322.3 million shares traded on Thursday.
 
Broader Index Gains
 Broader indexes eked out smaller gains. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by just 0.75, to 454.16. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.51, to 431.55. But the Nasdaq system's composite index dipped by 0.20, to 721.36.
Computer problems shut down the Nasdaq system until almost noon yesterday, and the delay created some problems for stock index traders who were trying to square positions ahead of the options expiration.
But the day's biggest shock was in semiconductor stocks, which fell sharply after an executive at Texas Instruments suggested that demand for computer chips might not be as strong in the second half of the year as it was in the first.
The comments from William A. Aylesworth, the company's chief financial officer, accompanied the release of Texas Instruments' second-quarter earnings, which were up 64 percent, a bigger increase than analysts had expected.
Traders were much more interested in Mr. Aylesworth's suggestion that while evidence of slowing demand had not turned up yet, given the strong first half, it was "mathematically" likely that the second half would see growth slip.
After Mr. Aylesworth's comments became public, shares of Texas Instruments started to tumble. The stock closed at 80 1/4, down 6 1/8, on heavy volume.
Concerns about Texas Instruments' as yet unseen problems still managed to drag down other semiconductor stocks.
Motorola, which earlier this week reported big gains in its second-quarter earnings, fell 1 3/8, to 48 7/8. Intel lost 2, to 59 1/2. Micron Technology dropped 1 7/8, to 36 1/4. And the Altera Corporation, which said it expected its revenue growth in the second and third quarters to be roughly half what it was a year ago, lost 6 1/2, to 25 1/2.
"The fact that the market reacted the way it did to what Texas Instruments said shows that some people are still nervous," said Laszlo Birinyi, head of Birinyi Associates, a market research company in Greenwich, Conn.
 
'Treading Water'
 Still, Mr. Birinyi said he thought the market was "O.K."
"What you are seeing is some consolidation and treading water after a fairly significant correction in the first part of the year," he said. "But the fact that the market didn't sell off on a summer Friday following a very good day is a good sign."
Among the day's big gainers were chemical stocks, which moved higher in anticipation of stronger earnings. Du Pont gained 1 1/4, to 60 1/8; Dow Chemical was up 7/8, to 67 3/8, and Eastman Chemical rose 1, to 49 1/4.
Oil stocks also posted good gains. Chevron was up 7/8, to 44 7/8; Amoco added 3/8, to 60 5/8, and Texaco gained 3/8, to 63 1/8.
In Tokyo yesterday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 52.11 points, or a quarter of 1 percent, at 20,770.15. On Thursday, the Nikkei rose 177.63 points.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE CAMPAIGN;
Clinton, on the Stump, Opens a Final Health Care Push

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GREENSBURG, Pa., July 15

 BODY:
President Clinton today began a vigorous and probably final crusade to sell his national health insurance program to voters and Congress, flying to rural Pennsylvania to assert that the program would be a boon to the middle class and that its critics were all but liars.
Standing in shirt sleeves, flushed in the vapory heat, Mr. Clinton punched the air and pounded his lectern as he argued, again and again, that working people were the only ones who would suffer if his plan to guarantee health insurance to everyone did not become law. 
 "The politicians have it," he said of guaranteed insurance. "The wealthy have it. The poor have it. If you go to jail, you have it. Only the middle class doesn't have it, and I don't think that makes much sense."
He alternated that populist appeal with attacks on supporters of rival plans like that of the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, that would fall short of covering everyone. "Let's not burn the middle class," Mr. Clinton exhorted the crowd. "Let's cover everyone and make America work."
 
Monthlong Drive Begins
 His speech, to a throng of several thousand people next to the old courthouse in this hilly county seat outside Pittsburgh, opened what is certain to be a frenzied month of health care campaigning by Mr. Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and virtually every top official in the Administration.
Most officials in Washington say that the House and the Senate must pass health care legislation before their four-week recess begins in mid-August if any plan at all is to become law this year. And Mr. Clinton's chances of enacting the sort of plan he favors, everyone agrees, will diminish after November's elections, in which Republicans are expected to gain Congressional seats.
Mr. Clinton will take up health care again next week in speeches to the National Governors Association in Boston and to the Hispanic group La Raza in Miami. Mrs. Clinton is expected next week to inaugurate a nationwide caravan of buses that will converge on Washington in August, carrying advocates of universal insurance coverage. Cabinet officials are besieging the editorial writers of most major newspapers this week, and the Democratic National Committee has begun a $4 million advertising campaign to generate support for the President's proposal.
The Administration is hampered because it lacks, as yet, any paper-and-ink legislation that it can hand the public. Competing and contradictory bills have emerged from four Congressional committees, and Democratic leaders in both houses are trying to write a single plan that would insure everyone, as Mr. Clinton demands, without driving away lawmakers who fear that guaranteed insurance would simply cost too much.
 
Pitch to the Middle Class
 Everyone agrees that no plan can cover all Americans unless the Government raises taxes, forces employers to pay much of the cost of insurance for all their workers and those workers' dependents, or requires individuals to buy it themselves. Mr. Clinton favors requiring payments by employers -- the so-called employer mandate -- but the idea is anathema to most Republicans and not a small number of Democrats.
The White House's strategists have decided that the best way to flip those lawmakers to the Administration's side is to convince the sea of voters who regard themselves as middle class that universal insurance coverage would save them worry and money. And that was the theme that the President underscored today.
His speech, like those in coming weeks, had two aims. One was to convince middle-class crowds that this was their chance to benefit from a Government program. The other was to defuse opponents' increasingly effective contention that Mr. Clinton's ideas would limit Americans' medical care options and hurt the economy.
So Mr. Clinton, the champion of the very poorest during his days as Governor of Arkansas, worked unusually hard today to suggest that the poor had received their share, mostly at the expense of his audience, and that it was time for the middle class to reap some Federal rewards.
He was preceded to a dais of pine two-by-eights, covered in blue bunting, by two women whose stories were tailored to his argument. One was a 62-year-old farmer, Louise Mastowski, who said she could no longer afford insurance and feared that she would fall ill before becoming eligible for Medicare.
The second, Lynn Hicks, is a mother of five children who lost her insurance after her husband had lost his job. She later fell ill with breast cancer and had to quit her own job and join the welfare rolls to receive medical care.
"Now, they've worked all their lives, they've paid for their health insurance," Mr. Clinton said of those women and other cases he cited. "They haven't done anything wrong. There are 600,000 people in Pennsylvania alone in the same boat."
 
Attacks Fear of Rationing
 Similarly he battered away at fears that guaranteed insurance would force the health care system to hold down costs by rationing medical services. For people like Ms. Hicks, he noted, medical care is already limited.
Mr. Clinton also mocked accusations that his plan would turn the medical system over to the Government -- in fact, he argued, his proposal is less intrusive than the existing Medicare system -- and that it would cripple small businesses by raising their insurance costs.
In Hawaii, which has long used an insurance system like the one the White House favors, insurance rates for small business are 30 percent lower than in the rest of the nation, Mr. Clinton said.
The crowd of a few thousand who heard him today, along with the several thousand who lined the eight-mile route from the local airport to Greensburg, seemed almost wholly receptive to Mr. Clinton. This is heavily Democratic territory in a state whose one Democratic Senator, Harris Wofford, swept to victory in 1991 on a wave of unhappiness with Republican diffidence toward health care reform.
But at the airport, where Mr. Clinton spent 18 minutes shaking hands and signing autographs, there was some suggestion that he still needed to convert even the faithful to his health care crusade.
As Mr. Clinton worked a fence row of cheering onlookers, one of them, 39-year-old Jim Kuhn, grabbed the President's hand and told him to "just keep pushing." Later, Mr. Kuhn said he lost his steady sales job about a year ago, received no coverage from his current work and had to buy "awfully expensive" insurance on his own while he looked for a better job.
Mr. Kuhn said the President had told him that the Administration had created four million jobs so far. But "my concern is with his health care plan," he said. "I don't know if there are going to be four million new jobs available if they pass this. With this employer mandate, it's going to close a lot of jobs down."

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Surplus Up

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 15

 BODY:
Robust exports to the United States and Asia helped to raise Japan's trade surplus by nearly 15 percent in June, the Government said today. That is higher than most economists had forecast.
 The Finance Ministry said the overall surplus rose to $11.35 billion from $9.88 billion in June 1993. Japan's surplus with the United States widened to an unadjusted $4.73 billion from $3.30 billion a year earlier. 
 In the first six months of 1994, the total surplus widened to $60.01 billion from $57.12 billion a year earlier. The surplus with the United States rose to $24.56 billion from $21.56 billion in the first half of 1993.
 A strong United States economic recovery and dynamic growth in Asia helped exports to grow 10.4 percent over all in June to $33.67 billion. Export volume also rose 6.3 percent after declining from February through May, economists noted.

HEADLINE: How a County Buried $52 Million;
A Landfill Site Falls Afoul of Environmental Concerns

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GOSHEN, N.Y.

 BODY:
For $52 million, Orange County has constructed a garbage landfill that will never be soiled by garbage. Indeed, in the decade since the project was proposed, taxpayer money is the only thing that has been poured into the 34-acre site.
The state permits required to operate the would-be landfill expired in early July, and the County Executive, Joseph G. Rampe, has announced that he will abandon the project entirely. Mr. Rampe, who took office in January, says that to operate the landfill now would only mean throwing good money after bad. 
 Depending on whom you ask, this is either the story of a county caught between onerous state and Federal wetland regulations or a victory tale for the environmental movement.
Either way, the story has an expensive ending for the nearly 300,000 people who live in this county of graceful farms and struggling cities. Their taxes have gone to pay for a garbage landfill they will never use.
"Right along, it seemed that the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing in terms of our environmental laws," said Robert Weinberger, president of the Goshen Taxpayers Association and a former mayor of this county seat. "It has been a series of poor decisions that led us down a path of waste of the taxpayers' money."
A long, winding path it has been.
In the days when garbage was dumped in a hole in the ground, covered with dirt and forgot about, the county bought 300 acres of land from the state and was given a permit to use 245 of those acres for garbage. That was in 1973. The county cleared its first 75-acre portion and began filling it with garbage.
By 1984, when space began running out in the first section, the laws had changed and the county had to reapply to the State Conservation Department for permission to expand. Among the state's changes were tighter restrictions on landfills, like Orange County's, that sit over an aquifer. The regulations are intended to protect ground water from contamination.
It took four years and several design proposals, but in 1988 the state approved a temporary 34-acre landfill expansion plan. The state allowed the county to use the 34 acres for garbage until July 7 of this year, giving time to find a permanent, and drier, home for solid waste.
The county went ahead and spent $36 million building a double-composite, double-lined landfill, and agreed to pay an additional $16 million in interest on the bonds that financed it.
But there was another fly in the ointment -- Federal regulations for wetlands -- and this, county officials contend, was something state officials had never mentioned when they approved the building of the temporary landfill. The property is covered with cattails and other wetland plants that qualify it as a wetland under Federal regulations, though not state regulations. The state regulates patches of wetland larger than 12.4 acres. The Federal Government regulates any wetland larger than an acre.
"It could have taken one simple phone call from the Department of Environmental Conservation to explain the Federal process to the county," said Scott Thornton, an apple farmer turned lawyer who was the one who discovered the suspected violations of Federal law and sued Orange County in Federal court. "But no, the state says: 'We don't get involved in that. Those are Federal laws.' "
 
Went to Law School
 Mr. Thornton went to law school to fight the landfill, which was just across the Wallkill River from his in-laws' apple orchard. It was in class that he found out about the Federal Government's wetland regulations.
"I knew those were wetlands being filled in because the apple orchard started getting flooded along the river and that hadn't happened before," Mr. Thornton said. "I went to the state, but they said the property wasn't on their wetlands map."
In December 1991, Mr. Thornton, as a member of a community group, Orange Environment Inc., sued the county in Federal court, saying it needed a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to fill in Federal wetlands. In January 1993, a Federal judge agreed that they needed Army corps permits.
Rather than start again from scratch, Mr. Rampe, the County Executive, wants to bury the landfill issue and concentrate on putting together long-range plans for getting rid of the garbage that it is now shipping out of state.
 
New Requirements
 For one thing, Mr. Rampe says, there is a hefty new set of Federal requirements to meet, and the time limits on the state's operating permits have expired. But the main reason for Mr. Rampe's pessimism is purely economic.
Without even counting the initial $52 million cost, he says the landfill would still be a financial loser.
He estimates that the landfill could generate, at most, $40 million in landfill revenue but could cost more than $41 million to run. The costs include completing the landfill and operating, capping and monitoring it. The cost of seeking Federal wetlands permits and new state operating permits, both of which would probably face legal challenges, would only add to the losses.
Even many taxpayers seem resigned to accept the expensive hole in the ground.
"Wisdom would suggest that they don't pursue it any further," said Edward P. Scharfenberger, a retired lawyer and president of the Orange County Coalition of Taxpayers. "Right now, I'm interested in long-term solutions to the solid-waste problem."

HEADLINE: Flood Threatens to Wash Away Dreams

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Ga., July 14

 BODY:
Almost every black person here over 40 remembers the fervor and exultation, the hymns and protest songs, the sense of a new world just over the horizon that suffused this river city more than 30 years ago, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached the gospel of freedom at the old Mount Zion Baptist Church.
But when the flood came this week, when the chocolate-colored water poured over the largely black river-bottom neighborhoods of low-slung cinder-block duplexes, dirt yards and old wooden houses in faded greens and blues, it was a bitter reminder of how fleeting that long-ago moment was. 
 It was black neighborhoods that were hit hardest by the historic flooding that washed over east and south Albany, many of them full of people who had taken only the first steps out of rural poverty here in the pecan and peanut country of southwest Georgia. And as the waters began to recede, many blacks in this city, where their per capita income is about a third that of whites, were wondering if they were about to be slammed right back down to where they began.
"I had a nice apartment, I had running water, I had it all," said Kimberly Jones, who remembers the buckets of water used for toilets and sinks at the home where she grew up near the small town of Camilla, not far from Albany. At 21, Ms. Jones was trying to rear her three children in a neat little apartment 16 feet from the Flint River and hoping to go back to school to study nursing. Now, with the apartment inundated, "I feel like I'm standing on the bottom of a deep hole, looking up at the sky."
 
One-Fourth in Poverty
 Albany, founded in 1836 by a Quaker from New Jersey who named it for Albany, N.Y., has about 80,000 people, about 55 percent of them black. A quarter of the population lives in poverty, and the murder rate is one of the highest in the nation.
The population of the metropolitan area, which includes rapidly growing, largely white suburbs in nearby Lee County, is about 120,000, and the flooding forced as many as 20 percent of them to evacuate. With the water only now receding, the extent of the damage is still unclear.
For blacks here, much has changed for the better since the days of the Albany Movement, the crusade to integrate the city in the early days of the civil rights struggle.
The Police Chief is black, and so is the Fire Chief. During the flood, one of the busiest people in town has been the young black assistant city manager, Janice Allen. There are blacks scattered across the white neighborhoods on the west side of town, and blacks serve on the boards of the local banks.
These days, class can mean at least as much as race here.
Henry Mathis, a black former city commissioner who was active in the Albany Movement as a child, said the city had at least four distinct classes.
"You have the Doublegate whites," he said, referring to a wealthy white neighborhood on the west side. "You have the Albany State College blacks. Then you have the industrial workers, and then you have the poor whites and poor blacks."
 
A City of Delineations
 But whites still hold the balance of political power on both the City Council and the County Commission, and they hold almost all the economic power. Those at the bottom tend to be overwhelmingly black. Median household income for whites is $30,943; for blacks it is $13,252. Per capita income for whites is $16,157, for blacks $5,904.
At Red Cross shelters jammed with poor blacks this week, like the one at Dougherty High School on the hard-hit east side or the one at Albany High School on the west, the city's social and economic delineations were plain to see.
There were welfare mothers from the flooded-out Washington Homes project, the working poor and those clinging to a ledge near the low end of the lower middle class.
Ronnie Soilberry was earning $147 a week as a maintenance worker before the flood waters inundated his home. It wasn't luxury, but it was a lot better than his parents' generation had known.
"I'm not slopping hogs, picking cotton, chopping timber, hauling wood," he said. "I think I'm doing pretty good. Or I was, before this hit."
 
Help From Government
 There are many others, now staying at local motels or with relatives and friends, who have come a long way, to jobs at hospitals, government offices or the Procter & Gamble or Miller Brewing plants. At 72, Rosa Rogers remembers the days of outhouses and kerosene lanterns; her life then is a long way from her daughter Emma's now.
Mrs. Rogers is retired from a candy factory, and her husband, now dead, owned a shoe repair business. Her daughter is a blood technician at a local hospital, and her son-in-law is a custodian at Dougherty High School. The three lived together in a three-bedroom brick house that was inundated, and they should be eligible for some of the $65.5 million in Federal aid available to the victims of the recent Southeast flooding. The Government will provide low-interest loans of up to $200,000 for real estate damage and $40,000 for personal property damage, and grants of up to $13,200 to flood victims who cannot repay loans.
Husher B. Smith Jr. earns $34,000 a year driving a truck for a local chemical company. His wife is a beautician. Their income is enough to make payments on a $42,000 house and to own three cars. The house and two of the cars were flooded, but he is already thinking of how to use Federal relief money to get back to where he was and perhaps buy a rental unit as well.
"Most people here got no plan," he said, surveying the crowd at a Red Cross shelter. "They'll take whatever money they get, buy a car or party and be back worse than they were. My idea may be as wrong as 1, 2, 3, but at least I got a plan to get back on my feet, so I'm not worried about getting there."
 
'The Lord Is Angry'
 You can hear lots of explanations for why things have not progressed further here.
"I think the Lord is angry," said Linda Luster, flooded out and worn out, at a Red Cross shelter at a middle school. "Everyone is doing wrong, and He's tired of it. Blacks are doing it to survive. Whites are doing it just because they can do it. He's tired of it. He's just tired."
Everyone talks about the devastating toll of drugs. Many see a culture of dependence, from the fields to welfare, that has left many blacks so accustomed to life on the bottom that they have trouble imagining anything else.
Otis Boyd, who has had various jobs over the years and now earns $10,000 a year as a custodian at Albany State College, blames employers who use temporary instead of full-time workers to avoid providing benefits.
Black businessmen say banks remain reluctant to lend money to them.
"A black is always going to be on the bottom, because he's never going to be able to go and secure a loan to start his business completely," said Nick Walker, who used $1,500 in savings from his full-time job to start his own window-tinting business seven years ago. "It can wear you out. But I still wouldn't give two blocks of Albany for any town. We have our racial problems and our personal problems, but we can clear it up."
If there is a comfort, to many it is the knowledge that they have always made do, even in the face of adversity.
There is Charlotte Hendricks, who came South from Newark because she did not want to rear her son there. She has worked two or three jobs at a time and expects to do so again.
"I've been up, down, up, down, up, down so much, I figure I can get back up again," she said, a thin woman in a pink top and blue jeans, smoking a cigarette after getting off work at a pecan shelling plant. "When I left New Jersey I had nothing but my children and my clothes, and I worked two jobs until I got something. I don't want to sound cocky or anything, but I'm a survivor. If I have to get two jobs or two and a half, I'll do it, and be O.K."
If the dreams of the Albany Movement seem a thing of the past, the individual dreams, tattered and waterlogged as they may be, live on.
"This will pass," said Mr. Soilberry, sitting on a cot in the gym at Albany High School. "I'm going to have everything I want. Plenty of money. My kids are going to go to college. I'm 33 years old, but I have a dream. I'm not going to stop hoping. I'm going all the way to the top."

HEADLINE: Bonds Fail To Extend Their Rally

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The bond market failed yesterday to extend Thursday's strong rally, ending the day with little change after giving up its early gains.
"The market has trouble holding the gains," said James Kenney, head trader at Prudential Securities. "I will continue to treat it as a rally in a bear market." 
 The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 4/32 of a point, after trading up as much as 18/32 of a point in the morning. Its yield, which moved in the opposite direction of its price, edged up to 7.54 percent from 7.53 percent. On Thursday, the long bond's yield fell 14 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, its biggest decline since May.
Prices of shorter- and intermediate-term Treasury securities also slipped.

 The bond market was once again unsettled around midday by rising commodities prices, considered by some analysts to be a leading indicator of inflation. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity prices rose 1.77 points, to 233.50.
It seemed to ignore comments by the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, that inflation appeared to be under control. "The U.S. economy has recently been experiencing the ideal combination of rising activity, falling unemployment and slowing inflation," Mr. Greenspan told a Congressional panel.
 
Favorable Economic Reports
 Earlier in the day, the bond market had reacted favorably to a Government report showing a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in June industrial production, reinforcing earlier reports demonstrating moderate economic growth and almost nonexistent inflation.
So far this year, the Consumer Price Index has shown an annual inflation rate of 2.5 percent, down from 2.8 percent for the first six months of 1993 and 2.7 percent for all of last year.
"I don't really see any whiff of inflation," said Anthony Chan, senior economist at the BancOne Investment Advisors Corporation, which has about $8 billion in fixed-income investments.
The Fed also said the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 83.9 percent of capacity in June, slightly above expectations. Even though economists associate a rate of 84 percent or 85 percent with more inflation, low inflation so far this year means that "we can tolerate a slightly higher level of capacity utilization," Mr. Chan said.
 
Utilities' Role Discounted
 The gain in the Fed's production survey did not set off inflation alarms because much of it came from utilities, which produce more electricity during the summer, analysts said.
The production number "might look a little scary, but the fact that it was mostly utilities should soften the blow considerably," said James Hale, senior fixed-income strategist at MMS International in San Francisco. "Because of the much warmer weather, everybody turned their air- conditioners on."
Still, some traders were not surprised that the bond market's rally stalled.
Thursday's "performance was impressive, but so many times in the past we've seen that, spending a day or two days grinding higher, only to give it back in a heartbeat," said Chris Madell, a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Texas Instruments: Net Up, Outlook Down

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 15

 BODY:
Despite record revenues and earnings at Texas Instruments Inc., the company's forecast today that the runaway growth in chip sales in the first half of the year would slow caused investors to flee the stocks of chip makers.
Earlier this week, the semiconductor industry reported its first monthly decline in orders since September, amid signs that corporate demand for personal computers that use the chips was beginning to slacken. 
 Texas Instruments executives and industry officials said, with some annoyance, that they saw continued strong growth. But some analysts said the latest reports were a sign that the chip boom had crested.
"It's pretty much assumed there will be a slowdown in the second half of the year,' said Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst for Argus Research. "But the market hasn't valued this into the stocks.'
At least not until today. Texas Instruments, the bearer of sobering news, fell $6.125, or 7 percent, to $80.25. Other chip makers suffered, but somewhat less.
Texas Instruments executives said they expected the year's worldwide chip demand to grow by a few percentage points more than the 21 percent increase they initially predicted. But after 25 to 30 percent growth in the first half of the year, they said, the second half would inevitably be slower.
The chief financial officer of Texas Instruments, William A. Aylesworth, was not about to panic or jump out of a window. "I'm doing fine -- I can assure you of that," he said. "My office is on the first floor.'
Texas Instruments said its earnings from operations for the second quarter were $292 million, up 69 percent from $173 million in the comparable period last year. Sales rose 19 percent, to $2.51 billion. Earnings per share of $1.93 were higher than the analysts' consensus by about 5 cents.
These records came primarily as a result of the company's chip making, about 60 percent of a business that also includes military electronics, calculators and laptop computers.
"It was a superb earnings report," said Rajiv Chaudhri, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs. "Squeaky clean.'
Mr. Aylesworth noted other encouraging signs, including lower chip inventories at its customers and especially strong demand from Pacific Asian markets outside Japan. "The forces driving longer-term growth remain intact," he said.
As for the United States, he said he saw moderating economic growth, and less likelihood that PC demand, especially from corporations, would continue its rapid growth.
A corporate shopping spree for technology has helped propel efficiency and economic growth higher during the last two years. But many businesses, courted with round after round of price cuts, have almost all the computers they can use. Some analysts said corporate buyers had also slowed their rush to upgrade their machines.
But a spokesman for the Intel Corporation, another leading chip maker, said its sales to computer makers continued to outstrip its expectations. The company is scheduled to report its earnings on Monday.
Earlier this week, the Semiconductor Industry Association reported that chip orders fell 2 percent and the book-to-bill ratio fell 4 percent in June from the month before. The ratio compares orders booked with those shipped and billed, and a declining ratio indicates slower growth.
Doug Andrey, the group's chief statistics keeper, said he saw only a seasonal pattern, noting that the ratio usually declined in June.

HEADLINE: Greenspan View of Deficit

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today that the United States was experiencing ideal economic times but warned that future prosperity was jeopardized by the nation's giant budget deficit.
"The U.S. economy has recently been experiencing the ideal combination of rising activity, falling unemployment and slowing inflation," Mr. Greenspan told a bipartisan commission on Government spending and tax reform. 
 But he made clear that the nation must not let good economic times create an atmosphere in which policy makers take a view that the deficit, despite improvement, is no longer a critical problem. "We cannot let this good behavior lull us into neglecting the underlying problems of our economy," Mr. Greenspan said.
He said the impact of the deficit was pervasive and continued to keep long-term interest rates high, making it more costly to finance the red ink.
"Long-term interest rates are higher now because markets are anticipating rising deficits in the next century," he said.
At the same, he said he detected a sharp shift in the public's attitude toward the deficit and a willingness to make hard choices to bring the economy into better balance.
"I hope and really do believe" progress will be made, Mr. Greenspan said, adding that improvement would show up in interest rate levels.

HEADLINE: DISCOUNTS;
Deals for Older People If They Will Just Ask

BYLINE: By Andree Brooks 

 BODY:
GROWING older has an upside for those who aren't shy about discussing their age.
More and more companies are trying to capture the elderly market by offering discounts and special deals to older people. The topic may bring early-bird dinner specials and movie discounts to mind, but much bigger returns are available. Financial services companies and even the Internal Revenue Service offer tax breaks based on age. 
 Many of the discounts go unclaimed because eligible people fail to speak up. "A ticket agent isn't going to ask, 'How old are you?' Neither is your insurance agent," said Joan Rattner Heilman, author of "Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You Absolutely Can't Get Unless You Are Over 50" (Contemporary Books, 1994, $7.95). Reticence about telling your age is likely to hurt your purse more than your image, Ms. Heilman added, because the definition of older people keeps expanding to include younger people. No longer tied to the Social Security benchmark of 62 years, discounts for older people are often available at age 50.
Consider Thrifty Car Rentals. It used to limit its 10 percent discount to members of the American Association of Retired Persons. In March, it began offering the discount to anyone over 55.
Geico Insurance of Washington goes a step further. Policyholders over 50 who are retired receive a discount of 5 to 25 percent on homeowner and automobile insurance premiums, depending on the policy. Retirees are loosely defined as people working fewer than 20 hours a week.
An additional 10 percent off auto premiums is given to older people willing to take an accredited defensive driving training course (offered in many communities by the American Automobile Association). All of Geico's auto discounts end at age 74.
A veritable bonanza of deals can be found in the travel industry. The most widely known are the airline programs. Coupon programs for older travelers have been expanding as rapidly as frequent flier programs did in the early 1980's. "It's one of the really great deals," said Ed Perkins, editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
Once confined to a handful of major carriers, coupons are now available from smaller airlines, like Kiwi. Older people can buy books of 4, 8 or 10 coupons in advance, good for travel anywhere in the continental United States. On average, the cost works out to $270 for each round-trip flight, generally lower than promotional fares, Mr. Perkins said.
Though travel may be limited to weekdays and advance booking may be requried (or waived for anyone willing to fly standby), the fares do not require a Saturday night stay, the mainstay of most promotions.
In a new offer, Continental Airlines announced this week that it would give people over age 62 up to 75 percent off full-price coach fares. Under the program, those eligible will pay $314 for a one-way trip from New York to Los Angeles, versus $693 for a younger traveler. Other airlines offer flat discounts of 10 percent for people of a certain age.
 The Internal Revenue Service gives the elderly a break, too. In 1993, the standard deduction for a single taxpayer over 65 was $4,600, compared with $3,700 for others. Married couples over 65 who filed jointly were allowed a standard deduction of $7,600, instead of $6,200. If one spouse was younger than 65, the deduction fell to $6,900.
Figures for the 1994 tax year are not yet available, because they are adjusted for inflation at the end of the year. Taxpayers who itemize are simply out of luck.
Some states have gotten on the bandwagon. New Jersey, for example, permits any taxpayer over 65 to determine taxable income and then subtract $1,000 before calculating taxes owed. (New York and Connecticut do not offer elderly discounts.)
Credit card issuers, including American Express, reduce annual fees; municipalities cut fees for recreational use; hotels discount rooms; colleges lower tuition. Considering the wide range of discounts, it may be worth making it a practice to ask about age breaks. For people who may be embarrassed, the extra money in the bank may ease the sting.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

I.R.A. Beneficiary
Q. When a spouse is the beneficiary of an I.R.A., can the spouse add a child as beneficiary after the account owner dies?
MILTON GREENWOOD, Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
 
A. As the beneficiary of an individual retirement account, a spouse can either receive distributions or roll over the account into another I.R.A.
If the account is rolled over into the name of the surviving spouse, it is considered a new I.R.A. The spouse can then name a beneficiary, which may be a child or grandchild.
If a younger person is named as beneficiary, minimum distributions can be stretched out by using the combined life expectancies of the account holder and the beneficiary.
"During the surviving spouse's lifetime, there is a special rule that limits to a maximum of 10 years the age difference that may be taken into account in the joint and last survivor life expectancy calculation," said Jeffrey L. Keyser of Deloitte & Touche. "So if the surviving spouse is age 70 1/2 and the designated beneficiary is age 40, the lives for purposes of determining minimum distributions would be 70 1/2 and 60 1/2."

Evaluating Annuities
Q. What sources evaluate variable annuities?
JOYCE FISCHMAN, Norwalk, Conn.
 
A. There are almost 300 variable annuities and a much larger number of fund subaccounts, or possible investments, from which investors can choose. Information is provided by Morningstar, Lipper Analytical Services and the Variable Annuity Research and Data Service, among others. Performance data and fee comparisons are also published periodically in some newspapers and magazines.
"Investors should look significantly beyond performance data when considering variable annuity products," cautioned Kurt Cerulli, a Boston consultant. "Consider whether the contract has a guaranteed death benefit, the ease of moving money among subaccounts, minimum guarantees on fixed accounts and withdrawal waiting periods."

Price-Earnings Ratio
Q. What is a price-earnings ratio?
JOHN J. HOWLEY, Rockaway Park, Queens
 
A. A price-earnings ratio, or P/E, gauges how
expensive a stock price is relative to a company's earnings per share. In general, lower P/E ratios are considered better than high ratios.
The traditional way to calculate P/E ratios, the one used in newspaper stock tables, is the trailing earnings method, in which the current price of one share of stock is divided by the company's earnings per share over the last four quarters. The alternative method is to divide the price by the earnings per share projected by analysts for the next four quarters.
"The ironic thing regarding P/E ratios is that the trailing earnings method actually works quite well," said Richard Bernstein of Merrill Lynch. "Stock-picking methods based on P/E ratios tend to underperform during recessions, because out-of-favor stocks usually become even more out-of-favor during bad economic times."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Yen, But Holds Firm Elsewhere

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen yesterday, ending a two-day rally, after Japan said its trade surplus with the United States had surged 43 percent in June.
But the dollar remained steady against the German mark and other currencies as Treasury bonds held onto recent gains. 
 "The trade numbers reminded people that many of the reasons for the dollar's decline are still around," said Michael Faust, portfolio manager at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., money-management firm with $1 billion of assets.
A swelling Japanese trade surplus means Japanese exporters have more dollars to sell for yen when they return revenue to Japan. Also, it adds to traders' fears that the Clinton Administration will prefer to keep the dollar weak in order to make American exports cheaper overseas.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 97.86 yen, down from 98.60 yen on Thursday. It had been rebounding after hitting a record low of 96.60 yen on Tuesday, but traders said the trade figures unnerved dollar buyers.
 
'Surplus Continues to Grow'
 "The trade numbers were horrible," said David De Rosa, director of foreign exchange at the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose to $4.73 billion in June from $3.3 billion a year earlier.
Many traders say the dollar will remain weak against the yen until the United States succeeds in narrowing the trade gap with Japan.
"I'm not buying the rhetoric that the dollar has fallen to its lows for the year," said Steve Flanagan, a currency trader at Paine Webber Inc. "The trade figures show Japan's trade surplus continues to grow."
Meanwhile, the dollar was little changed at 1.554 marks as Treasury bonds held on to most of the gains they made Thursday. Currency traders watch the performance of Treasury bonds closely for clues of whether international investors are returning to dollar-denominated investments after dumping them earlier this year.
The dollar traded at the week's high of 1.5615 marks at midday as bonds rallied on further signs that the economy was not growing fast enough to generate inflation.
But the dollar later retreated after Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, told a Congressional panel that inflation was slowing and gave no indication that interest rates would be pushed up soon. Some currency traders had been looking for a rate increase to support the dollar.
Elsewhere, the British pound rose to $1.5613, from $1.5602 on Thursday. The dollar fell to 5.3280 French francs from 5.3310 francs, but it rose to 1,550 Italian lire from 1,549 lire. And the Canadian dollar rose to 72.60 United States cents from 72.36 cents.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Jumps 0.5%

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Industrial production rose five-tenths of 1 percent in June as unusually hot weather forced a big surge in utility output, the Government said today.
The Federal Reserve said that without the higher utility use, production rose only one-tenth of 1 percent last month, matching the overall increase for May. Production at factories, mines and utilities has risen for 13 consecutive months. 
 In another report, the Commerce Department said business inventories rose 1.1 percent in May, the largest increase in nearly seven years. The gain, which was larger than expected, was the fourth advance in the first five months of the year and the biggest since inventories rose 1.3 percent in October 1987, the department said.
 
Operating Rate Soars
 Plants were operating at 83.9 percent of capacity in June, up three-tenths of 1 percent, after declining one-tenth of 1 percent in each of the two preceding months. The operating rate for June was the highest in five years, but the Fed noted that the stepped-up output at utilities more than accounted for the gain.
The Fed watches the figures for signs of inflationary pressure. The increases in output and operating capacity were larger than expected, but because they were related to the weather, did not appear to signal that the economy was growing rapidly enough to feed inflation fears.
Still, most economists have predicted that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year no later than Aug. 16, when the Fed's policy makers are scheduled to hold their next meeting.
The operating rate matched a peak set in June 1989. A high rate could mean that production limits are being reached and that shortages will result, leading to higher prices and wages.
The most recent data suggest that the economy is in a period of moderate growth after a strong expansion in the final months of last year.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making body of the Fed, declined to increase interest rates when it met last week despite concern about the declining value of the dollar on currency markets. The dollar has stabilized since then.
 
Annual Pace Slows
 The Fed said industrial production in June was 5.8 percent higher than it was a year ago, and output grew at an annual rate of 4.4 percent in the second quarter, down from a rate of 8.3 percent in the first quarter.
The slowdown was mainly a result of slower car and truck production, the Fed said.
The output of consumer goods rose six-tenths of 1 percent in June, after slipping one-tenth in May. Business equipment was up five-tenths of 1 percent, after a rise of six-tenths. Construction supplies rose two-tenths of 1 percent, after a May advance of four-tenths.
Utility production soared 5.4 percent in June, after gaining nine-tenths of 1 percent in May. That more than offset a drop of five-tenths of 1 percent in mining, which had fallen 1.2 percent in May. At factories, production rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, after slipping a tenth in May.

HEADLINE: A Confidence Index Falls Confidence Index Falls

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment for July fell to 88.9 from 91.2 in June, people with access to the report said yesterday.
"While a drop was expected, the extent of the fall was a surprise," said Dana Sorrentino, an economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. "We assume it reflects the turmoil in the stock and bond markets in early July." 
 Also helping to fuel concern was speculation that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates to head off inflation, Mr. Sorrentino said. The Fed has raised the Federal funds rate -- what banks charge each other for overnight loans -- four times this year, to 4 1/4 percent.
The consumer confidence index is based on 100, set in 1966. When the monthly reading increases, consumers are becoming more optimistic about the economy. Since 1966, the record high for the sentiment index is 101, set in March 1984. The record low is 51.7, set in April 1980.
The university also said its July index of current economic conditions rose to 106.0 from 104.5 in June.

Good Job, But Good Riddance

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

 BODY:
ONLY one month and one day after Mike Keenan held the Stanley Cup aloft, he put a dent in it. And in his credibility.
Insisting he was a "free agent" because the Rangers "failed to honor the obligations of my contract," the only Ranger coach to kiss the Stanley Cup since 1940 kissed the franchise goodbye yesterday. The kiss was not returned. 
 As a coach, Mike Keenan deserves to be hailed for having done a good job. As a man, he deserves good riddance.
Look now for the Ranger lawyers to challenge Keenan's self-described free agency. In court, if necessary.
According to a Madison Square Garden statement, the Rangers were one day late in paying Keenan's playoff bonus. Keenan seemed to be using that as an excuse to leave, possibly to join the Detroit Red Wings as coach or general manager, if not both -- a deal he repeatedly denied despite persistent reports during the last week of the Stanley Cup final.
The night the Rangers won the cup, Keenan was asked again about the Detroit deal.
"As I said yesterday and as I said three days ago," he insisted, "it's nonsense."
Not everybody believed him. When the Rangers gathered two days later for their formal Stanley Cup photo, Bob Gutkowski, the president of the Garden, disclosed that he had alerted Commissioner Gary Bettman that if Keenan were to join the Red Wings, the National Hockey League should investigate.
Keenan, after all, joined the Rangers a year ago for a five-year contract reportedly worth $5 million. But he has always been the restless type.
 Despite his Ranger contract, Keenan talked vaguely every so often during the season about his interest in "new challenges." He also talked mysteriously about having spurned a firm offer from another N.H.L. club a year ago in order to join the Rangers.
In retrospect, was that offer from the Red Wings? And when the whispers about the Red Wings first surfaced, he issued what was known in the Nixon administration as a nondenial denial. He later hardened his denials.
Another factor added credence to the Red Wing deal: Keenan and Neil Smith, the Rangers' general manager, had a tense, strained relationship.
Gutkowski's putting Commissioner Bettman on alert was important. If the Red Wings are eventually found to have tampered with Keenan, especially with a Stanley Cup-winning coach, the Rangers would deserve quality compensation in players, draft choices or cash, if not all three.
But if Keenan could prove a breach of contract, he could slide into hockey's unemployment line for a few weeks or a few months, then join the Red Wings.
"I'm open to anything that might be out there in the N.H.L.," he said yesterday at his news conference in The Sports Network television offices in Toronto. "I'm on the open market and I'd like to coach in the N.H.L. again."
In choreographing his departure, maybe Keenan knew he could never top what he accomplished here: winning the Stanley Cup in his only season as the Rangers' coach.
In the four remaining seasons of his Ranger contract, anything less than winning the cup would be considered a failure. His reputation could only melt like so much ice. And with several aging players, maybe he thought the Rangers would not be able to win again next year. But a "new challenge" elsewhere would give him time to win.
Keep in mind that the Red Wings, stunned by the San Jose Sharks in the recent playoffs, are what the Rangers were a year ago: a talented team that needs only another player or two to win the cup.
Say this for Keenan: He's a good coach. Mark Messier has called him "the best coach I've ever played for," high praise considering how long Messier played for Glen Sather in the Edmonton Oilers' dynasty.
In the Rangers' only season with Keenan behind their bench, the players responded to his hard, demanding style. They finished first over all and won the cup. But would they respond so obediently now that they have won it?
And for Keenan, a "new challenge" would exist in Detroit. Of the six N.H.L. franchises before expansion nearly nearly three decades ago, the Red Wings, who last won the Stanley Cup in 1955, now have replaced the Rangers as the team that has endured the longest drought without champagne in hockey's silver punch bowl.
As the Red Wings' coach, Mike Keenan would have the opportunity to be a savior in Detroit just as he was a savior here. At least for one month and one day. But with his machinations, Mike Keenan must now be considered a deserter.

NASA SELECTS SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT DEVELOPERS

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation have been selected by NASA to lead a team developing technologies for the next generation of supersonic transport aircraft. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the contract was valued at $880 million. Seattle-based Boeing said the contract was for a planned eight-year second phase of NASA's high-speed research program, intended to develop key technologies required for a new high-speed transport. Boeing said studies had shown that supersonic travel could be economically feasible and that demand existed for transportation that could cut flying time between New York and Paris or Los Angeles and Tokyo in half.

HEADLINE: Bennington Redesign Returns to Roots

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re 'How Downsizing Diminishes Bennington" (letter, July 5) by Debra Hecht and Anaheed Alani, Bennington College graduates: Literature, foreign languages and musical instruments will continue to be taught at Bennington and in ways that offer greater breadth and depth. 
 In keeping with a shift to a faculty composed of teacher-practitioners, literature will be taught by poets, writers of fiction, essayists and playwrights, a change that signals a return to the times when W. H. Auden, Howard Nemerov, Bernard Malamud and John Gardner taught the great works at Bennington.
All foreign language learning will be relocated out of the college into a new regional language learning center; languages taught will include Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian and Spanish (two more than were previously offered).
Music will be taught by professionally active composers, and the teaching of musical instruments beyond those provided by composers will be supplemented by the abundant resources of the Bennington community -- a community that may not be considered cosmopolitan by some standards, but one that offers an impressive roster of professional musicians and even its own symphony.
Art history, sociology, politics and economics have been eliminated as distinct areas of study, but all continue to be part of Bennington's curriculum; they will now be taught as a part of the study of art, history, philosophy, anthropology and psychology.
Bennington's redesign includes the dissolution of the traditional departmental structure; the prospective abolishment of presumptive tenure; a tuition-linked fund to encourage faculty innovation, and collaborative, cross-disciplinary faculty program groups as the primary academic structure. This dramatic redesign has received major support from foundations and alumni.
The human costs of such change are indeed great.
During the 1993-94 academic year, the faculty numbered approximately 80 full- and part-time teachers, a number that translates to a full-time equivalent of 61.5. The changes displaced 20 of those 80, although some will continue to teach at the college for 1994-95. When the 1995-96 academic year begins, the college expects to have a full-time equivalent of 50 faculty members, or 11.5 fewer than during 1993-94.
A college is indeed an "intricate institution, whose character derives from history"; the board of trustees evidenced that belief in making the difficult choices that led to the college's redesign -- a redesign that not only returns Bennington to the principles of its founding and its place as a leader in innovative education, but also offers students the richest possible academic experience at a cost that aims to go down in the foreseeable future.

HEADLINE: Pataki Raises $2.2 Million For Campaign

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 15

 BODY:
In the latest sign that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo faces his most credible election challenge since 1982, Senator George E. Pataki disclosed today that he had already raised far more money than was spent by the Republican gubernatorial nominees in either 1986 or 1990.
Although Mr. Cuomo has raised more than twice as much as Mr. Pataki and has almost triple Mr. Pataki's cash on hand, it is largely because the Governor began the year with a $3 million war chest. During the last six months, Mr. Pataki has virtually kept pace with Mr. Cuomo's fund raising. 
 Mr. Cuomo, who is seeking his fourth four-year term, has raised $2.2 million since mid-January, when the last disclosure report was filed, and Mr. Pataki has raised about $2 million. The Governor has raised a total of $5.16 million for his 1994 campaign and has $3.55 million on hand, while Mr. Pataki, a freshman Senator from Putnam County, has raised $2.2 million and has $1.3 million on hand.
The 1990 Republican candidate, Pierre A. Rinfret, spent a total of $1.1 million, while Mr. Cuomo spent $5.1 million. The Governor's 1986 opponent, Andrew O'Rourke, spent $1.3 million to Mr. Cuomo's $6.8 million. Mr. Cuomo won both races easily.
Besides what he has raised on his own, Mr. Pataki also has benefited from a $400,000 pledge from his political patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. New Yorkers for D'Amato, a committee formed by Mr. D'Amato last year when he was considering running for governor, has spent about $250,000 so far to pay expenses incurred by the Pataki campaign, said Zenia Mucha, Mr. D'Amato's spokeswoman.
Both sides are predicting the campaign will be hugely expensive. Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, Caroline Quartararo, said she believed her candidate would need $13 million. Joel R. Benenson, Mr. Cuomo's spokesman, said the Governor "will raise whatever is needed to win."
Perhaps those happiest about the expected cost of the campaign are the candidates' top political consultants. Mr. Cuomo's filing showed that David Garth, his media adviser, is receiving a retainer of $25,000 a month. Arthur J. Finkelstein, who has served as the prime strategist for both Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato, received $137,236 since June, with most of it paid by Mr. D'Amato's committee.
Since being nominated at the Republican state convention in May, Mr. Pataki has spent much of his time raising money. His aides said today that their fund raising had gained momentum both from publicity surrounding the convention and from recent polls showing him in a close race with Mr. Cuomo. They predicted that they would collect another $2 million at a fund-raising dinner scheduled for July 25 in New York City.
"The polls show that we can win," said Ms. Quartararo. "It's nice to have positive stories in the paper when you're trying to raise money."
But Mr. Pataki may yet face a costly primary against Richard M. Rosenbaum, a former state Republican chairman, who is seeking to get on the ballot through the petitioning process. He has raised a total of $1.72 million and has $582,000 on hand, said Lisa Linden, his spokeswoman.
And some Republican officials say the Pataki campaign has had trouble soliciting contributions from the numerous political action committees that have interests in Albany. That, they said, is because the committees do not wish to alienate the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican who controls the flow of legislation in his house.
 
Waiting on Marino
 Mr. Marino did not support Mr. Pataki's nomination and has yet to settle a longstanding political feud with his Republican colleague. Although he agreed to serve as chairman of Mr. Pataki's July 25 event, Mr. Marino has very deliberately declined to endorse him. At least one Albany lobbyist said his firm had advised clients with PAC's to delay giving to Mr. Pataki until Mr. Marino clarified his stand.
Mr. Cuomo, who abhors fund raising and typically has limited his solicitations to a few major dinners a year, has been seeking contributions aggressively this year, both in and out of New York. He has received significant help from President Clinton, who appeared at a Manhattan fund-raiser last month that collected $1 million for the state Democratic committee. The President is to be the main attraction at another Cuomo fund-raiser in Washington this month.
The state Democratic committee reported that it has raised $1.32 million to help support campaign efforts across the state, including the gubernatorial campaign, and has a balance of $755,000. The state Republican committee has $247,000 on hand.
Some of Mr. Cuomo's largest contributors were investors and developers like Zachary Fisher ($28,000), Bernard H. Mendik ($26,000), Leon Black ($25,000) and William H. Mack ($23,000). He also received major donations from longtime friends and associates, including $25,000 from Vincent Tese, his economic development commissioner; $10,000 from the law firm that includes Herman Badillo, a former Congressman and Deputy Mayor of New York City; $10,000 from Evan A. Davis, his former counsel; $10,000 from Meyer S. Frucher, a longtime confidant, and $10,000 from Howard J. Rubenstein, the public relations executive.
Mr. Cuomo also received numerous donations from individuals, firms and political action committees that have interests with the state. Labor unions were particularly generous, as was the Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin, which is involved in negotiations with the state over tribal land claims in central New York. It gave $4,900.
Mr. Pataki received sizable contributions from the real estate developer Abraham Hirschfeld ($10,000), the financier Carl C. Icahn ($12,000), the cosmetics executive Ronald S. Lauder ($20,000), and a Rochester supermarket magnate, Robert B. Wegman ($20,000).

CORRECTION-DATE: July 19, 1994, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about fund-raising in the race for New York's governorship misstated the period in which Arthur J. Finkelstein, the prime strategist for State Senator George E. Pataki's campaign, has received $137,236 in fees from the campaign. It has occurred since January.

HEADLINE: At Deadline, Deal to Develop Site Of New York Coliseum Collapses

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
A nine-year effort to redevelop the New York Coliseum crumbled last night when the developer, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, failed to meet a deadline to sign a contract with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the Columbus Circle site.
The chairman of the M.T.A., Peter E. Stangl, said that with Mr. Zuckerman out of the deal, the authority was now free to begin exploring options for the redevelopment of the site. This, he said, will most likely include some sort of interim use involving a modest upgrading of the exhibition hall and office building, rather than immediately seeking a new development project. 
 Although the deal between Mr. Zuckerman and the transportation agency survived numerous challenges and court battles, Mr. Stangl said last night that he could see no way it could be revived now. And the Giuliani administration, which had pressured the agency to complete a deal with Mr. Zuckerman, indicated last night that it was ready to give up the fight.
"We would have preferred the project to go forward on schedule," said Cristyne F. Lategano, the Mayor's spokeswoman. But she added that the city had already collected Mr. Zuckerman's $17 million nonrefundable deposit and that moving ahead with new plans would be "far better than years of litigation and consequential delay."
But Mr. Zuckerman's partner, Edward H. Linde, said that he and Mr. Zuckerman were seriously considering bringing a suit against the M.T.A. "We did not pay $17 million without thinking that we would develop the property," Mr. Linde said. "They have taken our money and they have deprived us of our right to develop."
From the beginning, the deal for the Coliseum -- one of the highest-profile development sites available in Manhattan -- has been buffeted by court battles, mayoral politics and the vagaries of the real-estate market. But last month it appeared that a project would finally go forward at the Coliseum, at Columbus Circle and 59th Street, when Mr. Zuckerman agreed to build a one-million-square foot office building on half the site, for which the M.T.A. would have received $100 million.
Besides the $17 million down payment, Mr. Zuckerman, by failing to sign the contract by last night's deadline, stood to lose millions more that he had already spent to sustain his interest in the project, which he won the right to develop in 1985.
The negotiations fell apart despite an 11th-hour effort by John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, who employed a sort of shuttle diplomacy between the two sides as they struggled to write a contract acceptable to both parties.
The deal between Mr. Zuckerman and the transportation authority collapsed, people close to the negotiations said, with an impasse on several crucial issues, including the degree of personal liability of Mr. Zuckerman and his partner, Mr. Linde, for various aspects of the project.
Negotiations, which had been proceeding nearly around the clock in the last few days, broke down four hours before the midnight deadline. Last night each side was accusing the other of acting in bad faith.
"Whether you are talking about security, the separation of the building or our general participation, not one single main issue had been settled," Mr. Stangl said. "We were working but nothing was being resolved. Maybe it could have happened if they had gotten to the negotiating table earlier."
 
1989 Deal Revised
 But Morri Berman, a spokesman for Mr. Zuckerman, said the agency's representatives had spoiled the deal by demanding more assurances, including an assumption of personal liability by the two principals.
"They never wanted to do the deal in the first place," Mr. Berman said of the authority.
The plan announced last month, a revision of an 1989 deal, would have given the transportation authority $100 million for a piece of land where the exhibition hall now stands. Mr. Zuckerman was to pay $80 million, with the $20 million balance coming from the city.
Last night the principals of Boston Properties, Mr. Zuckerman's company, accused the M.T.A. of imposing unreasonable standards on the deal and acting in bad faith.
"The M.T.A. acted in bad faith from day one," said Mr. Linde. "By their actions they have blocked us from converting our $17 million cash payment into equity in the new development." He said the M.T.A. imposed unreasonable standards on the transaction by, for example, demanding significant improvements to the office building that were not called for in the letter of intent, which was signed by all parties on June 2 and set the general terms of the contract that was be signed by July 15.
Mr. Linde said it was not the tardiness of Boston Properties or its lawyer that delayed the negotiations, but additional demands by the M.T.A.
"In instance after instance," he said, "they overreached the terms of the letter of intent, required additional financial commitments and imposed standards and obligations that deviated from the letter of intent."
Mr. Linde accused the M.T.A. of "trying all along to torpedo the deal."
Mr. Dyson said he was extremely disappointed by the collapse of the agreement, mainly because of the construction and development jobs that would be lost. But added, "We are better off having the 17 million in cash instead of a lawsuit."
Although the M.T.A. owns the site, whatever happens at the Coliseum will require the approval of the city.
Mr. Dyson also said he felt the M.T.A. had been unreasonable in some aspects of its interpretation of the letter of intent. He specifically referred to the M.T.A. requirement that Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Linde make personal guarantees for various aspects of the redevelopment project.
"They insisted on personal guarantees that are not normal in business deals of this kind," he said.
 
Council Member Assails Deal
 Among the critics of the Coliseum agreement was Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Democratic member of the City Council whose Upper West Side district includes the Coliseum. Ms. Eldridge criticized the Giuliani administration in particular for pressuring the M.T.A. to make a deal with Mr. Zuckerman. Ms. Eldridge suggested on several occasions in the last few months that the Mayor's aides were assisting Mr. Zuckerman, in part, because the newspaper he owns, The Daily News, endorsed Mr. Giuliani in the mayoral race last November.
"We won't be selling this valuable piece of land for the lowest price," she said, "and we won't be breaking it up. So I would hope the administration would give thought to the design of the Circle in a way that can result in plan that suits the neighborhood and one that will involve real jobs, not just construction jobs."
Redeveloping the site became a goal of the city when the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, larger and more modern than the Coliseum, was planned. The Javits Center opened in 1986 and became the city's premier convention hall.
It was nine years ago that Mr. Zuckerman, Mr. Linde and Salomon Brothers won the competition to replace a tired-looking exhibition hall and office building with a development of offices, apartments, stores and restaurants. They agreed to pay $455 million for the property.
But a series of lawsuits over the size of the project kept it in limbo for seven years. Salomon Brothers withdrew in 1987.
In response to criticisms of the size of the proposed tower, Mr. Zuckerman scaled down his project and the M.T.A. lowered the price on the property to $338 million. The last lawsuit was cleared in September 1992, making way for a closing of the 1989 deal.
But Mr. Zuckerman tried to negotiate a lower purchase price, arguing that the depressed real-estate market would make the project impossible.
After months of negotiations, during which several deadlines for a closing on the deal were set and then extended by one side or the other, they agreed on a development plan for half the site.
 
CHRONOLOGY
The Coliseum Site
 
July 1985 -- After a brief but intense struggle among several developers the Metropolitan Transportation Authority selects Boston Properties, headed by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, to revitalize the site of the New York Coliseum by building a 2.9-million-square-foot residential and office complex. The sale price is $455.1 million, which is planned to be used for subway improvements.

 September 1986 -- Three community boards in Manhattan disapprove Zuckerman plan amid growing opposition in the neighborhood. Critics say the project would be too tall and bulky and would be out of scale with the surrounding Columbus Circle.

 December 1987 -- Salomon Brothers, a co-owner and principal tenant of the project, withdraws amid widespread layoffs in the securities business. Developer vows to press ahead, saying, "I am bullish on New York and bullish on the Coliseum project."

 January 1988 -- City and M.T.A. agree to new price of $357 million.

 June 1988 -- Mr. Zuckerman scales down the plan with shorter, thinner towers that will include 500,000 fewer square feet than the original proposal. Mr. Zuckerman calls it an "extraordinarily exciting architectural solution" to neighbors' concerns.

 April 1989 -- In an effort to resolve legal and administrative challenges, the project is redesigned again, and the price is cut to $338 million. It now calls for 2.1 million square feet of space, and the tallest tower would be 175 feet shorter than in the original plan. Community boards voice support of new plan.

 May 1989 -- Board of Estimate approves the 59-story project.

 September 1992 -- Federal appeals court rules that the project would not violate Federal Clean Air rules, clearing away the last legal obstacle.

 November 1993 -- Boston Properties submits its final proposal, cutting the space to about one million square feet and preserving the existing office building. The Coliseum itself would be demolished. Officials say construction will begin in late 1994.

 December 1993 -- Dinkins administration gives Mr. Zuckerman a 90-day deadline to close on the deal or to forfeit a $33.8 million line of credit. The deadline is later extended to April.

 April 1994 -- Giuliani administration presses the M.T.A. -- and offers it $50 million -- to revise its deal with Boston Properties to allow Mr. Zuckerman to build a smaller project at a much lower price.

 June 1994 -- Mr. Zuckerman and the M.T.A. agree on a new deal in which he would pay $80 million for half the original site. Mr. Zuckerman agrees to put up a $17 million nonrefundable deposit.

 Yesteday -- The deal collapses and the M.T.A. says it will seek an interim tenant.

HEADLINE: CRIME

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
Every cop in Los Angeles dreams of a second career as a movie star. The ones who do their 20 years in New York all want to be novelists. I'll go for that -- so long as they write with Ed Dee's drop-dead style and authenticity.
"Mob grief was our specialty," brags Anthony Ryan, who works for the Organized Crime Control Bureau in Mr. Dee's punchy first novel, 14 PECK SLIP (Warner, $19.95). Ryan and his hot-dog partner, Joe Gregory, are staking out the Fulton Fish Market one filthy winter night in 1982 when they spot a barrel going into the East River. Recognizing a mob burial when they see one, they call for the boys in the wet suits. The divers bring up the wrong barrel but an interesting barrel just the same, because it holds the remains of Jinx Mulgrew, a bent cop who disappeared in 1972 before he could spill his guts about police corruption to the Knapp Commission. Ryan and Gregory jump all over this case, which spooks Jinx's crooked pals on the force as much as his old mob associates. 
 Mr. Dee has been off the job for a decade, but he still has the eyes, the ears and especially the nose of a cop. You can see one character's fear in his jumpy movement, hear another's anger in his dirty talk. But you can smell the moral decay of the whole city in those "empty hours" between bar closings and dawn, when the funky streets belong to "the psychotic, the depressed, the guilty" -- and the cops who are supposed to clean it all up.
Reading isn't good enough for Nicolas Free ling's provocative crime novels. You also have to contend with the prickly ideas that give them their intellectual itch.
In his 32d meditation on a mystery, YOU WHO KNOW (Mysterious Press/Warner, $18.95), the author challenges his sophisticated French detective, Henri Castang, to determine whether a man who is incapable of love deserves to live. This stern metaphysical question comes up when Castang, who has been posted to the European Community in Brussels, is given the opportunity to solve the murder of a beloved friend and colleague. Although the dead man was only an obscure functionary, his Irish background and unpredictable ways suggest a secret connection to the I.R.A.
Castang's circuitous route takes him to Ireland and on a tour of the northern Alps in the company of a female field agent who co-opts the "technical, intellectual, deductive approach" to their investigation. Thus liberated to pursue a more instinctive and emotional path, Castang is able to look past disturbing evidence that his friend might have been mixed up with a cunning gang of art smugglers and flesh peddlers, and to explore the "powerful sexual possessiveness" that really got him in trouble.
In depth of characterization, command of language and breadth of thought, Mr. Freeling has few peers when it comes to the international policier.
Angel's Head is the summer place that we all dream about in winter. Crooked in the elbow of Cape Cod, the island shimmers in the bay like the lost Atlantis of a golden youth. To Mark Emmons, a native son who returns in John Smolens's ANGEL'S HEAD (Foul Play/Countryman, $19) after living in the Midwest, "the perfection of the island increased in direct proportion to the imperfection of his life."
Having established the allure of Angel's Head in hypnotic prose that flows in slow, languid currents, Mr. Smolens dashes cold water on his hero's homecoming. The woman Emmons still loves is married and miserable, and the real estate developer he once drove out of town has come back with a new scheme to build a bridge to the mainland. After the first of two murder victims is found ("gutted like a haddock"), plunging the island's fragile tourist economy into crisis, that bridge starts looking pretty good.
Mr. Smolens does not write of these matters in the methodical genre manner. The nonsequential story line is confusing, and too many characters come and go like migratory sea birds, littering the beaches of the plot with red herrings. But when he describes the sights that sting his eyes -- something as majestic as a storm at sea or as homely as a fisherman's catch of "junkfish" -- the author claims his element and speaks in his true voice.
"I'm what you call a high-on-pragmatism, low-on-ethics kind of guy," says Victor Plotz, the gregarious narrator of Stephen Dobyns's SARATOGA BACKTALK (Norton, $19.95), which is what you call a high-on-fun, low-on-fuss kind of mystery. Victor made his mark on previous books in Mr. Dobyns's Saratoga Springs series as the pushy sidekick of the private eye Charlie Bradshaw. But with that contemplative hero tied up on jury duty, it falls to Victor to investigate the complaint of a rich horse owner that his young wife and her lover are out to murder him.
Before Victor can do his stuff, the client is trampled to death by his wife's favorite show horse, a brute named Triclops whom someone has programmed to go berserk at the sight of a rat. There are plenty of those at the horse farm, including toothy human specimens among the owner's ingrate heirs. "I never saw such a place for excitable people," Victor says after the umpteenth fistfight breaks out at the stables. "No wonder it was called Battlefield Farms."
Victor stirs up more trouble than he resolves with his blunt methods of detection. But his snappy sense of humor gets this brash sleuth through his first case in high style. Mr. Dobyns, a poet and novelist of considerable subtlety, is no less artful at the delicate craft of the classic whodunit.
Marshal Salvatore Guarnaccia, the diffident hero of Magdalen Nabb's civilized procedurals, would rather do the cooking for the young carabinieri under his command at the Pitti Palace Station in Florence than work on a case involving expatriate intellectuals. In THE MARSHAL AT THE VILLA TORRINI (HarperCollins, $20), the chief of police longs for the confident wit of "an officer, an educated man," to figure out how a feckless Englishman could have drowned his wife, a respected author, in her bath and not leave a single clue.
After browbeating himself for his inability to focus his mind, think logically and interrogate cultured foreigners without being intimidated by their haughty airs, the good marshal solves this cruel murder the way he solves all his cases -- intuitively. "Though often accused of not following what people were saying," Ms. Nabb notes, "he was always aware of what they were thinking."
Ms. Nabb, an Englishwoman, writes with sweet, sober affection for the Italian city where she has lived for 20 years, and she turns an amused but compassionate eye to the eccentricities of Italians and outsiders alike. Among these finely drawn characters, the marshal seems destined to endure. The man's decency is as naturally refreshing as the tramontana, the wind that blows down the mountains to absolve a lovely, wicked city of its sins.

HEADLINE: Gambling Nation

BYLINE: By Gerri Hirshey; Gerri Hirshey is a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
We are the boat people. That is casino workers' slang for the millions of Americans now arriving at their portals in smelly diesel waves. We come by bus -- "motorcoach," if you want to get la-di-da about it. Tonight we have been plucked from rainy parking lots all over the Houston area, and we have clambered aboard prepared: pillows, shawls, lucky trolls, full thermoses, white bread, thick stacks of Saran-Wrapped luncheon meat. We're toting worn cotton slot gloves. Intensive Care hand lotion. Insulin. Tylenol. Cash. Doritos.
"We all here? Pedal to the metal, John. Let's git!" 
 We are Jeanne's Bingo Buddies of Houston, driving all Friday night in a storm that has already spawned killer tornadoes. We're headed east, into the teeth of it; had prayers before we reached the Interstate. Voices in the dark add a gamblers' homily:
"Gonna leave our worries back in Texas, and our money in Mississippi!"
"Hallelujah."
Out east on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, strung over 30 miles from Bay St. Louis to Gulfport and Biloxi, beckons a row of floating "dockside" gaming palaces, voted in in the early 90's by Harrison and Hancock counties, some up and running within five months. These are casinos so new that construction workers must weave through gamblers, so busy that some of these $25 million to $50 million investments can pay for themselves in a matter of months.
They'll be waiting for us there in the yawning bus bays, counting heads, papering us with discount coupons. We are low rollers. Slot hogs. And we are part of the great, teeming, itchy-fingered masses that have made legal gambling -- now known as "casino entertainment" -- America's new national pastime.
Gambling is now bigger than baseball, more powerful than a platoon of Schwarzeneggers, Spielbergs, Madonnas and Oprahs. More Americans went to casinos than to major league ballparks in 1993. Ninety-two million visits! Legal gambling revenues reached $30 billion, which is more than the combined take for movies, books, recorded music and park and arcade attractions. Thirty-seven states have lotteries; 23 have sanctioned casinos. More than 60 Indian tribes have gaming compacts with 19 states. As this century turns, it's expected that virtually all Americans will live within a four-hour drive of a casino.
"Okay, Buddies, sing it out!"
There is a bingo spirit in the air
Cause Jeanne's Bingo Buddies go everywhere
We sit together so that we can share
We're gonna WIN WIN WIN!"
Rolling toward the Louisiana state line in a big German-made bus, we are the new Gambling Nation, a yammering, munching, snoring aggregate of Italian-, Polish-, German- and African-Americans, 10th-generation Texans, Latinos -- and one Comanche. Most of us work; some are retired. Between us we dabble in bingo, the ponies, the dogs, the lottery, keno, cards and the slots. We'd like to win but we sure don't count on it. And if we do hit, our expectations are modest. "Three cherries and you take the family to Red Lobster instead of ever-lovin' Roy Rogers," a gent in a string tie explained to me recently in Las Vegas. "Hell, why not?"
And so we stand in lottery lines and climb aboard buses on the strength of possibilities. They're limitless, but with absurdist odds. America has come to count heavily on our cheerful folly. Our modest stakes have become the last best hope for budget-strapped state legislatures, for long-impoverished Indian tribes now permitted to run gaming ventures, for stockbrokers and investment bankers looking to salve the wounds inflicted by 80's excesses. To these grateful constituencies, gambling is no longer a sin, but a saving grace. It can vanquish the ugly specter of raising taxes and shake cash into shambling infrastructures, Head Start programs, fire brigades, tribal medical clinics. It can fatten portfolios with new high-performance issues.
On the strength of such boons, Mammon's had a makeover. Much has been made of the new PG Las Vegas, of the theme park hotels, the troops of Dorothys and Totos, buccaneers, knights and hunks in mini-togas who now cavort where made guys and hookers once ruled. Had any of us Buddies brought children along to Biloxi, we could have deposited them in the cheery child-care facility at the Grand Casino.
It's O.K. now, say the attitudinal seismologists. According to a national survey conducted by Harrah's, a top-tier casino company, 51 percent of American adults believe "casino entertainment" is "acceptable for anyone." Another 35 percent say it is "acceptable for others, but not for me." Even "gambling," the term that once conjured up green visors, cigar smoke and gumball-size pinky rings, has been buffed with warm fuzzies. We call it gaming these days. So Aspen. So Hyannisport. So very . . . sportif.
Why now? Exactly 100 years ago, Congress banned all state lotteries after a huge corruption scandal in Louisiana. But for the last decade, states couldn't vote them in fast enough or push them harder. The turnabout has to do with exigency, marketing and a mother lode of skepticism afflicting the national mood.
The vision of postwar prosperity that inspired Las Vegas's early gaming entrepreneurs in the late 40's has been inverted in the 90's. Possibility -- the cornerstone of this upstart democracy -- has rarely been so circumscribed, as the children of baby boomers find themselves competing for low-level "McJobs" and huge companies toss buyouts at once-valued senior staffers. Certainty has eroded, too, as pension plans go bankrupt and one underinsured double bypass can compromise the futures of two or three generations. With fewer and fewer "sure things," the timing is just right for a large-scale flirtation with Lady Luck.
It made all the difference that state and city governments have been her most enthusiastic procurers. Pious and public earmarks for state lottery money -- education! senior citizen programs! -- helped fade the taint of sin. Further sanitation was provided by the new corporate gleam of casino ownership. As I heard it explained most succinctly in the check-in line of an Atlantic City hotel: "Honey, it's not Don Corleone anymore. It's just Donald Trump."
Industry types like to remind you that gambling has long been the American way. After all, the first Continental Congress helped finance the Revolution with lotteries. Benjamin Franklin, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson each sponsored private lotteries. Our founding fathers were just numbers guys in wigs.
In "Temples of Chance," his penetrating study of gambling's transformation, David Johnston outlines boom and bust cycles in American history. One telling example: Vicksburg, Miss., now supports four riverboat casinos, with four more planned; back in 1835, local citizens, enraged by the proliferation of riverboat cardsharps and gambling dens there, smashed gambling equipment and hanged five professional cheats.
The current gambling boom is unlike any other for its size and for its mainstream status. The big winners are not outlaws, but publicly traded corporations and state and Federal coffers. Never has government been such a devoted bookmaker, taking in $25 billion a year on lotteries. The amount Americans spent on all forms of legal wagering last year -- $330 billion -- has set historical precedent of its own. Never has so great a fortune been staked on an itch.
 
SLOTS AND THE SUPPLY SIDE
'I just want to see that million-dollar ladies room at the Biloxi Grand," says Maggie Smith, a Buddy. "Everybody comes back talking about that john."
"Honey, those commodes are red porcelain."
The Buddies tell me that folks take flash cameras into the third-floor ladies' room at the Grand Casino Biloxi, which features a hand-painted Gibson girl on each stall door and gilt carts laden with gratis cologne, lotions and jumbo cans of Final Net. There are snowy linen towels to help with slot sludge, the shiny grime that blackens hands after 20 minutes of play. Indelicate acoustics are softened by a soundtrack of chirping birds. It's all part of what industry literature calls "feeling casino excitement."
"Some of my hard-core bingo people won't go near casinos," says our leader, Jeanne (pronounced Jeannie) Stewart. "But the ones that come to Mississippi or Las Vegas with us look at it as a mini-vacation. They gawk as much as they gamble, go walking on the beach. Look, I work in a hospital. Of a weekend, I love to see something that's not cinder block."
For more than a decade, Jeanne, a cardiologist's assistant, and her husband, Homer, a former golf pro, have regularly ferried some 500 Houston-area Buddies to the huge, high-stakes Indian bingo halls in Texas, Oklahoma, even as far away as a Cherokee operation in North Carolina, a trip that takes 17 hours each way.
The Stewarts know all about what investment bankers term "the pent-up consumer demand" to gamble. That mighty urge tops the demand side of an exhaustive report on the gambling industry by Smith Barney Shearson. The report's supply-side forces include the states' need for additional nontax revenue sources, the domino effect when states vote gambling in to prevent an income drain to adjacent gaming states and "high return on investment," at least initially, for new casinos.
The final supply factor is the proliferation of Indian gaming, which took in approximately $15.2 billion in 1992. Foxwoods, the Mashantucket Pequot casino in Ledyard, Conn., is currently the world's largest casino, hauling in more than $600 million in a year. Indian gaming is expected to grow by $500 million a year.
On the demand side, that "pent up" urge to gamble is measured partly by the estimates of illegal gaming. Gaming & Wagering Business magazine, in its most recent survey, figured the aggregate illegal take for horses and sports betting books, cards and numbers to be $43 billion. Also listed in that column: "attitude changes."

THE NEW SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE
Outside Port Arthur, Tex., we're still awake and chatty. Everyone is tired from the week's work -- as nurses, administrative assistants, apartment house managers. But all are merry.
"Gonna win!" yells Malcolm Peterson, punching his bed pillow. He is the silver-haired, 52-year-old son of Sara Peterson, an elegant, witty, retired businesswoman who describes herself as "only 80." For the last half-century, Malcolm has needed his mother's 24-hour care owing to multiple Down syndrome-related disabilities. They both love the bingo trips and the casino slots. As he will prove with great glee later this morning, Malcolm always wins at the slots.
"You wait," he tells me. "I'll help you win too." Once we pass his favorite part of the drive -- the refinery lights of Baytown -- he curls up to nap and reaches back for a reassuring pat from his mother.
"I'm here, Malcolm. Rest now."
She lights a cigarette and leans back, looking very, very tired.
"I'm in the stress reduction business," Jeanne Stewart says. After years working in cardiac units, she can read your blood pressure in your eyes. "I see what they look like when they climb on this bus Friday night. Gray. Tense and pinched."
In workday America, the life of the soul can stagger between exhaustion and escape, with little time for reflection. For many two-career families, single parents and career-driven singles, amusements tend to be compact. Weekend trips. Movies. Fast meals out. Leisure can take on the character of the work it seeks to counterweight. And it is no accident that as jobs creating durable goods give way to the service sector, as work places become more isolationist -- setting us in computer stations, telemarketing carrels, home offices -- entertainment itself has become less communal, more remote.
Last year, for the first time, the solitary pursuits of video games outsold movie admissions. Even teen-age bacchanals have been tempered by technology. For most concertgoers of Madonna's "Girlie Show" tour, the Main Dish was just a series of dots on a stadium video screen. This summer's Woodstock II concert is expected to generate $20 million in pay-per-view revenues from couch potato communards.
How, then, can anyone profess surprise at the casinos' staggering numbers? They're one of the few ways left to experience Saturday night live, to get out amid squealing, yee-hawing humans determined to raise a wee tad o' heck.
Call it the Beyond Bugsy Effect. When he built the Flamingo Hotel and casino in 1946, Bugsy Siegel envisioned Las Vegas as an oasis for his kind of people -- the restless grifters who couldn't toe that 9-to-5 line. What Bugsy underestimated was that little urge to slip the traces -- if only for the duration of a bingo game, a hand of 21 -- laying nascent in so many of us clock punchers, homemakers and retirees.
The new casino doges understand. They pack Harvard M.B.A.'s, not heat, provide baby sitters instead of hookers. Of the scores of gamblers I talked to, few voiced resentment at their genial casino hosts. Their greatest contempt was reserved for their elected representatives. Government, they pointed out, is unsurpassed at fostering the great illusion that you can change your life with one bet. Nowhere, particularly in the hyperslick ads that show blue-collar winners cavorting on lavish estates, is it intimated that the state lotteries offer worse sucker odds than any casino or honest bookie. The house edge for slots runs from 10 to 15 percent; the lottery 50 percent.
Over the last year, news magazine stories and television specials have decried this headlong rush toward fool's gold. Thundered Walter Cronkite on a cable special, "Legal Gambling -- The Dice Are Loaded": "All this while a nation once built on a work ethic embraces the belief that it's possible to get something for nothing."
Uncle Walter's stentorian moralizing makes very legitimate points about the "hidden" costs of gaming. There are plenty of grisly true stories about grannies gambling away pension checks. But ride the buses down here, haunt the Atlantic City bus lounges, the Texas bingo halls, and the majority of seniors will tell you they're spending more time than money. Time is cheap, time is plentiful, and in "golden" America, time can be a dubious kind of wealth. Elder testimony gathered at casinos reads like a wry, cranky litany:
"I cannot tie on those darn Reeboks my kids gave me and mallwalk one more time. I spend more that way than at the casino."
"I talk to people on these trips. When I stay home, it's just me and Oprah."
 
BOOM TOWN IN BILOXI
The sun is just rising as the Buddies pull into Biloxi. Klieg lights and welding torches flicker through the morning fog on the Mississippi Sound. This is boom town, a construction wildcatter's dream. They build around the clock here -- three shifts a day. Ten casinos were operating by mid-May, with another 11 proposed or under construction.
The "architecture" affixed to these floating barges ranges from faux paddle wheeler to mandarin palace. From the front porch of Beauvoir, the stately, white-pillared home that was the final residence of Jefferson Davis, you can see Treasure Bay, a mammoth castle-and-pirate ship. A Brobdingnagian mermaid holds up its prow, parting the gentle Gulf breezes with naked breasts as big as kettle drums.
All night, buses have been hissing to the front of Biloxi's Casino Magic, disgorging groups from Mobile, Jackson, Atlanta. And all night, perky hosts have been leaping aboard, stacks of plastic Casino Magic players' cards in hand. Before the sleepy masses can rouse themselves, they are filling out applications for the cards, which are inserted into the slot machines as you play, much like bank cards.
"Just tell us about yourselves. Birthdays, favorite colors, anniversaries. We want to know you better!"
Lively players, tracked by computer, can win incentives: free drinks, meals, even cash. The Buddies scribble away. Duly tagged and processed, we are released into the scarlet and fuchsia wild.
"Good luck, y'all!"
Seen at the 50's-style diner in the Biloxi Grand on a Saturday night: 60-ish parents with their young married children. When the food arrives, hands are joined, and heads bow in prayer. Spoon poised, the patriarch addresses his grown daughter:
"Now baby girl, them dollar slots is the devil. You stick to quarters, hear?"
Baby tucks into her hot fudge sundae with a right hand blackened from dropping those quarters. Nobody minds.
"I'm winning. Can't wash off that luck."
Mississippi is the nation's best petri dish for studying the effects of no-limits casino fever. And no place is there a better example of the ease with which old-time politicking has gussied up a fundamentalist's sin and elevated it to savior. This Bible Belt state has some of the nation's poorest counties, run-down agricultural areas like Tunica, dubbed "America's Ethiopia" by Jesse Jackson. By the late 80's, bankruptcies were more insidious than any boll weevil plague of yore. The tax base was on life support. The palliative? Gaming.
When it voted to legalize gambling on the waters of the Mississippi River and the Mississippi Sound several years ago, the revenue-hungry state legislature set no limits on the number of dockside casinos. And, unlike expensive and stringently regulated Atlantic City, which also has no license limits, Mississippi has a cost of doing business that is low enough to entice all comers. This has resulted in five major "gaming markets" -- Tunica, Vicksburg, Natchez, Greenville and the coast. A total of 54 casinos could be operational within the year. Louisiana is mounting a challenge with boats and casinos. Next year, Harrah's expects to open the world's largest hotel casino in New Orleans -- just an hour's drive from Gulfport.
The Mississippi charge was led by State Senator Tommy Gollott, a powerful, well-connected Biloxian who has long been an advocate of nearly every kind of gaming. The casino push started in the mid-80's, Gollott says, when a former state senator, Sandy Steckler ("a cousin of mine"), came to him for a little help. One of Steckler's law clients was a gambling cruise ship, the Europa Star. Its owners needed legislation to allow it to operate off the coast.
Gollott was happy to help. "We were having a terrible time," he says. "And I saw a lot of my friends going down, all types of businesses."
Gaming looked good. "I wanted to bring additional revenues into the state without adding taxes on people," recalls Gollott, whose logic is still echoed by embattled legislators across the country. He was single-minded in his pursuit. "I introduced the lottery a number of times," he says. "Horse racing. Jai alai. . . ."
Finally, Gollott looked to have a winner with dockside. But the vote seemed too close for comfort. In March 1990, on the eve of the crucial cruise ship vote, there was a strange exodus from the Statehouse.
"You oughta have seen those ol' boys run," recalls Mayor Glenn Mitchell, of Long Beach, Miss., describing the night when eight state senators from very conservative areas disappeared and missed the balloting.
Mitchell had driven up to Jackson, the state capital, to lobby against the casinos. (The small town of Long Beach is the lone holdout on the coast, having consistently voted against allowing casinos there.) "I caught up with one of them on his way out," Mitchell remembers. "He's from a real Bible Belt area and voting for gambling would be the end of him. Well, he just waved at me, wouldn't even roll down his car window."
Gollott, who was accused of getting the conservative senators to skip the vote by calling in heavy political favors, counters: "I don't remember asking anyone to leave."
Mitchell says: "We lost by one vote. I think it's incredible cowardice, bad politics to betray your constituency that way." Gollott insists it was just business as usual in a Statehouse where folks from unaffected counties stay out of the business of others."
There was a to-do, however, when it was revealed that Gollott's family business owned a 4.2-acre waterfront property at Biloxi's Point Cadet, bought in 1987. Gollott did not disclose his personal interest until after the Senate dockside vote. In March 1992, one month after Gollot's county voted to allow dockside gambling, his company entered into an agreement to lease the land to the Biloxi Casino Corporation for $1.9 million over the first five years, and another $47 million in options over the following 85 years.
Now Gollott chuckles and says its darn tough to argue with success -- the community's and his own. "Gaming has changed this coast," he says. "We have 47,000 people working for the casino industry. Unemployment before dockside was 8.7 percent. Now it's less than 5."
He admits there are glitches. With traffic hellacious and accidents on the rise, legislators are floating more bond issues, pumping up feeder roads. And he hopes they can figure out how to help neighboring nongaming counties strained by the influx of casino workers' children overburdening their school systems.
Overall, though, Gollott says, "All the changes is positive." He predicts his low sandy Gulf Coast will rival Las Vegas in another decade. "I see a lot of high rises in east Biloxi, D'Iberville, all along the interstate." Query him about overdevelopment, and Gollott says, "I believe the weak will fall by the wayside. The strong will survive."

THE BUFFET LINES COMETH
Dinnertime if Gulfport, at Le Teagarden restaurant, a French-Vietnamese establishment on the main beach road that has become Casino Row. Hung Vu Nguyen, the owner and chef, has cooked only eight meals. With some time on his hands, Henry, as he prefers to be known, is listening with polite amusement to my stuttered hosannas over his astonishing catfish. In Manhattan or Los Angeles, his suave multi-cult alchemy would have foodies offering their firstborns for a reservation.
Since the casinos opened, Henry Nguyen has seen his staff dwindle from 45 to just a handful -- mostly family members. "I can't compete with the wage-and-benefit packages the casinos have," he says. Business, once S.R.O., has been flatter than a Gulf flounder. Even regular customers come monthly rather than weekly. Casinos, they tell him. They all have restaurants, all-you-can-eat buffet lines. Plus games, shows, shops, nurseries, full-service A.T.M.'s. . .
"They build it so you never have to leave."
Henry Nguyen says that he is a philosophical, if weary, man. He survived wartime missions as a pilot in the South Vietnamese Air Force, has raised three children here and would just like to get them through college. "I am not bitter," he says. "I just want to hang on."
At some local residents' insistence, I also drop by to see "Miss Annie" Lutz, a restaurant owner of legend whose roots go as deep as those of the biggest live oaks here. Miss Annie has been serving up tender flounder and tough opinions since her parents opened their restaurant in 1929. "Been through recessions, been through Hurricane Camille back in '69," says Miss Annie. "Got by O.K. Not so sure about this one."
Annie's is "off the highway." Customers never had trouble finding her -- until now. "Felt it right away," she says of the casino competition. "Don't let any of us locals tell you we're not hurtin' ."
Atlantic City was the first gambling mecca to find that not all segments of the local economy are served by casino growth. Since the first casino hotels opened there in 1978, 100 of the city's 250 restaurants closed. Retail business dropped by one third. Tourism there has begun to dip as well. As nearby areas like Philadelphia and the New Jersey Meadowlands consider gaming, Atlantic City is making noise about "reinventing" itself as a tourist destination and convention town. After 16 years of legalized gambling, this "city" -- with no golf course, no supermarket and no movie house -- is realizing the price of piling all its chips on one number.
Such is the difference between what financial analysts call the "euphoria" and "reality" phases of the gaming cycle. And it's easy to understand why they don't welcome realists in Mississippi just now. Even in casino-free Long Beach, Mayor Mitchell has been granting audiences to hotel and condo developers. "Times have changed," he says, "since I darn near stood on my head to get the K Mart into town."
Hotel operators on the coast are definitely euphoric. There are not nearly enough existing rooms to accommodate the estimated 50,000 casino visitors a day. Thus, weekends here are sheer madness. The Buddies and I had to put up at a Waffle Inn, plunked in some woods off the interstate, nearly an hour away from the action.
But downtown, little has changed. Walk down 13th Street in Gulfport and count 10 empty storefronts. There is one thriving new business in a converted A.&P.: Casino Jewelry and Pawn. On the beach in Biloxi, there are four new pawnshops, each stocked with wedding and engagement rings left behind by gamblers, some on their honeymoons.
Local crime statistics are not easy to come by. Last year the Gulf Coast towns had 16 bank robberies, a fourfold increase over the year before. Law enforcement officials have reported small rises in drug arrests and prostitution in and around the boats.
The Biloxi Salvation Army is struggling to keep up with a tripled caseload of singles and families -- casino Okies -- who migrated here to find jobs and were shut out. Five chapters of Gamblers Anonymous have opened where there had been none. The suicide rate has inexplicably doubled in Harrison County, though no health care official was willing to tie the increase to gambling. "There is a lot of stress and a lot of change," ventures Gini Fellows, director of recovery resources at Gulf Oaks Hospital. "And people don't take to change very well."
The day I visited Mayor Mitchell, a copy of the day's Sun Herald lay folded on his neat desk. The headline blared: Big Stink Hounds Casinos. In March of this year, every casino in Biloxi was found to be violating sewage discharge laws. Illegal grease and oil dumping were clogging lines and creating noxious fumes.
But elsewhere things are still coming up aces. Employment figures have hit record highs. And there are Sun Herald headlines that read, "Biloxi Now Among Few in Black." As I left Mayor Mitchell, I ceded my chair to a smiling amusement park developer from New Orleans wearing an endangered species tie.
"Pretty country out here," he ventured. "Don'tcha think?"

GONE WITH THE WIND?
"Well cuss those tree-huggin', Bible-thumpin', Gamblers Anonymous, investigative, naysayin' no accounts."
My tablemate at the Pirate's Cove in tiny Pass Christian, Miss., is waving a catfish po'boy the size of a bowling pin.
"Rich N'awlins summerhouse layabouts. They don't need casino jobs."
The gentleman, who prefers to remain unnamed, says he is making $14 an hour raking dice at a Gulfport craps table, which beats the tar out of his old wages at a video rental store. I have made the mistake of describing my boat cruise with a couple of pesky women who drive around with "no casino" stickers on their station wagons.
"Agitatin' liberal fools!"
At town meetings and E.P.A. hearings, a coalition of local residents is lobbying to limit casino development, particularly in the wetlands near their waterfront homes on the Bay of St. Louis, west of Gulfport. Lib Duffy and Nonnie DeBardeleben admit they're "not real popular" in many circles here, where folks can do some creative cussing.
With Lib Duffy's husband John at the helm, we push off in a small motorboat to look at proposed casino sites around the bay. Despite repeated offers from a developer working with the casinos, John has refused to sell their property. When the last offer was spurned, the developer, a high-school classmate, offered some neighborly advice:
"Sell out now or you're gonna walk out Sunday morning and find Bubba passed out in his pickup, right on your front yard."
Lib Duffy was not intimidated. "I was raised here," she says. I can handle my Bubbas."
Corporate Bubbas are something else. Ally them with councilmen swooning over their new tax numbers, Duffy says, and the odds seem hopeless sometimes. Yet she vows she will not be forced out by the noise, development and traffic of 10 additional casinos proposed for this lovely, quiet bay. (Two are already operating.) She hopes her neighbors will also stand firm. Environmental issues do concern people here, according to a recent poll published in The Sun Herald. While 61 percent of local residents think the casinos' economic effects are positive, 84 percent believe more state regulation is needed to protect wetlands, the region's greatest natural asset.
The fiercest battles are being waged over development in the delicate bays, like this one, and the larger Back Bay of Biloxi, where shrimp and fish spawn in the salt marshes. Noise, dredging, heated water flushed from air conditioners, trash and sewage overload are all serious concerns in these prime nursery areas.
"We were able to rebuild when Camille destroyed our home," says DeBardeleben. "But if they muck this up, there's no going back."
At the helm, John Duffy eases the boat up to the broad, windowless back of Casino Magic. The barge settled on the bay bottom not long ago, and divers had to refloat it. Nonetheless, there are plans to add a restaurant barge and an R.V. park. "These bay locations are desirable," says DeBardeleben, "because they're more protected from hurricanes."
Hurricane safety is an issue that all these spindle-masted and pagoda-roofed "vessels" must contend with. But there have been no satisfactory answers. "Nobody wants to ruffle the casino men," says DeBardeleben.
Evacuation of 50,000 daily visitors over narrow coast roads and five bridges is a worrisome prospect. The question of moving or securing the floating casinos is still causing controversy. For more than a year, most casinos have been operating with insurance that requires evacuating the behemoths to safe harbor during storms. This month, Gov. Kirk Fordice announced that the barges would have to stay put and owners would have to build or retro-fit moorings to withstand 155-mile-per-hour winds and 15-foot tidal surges. As hurricane season approaches, casinos and insurers are vociferously opposing the plan.
Louis Skrmetta, a local excursion boat owner, has doubts that the new gaming palaces can withstand serious gales. "Some claim they can withstand any huge, ocean-going storm, he says. "During Camille, freighters built to ride storms out at sea were thrown so far up on the beach they had to be cut up for scrap."
Lib Duffy says someone made a joke at a meeting the other night. "They said maybe only God can stop corporate America," she says. "Maybe we need a hurricane."
That thought returns on a blustery evening as I head out of the Asian-themed Lady Luck Casino in Biloxi. In the valet parking area, what looks like a nubby concrete wall has been sideswiped by passing cars. Idly, I stick a finger in one large dent. Foam pellets -- the kind used to fill beanbag chairs -- pour out over my shoes and blow away in the wind.

THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT
The riverboat os preposterous!" Steve Wynn is saying. "When you build a riverboat, you build a gambling hall. A gambling joint appeals to that small percentage of the public that wants to gamble. If we're looking at a cross-section of the earth, that's the equivalent of topsoil in the earth's crust."
Wynn, Las Vegas's acknowledged Wizard of Wow, is speaking from the epicenter of the Gambling Nation, his $770 million Mirage Hotel. We are talking in the outdoor garden surrounding his elegant, glass-walled bunker on the hotel's ground floor.
"Riverboats seem to be something you can sell to the voters," Wynn mutters. All those floating delta ventures, the Iowa paddle-wheelers are just so much shifting silt to Wynn. He wouldn't touch them with a barge pole. Nor would he reconsider Atlantic City, where he sold his cash-minting Golden Nugget casino hotel in 1987 -- for $440 million, then a record. As a showman, he felt hamstrung by uptight Eastern regulations -- no signs, no lights, no fun. He'll never go back. After years of casino gambling, he says, it's still a slum-by-the-sea.
Wynn flings an arm out toward the mountains. "When you talk about a destination resort like Las Vegas, you're talking about a cut that goes down deep into the igneous rock," he says. "We build places for folks who don't think of themselves as gamblers."
Steve Wynn has made a bedrock business out of helping folks maintain that deception. Much of his psychology he learned from Benny Binion, who ran the Horseshoe Casino here. "Always give a gambler a good excuse," Binion advised Wynn back in the 60's. "They'll appreciate your doing that."
At the Mirage, 20,000-plus visitors a day show their gratitude by spending more than $700,000 on nongambling pursuits. The gawk-and-gamble crowd keeps Wynn's 1,500-seat showroom sold out twice a night, six nights a week, 40 weeks a year -- at $73 a ticket. They keep his 3,000-room hotel at more than 95 percent capacity, and often sold out. (The national average is 65 percent.) They bring cash for Wynn's casino, and camcorders for his white tigers, his dolphins, his $32-million man-made volcano out front.
The attitudinal sea change toward "casino entertainment" owes much to Wynn's well-executed excesses here. Nobody does it better -- and with cannier timing. While Jay Sarno's Circus Circus can be credited with offering the first free "themed" entertainment in the mid-70's, with trapeze artists and clowns cavorting over the casino area, it was Wynn's far grander vision that jump-started the Vegas transformation. Listen to Wynn explain the simple lines of what he calls his "better mousetrap":
"The name of the game here is who gets the walk-in," Wynn is saying. "Your brain says you're in the harsh, inhospitable desert of southern Nevada." How to bend that? Casting about for a theme, he seized on a beloved American musical. Wynn says he was thinking about the director Joshua Logan's first shot of Bali Ha'i during the film version of "South Pacific." "Juanita Hall as Bloody Mary is singing, they've got the filters on. Orange. Amber. . . .
"I said to my buddies: look, you'll see 150,000 gallons a minute of the most beautiful, lush, tropical thing we can do. Shrouded in trees, with a boulevard going up to it. And you'll say this is funky! Could the inside be as fanciful as the outside?"
He claps his hands.
"That's the roll of the front. That's the hook."
Wynn is all but yelling his corporate mantra: "We've got to keep the promise!"
They walk into an atrium that smells like Bali Ha'i. Flown in from Hawaii: live orchids, elephant ears, banana trees and coconut palms, intermingled with top-of-the-line silk facsimiles.
"We're gonna chevron the casino around the atrium. . . . When they come out, they'll already be in the middle of the casino."
Gotcha.
In its first month of operation, December 1989, the Mirage beat Caesar's 1988 Atlantic City gaming revenue record of $38 million, taking in $40 million. The Mirage's unprecedented success led to other multimillion-dollar hallucinations, like the MGM-Grand with its yellow-brick road, the Egyptian-themed Luxor with a tour-boat-laden Nile River in its lobby and Wynn's own pirate-themed Treasure Island. It also led to that Miss Kitty ladies' room at the Biloxi Grand. And you can't tell me that Vegas va-va-va-voom didn't infuse the lagoons and atriums of Minnesota's stupefying Mall of America. Vegas has even spun off a PG, homogenized version of itself in the dewey bosom of Branson, Mo.
Steve Wynn and the Branson bunch, from Loretta Lynn to Tony Orlando, know why management will never take down that Elvis memorial in the lobby at the Las Vegas Hilton: we are all members of the Lost Tribe of Elvis, wandering here to his neon desert in record droves. Over the last decade, we have made Entertainment -- the Big E -- our No. 2 export, behind jet airplanes. We watch E! network, display an alarming capacity for receiving our news with a rimshot. From "A Current Affair" to the grits 'n' Jesus "gospel brunch," we will be entertained. Product has taken a back seat to Production Values. So build it big, build it outrageous and we will come. Some of us may be summoned to worship, others to hoot. But everybody pays the cover charge.
"This place was a no-brainer," Wynn says. "It was like spitting and hitting the sidewalk." This, he says, is because of the big E factor so many people discount when sizing up his town, where gambling and entertainment achieved that crucial meld.
"In my view, Las Vegas has been an entertainment attraction since the 50's," Wynn says. "Gambling was what you did while you were here. But the shows, the characters! The attraction has always been the mystique of the town, the Sinatras. You come to see the lights. You can stay up all night."
Lord knows they come dressed to play. Earlier I stood at the bottom of an escalator next door at Wynn's Treasure Island hotel and counted 14 adults in a row descending in bright nylon jogging suits and fanny packs. From Biloxi to Bettendorf, Iowa, the fanny pack is the official badge of the Gambling Nation, riding high above cholesterol-belted radials, or weighted low by three rolls of quarters.
You see more silk shirts and the occasional Rolex in the more upscale Mirage. High-roller table games -- blackjack, roulette, craps and baccarat -- rake in 30 percent of the Mirage gambling revenues. By way of example, Wynn plops yesterday's profit-and-loss statement beneath my nose; the gaming take is more than $3.6 million, skewed upward, he says, by just one high roller.
"An Asian gentleman," is all he will say. "Playing baccarat. He won $1.5 million then gave it all back -- $7 million -- last night."
For years, all the big casinos have staffed sales reps specializing in the huge Asian market here and abroad. When I visited Las Vegas on Chinese New Year, every room was sold out within 10 miles of town. To better service his biggest fish, or "whales," as high rollers are known, Wynn already has offices in Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Kyoto, Hong Kong and Jakarta.
As American-style gambling goes global, Wynn won't have any difficulty financing overseas expeditions. His current line of credit, somewhere over half a billion dollars, is provided by 17 domestic and foreign banks, including Bank of America, Bankers Trust, Societe Generale of France, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Even a decade ago, such an all-star lineup would have been unthinkable for a casino stock.
The road to respectability and boundless credit lines started when a couple of young turks in denim -- Wynn and Michael Milken -- took a casual meeting in August 1976. Wynn was 36, and struggling to finance a second Golden Nugget casino, this time in Atlantic City. Milken was 30, an ambitious bond trader for Drexel Burnham Lambert. Wynn blue-skied the Victorian candy box he wanted to build, top rung, going straight for the customers who still order their steaks bloody and their Lincoln Town Cars once a year. Milken was intrigued. Though Drexel had refused financial requests from other gaming companies, Milken had a new vision of the bond market that was built around risk.
Junk bonds, all but unsecured, high-yield issues, would become the financial communtity's hottest 80's gamble. Milken and his traders would grow impossibly rich on Americans' willingness to finance a long shot at high interest rates with huge built-in bonuses (the Trifecta!), should these companies actually pay off their debt on time. For Milken's raiders, it was indeed morning in America. And the casino industry was happy to stay open 24 hours to service those millions in new debt.
With Milken's intercession, Wynn got a $20 million debt issue for the Golden Nugget Inc., then worth only $35 million. It would set the stage for quarter-billion-dollar forays into the junk market by other emerging gaming outfits like Elsinore (Hyatt's gaming branch), Trump, Hilton, Circus Circus and Merv Griffin's Resorts International.
"In '87, when we started the Mirage," Wynn recalls, "I phoned in 525." Meaning he raised $525 million easily, quickly and at "attractive" rates. "The gaming industry had an instant love affair with the bond market, primarily because Michael Milken made the commitment," he says. "He vouched, they listened, then the gaming industry kept the promise."
In the mid-80's, he says, he could scarcely believe his own good fortune: "You could sell gaming to these major companies and sell their debt for any amount of money. You never saw half a billion show up as fast as it did for this place, and it wasn't guaranteed by the parent company. All I did was guarantee to finish the building."

'WE'RE IN THE POLITICAL BUSINESS NOW.'
If there was any resistance left to gaming as an acceptable divertissement, it wasn't in the state capitals. The industry could now count government among its most forceful allies. Wynn thinks attitudes were tenderized by all the pounding from those television lotto ads -- served up by Madison Avenue's best -- on government contracts. You gotta be in it to win it. Hey, you never know.
"The states pummel citizens with the benefits of the easy dollar in gaming, which is not the right thing to say, because it's not that way," Wynn says. "But the states did it."
For years, he had to answer to hectoring gaming commissions. Now when Steve Wynn talks, government listens. After word leaked that the Clinton White House was considering a 4 percent gambling tax to finance welfare reform, Wynn called Representative Dan Rostenkowski at home, at 11 P.M., to register his deep displeasure. Recently, during a drive through Philadelphia with that city's mayor, Ed Rendell, Wynn told hizzoner that the riverboat gambling being proposed for the Delaware River there was a "cockeyed, ridiculous idea." He told him that nothing would fill his new half-billion-dollar convention center like committed hotels downtown.
"If the Mayor could announce that anyone who builds 1,500 rooms can have a gaming facility inside, and if he had an agenda where that neighborhood near Market Street was to be developed, my prediction is that in Philadelphia, it might take 60 days to get three of us there. We might cut loose a billion. A billion two. . . ."
Soon, pending approval, Wynn will be constructing another one of his lavish, tender traps in Vancouver. He's also preparing a joint venture on South Beach in Miami, anticipating a casino referendum in Florida. And he's headed for the Lone Star State, with the hearty encouragement of Houston's Mayor, Bob Lanier. In April, Lanier, in the company of Gov. Ann Richards, opened the new Sam Houston Race Park, declaring "There's a lot of tax revenue out here."
The race track was built by Maxxam Inc., which will be Wynn's partner in a new venture there. When I visited Houston, a Maxxam executive drove me through the proposed casino site, a weedy, not-so-sprawling urban park that currently holds the dilapidated Sam Houston Coliseum and an exhibition hall. The whole sorry package is wrapped in freeway ramps, and set at the edge of a very moribund downtown. Wynn is unfazed by the mess, and by the fact that casino gambling must still go up for a vote next year. With Mississippi and Louisiana casinos sucking Texas wagers over the border, it's expected that the vaunted domino effect will carry the day.
Meanwhile, the Maxxam-Mirage consortium will construct an "interim park," with "grass berms, graceful walks" and a performance stage as a "gift" to the citizens of Houston. And they will assume the $5 million cost of demolishing the old buildings and removing asbestos. Should gaming be passed, Maxxam-Mirage will guarantee rents and taxes of $15 million a year for the city coffers.
"Bob Lanier's got this really nice project of ours," Wynn says. "We'll get licensed all right."
Wynn says gambling's estimable new position in America is making him reassess his own. "This spread of gaming, the complexity of new jurisdictions and the issues raised are going to put a new requirement upon fellas and ladies like myself. A requirement to be very circumspect. To learn how to think dialectically, on a number of levels besides just operational."
It's come a long way from cost-per-servings and high-roller comps.
"We're in the political business now."

EVERYONE INTO THE PIT
Leon Gilliam designated Party Animal, is working his cheering constituency in front of the Big Six wheel in Harrah's "Party Pit." It's his afternoon shift. Peer in from the blinding sun out on the Vegas Strip this 87-degree day, and rockin' Leon is one exotic vision, a tall, model-handsome black man with many moving parts and a very long ponytail currently whipping time to that polyester chestnut, "Y.M.C.A." For some reason, the Village People are tops in the Pit.
Gilliam deejays, sings, dances, deals and takes bets on the wheel -- all with boundless energy and wit. Stationed right inside Harrah's front door, directly across from the entrance to the Mirage, he and his T-shirted fellow Pit vamps constitutes Harrah's latest weapon in what's called "capture" -- enticing bettors in off the street. Harrah's, considered by many market analysts to be the best-run, most solid casino company in the game, is putting friendly faces up against Wynn's volcano. They don't go for kaboom -- just consistency. The hook used by the Party Animals is straightforward enough: Let's boogie.
Bunches of helium balloons mark the Pit -- six blackjack tables where party dudes and dudettes deal, joke, whack careless bettors with rubber hammers, ring bells and joust with collapsible plastic swords. Poker faces have no place here. And on Saturday nights, the wait is five deep for a seat.
"Call me a dealer-slash-entertainer," Gilliam says, mopping his brow during a break. "Cause that's the job description these days."
Though Gilliam has a couple of "jammin' " octogenarians among his devoted fans, most of the Pit patrons seem to be in their 20's and 30's, women in cutoffs and halter tops, men whooping and high-fiving over the payoff on a sweet pair of queens. Revenues for this area of the casino are up more than 50 percent since employees dreamed up the Pit last year. The "capture" has increased from 35 to 52 percent of passers-by. And now the fun is being franchised at other Harrah's casinos. That's entertainment. And it's good business. In 1992, the stock of Harrah's parent, Promus, Inc., soared 150 percent.
Brand-name entertainment is Harrah's stock in trade, thanks in large part to its 4.5-million-player data base (users of Harrah's gold cards) that lets management fine-tune its customer "relationships." Beginning in the mid-80's, Harrah's was the first to use the plastic cards, which have the same sort of magnetic strip used to identify customers on credit cards. In the casino war room, a "hot screen" flashes the names and locations of customers playing here on their birthdays, along with their favorite drinks.
Out on Harrah's casino floor, "celebration stations" produce the beverage, balloons, a cake. When someone hits big on a slot machine, "win committees" converge like cheery commandos, toting a boom box that plays Kool and the Gang's "Celebration." Glittery "lucky dust" is sprinkled over the area -- a salt lick to draw slot hogs foraging for a hot machine.

'CALL ME ODELL'
Here in the non-smoking, quarter-slot section at Harrah's, the gentleman to my right has just been personally greeted ("Hello, Odell!") by a small message screen on the "Fourth of July" slot machine. His gold card is attached by key ring to a gaudy clutch of others from Caesars, the Mirage, Bally's, Grand, the Hilton, Casino Magic. . . . "Just call me Odell," he says, confiding that he's playing hooky from his mechanic's job in Milwaukee.
"All these places," Odell says, "they know my grandbabies' names. They know I drink Wild Turkey straight up, Sprite when I'm serious. They know when I took my lovin' bride -- in May of '58. Gave us champagne on our anniversary. They know how much I've lost on what machines and to the penny."
"I like these people," Odell says of Harrah's, as a waitress delivers another free bourbon. "They treat me right. And I can't say that of my phone company, my bank. Hell, I don't expect them to let me win. But they bust butt to make sure you have a good time."
Harrah's aims for the heartland, not the whales. It has cut way down on high-roller events and incentives and has even installed a McDonald's in some of their casinos. As the truly corporate casino, Harrah's is state of the art.
The facade of Promus's Memphis headquarters is an upscale version of the Southern decorators' chintzed roost in "Designing Women." The mansion, exquisitely appointed with mahogany sideboards, Persian rugs and priceless Chinoiserie sits on five acres, heady with enough azalea and magnolia to fell Rhett Butler. Inside a tasteful modern cube behind the mansion, the Big Brain hums. Harrah's data base, a property as valued as its formidable real estate, is tended by scores of market researchers, product developers, direct-mail geniuses and cost managers.
The president and chief executive, Phil Satre, has his office in the Big House, a clubby, paneled room with many photographs, including one of Bill Harrah, who started the chain as a Reno bingo parlor in 1937. Leaving the high rollers to others, says Satre, "has been a philosopy from Day 1 -- Bill Harrah was the first to emphasize slot machines versus table games." His slot logic now prevails throughout the industry. Satre recalls a certain snootiness when the slot-heavy Harrah's Marina first opened in Atlantic City. The East Coast was supposedly high on table games. Within three years, Harrah's was the most profitable casino in town, with slots representing 70 percent of the revenues.
"Most casinos are getting on the slot bandwagon," Satre says. "They recognize that it's the most stable customer base. They're not trying to win real big. It's people who are there for fun. They'll be back if they have fun."
He likens the lure of slots to that of fishing or golf. "I'm convinced that golfers only need one good putt in 18 holes," he says. "People are willing to have intermittent reinforcement of what they want to have happen. And if there's enough, it'll keep them excited about it."
This is one reason that Harrah's decided to help slot winners celebrate their triumph over the house. Hollering and boom boxes make images of the Big Payoff flash in a hundred nearby brainpans. So does the sound of money. One selling point of a Bally Pro Slot machine, claims an ad, is "a noisy stainless steel tray, so that payoffs are truly exciting."
Harrah's is more upfront than most gaming companies on the issue of gambling addiction. The Harrah's casinos I visited had large posters advising "Know When to Stop," with a hot-line number, 1-800-GAMBLER, that is partly financed by the company. (Other casinos post the number, some in small stickers on slot machines. At Trump Castle in Atlantic City, I found it in tiny type in the same folder with the room service menu.)
At Harrah's, a special employee-training program helps spot customers losing control. Estimates on the percentage of the American population at risk for the problem vary between 1 and 4 percent. With 46 million households visiting casinos annually, management has labeled it a significant corporate concern.

'IT'S GETTING KINDA UGLY
Tugging at the bill of his Tomball Cougars cap, Buddy Bates is addressing the nagging question of the S.P. -- saturation point -- "the thing politicians don't want to talk about." When will the big machine read "tilt?"
Bates, publisher of the Bingo Banner News, has cast his lot with what the industry trades call a "mature" form of gaming. Houston bingo looked fat and happy a couple of years back, but now he's wondering if it's going to get his son through college.
"Lucky the boy's a fine baseball player," he says. "Probably get a scholarship."
In the vast roiling sea that is now legalized gambling, Bates says he's no killer whale, like Steve Wynn. He's just a modest bottom fisher, putting out his free newspaper, with ads and schedules for Houston's dozens of bingo halls. He's making a decent living off people's need to know when and where they can gamble.
Texas is a big bingo state, and until recently, there was plenty of action for everyone. Voters approved it as the first form of legal gambling in 1981. A decade later, they were spending $1.5 billion a year on bingo -- but then it leveled off. High-stakes Indian halls started yanking them over to El Paso and across the state line to Oklahoma. Last year, the state government dealt local operators the greatest blow. "As soon as the lottery started, we felt it -- bad," says Bates. "Now Louisiana has casino bingo. Hall operators all up and down the pike tell me attendance is way down. And now you've got the race track open. Steve Wynn wants to put that casino downtown. Good night."
Bates made the tough decision to accept ads from the track and from the tour operators running buses to the Choctaw, Chickasaw and Otoe Indian halls, to the Gulf Coast boats and casinos. Some outraged local bingo operators pulled their ads.
"Everyone's snapping at one another," he says. "Lowering card costs to where it hardly pays, just to get them in there. Moose, Eagles, V.F.W.'s, the little charity guys, they're hurting bad. It's getting kinda ugly."
I saw this for myself the night I dropped into the Golden Nugget bingo hall in southwest Houston to play an evening session. The crowd was sparse for a Thursday night, according to the bookkeeper, Jackie Madeley, and they were dying at the snack bar. Nobody was spending.
"I can't even sell a full box of pull tabs anymore," grumped Madeley. She was talking about the instant bingo games sold in the hall -- pull up the cardboard tabs and see if you've won instant cash. Pull tabs are gamblers' popcorn, so addictive, Madeley says, she used to sell two boxes of 2,300 tabs a night.
"The pull tab money," she says, "goes to the lottery now. They've got us in some kind of vicious cycle."

FROM BINGO LADIES TO BOOKIES-IN-A-BOX
What's happening in Buddy Bates and Jackie Madeley's little pond is an apt microcosm for the tensions afflicting some other gaming markets across the country. Struggling horse tracks are agitating to install slot and video poker machines to hold the railbirds firm. Already riverboats are weighing anchor and trolling new waters. Even conservative states like Iowa are considering easing gambling limits imposed on their cash barges. Donald Trump is bawling "no fair" over his Indian competition. Investment banking houses issue monthly reports projecting increasing competition. And more and more state legislatures are jumping into an already crowded field, introducing gambling bills to help dying mill towns, crumbling cities, stricken farm areas.
Given the nature of this huge, runaway industry -- that it's built on an ancient but mercurial urge -- no one is willing to predict whether and when the gambling boom will level off or crap out spectacularly. Many smaller outfits are operating on dangerously slim margins, throwing what Phil Satre of Promus calls "stupid money" at dense-packed casino areas like the Mississippi Coast. Satre likens this investment influx to the boom that created the hotel glut in the 70's. "It's like any industry that gets hot, like the athletic apparel industry," he says. "Financial institutions get swept up in it and make some bad judgments."
Nonetheless, the big wheel keeps on turning. The cable industry, perhaps in an effort to finance its interactive ventures, is aggressively investigating pay-television gambling on "gaming channels." The goal: a "bookie-in-a-box" atop every television. Slide some popcorn into the microwave and your Visa card into the slot atop your cable box. Punch in your wager for the Knicks-Bulls game and sit back. No more meeting Big Louie at the Blarney Stone steam table -- the check or the corporate debit will be in the mail.
There is evidence that this gambling pandemic is going global. England is about to have its first lottery since 1826, something that has the racing and football touts up in arms. It's also experiencing a tremendous bingo boom; Sloane Street debs and street kids in nose rings and Mohawks are invading the bingo halls there. Moscow is now honeycombed with busy casinos. And Lebanese gamblers are literally risking their lives to patronize West Beirut gaming houses that draw equal fire from militiamen and religious fundamentalists. Big winners are escorted home by casino guards armed with machine guns.
Air space -- domestic and international -- is the final frontier. Harrah's, working in tandem with a company called Sky Ventures, is angling to put video gambling equipment on commercial flights. After all, bored passengers are already swiping credit cards through their seat backs to make phone calls and catalogue purchases. Virgin Atlantic Airways is weighing plans for in-flight casino-type games, so the race is on. John Boushy, Harrah's marketing vice president, says, "It wouldn't surprise me if somebody has something in the air by early '95."
Buddy Bates says he's trying a high-tech tack, too. He has installed a gaming news fax service -- just dial up the Moose Hall bingo schedule -- but the fax phone rarely rings. He has a sidelight -- bingo fortune cookies -- though he allows "that's a spotty sort of a thing." So he's moving his operation out of two tiny rooms in this northwest Houston office building back home to suburban Tomball.
"Hedging my bets," he says, smiling. "And counting on those hard-core folks who're gonna bingo no matter what. They're bedrock. Those bingo ladies started it all."

YOU SEE IT ALL OUT HERE
I'm reding about the demise of Spanish Raymond as I ride my very last bus, the morning Casino Express from Memphis south to Tunica. The New York papers have chronicled the investigation and arrest of Raymond Marquez, the most successful and legendary numbers king the city has ever known. Spanish Raymond ruled for more than 30 years, taking in an estimated $30 million a year from the barrio poor. No one could touch him. So how did Raymond get caught? After years of building an empire on tiny scraps of paper, he tried to go high-tech. The police intercepted fax transmissions from his office manager to Raymond and his wife at their motel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.. Like the new casino moguls, Raymond liked his profit-and-loss statement with his morning cafe con leche.
Raymond isn't the only old-time oddsmaker feeling the pinch these days. "Too much heat now" was the reason several veteran bookies wouldn't talk to me for this article, even with promised anonymity. I can remember when newspaper sports departments had to eject these guys regularly, shooing them out like so many flapping, cackling crows. Now they are hard to flush out. Though illegal gambling still pulls in billions, the guys in those flashy sport coats have opted to blend in with the working stiffs.
It's not as if they're out of Continued on page 61
business. Sports betting, one of the most common, casual and evergreen forms of gambling, is still the most prohibited. Consider the official opprobrium that rained on Pete Rose, or the huffy editorials decrying Michael Jordan's golf wagers. No effort has been spared by league offices to preserve at least the illusion of sanctity on the gridiron and diamond. A 1992 Federal law banned sports betting in any state where it wasn't already legal, and since New Jersey was unable to pass a pro-betting bill before a December 1993 deadline, that left only Nevada for a legal bet on the N.F.L. playoffs -- and a lot of busy bookies everywhere.
I'm still thinking about Raymond, arrested in his light blue bathrobe, when I spot the turn off Highway 61 to Commerce Landing, the cluster of casinos closest to Memphis. Rising up out of cotton fields that have been flooded to create placid dockside lagoons off the less stable Mississippi, the Tunica casinos look much the same as their coastal sisters. Pirate ships, Wild West towns and Harrah's ersatz Tara.
At 9 A.M. on a weekday morning, Harrah's Tunica operation is quiet: a few holdouts from last night, lots of seniors and a noticeable contingent of wheelchair patrons. In fact, throughout my casino days and nights, I've never seen such a public concentration of the American disabled. At Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, I saw a wheelchair patron with his forehead strapped to a board support, and an IV bag swinging overhead. I saw a quadriplegic woman playing the slots by hitting the "spin reels" button with a device held in her teeth.
You do see it all out here in the Gambling Nation, people of different races, incomes, playing skills and ages having a swell time rump to rump. By and large, people are friendlier than they are at airports, bars, even some churches I've been to. It is startling how many life stories tumble out in between spinning reels. If you make your living questioning people, the forthrightness is astounding.
This may sound a lot like the up-with-people, rainbow vision of the Gambling Nation that Phil Satre described in a speech to the National Press Club last spring. It's what you see in a lot of the gaming companies' glossy annual reports -- clutches of well-dressed, ebony-and-ivory casino patrons photographed in mutual ecstasy over a brimming bucket of coins. It's what I heard from Steve Wynn, delivering an Emma Lazarus-like description of his customers: "The inhibited, the introverted, the noisy, the quiet, the aggressive, the meek! They all find something here."
That vision is also, in many places I visited, quite true. People who wouldn't make eye contact in a mall or gas station do commiserate over a balky Lucky Seven reel. Bouncing along Highway 61, listening to the easy conversation between strangers -- a black mother and son and a couple of elderly white "Driving Miss Daisy" types across the aisle -- thinking about Jeanne Stewart and her mixed bag of Buddies, I have to concede that gambling's clientele has changed as much as its image. For the most part, and at least while they're playing, the new gamblers are a pleasant, noncombative counterweight to the "ordinary people" who fume and scream at one another from those pit-bull audiences on the afternoon talk shows.
Is it genuine tolerance, or a marketing conceit? Is it a spurious neighborliness, or are partisan-weary Americans simply longing for a gaudy, giddy cease-fire zone?
Standing amid the relentless din, the pinging and the haloo-ing, counting the deflated fanny packs, the full Snugli's, the acres of rapt newlyweds, homemakers, pipe fitters, dentists, paraplegics and granddads, I have to wonder: how'd we get here? As American fair play dissolves, as the gap between rich and poor widens and the middle class gets squeezed from both sides, are we just pushing our chips toward that primal equalizer -- chance?
I think part of the answer may lie in a conversation I overheard in Tunica between two women sporting identical bouffants. One was tsk-tsking cattily at the spandex exuberance of a well-endowed patron. The other reproved her, firmly but smilingly:
"Sister, we all stand naked before the Odds."

Preserving a Heritage Of Victorian Homes

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: STAMFORD

 BODY:
THE old adage that one person can make a difference is exemplified in Renee Kahn, a Stamford artist, teacher, wife and mother whose low-key persistence for the last 20 years has preserved much of Stamford's Victorian architecture.
Noted for the integrity and common sense that she brings to preservation, she cares most about being able to turn significant old mansions and rowhouses into handsome units for low- and middle-income people. 
 "When I started, the profile of a preservationist was elitist," she said. "That's how I'm different. Wealthy individuals can buy and restore antique homes themselves, but just because somebody is poor doesn't mean he or she has to live in something ugly or minimal, or can't appreciate a historic house with a pretty porch to sit on.
"There was an implicit classism and racism in the 70's that said only the sophisticated upper classes can enjoy historic houses. The rest of you take what you get and be happy with it -- basic housing with no vermin and nothing leaking. That burned me up!"
Working in Bridgeport, Norwalk, Norwich and Danbury as well as Stamford, she has lost count of the number of projects, planning and consulting jobs and demolition hearings that she has been involved in, but she says "it's into the hundreds." To keep the public informed of current preservation issues she edits a monthly newsletter for her nonprofit Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program, and her book, "Porches," published by Henry Holt in 1990, is in its second printing.
When urban renewal began in the late 60's she had just moved to Stamford from Manhattan with her husband, Samuel, a lawyer, and their three children. Then, as now, she taught art history and subjects related to art and architecture at the Stamford branch of the University of Connecticut.
"Up to that time nobody had paid any attention to Victorian wooden houses -- preservationists were still hung up on the Revolutionary War," she said. "Today, half of Stamford's 700 19th-century buildings would have been saved under modern preservation standards. But in order to get rid of substandard housing the more that was wiped out the more that could be offered to a developer who would come in and rebuild the city. It was a devastating blow to take away such a huge chunk all at once."
AT that time the only sympathetic ear she had at City Hall was Nancy Mitchell Hadley's. "I met Renee in 1974," Ms. Hadley said, "when I was Stamford's community development director." She is now the Connecticut Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. "It was a time when New York was going belly up and developers were overruning Stamford," she said. "The pressure was terrible to tear everything down and build new. When Renee appeared, it was like a gift."
Ms. Hadley was the administrator of $2 million in annual community development block grants from the Federal Government, some of it for loans to rehabilitate historic structures as low-income housing. "Renee trained my staff in preservation," she said, "reviewed architectural plans, met with community people. She was our secret weapon when someone had to be convinced to restore rather than destroy an old building.
In the 80's building boom, things got worse. "Something had to be done to prevent the West Side, South End and Waterside from being demolished," Ms. Kahn said. "Everything was viewed as a plot on which to build, and they did. We conducted a survey of 2,200 houses in 1978. By 1988, 25 percent were gone, and downtown it was closer to 75 percent."
With the help of Ric Redniss of the planning firm of Parsons, Bromfield, Redniss & Mead, Ms. Kahn wrote city legislation that curtails destruction and is regarded as a valuable preservation tool. "It gives developers willing to restore buildings rather than destroy them additional units, and permits traditional side yard, setback, and parking regulations to be set aside," Mr. Redniss said. "It's very hard to argue against it."
The Kahn-Redniss effort on historic density zoning was adopted by the city in 1984 and amended in 1993 to include industrial as well as residential buildings. It was enhanced in 1985 by Stamford's demolition-delay ordinance, which mandates a 90-day waiting period after a demolition permit has been issued.
IN that period, negotiations with the owner may save the building by using the density bonus, or someone may file legal objections to demolition, or preservationists may photograph the building and remove significant architectural details when demolition is inevitable.
Using the bonus legislation, Michael A. Pavia bought the 1855 Hatch-Keeler mansion on Richmond Hill Avenue in 1987, moved the house to the front of the 28,000-square-foot property, restored it, and was able to rent it as a mixed-use building, combining residential, retail and office tenants. On the rest of the property he was allowed to build five small residential buildings, winding up with a total of 18 apartments plus the commercial space, instead of the 14 apartments that were permitted under conventional zoning.
"Thanks to Renee our building is in a more prominent location and serves as a neighborhood landmark and anchor," said Mr. Pavia, who was then a developer and is now the city's Commissioner of Public Works.
The Community Development Office still supplies loans for low-income historic housing rehabilitation from Federal block grants. Rents in the restored buildings are based on half the median income, which in the Stamford area is $73,600.
"A family of four earning up to $40,000 a year qualifies," said Timothy R. Beeble, community development director. Landlords borrow $15,000 a unit at zero interest and there are no mortgage payments for 15 years, at which time they may pay the principle and sell the buildings or rent at market rates. Or they may renew the mortgage on the same terms, provided that they continue to rent to low-income tenants.
Ms. Kahn is a restoration consultant under a contract with the Community Development Office. "She is one of a few preservation consultants recognized by the Connecticut Historical Commission," Mr. Beeble said. She was appointed to its board by Gov. Ella T. Grasso and served for several years.
One of her current projects is 97-99 Atlantic Street, where the owner, Alfred Sanseverino, agreed to restore the entire building to its appearance in an 1890 photograph. "It will cost around $200,000," Mr. Sanseverino said, "$18,000 just for the storefront! I could do it in aluminum for $3,500, but I will get five apartments out of it instead of three. I'm a Stamford native and I want to make Renee and the city happy."

HEADLINE: For a Troubled Building, a New Twist

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
DONALD J. TRUMP likes to boast that Trump Palace on Third Avenue is a fast-moving condominium. This is not a distinction he seeks for his next project, Trump International Tower and Hotel
Trump International Tower is what most New Yorkers know today as the old Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle. They also know that the 579-foot skyscraper twists perceptibly in high winds. 
 Such movement will simply not do for an apartment house and hotel, which is what the 24-year-old building is to become after Paramount Communications (the successor to Gulf and Western) moves out. Its lease expires next April. As part of the two-year, $230 million reconstruction, trusses and columns are to be added to make the tower more rigid.
Too small to satisfy the demands of commercial tenants, the building's 13,000-square-foot floors strongly suggested the conversion, as did the panoramic views it would afford. "The floor plate of the building is ideally suited for residential," said Bruce L. Warwick, executive vice president of the Galbreath Company, a real estate concern associated in this project with Mr. Trump and with an affiliate of the General Electric Pension Trust, which owns the building.
From the outside, the contrast between old and new will be dramatic. Under plans by Philip Johnson, the zebra-like black-and-silver facade will be replaced by a dazzling, beveled, multifaceted skin. The columns and horizontal spandrels are to be reclad in Champagne-colored mirrored glass. The windows, tinted a light bronze, will form three-sided bays among the angular columns.
"Philip thinks it's the best building he's ever done," Mr. Trump said the other day, lightheartedly, before double-checking with the architect whether the quote fairly represented Mr. Johnson's opinion.
"I'll allow you to use it," Mr. Johnson told Mr. Trump. Then he turned to a reporter and added, "But give him credit for saying it."
New Yorkers can be counted on to form strong opinions of their own about this design, particularly since the 45-story building commands such a vital site, gateway both to Central Park and the Upper West Side.
In some ways, however, the key is not what is added to the facade but what is added underneath. The tower must be made more stable. Motion that might merely discomfit an office worker would be intolerable for a resident, particularly one who had paid, say, $900,000 for a one-bedroom apartment.
"Our largest concern was that issue," Mr. Warwick said. "When the building was built, the degree of sophistication about high-rise structures was nowhere near what it is today. It's basically a safe building but the allowance for sway was much greater. In a heavy wind condition, it was not unsafe -- but it was uncomfortable."
The job of making the tower more rigid falls mainly to Ysrael A. Seinuk, the 62-year-old chief executive officer of the Cantor/ Seinuk Group, a 100-person engineering concern in Manhattan.
He first worked with Mr. Johnson in 1957 on a hotel project in Havana that was never built. Some of the firm's notable recent jobs includes a research building for the Rockefeller University that spans the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and 450 Lexington Avenue, a tower that rises through an old post office from a base in the subsurface rail yards of Grand Central Terminal.
"There is nothing wrong about the building," Mr. Seinuk said about the Gulf and Western tower. "The engineers designed it according to code as it was then. There is nothing over-stressed about it. I'd live in the building today with no worry." He would, however, see the chandeliers swing a bit from time to time and hear the walls creaking as the structure shifted.
"It moves about two-and-a-half feet, very quickly, at the top," Mr. Seinuk said. "If it was just swaying two-and-a-half feet slowly, people would not feel it. The problem is that it twists. And that acceleration is what people feel and what makes them uncomfortable."
WHY are other tall buildings in New York not plagued with such a troublesome reputation? Because, Mr. Seinuk said, they are usually clustered with other high-rise towers in mid-Manhattan or downtown. The Gulf and Western Building, by contrast, stands in isolation.
"Most other buildings built at that time are shielded," Mr. Seinuk said. "This building is totally exposed."
"Which," Mr. Trump jumped in to say, "is a great asset for views."
Heavy winds from the northwest run freely down Broadway, Mr. Seinuk said, but are partly blocked by tall buildings along Central Park West. As a result, the wind moves faster across the west side of the Gulf and Western tower than the east side. This turns the structure into a kind of airfoil, not unlike the wing of an airplane, creating vibrations.
Working under professional review by another engineering concern, Leslie E. Robertson Associates, Mr. Seinuk devised several methods to reduce the movement by more than half and control vibration.
In the hotel, running from the base to the 14th floor, diagonal steel truss members will be added behind the interior walls that ring the core of the building, making the center of the structure more rigid.
Because the 15th and 16th floors are used for mechanical equipment, much larger trusses can be built without concern that the diagonal elements will slice through a prime view or poke through a spacious living room.
At this level, two-story outrigger trusses will be built to tie the core of the building to the exterior frame. Also, a two-story belt truss will be run around the perimeter of the tower to discipline the response of the whole structure to wind forces.
From the tops of the inverted V's formed by this belt truss will emerge new columns, interspersed among the existing columns, reducing the column-to-column distance from 26 feet to 13 feet, further rigidifying the periphery of the building.
Given all of this effort and expense, one wonders why the developers did not simply raze the building and start over again.
"The reason we're leaving the steel is that we have a mass that would never, ever be allowed again," Mr. Trump said. With 610,000 square feet of floor space on a 34,000-square-foot lot, the floor-area ratio is about 18. Zoning rules would not permit a residential building with a ratio of more than 12.
"We would have to reduce the building by 10 to 12 stories," said Scott C. Coopchik, executive managing director of Galbreath.
Even with the larger building, however, the developers said they are bound by the lower residential density, meaning that only two-thirds of the tower can be set aside for apartments, of which there will be about 200.
The bottom of the building is to be the Trump International Hotel, with some 200 suites that will be sold as condominium units to investors. Under zoning rules, these must be used "primarily for transient occupancy and may be rented on a daily basis." Hotel services will also be available to permanent residents upstairs, Mr. Trump said.
"Value is added to Trump Tower apartments by having an atrium," Mr. Trump said. "Likewise, I think that great value will be added by having a hotel section."
Mr. Trump also said he was negotiating with restaurants like the Four Seasons, Bouley, Le Bernardin and Le Cirque to operate the dining area at the top of the building.
Besides a sky-high restaurant space, the tower comes with other built-in advantages. Because it was designed for office use, its floor slabs are 12 feet apart. That allows for finished ceilings 10 feet or higher, about a foot or two more than typical in a modern apartment building, including Trump Palace.
But the redevelopment team was also constrained by the shape of the box. Since it already exceeds current zoning rules, there was no room for the pediments or pinnacles or mansards or gables that Mr. Johnson has been known to employ. "You couldn't do any modern architectural whizbangs," he said.
For Trump International Tower, Mr. Johnson said the choice of material was virtually a foregone conclusion. "I'm a great glass man," he said. "We didn't want to load down the building with sheets of granite."
"We're distilling everything we've learned about glass over the years," he said.
Working with Mr. Johnson on the Columbus Circle project is Costas Kondylis. The two architects are also associated in the design of buildings for Mr. Trump's Riverside South project on the Hudson River.
TWO months ago, when speaking of the new facade for the Gulf and Western Building, Mr. Trump conjured images of the Seagram Building, on which Mr. Johnson worked with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
In the event, the design turned out to be much more like PPG Corporate Headquarters in Pittsburgh, which was completed in 1984 to designs by Mr. Johnson and John Burgee. Like the PPG building, Trump International Tower has a pleated facade, with angular columns and mirrored glass.
"By doing that," Mr. Johnson said, "we take the curse of the glass box away. We make it shimmer in the light."
Unlike the PPG building, the windows in Trump International Tower will not be reflective, since a mirrored surface cuts down on transparency and views will be strongest selling point of the new apartments.
At first, the design called for flat window expanses between the columns. Then, the architects designed a two-sided projecting bay. But they finally settled on a more traditional three-sided bay. "Everybody likes that," Mr. Johnson said. "You get a sense of having a promontory room."
On the matter of whether the projecting bays add floor area to the building, Mr. Johnson and his colleagues met Wednesday with Buildings Department officials. A spokesman, Vahe Tiryakian, said the buildings agency is reviewing the floor-area issue, and the reinforcement and recladding plans.
Other key issues yet to be resolved include redesigning the entrance to the Columbus Circle subway station at the southern end of the plaza on which the tower sits. The station is now reached through a dank, barren pit.
There is also a 532-seat subterranean movie theater, once called the Paramount and now Loews Columbus Circle. That will close next year but Mr. Trump said he was not ready to announce what would go in its place.
The redevelopment team is also exploring the project's eligibility for tax benefits. Mr. Trump said one possibility was the Section 421-a program, which offers abatements on residential construction. There is also the J-51 program, for residential conversions, and the Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program, which might apply to the hotel.
Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Democrat who represents the area, criticized the impending construction of "luxury apartments that we don't need more of," adding, "I only hope they're fully tax-paying, because we could use some of the revenues."
As to whether there are buyers, the answer is yes -- in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China -- said Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group. She is directing sales and marketing for Trump International Tower, with Louise Sunshine of the Sunshine Group.
Overseas purchasers who would not have considered the West Side a few years ago are now moving into the Lincoln Center area, Ms. Corcoran said. They have, for instance, bought many of the apartments in the Three Lincoln Center tower.
Trump International Tower "is not a West Side building per se," said Andrew Weiss, executive vice president of the Trump Organization. "This is a Central Park-Midtown building with incredible views."
APARTMENTS will range from about 900 to 4,000 square feet. Ms. Corcoran envisions Asian purchasers buying units for their own use or as long-term investments. "They spend quickly," she said. "They spend a lot. They love newness. And they're crazy about views."
It remains to be seen whether prices can reach as high as Mr. Trump would like. "There are larger units in condominiums selling already for $1,000 a square foot," Ms. Corcoran said. "But it's not the norm."
Some people who live in the neighborhood cannot imagine it will ever be the case. "I just don't think, in this market, that kind of thing is going to fly any more," said Madeleine Polayes, president of the Coalition for a Livable West Side, which fights what it sees as overdevelopment of the area.
Ms. Polayes dismissed this and other recent announcements by Mr. Trump -- obtaining financing for Riverside South, becoming a partner in the ownership of the Empire State Building -- as gambits to improve his standing in the eyes of current and prospective Asian investors. "He needs this to show the Hong Kong people how vibrant he is," she said. "It's all hype and P.R. No one is talking about his debts and lawsuits."
But Ms. Corcoran said Mr. Trump's involvement had a definite economic value.
"What was important in the name was that it had 'Trump' in it," she said. "I'd say that whether Donald was in the room or not." (As it happens, he was at the time.)
"When people come from out of town," she said, "we can show them a smaller product at a higher price if it has the Trump name. Customers are predisposed to paying more. The name says glamour."

HEADLINE: Using a Mortgage Broker

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
WORKING with a mortgage broker is something relatively new. It's only in the last seven years that they have become popular, largely because prospective borrowers seem too busy these days to shop for themselves and some prefer to let a more qualified person find the best rate and terms.
Mortgage brokers have also gained an excellent reputation for helping marginal borrowers who cannot negotiate a loan on their own. Moreover, they can help the novice borrower collect the necessary documents and fill out the forms. A good mortgage broker will even make a prior credit check and help the borrower clear up any problem areas before the credit record is seen by a lender. 
 Little wonder that about a half of all home loans now originate through a mortgage broker. Yet with only a scant history to fall back on, many people aren't even sure of the questions they should be asking before selecting a broker or how to recognize honesty from sleaze. But it can be done.
"We just went with our instincts," said Jerry Weist, an appraiser of antique comic books who with his wife, Dana Hawkes, recently bought a rowhouse in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. But relying on instinct alone is taking a big chance.
First, a definition. Mortgage brokers do not originate loans. Rather, they scour the marketplace for the best possible deal among a basketful of lenders with whom they deal on a regular basis.
They are paid by the lender -- not the borrower -- for bringing in a client. (Of course, the borrower still pays an application fee, typically no more than a bank would charge.)
Say, for instance, the lender has a published charge of 2 points on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for a borrower who walks through the door. When a mortgage broker makes a referral the points charge is split between broker and lender. On a no-points mortgage the lender will normally split part of the higher interest rate charged in lieu of points, based on a predetermined negotiated formula. So it should not cost a borrower more to use a mortgage broker than to go directly to a bank, another reason for their rising popularity.
But even this broad definition leaves a lot out. For example, some loans never go through a mortgage broker. These include certain state-sponsored mortgages offered with uncommonly low down payments or at discounted interest rates to moderate-income buyers.
"We aren't permitted to offer them," said Bernard J. Senderak, president of The Source Mortgage, a mortgage broker in Fairfield, Conn.
So even the best mortgage broker can never provide access to a truly comprehensive universe of lending. But the more reputable ones will explain how to apply directly when they are aware of a mortgage, unavailable through them, that might work better.
It is equally important to understand exactly how mortgage brokers negotiate their commissions with lenders, since these deals can lure even the most honest broker into temptation.
Thomas Hylinski, senior vice president at People's Bank of Bridgeport, Conn., said lenders generally negotiated separately with each broker. And some lenders cut highly favorable deals with certain brokers to encourage them to send the business their way, even though that lender might be charging more than the competition.
At other times, warned Vicky Papson, a mortgage consultant with Emigrant Mortgage Company of Darien, Conn., the broker may add a quarter point or so to the advertised interest rate whenever he or she thinks the borrower isn't going to find out.
"Never brag that you're too busy to check things out yourself," said Ms. Papson, who used to work as a mortgage broker, "or tell him you think you're going to have trouble getting any sort of loan."
Both are tip-offs that tempt the broker to incorporate excess charges, she said. And they can be difficult to detect even though regulations require all fees to be disclosed.
Instead, say these experts, suggest that you're closely following the latest promotions. Also, that you will question every one of the broker's recommendations.
Another protection is to call the institution where the broker intends to place the loan to make sure the rate is no higher than if you had applied directly.
Michael Hoogendyk, executive vice president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, warned against using a broker who demands an upfront fee before providing specifics on the total cost to the borrower for the loan and the terms of the loan.
And be thorough with the search. Say a real estate agent has recommended two brokers and your lawyer has offered yet another name. "Question each one carefully on the phone," said Alan Trachtman, president of National Money Merchants, mortgage brokers of Park Slope, Brooklyn. "Ask about their plans. Ask for a list of lenders they use."
During that interview, said Mr. Hylinski, the banker, the borrowers should seek references. They should ask for the names and phone numbers of two or three other borrowers who have recently used that broker and referrals to a couple of lenders the broker regularly uses.
Borrowers should also decide initially what they most want from a mortgage broker and base their questions on those needs, too.
For example, if they anticipate credit problems, can the broker guide them through a prior credit clearance and the complexities of the paperwork? If the borrowers are busy, can the broker return their calls on evenings and weekends and even make house calls?
Mr. Weist, for one, needed to work with someone who could rush the loan through so he would not overstep an imminent capital-gains deadline.
Others may prefer to work with a broker who may be willing to negootiate the fee. This is indeed a point worth raising, especially when seeking a jumbo loan (anything over $200,000) since the fee will be proportionately larger even though it may not require extra time to process.
For example, the broker may be willing to charge the borrower only 1.5 points instead of the normal 2, taking a half-point cut in his own commission. It's an excellent way to get an even better deal than going through a lender directly.
As the process moves forward, a broker should not be asking for a second application fee if the loan is rejected by one lender and another has to be approached, said Mr. Hoogendyk. Nor should a broker be promising, in advance, specific rates or terms, since these are dependent on the lender and change rapidly.
Finally, it is crucial to check the progress of the application. Mortgage brokers are sometimes criticized for not submitting paperwork in a timely fashion.
Delays may be prevented by calling in every week or so. "But don't wait a month before asking for a progress report," said Ms. Papson. "Two weeks is long enough."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New York Room Tax;
Surcharge End Delights Hotels

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT took New York's travel industry four years to get the state to repeal the hated 5 percent surcharge on hotel rooms renting for more than $100. It took New York City hotel managers probably four minutes to start marketing the fact that as of Sept. 1, that tax will be history -- and that three months later, the city will shave an additional percentage point off the tax as well.
"We're getting the message out that New York is visitor-friendly once again," said an ebullient Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, which rushed out a four-page newsletter celebrating the repeal. 
 Indeed, almost immediately after the state tax repeal was announced on June 8, the Convention and Visitors Bureau and the hotels issued news releases heralding the impending new "low" room tax of 13.25 percent plus $2. They put stickers highlighting the tax repeal on their old sales brochures, and designed new ones that stress the new tax. And they put every available salesperson on the phone to convention managers to spread the good news.
"We called every single person who ever cited the tax as a reason they would not hold a meeting in New York," said Jean M. Spaulding, director of sales and marketing for Sheraton's two New York hotels.
The repeal's timing couldn't have been better. Hotel sales people made it a major topic at the Travel Industry Association of America's convention in Miami last month, and will probably do so again at next month's meeting of the American Society of Association Executives in San Francisco.
The Marriott chain just held a long-scheduled three-day meeting in San Diego for 225 of its best corporate customers, and the Marriott Marquis decorated a booth with bogus newspapers making the repeal page one news. Genuine headlines abounded as well -- numerous trade magazines and journals put the repeal on their front pages.
Stephen J. Morello, head of the convention bureau, heard about the repeal while he was in Chicago, pitching New York to various meeting planners there.
"I announced it to a group of association representatives, and they gave me a standing ovation," Mr. Morello said.
But will the tax repeal actually bring tourists and conventions back to New York City?
It's too soon to tell for sure. Hotel statistics show that 40 percent of room nights are booked two years in advance. Conventions are booked at least three years in advance.
Moreover, all of the hoopla about the tax has tended to obscure the many other reasons that travelers and conventioneers might shun New York. Many complain of high food, parking and room costs, of filth, of fears about crime and of traffic congestion. They cite the Javits Convention Center's problematic 11th Avenue location and layout, and the continual battle with unions over work rules.
"A lot of people promised to put New York back into the rotation of cities they consider each year, but no one will give a guarantee," said Ms. Spaulding of Sheraton.
That does not surprise Jeffrey W. Wood, director of conference planning for the Direct Marketing Association. His group is headquartered in New York and has many members within driving distance of the city, yet even he is not planning to hold his annual conference in New York any time soon.
"The tax was never the only reason I went elsewhere," he said.
Nor is Fabian G. Palomino, the Javits Center's president, surprised by continued hesitancy. He concedes that his meeting rooms are small, and that the column spacing on exhibit floors is more conducive to trade shows than to conventions. He is seeking approval to double the center's size, and to offer inexpensive parking. And he is trying to persuade exhibitors and their contractors to take a firmer stance with the unions.
"I wouldn't agree to some of the overtime rates or crew sizes that they accept," he said.
NEW YORK'S boosters stress that competing cities have strikes against them, too. They note that Seattle is perceived as rainy, New Orleans as hot, Las Vegas as too glitzy.
"New York is not the destination for everyone, but neither is Lake of the Ozarks, Mo., and that's cheap," said John Kalinski, director of marketing for the Marriott Marquis.
Still, New York has a herculean marketing task to repair the damage that has been done since the 5 percent surcharge was imposed on June 1, 1990. That day, New York's combined city and state taxes on hotel rooms went to 19.25 percent plus $2 -- effectively, 21.25 percent on a $100 room, compared with a national average last year of 11.68 percent.
According to the American Economics Group, a research organization, last year New York City hotel guests paid an average $24.47 a night in taxes, calculated on an average hotel room rate of $116.75. The average nightly tax in Washington, Atlanta, Las Vegas and other cities that New York competes with for conventions came to only $8.06.
Only four other cities -- New Orleans, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington -- even hit double digit figures on average taxes. New Orleans, the second most heavily taxed major metropolitan area, came in at a paltry-by-comparison $12.02, less than half New York's rates.
Convention managers had reacted to the surcharge with fury. Indeed, the Professional Convention Management Association recommended to its members that they avoid New York City as long as the tax existed.
"Lots of people think of New York as terribly expensive to begin with," Mr. Morello said. "To them, the tax was the icing on a very distasteful cake."
It was also a psychological affront, said Arthur A. Surin, senior vice president of the New York Hilton. "Convention managers said it was against their philosophy to let themselves be fleeced, and that even if we lowered our base rate to compensate they would still feel taken advantage of," he said.
Even hotels with room rates below the $100 at which the tax kicked in hated the levy. "As the more expensive hotels lost convention business, they started going after our airline or tourist business with lower rates," said Kenneth I. Walles, general manager of the Hotel Pennsylvania, a mid-priced hotel.
Not surprisingly, the hotels and the convention bureau spent four years trying to drive the impact of the tax home to state legislators. The hotel association hired the American Economics Group to gather economically damning data that they could use to lobby Albany.
The group came up with a formidable list of fiscal hurts. It noted that hotel employment was down 15.2 percent from the pre-tax peak; that convention-related hotel business was down to about 1 million delegates, just two-thirds of the 1.5 million that came here in 1989; and that the number of conventions that are comprised primarily of out-of-town delegates was down precipitously as well, from 640 in 1990 to 405 last year.
Actually, the dire numbers probably overstated the case, in that the hotel tax hit New York at about the same time as did the recession. Employment, tourism, business travel and convention attendance traditionally drop during any economic downtown.
And no one knows for sure if the tax has affected the length of stay of people who do come to New York, or the number of times business travelers will bring spouses.
"You get a non-expense account family of four visiting, and the tax might mean they forgo a set of theater tickets, or shave a night off their stay," Mr. Surin said.
But the muddiness of the figures did not stop the hotel association from capitalizing on them. It organized a Repeal the Hotel Tax rally on March 15, 1993, at Madison Square Garden. And it organized a campaign that deluged state legislators with thousands of letters decrying the tax.
Now, the industry is mobilizing its internal publicity machine to capitalize on the repeal. Many hotels sent faxes and E-mail and memos marked "urgent" to their international sales and reservations offices, to help them sell New York as a reduced-in-price destination. The Marriott Marquis even sent out a video of its sales people toasting the repeal with champagne.
But there is one aspect of the tax cut that the industry is decidedly playing down: The 1 percent city tax that is disappearing was a so-called dedicated tax, used exclusively to finance the convention bureau. Hotel executives worry about that because many convention customers count on a strong bureau to arrange transportation, provide greeters at airports, and to smooth relations with the convention center and the hotels.
"I'm not publicizing the 1 percent repeal until I'm sure it doesn't kill the convention bureau's funding," Mr. Kalinski of the Marriott Marquis said.
Mr. Morello says that city officials have assured him that his budget will not be slashed drastically. But, he concedes, he will have to redouble efforts to "make sure that the city continues to recognize that its investment in us is getting a strong return."

HEADLINE: The New Britain-Wroclaw Connection

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
WHEN the Iron Curtain collapsed of its own weight in Europe in the late 1980's, no group rejoiced more than the Polish-Americans of New Britain.
For decades, New Britain's Poles -- the major ethnic group in the city for most of the century -- had been agonizing over the fate of relatives and friends in Poland. Now Poland would be free at last, free at last. 
 Jubilation over the breakup of the Soviet Union was quickly followed however by some sobering questions. What would the new freedom really mean to Poland? How could the country survive in an outside world of which it really knew little after half a century of virtual isolation?
 
Adjusting After Communism
 Leaders of the Polish community sought the advice of leaders of Central Connecticut State University, which had started a Polish studies program several years ago because of the city's large Polish population. Together, they decided that the best way, perhaps the only way, to really help the new Poland was to teach its people how a free-market economy works and how to adjust to it from a Communist system.
Some $25,000 in seed money to get the venture started was quickly raised by the local General Jozef Haller Post, Polish Army Veterans Association, supplemented soon after by a $50,000 grant from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
Thus was established what is known officially as the Institute for Business Studies at Central Connecticut State University, but which unofficially might be known as the New Britain-Wroclaw connection.
Over the past five years, in a quiet and generally unpublicized way, Connecticut business people and educators, more than 50 in all, have shuttled back and forth to the Technical University of Wroclaw in Poland. There they have explained the facets of a free-market economy to faculty members and city officials, remaining for periods ranging from about a week to full semesters. Unpaid volunteers have included Stanley A. Twardy Jr., formerly United States Attorney General for Connecticut and formerly chief of staff for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., and Sandra K. Hamer, president of a Farmington public relations firm.
In turn, educators from Wroclaw have visited Central Connecticut State to monitor classes, to talk about American business practices and to decide how best to make them work in a country that has marched to an entirely different drummer for half a century.
Exchange programs between educators are far from new. But Central's president, John W. Shumaker, said it was decided early on that the Connecticut-Poland program "should not be an educational exercise but should deal in reality," by providing expertise and training specifically to help get Poland into a market system.
"We didn't go to Poland to study Poles," he said. "We went to help."
 
Why Not Warsaw?
 The decision to hold the program in Wroclaw was part of that philosophy, he added. It would have been much easier to do it in Warsaw, a relatively modern and sophisticated city, but Wroclaw was chosen because "it really needed help."
Wroclaw (pronounced VROOTZ laff) is an old, remote industrial city of 650,000 in Lower Silesia near the German border. The city, its Polish leaders say, has always been a Polish city more than a German city even though before World War II it was part of Germany and known as Breslau.
One of the chief players in the Wroclaw-New Britain program is Henry S. Enck, executive assistant to the president for international development at Central Connecticut.
Until June of 1990, Mr. Enck had never been to Poland and his first visit to Wroclaw was a real revelation. He discovered that after 50 years of Communism, the leaders and educators of the city knew virtually nothing about a free-market economy. Even such simple terms as balance sheet or rates of interest were nonexistent or misunderstood.
"I saw the shambles of the Communist system," said Mr. Enck.
What was needed in Wroclaw, he said, was a quickly implemented system of getting information to college professors and high school teachers so that they could pass it along quickly. Central has been able to continue the program through more than $3 million in grants, mostly from the United States Agency for International Development -- this in an era when such money is progressively harder to come by.
Since his initial visit, Mr. Enck has been back to Wroclaw 11 times, arranging new programs and checking on progress. A Polish/English dictionary of economic terms prepared by Central is now being used by high school teachers in the Wroclaw area. Free-market business principles and practices and banking are taught at the technical college. A center has been established to encourage development of small businesses.
 
What's Communications?
 "We're also starting the first school of communications in Eastern Europe," Mr. Enck said. Eventually, he said, it will be jointly managed by the Technical University of Wroclaw and the University of Wroclaw.
Actually, simply explaining what a school of communications teaches has been difficult in Poland. There is no one word in the Polish language that means communication, in the sense of transmitting information.
"To us, communications was trains or planes," Zdzislaw B. Kremens, an official of the Technical University of Wroclaw, said recently on one of his visits to New Britain.
The one major irritant to people who have worked on the New Britain-Wroclaw connection is the seemingly endless red tape that continues unabated in Poland, no matter what the changes in government.
One person currently trying to deal with the red tape is Janusz S. Podlasek, a New Britain industrialist who, although a United States citizen, had been trapped as a child during World War II in Wloclawek, Poland, where his father had owned and operated a factory.
 
Improvements vs. Rent
 The factory has been run as a state venture since the war and currently produces radiators, said Mr. Podlasek, who is now 63. He said he has been attempting to regain the factory the past few years but keeps running into bureaucratic roadblocks.
"We have trouble agreeing on a price," he said. "They say they have made improvements to the factory. 'But you haven't paid rent in 50 years,' I say."
Despite the labyrinth of rules and regulations in Poland, Henry Enck said his university's program has been able to move forward not by ignoring them but by coping with them.
"We follow regulations to the letter but don't get strangled in them. We insist the bureaucracy respond in a timely manner," he said. "We ought to be a classic example of being suffocated by bureaucracy, but it hasn't turned out that way."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: From Paving to Lights and Trees;
Creating a Downtown Brooklyn 'Visual Identity'

 BODY:
"Brooklyn, you are the universe."
The words were those of the late novelist Bernard Malamud, who spent his childhood there, but they could describe the feelings of many Brooklyn residents, past and present. 
 Now the borough has a plan to make that universe, or at least its downtown, a little more attractive -- to tie together new developments in the area with the existing architectural fabric, improve the street environment, give the downtown a stronger identity and make more powerful Brooklyn's image as a borough of "green."
The plan, which involves both public and private funding, is called the "Downtown Brooklyn Streetscape Guidelines and Sign Program." It is the product of a study undertaken by the New York City Economic Development Corporation at the request of Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden.
The result entails design recommendations for sidewalk paving, signs, curbs, corners, crosswalks, street lighting, trees and furniture. Gray-tinted concrete, for instance, is recommended as basic paving material for retail streets, major boulevards and commercial-institutional streets, while the bluestone paving around Borough Hall sets the precedent for all sidewalks of the Civic Center streets.
The plan also recommends narrow-shaped trees to allow better visibility for signs on retail streets; spreading trees to create a "delicate, generous canopy" on Civic Center streets and major boulevards and pyramidal trees for "green canopy without blocking views" on commercial-retail streets.
The sign program includes a "vehicular trail-blazer system" tied to a distinctive logo to guide drivers to such areas as the Civic Center, MetroTech, the Fulton Mall and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. A "pedestrian orientation system" is to feature directories keyed to a downtown map with arrows pointing to major destinations.
Greg Brooks, executive assistant to Mr. Golden, said the plan was "an opportunity to create a visual identity for downtown and to create a signage program in an area that sorely needed such a program."
Mr. Brooks said that the Borough President had appropriated about $500,000 for construction to complete the sign program and that "we would like to see this going forward in the next couple of months."
"We are working with the private sector to come up with a maintenance agreement," he said. "We will implement the plan, and the private sector will be responsible for maintenance." The entire plan, he said, "is an opportunity for public-private partnership."
"In this year's capital budget there is more than $1 million for roadway infrastructure," he said. "We will choose the targeted roadwork with the private sector, and they will fund the amenities, such as lights and trees."

COMPANIES
 
Macy's? Federated? Bloomingdale's? It's All for One Now
At this rate, life will soon be elegantly simple. To shop, you'll just head for a single 20-square-block store sprawled across Midtown. Its name? Macy's-Federated-A&S-Bloomingdale's-Stern's-Etc.-Etc. Or, perhaps, simply Department Store Inc. Last week Macy's and Federated finished their long mating dance, as Macy's stopped battling to stay independent and agreed to a merger, giving birth to the nation's largest department-store company. Macy's bondholders do fairly well as the chain emerges from bankruptcy, but retail workers will probably lose out. New York-area department-store jobs have slid to 24,000 from 57,000 just 15 years ago, and more layoffs will certainly follow now. But you can't have jobs without stores: if, by joining forces, they're "better able to pay their bills," as Samuel Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor Statistics put it, "it will be better for everyone." For shoppers, that remains to be seen. 

Odd Network Out
Let's see if we've got this soap-opera plot straight. After QVC got a richer offer from Comcast, CBS and QVC decided not to go off into the sunset together -- and QVC looked about for even higher offers. Then CBS, suddenly nervous that shareholders would forsake it in its hour of need, said it would buy back 3.5 million of its shares and split its stock 5-for-1. CBS quickly vowed to go in "new directions," but the cold fact is that CBS is again out of a lot of loops -- no cable interests, no merger partners, in an age of cable and mergers. And no Barry Diller. But will Disney, rumored to have an interest in CBS, star in the next episode?
 
Just What Kennedy Needs
Kennedy Airport is constantly under construction, constantly jammed. What it needs, of course, is more construction, a new terminal, more crowds. Sure enough, last week four foreign airlines -- Air France, Lufthansa, Japan Air Lines and Korean Air Lines -- said they'd build a terminal on the old Eastern site. It'll be the first totally new terminal since 1971. Demolition will last well into 1995, enhancing the perpetual in-the-works aura, with the new terminal to open in 1998. The foreign carriers will take financing responsibility. But will they get you a cab?
 
United Workers, Owners at Last
Employees bought United Airlines last week, and you'd be excused for thinking that has an awfully familiar ring to it. Employees have been about to buy, unable to buy, dying to buy United seemingly since the dawn of air travel. After seven years of false starts and failed deals, workers have taken over, swapping $4.9 billion in wage cuts and work-rule changes for 55 percent of the company, making United one of the nation's biggest employee-controlled companies. Will it have imitators? Probably. It's a sure way to cut costs without starting over. But will workers look out for themselves before the company? That worries some observers. "Somebody's crazy." said Lee Iacocca. "It can't work."
 
Surgical Costs: Pass the Scalpel
Anyone who's been in a hospital -- or a doctor's or dentist's office -- has seen it. An array of costly doodads are trotted out, sterilized and shrouded in plastic; then, with many unused, they're discarded or sent back to be sterilized anew. Such excess, though, has no place in health care's tightfisted future, and last week that future inched a scalpel's width closer. Baxter, the big hospital supplier, made a deal with Duke University Medical Center in which Baxter and Duke both have an incentive to cut surgical-supply costs. Baxter gets Duke's business for five years, and Duke probably saves money -- though doctors will have a bit less equipment available. "If we do this right," said Dr. Mark Rogers of Duke, "we believe it will be a national model."
 
Eli Lilly Grabs the Reins
What this world needs is more Prozac. A cheerier populace would rally around health reform, and everyone could go on Prozac. Sure enough, a deal cut last week "will help sell even more Prozac," said Randall Tobias, head of Eli Lilly. Lilly, you see, makes Prozac, and in this deal, Lilly will buy PCS, one of a new corporate breed. PCS buys vast quantities of drugs -- at a discount, of course -- on behalf of health plans, and drug companies want to wrest control of their market back from these middlepeople. It's the if-you-can't-lick-'em-buy-'em approach, the very one used by Merck when it bought Medco last year.
 
Please Fasten Your Collars
Airlines battle tirelessly to keep their planes on the move, whittling the time to whisk weary passengers out, fresh passengers in, to check the oil and kick the landing gear. But the oddest things can wreak riotous havoc with this precision, as Tower Air discovered last week. En route from New York to Los Angeles, a cat fled her cargo carrier and vanished into the innards of the Boeing 747. At first Tower kept the plane hopping, searching only on pit stops. But finally the cat's dogged owner, lawsuit in hand, brought the jet to a halt at Kennedy Airport until the cat was found -- which she was, after nine hours. What price cat freedom? Please don't ask.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
For Sale: An 80's Mistake
They'd make distinctive mega-stores -- worthy, even, of Macy's-Federated. Just add escalators and some smiling attack troops brandishing perfume, and you'd be in business. What are these prize sites? Half-finished nuclear reactors, of course. The Washington Public Power Supply System, which a decade ago defaulted on the bonds to finance two plants, can't afford to finish them, tear them down or even let them sit there, so it's trying to sell them. The price: $3.4 billion. (They'll take less.) One Congressman's idea: put up a plaque, call them a monument to stupidity. Another: burn plutonium from old nuclear weapons to generate electricity. But a cylindrical department store still sounds best.
 
The 'Best' Fund? Prove It
It's one thing for, say, a peanut butter to trumpet that it's the best. Your only risk: you buy it and say, Nah, it's not that great. But when you're told you're buying the "best" mutual fund, there's a bit more at stake. Of course, all funds would like to be the best -- and many have merged wish with fact, inventing "top" rankings in ads. But last week the S.E.C. clamped down, approving guidelines on the way rankings are used in ads and brochures. The rules require "prominent disclosure" of rankings, of the funds sharing the category, and the period in question. Now those proud claims may mean a bit more.
 
You Call That Inflation?
Maybe all the inflation talk is just part of the nostalgia craze. We haven't had real inflation for so long that some people, in the guise of solemn concern, are really hungering for it, to liven things up. Will they get it? A mixed message last week. First, producer prices came in flat, a sign that no inflation's in sight. But then came an 0.3 percent rise in consumer prices (helped by a hefty 0.6 percent rise in new-vehicle prices). That adds up to just a 2.5 percent quarterly pace, but some analysts still see inflation heading upward -- and expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates again soon. But they sure don't make inflation the way they did in the old days of the early 80's.
 
And the Rich Get Schools
It's easy for a state to make its economy work: let local districts educate their own, paying for it through property taxes, and may the fittest survive. That's fine, unless your district is not among the fit. Some states have rethought the formula, with Kansas taking control of school money and Michigan turning to sales taxes. And last week New Jersey edged toward state control as its Supreme Court ruled the existing system unconstitutional, because of a lingering rich-poor gap. The property-tax approach clearly doesn't work in Newark: the state pays 74 percent of the school bill.
 
World Cup Debris, at a Price
You'd think they were buying the Pope's toothbrush, or Elvis's Brylcream-stained pillow. People eagerly paid $20 last week for a square foot of Bermuda grass that had been torn up from a well-trampled New Jersey field. Why? Well, the field was the Meadowlands, site of some serious recent soccer games, and as one proud buyer put it, "Right here on this turf Baggio walked and scored and even spit" -- Roberto Baggio of Italy being the hero of the moment. It was all part of World Cup II: The Local Take. Officials said the games pumped $500 million into the regional economy, including $200 million for New York City. Give or take some old sod.

HEADLINE: Europe Inc. Has a Novel Idea: Cut Costs

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: AUGSBURG, Germany

 BODY:
SIGNS of change abound at Siemens Nixdorf's personal computer factory here.
The German technology company slashed the number of production workers to 1,000 from 1,300 earlier this year even as it added a third shift. Pay is being tied for the first time to meeting quality and volume goals. Engineers, who once focused on designing the most sophisticated possible product, now concentrate on making the assembly process more efficient. 
 For anyone at the plant who missed the message that Siemens Nixdorf is getting serious about cutting costs, improving productivity and abandoning the traditional German way of doing things as it struggles against rabid worldwide competition, there is also this: The employee cafeteria no longer serves beer.
"We have had to re-engineer more or less the whole company," said Hans-Dieter Wiedig, the chief executive of Siemens Nixdorf, which has been suffering heavy losses but hopes to break even next year. "In this kind of competitive environment, the only constant is change."
The words may be familiar, even hackneyed, to executives in most industries in the United States, who came to the same realization years ago and have been acting on it ever since.
But belated though it may be, what is happening here, some 50 miles northwest of Munich, is happening, with various degrees of urgency, throughout Western Europe at companies in nearly every industry.
Having seen its share of world markets eroding for years, European business is at last seeking to remake itself, conscious that it is in danger of being left hopelessly behind more efficient American and Asian competitors in the cutthroat worldwide race for sales, profits and survival.
 
Long List of Problems
 Whether Western European companies are moving fast enough and aggressively enough to catch up remains to be seen. But at the very least, corporate executives -- and to a lesser extent workers and political leaders -- are facing up to a list of problems that has grown long and familiar.
Employment levels remain bloated at many companies. Labor costs in Germany are the world's highest (an hourly average of $25.56 last year, including benefits), and are high in most other European nations as well. The cost of providing universal medical care, generous pensions and long vacations has become prohibitive. Energy, raw materials, even a phone call -- all are more expensive in Europe than in the United States or Japan.
Strong unions limit the kind of slash-and-burn cost-cutting that is common in the United States -- especially with unemployment already near or above 10 percent in most European countries. The high cost of hiring and firing workers discourages companies from doing either.
The ongoing transformation of Europe into a single market, which offered the promise of economies of scale, has not lived up to the expectations of most companies, which complain that trade remains inhibited by continuing legal, regulatory, tax and cultural differences among nations.
And there has been only tentative progress in addressing the issues on the national level. Spain, for example, recently made it easier for companies to hire part-time or temporary workers. And other European governments are spending more time studying Britain, where the Conservative Government over the last 15 years has swept away rigid labor laws, weakened the unions, dropped most trade barriers -- and seen foreign investment and productivity surge.
On a company-by-company basis, however, continental Europe has unquestionably become the scene of frenetic efforts to become more competitive with the United States and Japan -- arguably the region's biggest industrial challenge since rebuilding after World War II.
"The restoration of long-term economic growth in Europe is certainly feasible," said Sir Michael Perry, the chairman of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company. "But it is heavily dependent on improved industrial and business competitiveness."
In industries like computers where there are few trade barriers to true global competition, and in those like automobiles where traditional trade protection is disappearing, European companies are moving rapidly. Mercedes-Benz has cut $1.4 billion from annual operating costs in the last two years, and is expected to return to profitability this year as auto sales rebound.
But progress has been slower in industries ranging from steelmaking to banking, and the process of shrinking to a realistic size and cost structure is just getting under way in nationalized sectors such as telecommunications and airlines. Many companies remain reliant on subsidies from their governments -- subsidies that shelter them from the need to take drastic action.
For example, Alitalia, the Italian airline, won agreement from its unions last week to eliminate 1,570 of its 20,000 jobs over the next several years. But the unions forced the airline to back down from plans to cut 2,000 more jobs. Analysts say the state-owned company will still be unable to survive without huge Government subsidies.
Many European companies are breathing easier now that the recession is ending and sales and profits are turning up. In Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, the deleterious economic effects of unification with East Germany are fading. High unemployment and low inflation have allowed many European companies to hold down wage increases. At the same time, however, many business leaders say economic recovery will not carry away deep-rooted structural problems and that the process of corporate renewal will have to continue unabated if Europe is to make a comeback.
 
Ongoing 'Cost Crisis'
 "The cost crisis has in no way been overcome," Klaus Murmann, the president of the German employers federation, said at a news conference last month.
Moreover, Western Europe is starting out with so much ground to make up against the United States and Japan that even big steps forward have left European industry far behind.
A survey last year by McKinsey & Company of nine large manufacturing industries in Germany, the United States and Japan found that Germany was the productivity leader in not a single one. (Japan led in five, including auto parts and steel, and the United States in four, including computers and beer.)
European productivity is clearly improving. A recent study by Deutsche Bank calculated that productivity, after rising only slightly from 1989 to 1993, will jump sharply this year and next as cost-cutting programs and investment in new technology pay off. Measured by cash flow (earnings before depreciation, interest and taxes) per employee, European productivity will be up by 36.9 percent at the end of 1995 compared with 1989, according to the bank.
In that same period, however, productivity in the United States will have risen by 56.6 percent, the bank said, reflecting the all-out effort by American companies to improve their competitiveness since the start of the last recession.
Japanese productivity will actually have fallen during the six-year period in cash flow terms, in part because the strength of the yen has made its products more costly abroad, hurting sales and profits. But Japan will remain the productivity leader in absolute terms (85,653 German marks worth of cash flow per employee in 1995, or $55,260 at current exchange rates), with the United States (82,082 marks, or $52,956) just behind and Europe (38,455 marks, or $24,809) trailing badly.
Other measures of competitiveness vary in how far behind Europe stands, or in how much ground it is making up. But the bottom line is that for years Europe has been losing business to international competitors. Western Europe's share of world export markets fell from 23.7 percent in 1972 to 18.3 percent in 1992, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to a study by the Confederation of British Industry.
Against such a background, companies like Siemens Nixdorf are being forced to re-examine their entire method of doing business. The experience at Siemens Nixdorf suggests how far many European companies are going in their effort to remain in the race, but also how difficult it is for them to compete globally.
The changes are apparent from top to bottom at the company. Mr. Wiedig, the chief executive, is moving to another post within the parent company, Siemens A. G., in October, after spending years reassessing and modifying nearly every aspect of the company's business practices.
Breaking with long tradition, the company will bring in an outsider to replace him -- Gerhard Schulmeyer from ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., the Zurich-based engineering and power generation equipment company that is Europe's standard-setter for lean management and production.
Under Mr. Wiedig, Siemens Nixdorf has been extremely aggressive by German standards in slashing employment and operating costs. The product of a 1990 merger of Siemens's computer businesses and Nixdorf, an innovative but financially troubled German technology company, Siemens Nixdorf has reduced its workforce to 38,000, from 53,000, over the last four years.
Because of the high costs of layoffs, retirements and transfers under German law, the process of shedding those jobs cost the company more than one billion marks -- or more than $43,000 per job -- an expense that many companies without Siemens's sound financial base would have been reluctant to take on.
By virtue of being in the computer business, Siemens Nixdorf has had to be even more aggressive in improving efficiency than its parent, which retains a reputation for being one of Germany's flabbiest big companies. Within Siemens Nixdorf, no division is under more cost pressure than the personal computer business, based here in Augsburg.
The PC industry is one of the world's most unrelentingly competitive, with Compaq, the leader, driving prices down as much as 20 percent a year. Given that it has also been working out the kinks from its merger, Siemens Nixdorf has by many measures made impressive progress in its PC operations.
Take its effort to streamline assembly of keyboards. Several years ago, the keyboard required assembly of 150 parts. Now, through advances in chip technology and with more components pre-assembled, only four parts need to be put together. The keyboards snap together rather than require screws.
The old keyboard took 32 minutes to assemble at a cost of 120 marks, or about $77 at current exchange rates. The new one takes 2 and a half minutes to produce at one-fourth the cost.
The company has made heavy investments in technology on the production line. A new testing machine, for example, takes only 1 minute to examine a circuit board, versus 2 and a half minutes for an older model.
Total production time for a PC has been cut in half, to 30 minutes. The line is now running at or near capacity, operating 22 hours a day to produce 2,000 PC's.
 
Aiming High
 If it all sounds very much like what Compaq has done to become the PC industry cost leader, it is no accident. "Best in class is the target for us," said Walter Rossler, general manager of Siemens's PC business.
Mr. Rossler said he is 90 percent of the way to reaching his manufacturing cost targets. Management consultants have never been popular among German companies, but Mr. Rossler recently hired McKinsey to examine the PC operation's costs.
The study found the costs out of line with global competitors only in non-production areas -- so-called selling, general and administrative costs, which at Compaq are about 12 to 15 percent of sales compared with more than 20 percent at Siemens, Mr. Rossler said.
But the PC business is a bit of an anomaly, even within Siemens Nixdorf, and certainly within the parent company and German industry generally. Labor costs amount to only 2 to 3 percent of total costs in the PC business, compared with 30 percent across all of Siemens Nixdorf, which sells a broad range of computers, software and integration services.
As important as reducing the workforce, Mr. Wiedig said, is changing the attitudes of those who remain. Engineers, for example, have had to learn that they can no longer design every part or assume that the company will build everything for itself -- the German tradition -- because it is often cheaper in the computer business to purchase components from suppliers, often in lower-cost nations.
Production workers remain among the best paid within the industry worldwide -- labor costs average 28 marks, or $18, an hour -- but a portion of total compensation now comes in the form of bonuses for meeting quality and volume targets. Employees said they are not totally happy that the old ways are coming to an end, but that they are well aware that the company's future rests largely with their willingness to be more flexible -- a real cultural change in the heavily unionized workforce.
"Costs could be a problem," said Petra Findeisen, a worker who was loading software onto hard disks at the PC factory here. "We have to be creative and remember that quality is No. 1."
For the PC business, the changes have had a payoff, at least in the short run. The company increased its share of the European PC market to 3.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, up from 2.5 percent in the same period last year and leaving it fourth behind Compaq, I.B.M. and Apple. Its goal next year is a 5 percent share. In Germany it is No. 3, with a 10.2 percent share, behind Compaq and Vobis, a German retailer and clone maker.
But Siemens Nixdorf clearly has a long way to go if it is to be anything more than a marginal player in the computer business. Prices in PC's are expected to continue falling at 20 percent or more a year, putting intense pressure on the operation to continue cutting costs, a prospect that it might find more difficult than larger rivals that enjoy greater economies of scale.
"The problem quite simply is costs," said Andrew Haskins, an analyst at James Capel in London. "An enormous amount of work still has to be done."
 
 
 
HOW AMERICAN COMPANIES COPE, OR DON'T
 EDGAR S. WOOLARD JR., the chairman of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the American chemicals giant, recently asked a group of European executives and government officials in Brussels a provocative question: "Would the chief executive of a multinational company with $1 billion to invest choose to invest in Europe in the next decade?"
Mr. Woolard, whose company has 30 manufacturing sites and $13 billion in annual sales in Europe, gave a downbeat answer: "Our observation is that right now many large companies are directing their discretionary investment to other parts of the world."
For American companies like Du Pont and for other foreign corporations, Europe is as difficult an operating environment as it is for Europeans. And that fact is clearly costing Europe new foreign investments and the jobs that come with them.
"Consider one example -- the issue of improving efficiency in the workplace," Mr. Woolard said. "Instead of engaging in a dialogue about institutional barriers to streamlining the production process, we have witnessed in Europe a long, unresolved debate about procedural mechanisms for consultation with workers. Meanwhile in other regions, new work systems are being experimented with, adopted and transformed to make companies more aggressive, customer-oriented and productive."
Western Europe suffers from many other problems, Mr. Woolard said. Besides high operating and labor costs, he said, there is evidence that it lags in developing new products in terms of speed and quality.
Certainly Europe can be troublesome for multinational companies trying to slim themselves down. When the Gillette Company announced plans in March to close a razor blade plant near Seville, Spain, and lay off 250 workers, the plant manager was threatened, presumably by disgruntled employees, and had to hire bodyguards. The regional government threatened a legal challenge. Nearly four months later, Gillette is still trying to reach a deal the way Spanish law says it must: through a negotiated settlement with the plant's unions.
Some American and Japanese manufacturers have found a happy home in Europe -- but more often than not in Britain. Attracted by the country's relatively low level of labor regulation, social welfare costs and union strength, all the major Japanese car companies have established their primary European production plants in Britain. And American computer companies, including I.B.M. and Compaq, have some of their most efficient plants in Scotland.

HEADLINE: The 'Moncton Miracle': Bilingual Phone Chat

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: MONCTON, New Brunswick

 BODY:
THE big blow to this community came in 1988 when the government-owned Canadian National Railways, closed its Moncton repair yard in a cost-cutting drive, idling 2,000 workers.
Many of the jobless spoke both English and French, like Louis Melanson, who was hired by the railroad after high school and labored at the Moncton yard for nine years, mostly behind his welder's blowtorch. 
 Today, Mr. Melanson is one of hundreds of bilingual workers who are transforming the former rail hub into the Omaha of Canada -- a telemarketing and customer-service telephone call-center capital.
Wearing the earphones that are the symbol of his new profession, the 34-year-old Mr. Melanson sits in an office cubicle in a big new building, around the corner from the Moncton railroad station.
He works for Purolator Courier of Canada, the nation's largest overnight courier service, which came to Moncton two years ago, attracted by the area's bilingual workers, a state-of-the-art phone system and lower wage rates than in the company's home province of Ontario. In addition, New Brunswick lifted its provincial sales tax on toll-free 800 numbers.
"We chose Moncton as one of the most cost-effective locations for telemarketing and corporate support offices in all of North America," says Fred Manske, Purolator's chief executive officer. (Canada's Purolator was once a subsidiary of the American company of the same name, but a group of investors bought the Canadian courier unit in 1987. American Purolator, a producer of oil filters, is no longer in the courier business.)
Mr. Melanson is among those hired to take calls about pickups and package-tracing from Quebec and other provinces seven days a week. He and his co-workers in neighboring cubicles field nearly 20,000 calls a day.
Others do data entry and billing operations. Altogether, Purolator accounts for 400 new Moncton jobs. It and other companies with similar operations have added nearly 2,000 jobs to the local economy, almost making up for those lost when the rail yard shut down in 1988.
Frank McKenna, New Brunswick's two-term premier is one of the policy architects of the economic rehabilitation that he likes to call the "Moncton Miracle." Bilingualism and the adaptation of new computer and communications technologies, he says, represent "our ticket on the uptown bus."
While repairing railcars, Mr. Melanson never realized his accentless English and French would be the key to a future job.
"It certainly has a lot of bearing now," he observes, adding with a grin. "No more heavy smoke and my hands stay clean."
His French is a carryover from the region's Acadian past. Nearly half the 106,000 people of Greater Moncton and many others in northern New Brunswick and Nova Scotia descend from the French farmers who settled here 200 to 300 years ago.
The Acadians' history, distinct from that of other French settlers in Quebec, was marked by a brutal deportation by the British between 1755 and 1763 -- recounted by Longfellow in his "Evangeline."
Yet because large numbers of English-speakers also settled in the two maritime provinces, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, bilingualism is more widely practiced here than in Quebec, where a hard-line group of the population has long promoted not only French linguistic hegemony but physical separation from Canada as a French-speaking republic.
Eric M. Robichaud, president of the Greater Moncton Economic Commission, said the fading rail industry "forced us to realize we had a problem and then to recognize that the bilingualism of our work force that we had long taken for granted was a tool we could market."
To support the development effort, English- and French-speaking community colleges now even provide courses in telemarketing to eager bilingual students.
Moreover, Moncton has become the home of this nation's Telemarketing Industry Association (45 member companies ranging in size from one to 1,300 employees), whose mission is to promote Canadian call center operations as a "professional and leading edge industry."
Besides Purolator, the companies that have set up telemarketing or customer service operations here include Federal Express, the American courier service, Camco, a leading Canadian maker of household appliances, and Business-to-Business Telemarketing, which handles telemarketing for other companies on a contract basis. Last week, the Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's largest bank, announced that it plans to establish a big call center here.
New Brunswick isn't the only province trying to attract the new customer-service and telemarketing operations. Manitoba and Nova Scotia, also with French-speaking minorities, are pressing their case as well.
They, too, have lifted the provincial sales tax on 1-800 numbers. Manitoba offers favorable lending terms for capital equipment and software development. Nova Scotia also offers a range of incentives, which may have helped turn back an effort of New Brunswick to snatch a Sears Canada, Inc. operation away from Halifax.
Yet nowhere is the pool of bilingual workers greater than New Brunswick, although in annual operating costs, the three provinces are roughly on a par.
Helped by the weakening Canadian dollar, they all do well in comparisons with the United States. A study by Boyd Company Inc., location consultants of Princeton, N.J., showed that at the end of last year, the annual operating costs of a call center in Greater Monckton were below those of 24 sites in the United States. The closest American rivals were Panama City, Fla., Salt Lake City and Omaha.
"For communities to be successful in economic development, they must sell their core competencies," says Jim Gilligan, Toronto-based location consultant who for PHH Fantus Inc. "Clearly, in Moncton the people realize bilingualism is an asset and are running hard with it."

HEADLINE: Blurred Images of North Korea's 'Junior'

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Depending on who is doing the talking, Kim Jong Il is a depraved movie fan who abuses women and alcohol; a terrorist who masterminded the 1983 bombing of the South Korean Cabinet and the 1987 midair bombing of a South Korean airliner; an awkward, misunderstood technocrat who longs to be a statesman, or all, some or none of the above.
The sharply divergent views underscore the scarcity of reliable information about the portly 52-year-old who has begun to emerge as North Korea's new leader, a man American intelligence officials still refer to as "junior" or "the kid." 
 President Clinton sounded as baffled as everyone else when he was asked about Mr. Kim last Monday, three days after the death of his father, Kim Il Sung, the world's longest-ruling dictator. "I don't know the younger Kim," Mr. Clinton said. "And I think you have to be careful in judging people by what others say about them one way or the other."
Kim-watchers spun themselves into an analytical frenzy overnight when the funeral of the father, set for Sunday, was suddenly postponed. But by this morning, officials in Seoul suggested that the succession was on track. [Page 10.]
Mr. Kim's prospects, character and personal habits would hardly matter if the stakes were not so high for both Asia and the world. For he appears to be taking over what the Clinton Administration says is a rogue regime that may already have one or two nuclear bombs.
Few outsiders have ever met him, and he has rarely traveled outside the country. Much of what is said to be known about him is suspect because it comes from defectors whose views have been filtered through South Korean intelligence. When foreign visitors ask to meet him, as former President Jimmy Carter did during his recent trip, they are told he is out among the people in the countryside.
Both American and South Korean intelligence officials are so in the dark about Mr. Kim that they are reduced to analyzing frames from North Korean television of such seemingly minor details as changes in his weight, his elevator shoes, his pompadour hairdo and a sometimes drooping lower lip.
The information void has sparked a ferocious debate within the Administration -- both between the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency and within the C.I.A. itself -- over who he is, what his intentions are and whether he will be able to fill the vast political vacuum left by his father's death.
The more benign view, shared by the State Department and some analysts in the C.I.A., is that while Mr. Kim may be eccentric, he has run the day-to-day operations of the country for some time, is now clearly in charge and may emerge eventually as a responsible leader.
The other view, shared by much of the C.I.A. and the Pentagon establishment, is that Mr. Kim is a Stalinist killer like his father. But because, unlike his father, he is not a national hero and does not have the respect of officials of the older generation or much of the military, he will be unable to make concessions on his country's nuclear program and lacks the charisma and standing to survive politically.
The backbiting has become so intense that different bureaus and agencies have inundated policymakers with hundreds of pages of often-contradictory analyses. "The situation we've gotten ourselves into can only be described as nutty," a longtime Korea watcher said.
 
A Gracious Host Open to the U.S.
 A few close-up, if isolated, snapshots of Mr. Kim exist.
An Italian businessman, Carlo Baeli, describes Mr. Kim as a gentle soul, solicitous of his guests, curious about business and politics, and eager to have good relations with the United States.
"The thing that struck me most about him was his simplicity," Mr. Baeli said of a five-hour encounter on the Korean's yacht in September 1992. "He was very simple in how he met me, simple through the meal we had, simple when he said goodbye. He's very versatile and has a good sense of humor. Once the world meets the man, they'll realize that he's not the man described up to now."
Mr. Baeli, 61, the president of a Rome-based exporting company, Compagnia Internationale Scambi con l'Estero, has a $120 million contract to sell finishing machinery for marble and gold to North Korea. He may not be the most objective witness, but he is one of the only ones.
Dining on fish antipasto and grilled shrimp, drinking Hennessy brandy and French wine aboard the yacht, the two men toasted their friendship and mused about the world as military and political aides stood by, Mr. Baeli said.
"He asked first about the Italian economy, how things were going in Italy," Mr. Baeli said this week in a telephone interview from Rome. "Since we also have a Moscow office, he asked of my impressions of Russia. His sentiments toward the United States seemed to be very good. He wanted to have direct ties to the United States and not ties through other countries.
"He said they, the North Koreans, were ready and open to collaborate with the United States, and that they were already collaborating on research into Americans who died during the Korean War. He said: 'We are men and sooner or later we should come to an understanding. There is no reason for us to be enemies of the United States.' "
At one point, Mr. Kim was concerned that his guest might be tired, so he asked an aide to bring them fishing rods and they fished off the side of the yacht. As the afternoon wore on, Mr. Baeli said, "We spoke of work, politics, music, theater.
"We spoke mainly of the shows put on in North Korea where up to 5,000 characters are on stage. Apparently Kim is the inspiration of these shows."
 
Self-Consciousness And Boyish Bravado
 Choe Eun Hee, a well-known South Korean actress, and her husband, Shin Sang Ok, a filmmaker, have a different view. The two, who say they were kidnapped and taken to North Korea on Mr. Kim's orders in 1978, describe Mr. Kim as a late-night partygoer who drank hard and terrified those around him.
Ms. Choe and Mr. Shin, who escaped into the care of the C.I.A. eight years after they arrived in the North, later wrote a book about Mr. Kim, which has been published in Korean and Japanese.
The C.I.A., which financially supported and physically protected the couple for three years after their defection, finds their tale believable; other Korean analysts inside and outside the Administration are skeptical. Both Mr. Shin and Ms. Choe were traveling and unavailable for comment, according to an assistant in their Los Angeles office.
In the book, "The True Story of Kim Jong Il," Mr. Kim is portrayed as a complicated, spoiled man obsessed with building up North Korea's film industry with their help, accustomed to getting his way and self-conscious about his height. "Well, Madame Choe, what do you think of my physique?" Mr. Kim asked Ms. Choe when they first met. "Small as a midget's dropping, aren't I?"
He terrified her by serving a special wine with a live snake inside the bottle, drove a motorboat at breakneck speed, enjoyed grown-up toys like a battery-operated car, summoned her to parties in the middle of the night, once ordered the circus to perform for them after midnight and surrounded himself with sycophants who leapt to their feet to act on his whims, she wrote.
Once, she told him he should play golf to get some exercise. "All right," he laughed. "I'll make some golf courses and from now on I'll play golf."
Mr. Shin related an incident in which a drunken Mr. Kim seemed disdainful of the personality cult around him. As a musical band of young women jumped and shouted "Long live the dear Comrade Leader," Mr. Kim said, "Mr. Shin, all that is bogus. It's all just pretense."
 
Imperial Upbringing In a Communist Era

This much is known about Mr. Kim. He was born on Feb. 16, 1942, in Siberia, although the official North Korean version is that he was born amid bright lights and double rainbows at the top of Mount Paektu, a sacred peak on the Korean border with China. His mother died when he was 7, and he was evacuated to Manchuria during the Korean War before being sent to a school for the children of the elite in Pyongyang.
After graduating with a degree in political economy from Kim Il Sung University, Mr. Kim worked in the headquarters of the Korean Workers Party, where he became a powerful figure.
In a move more imperial than Communist, Kim Il Sung began to groom his son as his successor in the early 1970's. The younger Kim moved to solidify his power base in 1972, when he created the "three main revolutionary squads" to instill loyalty among young college graduates.
Mr. Kim officially became his father's successor in 1980 and was given the title of Marshal of the Armed Forces in April 1992. He is married, with either two or four children.
He is believed to have operational responsibility for the country's nuclear program and is credited with masterminding the North's experiment with a free trade zone in a remote area near the Chinese and Russian borders. But in a speech disseminated in his name in January 1992, he called on North Korea's leaders to learn lessons from the failure of the Soviet system, calling the revival of capitalism "only a local and passing phenomenon."
Since the death of his father, the official media have referred to him as "the Great Successor," although he has not been formally been given his father's titles of head of the party, President or "Great Leader."
The death of the father has prompted analysts inside and outside the Administration to look anew at the son and the question of whether he can maintain his father's rigid control while somehow dealing with North Korea's worsening economic problems.
Robert M. Gates, the former Director of Central Intelligence, said of Mr. Kim, "He is not unstable or crazy, just weird."
"You've got to start from the premise that he grew up in the shadow of one of most brutal dictators in the post-war period," said Mr. Gates, "and there is nothing to suggest that his approach to power would be any different."
That view is still largely shared by analysts at the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which in an unclassified report last December called Mr. Kim "paranoid, spoiled and suspicious." Although the report predicted that he would initially seize power, it added, "His limited personal ability, possible widespread opposition and the continuing poor economic and social conditions could lead to a coup."
But other analysts are convinced that Mr. Kim must be both judged as a man who has been waiting in the wings for too long and viewed with a fresh eye now that he is on stage. State Department officials who have met North Koreans for more than a year to discuss the country's nuclear program reported that after the father's death, their counterparts clearly acted as if the son were in charge and there would not be any surprises.
This view is shared by Mr. Baeli. "Few people know him and now the world will have to get to know him," he said. "If he becomes President, he will no longer simply speak, he has to act. And all your questions will have answers soon."

HEADLINE: TO THE MOON: 25 Years After Apollo;
25 Years Later, Moon Race in Eclipse

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
Two American astronauts landed and walked on the moon 25 years ago, taking the first human footsteps on another world. Bundled in oxygen cocoons, they hopped in low-gravity slow motion over the lifeless surface as in a dream that had to be seen in those grainy television images to be believed.
Their achievement was a spectacular American triumph in the cold war with the Soviet Union, culminating an eight-year, $25 billion mobilization of technology and talent, bringing together multitudes of scientists, engineers and technicians. 
 But the wonder now evoked by the lunar landing is that the United States so recently had the optimism to conceive such a grand undertaking and the will to see it through in a blink of history's eye -- and then so readily abandoned the enterprise. Perhaps that is why an air of melancholy, a dispiriting sense of unfulfilled promise, hangs over the Apollo 11 anniversary, and why even the space agency is doing little to celebrate its greatest moment.
Anniversaries speak in echoes of what was and what might have been.
Echoes in this case of the heavy thunder of the Saturn 5 rocket, which shook the Florida ground for miles around and lifted Neil A. Armstrong, Col. Buzz Aldrin and Col. Michael Collins on their way on July 16, 1969. Echoes of the heart-stopping lunar landing by Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin, with mere seconds of fuel remaining, on July 20. And echoes of the crackling radio link when Mr. Armstrong first stepped on the gray powdery surface of the Sea of Tranquillity and solemnly proclaimed, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
In the euphoria of the moment, when the age-old symbol of the unattainable had been reached, people allowed themselves to ascribe transcendental significance to the historic event. This was sure to be the true opening of far-ranging human space travel. The species was no longer confined to its native planet. A few observers compared the achievement with the emergence of vertebrates from primordial waters, establishing life on land. In centuries to come, some historians predicted, the 20th century might be remembered for little else.
In sobering retrospect, no one can be so sure of the lasting meaning of the first lunar landing. The moon is only three days away, 240,000 miles, but no astronauts have made the journey in 22 years. It may be decades, or even longer, before anyone establishes lunar bases or sets out for Mars.
 
'A Few Tentative Steps'
 The Apollo experience reminds Dr. Carl Sagan, the Cornell University astronomer and author, of "a toddler who takes a few tentative steps outward and then, breathless, retreats to the safety of his mother's skirts."
This turn of events is frustrating to space scientists and engineers, especially those from the glory days of Apollo. Back when they could not reliably get a rocket off the ground, they were pressed by a fearful nation to spare no expense and beat the Soviet Union. Now that they have greater expertise and more elaborate technologies, they find themselves with little political or popular support. No one is asking them for the moon.
Historians, political scientists and other observers of the space endeavor offer explanations. As successful as Apollo was in meeting its immediate objective, the lunar landing, the project's limitations as a template for future space exploration became readily apparent. It was hugely expensive. It required unstinting effort and a commitment not easily sustained once the goal was achieved.
"It was a crash program, and countries can afford that only once in a while," said Dr. Alex Roland, a history professor at Duke University and former historian of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "Apollo was a one-time event, not a pattern for some steady-state operation."
Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said: "Apollo was a warlike mobilization undertaken in conditions of perceived crisis. We had a clear enemy, high confidence that it was technologically achievable and didn't have to modify human behavior. But once the crisis went away, space exploration on such a scale was not sustainable."
 
Driven by the Cold War
 Indeed, historians say, Apollo was the product of special circumstances not likely to recur any time soon, if ever. It was a bold American response in 1961 to ominous Soviet military and space challenges of the cold war. It was undertaken in the continuing flush of postwar prosperity, when American economic power was still undisputed. American self-confidence and a sense of destiny had yet to be shaken by assassinations, urban riots, rampant crime, the divisive Vietnam War and the paralyzing burden of debt.
President John F. Kennedy made the decision in May 1961. Ever since the Russians had launched the first spacecraft, Sputnik 1, in October 1957, Americans had been uneasy about Soviet power -- a launching vehicle can also be an intercontinental missile -- and concerned about their country's technological and military capabilities. More Soviet "space firsts" followed, including the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first man to orbit Earth, on April 12, 1961. A few days later, Kennedy and the American people were further unsettled by the botched Bay of Pigs invasion, an effort to wrest Cuba from Fidel Castro.
That was when Kennedy asked Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson to consult with experts and high-ranking officials to determine if there was any space program that "promises dramatic results in which we could win."
For several years, the space agency had been developing plans for Earth-orbiting laboratories and trips to the moon. Dr. Wernher von Braun, the rocket scientist, wrote to Vice President Johnson: "We have a sporting chance of sending a three-man crew around the moon ahead of the Soviets." He added that the United States had "an excellent chance of beating the Soviets to the first landing of a crew on the moon (including return capability, of course)."
In a famous address to Congress on May 25, President Kennedy declared, "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth."
The project had its critics, who thought the money could be better spent on domestic needs or complained of its marginal scientific and military benefits. But Apollo was about politics and the cold war. It was to be a demonstration of American power and resolve. More than that, it was an expression of faith that people could still go forth and claim the future.
 
Steady Goals, but Changing Times
 By the time Apollo 11 landed, however, the spirit of 1961 was unrecognizable. The country had changed in eight years, drained of self-confidence in the Vietnam jungles and burning city streets. Six more missions followed Apollo 11, and five of them landed on the moon. The last of the 12 men to walk on the moon were the Apollo 17 astronauts, in December 1972. Three subsequent missions were canceled.
Looking beyond Apollo soon after the first lunar landing, a White House panel endorsed much of NASA's wish list when it proposed an ambitious program of bases on the moon, space stations circling it and even larger Earth-orbiting laboratories capable of supporting 50 to 100 people. The ringing encore would be a human expedition to Mars in the 1980's, at the earliest, or no later than the end of this century.
"That was NASA at its worst," said John E. Pike, a space policy analyst for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. "It was all 'how' and no 'why.' "
But to most people, Apollo 11 had been an ending, not a beginning; the moon race was over, and there would be no more blank checks for space. All the proposals were quietly shelved, except for one to develop a reusable spacecraft, which President Richard M. Nixon approved in early 1972. But the space shuttles eventually developed were not fully reusable and have never lived up to extravagant forecasts that they would be flying 40 or 50 missions a year by the 1990's, instead of the current rate of seven or eight.
"People always talk about the 'Kennedy effect,' " said Dr. Walter A. McDougall, a University of Pennsylvania historian and author of the acclaimed political history of the space age, "The Heavens and the Earth" (Basic Books, 1986)."But once the moon race was won, people lost interest, and even a Kennedy probably could not have maintained a brighter post-Apollo program. Perhaps it's not unreasonable that the human race, once it had first mastered the art of rocket flight, would engage in a great burst of exploration, followed by a long pause to regroup and rethink the economics of space and then proceed in a more pragmatic fashion."
 
NASA Lowers Its Sights
 In any event, lower budgets, a lack of clearly defined goals and dwindling political support left the space agency adrift. Although President Ronald Reagan finally gave his approval in 1984, the space station program has taken two years more than it took to put the first Apollo on the moon, and the station is still not off the ground.
On the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11, President George Bush pledged that Mars would be the country's new space goal, with humans landing there by the year 2019, the golden anniversary of the first lunar landing. Nothing more was heard of this because Congress refused to finance it.
It is little wonder that sadness and a sense of betrayal creep into the recollections of Apollo participants. Dr. Robert C. Seamans Jr., NASA's deputy administrator during some of the Apollo years, recalled conversations he had with James E. Webb, the politically skilled leader of NASA in the 1960's, not long before Mr. Webb's death in 1992.
"We thought we were laying a foundation for future space exploration," Dr. Seamans said. "We thought after Apollo we wouldn't need to go back to the drawing board for whole new sets of vehicles. But that's what happened when they disbanded the whole Saturn-Apollo operation and hardware and chose to start all over again with the shuttle."
Mr. Pike of the Federation of American Scientists said, "The problem over the last 25 years was that we were not able to develop a compelling geopolitical rationale for any space program since Apollo that lasted long enough to get anything done."
 
New Role for Space Station
 A major civilian space program has now been identified with an important foreign policy objective, Mr. Pike noted, and the paradox is that this time it involves cooperation with the Russians, not confrontation. President Clinton won substantial support for the space station this year by bringing in the Russians, thus trying through cooperation in space to help insure the success of Russian democracy.
Dr. McDougall counseled patience. After all, he noted, it was 50 years after Magellan made the first crossing of the Pacific before the Spanish finally managed to go back in 1571 and establish a permanent base on the other side, at Manila. If the costs of rocket technology are substantially reduced, Dr. McDougall said, there could be a new rush to go to space, although the leader might not be the United States, but Japan.
Daniel S. Goldin, the current NASA Administrator, acknowledged that he had discouraged official Apollo retrospectives. "We can spend so much time reviewing history that we're not writing any more history," he said.
Another anniversary echo from the time of the lunar landing brings back the oft-repeated question, "If we can send men to the moon, why can't we . . ." cure cancer, rebuild the cities, or whatever. At first, the question was asked in earnest, an expression of impatience and hope. Now, if it is asked at all, the tone is one of despair and self-reproach. Apollo may have been a success, Dr. Logsdon of George Washington University said, but not as a model for attacking other concerns, not unless the goal can be as clearly defined, as amenable to a straightforward technological solution and as strongly supported.
In years to come, people may look back on Apollo as a historical anomaly -- a small step -- or as the inspired beginning of space travel and human life on other worlds -- truly a giant leap for mankind. Those who experienced the thrill of that beginning will never know the ultimate outcome.
 
Mystery of Absent 'A'
 Everyone expected Neil A. Armstrong to say something memorable at the moment of his first footstep on the moon, and he obliged. But something about the one small step/one giant leap quotation seemed to be missing.
The words heard and recorded at Mission Control in Houston were, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." But Mr. Armstrong said after the flight that he had intended to say, "small step for a man." The space agency left the impression that the missing article had been lost because of the radio static.
In an interview in 1971, the journalist Robert Sherrod asked Mr. Armstrong if the "a" had been lost in transmission or simply forgotten.
"We'll never know," the Apollo 11 commander replied, leaving one more enigma lingering about this very private astronaut.
 
Faded Spirit of Apollo
 Will there ever be another Apollo? In a catalog for a Library of Congress exhibit a decade after the first landing, the answer given is: probably not.
"We have changed as a people," the catalog noted in 1979. "No longer possessing the headiness and naivete of past times, we are spared the disappointments of risky ventures. Yet we also forgo the exuberance and elation of bold attempts. While still a vital people, we have been thrown off balance by a series of foreign and domestic disasters and disappointments, which, in the short run, have made us somewhat wary."
It added, "The face we present to the world appears indecisive."

Chronology/Diagrams/Photos: "To The Moon and Beyond: 50 Years in Space"
 From man's first step into space with Sputnik 1 to Apollo 11's landing on the moon, space exploration was largely fueled during its first 12 years by the competition of the cold war. With shrinking budgets for space programs, the success of the Space Station Freedom and other future projects will depend on international cooperation.

HEADLINE: Despite Talk of Invasion, Haiti's Terror Continues

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 16

 BODY:
The United Nations observers had presented themselves at the airport in compliance with an expulsion order, but Haiti's military could not resist inflicting a few humiliations.
Before the group boarded the plane this week, soldiers acting as functionaries poked through their belongings and contemptuously questioned the validity of some of their passports. 
"The soldiers at the airport were acting as arrogant and cocky as I have ever seen them," said a diplomat who witnessed the departure of the 92-member mission, which had been monitoring human rights abuses here for more than a year. "They were looking very sure of themselves."
 
Facade of Fearlessness
 Haiti's military leaders may just be putting up a brave front for the rest of the world, but they continue to act as if they have no fear of a United States invasion. The order to expel the combined observer mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States came hours after four American amphibious assault ships carrying 2,000 marines arrived in Haitian waters.
Immediately after the rights observers were expelled, a dozen men whose identities remain unknown were killed and secretly buried in a small town just west of here. Government officials describe the victims as car thieves who had been caught stripping United Nations vehicles and were killed in a gun battle with soldiers and police, but the American Embassy isn't buying the story.
"The motive was clearly political," an embassy spokesman, Stanley Schrager, said Friday. The embassy investigated the killings in the absence of the rights observers and concluded, he said, that the dead men had been "murdered by, or on behalf of Government security elements."
The leader of the armed forces, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, hardly has the air of a man who is cornered and is seeking a way out of his problems. Since the United Nations force was ordered to leave, he has become more visible and more expansive.
 
Conditions for Any Departure
 In two rare interviews with the foreign press this week, he said he planned to step down as commander-in-chief of the Haitian armed forces when his three-year term expires on Jan. 31, 1995, and would be willing to leave earlier only if other nations recognized Haiti's army-installed president, Emile Jonassaint.
"I think they still believe the United States is not going to invade, that it's all a bluff," a Haitian businessman with military ties said.
Backers of the military point to a statement by Senators Bob Dole and Sam Nunn and by others in Congress that Haiti is not of vital interest to the United States. "There are divisions in the military here, but there are also divisions in Washington," said the Haitian businessman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Supporters of the military have also taken comfort in contradictory pronouncements by Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and in his clashes with his backers in Washington.
The deposed President has the habit of "spitting in the rice," a Government official said, using a Haitian expression that describes an action intended to deliberately spoil a relationship, and has alienated many of his American sponsors.
Haiti's Information Ministry declined to comment today on a speech by Father Aristide that was broadcast to Haitians on Friday night via a new radio station set up for him by the United States.
Radio reception of the speech was weak in many sections of Port-au-Prince, making it hard for supporters in poor districts to hear the exiled President's message. Still, Gerard Joseph, an unemployed handyman, said he liked what he heard, "especially the promise to build schools and create jobs, because that is what we really need."
There are some signs that the economic sanctions against Haiti, including a freeze on Haitian assets imposed recently by the United States, are beginning to have an impact.
Employees at some Government ministries have complained that their paychecks are arriving late or, in some instances, not at all. In an action intended to enable the Government to meet those and other financial obligations, the Haitian Senate approved a proposal this week to eliminate a ceiling on the amount of money in circulation.
 
Bracing for Inflation
 An opposition member of the National Assembly called the measure, whose legality has been questioned but which was eagerly and immediately welcomed by Government officials, a "design by the coup makers to squander the coffers of the state before they pack their bags." But the main consequence of the flood of crisp new bills that are expected to begin appearing any day now will be to accelerate inflation.
With foreign trade blocked because of the United Nations embargo and large areas of domestic commerce crippled or driven underground, Mr. Jonassaint's de facto administration indeed has fewer and fewer sources of revenue. Desperate for hard currency, the Government has taken to charging the few foreigners arriving here $50 apiece to enter the country.
The military and its civilian allies are responding to the mounting economic pressure by invoking Haitian nationalism, always a potent force. A rally called on Thursday to protest the embargo was held under a statue of Henri Christophe, the President and king who committed suicide in 1820 after he lost control of his army.
The streets of the capital are festooned with banners proclaiming "Occupation, Invasion, Death: No!" or simply "No!" During broadcasts of World Cup soccer matches, slogans like "Haiti is small but won't be trampled!" or "No to occupation!" appeared on the screen.
Whether such appeals are finding their mark is an open question. Barely 1,000 people turned out for the Government-endorsed protest against the embargo, and many of them seemed more interested in the free T-shirts, food and rum drinks being distributed by organizers than in the speeches lambasting the United States and its allies.

HEADLINE: Amid Uncertainty, Exploring Options for the Coliseum

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Over the nine years of Mortimer B. Zuckerman's effort to develop the site of the New York Coliseum, prospective tenants and partners came and went, plans were drawn and revised, the site itself was scaled back and the developer's down payment was reduced. One constant, at least in recent months, was acrimony.
Yesterday was no different. On the morning after the transaction unraveled, all sides were still insisting that their honest intent was to see a project go forward while charging one other with negotiating in bad faith. 
 "We were outraged at the actions of the M.T.A., which have prevented us from going forward," a statement by Mr. Zuckerman began.
Peter E. Stangl, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said any implication that the agency had tried to spoil the deal was "garbage."
The deal involved ambitious plans for one of New York's prime sites, at Columbus Circle, yet in the end the parties were quibbling over issues as mundane as parking spaces.
 
City Has Down Payment
 For the transportation authority, which owns the site, the collapse of the negotiations with Mr. Zuckerman offers a chance to start anew on a development plan.
The city, which sought the project for the jobs it was expected to produce, instead has Mr. Zuckerman's $17 million nonrefundable down payment, which will eventually be transferred to the M.T.A.'s capital budget for transit system improvements. And thanks to an agreement made by former Mayor David N. Dinkins in the final days of his administration, the city will have a equal say with the M.T.A. in any future development project at the Coliseum.
As for Mr. Zuckerman and his partner, Edward H. Linde, they are contemplating a lawsuit to recover either their money or their right to build at the Coliseum. But Mr. Linde did not completely rule out the possibility that if the Coliseum site were put on the market again, he and Mr. Zuckerman would be among the bidders.
The $17 million that Mr. Zuckerman has forfeited is only half what he stood to lose six weeks ago, when the terms were most recently revised and the project seemingly put back on track.
Until June, Mr. Zuckerman was under a 1989 contract with the M.T.A. to pay $338 million to develop the entire 3.4 acre Coliseum property. He stood to lose $33.8 million in a line of credit if he walked away from that deal.
 
Price Was Talked Down
 For months Mr. Zuckerman tried to negotiate a lower price, arguing that the decline in the real-estate market made developing the entire site in a single project too risky. In June the M.T.A. agreed to split the site in half and reduced its price to $100 million. With an agreement specified in a letter of intent, the parties tried to write a new contract.
There was one aspect of the failed negotiations on which all parties could agree: When the talks broke down hours before a Friday midnight deadline for a signing of the contract, several crucial issues remained unresolved.
"This was a very complex deal," said Robert Bergen, counsel for the transportation authority, "but it could have been done. But in the end we were not close."
 
Final Deal-Crusher
 Still unresolved were matters large and small, Mr. Bergen and others said. They included the division of the property; conditions for the separation of the Coliseum exhibition hall, which was to be demolished, from an office building, which was to remain in use; the number of parking spaces that could be created in the garage that the developer and the M.T.A. were to share, and who would be responsible for seeking the necessary approvals for additional spaces.
Another issue, which may have been the final deal-crusher, involved the personal liability of Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Linde.
"We expected a guarantee of their responsibility for certain risks that we felt were well within the boundaries of the letter of intent," said Mr. Bergen.
For example, Mr. Bergen asked, who would be responsible if during demolition work a system in the office building, like air conditioning, failed? Who would pay the cost of relocating tenants?
"It would not be responsible as a public entity for us to take that risk," said Mr. Bergen. "If the development company lacks adequate assets to cover those risks, then the partners should assume the risk."
 
Personal Guarantees
 In the developer's view, such assurances sought by the M.T.A. were not consistent with the agreement.
"After paying $17 million in cash," said Mr. Linde, "we were being asked to pay an additional $63 million for the site and put up personal guarantees or letters of credit that would amount to more than $100 million. Anyone in the business world would tell you that those demands were overreaching the letter of intent."
Yesterday Mr. Stangl said the M.T.A. would join with the city to decide the best use for the Coliseum.
"The Coliseum is a very important site in terms of its location and potential," said Mr. Stangl. "It is appropriate now for us to look at all of the options whether that is an interim use of some sort or another development project."
When asked if Mr. Zuckerman might be among those bidding on a new development plan, Mr. Linde, his partner, said that the site's potential still appealed to them.
 
Loss of Appetite for Deal
 "We still think the Coliseum property presents an extraordinary opportunity," said Mr. Linde. "I did not spend the last 10 years of my life beating my head against a brick wall for a project we don't want do do. We would love to be involved in the future of the Coliseum. But unless there is a dramatic change in the leadership or methods at the M.T.A., it is highly unlikely."
While John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, blamed the M.T.A. for the negotiations' failure, he seemed to have no appetite for trying to revive the deal.
Once a letter of intent was signed on June 2 outlining what was to be signed on Friday, he said, it should have been easy to translate the agreement into a contract.
"Normally it's an administrative thing to do," said Mr. Dyson.
 
Determining the Future
 Mr. Dyson said lawyers for the city did not think that the personal guarantees the the M.T.A. was seeking were necessary.
"It's preposterous to expect men like them to guarantee anything with their personal fortunes," he said.
Mr. Dyson said that while he was disappointed, he believed the city was now in a better position to determine the future of the Coliseum site.
"You are better off taking $17 million in hard cold cash right now," he said. "On our side of the calculation, we could have lost the suit," he added, referring to the lawsuit that Mr. Zuckerman filed last May charging that his previous contract to build on the Coliseum property was not valid.
 
'Trying to Keep It Alive'
 Mr. Stangl insisted that the transportation authority had done everything it could to conclude a deal.
"I don't know how many times we have renegotiated this deal," he said, "and it has always been because we were trying to keep it alive and to get the project done."
Mr. Stangl said that when the agency agreed in June to a plan for Mr. Zuckerman to buy only half the site, at a reduced price, it had showed its good intentions to the developer and to the city.

HEADLINE: State Senator, A Democrat, Is Nominated For Governor

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 16

 BODY:
The president of the Connecticut Senate, John M. Larson, easily won the Democratic nomination for Governor at the party's state convention today but now faces a primary challenge from state Comptroller William E. Curry Jr., who won 35 percent of the delegates' votes.
Mr. Larson, a Senator from East Hartford since 1983, who was strongly supported by the party's leadership, said his economic plan to put Connecticut residents back to work and his ability to raise campaign funds would carry the party to victory in November. He won 65 percent of the votes. 
 "Of course we'd like to see party unity," said Mr. Larson. "Obviously we'd like to avoid a primary. If there is one, I'm confident we'll prevail."
After his nomination, Mr. Larson and party leaders immediately turned to the choice of a nominee for lieutenant governor, hoping to form a strong enough ticket to dissuade Mr. Curry from pursuing a primary. But hours later, just as Mr. Larson was deciding on the mayor of Bridgeport, Joseph Ganim, as his running mate, Mr. Curry emerged from his headquarters and announced that the primary was on.
 
Can't Wait
 "I thought long and hard today about the interests and well-being of the Democratic Party," Mr. Curry told a cheering crowd. "But even more I thought long and hard about the interests and well-being of this state."
"Because our cities cannot wait four more years," he said, "because the economy of this state needs to be turned around now, and not four or eight years from now, because our communities are not safe, because our children's lives depend so much on our bravery, I've decided to ask all of you to take a risk."
The primary will be held Sept. 13
Soon after Mr. Curry's announcement, Mr. Ganim was nominated for lieutenant governor and was approved by a quick voice vote called by the convention chairman, state Rep. Thomas Ritter of Hartford. "No's" and boos competed with the "yeah's."
 
Looking for Comeback
 Up to that point, unity was the overriding theme of this convention, as Democrats, the state's dominant party for 40 years, looked forward to recapturing the Governor's office after losing it to Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an independent, in 1990. Governor Weicker is not running for re-election.
The party faces a strong challenge in November from the expected Republican nominee, John Rowland, a former Congressman who outpolled the Democrats four years ago. And Eunice S. Groark, Mr. Weicker's lieutenant governor, is running for Governor on the A Connecticut Party ticket, again making it a three-way race.
But Mr. Curry, 42, a member of the Democrats' progressive wing, had said from the beginning that his goal was to qualify for a primary, and little changed immediately today even after a third candidate, state Sen. Richard Balducci, withdrew and most of his delegates went to Mr. Larson.
Mr. Larson, 45, overwhelmingly captured the state's cities, where the party organization is strongest. But Mr. Curry received 510 votes, or 35 percent of the convention total, mostly from suburbs and small towns.
The Democrats nominated United States Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman for a second term by acclamation Friday night, assuring the ticket of one popular candidate.
 
Blumenthal Named
 Today, as negotiations were under way over the nomination for lieutenant governor -- more important perhaps to the party, to satisfy various ethnic and personal interests, than to voters -- a second popular Democrat, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, was nominated for a second term.
The negotiations intensified this morning when Mr. Balducci withdrew just before the nominating speeches were to begin and called for party unity.
Courted by the other candidates to be their lieutenant governor, Mr. Balducci had come under heavy pressure from party leaders to accept that post as his support began eroding below the 15 percent of delegates needed to qualify for a primary.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE CAMPAIGN;
Using TV to Create Skewed Window on Nation

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Seldom have so many frowned so earnestly. Day after day here, to the accompaniment of tolling bells and morose soap opera music, typical Americans drive along small-town streets, gather in kitchens, offices and hospitals, knit their brows and fret over what Congress is going to do about health care.
These television images could be in Akron, Miami or Duluth. But the commercials that contain them are not. 
 They are intended not to move national opinion, but to change what Congress thinks that opinion is. So most are being televised in Washington, although some are being aired in Congressional districts with swing votes or on CNN.
And each day there are more.
On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee released new advertisements, attacking Republican recalcitrance, scheduled to run in Washington but also in Wisconsin, Nebraska and Nevada, where the committee thinks Democratic Senators need to be pulled into the President's camp. But the effort backfired, prompting Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, to complain that the advertisement was excessively partisan on an issue that will need bipartisan support.
 
At a Fraction of the Cost
 On Friday, the Health Care Reform Project, a coalition of unions and other groups that would require employers to help pay for insurance, released an advertisement intended for the Washington market that contained its toughest message yet. It charged that Pizza Hut helped pay for workers' health benefits in Germany and Japan but is lobbying hard to block the same coverage for Americans. Blocked from television stations after Pizza Hut executives called the advertisement libelous, the group now plans to get the message out in advertisements in The Washington Post and The New York Times.
The tempest is almost exclusively confined to Washington. The Democratic Party's "advertising blitz" costs only $400,000, a fraction of what a national media campaign might, and is designed to swing the nation's capital, not the nation.
"Washington is absolutely freaked out about ads that most people don't even know are out there," said Drew E. Altman, the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a private philanthropy that has both studied the health care advertising and contributed to the outpouring with its own commercials. "The policy makers turn on their TV's and they say, America is seeing this!"
Probably not. Although special interest groups, political parties and the health care industry have already spent at least $25 million to buy television, radio and newspaper advertising, most purchases have actually been small, tightly focused and relatively cheap. The most effective among them, like the "Harry and Louise" advertisement produced by the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group, make news by either provoking a response from the White House or, in the case of the Democrats' advertisements, taking such an outrageous tone that news organizations cannot resist reporting on them.
 
Advertisements in News
 The $12 million Harry and Louise campaign ran in more markets than most of the advertisements reach. But an analysis done by the Kaiser Foundation showed that more people knew of that relatively expensive campaign through news accounts than from seeing the advertisement itself.
When the Democratic National Committee released a sardonic spoof showing their own Harry and Louise lying in bed in body casts and complaining about being out of work and out of insurance, almost every major news organization reported the advertisement. The Democratic committee spent only $250,000 to air the spot, but the news coverage reached a nationwide audience.
This strategy is being pursued by both sides. The Republican National Committee last March began a $500,000 campaign in Washington and Congressional districts in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Omaha, Providence, R.I., and elsewhere where it ran with a tag line naming local Congressmen and urging viewers to call them.
Haley Barbour, the Republican chairman, said he decided to run the advertisement after discovering that the public thought Republicans opposed change of any kind. "We did not intend to enter the debate with a multimillion-dollar media campaign," he said. "But we did not want people to be misled into thinking their choice was either Clinton's health care reform or doing nothing." The districts chosen to receive it each represented a critical vote either of a fence-straddling legislator or members of the subcommittees that were moving bills through the system.
 
Mild and Pointed Appeals
 The Republican advertisements, like many early ones, were relatively mild, though vaguely filled with threats. Other groups have made more pointed appeals. "We go to very elementary messages," said Brent N. Bahler, the director of communications for the Citizens for a Sound Economy, a conservative political group that opposes expanded government initiatives. "Television is not really equipped to advance the debate," he said. "And yet it is actually easier to advertise around an issue than around a candidate because the candidate's ego is not involved."
Mr. Bahler's group has focused on fears that a national health insurance plan would mean red tape, arbitrary assignment of doctors, tax increases, long lines and, ultimately, health care rationing.
Supporters of revamping the health care system have a broad array of messages, too. The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League aired one advertisement that took on a wide variety of women's health concerns from contraception to breast cancer and, of course, abortion rights.
"The key for us was defining our message early on," said James Wagoner, the group's executive vice president. "We have wanted to be sure that women aren't discriminated against by some plan that takes away care women already receive." The group's advertisement ran during CNN's morning news shows.
 
Conflicting Messages
 Robert A. Chlopak, a public policy communications expert working for the Health Care Reform Project, a consortium of 47 organizations supporting national health insurance, said that group's $4 million advertising campaign has refined its message at each step of the debate.
As the debate nears the floor, the group has developed the Pizza Hut advertisement and constantly hit away at the theme that the men and women of Congress may have better health coverage than average Americans.
The result for general viewers is a welter of conflicting messages. Those non-politicians who do catch the advertisements, either on CNN or on their local television stations, are faced with a wild array of conflicting messages and only the barest whiff of actual information. "People are incredibly confused and frustrated and cynical about what is happening in health care reform," said Mr. Altman, of the Kaiser Foundation. "And because of that they are throwing their hands up in despair, having no idea what is the truth any more."
 
Perception vs. Fact
 Mr. Bahler, too, acknowledges a cumulative danger. "We all come at it with different interests and different messages," he said. "What we end up with is an attack on a dozen or more fronts, not just all coming up over one cliff. And that makes it particularly dangerous."
It also, of course, leaves the debate right back where it began -- in the hands of the politicians, the spin doctors and the special interest groups. But there is a twist. Instead of just working in the bubble of the capital, legislators now work in the bubble with the perception that they know what is going on outside it.
That perception was particularly strong when the Health Insurance Association of America ran its first "Harry and Louise" advertisements. "Everyone on the Hill was convinced that H.I.A.A. was this hugely powerful juggernaut that had its hand on the pulse of America," Mr. Altman said.
That frightened a lot of politicians. And that, of course, was brilliant strategy.


GRAPHIC: Though most people around the country see few of them, advertisements for and against national health insurance have been filling the airwaves of Washington -- and selected states and Congressional districts -- as interest groups seek to mold opinion on Capitol Hill and convert fence-sitters in Congress. One of the hottest topics is whether a health care plan should be designed to cover every American. President Clinton says he will veto any legislation that does not include such universal coverage.
 
PRO: The American Association of Retired Persons.
Chart: "TRANSCRIPTS: Overhauling Health Care: Two Campaigns"
ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with a black screen with the words "One Family's Story," then shows a kitchen scene where a husband and wife and an older woman are sitting at a table, while a young teenager walks in the background.
TELEVISION SCRIPT -- Husband: I've been trying to get a better job for years, but I have a heart condition. Other companies' health plans won't touch me.
Wife: Well, yeah, I feel lucky, in a way. Compared to Phil and Amy. He's been laid off for seven months now. She's pregnant. They don't have any insurance.
Words appear on the screen: "Every Family Is at Risk."
Announcer: This is so messed up. Every family is at risk of losing health benefits. Tell your members of Congress, "Keep universal coverage in health care reform. Our families need it.
SCORECARD -- Because the actors are convincing and the concerns they articulate are common, the advertisement hits home. But it does not address the biggest question about universal coverage: how will we pay for it? As a result, it may preach more effectively to those already converted to the cause of national insurance than to those who oppose such a sweeping step.
WHERE IT IS SHOWN -- On CNN and in the Washington area.
 
CON: Citizens for a Sound Economy
ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with a view of the White House, then shifts to show bureaucrats, people on an unemployment line, doctors performing surgery and other scenes as the announcer speaks.
TELEVISION SCRIPT -- Announcer: A lot of politicians promise health reform. What would it mean to you and your family? What most politicans are proposing would mean a big bureaucracy. Tax increases. Loss of jobs. Waiting lines. Limiting your right to choose doctors. Rationed medical care. Sme politicians want to force this on you and your family. They say it's the price we must pay for so-called universal coverage. Mandated universal coverage--fancy words for what is really government controlled medical care. Are you willing to risk your future on it? Why not then just fix only what's wrong with the system? There are, after all, many good ideas to help those who need help without resorting to a big government takeover.
SCORECARD -- While the ad plays effectively on many peoples' fears, its Darth Vader tone works against it. It has an overblown quality that slips dangerously close to the tone of a spoof. But it closes on a strong point, appealing to viewers' pragmatism with a warning that Congress should just fix what is broken in the health care system instead of embarking on a top-to-bottom overhaul.
WHERE IT IS SHOWN -- Washington and selected states and districts. In Louisiana, for example, the advertisement ends by urging viewers to call Senator John B. Breaux, a Southern moderate who has at different times opposed or supported requiring employers to provide insurance for their workers. The ad urges viewers to "tell him that mandated universal coverage is not a universal cure -- and he should vote against it." The Senator's name and telephone number appear on the screen.

HEADLINE: WORLD CUP '94;
Two Stars Share Brilliance And Little Else

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORRANCE, Calif., July 16

 BODY:
Player by player, the coach announced Italy's lineup in a hushed hotel ballroom this morning, but all the names were superfluous except for one. Roberto Baggio. A few days ago, his name meant emotional rescue in the World Cup. Now it was a gloomy password, signifying injury and uncertainty.
"There is still some question mark," Coach Arrigo Sacchi said, referring to Baggio's strained hamstring. "We will try in practice today and we will make a final decision tomorrow." 
 Tentatively, Baggio has been placed in the starting lineup for Sunday's World Cup final. Perhaps Sacchi will save him for the second half, knowing that Brazil has seldom scored in the first.
In any case, all the world -- save perhaps Brazil's defense -- hopes he can play. For it is Baggio and Romario of Brazil who have defined this tournament with their personalities, keen sense of drama and potent ability to score.
Romario is a cunning genius, Baggio a tortured savior. Their teams rely on them the way the Chicago Bulls depended on Michael Jordan. With them, anything is possible. Without them, victory seems remote, unattainable.
"If Brazil wins the final, Romario will be the player of the World Cup," said the former French star Michel Platini. "If Italy wins, it will be Baggio."
Their unrivaled success in the tournament has elicited wild devotion, throbbing national passion and the purplest of prose. At a hotel restaurant near Los Angeles International Airport the other night, a table of several dozen Brazilian fans broke into loud, rhythmic cheers of "Romario, Romario" at regular intervals. After his two goals provided Italy's 2-1 semifinal victory over Bulgaria, Baggio was pictured in a Milan newspaper surrounded by a penumbra of soccer balls and deified with the headline: "St. Baggio from N.Y."
"Baggianism," wrote Curzio Ma in La Stampa, a Turin newspaper, is "the only faith which unites Italians in the world."
Not to be outdone, Fernando Calazans of Rio's O Globo newspaper wrote that Romario "seems touched by the aura of champions. Blessed the breeze that blows in favor of Romario; it takes us, sweetly levitating, to the finals of the World Cup."
What the players have in common is transcendence in the same profession and little else. Where Baggio, who is 27, is humble, Romario, who is 28, is audacious. Where Baggio married quietly and took a villa next to his parents, Romario married on the penalty spot of a soccer stadium before a live television audience.
Where Baggio posed this spring for two friends who drove 125 miles to take his picture, Romario called a news conference to announce that he would not sit next to Bebeto on the team charter. When Pele said Romario should leave coaching to the coaches, Romario labeled him a "museum piece" and called him "mentally retarded." He believes there is a necessary egotism and selfishness to his job of scoring goals.
"I know I am a difficult guy," Romario said before the World Cup. "It's because I'm the real thing."
Both Romario and Baggio have scored five goals in the World Cup, but comparisons between them are necessarily awkward. They play different positions, employing contrasting styles. Romario is a pure striker, "king of the penalty area," as his coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, calls him; Baggio is neither a pure forward or a midfielder but a hybrid called a withdrawn forward.
Romario has roamed to midfield during this tournament, but his singular skill is to root himself patiently in the penalty area, appearing inert and inattentive, then pouncing on any opportunity to score. He plays straight-ahead, bulling his way toward the goal with a muscular dribble and deceiving speed in short bursts. If this were American football, he would be a fullback brought in to punch the ball across the goal line.
"Romario is a specialist, not a player to compare to others who fight to get the ball, who run and move," said Pele, the greatest Brazilian player of them all. "When he gets the ball, he's very dangerous. He can give the pass if there is no space or he can make space for himself. He's quick with the ball. No doubt he's the best striker today in the World Cup."
Romario is squat and sturdy, Baggio is short and fragile. Baggio wears a braided ponytail and is known as Il Divino Codino, the divine pigtail. He is more of a playmaker than Romario and has an acute radar for placing shots into the net from impossible angles. His 60-yard bob-and-weave against Czechoslovakia was the most attractive goal of the 1990 World Cup.
"He's able to dribble through 11 players and score," said his teammate Antonio Conte.
 
Italian Player, Latin Style
 An indifferent student, Baggio said in an interview before the World Cup that as a kid he dreamed of scoring the winning goal in the 90th minute of the World Cup final. Today he may get his wish.
"Baggio is the only player in Italy who has the Latin style," Pele said, referring to his flair. "This is the player Carlos Parreira had better play very smart against. He can change a game in one second."
Baggio's World Cup, like his career, has been a real-life version of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. Knee injuries cost him two seasons, bringing doubt and introspection; eventually, Baggio converted from Catholicism to Buddhism. He was benched for the start of the semifinals in the 1990 World Cup, which Italy lost in a penalty-kick shootout to Argentina. He played limply early in this tournament, was yanked from the Norway game for strategic reasons and was later called a "wet rabbit" by Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat car magnate who operates the Juventus club team for which Baggio plays in the Italian League.
"The criticism didn't bother him," said his teammate Nicola Berti. "Playing in the Italian League, you're used to being criticized every day."
By the round of 16, Baggio had returned to form. Italy was a minute from exiting when he tied Nigeria then won the game in overtime. Against Spain in the quarterfinals, he delivered the winning goal in the 88th minute. Against Bulgaria in the semifinals, Baggio produced two early goals before limping off with a balky hamstring.
Afterward, Baggio cried and said in operatic style, "This is my life; it is made of sweat and tears."
Romario has proceeded with less melodrama and more of a sense of inevitability. He has forecast that this would be "Romario's World Cup" with a seemingly bold accuracy. More than Baggio, Romario seems to have an undiluted sense of his place in his country's history, where success in soccer is a bandage that covers deep political and economic wounds. This week, he announced that he was starting a soccer school for children.
"We are aware that socially, politically, economically, Brazil is in bad shape," Romario said this week. "If we get out of here champions of the world, many things will be left behind. Soccer will take center stage. But these problems have to be solved. We've gone 24 years without winning, so we need to celebrate, but one week, two weeks later, we've got to end that and start living Brazil's life. The poor children have to be looked at. We can't forget about that."

HEADLINE: Look Again at Taiwan

 BODY:
If buying $8 billion worth of American products entitles China to flout President Clinton's human rights requirements and still win renewal of its trade privileges, buying twice that amount should entitle Taiwan to a little diplomatic respect.
Taiwan has one of Asia's most developed economies, best armed militaries and most vibrant democracies. Yet Taiwan's President is not allowed to stay overnight on American soil, Taiwanese officials are not allowed to meet their U.S. counterparts in government buildings and Taiwan's diplomatic offices in this country cannot use any name that would identify the country they represent. 
 This charade reflects the long-held position of both Taipei and Beijing that there is only one China and that it includes both the mainland and Taiwan. Washington abided by this fiction both before and after it switched U.S. recognition from Nationalist Taiwan to the Communist mainland in 1979.
But in reality two distinct societies, economies and political systems have grown up on either side of the Taiwan Straits. And despite its official "one China policy," Taipei now seeks diplomatic recognition as a separate political entity.
That has prompted the Clinton Administration to undertake a cautious review of U.S. policy. The resulting recommendations await White House approval. They would ease some of the more humiliating diplomatic restrictions now in force. Cabinet-level visits in both directions would be permitted. Meetings could take place on official premises. Taiwan's unofficial representative offices could be renamed. These are useful steps, meant to make it easier for Americans to do business with the country's fifth-largest trading partner.
But recognizing reality should not stop there. Taiwan is too important a factor in East Asian politics, economics and security to be left out of the new post-cold war order now taking shape. It belongs in the new World Trade Organization. It ought to be included in the Asean Regional Forum on security being launched in Bangkok later this month. And ideally, it should be admitted to the U.N.
The main obstacle to Taiwan's inclusion in such organizations is the bellicose opposition of mainland China, which openly asserts the right to invade and annex Taiwan if the Government there acts too independently. Beijing claims that its relations with Taiwan are an internal matter to be resolved by the two sides alone without outside involvement.
It is not in America's interest to provoke China on this score. But shutting Taiwan out of international forums also carries risks for the U.S. Under present arrangements, if China made good on its threats to attack, other Asian countries would look the other way while the United States, alone, would find itself caught in the middle of the fray.
Last year, Washington helped arrange a compromise formula that let Taiwan participate in the Asia-Pacific economic summit meetings in Seattle. Now it should begin exploring ways to involve Taiwan in the new regional security forum as well.
