HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Rise in Slow Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds rose again and interest rates dipped further in sluggish trading yesterday. Prices were pushed higher by rumors late in the session that a weekly report on initial unemployment claims would rise to a record high.
The weekly claims numbers, which are released on Thursdays by the Labor Department, are considered a good indicator of employment trends. 
 The rumors were about the only highlight in an otherwise lackluster session.
 
'Holding Together Quite Well'
 "Things might seem dull, but considering the move we have had over the last week or so the market is holding together quite well," one government bond trader said.
Another trader said: "The market is vulnerable to bad news, particularly if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf. But if we don't get that sort of news, we will probably keep going."
The rally in the Government securities market and the sharp drop in interest rates proved beneficial to New York City, which yesterday sold a record $1.17 billion worth of taxable and tax-exempt securities.
Investment bankers involved in the deal said the securities, which carried a maximum tax-exempt yield of 8.55 percent on bonds maturing from 2011 to 2017, were well received by institutional and retail investors.
"The issue got a lot of support," said Kenneth J. McAlley, a senior vice president at the United States Trust Company. "The city has to be encouraged."
A major reason the auction was well received was that the risk associated with New York City issues has meant that yields on those securities are about a full percentage point higher than on other comparably rated securities. Although the higher yield attracts investors, it also translates into higher costs for the city.
 
Long Bond Gains 6/32
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the late rumors on the unemployment claims helped to push the price of the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 to 107 26/32 late yesterday, up 6/32, to yield 8.05 percent, compared with 8.06 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 1/8 in late trading, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.80 percent. And the price of the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes rose by 2/32, to 100 10/32, to yield 7.19 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.77 percent, down 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell 5 basis points, to a late-offered rate of 6.65 percent. Rates on one-year bills fell by a similar amount, to a late-offered rate of 6.57 percent.
Although many market participants remain optimistic that bond yields can fall further, some money managers are now saying that the bulk of the move may be over.
"We think we are nearing the low end of the range for long-term bond yields," said Marshall B. Front, an executive vice president at Stein, Roe & Farnham, a Chicago-based firm with close to $10 billion in fixed-income investments. "Bond yields could fall another 25 basis points or so, but that is about it."
Mr. Front is much more optimistic about short-term rates and is advising clients to buy intermediate-term issues rather than bonds now.
"If clients have significant cash positions, I would advise them to move into the three-year-to-five-year area," he said. "With the economy doing poorly and the Fed responding to that weakness, I would not be surprised to see another full percentage point drop in short rates over the next six months."
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 to 1/4 point.
New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market cooled yesterday after a torrid few days. Despite the huge increase in new supply, prices in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds rose by about 1/8 point, dealers reported.

HEADLINE: Hard Times? Not for These Stores

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12

 BODY:
They conduct a no-frills business in cavernous warehouses on the outskirts of towns, shun advertising and limit access to those with memberships. But by offering a wide variety of goods at wholesale prices, membership warehouse clubs have quietly and firmly positioned themselves as a rare bright spot in the nation's dim retailing environment.
Moreover, in an economy certain to encourage even more bargain hunting by consumers and businesses alike, the huge stores that carry everything from mayonnaise to mattresses are expected to outperform mainstream retailers by a wide margin in the next several years. 
 Even analysts who are pessimistic generally about retailers' fortunes use words like "mindboggling" and "barn burner" to describe the $22 billion industry's sales growth prospects.
"I can't think of another retail format that has the possibility of a 20 to 25 percent growth rate for the next four to five years," said Sarah Stack, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.
With names like the Price Club and Sam's Club, the warehouses act primarily as wholesalers, selling food, office supplies and other necessities to businesses at prices typically 8 percent above cost from the manufacturer. Business owners can also buy goods for their private use. In addition many individuals can buy annual memberships at $25 to $30. Membership is most often extended to those who are health-care and government workers or in other employee groups with stable incomes.
It seems odd that any store selling basic goods would limit the number of people who can shop, even in such a broad way. But industry executives say that to maintain their wholesale selling approach they try to insure that 60 to 65 percent of their customers are business owners.
And by limiting consumer memberships the clubs have created a successful balance of businesses that buy frequently and in large quantities and a steady stream of individuals who are likely to visit often. Membership also makes customers feel they are getting a good deal not available to everyone.
On weekends, people jam the aisles prowling for huge jars of peanut butter, 12-packs of English muffins, telephone answering machines, tires and dictionaries.
"The business customers are very important for us," said James D. Sinegal, president of the Costco Wholesale Corporation, based in Kirkland, Wash. "That's why we're as restrictive as we are. We don't want to drive those customers away."
Competition started heating up in the mid-1980's and now four companies account for about 85 percent of industry sales. The companies and their estimated 1990 sales are: Wal-Mart, which operates Sam's ($6.5 billion); the Price Company, which operates the Price Club, ($5.6 billion); Costco, which operates the Costco Wholesale Club ($4.3 billion), and the K Mart Corporation, which operates the Pace Membership Warehouse ($2.6 billion).
There are about 400 warehouses in the United States and Canada, according to Salomon Brothers, and expansion of the stores should continue at a rate of 10 percent to 15 percent annually through 1995.
 
Imitators Moving In
 Success is inspiring imitators who have set up smaller specialty warehouse-type companies that focus on specific categories. Some, for example, are offering wholesale prices on office supplies or auto parts.
Jack D. Seibald, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in New York, estimates that the warehouse club industry, which had sales of $17.8 billion last year, will grow 24 percent this year, to $22.1 billion. Within five years, Mr. Seibald estimates, the industry could top $50 billion in sales.
Profits, which are derived from both product sales and the $25 to $30 annual membership fees charged to businesses and individuals, should also climb as the industry, which is only 14 years old, grows.
Daniel D. Barry, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company, said the growing attraction of the membership club concept was simple to understand. "It's a wholesale business serving the business person with prices that are cheaper than anywhere else, particularly cheaper than distributors charge," he said.
The analysts said their expectations for the clubs remained high even if the nation fell into any but the worst recession. About 60 to 65 percent of club members are small-business owners who, regardless of economic conditions, must stock their vending machines with candy and cigarettes, buy paper for fax machines and replace old cash registers.
"In an economic slowdown some small businesses, which in the past opted to have products delivered to their door, may decide to pick up the same products at a lower price at a membership warehouse," Bo Cheadle, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, wrote in a report on the industry.
The industry received a strong vote of confidence in November when Sam's agreed to acquire the Wholesale Club Inc., a smaller competitor based in Indianapolis, for $178 million. Sam's was already the largest chain in the industry, with 147 stores in 28 states.
On the same day, the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, parent of the A.& P. supermarket chain, said it would enter the business by buying control of Warehouse Club Inc. of Chicago.
Among the smaller companies is Waban Inc. of Natick, Mass., which runs BJ's Wholesale Club, with estimated 1990 sales of $1.2 billion. But analysts expect several companies to be squeezed out or to merge with one of the big four, which have the strongest financing and can expand faster.
 
'Enormous Potential'
 Mr. Seibald of Salomon Brothers said the two deals were indicative of the "enormous potential" in the warehouse format.
But Robert Price, the chairman of the San Diego-based Price Club, whose father, Sol, invented the concept in 1976, is less sanguine.
"We supply to hotels and offices and restaurants, and to the extent there is any kind of slowdown in the economy that will ripple back," to his company, he said.
In some areas, like Los Angeles and Maple Shade, N.J., near Philadelphia, several warehouse companies already compete. But in many areas of the country there is room for growth. All the large chains have plans to build new warehouses, which often become hits from opening day. When Sam's built a warehouse in Fargo, N.D., recently, it immediately sold close to 5,000 business memberships.
 
Efficiency Stressed
 The membership clubs' success depends a great deal on efficiency, because of their slim markups of 8 to 10 percent, compared with 40 percent at many discount stores and 65 percent and more at higher-priced department stores. The warehouses must cut costs wherever possible.
That is why the stores are placed in industrial sites, where real estate is cheaper, and why they seldom pay for advertising, relying instead on word-of-mouth to find members.
The hangar-sized buildings typically consist of 100,000 to 130,000 square feet, compared with 70,000 square feet for the average K Mart. The floors are concrete and sales help is practically nonexistent. Merchandise remains on the pallets on which it arrived from manufacturers.
 
5-Gallon Jars of Mayonnaise
 To keep the warehouses running efficiently and to promote quick sellouts, operators typically stock only about 3,500 products, compared with more than 25,000 in the typical supermarket. That means only one or a few brands of each product are carried, usually in one large size, like five-gallon jars of mayonnaise and packages of five dozen eggs. The bigger sizes are a better deal for those who need or can use them, like restaurant operators.
But even minding the shop closely yields slim profits. In fact, at BJ's Wholesale Club the average 8 percent markup is too thin to make a profit, said T. J. Matheny, vice president of marketing. The company earns its money on the $25 membership fees.
The same is true at Wal-Mart's Sam's units. Stores like Sam's can sign up 5,000 to 10,000 businesses and 25,000 individual consumers as members, said Brenda Lockhart, a Sam's spokeswoman. At an average $25 yearly membership fee, that adds up to $750,000 to $1 million in annual profits per warehouse.
The Price Club, which earned $125.4 million on sales of $5.4 billion in the fiscal year 1990, and usually posts a pretax margin of 3.5 to 4 percent, is generally given credit for being the operator with the highest profit margins.
Analysts point to Costco, which earned $49.2 million on sales of $4.1 billion in 1990, as the fastest-growing chain and the one doing the most creative merchandising. Costco is given credit for introducing fresh fish, fruit and vegetables.
Now other chains even have special offers like cars for sale at fleet prices. and one recently had a grand piano prominently displayed -- and for sale.

HEADLINE: TREASURY HELPING NEW ENGLAND BANK WITH BIG DEPOSITS

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has been quietly shoring up the troubled Bank of New England, placing more than $1 billion of public money in the Boston bank after billions were withdrawn by depositors who were worried about the institution's rising losses from bad loans.
The Treasury Department routinely deposits in commercial banks Federal funds from personal and corporate taxes as well as operating cash. Hundreds of financial institutions act as Federal depositories through these "tax and loan accounts," which the Treasury says are "blindly" placed. 
 But the Bank of New England case appears to be the first instance in which the Comptroller of the Currency, the arm of the Treasury that regulates most large banks, has approved using funds in these accounts to help a bank improve its cash position.
 
Critics Talk of Risk
 The case has raised questions among legislators and financial experts about the safety of the procedures of the Government for investing public money and about its role in aiding troubled financial institutions.
These critics say the action is risky. Because the Federal money is uninsured, the Government could be exposed to losses if the bank failed. A senior Treasury official said all loans to depositories were safe because they were protected by adequate collateral, which could be liquidated in the event of a failure. But some experts have questioned the Treasury's methods for valuing collateral. The methods are subject to little outside oversight and are less conservative than those used by the private credit markets and by a number of state treasuries.
"Treasury should behave as prudently as any other investor, and if it takes on increased risk by investing in a problem bank, then its investment should be more openly disclosed and debated," said James Barth, a professor of finance at Auburn University and one author of a forthcoming House Banking Committee study of the Federal bank insurance fund.
 
Lender of Last Resort
 Mr. Barth is among those who wonder whether the Treasury Department is superseding the Federal Reserve's traditional role as the lender of last resort to banks.
Also at issue is whether Treasury funds should be used to prop up a troubled bank. R. Dan Brumbaugh, another author of the Congressional study, said the Treasury arrangement with Bank of New England was inappropriate and "no different in kind than what Federal savings and loan regulators did to feed the failures in the 1980's."
Mr. Brumbaugh says that by putting money in problem banks, the Government may be giving uninsured depositors time to remove their money, raising the eventual cost to the Government if the banks fail, as happened in the savings bailout.
The Treasury's activities take on increased significance because of strains in the banking system and the shaky condition of the bank insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The fund, which insures bank accounts up to $100,000, is at the lowest level in its 56-year history, and, some experts say, it could become insolvent if there is a deep recession or if a few large institutions collapse.
 
Troubled Real Estate Loans
 The Bank of New England, whose parent company was the 30th-largest banking company in the nation in March, is perhaps the nation's most troubled large bank. Its bad loans, especially from commercial real estate, were the main reason the bank's parent company, which has $13 billion in assets, lost more than $1 billion in 1989. Its stock, which early in 1989 was trading around $20, closed today at $1 a share, unchanged for the day, on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Feb. 26 of this year the Bank of New England reached an agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to reformulate a plan for keeping the bank liquid.
Arthur H. Meehan Jr., the executive vice president and treasurer of the bank, said in an interview that the liquidity plan included use of the Treasury tax and loan account, though selling some of the bank's loans was a more important source of financing.
Over the last year the Treasury has more than tripled the amount of money it has placed in the Bank of New England. The bank's most recent quarterly report lists $975 million in Treasury deposits, up from $296 million at the comparable time in 1989, documents show.
In mid-April of this year, bank officials and regulators say, the Treasury deposited $1.8 billion in the bank. Though the Treasury drew down its deposits during the next two months, they grew again to almost $1 billion by the end of September.
The plan to use Treasury accounts was part of a strategy "to maintain a sound liquidity position for the bank," said Dean DeBuck, a spokesman for the Comptroller's office.
At the time it reached an agreement with Federal regulators in late February, the bank had been borrowing from the Federal Reserve for more than 30 days. The Federal Reserve charges a premium interest rate to banks that borrow for more than 30 days. Since 1974, when the Fed's extended borrowing program was revised, no large bank that has borrowed from the Fed for more than 30 days has survived without Federal assistance, usually a subsidy from the F.D.I.C.
 
Posting Collateral
 Treasury officials say they are blind to where tax and loan accounts wind up. Any bank, no matter how weak or strong, can get these funds by posting the appropriate collateral at a Federal Reserve bank.
Some states have much stricter rules. Connecticut, for example, can invest public funds only in a bank that has a minimum capital ratio of 3 percent, or $3 in stockholders' money for every $100 in assets.
The Bank of New England currently has a 1.11 percent ratio, even though regulators, as part of their February agreement with the bank, required it to reach 3 percent by the end of May. A spokesman for the Comptroller said the office had not enforced its agreement because the bank was making progress in talks with its bondholders about raising capital.
Another concern among some experts is that Treasury regulations allow collateral like Treasury securities, municipal bonds and commercial loans to be valued based on their historical book value, or face value, with some discounts required for lower-grade collateral and some discretion for further discounts.
In the private sector, by contrast, "the most common basis for valuing collateral is marking to market with a discount based on the volatility and liquidity of the underlying collateral," said Robert J. Grossman, managing director of Fitch Investors Service, a credit rating service.
 
A Question of Value
 For example, in the private sector a $10 million real estate loan might be valued at $7 million if the property is hard to sell. But for a $1,000 deposit, the Treasury would accept as collateral a Treasury bond issued for $1,000, even though changes in general interest rates might have reduced the bond's current market value to less than $1,000.
 
An Official's Explanation
 Dan L. Sanford, a vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston who administers the Treasury tax and loan accounts, said the "system has recognized that market value would be better" than the discount system used by the Fed, but it cannot change because its "book entry system is designed around Treasury's requirements to use par value."
A senior Treasury official defended the department's accounting method, saying it is the same as the one used by the Federal Reserve, but does not accept lower grades of collateral like real estate notes or consumer debts that the Federal Reserve accepts. If regulators saw a deterioration in the bank, they could require it to put up more collateral against Treasury funds, the official said.
Other troubled institutions have held tax and loan accounts from the Treasury, including, two years ago, the banks of the First Republic Bank Corporation of Texas, which were failing at the time.
It is unclear, however, whether Federal regulators have previously approved plans by banks other than the Bank of New England to use Treasury funds for liquidity.
 
Reducing Other Borrowing
 The infusions from Treasury enabled the Bank of New England to dramatically reduce its borrowings from the Federal Reserve. In early April, before the Treasury's deposit of $1.8 billion, the bank still owed the Federal Reserve $2.05 billion, according to bank filings.
By April 18, after the infusion of deposits into the Bank of New England's Treasury tax account, borrowings at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston dropped to $14 million, according to a Fed release.
By June 14 the Bank of New England had ended its borrowings from the Federal Reserve and the balance in its tax and loan account was below $100 million, Mr. Meehan said.
The bank's balance sheet for June 30 shows the Treasury's investment in the bank was $832 million. The balance had presumably increased because of tax payments due by June 15 that the Treasury disburses among its depositories.
"Substituting tax deposits for extended credit at the Fed gives the impression that banks are not as bad as they seem, " said James Grant, a financial expert and publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
Most New England banks secure the money in their tax accounts by delivering high-quality securities, like Treasury bills, to the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston, Mr. Sanford said. But the Bank of New England and a few other banks have placed commercial loans as collateral. Many of the bank's loans are in New England, where the economy has been troubled for some time.
Mr. Meehan said these commercial loans involve the bank's better customers and the Federal Reserve values them at 30 percent below their book value.
Federal Reserve and Treasury officials said there was enough additional collateral to protect the Treasury's account at the Bank of New England. They declined, however, to say exactly how much collateral secures the Treasury's investment.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DECISION;
BUSH, LIFTING 15-YEAR-OLD BAN, APPROVES LOANS FOR KREMLIN TO HELP EASE FOOD SHORTAGES

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
President Bush moved today to help the Soviet Union meet anticipated winter shortages by approving up to $1 billion in Federal loans to allow Moscow to buy food and other agricultural goods.
Lifting a 15-year-old ban on such credits, Mr. Bush also said he would propose that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund give Moscow a "special association" that would provide assistance and advice in transforming the Soviet command economy into a market-driven system. [Transcript of Mr. Bush's remarks, page A22.] 
 Mr. Bush's action was considered by experts to be a first step toward the full membership in those institutions, which has long been denied to Moscow.
 
In White House Rose Garden
 The move will increase American farm exports, but is unlikely in the short term to lead to a big surge in two-way trade between the two countries, which will amount to about $3.6 billion worth of goods this year -- little more than what the United States exchanges with Haiti. [Page A22.]
Appearing in the White House Rose Garden with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on an unusually mild December afternoon, Mr. Bush announced that he and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would meet in Moscow on Feb. 11-13 for their next get-together He said he hoped to sign a treaty limiting long-range strategic nuclear weapons during that meeting.
 
Summit After Iraq Deadline
 The summit meeting is to take place about a month after the Jan. 15 date by which Iraqi troops are supposed to leave Kuwait or face the possibility of military action. This raised the question of whether Mr. Bush would authorize an attack on Iraq in the period before the summit meeting or whether he would prefer to discuss the situation further with Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow.
In addition to the agricultural loans, which came in the form of a six-month waiver of the law barring export credits to Moscow until it permits free emigration, Mr. Bush announced that the Federal government would provide financial and organizational assistance to private organizations willing to supply emergency medical and pharmaceutical supplies to the Soviet Union.
Although the Administration believes that the food shortages in the Soviet Union are in large measure a distribution problem, not the result of crop failures, the United States hopes that emergency shipments will provide a short-term solution while patterns of distribution are corrected for the long term.
Mr. Bush's actions came in response to a request from the Soviet Government for financial assistance in acquiring agricultural and medical products. American officials said the Soviet Union was expected to use the agricultural loans primarily to buy grain.
Although Moscow has gold and diamonds to sell, it prefers to do so in small amounts to avoid driving down prices for those commodities, Administration officials said. Because of its chaotic transportation situation, the Soviet Union would also have difficulty delivering enough oil to foreign markets to raise emergency cash.
 
Praises Emigration Changes
 In explaining his actions, Mr. Bush said he wanted to "respond both to the short-term needs of the Soviet Union and to contribute to fundamental economic reform." He said he wanted to recognize the "excellent" progress Moscow has made in permitting emigration. This year, some 150,000 Soviet Jews have moved to Israel and 50,000 to the United States..
But it was also clear that Mr. Bush was hoping to bolster the Government of Mr. Gorbachev, which could be imperiled by severe winter shortages of food and medical supplies.
"The Soviet Union is facing tough times, difficult times," Mr. Bush said. "But I believe that this is a good reason to act now, in order to help the Soviet Union stay the course of democratization and to undertake market reforms."
Mr. Shevardnadze suggested that beyond seeing the floundering Soviet food system through the winter, the Soviet leadership saw Mr. Bush's actions today as a more sweeping boost to Mr. Gorbachev's political and economic policies.
"The fact is that there is certain instability in the Soviet Union and we are worried about that," he said. Mr. Shevardnadze added, "It would be a terrible thing if we were unable to assure the stability of the Soviet Union. It would be a terrible thing for Europe and for the world."
 
Some Restrictions Stay
 Mr. Bush's actions today, which won wide and immediate praise from many lawmakers, American Jewish groups and human rights advocates, did not entirely lift all the trading restrictions that have been in place since 1951, when normal trade relations with the Soviet Union were first curbed in the aftermath of Soviet backing for North Korea's invasion of South Korea.
But Mr. Bush used his power o grant a temporary waiver, until next June, of parts of the 1974 Jackson-Vanik law, which sought to restrict the resumption of normal trade until the Soviet Union permitted free emigration.
Specifically, he lifted the law's ban on loans issued under the auspices of the Commodities Credit Corporation, an arm of the Department of Agriculture, and authorized between $500 million and $1 billion in Federally guaranteed loans. Administration officials said money would be made available within 45 days after the Soviet Union asked for it.
The record on foreign countries' repayment of such loans, which are made with taxpayer dollars, is mixed.
But Mr. Bush did not move to lift the more sweeping and long-term restrictions on trade with Moscow that are now in effect.
 
Waiting for Policy Codification
 The President said he would continue to withhold from Congressional consideration the trade agreement that he and Mr. Gorbachev signed here last June -- and the favorable trade terms, known as most-favored nation status, that are associated with it -- until the Soviet Union enacts a new law that codifies its new emigration policies.
Mr. Shevardnadze said such a law would be passed "in the nearest future." But Soviet officials have been offering such assurances for more than a year and American officials said today that the draft emigration law has recently been amended in a way that could add significant restrictions.
Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze vehemently denied that the trade concessions were intended as a "payback" for Soviet cooperation in the Persian Gulf crisis.
His pique evident in his voice, Mr. Shevardnadze said: "There was no crisis in the Persian Gulf when our two Presidents met at Malta, and then there were other talks and discussions between them. And I am also referring to our ministerial meetings in Wyoming and at Irkutsk, where we spoke about cooperation and partnership."
 
'A Very New Phase'
 "All the other things, such as the Persian Gulf crisis and our cooperation on the Security Council resolutions, those were after those important events," he said.
Mr. Shevardnadze said Mr. Bush's announcements today "show that we are indeed in a very new phase of our relations."
In addition to opening the door for the Soviet Union to American and other Wesern financial markets, Mr. Bush's actions today tied his Government even more closely to that of Mr. Gorbachev at a time when the Soviet leadership is facing mounting political challenges.
A senior Administration official acknowledged that there was a risk that giving Mr. Gorbachev a major financial and political boost at this time could be seen in the Soviet Union as meddling in the country's delicate political balance.
But the official said the United States hoped to avoid that by stressing the importance of continuing Soviet economic reforms, as Mr. Bush did in his statement today. "There is no question that this is a delicate situation and that is why it has taken so long for us to come to the decision to announce these steps today," the official said.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Harmony: Labor Pact Till 1995

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12

 BODY:
In an action hailed as a major step toward improved labor relations in Hollywood, movie and television producers and writers today announced they had reached an agreement to extend through mid-1995 their existing contract, achieved only after a long, bitter and costly strike in 1988.
The extension of that contract, which was scheduled to expire on May 1, 1992, would prevent the 9,000 members of the Writers Guild of America from going on strike any time during the next four and a half years. In return, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, representing some 200 production companies and film studios, has guaranteed a 4.5 percent annual increase in minimum fees paid for scripts and most television reruns. 
 "This is a very happy occasion that I never thought I would see in my lifetime," said George Kirgo, president of the Writers Guild of America West. "It means that for at least five years there will be peace for all of us."
Privately, representatives of both producers and writers said they were eager to avoid a repetition of the five-month strike of 1988. That labor action caused production delays or cancellations at film studios, led to a dramatic drop in ratings for television networks, resulted in layoffs for thousands of production employees and left many writers with significantly reduced incomes.
 
A Contract Adjustment Panel
 At a news conference here this morning, both sides said the key to the agreement was the creation of a new Contract Adjustment Committee. That group, which includes representatives of both producers and writers, will be empowered to negotiate changes in the existing contract, which then, like today's agreement, must be approved by the guild membership.
"There will be no ability of the guild to strike over these terms, and there will be no ability of the companies to lock out the writers," said Brian Walton, the chief negotiator for the writers' union. "Instead, both sides will have an incentive, we hope and believe, to work together for mutual advantage."
In theory, today's agreement could provide a model for similar agreements between producers and representatives of other Hollywood employees like directors and craft and technical workers. But J. Nicholas Counter, president of the producers alliance, cautioned that such progress "depends on the personality, structure and politics of each union."
By agreeing to extend the 1988 contract until 1995, the two groups have possibly defused tension over a number of issues that promised to be contentious in coming years. Among them are the determination of writer credits and increased payments of writer royalties or residuals for programs broadcast on cable television outlets.
 
Bright Prospects for All
 The movie business will take in more than $4.6 billion at the box office this year, a figure exceeded only in 1988, and industry analysts predict just as strong a performance over the next few years, along with burgeoning video and foreign revenues. In view of those bright prospects, neither side appears eager to put its share of an expanding pie in jeopardy.
In particular, the original 1992 expiration date of the current contract is potentially awkward, both sides have said privately. Later that year, the 12 nations of the European Economic Community, including such film and television production powerhouses as Britain, France and Italy, are scheduled to become a single market, and a strike in the United States, one production executive acknowledged, "could paralyze us and put us at a competitive disadvantage just as our business is becoming more global."
This morning, Mr. Walton said: "Both sides need to make this work. The need for change is obvious." He cited "new technologies, new ownerships of companies, the rise of cable, and increased international competition" as factors demanding a "nonconfrontational approach" between producers and writers.
Both groups must also contend with internal policy differences that could limit their effectiveness and maneuverability during a labor dispute. During the 1988 strike, an active dissident faction emerged in the Writers Guild, and in 1985 a strike effort collapsed after two weeks, in part because of a lack of unity, union members said.
For their part, producers too must confront potentially crippling divisions, most notably between television networks, which found themselves without sufficient programming in 1988, and studios. The networks, prohibited by law from having a full ownership stake in programs they broadcast, would also like to expand into production; if their campaign to change those rules succeeds, they would have even less reason to want to join forces with other producers they wish to supplant.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
And That's Why They Play All 82 Games

BYLINE: By SAM GOLDAPER

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, after one month of the National Basketball Association season, playing out the remainder of the schedule appeared to be just a formality for all the teams except Detroit and Portland.
The Pistons, in the midst of a 10-game winning streak, had a 13-3 record and the Trail Blazers, after winning their first 11 games, were 12-1. It seemed more practical just to let the Pistons and the Trail Blazers resume last season's championship series. 
 But things have changed, and maybe that's why the league has an 82-game regular-season schedule.
While the Trail Blazers have extended their record to 19-1, the Pistons have not only lost five of their last six games, but they have also scored 100 points in a game only once during that stretch. That came in their lone victory, against the lowly Sacramento Kings.
The Pistons' turnaround began with a road loss in which they scored only 83 points against the Washington Bullets, one of the N.B.A.'s least successful teams. The losing streak reached four straight with road losses to the Los Angeles Lakers, the Utah Jazz and the Golden State Warriors. After the victory in Sacramento, the Pistons, hoping to resume their dominant ways, returned to the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich., where they had won 77 of 90 games. Not only did they fail to score 100 points again, they also lost, 95-86, to the San Antonio Spurs. They have shot 45 percent from the field in the last six games.
Looking back to a year ago, the Pistons got off to a 13-10 start before winning 25 of their next 26 games, en route to their second straight championship.
That may be the reason why Chuck Daly, usually a worried coach, still sounds optimistic.
"We're kind of stuck in the mud right now," Daly said yesterday by telephone from Michigan. "We're in a mild recession, but I'm like the President of the United States: I'm not ready to admit we're in a basketball recession. I know this team. It's too good a team and I have to believe we're going to snap out of it. Like every team, it may need a little refining, some tuneup here and there or some small changes. We'll keep looking at it."
It doesn't get any easier. Starting tomorrow night, the Pistons' next three games are against the Boston Celtics, the Milwaukee Bucks and the Chicago Bulls, three of the Eastern Conference's top teams.
 
Thanks a Lot
 Talk about gratitude. After Jack McCloskey, the Pistons' general manager, presented David Greenwood with his championship ring in a pregame ceremony, Greenwood went out and played like a champion for the San Antonio Spurs. The 6-foot-9-inch forward, used sparingly by the Pistons last season, signed a one-year contract with a one-year option with the Spurs as an unrestricted free agent. Not only did he score 12 points and grab 5 rebounds against his former team, but he also donated $10,000 to Methodist Children's Hospital in Detroit, proceeds from the sale of T-shirts during last June's championship series. . . . With their 2-1 Texas trip, the Celtics, whose 16-4 mark is the second best in the league, increased their record over the Houston Rockets, the Spurs and the Dallas Mavericks to 65-11 since Larry Bird came to Boston for the 1979-80 season. . . . Since December 1962, the Celtics own a 17-1 record against the Pistons at the Boston Garden.
 
That's Entertainment
 The Denver Nuggets, who brought their record to 5-15 by beating the Washington Bullets on Tuesday night, are the only team in the N.B.A. that has scored at least 100 points and given up at least 100 in every game. The Nuggets are averaging 128.9 points and giving up 138.1. The sidelight to the Washington game was the battle for league scoring honors: Bernard King of the Bullets had 34 points and Orlando Woolridge, the league leader, had 33. . . . Michael Adams, the catalyst of the Nuggets' run-and-gun attack, has attempted 87 3-point baskets in the 11 games he has played, almost 8 a game. He has made 23. . . . Look for many changes in the days ahead. Any player still on a roster after Dec. 27 must be paid for the entire season. . . . The trade that brought Jeff Malone from the Bullets to the Utah Jazz is beginning to make a notable difference, as Coach Jerry Sloan had hoped. Tuesday night's 135-117 victory over the Golden State Warriors, the Jazz's fifth straight victory and their 10th in 11 games, was a Malone show. Jeff Malone, hitting from the outside, had 43 points, while Karl Malone, Mr. Inside, scored 35. Feeding them was John Stockton, who had 21 assists, 2 fewer than in his last game against the Los Angeles Clippers.
 
Ominous Assignment
 The last three coaches to take their teams to the McDonald's Open -- Jimmy Rodgers of the Celtics, Doug Moe of the Nuggets and Stu Jackson of the Knicks -- were let go after winning the N.B.A.'s overseas showcase tournament.
The league will announce soon that the Lakers will be its representative in the next open, which will be held in October in Paris. Is Mike Dunleavy looking for a new job yet?

HEADLINE: Formation of an Opposition Party Announced at a Rally in Albania

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Amid scenes of jubiliation, the formation of the first opposition party in Communist-ruled Albania was announced today at a huge rally in Tirana, the capital.
Called the Democratic Party, the new group has already applied at the Ministry of Justice to establish its legal status, one of its founding members, Gramoz Pashko, who is a prominent university economics professor, said in a telephone interview from Tirana. That ministry was recreated last summer after having been abolished 23 years earlier.
On Tuesday, after three days of anti-Government demonstrations by university students, the Communist Party central committee endorsed in an emergency session "the creation of independent political organizations."
 
No Multiparty Tradition
 Albania has been ruled uncontested by the Communist Party since 1946, and until Tuesday the party leadership had consistently declared that it would never permit opposition parties.
The small Balkan country of 3.3 million has no traditions of political parties or parliamentary government. During World War II opposing groups of nationalists, royalists and fascists tried to gain political footing, but were swept aside by the Communists.
Six weeks ago, Mr. Pashko, who is 35 years old, began describing himself to foreign visitors as "a dissident." He was at the time still a member of the Communist Party, as was his friend, Ismail Kadare, a prominent writer, who defected to France in October.
Joining the economist in announcing the founding of the Democratic Party at today's rally in the university's "Student City" were Azem Hajdari, 28, a philosophy student who played a leading role in organizing the student revolt, and Dr. Sali Berisha, 45, a Tirana cardiologist.
 
'Democracy! Democracy!'
 Mr. Pashko said about 80,000 people attended the rally - "workers, of course students, artists, lawyers, all kinds of people." Others at the scene estimated higher numbers. Tirana has a population of 300,000. The crowd chanted "Democracy! Democracy!" The economist said that although some students had been injured in clashes with special police forces on Sunday and Monday there had been no fatalities.
As yet the Democratic Party founders have chosen no leaders, Mr. Pashko said, and they have only begun to sketch out a party platform, which he said would include advocating a multiparty system, protection of human rights, a free market economy and good neighborly relations.
In a departure, however, Azem Hajdari, the student leader, said the Democratic Party would "work for the peaceful democratic union between Albania and Kosovo," the neighboring Yugoslav province of Serbia whose inhabitants are 90 percent ethnic Albanians. This call from Tirana could lead to friction with the Belgrade authorities.
Both Mr. Hajdfari and Mr. Pashko paid respects to Ramiz Alia, the Communist President and party chief, for introducing a reform program that paves the way for multiparty system. National elections are set for Feb. 10.

HEADLINE: Cavazos and Bush: A Shared Failure

 BODY:
The resignation of Lauro Cavazos as Secretary of Education comes as no great surprise. Virtually invisible during his two-year tenure, he has offered few initiatives and showed little flair for the arena. But his ineffectiveness says less about him than about his boss. How serious has President Bush really been about education?
Public education is in deep trouble. American students are leaving schools without adequate skills, threatening economic security and the social fabric. True, education is largely a state and local responsibility; but the Federal Government plays an important role, particularly in insuring equal education opportunity. It can also be an effective catalyst. 
 Mr. Bush pledged to be the "education President." Faced with huge budget deficits, however, he has offered more symbols than dollars. Fifteen months ago, when he summoned the nation's governors to an education "summit conference," he offered mainly bromides. And Mr. Cavazos was hardly in evidence.
The governors have since outlined a half-dozen laudable goals for the year 2000, including a high school graduation rate of at least 90 percent and prekindergarten programs for all children. The Administration took one big step, proposing an increase in Head Start financing. Congress went even further, passing legislation that could allow every eligible child to participate by 1994.
But there's so much more to be done. Schools need radical restructuring and a renewed commitment to equal opportunity for all students, including the poor. That will require not only money but also an aggressive effort to help school districts redesign their curriculums. Mr. Cavazos, however, has been a Johnny One-Note, fixated by the notion that giving parents more freedom to choose schools will solve many of the nation's education ills.
The official White House line is that Mr. Cavazos was dumped to make way for a more forceful Secretary who would help Mr. Bush buttress his claim to be the "education President." But isn't that also the President's job?

HEADLINE: Foreign Graduate Students Know Hardship

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The high percentage of foreign students in United States graduate schools (front page, Nov. 29) warrants questioning of the choices that American society and American students are willing to make to keep this country's industrial and technological edge. In contrast, the sacrifices that many foreign students make for a graduate education are beyond the experience of most Americans. 
 The foreign students who receive financial aid in return for labor performed do not pose a threat to American students. Your example of $20,000 a year in financial aid provided by the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, a private institution, is at the extremely high end of the scale. More typical is the state university that offers graduate assistantships of $7,000 to $8,000 a year. It is in these institutions where most foreign graduate students are found, many living in conditions of hardship and poverty.
In a recent visit to New Jersey Institute of Technology (where, as you report, 734 of 887 full-time graduate students are from Asia), I found that the lives of many Chinese students are not much better than their counterparts in mainland China. The students with research assistantships are managing to scrape by on $600 a month, but must spend so much time doing research for professors on whose good will they depend that they end up having to study until all hours of the morning to make the grades to stay in the program.
Students without assistantships are likely to have low-paying jobs working long hours, like a young Chinese woman I met, a Ph.D. candidate in engineering who works as an assistant cook to pay her way through school.
The objections of Americans to foreign faculty members and students are ill founded. To be fair, there is an exception to the hostility and xenophobia in American graduate business schools. Institutions like the Stern School of Business at New York University, where I am a part-time M.B.A. student, are building their reputations on having international business programs, foreign faculty members and foreign students.
With the future of American business inextricably linked to foreign economies and markets, students value learning different perspectives from professors and fellow students who have accents, whether they are Greek, Chinese, German or Indian.
If we do not retain these bright foreign scholars and scientists in the United States, and if we do not mend an education system turning out mediocre native talent from elementary school up, one day we will turn to foreign countries for their superior technology.

HEADLINE: Cuba Pioneering in Energy Conservation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In Cuba, Swapping Bulls for Tractors?" (Op-Ed, Nov. 19) by Roger Fontaine and William Ratliff argues that it is not too farfetched to assume that the key to easing the transition to a post-Fidel Castro regime is joint United States-Soviet support "for a democratic, free-market Cuba." 
 To someone who has spent some time in both the Soviet Union and Cuba in the last three months, this seems to be the height of wishful thinking. While it is true that past foreign aid to Cuba and all other third world countries is highly unpopular in the Soviet Union, as reflected in the pages of Komsomolskaya Pravda and other journals of the glasnost era, there was no countervailing Cuban anger at the Russians or President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the Soviet elimination of Cuba's oil subsidy. Rather, there were kind remarks concerning the past generosity of their former benefactors.
The Soviet underwriting of Cuban economic development permitted the Cubans to waste energy in many areas. The campaign to save energy has forced the planners to substitute animal power and bicycles for the gas guzzlers still operating as a result of the efforts of clever Cuban mechanics. Rather than "returning Cuba to its preindustrial past, a literal dark age," the ingenious Cuban decision makers are planning a society that will appeal to environmentalists and may be the wave of our own future in the 21st century if the global warmers are right.
The Cuban problems today and for the next several years are better handled through planning a la wartime economies than with the "democratic free market" solution now being experimented with in Eastern Europe. Rationing is more acceptable in Cuba than elsewhere because it has been institutionalized during the last 30 years. Only the number of products subject to rationing varies over time, and they will undoubtedly be increased over the next several years as Cuba adjusts to less reliance on Eastern European socialist countries and more friendly economic relations with other Latin American countries.
The Russians have made it clear that they are more interested in their own problems than in telling erstwhile members of the Soviet bloc how to handle their economies. If any of these countries comes up with solutions, Mr. Gorbachev is certainly ready to consider similar measures, but he apparently is not going to insist that these countries adopt any particular solution. Thus, it is likely that the Poles will revert to the interwar Poland of Marshal Josef Pilsudski, that the Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians will finally settle for social democracy, and the Cubans will continue their Latin version of "actually existing socialism."

HEADLINE: Don't Count Overtime For Pension Purposes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Recession -- It Took Time, But New York Yields to Laws of Gravity" (The Week in Review, Dec. 2): It is time New York City government ended costly and unjustified municipal excesses. 
 One persistent, glaring example is the policy and practice of permitting overtime pay to be calculated along with annual salary for pension purposes. This is particularly true for uniformed forces (police, fire, sanitation) whose employees often retire with annual pensions far in excess of annual salaries.
The effect of this overgenerous policy is to cost the taxpayers and the city millions of dollars in unnecessary, unjustified pension costs.
I suggest that Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council simply exempt overtime pay from calculation for pension purposes. The city should follow the example of New York State and the private sector, which do not permit the calculation of overtime pay for pension purposes on behalf of their employees.
In so doing, the city government would spare New York City taxpayers this imprudent and excessive cost. With the city in fiscal crisis, it is time to end this largess simply by the stroke of a pen.

HEADLINE: Tough Choices For Connecticut As Boom Ends

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
Perhaps Connecticut's political leaders thought that the boom years of the 1980's would last indefinitely. Certainly they based their budgets on that hope. And now that the boom is over, a budget deficit is emerging so large that this wealthy state is being forced toward a historic overhaul of its tax system and much less generous public spending.
Many states are struggling with budget deficits, but Connecticut's is so far the most overwhelming. The main reason is that the state's principal tax -- an 8 percent sales tax that is among the highest in the nation -- generated huge revenues when times were good. But when recession struck New England last year and people curbed their spending, the sales tax faltered almost overnight. And what was once a small budget deficit mushroomed. 
 "A confluence of things is coming together that is making the budget situation in Connecticut as nightmarish today as it was wonderful in the 1980's," said William A. McEachern, a University of Connecticut economist.
 
A Taboo Is Considered
 Suddenly the Governor-elect, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., is scrambling to reduce a deficit that is already nearly $500 million for this fiscal year and is projected to be $1.5 billion for the year that starts next July 1, if current spending is maintained. The $1.5 billion represents nearly 20 percent of the projected budget outlay of $7.9 billion -- a higher percentage than any other state has acknowledged, according to the National Association of State Budget Offices.
Because public support has not materialized for a cutback in major public spending programs, Mr. Weicker is being pushed to consider an income tax on wages. His predecessors, Ella T. Grasso and William A. O'Neill Jr., had sworn for nearly 20 years that they would never enact such a tax.
They relied instead on the sales tax for 40 percent of the state government's revenues, and on a corporate income tax -- the highest in the nation -- for 13 percent more. But the recession took the steam out of profits and consumer spending, and state budget outlays, as a result, have continued to rise sharply while revenues, for the first time, have shrunk.
"When you get shrinking sales and corporate tax revenues, as we've gotten recently, then the deficit numbers can go up very quickly," said Anthony V. Milano, Budget Director for Governor O'Neill, who leaves office in January. Connecticut has gone from a budget surplus in 1988 to today's deficits.
In all but nine other states, an income tax cushions the tax revenue swings that come when corporate profits and consumer spending fluctuate sharply. But unlike Connecticut, most of the nine other states without an income tax either have substitute revenue sources, like a tax on oil or gambling, or they rely on a sales tax but have not yet experienced the severe recession that has struck the Northeast.
"The general impression is that Connecticut is in the greatest trouble, but its difficulties may be a precursor of what's ahead for other states," said Marcia Howard, research director at the National Association of State Budget Offices.
 
Engines of Growth Slow to a Crawl
 The reversal in fortunes is taking place in a state that is home to some of the nation's wealthiest suburbs, like Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan, and some of America's poorest cities, among them Bridgeport, New Haven and the capital itself, Hartford. Much of the increased state spending in the 1980's was to pay for welfare, low-income housing, Medicaid and other services for the poor in the cities.
The 1980's boom that generated the tax revenue for this public spending showed up in Connecticut as a burst of construction and real-estate deals that brought new office towers, apartments, shopping malls and corporate headquarters to suburbs and cities, often altering skylines that had been dominated by huge, empty red-brick factories from an earlier industrial era. The state's big military and insurance industries also prospered.
But the big engines of growth were in construction, retailing, real estate and the tens of thousands of new jobs to staff the corporate offices that moved to Connecticut. Employment climbed to more than 1.6 million, and in the fall of 1988, the unemployment rate was only 2.7 percent, the nation's lowest.
"For a long time, cities like Hartford and New Haven had the lowest building vacancy rate in the nation," said Edward Deak, an econonomist at Fairfield University. "People said, 'Let's put up another building and we'll make a killing.' It was the same in housing."
Then real estate and new construction collapsed, vacancy rates shot up, and this was accompanied by a sharp downturn in banking and insurance. The military contractors still do well, increasing the value of their contracts over the last two years. But they, too, have laid off workers.
So have thousands of small manufacturers -- shops that employ fewer than 250 people -- among them metal-working operations, machine shops, manufacturers of electronics parts and others who have survived Connecticut's decline as a manufacturing state. Manufacturing employment is down 12 percent in five years and keeps falling, eliminating many higher-paying jobs.
The unemployment rate has climbed above 5 percent and total personal income, the highest in the nation on a per capita basis at $23,440, is rising this year by less than 3 percent -- after having risen through the 1980's at two or three times that pace annually.
"Rapid economic growth is a wonderful thing as long as it lasts; it's a nirvana," said Nicholas Perna, chief economist at Connecticut National Bank. "What it did was allow us to crank up public spending as if the rate of growth were endless."
 
A Reluctance To Trim Spending
 Despite flagging tax receipts, many states besides Connecticut have been reluctant to cut spending for such things as education, highways, new prisons, low-income housing, welfare and pay increases for state employees.
Complicating their problems, the states picked up new burdens as Federal subsidies were phased out. After adjusting for inflation, Mr. Milano's office estimates that Connecticut spends $300 million a year in outlays that once came from Washington.
The upshot has been rising deficits across the country, but Connecticut's biggest neighbors, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, still have deficits -- actual and projected -- that are less than 10 percent of budget outlays. Only North Carolina and Michigan are approaching Connecticut's level.
The big rise in spending here in the 1980's was partly to address what the General Assembly and Governor O'Neill judged to be crises. For instance, after the Mianus River Bridge on the Connecticut Turnpike in Greenwich collapsed in 1983, killing three people, the state undertook a $7 billion, 10-year upgrade of its highway system.
Because public schools were having trouble attracting and holding good teachers, the General Assembly in 1986 mandated higher salaries, financed mostly by the state. Now the average pay for a Connecticut teacher is $28,000 a year, the highest in the nation.
Pay increases not only for teachers, but for most of Connecticut's nearly 183,000 public employees, are ranging from 7 percent to 9 percent this year. To help pay those increases, state aid to municipalities has risen to nearly $1.4 billion from $783 million in 1985. The big pay increases are a result, in part, of binding arbitration awards.
Aside from the higher pay, rising Medicaid costs now account for 15 percent of Connecticut's total outlays. Nearly half of the $6.5 billion current budget goes for Medicaid, for the subsidies to Connecticut's 169 municipalities, and to pay more than $600 million in interest on state bonds that finance capital spending and, now, the deficit.
"These are the radical increases of the 1980's, especially the aid to the towns," said William J. Cibes Jr. (pronounced SEA-bess), a political science professor at Connecticut College whom Mr. Weicker recently named as his budget director. "Most of the town aid is for schools and to subsidize municipal budgets so local property taxes can be held down."
 
Deficit Fuels Income Tax Debate
 The O'Neill administration acknowledged the huge deficit a week after Mr. Weicker's election, and now that the numbers are out, a debate has begun over whether the state should adopt an income tax on wages. During a similar budget crisis in 1971, the General Assembly adopted such a tax at 4 A.M. one July morning, and Gov. Thomas J. Meskill signed the bill. The public outcry was so great that six weeks later the legislature repealed the tax.
The trauma left its mark on Mr. Meskill's successors, Mrs. Grasso and Mr. O'Neill. Both pledged not to propose an income tax, though during their terms they pushed up other taxes periodically, so that today the state sales tax, at 8 percent, the corporate tax at 13.8 percent and a maximum 14 percent tax on unearned income -- from dividends, interest and capital gains -- are higher than in any other state.
Mr. Weicker, a former Republican who ran for governor as an independent, and Mr. Cibes, his budget director and a former Democratic representative in the General Assembly, have announced that they will try first to reduce spending. But Mr. Cibes argues that even with spending cuts, new tax revenue will be needed.
Mr. Weicker has not taken the pledge against a personal income tax. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but his press secretary, Avice A. Mehan, said, "He wants very much to keep his options open."
Until his appointment as Mr. Weicker's budget director, Mr. Cibes had advocated an income tax on wages. Right now, of the $82 billion in total personal income of Connecticut's 3.2 million people, only $15.8 billion is subject to taxes, as nonwage earnings.
"No one likes an income tax, but you have to look at the alternatives," said Ralph J. Caruso, director of the Legislature's Office of Fiscal Analysis. "If the alternatives are higher existing taxes or substantial reductions in services, then you have to see. I haven't seen a broad constituency that says we should substantially reduce services."
 
Property Tax Rise: Unpopular Option
 The other potential source of substantial new tax revenue would be an increase in the property taxes levied by municipalities. That alternative has helped convince some executives that an income tax is a lesser evil. "If you stood up in a room of businessmen and said that you favored an income tax, you would no longer be thrown out of the room," said Paul S. Goulekas, an assistant vice president at Aetna, the insurance giant headquartered here.
Opposition to property-tax increases has shown up in more than a dozen communities that in recent months have voted down municipal budgets requiring higher property taxes to offset cutbacks in state funding. Below the state level, the municipal property tax is the only major source of tax revenue in a state that does not collect highway tolls or other user fees.
Although property taxes raise a total of $3.9 billion a year in Connecticut, some experts argue that property owners are undertaxed. They note that the state's effective property tax rate -- the amount of tax actually paid as a percent of a property's market value -- is 1.46 percent, ranking Connecticut 12th in the nation, behind New Jersey (first) and New York (fifth).
The O'Neill administration "was committed to keeping property taxes as low as possible," Mr. Milano said. Mr. Weicker and Mr. Cibes have not made a similar commitment.
 
Until a Rebound, One-Time Remedies
 As the deficit developed over the last year, Governor O'Neill and the legislature resorted to patchwork remedies to keep it under control until the economy rebounded. "One-timers," their solutions were called, and they involved practices common in other states.
The administration, for example, drew down every penny of the $315 million in two surplus funds. Some $25 million in corporate taxes to be collected next July and August will be assigned to pay this year's bills. And $250 million in pension fund contributions were postponed until next year.
"We thought last December that we would have a $500 million deficit problem and the one-timers were considered sufficient to solve it," Mr. Cibes said. They hardly made a dent.
What's more, the spending in the 1991-1992 fiscal year is projected to rise by $1.4 billion from this year's levels, mostly because of the postponed pension fund payments, along with $615 million in higher Medicaid payments and aid to the towns and cities.
All this is a far cry from the mid-1980's, when annual surpluses prompted tax reductions.
"I voted to do this," Mr. Cibes said. "It appeared that with surpluses running at $300 million a year, people would say they were over-taxed. Now a lot of people would say that we made a mistake."

HEADLINE: Cavazos Quits as Education Chief Amid Pressure From White House

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Lauro F. Cavazos resigned under pressure as Secretary of Education today, even as his department and the Administration were plunged into a storm over a decision to bar Federal aid to colleges that offer scholarships designated solely for minority students.
Mr. Cavazos's resignation followed a White House meeting on Tuesday in which John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, told the Secretary that President Bush wanted him to leave the Cabinet by the end of the month, a White House aide said. Mr. Cavazos, 63 years old and the nation's first Hispanic Cabinet member, said he would leave by the end of this week. 
 The departure was announced today at a Cabinet meeting that Mr. Cavazos did not attend. He issued a terse resignation letter that omitted the customary thanks to the President for the honor of serving in the Cabinet.
Senior White House officials seemed as surprised as anyone else to hear of the new scholarship policy, disclosed Tuesday by an assistant education secretary, and were careful to note that Mr. Bush had not put his stamp of approval on it.
But they insisted that there was no connection between the policy and the forced resignation.
Some people close to Mr. Cavazos said he was upset by the scholarship policy and by the combative new posture of the Administration on affirmative action programs.
White House officials said Mr. Cavazos was being forced out because a more forceful presence was needed at the helm of the Education Department. They said that as the 1992 elections approached, they needed to buttress Mr. Bush's assertion that he was the "Education President."
Mr. Cavazos, who was president of Texas Tech University for eight years before he became President Ronald Reagan's Education Secretary in 1988, has long been considered by Mr. Bush's advisers to be a weak link in the Bush Cabinet. The President's domestic policy adviser, Roger Porter, has been the Administration's point man on education.
White House officials began looking for a successor, and said possible candidates included Thomas Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey who has been a leader in education reform efforts in the past six years, and Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee Governor.
The statement that "race-exclusive" scholarships were discriminatory and therefore illegal was made by Michael L. Williams, the head of the civil rights office in the Education Department. Mr. Williams said today that he had not acted under instructions from the White House but had talked with lower level White House staff members who were friends and acquaintances.
 
Policy Change Surprises Bush
 Senior White House officials said the statement was being reviewed.
"The President was not aware of the strategy prior to its undertaking," John Herrick, a White House spokesman, said tonight. "Now that we are aware of it, the White House is reviewing it."
White House officials said they were looking into the decision to see if it was legal, if it was "easily reversible" and if it should be reversed.
Mr. Williams's announcement had a scalding effect in education and civil rights circles. Critics raised questions about its timing, following Mr. Bush's veto of a major civil rights bill and the bellicose comments of William J. Bennett, the former Education Department chief and Mr. Bush's new choice to head the Republican National Committee, that he was ready to challenge Democrats on the issue of racial quotas and affirmative action.
 
Accusations of 'Race Baiting'
 The American Council on Education, which represents over 1,600 higher education institutions, issued a statement advising its colleges and universities "to continue their current practices" on minority scholarships.
"It would represent a giant step backward in efforts to improve educational opportunities for the nation's minority students," said Robert H. Atwell, the President of the American Council on Education.
Ralph Neas, the executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, charged that "the Bush Administration seems determined to compile a worse civil rights record than the Reagan Administration."
Janell Byrd, the assistant counsel with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, declared the scholarship decision was "race baiting -- there is no other word for it."
 
Tapping White Resentment
 Critics of the scholarship policy said that as the nation entered a recession there was more of a tendency to look for a political scapegoat and lash out at programs designed to redress grievances against minorities.
Christopher Edley Jr., a law professor at Harvard University who was an adviser to Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 Presidential election, said the shift "comes at a time when many whites feel as though they have been made to sacrifice to create opportunities for others."
"They think they've paid enough, and the Bush people are aware of that feeling out there," he said.
Many Republicans are convinced that an anti-quota position has great appeal to large numbers of white voters, particularly economically pressed working class Americans who feel resentful about what they perceive as advantages for minorities.
 
A Dangerous Path
 Republican party strategists insisted today that they did not expect a general backlash from people who might consider the Administration action heavy handed. Any backlash that did develop, they said, would be largely concentrated among blacks and liberal whites, who do not support Mr. Bush in large percentages anyway.
Two political dangers face Mr. Bush, strategists from both parties say. The first is that he will undermine his efforts to reach out to minority voters. But more importantly, from an electoral point of view, there is a risk of antagonizing moderate, suburban Republicans for whom any hint of veiled racism is distasteful.
Robert Teeter, a top Bush strategist, said that the Administration's actions should not be seen as an ominous pattern by civil rights groups.
"Anybody who thinks George Bush is turning his back on civil rights is 100 percent wrong," he said.
 
Leaving Office by 5 P.M.
 Mr. Cavazos's resignation came before an investigation into his wife's role at the department, conducted by the Education Department's inspector general's office, was made public.
Peggy Ann Cavazos, a former nurse and the mother of their 10 children, came to the office daily with her husband and kept an office next to his for a period. She also sat in on meetings, edited speeches and policy papers and traveled with him.
Mr. Bush's advisers had worried that Mr. Cavazos, who liked to leave the office by 4:45 P.M., was turning into a political liability and undermining Mr. Bush's attempt to claim education as a strong suit.
Mr. Porter, the domestic policy adviser, had already sluiced away much of Mr. Cavazos's power, moving Charles Kolb, a deputy to Mr. Cavazos, onto his White House staff.
Mr. Cavazos is the third high-ranking Bush official to resign recently. Elizabeth H, Dole, the Labor Secretary and the only woman in the Bush Cabinet, resigned in October. Mr. Bennett also resigned last month as Mr. Bush's drug policy director but then accepted the post as the next chairman of the Republican National Committee.
In his letter of resignation, Mr. Cavazos said he was especially proud of his contributions "promoting the executive order on excellence in education for Hispanic Americans and raising awareness of the growing diversity of America's student population."
White House officials seemed taken aback by Mr. Cavazos's wounded attitude.
The officials said that possible replacements besides Mr. Kean and Mr. Alexander, included Lynn Martin and Patricia Saiki, the defeated Republican Senate candidates in Illinois and Hawaii, would also be thrown into the mix. David Kearns, a business executive, has also been mentioned as a prospect who would infuse education with the principles of the marketplace.

HEADLINE: MIXED-INCOME HOUSING IN NEW JERSEY;
Big Hoboken Project Back on Track

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J.

 BODY:
Four years after it was announced and then ran into a number of problems, an ambitious plan to construct more than 400 apartments here for families of varying incomes is back on track. But instead of building a single project on one site, as orginally conceived, the sponsor will deliver the housing in two developments on three parcels.
In January, 115 of the apartments will be ready for occupancy in Observer Park. The 12-story tower is rising on the corner of Bloomfield Street and Observer Highway in the southern half of this mile-square port city on the Hudson River, opposite Manhattan. It will be followed by Hudson Square North, a 12-story, 150-unit building under construction on Third Street, between Hudson and River Streets. Twenty percent of the units in both buildings will be set aside for low-income households, with Hoboken families getting preference. 
 The third project, called Hudson Square South and in the planning stage, will also contain 150 units. All three are being built by the Applied Companies, a local developer. The architect is Becher & Wolczynzki of East Hanover, N.J.
The projects are welcomed by Hoboken, where housing development, rapid until a few years ago, has slowed considerably. "They provide much-needed affordable housing and show that the city continues to hold appeal as a residential market," said Peggy E. Thomas, director of the Community Development Agency.
Ms. Thomas was referring to the rejection by voters this summer of the 3.2-million-square-foot project planned by the city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for 32 acres of Hoboken's crumbling waterfront. It would have included offices, stores, a park and apartments.
The housing developments will also bring revenue to the financially pressed city. Ms. Thomas said that when they were completed, the first two projects -- financed through state, Federal, county and private funds -- would generate taxes of $676,502 a year.
Delivering the units, however, proved to be a formidable task. In 1986, Applied contracted with the city to transform a rundown site, made up of three major parcels along Observer Highway, into a mixed-income housing project. It was to contain 450 residences in five mid-rise and high-rise buildings, as well as a park.
But homeowners in the neighborhood opposed the project, saying its height and density would destroy the character of the area. They sued the city, contending that its redevelopment plan was arbitrary and capricious. Ultimately the lawsuit, which was redirected to the scaled-down Observer Prk project, was decided in favor of the developer.
A further problem was the finding of mercury and lead on the tract, rendering it too costly to develop, and the project was shelved. Only the site of the current Observer Park project was salvaged, said Joseph Barry, president of Applied, noting that it has been cleared of contaminants. He said the cleanup had cost $350,000.
In addition, the company's joint- venture partner at the time -- Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus -- pulled out of the project. Nonetheless, Mr. Barry said he had renegotiated with the Hoboken City Council to redevelop for housing the current Observer Park site as well as two vacant parcels on River Street.
Mr. Barry said he did so because he felt there was a strong need for such housing and that if priced correctly, the units could be easily rented. Applied paid the city $6.1 million for the three sites, which Mr. Barry described as prime because they are near PATH, train and bus depots.
New Jersey is still saddled with a large stock of new and existing for-sale housing. But the rental market is brisk because an increasing number of people, concerned about the nation's uncertain economy, are choosing to rent rather than buy.
"Right now, there is a stronger rental than selling market in Hoboken," said Alice Galmann, a partner in Singleton/Galmann Real Estate, a local realty company. Monthly rents in Hoboken range from $800 to $1,000 for one-bedroom apartments and from slightly more than $1,000 to $1,300 for two-bedroom apartments, with some as high as $1,800, she said.
Market-rate apartments at Observer Park will rent for $850 to $995 a month for a 625-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment, and for $1,400 to $1,600 a month for a 1,100-square-foot, three-bedroom unit. Mr. Barry said all but six units had been rented, most of them to people commuting to Manhattan.
At Hudson Square North, where the one- to three-bedroom units will be larger, rents are expected to be slightly higher. Mr. Barry said completion of that project is set for next October. The apartments reserved for families with low incomes in both buildings will rent for $220 to $320 a month.
Mr. Barry said the third project might be a luxury rental. But that decision, he added, hinges on the market and the availability of sewers. At present there is a state-imposed moratorium on sewer hookups until Hoboken expands its treatment plant. The two buildings under construction are exempt because they contain affordable units.

German Utility Agrees To Buy Vista Chemical

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Germany's largest electric utility, RWE A.G., agreed yesterday to pay $55 a share, or a total of $590 million, for the Vista Chemical Company in the latest takeover of an American chemical company by a foreign industrial giant.
Vista's shares more than doubled on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $28.75, to close at $53.75. Its volume of 2.1 million shares traded was the second highest of the day. 
 The agreement "was consummated on an entirely friendly basis," Vista's chairman and president, John D. Burns, said in a statement.
The German company's RWE-DEA A.G. division said it planned to start a tender offer for the Houston-based Vista by next Wednesday. RWE-DEA said the tender is expected to be completed by early 1991 and the merger wrapped up on July 1. It said the tender would be conditioned on receipt of at least two-thirds of Vista's shares.
RWE-DEA said that Vista could end the merger agreement if it received a better offer but that if Vista found another buyer, it would pay RWE-DEA $29 million.
RWE-DEA's bid was undoubtedly strengthened by the depressed state of the dollar, with the United States currency dropping this week to an all-time low of 1.4630 German marks.
The deal follows other acquisitions of United States chemical makers by foreign companies. In the late 1980's, Hoechst A.G. of Germany bought the New York-based Celanese Corporation for almost $3 billion in a deal that created the world's biggest chemical maker.
Germany's BASF A.G. also bought the Inmont Corporation, the nation's largest maker of printing and packaging inks, from the United Technologies Corporation in a $1 billion deal. Among other acquisitions, Imperial Chemical Industries of Britain bought Glidden's coating and resin business for about $600 million and last year, Elf Aquitaine, the French oil and chemical giant, bought the Pennwalt Corporation for $1.1 billion.
Vista is a leading producer of specialty chemicals used in cosmetics, automobile interior trim, printing inks, vinyl pipe and sidings.
Industry analysts say that an investment in Vista is a bet on the prices of polyvinyl chloride, a versatile plastic used mostly in the building and construction market. They estimate that a one-cent-a-pound change in the price of polyvinyl chloride has a 45-cent-a-share impact on Vista's bottom line.
The slowing United States economy, which is hurting the construction industry, is expected to dampen demand for polyvinyl chloride prices in the next couple of years.

On Hustings, Not a Hopeful in Sight

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., Dec. 7

 BODY:
Sitting in her lace-curtained parlor, Mary Lou ise Hancock opened one of three "Presidential Primary" photo albums and smiled wistfully at her snapshots of Albert, Jesse, Michael and Gary.
"I haven't heard a word from anyone this year, not even Albert," said Ms. Hancock, a 70-year-old Democrat. Senator Al Gore used to be a regular visitor to Concord, along with Jesse Jackson, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Gary Hart. "I guess I'll just have to wait and see who sends a Christmas card." 
 In years past, New Hampshire has been besieged by hopefuls eager to make early inroads in the nation's first primary. But this year things are different.
No campaign office space has been reserved on Concord's Main Street. No post office boxes or telephone numbers ending in 1992 have been set aside. Ned Helms, chairman of the State Democratic Party, cannot find a speaker for the party's major fund-raising event in February. And Ms. Hancock, whose parlor meetings have become a rite of passage for Democratic contenders, has yet to hear a peep.
Across the political aisle, things are quiet too. "I haven't heard a thing, and I don't think anyone else has either," said Thomas Rath, an influential Republican.
The Presidential campaign, overshadowed by the Persian Gulf crisis and the recent midterm elections, is getting a late start here as well as other early stops on the trail. That may come as a relief to some, but in New Hampshire eyes are looking south for signs of 1992.
Much of the interest has to do with egotism and entertainment. Since 1952, when the state initiated direct voting for candidates in its Presidential primary, every President from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George Bush has begun the march to Washington with a winter victory in New Hampshire.
So voters in this largely Republican state expect to be courted. In the past, lesser-known candidates would have already begun that ritual.
Having lost his party's nomination in 1968, Senator George S. McGovern began visiting New Hampshire a year later. By June 1970, he had already hired a campaign staff and was busy shaking hands. (He finished second to Senator Edmund S. Muskie in the 1972 primary, but his surprising showing helped propel him to the Democratic nomination.)
Another early starter was Jimmy Carter, who arrived here more than two years before the 1976 primary. "I can remember seeing him on the Statehouse steps and thinking, 'What does he think he's doing?' " said Robert Ambrose, Deputy Secretary of State. In 1986 former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona informally began his Democratic Presidential campaign by climbing Mount Washington, the highest mountain in the Northeast.
"We love it," Mr. Rath said. "So I say: 'Come on up. We have bean suppers, Jell-O molds and chicken dinners galore.' "
But this year, local officials note that the primary will mean more than just a flood of attention. Despite its normally stable economy, New Hampshire has been hit by recession, like the rest of New England, and it could use some money.
The state now leads the nation in the rate of delinquent consumer loans (6.12 percent). In Concord, the unemployment rate has more than doubled since 1988 and now stands at 5.5 percent.
At the Eagle Court Restaurant, where David H. Souter often had lunch before he moved on to the Supreme Court, business has dropped by 25 percent since last year. Two waitresses, three waiters and a bartender have been laid off.
Patronage by candidates, their entourages and swarms of reporters and broadcast crews means a flood of revenue for the Eagle Court and other businesses. "These Presidential elections can be kind of a pain, but they are definitely good for business," said James Makris, who owns the restaurant with his brother, Gregory. "We would welcome any kind of help at this point."
A real estate broker, Claudia Boys of the Corrigan Company, said: "The activity is short-term, and not always easy on the space. But we will welcome the new tenants."
James Smith, Concord's City Manager, agreed. "Given the current economy," he said, "we'd look forward to seeing anyone."

D.M.B.&B. Plans to Create An Agency Network in Asia

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
D'ARCY MASIUS BENTON & BOWLES is expected to announce today the creation of a broad network of agencies in Asia.
D.M.B.&B.'s move comes as an increasing number of international agencies are scrambling to establish strong networks in Asia. Many industry executives believe that parts of Asia are fast becoming among the leading areas for advertising growth and will rival Europe within the next few years. 
 "Southeast Asia has been relatively untapped compared to the United States and Europe," said John Ferries, the president of D.M.B.&B./ International. "But we're aggressively expanding there because of the area's remarkable growth in terms of a middle-class consumer market and the rapidly growing availabilty of television and other media."
Several international agencies, including McCann-Erickson, Ogilvy & Mather, J. Walter Thompson and Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, have a fairly strong presence in the region.
Carl Spielvogel, the chairman and chief executive of B.S.B., which has one of the largest agency networks in Asia, said the strongest emerging consumer markets were in Thailand, Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan. This year, B.S.B.'s Asia operatons have added about $150 million in billings. In 1989, the agency's Asian network had billings of about $750 million, or 27 percent of its billings outside the United States.
Many agencies are expanding their networks in Asia. Burt Manning, the chairman and chief executive of J. Walter Thompson, said the agency was quickly adding staff there. "Singapore is our hottest office," he said.
Mr. Manning said a primary reason for rising growth was that governments in the region were encouraging American companies to make investments in local economies.
And as clients increase their business in Asia, it is only logical that agencies would also push into the region as well. Mr. Ferries said many of D.M.B.&B.'s leading clients, like Procter & Gamble, were concentrating more heavily on business in Asia. "Our clients are making massive commitments of money and manpower in the region and so it's only natural that we would, too," he said.
In addition, Mr. Spielvogel said companies based in Asia were seeking American agencies to help them expand into other regions. "We're helping a lot of our clients there prepare to enter into the European marketplace," he said.
In expanding its Asian network, D.M.B.&B. has acquired substantial equity positions in agencies in Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia, and has formed joint-venture partnerships in India and Pakistan.
The agency is also negotiating to set up offices in China and Taiwan. Mr. Ferries said the agency had decided to open an office in China because some of its clients were quietly beginning to do business there again.
D.M.B.&B. already has offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan. The agency has billings of about $100 million from is Asia operations.
At its offices in Singapore and Thailand, D.M.B.&B. has entered into an equity partnership with Tokyu Agency International, which is its partner in Japan. This is one of the few deals in which Japanese and American agencies have become equity partners in an agency outside their countries.
As advertising growth in the United States continues to slow, international agencies are increasingly looking for opportunities elsewhere. Mr. Ferries predicted that South America would be the next region for growth in the coming years. "We're seeing a lot of stability in terms of the governments and economies in South America," he said. "It will be the next frontier, but the boom is probably a few years off."

Hurt by Recession Fears, Silver Closes Just Over $4

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The price of silver traded below $4 an ounce yesterday, hitting its lowest level in 14 years as fears mounted that a recession would deeply cut industrial demand for the metal.
The metal recovered somewhat to close above $4, but still finished lower for the day. 
 "The problem with silver is that it's being hurt by changing expectations that the U.S. recession will be deeper and longer than what had been expected only two months ago," said Jeffrey Nichols of American Precious Metals Advisors, Florida-based investment consultants.
In trading yesterday, spot silver on the New York Commodity Exchange fell 5.6 cents, to $3.97 an ounce, the low for the day and its lowest point since Feb. 10, 1976, when silver closed at $3.93 an ounce. The contract regained some of that loss, however, to close off 2 cents at $4.006.
In other precious metals trading, gold for December delivery on the Comex rose $1.60, to $374.30 an ounce, in typically slow year-end dealings.
Analysts said silver was a metal with a double personality, being both a precious metal and an industrial metal, and the concern was that the recession would mean less silver demanded by industry.
"Silver inventories on the Comex are bulging, and they're just coming out of a record high in October of 265 million ounces," said Don Tierney of Fortune Commodities, traders on the Comex. Yesterday, Comex silver stocks stood at 259 million ounces.
Worldwide production of 530 million ounces of silver this year is also overshooting an estimated industrial demand of 486 million ounces, analysts said.
Silver's chronic oversupply was highlighted in a recent research study that said world stocks were equal to 2.35 years worth of industrial consumption.
But the big drag on prices right now is the prospect of a bad economic recession, the analysts said.
Silver's major uses, for photography and solder, stand to suffer from a recession. The photographic industry consumes about 45 percent of all silver mined in the world. Mexico and Peru, both heavily indebted nations, are major producers.
Analysts said silver had also lost its appeal as an investment asset.
"There's a large overhang of silver held by disgruntled investors who bought in the 1970's and 1980's and they're tired of holding the silver," one analyst said.
"Whenever prices go up a little, there are some investors who are keen to sell, afraid that it may be their last chance to make a profit," he added. "Others will sell in a declining market because they fear that silver will go down even further."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
Controlling Oil's 2 Great Threats

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AT the reunion in Vienna this week of the 13 members of OPEC, with the Iraqi and Kuwaiti representatives sitting grimly next to each other as the alphabet dictated, agreement was reached to restore OPEC's pre-invasion production limit of 22.5 million barrels a day and to reaffirm the target price of about $21 a barrel once the Persian Gulf crisis is over. And while the meeting was going on, the price of oil fell to $25.35 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 3, the day after the invasion began. Though it rose yesterday, to $26.42, that is still nearly $15 below the Oct. 10 peak of $41.15.
Does the market know something the rest of us do not -- that there will be no war? No one can be sure. Administration spokesmen stress the importance of destroying the power of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to dominate the oil market and destabilize the American and world economies. As President Bush put the case two weeks after the invasion: "Our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the world would all suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell into the hands of Saddam Hussein."
Oil evidently remains a powerful cause of war, as it has been throughout modern history. "The fierce and sometimes violent quest for oil -- and for the riches and power it conveys -- will surely continue so long as oil holds a central place," says Daniel Yergin in his new book, "The Prize."
And Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Distinguished Professor of Economics Emeritus at Vanderbilt University, who was raised in Romania, writes: "I happened to live through three wars, all in my backyard." The basic cause of "every one of those wars," he says, "stemmed from the fact that at those times Romania had immense oil reserves which none of the belligerent powers wanted to letfall into the hands of its adversary."
The aggressions of Iraq against Iran, then Kuwait and its threat to Saudi Arabia, and the blocking action of other nations are just the latest episodes in what Professor Georgescu-Roegen calls "the indissoluble binding of grand politics with mineral resources."
But another problem has emerged to complicate the politics and economics of oil -- the threat to the environment and human life. This week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna focused, for the first time, on plans under way in Western Europe for curbing the use of oil to help reduce pollution by 1992. Calling the issue "a serious challenge," a Saudi official said OPEC would direct its economists to study the environmental concerns of Western Europe and the effect they might have on the consumption of crude oil and refined products.
OPEC is naive to think the environmental "challenge" will come only from Western Europe. Eastern Europe, after decades of Communism, is even more polluted. Indeed, the threat of pollution from hydrocarbons is global, affecting rich and poor countries alike -- not excepting OPEC members.
Solutions to both poisonous mixtures -- oil andthe environment, and oil, money and power -- will depend on two key factors: new technology to reduce dependence on oil, and conservation. And there is no quick fix for either one.
Professor Georgescu-Roegen says that during the entire life of the human species, there have been only two viable technologies. The first he calls Prometheus I, based on the mastery of fire, the legendary gift of the Greek god Prometheus. Its fuel was wood.
But as consumption accelerated and the forests began to disappear in the latter part of the 17th century, there was a "crisis of wood," in his words. This crisis was solved by two mortals, Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen, who invented the heat engine; this was Prometheus II, based chiefly on coal, then oil.
"The problem now," says Professor Georgescu-Roegen, "is whether and when a Prometheus III will come to get us out of the present muddle." No one knows for sure. Meanwhile, the best strategy is to gain as much lead time as possible, and the way to do that is through conservation -- "a conservation compatible with an acceptable survival of all humanity, without ignoring the needed development of those nations that are now in economic and social distress."
Conservation, whether used to lessen dependency on oil from a highly troubled and explosive region or to combat the threat to the environment, cannot be the job of one nation or a few but must be the job of virtually all nations working together.
Yet a nation seeking to protect its own economy and security can still benefit greatly from conservation on its own. A dramatic example is Japan, completely dependent on imported oil, which after the oil shocks of the 1970's drastically cut its use of energy while maintaining the highest rate of economic growth in the world. Japan's per capita energy consumption is now just two-fifths that of the United States.
A combination of high energy taxes on consumers and strong financial incentives to industry to develop and use energy-efficient equipment made the difference.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fell 0.1% Last Month

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Retail sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in November, the Commerce Department said today, as consumers pinched spending at the start of the key Christmas selling season.
Much of the weakness was in automobiles, where consumers have been cautious about making large purchases. But even without the weak automobile sector, November sales rose an anemic two-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The monthly decline was the first drop since May, when sales also fell one-tenth of 1 percent, and it was notable because the holiday shopping season usually takes off in the last weeks of November.
"While the market was expecting a weaker number, this report is hardly good news," said Charles Lieberman, an economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation.
Economists, surveying the weak economy, had expected a six-tenths of 1 percent drop in retail sales, which cover goods and services ranging from furniture to autos to restaurant meals. But they found little solace in the fact that sales turned down only slightly after a revised two-tenths of 1 percent rise in October.
 
Shoppers Remain Cautious
 Several analysts say the report suggests that shoppers will continue to be cautious and that the holiday season will be grim for retailers.
The nation's auto makers reported a 22 percent jump in vehicle sales in early December, helped by rebates and deliveries to rental fleets. But the rise was deceptively large because sales a year ago were very weak. One automotive analyst said demand for cars and light trucks remained "very depressed." [Page D6.]
In the wake of the retail sales report, Mr. Lieberman said he expected the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates again after its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets on Monday.
General merchandise store sales, which usually get a strong lift from Christmas shoppers, fell four-tenths of 1 percent from the October level.
The overall decline last month left retail sales at a seasonally adjusted $151.6 billion.
Auto dealer sales fell by 1.3 percent in November after a 1.4 percent increase in October. Large car makers, including the General Motors Corporation, have announced sharp production cutbacks because of falling sales.
Gasoline dealer sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent last month after rises of 2.6 percent in October and 5.6 percent in September, showing that the gasoline price rises are moderating.
 
Durable Goods Sales Drop 1.4%
 Sales of durable goods, items meant to last three or more years, fell 1.4 percent in November after increasing six-tenths of 1 percent in October. Sales of nondurable goods, such as food and disposable items, gained five-tenths of 1 percent in November after a flat October.
Sluggish spending by consumers, who buy about two-thirds of all the goods and services produced in the economy, was hardly a surprise. Worries have been rising steadily about unemployment and the possibility of war in the Middle East.
The Labor Department said last Friday that 267,000 jobs were lost in November and 178,000 were lost in October, removing most doubts that the economy was in recession.
A recession is usually defined as six months of shrinking economic output, a condition the United States has not experienced since 1981-82.
 
Clothing Sales Rise
 In other sectors, clothing store sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in November after a three-tenths of 1 percent fall in October.
Food store sales gained five-tenths of 1 percent after a one-tenth of 1 percent decrease in October, while drugstore sales rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month after rising five-tenths of 1 percent in October.
Furniture store sales increased three-tenths of 1 percent in November after a five-tenths of 1 percent drop in October.

HEADLINE: Builders May Be Forced to Pay for Low-Cost Housing

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

 BODY:
The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled yesterday that municipalities may charge fees to developers to pay for affordable housing programs mandated by the state.
Seventy-five towns in New Jersey have adopted ordinances requiring such fees to help pay for housing programs satisfying the state court's series of Mount Laurel rulings, which require all municipalities to provide housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income families. 
 But lower courts blocked the fees, agreeing with developers who had argued that they were unauthorized taxes on a selectgroup of individuals.
The New Jersey court and courts in other states including California, Florida, Illinois and Wisconsin had previously upheld laws requiring builders to pay the cost of improvements to roads, sewers and water systems required by their commercial or housing developments.
But to protect developers from unreasonable charges, those rulings required a direct link between the project and the needed improvements.
In the opinion written by Justice Alan B. Handler, the New Jersey court said yesterday that it was not necessary to apply such a rigid test when considering the validity ofthe fees.
"It is fair and reasonable to impose such fee requirements on private developers when they possess, enjoy and consume land, which constitutes the primary resource for housing," the court said.
Programs have been initiated in Boston, San Francisco and elsewhere to require commercial developers to contribute to an affordable housing trust fund or build some affordable housing units themselves.
New Jersey is still the only state where communities have a constitutional obligation to provide affordable housing, because of the Mount Laurel decisions, building industry experts said. The decisions took the name of Mount Laurel, the first town whose exclusionary zoning was struck down by the court.
The lawyer for the developers, Henry A. Hill, called the opinion "a shock and a disappointment."
He said it could expose the state's building industry to more than $3 billion in fees in the future to help build or rehabilitate the 160,000 affordable housing units that the state has estimated will be needed in the next six years.
"The ruling lays out an elaborate means of opening the pocketbook of the building industry to finance the court's Mount Laurel opinions," he said.
While they lost their constitutional challenge to the imposition of the fees, the developers will be able to recover the money that they have already paid. The court overturned the ordinances already adopted because no standards for their enactment had been established by the Council on Affordable Housing, which was created by the 1985 Fair Housing Act to insure that each municipality meets its affordable housing obligation.
Mr. Hill said the developers should recover about $30 million already collected by the towns. But in light of the future impact of the ruling, he added, "It looks like we won the battle but lost the war."
He said if the Council on Affordable Housing does not set up a model fee ordinance "with some sensitivity to the economic conditions in the industry, the consequences could be devastating."
 
'Intervening Step'
 Mr. Hill; Thomas V. O'Neil, spokesman for the New Jersey chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Parks, and Patrick J. O'Keefe, the executive vice president of the New Jersey Builders Association, say towns will not be able to reclaim the money they return after they adopt new ordinances. "There is an intervening step," Mr. O'Keefe said, referring to the adoption of regulations by the housing council. "After this hiatus the towns can adopt ordinances that will only affect future projects."
The fees that will now have to be returned were collected by the towns in different ways. Some made the fee -- based on the size of the project or its overall cost -- a condition of receiving approval for a commercial or housing development that did not include some low-priced units. Others gave housing builders a choice of including affordable units in their proposed developments or making a payment to the trust fund. Still others simply imposed a mandatory fee on all developments of a certain size.
The towns put the money into local affordable housing trust funds for the purpose of rehabilitating existing housing for sale to low-income families, building new affordable housing, subsidizing efforts by nonprofit groups to provide housing or paying nearby towns to accept responsibility for some of their allotted number of low-income housing units.
 
Voluntary Agreements
 The suits filed by developers against the Townships of Cherry Hill, Chester, Holmdel, Middletown and South Brunswick forced the funds everywhere to be held in escrow.
A spokeswoman for the Council on Affordable Housing, Sidna Mitchell, said the council in the past had given towns permission to enter into voluntary agreements with builders to produce revenue for low-income housing. Developers who wanted to build more units per acre than allowed under zoning ordinances were given a choice -- sell some of the extra units at reduced prices or pay a fee for the increased building density.
She said lawyers for the council would have to examine yesterday's ruling closely to see if affected the validity of such negotiated agreements.
In yesterday's opinion, the court rejected arguments by developers that the ordinances establishing the fees had violated constitutional standards covering the taking of property, due process and equal protection. But it did not discuss the question of whether ordinances that exacted fees without giving developers something in return were valid, since the ordinances were all struck down. Mr. O'Neil said that if future ordinances did not allow builders some benefit in return for paying an affordable housing fee there probably would be further litigation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Slight Gains, Mainly on Technical Factors

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar firmed slightly against major foreign currencies yesterday in sleepy pre-holiday trading that largely took its cue from technical factors.
The thinly traded currency market seemed unmotivated by external influences that brisker sessions typically take into consideration. 
 Traders said there was no market reaction to a Government report of retail sales falling one-tenth of 1 percent in November, the first decline in six months. While news of economic troubles generally drive down the dollar's value against foreign currencies, traders said the continuing prospect for war in the Persian Gulf kept them cautiously bullish.
 
Stronger Against the Yen
 War news has particularly strengthened the dollar against the Japanese yen because Japan's economy is so dependent on imported oil.
"You have two situations going against each other: Someone could make a warlike statement, and that will pop the dollar up," said Thomas J. Palladino, a trader at Osterreichische Landerbank.
"People are a little afraid of taking a position one way or another," he added.
Likewise, traders said the market was not affected by the Bundesbank's regular meeting yesterday, which left German interest rates unchanged.
 
Rumors Brushed Aside
 The market also brushed aside rumors, later proved untrue, that the planned meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had been canceled.
The dollar gained against the yen in New York, closing at 132.17 yen, up from 131.45 late Wednesday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 131.30 yen, from 131.88 at Wednesday's close, and later in London, it rose to 132.25 yen.
The dollar also gained against the British pound in New York, with the pound weakening to $1.9450, from late Wednesday's $1.9502. In London, the pound rose to $1.9440, from $1.9435 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's prices, included: 1.4790 German marks, up from 1.4756; 1.2660 Swiss francs, up from 1.2610; 5.0255 French francs, up from 5.0120; 1,115.25 Italian lire, up from 1,112.00, and 1.1607 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1606.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Note and Bond Prices Down

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Stronger-than-expected reports on the economy and a rise in oil prices acted as catalysts for a sell-off yesterday in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds and a jump in interest rates.
Despite the small rise in interest rates, an auction of $26 billion worth of new one-year Treasury bills produced the lowest rate on those securities in more than two years. 
 Retail sales figures for November were weak, showing that sales dipped one-tenth of a percentage point, but they were not as weak as many analysts had forecast. And auto sales for the first 10 days of December, at an annualized 6.5 million units, were much stronger than anticipated. Although that was still below the annual rate for the year so far, it was much higher than for the last 10 days of November, when auto makers sold 5.3 million units at an annual rate.
In addition, news reports that appeared throughout the day made it appear that the tenuous peace process in the Persian Gulf was in jeopardy. Those reports in turn helped to push up oil prices.
"The economic numbers allowed people to shift the focus back to the Middle East, where we still have problems," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. "Combine that with a little bit of profit-taking and we were ripe for some sort of sell-off."
William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, said "the market is coming into the end of December in a very overbought situation. That heightens the desire to take profits now, because activity is likely to thin out in the next week or so."Run-Up in Oil Prices
The run-up in oil prices and the economic numbers helped to push down bond prices. And a move by the Federal Reserve Board to drain reserves from the banking system, a step analysts said was another clear signal the central bank has not yet lowered its target on the overnight Federal funds rate from 7.25 percent, helped to depress short-term notes and bills.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 107 2/32, down half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.11 percent. Late Wednesday the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.05 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 22/ 32, down 10/32, to yield 7.95 percent. And the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 6/32, down 3/32, to yield 7.26 percent.
At an auction of one-year Treasury bills, the securities were sold at an average discount rate of 6.58 percent, down sharply from the average 6.81 percent rate on one-year bills sold at the last auction on Nov. 15. It is the lowest rate on a one-year bill since the auction of April 6, 1988.
In the secondary market for Treasury bills, three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 6.82 percent, up five basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.68 percent. And one-year bills were offered at a late rate of 6.59 percent, up six basis points.
 
Investment-Grade Bond Market
 A number of issues were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market yesterday, including a $500 million offering of securities backed by credit card receipts from a financing vehicle created by the Chase Manhattan Bank.
The 8.55 percent securities, which have an average life of 3.5 years, were priced at $99.737, to yield 8.680 percent, 1.19 percentage points over the blended, or interpolated, rate of the 7 3/4 percent three-year Treasury notes and the 8 1/2 percent four-year Treasury notes.
The securities, backed by an 11 percent letter of credit from the Union Bank of Switzerland, are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Chase Securities Inc. acted as lead manager for the underwriting.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, strong demand for certain segments of a $1.1 billion offering of taxable and tax-exempt New York City securities forced underwriters to lower yields on some bonds. The maximum yield on taxable bonds, which stood at 8.55 percent on a preliminary basis on Wednesday, was lowered to 8.50 percent for 30-year bonds.
The issue was not yet freed up to trade, municipal market participants said.
In the secondary market for municipal bonds, traders said prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to down 1/8 of a point.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most issues rose by about 1/8 of a point, traders said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell sharply during the week ended Dec. 3.
The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DECISION: SUSTAINING THE SOVIETS;
Russians Divided on Whether Donations Of Food Will Help or Hurt in the Long Run

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In the northern Russian village of Shulepovo the other day, a tractor driver named Andrei Kuzmin downed a jolt of vodka and emphatically announced his opinion of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's appeals for emergency aid from the West.
 "You tell America, don't give those Communists a kopeck!" roared Mr. Kuzmin, certain that his poor rural settlement will not see a morsel of the gifts. "They're bandits!" 
 Mr. Gorbachev's low-key solicitation of assistance to help his country through a lean winter has found remarkable sympathy abroad, reaching an improbable peak today in a promise of food shipments from India.
 
Helping or Hurting Reform?
 But this rush of generosity has caused considerable division here at the receiving end, among economists and politicians, foreign diplomats and ordinary citizens like Mr. Kuzmin.
 Supporters say deliveries of food and medicine, even if the amounts are largely symbolic, will ease hardship for some residents and by calming panic will help fortify Mr. Gorbachev for the continuation of his reforms.
Skeptics say that at best the relief will provide fleeting comfort to a few of the poor, and that at worst the West may find itself killing Soviet reform with kindness.
By most accounts the flow of foreign aid is more political than humanitarian, a gesture of support from Western governments and publics for the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and for his promises of democracy and free markets.
 
Wheat Coming From India
 India's Ambassador to Moscow today announced gifts to the Soviets of food and medicines, plus a million-ton wheat sale on favorable terms, to add to the food, credit agreements and other aid pledged by governments and organizations around the world.
But the relief effort that has been mounted would not come close to remedying a real famine, if one materialized. Lev A. Voronin, who heads a central Government commission on aid distribution, said the 1,700 tons of total foreign food deliveries so far sound impressive until they are put in context: Moscow residents alone consume 4,200 tons of meat every day.
For Mr. Gorbachev, the ability to deliver Western food aid is a chance to justify his diplomatic globetrotting, which some of his constituents have come to see as a distraction from their own hurts. It is also an answer to critics who complain he has traded away Soviet military might for little return.
Tonight, Tass hailed President Bush's decision Wednesday to authorize up to $1 billion in farm credits to Moscow as a particular triumph for Mr. Gorbachev's foreign policy, saying, "Its political and economic significance must not be underestimated."
"Politically, it is important that Washington's 16-year taboo on credits to the Soviet Union is practically annulled and also that the United States has arrived at the conclusion that the renewal processes in Soviet society are now irreversible," the official press agency said.
The American credit, though modest, is a political plum for the Kremlin because Mr. Bush had earlier vowed that no such assistance would be given until the Soviet Union enacts a law on free emigration.
That law has languished for a year in Parliament, resisted by government agencies that fear a mass exodus of capital and expertise once emigration limits are lifted.
 
Little Public Good Will
 So far there is no evidence the aid shipments have won Mr. Gorbachev the good will of his own public.
On the contrary, many Soviets see the television reports of charity food arriving in Moscow as the latest indictment of a system -- and specifically Mr. Gorbachev's five years of economic experiments -- that let food supplies decline.
The flow of Western aid carries several risks for Mr. Gorbachev, as well as for the donors.
One is that if a significant amount of the aid is diverted into the black market, it will deepen the morass of disenchantment and cynicism, undermining the leader it was intended to help.
Recalling the experience of the Armenian earthquake two years ago, when Western clothing and food relief were seen being sold flagrantly in Moscow bazaars, both Western donors and the Soviets themselves have stressed the need for meticulous monitoring.
 Even if these efforts are largely successful, however, it seems certain that aid will reach only a small portion of the hardship cases in this vast country. And when it runs out, their bitterness could return redoubled.
A second danger, some critics say, is that aid may provide an excuse to postpone needed economic change.
In a forthcoming book called "The Anti-Communist Manifesto: Whom to Help in Russia," six Soviet scholars urge the West to withhold any aid to the Soviet Union that might prop up the existing industrial and farm monopolies and thus postpone the development of truly private enterprise.
"Even grain sales to the U.S.S.R. contribute to the preservation of this parasitic system," wrote Larisa Piyasheva, an independent market economist.
A senior Western diplomat today countered that credits like those offered by Mr. Bush would give Moscow temporary flexibility in its foreign purchases, but would have to be paid back within three years.
"If they don't make the hard choices, it's not going to be because of aid," the diplomat add. "There is not that much aid."
 
Political Exploitation Feared
 A third hazard is that aid could become a weapon in the country's internal political wars.
Insurgents who have won control of local governments in Moscow and other cities worry that Western largesse will become the personal patronage of Mr. Gorbachev, the Communist Party or the K.G.B., which is proudly flaunting its new role of policing food distribution.
Western embassies say they cannot bypass the central Government, with which they have diplomatic relations. But they have urged that assistance be channeled through popularly elected officials rather than the party or the K.G.B.
"If the central Government says it wants to use its police to make sure Western aid doesn't get stolen, it's kind of hard to object to that," a diplomat said. "If the K.G.B. is taking control of transport and delivery, that would be a little harder to deal with."
One group of hard-liners, a political alliance called the Centrist Bloc, tried this week to use the aid against Mr. Gorbachev, condemning the Soviet leader for "presenting the Soviet Union as a beggar country."
 
Willing to Swallow Pride
 Most consumers, however, are by now willing to swallow their pride and accept foreign help.
"The real humiliation of our country comes from the people who, over the years, reduced things to such a state that what we produce is either destroyed or rots in the fields," the Government daily Izvestia said tonight.
One diplomat said the greatest risk of all in the current frenzy over Soviet food supplies is the danger that Western sympathy will be spent by the time it is needed.
"If this spiral of deterioration continues, by next winter the wolf may really be at the door," he said. "One hopes that if that is the case, they haven't cried 'wolf' too often."

HEADLINE: Honda's New Wagon: A U.S. Auto, Almost

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARYSVILLE, Ohio, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Honda Motor Company introduced a station wagon today that represents another step in the Japanese company's drive to become the first foreign company to create a self-sufficient United States auto maker.
The Accord station wagon is the first Honda to be designed and assembled completely in this country, although some components are imported from Japan. It was designed at the company's studios in Torrance, Calif., and is being built at Honda's plant in this city 35 miles northwest of Columbus. "For years we were supporting projects that started in Japan," said Ben Knight, assistant project leader for the station wagon. 
 By the end of this decade, Honda hopes to bring out a car that is not only entirely native-born but that also is not a version of another Honda, as the station wagon is to the Accord sedan. Honda says its goal is to respond more quickly and accurately to the desires of United States buyers.
Honda's new station wagon, which went into production Nov. 20 and has begun arriving at dealers, is one of a breed that has largely been replaced by mini-vans. The company thinks it will be strong competition for station-wagon versions of the Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable, Toyota Camry and Volvo.
In a more philosophical vein, the Accord wagon poses a challenge for American politicians, auto executives and scholars who argue that the Japanese auto industry is advancing at the expense of the domestic industry and thereby weakening United States economic competitiveness.
Because it relies on American assemblers, engineers, designers and parts suppliers, and because it will be exported to Europe and Japan, the new vehicle can be viewed as an asset to the American economy and a way to reduce the nation's trade deficit.
What is more, building the car entirely in the United States has required Honda to teach its United States employees, most of whom are Americans, sophisticated engineering and manufacturing skills that in the past were not needed at Japanese plants in the United States, which ported many parts and merely assembled them. (Nissan and Toyota are moving in the same direction.)
Among the skills: building robotic assembly machines and designing a tool and die system to build the eight large metal panels that differentiate the station wagon from the sedan.
"Our dies can stamp out a piece of metal in four motions of the press, as opposed to six or seven motions by the presses of many other auto makers," explained James Macaluso, 32 years old, who has worked for Honda for nine years. The highly efficient tool-and-die technology comes from Honda's Japanese operations but it must be learned and carried out by Americans.
 
Public Relations Move?
 Some scholars argue that improving workers' skills helps make the United States more competitive. But many see Honda's efforts as little more than a public relations exercise. They argue that Honda exaggerates the portion of the car's components -- about 70 percent -- that come from the United States in order to blunt criticism of its success against the Big Three car makers. For the last two years, the Accord has been the best-selling car in the United States.
Officials from the United Automobile Workers union criticized Honda for trying to create the impression that the company was becoming more American.
"Honda's self-proclaimed Americanization is a myth," said Sheldon Friedman, director of research for the union. "What counts, particularly when it comes to creating jobs, is domestic manufacturing content. By that measure, Honda still falls far short of the Big Three."
Doing the engineering work necessary to transform the Accord sedan into a station wagon is "not a big deal, although it's a good place to start" for Honda's American engineers, said David E. Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation.
"The real test of whether Honda is moving more of its core engineering here would be if the company allows its U.S. operations to do a powertrain," he said, referring to the engine and transmission, which are still designed in Japan.
 
Lack of Engineers
 Honda's decision to do the engineering work on the Accord wagon in the United States stems partly from the difficulty Japanese auto makers have had attracting skilled engineers at home, Mr. Cole said.
"The Japanese auto companies have long been concerned that the industry was not as attractive to the brightest engineers as it once was," he said. "This is, in fact, coming to pass. They are running out of people in Japan."
Station wagons have fallen from a peak of 12.6 percent of all cars registered in the United States in 1973 to 4.3 percent in 1990. Just under 500,000 were sold last year, while mini-van sales last year climbed to 735,000.
While mini-vans have become the station wagons, and even the family sedans, of the 1980's, "that doesn't mean that compact vans are going to kill off the market for station wagons," said Christopher Cedergren, an analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, a marketing research company in Westlake Village, Calif.
In fact, Mr. Cedergren expects a mild resurgence in sales of station wagons. "There is a group that still wants something that looks like a car, and doesn't like the look or the handling of the mini-vans," he said.
 
More Sales Expected
 Indeed, J. D. Power projects that sales of station wagons will begin to climb again, reaching 770,000 by 1995, partly helped by Honda's new entry. Honda expects to sell 30,000 to 35,000 station wagons annually in the United States and to export about 10,000 annually to Europe and Japan.
The price of the Accord wagon will range from $17,300 to $19,800. The Environmental Protection Agency's fuel-efficiency rating for the manual-transmission version is 22 miles a gallon in city driving and 27 in highway driving. The rating for the automatic-transmission model is 20 miles a gallon in the city and 26 on the highway.
Ford executives said they were confident that their Taurus wagon would hold its own. "Honda may take some market share," said Joel Pitcoff, a market analyst for Ford. "But it's only a four-cylinder engine, which I think would limit them." (Ford's Taurus wagon usually carries a six-cylinder engine.)
Mr. Cedergren expects Honda's real challenger to be Toyota's new Camry wagon, which is coming out next fall and is built in Japan.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Parting at Waterford Wedgwood

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In a separation that could either save a four-year marriage or set the stage for dissolution, Waterford Wedgwood P.L.C., the troubled Irish maker of fine tableware, announced today that its crystal and ceramic operations would operate independently from now on.
"Waterford Wedgwood will be very much a holding company now, instead of an operational company," said Robert Davies, its chief financial officer. Mr. Davies, who is heading the reorganization, has also been named acting chief executive of the Wedgwood operations. 
 The company's new structure represents a 180-degree turn away from the strategy that brought the two brands under one roof in 1986, when Waterford Crystal paid more than $360 million for Wedgwood. Then, the idea was to integrate the two operations to streamline production and to use the products' overlapping customer base to strengthen the brands' marketing position.
 
'Better Mix of Markets'
 Analysts say they do not think the new structure necessarily means the merger is unraveling. "I suppose it creates that possibility, though clearly the Waterford side on its own wouldn't be viable," said John Hogan, research director at Riada & Company, an Irish brokerage house. "Somebody might want to buy it and take it private, to take the long view. But I don't see that as the immediate intention."
Instead, analysts say the move is probably in part a way to motivate Wedgwood executives, whose good results have been consistently overshadowed by losses at Waterford.
"Clearly, Wedgwood has proved to be the more robust company," Mr. Hogan said. "Partly I think it's because it has a better mix of markets. Waterford's crystal is heavily dependent on one market, the United States, and on the dollar. So it's producing in Ireland and selling in dollars and only getting half the Irish pounds back. Over the past five years, the exchange rate has halved for the dollar."
Mr. Hogan says the restructuring may also be an attempt to give the crystal business the flexibility it needs to come up with new products, or to cut back on production, as the United States slides into recession.
"This might give them a better, faster reporting structure," he said. "Whoever is in charge of the crystal operation will have a straight line of control from production and distribution to marketing and sales."
The market seemed cautiously optimistic about today's announcement. The company's stock, which is trading at about 37 cents a share, was up slightly.
In a letter sent to shareholders, Howard E. Kilroy, Waterford Wedgwood's chairman, said the internal restructuring "will enable each management, led by its existing executive team, to concentrate on its own brands and pursue the global strategies necessary for their development."
Waterford Wedgwood's chief executive, Paddy Bryne, resigned after saying he supported the reorganization.
 
A Heavy Debt Burden
 The merged company seemed to have problems from the outset. Waterford took on heavy debt to finance the acquisition and has been hobbled by it ever since.
In April 1989, the balance sheet worsened when auditors discovered that the crystal unit's 1988 earnings had been overstated by some $21 million. The division promptly went into the red, overshadowinng the record operating earnings of Wedgwood.
Last year also brought a softening of demand in the company's two biggest markets, the United States and Britain. Waterford Wedgwood sells 70 percent of its crystal in the United States and 44 percent of its china in Britain. Both markets were already showing signs of economic strain; orders from the United States dropped even further because of the consolidation crisis among department stores.
Waterford Wedgwood wound up with a 1989 loss before taxes and interest of $1.7 million on sales of $542 million.
By March 1990, debt stood at $233.7 million, and a rescue plan was mounted by two investor groups, which paid $158.9 million for a 29.9 percent in the company. But the investors -- led by Morgan Stanley & Company and Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, the Irish-born businessman who is also the chairman of the H. J. Heinz Company -- were unable to save the company from another problem that arose the following month: a strike by the 2,100 employees at the Waterford Crystal Works.
The 14-week work stoppage compounded the problem of softening export demand.
Mr. Hogan of Riada & Company estimates that the company's 1990 sales will reach $372.6 million, with a pretax loss of $32.4 million. "I think we got quite a lot out of the merger," he said. "But now we're looking at an economic time of being lean, focused and very accountable."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Newspaper Executives Report on a Difficult Year

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
"Let's not mince words; 1990 has been a simply dreadful year," said Richard D. Simmons, president of The Washington Post Company, as he began his address yesterday to a group of communications industry analysts and reporters in New York.
Representatives of Dow Jones & Company, The New York Times Company and Afflilated Publications Inc. were similarly grim when their turns came to speak yesterday at the Paine Webber Media Forum. The forum is an annual review of the past year's business and a projection of the year to come by many of the nation's largest public communications companies. 
 Indeed, with advertising sales in a nationwide slump, the weeklong forum has consisted mostly of explaining drops in earnings expected for 1990 and projected for 1991. But in every case, the year's poor results were accompanied by expressions of confidence that the basic businesses remained strong and would rebound when the economic climate changed.
While most newspaper-oriented public communications companies have diversified into other businesses like broadcasting, cable and information services, the advertising-sensitive portions of the business remain the largest for most of them.
 
'Straightforward' Approach
 With an audience that includes many of the people who recommend buying, selling or holding media stocks at some of the nation's largest brokerage houses, presenting unhappy tidings in the most positive fashion was a high priority.
Most of the executives making presentations chose a "very straightforward" approach, said J. Kendrick Noble Jr., who is a specialist at evaluating media stocks at Paine Webber and who is the moderator of the forum. He said such frankness suggested to the analyst community that the executives understood their problems and were in command of them.
Mr. Simmons of The Washington Post Company went so far as to apologize to analysts for being too optimistic a year ago. And he presented a detailed account of how the paper's advertising "fell off a cliff" in July, especially help wanted and real estate classified advertising. He blamed cutbacks in the military consulting industry, which is a big Washington employer, and a general recession.
He estimated that the Post Company's earnings for 1990 would decline 8 percent and said that he had an "unusually pessimistic view" of the overall economy, bolstered only by confidence that the Washington economy would be among the first to improve. "But I don't think we've yet hit bottom," he added.
 
Decline at Dow Jones
 Peter R. Kann, the president of Dow Jones, began his company's presentation with an extended explanation of the company's long-term strategy of expansion as a global business news and information company. Next year, Mr. Kann will replace the company's longtime chairman, Warren Phillips, who is retiring, and he said he wished to reassure the analysts that the company's essential vision had not changed.
But eventually, like the other executives making presentations, Mr. Kann had to deliver the bad news: a 30 percent decline in Dow Jones earnings from continuing operations for 1990 compared with 1989.
He said the drop had been prompted by a continuing decline in advertising in The Wall Street Journal and lower sales in the United States operations of the company's electronic financial data company, Telerate.
As for 1991, he said that the company would have to "learn to live on more reduced means" and that controllable expenses would be flat.
Walter E. Mattson, president of The New York Times Company, said 1990 had been "the most difficult year" for the company since the mid-1970's, when the city went through a fiscal crisis during a national recession.
 
Lower Earnings Predicted
 Mr. Mattson said that the company's earnings per share for 1990 would be 80 to 90 cents, compared with 87 cents in 1989.
In both years, there were significant special charges, such as start-up costs associated with a new printing plant in Edison, N.J. Mr. Mattson said that on an operating basis, earnings for 1990 would be off by 8.5 percent to 14.5 percent.
Mr. Mattson predicted "somewhat lower earnings over all" for 1991, mostly because of an 8 percent lineage loss expected for The New York Times, which he said would be offset somewhat by higher ad rates and aggressive circulation pricing.
William O. Taylor, chief executive officer of Affiliated Publications, which owns The Boston Globe, said that The Globe had been hard hit by the particularly severe economic slump in New England.
Operating income for the company in 1990 would be off by about 26 percent, Mr. Taylor said, and The Globe's advertising volume for 1991 was expected to decline further, although rate increases were expected to keep revenues flat.

HEADLINE: 4 Towns on L.I. Say They'll Sue To Keep Dumps

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, L.I., Dec. 13

 BODY:
Four towns on Long Island's East End said today that they would sue the State Department of Environmental Conservation to block a law requiring them to close their landfills.
The law, enacted in 1983 because of concern about the effect of landfills on the Island's underground water supply, gave the towns seven years to close their landfills. The deadline is Tuesday. But the four towns said they do not know what they would do with their trash. 
 "We can't afford to pay another $3 million a year to truck our garbage somewhere else," said Tony Bullock, Supervisor of East Hampton. He said he would like to keep his landfill open for several more years, as the town of 18,000 people eventually recycles or composts 81 percent of its trash.
"Shutting the landfills now would bring enormous environmental and economic consequences which would be far more injurious to the people of Long Island than keeping the dumps open for another year or two," Mr. Bullock said. If the landfills were closed now, he said, it would cost the four towns about $10 million in 1991 to truck their garbage elsewhere.
The suit, which is to be filed in State Supreme Court on Friday by East Hampton, Southold and Riverhead, seeks to have the law thrown out on the grounds that it is unconstitutional and inappropriate. Shelter Island said it plans to join the suit, which also seeks a temporary injunction to prevent the state from enforcing the law until the case can be heard.
The East End towns, on the farthest end of the Island from New York City, have been squabbling with state environmental officials for months over garbage-disposal plans.
This fall, Thomas C. Jorling, the agency Commissioner, proposed a complex series of garbage swaps in which one town would send its trash to another town's landfill, for instance, in return for taking that town's leaves for composting. The towns balked, and Mr. Bullock said today that state officials had presented nothing but "farcical proposals that ignored the geographic and logistical realities."
But the Commissioner said that the East End towns had petulantly and arrogantly blocked every state effort to come up with workable plan.
The Commissioner said the state would force the recalcitrant towns to comply by taking them to court.

HEADLINE: U.S. Vehicle Sales Up; Rebates Are a Factor

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Sales of American-made vehicles picked up in early December, prodded by record rebates and deliveries to rental fleets. But wary buyers kept retail demand soft.
Over all, domestic vehicle sales increased 22 percent in the first 10 days of December, a deceptively large rise because sales for the period last year were very weak. 
 The 10 domestic manufacturers sold 136,754 cars, an increase of 27.5 percent. Seasonally adjusted, cars sold at an annual rate of 6.5 million, compared with an annual rate of 5.6 million in the period last year. For the last 60 days, cars sold at an annual rate of 6.6 million. So far this year, cars have been selling at an annual rate of 6.9 million.
Sales of light trucks, which account for about a third of overall vehicle sales, rose 14 percent, to 83,766 pickups, mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles.
Scott Merlis, an automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley, said demand for cars and light trucks remained "very depressed." Mr. Merlis attributed the sales gains to rebates averaging $1,050 a vehicle, which he said was a record for the last three months of the year.
"That means volume without profit, no matter how you slice it," he said.
"The real problem is that a lot of polls are saying a majority of American consumers think war is likely," Mr. Merlis added. "So I can understand why showroom traffic may be slow."
Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers' Association, cautioned against "reading too much into these numbers."
"Sales tend to be volatile this time of year due to the relatively low level of sales," Mr. Webb said, adding that the latest reports of sales volume and showroom traffic from dealers were "rather pessimistic."
"That leads me to believe that fleets are propping up the sales figures again," he said. "True demand remains weak."
Japanese auto makers with factories in the United States posted a slight decline in their share of the domestic market for cars. The share fell to 9 percent in early December from 10 percent a year earlier.
The General Motors Corporation sold 65,527 cars in early December, a gain of 27.9 percent over last year's poor sales. G.M.'s small, high-mileage Geo Metro commuter car continued to sell well, partly on the strength of a large fleet order. Several G.M. models popular with fleet buyers also posted large sales gains, including Chevrolet's Lumina and full-sized Caprice, and the Pontiac Sunbird.
G.M. sold 33,872 light trucks, a gain of 11.6 percent.
 
 Ford Car Sales Up 32.3%
 The Ford Motor Company sold 41,264 cars in early December, a gain of 32.3 percent. Analysts said Ford benfited from a large delivery of its Lincoln Town Car model to daily rental companies during the period. Ford's light truck sales rose 32.6 percent, to 33,850 units.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales rose 25.4 percent, to 17,932 cars in early December. But sales of Chrysler's light trucks, including mini-vans and Jeeps, fell 13.2 percent, to 14,314 vehicles.
The Honda Motor Company sold 3,821 domestically produced cars in early December, a decline of 31.6 percent. A Honda spokesman said the company's car sales fell while others rose because Honda did not sell its cars to fleets.
The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 4,628 cars made in the United States, a gain of 47.4 percent. Toyota also reported that it sold 9,045 imported cars and 2,414 imported light trucks during the first 10 days of December.
The reporting of import sales by Toyota was the first time a major importer has followed the United States industry practice of providing sales information on a 10-day basis.
Until now foreign auto makers have reported their sales of imports to the United States only at the end of each month. However, those companies with plants in the United States already provide domestic sales results every 10 days.
Toyota's decision to follow the domestic industry practice comes in the wake of Chrysler's announcement last week that it would stop reporting its domestic sales every 10 days.
A Chrysler spokesman said the company was evaluating the move by Toyota, but declined to comment on whether it might alter its decision to stop reporting sales every 10 days.
An official for Honda said the company had no intention of reporting its import sales every 10 days.

HEADLINE: Despite Auto Fuel Economy, Environment Could Worsen

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Improvements in automobile gasoline mileage that would help the global environment would be more than wiped out by the rising number of automobiles on the road, said a study made public yesterday.
The study by the World Resources Institute, a leading private organization concerned with the environment, said the number of motor vehicles is rising by 4.6 percent a year, about two and a half times as fast as the human population. By the year 2010, the number could reach 1.1 billion, more than double the current level, as the number of vehicles is rising by about two for each one thousand people every year, the study said. 
 In addition, the study said, "There is troubling evidence that worldwide, new cars are becoming less efficient" in their use of fuel.
 
A Plateau in Fuel Efficiency
 A pollution analyst at the Ford Motor Company, Michael J. Scharz, said the estimate on the number of cars was "not out of the realm of possibility." But he said most of the rise would have to be in the undeveloped world, where economic progress might not sustain such progress.
An effort to lift fuel economy standards died in Congress at the end of the last session, but backers plan to try again. Cars sold in this country this year are about 4 percent less fuel efficient, on average, than those sold in 1988. The average fuel efficiency of cars on the road is still rising slowly, because the 1990-model cars are more efficient than old cars being scrapped, but a plateau in auto fuel economy is in sight in this country, the report said.
The solution, it said, includes cars with very high gas mileage, as well as electric cars that do not burn fossil fuels, mass transit and reduction of other gas emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect, including chlorofluorocarbons, from car air conditioners.
Vehicles produce a growing fraction of the carbon dioxide that scientists fear will produce substantial climate changes in the next century. According to the study, "Driving Forces: Motor Vehicle Trends and their Implications for Global Warming, Energy Strategies, and Transportation Planning," vehicles accounted for 12 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion in 1971; in 1985, it was 14 percent.
Last month 18 European nations agreed to keep their carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels to reduce climate change, and they invited all other industrialized nations to do the same. But most of the growth is likely to come outside Europe and North America; Africa and Asia, excluding Japan, which make up nearly three quarters of the world's population, have only 12 percent of its motor vehicles, according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States,
But Mr. Schwarz, of Ford, said that the report "doesn't address the social and economic implications of concluding that you have to stop, or drastically reduce, carbon dioxide from transportation sources."
Stabilizing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would require far more than just holding fossil fuel use constant, the experts say. It would require cutting emissions by 50 percent or more.

HEADLINE: Half a Decision on Health Care for the Poor

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The State Senate today passed a bill to extend a fund that covers poor and uninsured hospital patients in New Jersey, as concern rose that inaction in the Assembly might force the state's hospital system into financial crisis on Jan. 1.
At issue is a debt-ridden trust fund that reimburses hospitals when they care for some of the million people in New Jersey who lack insurance. With the fund scheduled to expire at the end of the month, Gov. Jim Florio and the Democrat-controlled Legislature must choose between three unattractive alternatives: continuing a system whose cost is slowly winding out of control, enacting a new tax or permitting many hospitals to fall into crisis. 
 The Senate voted 34 to 2 to extend the fund, the Uncompensated Care Trust Fund, for 90 days. But Democrats in the Assembly said there was strong sentiment among their members to let the trust fund lapse to confront the public with the consequences of not raising taxes.
 
'An Ever Worsening Cycle'
 "My feeling is that when you deal with a problem, you need to come up with a real solution," said Joseph V. Doria Jr., the Speaker of the Assembly. "Putting things off for 90 days is not a real solution. You are just feeding into an ever worsening cycle."
 The Assembly's last scheduled session to act on the issue is Monday.
Under the current system, when patients cannot pay for hospital care, the cost is covered by the state's Uncompensated CareTrust Fund. The fund is supported by a surcharge on the hospital bills of those who can pay, a charge that has recently grown to 19 percent. The surcharge is driving up health-insurance costs and is actually pushing people and employers who pay for health insurance to drop their coverage.
As more people go uninsured, the surcharge continues to rise. Health experts agree that unless something is done to change the system, it is bound to spiral out of control. The trust fund, which is now more than $1 billion dollars in debt, would levy a 23 percent tax if extended to next year.
In October, a commission appointed by Governor Florio offered far-reaching proposals to control medical costs and replace the fund with a $450 million tax on employers. The tax would shift the cost of care for the uninsured and indigent from the pool of people using hospitals to a $144 tax on companies for each of their employees.
But with New Jersey's anti-tax fervor, legislators and the Governor's office agreed that anything resembling a new tax was unfeasible. Democratic leaders in the two houses now appear divided over whether a three-month extension is the best alternative.
"Is the right choice throwing the system into chaos?" said Senator Richard J. Codey, a Democrat of West Orange, the sponsor of the bill passed by the Senate today. "A new tax is just not going to happen. Forget it. The Senate has done the right thing and the smart thing. Now it is up to the Assembly."
Under the law, if the trust fund lapses, hospitals would still be required to care for the indigent. But they would then have to charge other patients to cover the cost.
 
Possible Crisis in Urban Hospitals
 A result would be a sudden jump in charges at some urban hospitals that provide care to large numbers of patients who cannot pay, said Charles A. Mowll, vice president of the New Jersey Hospital Association. University Hospital in Newark, for example, would be forced to add a surtax of as much as 50 percent, Mr. Mowll said.
Over time, some hospitals would become far more expensive than others and paying patients would flee to less expensive institutions. Some urban hospitals might eventually treat nearly all indigent patients, Mr. Mowll said, without having paying patients to cover the costs.
Some urban hospitals might have to cut back on services, other health experts said. Poor patients with drug problems, AIDS and other severe problems would be sent to smaller suburban hospitals that were not prepared to cope with them.
It is unclear, government health officials said, how quickly or severely such problems would arise. But all agreed that if the fund was not extended, the public within weeks would see a problem that until now appeared abstract and removed from all but health-care specialists.
 
Forcing the Issue
 Governor Florio has refused to take a position on the issue, leaving it instead to the Legislature to adopt the recommendations of his commission or find an alternative. But some Democratic Assembly members have argued behind closed doors that forcing a hospital crisis would bring public pressure for a solution, possibly even support for a new tax.
The Republican minority leader, Garabed L. Haytaian, however, dismissed such a move as cynical and warned that the public would hold the Democrats responsible for a hospital crisis.
"If they want to fabricate a problem by not dealing with it by the end of the year, it is going to be very interesting," Mr. Haytaian said. There is not enough confidence in government as it is. Remember, the Democrats are in charge."
When asked for his position, however, Mr. Haytaian said he would endorse neither a new tax nor an extension of the trust fund until he had conferred with other Republican Assembly members.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DECISION;
U.S. FARMERS COOL TO SOVIET AID DEAL

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 13

 BODY:
President Bush's decision to temporarily lift a ban on lending to the Soviet Union and provide $1 billion in agricultural loans received a less-than-enthusiastic response in the farm community today.
Representatives of farm groups said the President's action, which was intended to help the Soviet Union meet anticipated winter food shortages, was encouraging to the farmers who will benefit from the purchases but over all it was too late, was far less than farmers had hoped and would have no significant impact on farm income. 
 "It's been a long time coming, and it's good that it's finally here," said Terry Francl, an economist at the American Farm Bureau, the largest farm organization with 3.9 million members. "The other side of the issue is that there have been a lot of countries that have already extended credit to the Soviets, and there is no question that we have lost sales to these competitors."
 
Not 'Euphoric'
 Barry Jenkins, a spokesman for the National Wheat Growers Association, said, "This is something we have worked with the Congress and the President on for some time, but it would be way too strong to say we are euphoric."
The farmers' biggest concern was the amount of money involved. The $1 billion is less than 1 percent of the United States farm economy's annual revenues of $150 billion.
The amount is significantly less than many farmers and traders in the commodities markets had expected. There had been rumors that new loans or loan guarantees to the Soviets would total $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
The commodities markets, which had closed by the time of the announcement on Wednesday, reflected the letdown yesterday. At the Chicago Board of Trade, prices on all three of the major grain futures contracts -- corn, wheat, and soybeans -- closed lower. The contract to deliver soybeans in January closed at $5.88 a bushel, down 8.75 cents. The March 1991 corn contact finished at $2.35 a bushel, down 4 cents. The March 1991 wheat contract settled at $2.65, off 2 cents.
 
No Additional Sales
 If the reaction was, on balance, negative, one reason is that the $1 billion will allow the Soviets to fulfill purchase commitments they had already agreed to under grain accords reached in the 1980's. Thus, it will produce no incremental sales for American farmers.
On the other hand, a worldwide glut of wheat is depressing prices for farmers in this country. Other governments have tried to help their own farmers by subsidizing purchases, and the loan guarantees will make United States farmers more competitive.
But important questions remain unanswered. For instance, it was unclear today how long it would take to disburse the full $1 billion.
Another unresolved issue is the level of interest rates that the Soviets will pay. Lower rates would give them more money to buy commodities.
Finally, it is unclear exactly what foods will be bought by the Soviets. It could include corn, wheat and soybeans, as well as frozen meats like chicken parts.

HEADLINE: NCR Board Said to Reject A.T.& T.'s $90-a-Share Offer

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The board of the NCR Corporation rejected the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's $90-a-share cash bid for the company in a board meeting yesterday, people involved in the situation said.
The decision by the directors, which is expected to be announced today, sets the stage for a possible proxy battle with A.T.& T. over control of NCR's board of directors. Control of the board is necessary to remove NCR's "poison pill," which would make the bid prohibitively expensive. 
 People involved in the situation said that the rejection appeared to amount to little more than a so-called "just say no" defense, in which the target company simply refuses to accept the offered price from a bidder instead of seeking another merger partner or initiating a recapitalization that would result in a higher price for its shareholders.
A spokeswoman for NCR declined to comment. A spokesman for A.T.& T. said the company had not heard any news about the board meeting.
NCR has said it has been approached by third parties interested in the company, but it has stressed that it wants to remain independent. NCR's chairman, Charles E. Exley Jr., has also said that he intends to avoid a recapitalization that would saddle the company with debt.
 
Proxy Fight Indicated
 Mr. Exley, who was not available for an interview yesterday, has also said he will resign if A.T.&T. prevails.
A highly regarded computer executive, Mr. Exley directed NCR's dramatic retooling of the product line, and has said that the company faces a promising future on its own.
A.T.& T. has indicated that it will begin a proxy fight against NCR's 12-member board of directors if its takeover offer continues to be spurned by NCR. "It is still an option for us," Walter Murphy, an A.T.& T. spokesman, said yesterday. "We will decide at the appropriate time whether to exercise that option or not."
NCR is also preparing for a proxy fight and is working with the proxy solicitor Georgeson & Company. Mr. Exley is planning to meet with large institutional shareholders, who control more than 60 percent of NCR stock, to try to persuade them not to tender their shares to A.T.& T.
News of the board's rejection of the A.T.& T. offer came after the market was closed. A.T.& T. stock rose 62.5 cents yesterday, to $31; NCR also gained 62.5 cents to close at $90.125.
 
Management an Issue
 Wall Street professionals are increasingly puzzled by NCR's lack of a solid defense and Mr. Exley's repeated statements that the company just wants to be left alone. But the move may well be a tactical effort to force A.T.& T., which has said it is determined to acquire NCR, to increase its bidding price.
Such a tactic could force the two companies into a negotiated merger. NCR has said that it will consider a deal if A.T.& T. pays $125 a share. The telecommunications company has refused to offer that amount. Analysts said that the deal made economic sense for A.T.& T. up to about $110 a share.

HEADLINE: Losses Widen at S.& L.'s

BYLINE: AP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Despite the Government's crash program to close failed savings and loans, losses at the surviving solvent institutions more than doubled in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarter, regulators said today.
Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said the decline was a result of the slumping real estate market. 
 Savings institutions lost $631 million in the third quarter, compared with a revised $302 million in the second quarter and $373 million in the first quarter. The second-quarter loss had originally been reported as $196 million.
 
Real Estate Is Crucial
 Mr. Ryan said housing construction was at an eight-year low and commercial vacancy rates were rising. "As long as the real estate slump continues, the thrift industry will have a tough time improving performance," he said.
The losses occurred at marginal institutions and at those that regulators say are virtually certain to fail. The institutions that are expected to fail are concentrated in five states: California has 23; Florida, 23; Texas, 19; New Jersey, 17, and Illinois, 15.
The deterioration among solvent institutions occurred even though the Government has been closing the worst institutions. At the end of September, there were 2,389 privately run savings and loans, 208 fewer than at the startof the year.
"The guys that were healthy are not as healthy, but that's not surprising since the economy isn't as healthy and the housing market is in the dumper," said Martin Regalia, an economist with the National Council of Savings Institutions.
He predicted that the losses to be reported for the current quarter and the first quarter of 1991 would also be "fairly disheartening," and he called on the Government to close insolvent institutions as soon as possible.
"It's quite clear that keeping defunct institutions in the market worsens the environment for solvent institutions," he said.
Earlier this week Mr. Ryan told a House Banking Committee task force that starting next month his office would increase the pace of closings to seven or eight a week, from two or three a week now.
His agency divides the industry into four groups: 1,130 profitable and well-capitalized institutions, which as a group earned $508 million in the quarter; 685 that meet or are expected to meet minimum standards, which earned $138 million; 356 marginal institutions with poor earnings, which lost $230 million, and 218 that are considered all but certain to fail, which lost $1.05 billion.
Results were not disclosed for 206 institutions that were open but under the control of the Resolution Trust Corporation at the end of September.

HEADLINE: RULES MAY TIGHTEN ON CABLE TV RATES

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission proposed new rules today that would give communities more power to limit the prices for local cable television service.
Under the existing F.C.C. rules, only about 3 percent of the nation's more than 9,500 cable television systems have their rates regulated. 
 Cable television rates have doubled and tripled in many cities since Congress deregulated the industry in 1984. The F.C.C. proposal, which could be enacted as early as the spring, reflects a widespread conviction among Federal officials that cable companies in many cities enjoy virtual monopolies and have raised their rates too freely.
 
Tighter Definition of Competition
 The commission's proposal follows a recent deadlock in Congress on legislation that would have restrained cable companies' ability to set prices.
The new F.C.C. rule would tighten the legal definition of "effective competition" for local cable systems. That definition largely determines whether a municipality has the right to regulate local cable rates.
Under the F.C.C.'s present definition, local cable rates are not regulated as long as there are at least three over-the-air, or broadcast, television stations in the area. In effect, that has meant that very few cable systems could face any kind of regulation.
Under the proposed rule, the commission would define "effective competition" in three new ways.
Competition would exist in an area if television viewers there can receive at least six broadcast stations and if less than half the households subscribe to the cable system.
Effective competition would also exist if new technologies that rival cable, like satellite television or microwave broadcasting, are available to at least half the households in an area and are used by at least 10 percent of the households.
As a practical matter, F.C.C. officials said, most of the nation's cable systems would not be considered to face competition under either of these criteria. Yet cable companies in largest metropolitan areas, where there is a greater number of television stations and cable systems, would generally be more likely to meet one of the requirements for effective competition and thus would not have their rates regulated.
F.C.C. officials said cable systems in Los Angeles, Chicago and the Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., area might meet the first standard for effective competition. And William F. Squadron, the Commissioner of Telecommunications and Energy in New York City, said some cable systems in the city might come under this standard as well.
 
'Good Actor' Standard
 But a cable company could escape local price control, even if it fails to meet the effective competition standard, by providing evidence that it is a "good actor." Although details of this definition have not yet been determined, a "good actor" would be a cable company that provides basic services at prices that are comparable to those offered in cities where there is effective competition.
Some consumer groups and local officials criticized the "good actor" provision as a loophole in the proposed F.C.C. rule. But it was not enough to satisfy representatives of the cable industry, who attacked the commission's proposal.
"This proposal raises the prospect of the Government inhibiting the future development of cable programming by crimping its economic lifeblood," James P. Mooney, president of the National Cable Television Association, said in a statement.
Mr. Mooney warned that Government regulators would be likely to emphasize simple price controls.
 
Warning of a Loophole
 Local officials praised the F.C.C. for deciding to jettison its old standard, but said the "good actor" provision could effectively gut the rest of the proposal. "The 'good actor' clause could be a loophole that eats up the entire rule," said Nicholas Miller, a Washington lawyer who represents St. Louis, Laredo, Tex., and other cities on cable issues.
"It's unfortunate that the F.C.C. has not adopted what is really the most sensible standard, which is either that there is another cable operator in the market or another multichannel system provider," Mr. Squadron, the New York City official, said.
David C. Olson, director of Portland, Ore.'s office of cable communications, said he was cautiously optimistic about the F.C.C. proposal. "We appreciate the commission's recognition that the current standard is meaningless," he said. "Having said that, we've got to see the specific language of this proposal."
F.C.C. officials said the proposal offered a way to exert control over cable companies without becoming embroiled in trying to determine what constitutes reasonable pricing. The hope is that cable companies will behave as if they faced competition, simply to escape the prospect of having local officials decide everything from their rates of return to their cost structures.
But F.C.C. officials acknowledged today that they did not know how many cable systems would be able to meet the "good actor" standard.
Congress came close to passing legislation that would have imposed modest new regulations and encouraged competition. But the measure collapsed at the last minute because of opposition from the Bush Administration.
In today's action, the F.C.C.'s chairman, Alfred C. Sikes, made it clear that he wanted to create what amounts to a substitute for head-to-head competition.
"We are attempting to develop rules that deal as sensitively as possible with the marketplace and give the public some assurance of fairness," he said.
Many details must still be resolved, however. The most difficult will be deciding on the benchmark prices for a "competitive tier" of basic cable service, because cable systems package their services in many different ways. Under the Federal cable law passed in 1984, "basic service" is any cable service that includes the re-transmission of broadcast television stations.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DECISION;
U.S. AND PARTNERS IN ACCORD ON AID TO SOVIET ECONOMY

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The international community today swung behind President Bush's plan to help revamp the Soviet economy, but the United States continued to insist that Moscow make profound changes before it gets any money from international lending institutions.
The plan calls for a Special Association status for the Soviet Union in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, but stops short of giving Moscow the full membership it needs to draw on the institutions' financial resources. 
 The two Washington-based organizations would become deeply involved in the transformation of the world's second largest economy from a command to a market based one. A senior American trade offical said the situation "could evolve toward full membership."
 
Compromise by Brady
 The proposal, drawn up by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and discussed with his counterparts from the leading industrialized nations before the President announced it on Wednesday, is a compromise resulting from talks at the economic summit meeting in Houston in July.
President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany had pressed for immediate membership, and flows of money from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to Moscow. President Bush had argued that the money might be wasted if it were disbursed before the Soviets reforms were much further along.
President Bush was also sensitive to criticism from conservative Republicans who are doubtful about the prospects for change in the Soviet Union and have been hostile to the idea of international assistance to Moscow.
 
Broad Range of Advice
 Under the compromise, the two institutions would coordinate outside technical and financial assistance and provide broad advice on matters like financial and exchange-rate policies and ways to make fundamental changes in the transportation and energy sectors.
The agencies would also establish a permanent presence in Moscow, with the fund conducting annual reviews of the Soviet economy as it does now for its 154 member countries.
The senior American Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity called the plan "a calibrated way forward" to integrating the Soviet economy with the world economy.
The official added: "It reflects the unique circumstances we find today, a Soviet Union that clearly is struggling to move down the path of political and economic reform, a country that has a vast economic potential, but at this time has vast economic problems, and a country that is interested in re-engaging in the broader world economy. We want to help them find a pragmatic way forward in that re-engagement."
 
Support by Foreign Officials
 Despite the differing views that were expressed in Houston, most foreign officials said they could support this new approach.
"Every move to bring the Soviet Union closer to these international banking organizations, accelerating the process of integrating the Soviets into the world's free-market economy, is very welcome," said Hans-Henning Horstmann, spokesman at the German Embassy.
Lionel Majeste-Larrouy, press counselor at the French Embassy, said that while his Government had not formally responded, "We are very much in favor of that and will express our satisfaction."
A Japanese Embassy press counselor, Hideaki Ueda, said his Government supported the initiative, but noted that it was uncertain to what extent the Soviet authorities would provide bank and fund technical teams with the information they need.
 
Other Points of Friction
 There could be other points of friction as the two institutions play a greater management role in Moscow. In the past many member governments have objected to recommendations for economic austerity, especially from the fund, arguing that such advice ignores political realities.
The fund, for example, traditionally recommends cuts in consumer and other subsidies. In some countries, for example, in Egypt in the late 1970's and in the Dominican Republic in the mid-1980's, those cuts have led to angry street marches and other demonstrations.
But Soviet officials regard the move positively. Anatoly F. Dobrynin, a consultant to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet Ambassador to Washington in much of the postwar era, told a luncheon here that his Government was "in favor of the closest possible cooperation" with the two organizations. But he added: "How it will be done is not quite clear."
 
'Half Mystery, Half Reality'
 He noted that to most of his countrymen, the bank and the fund "are still rather half mystery, half reality."
The International Monetary Fund helps countries deal with short-term imbalances in their foreign accounts. The World Bank makes longer-term loans to strengthen sectors of an economy by building dams, fertilizer plants, irrigation works, ports, highways and other such projects.
American and international officials said that they expected the plan to be considered early in the new year by the boards of the two organizations and that it might be in operation by the time the two organizations hold their April meetings in Washington.
The proposal was made just a week before the bank and the fund, along with the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Develoment, are to submit a report to leaders of industrialized countries on ways the institutions can help the Soviet Union.
 
To Assess Soviet Economy
 The officials at the Houston meeting requested the report in the hope of ending the conflict over Soviet membership in the bank and the fund. The initiative by President Bush and Mr. Brady will now somewhat upstages that report, which is being prepared chiefly by the fund.
The report is expected to provide a comprehensive and timely assessment of the Soviet economy, and according to the American Treasury official, "we think it will provide a firm base for the Soviets to consider their own reform efforts and for us to consider the best ways to support those reform efforts."
American officials say they believe the international aid should help President Gorbachev politically and send signals to the private sectors to become more engaged in the Soviet economy.
 
Repatriation of Capital
 A bilateral trade agreement that has already been concluded and investment and tax agreements that are now being negotiated are expected to reassure the private sector, convincing it to "re-engage," the American Treasury official said.
The agreements would provide assurances to the business community on matters like repatriation of capital and rules on expropriatiion.
In an interview with Fortune Magazine published today, Mr. Gorbachev urged American businesses to make big investments in his country.
"I think the potential is tremendous for both of us," he said. "Our economies are so enormous that they need each other. They need to cooperate."

HEADLINE: In Korea Talks, Still a Gulf of Distrust

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Three months ago, North and South Korea began a series of high-level talks, cautious but hopeful about airing their differences politely and reducing tensions that have kept them in a state of hostility since the Korean War ended in 1953.
 But as the third round of discussions adjourn today, the gulf of suspicion between Seoul and Pyongyang seemed as wide as ever, perhaps even wider, with each nation accusing the other of using the talks for subversion instead of understanding. 
 The Prime Ministers of North and South Korea did agree to try again at another meeting in Pyongyang in late February. But spokesmen for both seem to be saying the talks would continue primarily because there have been such high hopes and neither side wants to be blamed for ending them.
The North Korean spokesman, Ahn Byung Soo, said, "We don't even know in which direction this discussion is heading," adding that the latest session was "a step backward." Yet when asked if it was time to give up, he replied, "We must never do anything to break up these talks."
The South Korean spokesman, Lim Dong Won, countered by lamenting the two sides' failure to overcome their "deep barrier of mistrust," and he accused the Communists of "slander and vilification against the South."
 
Next Talks in February
 The North Korean delegation is to return to Pyongyang on Friday. As they prepared to leave, the common theme of both sides was that the talks proved that they were still deeply suspicious of each other's intentions, frozen in the thinking of the cold war and using the negotiating table as a forum to score old propaganda points.
Doubts were also raised about the next round of talks, scheduled for Feb. 25 to 28, because that is around the time for the annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea.
The exercises this year are certain to be curtailed because of the Persian Gulf situation and American budgetary constraints. But many experts think that North Korea could use the exercises as an excuse to cancel or postpone the talks while blaming the South.
Ostensibly the main focus of the stalemate was the two sides' failure to agree to a "declaration of nonagression." They narrowed their differences on the form of a possible document but not the substance and broke up accusing each other of insincerity.
The difference stemmed from North Korea's insistence on an immediate signing of such a declaration while South Korea seeks first to undertake "confidence-building measures" like economic exchanges, cultural and family visits and small-scale sharing of military information.
 
Aggressive Behavior Cited
 The difference between the two approaches may seem minor but actually they underscore the nature of the two sides' lingering fears about each other's intentions.
South Korean officials say, for instance, that North Korea had never changed its attitude or behavior in the last decade, when it carried out bombings and assassinations against the South and maintained large tunnels under the demilitarized zone for a potential invasion.
These officials add that if Seoul agrees to a seemingly innocuous declaration of nonagression, North Korea will use it as a propaganda tool to undermine the Seoul Government's legitimacy and demand expulsion of American troops from Korea.
Such a campaign, they fear, might be effective among left-leaning South Korean dissidents with whom Pyongyang has long made common cause.
South Korean diplomats thus now say they think North Korea will stay with the talks because it wants to score points during the coming political season in what Pyongyang has long called its "united front" with radicals seeking to overthrow the Seoul Government.
North Korea made its own phobias more clear this week as well, with officials from Pyongyang declaring that they viewed South Korea's desire for cultural and economic exchanges and family reunions not as harmless gestures, but as a ploy to undermine their own Communist system.
While outsiders may view the example of East and West Germany uniting as an inspiration, North Korea appears to have taken umbrage, warning that it will not be "eaten up" by its economically formidable capitalist neighbor.
A tone of near xenophobia crept into North Korea's statements, as officials denounced President Roh Tae Woo for currying favor with China, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe -- one-time allies of Pyongyang -- in a bid to undermine what it proudly regards as a credo of self-reliance.
It was, in any case, obvious that a special role was being played in these talks by four nations that are major regional powers -- the United States, the Soviet Union, China and Japan.
These countries make it clear that they are increasingly impatient with the insistence by North and South Korea on maintaining northeast Asia as the world's last relic of cold war confrontation. Each is prodding the two countries to be reasonable in the talks.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Poll Finds Americans Divided On Sanctions or Force in Gulf

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Americans are almost evenly divided over whether the United States should take military action or give sanctions more time if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations Security Council, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
Americans are skeptical of anything described simply as a compromise with President Saddam Hussein, according to the Times/CBS News survey, but there are indications from other surveys that Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, followed by concessions to Iraq on Kuwaiti oil or territory, would be favorably greeted by Americans. 
 A total of 1,044 adults were questioned for the poll by telephone from Sunday through Tuesday, just as Iraq released the Americans and others who had been held hostage since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The poll, and several other recent surveys of American public opinion on the gulf confrontation, suggest that the decision of perhaps one of five Americans on whether to support a war would be heavily influenced by the specific circumstances at the moment of conflict.
Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Report, said the wording of survey questions could produce a swing of as much as 20 percentage points in support for war, from the low 40's to the mid-60's.
A bare majority in other polls say they would support war when they are offered no alternative policy, but support for war decreases when the option of maintaining economic sanctions is included.
Support for war increases when the role of the United Nations is emphasized, Mr. Newport said.
"Bush will face a divided public if in fact we go to war," said Mr. Newport, "There is by no means a consensus. It depends on the circumstances and to some degree of the spin put on the situation."
About 40 percent of the country seems ready to support war under most circumstances, and about a third are against it under most circumstances, several recent polls show.
 
Feelings of Crucial Group
 Peter Hart, a Democratic poll taker, said there was a crucial group in the middle. About one in five Americans, he said, express support for military action but prefer that the Bush Adminstration find a peaceful alternative that could include concessions on oil and territory after an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
"It's not the rush to war," said Mr. Hart. "We can do other things." The group willing to support war but preferring negotiation tends to be younger, and made up more of Republicans and political independents, Mr. Hart said.
Blacks, Democrats and women, particularly young women, are the most opposed to war under any circumstances.
Based on statistical sampling theory, the Times/CBS News survey's findings should generally be within three percentage points, plus or minus, of what the poll takers would have found if they had tried to survey all Americans.
 
Strong Antipathy to Hussein
 An emerging poltical problem for President Bush in the gulf confrontation may well be his overwhelming success in convincing Americans that Saddam Hussein himself is at the core of the problem.
While the country is divided over whether to go to war, 8 out of 10 Americans agree with the suggestion that the crisis in the Persian Gulf will continue until President Hussein, whom President Bush has compared to Hitler, is removed from power -- an end not likely to be achieved short of war.
This finding harkens back to Walter Lippmann's observation in 1955 that American public opinion on war and peace is often out of sync with what he called "objective developments."
Americans are slow to rouse against a foreign threat, he said, and "to overcome this inertia the enemy had to be portrayed as evil incarnate."
But then opinion swings too far, he continued, looking back toward the world wars, and "as a result of this impasssioned nonsense, public opinion became so envenomed that the people would not countenance a workable peace."
American reaction to potential developments in the Persian Gulf seems heavily influenced by how those developments are portrayed.
 
Varied Questions on Issue
 The Times/CBS News Poll asked whether the United States should negotiate a compromise with Saddam Hussein or "stick to its original demand that Iraq leave Kuwait entirely." Asked this way, 6 out of 10 said the United States should stick to its original demand.
But the Gallup Organization, in a poll last week for Newsweek, put the question differently.
"Suppose Iraq withdraws from Kuwait, the former government is restored and later the Arab countries work out an agreement to meet some of Iraq's demands for territory," the question asked. Nearly 7 out of 10 said that would be a success for United States policy.
 
Poll With Similar Pattern
 A similiar pattern emerged on the question of whether the United States should go to war to drive Iraq out of Kuwait after the Jan. 15 deadline.
A poll for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, conducted virtually at the same time as the latest Times/CBS News Poll, found 54 percent in favor when asked simply if the United States should go to war against Iraq if Iraq did not withdraw its troops from Kuwait by the deadline. Thirty-four percent were opposed to war.
But the Times/CBS News Poll asked the question differently, adding the option of waiting longer to see if the trade embargo and other economic sanctions worked. Offered that choice, 45 percent said the United States should start military actions and 48 percent said it should wait to see if sanctions worked.
 
Larger Swing Reported
 The Gallup Organization, in its poll for Newsweek, recorded an even larger swing. About 56 percent said United States forces should engage in combat if Iraq refused to leave Kuwait and restore its former government.
But two questions later on the same poll they were asked if President Bush should begin military action soon after the Jan. 15 deadline or wait longer to see if economic and diplomatic sanctions were effective.
Forty-one percent said begin military actions and 53 percent said wait longer, a swing of about one in six Americans away from military action when nonviolent pressure was offered as an option.
With the budget debacle and the midterm election behind him, President Bush's overall standing improved. Some 61 percent said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job, up from 55 percent in November and 52 percent in October.
Mr. Bush's standing improved in several more specific areas as well.
Approval of his handling of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait increased to 57 percent, from 50 percent in November. Half of the public said they thought Mr. Bush had explained the situation in the Middle East well enough, up from 41 percent who said so in November.
There was somewhat greater optimism that war could be avoidided.
Forty-four percent said they believed the situation would be resolved without fighting, up from 36 percent in November, just after the President dispatched thousands of additional troops to the gulf.
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 9 to 11 with 1,044 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education. In theory, in 19 of 20 cases the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The percentages reported are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adult Americans. Other possible percentages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for blacks it is plus or minus nine percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Move Against Minority Aid Is Debated

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
A sense of disbelief and in some cases defiance gripped colleges and major education associations throughout the nation yesterday, after it was learned earlier this week that the Department of Education was considering scholarships granted only to minority student to be illegal.
In Washington, where many of the larger education organizations are, the morning was busy as meetings were called and agendas hastily amended to discuss what many are calling an assault on efforts to include more minority students in higher education. But in other quarters the Education Department's reversal on minority scholarships was applauded. 
 "It's a tough issue that needs to be discussed openly and frankly," said Steven M. Cahn, provost and professor of philosophy at The Graduate School of The City University of New York. "If anyone has a quick answer, they are oversimplifying it."
The policy change, disclosed by an Assistant Secretary at the Education Department, came as a surprise to top White House officials, who took it under review. Presidential aides said today that a White House staff meeting was marked by strong debate on whether to accept the regulation.
Six influential education organizations representing 3,000 public and private colleges and universities met yesterday and struggled to measure the implications that banning scholarships for minority students might have on their institutions.
 
'Great Deal of Confusion'
 "Right now there is a great deal of confusion," said Allan Ostar, president of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, who attended that meeting. "We need a legal clarification, and we've got to provide some guidance to our institutions."
Like scores of education experts contacted yesterday, Mr. Ostar said he did not know how many minority scholarships or students could potentially be affected by the decision. A spokesman for a respected Eastern university who asked not to be identified said hundreds of programs at his college alone might have to be reviewed.
Mr. Ostar said his group, which meets twice a month, was discussing writing a letter of concern to President Bush on the matter. He said it was also considering asking Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to intervene.
In the meantime, a former Assistant Secretary of Education, David Tatel, was preparing a white paper on behalf of the organizations, analyzing the Education Department's new position on minority college aid, Mr. Ostar said.
"We are telling our members to keep their powder dry and don't panic," he said.
 
Many Colleges Use Need Only
 At many institutions, including most of the Ivy League universities, scholarship assistance to undergraduates is based solely on financial need.
At some colleges and universities, such aid is supplemented by outside fellowships or grants, a great many of them worth $1,000 or less. And a few, like DePaul University in Chicago, have a tuition grant program based on financial need but available only to minority students.
The announcement of a new intention to apply Federal anti-discrimination laws to minority scholarships arose after the Department of Education learned that organizers of the Fiesta Bowl, a Jan. 1 college football game to be played in Tempe, Ariz., were offering a $100,000 scholarship fund for minority students to the two universities that participate in the bowl.
Michael L. Williams, Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights, said in an interview on Tuesday that to give "race-exclusive" scholarships or ones based on ethnic origin was illegal because it would be discriminatory. He said institutions that issue such scholarships could lose their Federal financing.
 
Surprise and Strong Reactions
 Word of Mr. Williams's position caused strong reactions in academia and in Washington. On Wednesday, Lauro F. Cavazos resigned as Secretary of Education, apparently under pressure from President Bush's advisers, and perhaps in part because Mr. Cavazos had voiced doubts about Mr. Williams's position.
"This caught everyone by surprise," said Timothy Christensen, associate director for research and marketing for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. "There were no leaks or no advance warning that this was going to come out."
One result, he said, was that administrators across the country have been calling their lawyers for help and wondering what would become of decades of efforts with programs to help more minority students attend college.
At the University of Miami, which has 50 black scholarship students but no members of other minority groups on minority scholarships, the provost, Louis Glaser, said: "The law is the law. We will abide by it. But institutionally and personally we have always believed in giving help to minorities."
Tuition is $13,000 a year, and 60 percent of the college's 8,500 undergraduates receive some form of financial aid.
"As a private institution, our tuition is very high," Dr. Glaser said. "It will mean fewer minority students will attend the university, and minorities are already grossly underrepresented in the professional world."
He said the university would probably challenge the Department of Education's policy. Meanwhile, the university's scholarship obligations to minority students would be honored, he indicated.
"It would be unconscionable to cast out students to whom we have promised four years of support," Dr. Glaser said.
At the University of Pennsylvania, Ralph R. Smith, a professor of law, said: "It's obscene to use civil rights laws to support the exclusion of minority students from higher education."
"I see this as a continuation of the Bush Administration's policy of appeasement to the far right ideologues," Professor Smith said.
He accused the Administration of attempting to manipulate white Americans' fears as they see an economic downturn and a deterioration of their standard of living. People are being offered a "simplistic explanation that minority scholarships, welfare and quotas are to blame," he said. "It's not true."
Officials at many other universities expressed concern.
"For years colleges and universities have been making a concerted effort to increase the ranks of minority students and to make sure that they are funded at a level that will allow them to succeed academically," said John Schoultz, director of financial aid for DePaul. "All of a sudden the Government says you can't do that. It seems really contradictory."
Florida Atlantic University, a college in Boca Raton, Fla., with predominantly white students, has nine scholarships open only to blacks, Americans Indians or Hispanic students, officials said. Some were created to satisfy a 1978 Federal consent decree ordering the school to desegregate its student body. Such use of scholarships would still be permitted under Mr. Williams's new policy, he said Wednesday.
 
Minority Scholarships Praised
 But the university's president, Anthony J. Catanese, said he planned to continue using them even when the university has increased the number of minority students to the point where the Federal order ceases to require the scholarships. He added that the university intended to continue the scholarships despite the new policy "because it is the right thing to do."
"These scholarships have worked," said Dr. Catanese, noting that minority students now account for about 10 percent of the institution's 13,000 students. "Without them we never would have been able to attract minority students to our campus."
The scholarships were the subject of a complaint filed by the Washington Legal Foundation with the Education Department. The complaint challenged Florida Atlantic's minority scholarships as "reverse discrimination."

 BODY:
Chamber Improvisations
Arcado, Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, Manhattan, (212) 219-3055. One of the best small ensembles to come out of the late 1980's, Arcado works like a chamber group, but includes intense improvisations. The members -- Mark Dresser on bass, Mark Feldman on violin, Hank Roberts on cello -- swoop in and out of written sections that call to mind European classical composing as well as all sorts of other sources. The improvisations are American, and the group has a spectacular blend. The show tomorrow night starts at 9; tickets are $10.
 
A Gospel Bargain
 "Gospel, Africa and the Blues," S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, Manhattan, (212) 243-4940. A triple bill built for a recession: for $15, a listener gets the deep gospel fervor of Clarence Fountain and the Five Blind Boys, the blues-based secular eclecticism of the Holmes Brothers, and the soft folk of the Ugandan singer Samite. Mr. Fountain is a certified house rocker; the Holmes Brothers toss be-bop lines played on pedal steel guitar into the gospel harmonies and blues and soul songs, and Samite uses acoustic instruments to create a gentle mood. The show on Sunday night starts at 8.
 
Virtuoso With Quirks
Dorothy Donegan, Fortune Garden Pavilion, 209 East 49th Street in Manhattan, (212) 753-0101. Dorothy Donegan is one of jazz's great eccentrics, a musician fearless when it comes to improvising with tunes; she'll play a European classical run in the middle of a Duke Ellington piece, or throw in some boogie-woogie to mix things up. She's also a virtuoso, so her eclecticism is neither glib nor a mask. She's one of jazz's great undiscovered minds, and when she turns to glare at the audience, she's a terrific comedian as well. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 9:30 and 11; Sunday's shows are at 7, 8:30 and 10 P.M. THere is no cover charge; the minimum charge is $2o for the first two sets and $15 for the third set.

HEADLINE: Full-Size Sedan Shown by Ford

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Ford Motro Company today displayed its 1992 Ford Crown Victoria sedan, part of a new line of full-size cars.
Ford expects annual sales of 100,000 Crown Victorias, which have eight-cylinder engines, rear-wheel drive and seating for six.
"The Crown Victoria is the first major redesign of Ford's full-size, four-door family sedan since 1979," said Thomas Wagner, general manager of Ford division.
No price has been announced for the redesigned car. The 1991 model has a base price of about $18,000.
Full-size cars are among the most highly profitable vehicles sold in North America. Last month, Ford displayed the Crown Victoria's sister car, the Mercury Grand Marquis. Both are scheduled to begin production in Canada next month and will go on sales this spring.
Mr. Wagner said the fuel economy and performance of the new Crown Victoria have been improved by a 4.6-liter V-8 engine. The car has driver-and optional passenger-side airbags and antilock brakes.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF: LAST U.S. FLIGHT OF HOSTAGES, ENVOY ABOARD, GETS TO WEST;
Signal From Saudis

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In an effort to signal that it will accept nothing short of total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia has informed Algeria that a visit by its President, Chadli Benjedid, will serve no useful purpose unless President Saddam Hussein accepts the principle of total and unconditional withdrawal.
"He has not exactly been disinvited," an Arab official said. "He has simply been told that a visit to Riyadh would be useless and would encourage false hopes of a compromise if Iraq is not prepared to comply with the will of the international community and its resolution." 
 Mr. Benjedid was in Teheran tonight after visiting Amman and Baghdad in an effort to find a peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis before the Jan. 15 deadline authorizing United Nations member states to use force to secure Iraq's withdrawal. The Algerian leader is also scheduled to visit Oman.
Arab mediation has been viewed by Arab diplomats in the region and by some American officials in Washington as the best hope of avoiding a military confrontation. President Bush announced on Nov. 30 that he was inviting the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, to Washington for direct talks and was prepared to send Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to Baghdad. But the two governments continue to bicker over the timing of the meetings.
In a speech on Sunday, King Hussein of Jordan praised the Bush Administration for what he called the end of the "embargo on dialogue."
But there appears to be widespread discontent among Saudi, Egyptian and Syrian officials and other Arab members of the anti-Iraq coalition, which does not include Jordan, about Mr. Bush's failure to discuss his initiative before making it public.
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that the prospect of direct dialogue might have inadvertently increased the chance of war by leading Saddam Hussein to think that by "hanging tough and talking and talking, he can come out of this with a face-saver."
"I'm persuaded that Saddam believes that the alliance is going to back down," the official said, "that Saddam Hussein and King Hussein have misread the signals."
But this miscalculation could be dangerous, the official warned. "If he believes that the alliance against him will back down," he said of Mr. Hussein. "He won't give an inch."
 
 Hussein Says He Wants Peace
NICOSIA, Cyprus, Dec. 13 (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein said today that his country wanted peace but that it would gladly wage war rather than permit foreign domination of Arab oil or land.
"We want peace, endeavor to achieve it, and work to reach a point where no one of us brandishes his sword against the other," Mr. Hussein said in remarks carried by the official Iraqi press agency. "But if the enemies want to push affairs to a military duel, then by God's help we would win and would walk over their corpses and tread on their heads."
The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Mr. Hussein told his Cabinet that Iraq's enemies did not want it to remain an economic, military or political power because they believe it is a danger they should not permit in the region.

HEADLINE: Remember the Refuseniks?

 BODY:
Another foreign fantasy has erupted into fact. Two fantasies, actually, and their realization warrants reflection. In 1974, a handful of brave Soviet Jews haunted foreign embassies in Moscow hoping for exit visas. Refuseniks, they were called; the Brezhnev Government wouldn't let them out. 
 Who could have dreamed that one day, Soviet Jews by the thousands would be pouring into tents in Israel? And who would have imagined that the United States and the Soviet Union, after their harsh confrontation over the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, would stand allied against a common adversary in the Middle East?
Yet there stood President Bush Wednesday announcing his waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment restricting aid to the Soviet Union -- just as the flood of Soviet emigres to Israel is transforming Soviet-Israeli relations. The pace of change in the post-cold-war world is accelerating.
The 1974 amendment sponsored by Senator Henry Jackson of Washington and Representative Charles Vanik of Ohio, both Democrats, barred favorable trade treatment for Communist countries unless they made it easier for dissidents to leave. Jackson-Vanik eventually became the very symbol of a cold war turning colder.
By waiving Jackson-Vanik, Mr. Bush has now cleared the way for $1 billion in credits to Moscow to supply its people with food. The aid will demonstrate American concern to the Soviet people, beset by shortages. That can only advance a long-lasting thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations.
Israeli-Soviet relations are breaking through the permafrost, too. Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, publicly backs food aid for the Soviet people, and the Jewish Agency is sending 25 tons of fruit, vegetables and powdered milk.
Jackson-Vanik was never more than an irritant, and hardly a spur to emigration. The flow of Soviet emigres rose and fell with the ups and downs in U.S.-Soviet relations. In 1972, with the signing of SALT I, 32,000 Soviet Jews were allowed out. In 1974, when Jackson-Vanik was voted, departures fell to 21,000, then to 13,000 in 1975.
With the 1978 wheat deal, the outflow jumped to 29,000, and with the 1979 strategic arms treaty, to 51,000. Then came the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and an American wheat embargo; the number dropped again, to 21,000.
With the renewed arms race of the Reagan Administration, it plummeted to less than 1,000. But after the 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit meeting in Reykjavik the number rose again, to 8,000 in 1988, 71,000 in 1989 and an astounding 150,000 or more this year.
Unlike the refuseniks of 1974, many of today's Soviet emigres are Jewish in name only and regard Israel as a refuge from the reeling Soviet economy and rising ethnic tension. And many more are likely to leave; the Soviet Government has proposed a law easing emigration generally.
Repeal of Jackson-Vanik need not await its enactment. Indeed, that law now has European neighbors worried about a rush to the exits by Soviet citizens. Western aid, if it spurs Moscow's economic reforms, could make the Soviet Union more habitable for all its people, including Soviet Jews. Now, in 1990, that seems a possible dream.

BOC Group Names New Chief Executive

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The BOC Group, an international producer of industrial gas and health-care products, said yesterday that it had named Patrick Rich to be chief executive, succeeding Richard V. Giordano.
Mr. Rich, 59 years old, is currently deputy chairman of the company, whose world headquarters is in Windlesham, England. Its United States operations are based in Murray Hill, N.J. 
 He will succeed Mr. Giordano on Jan. 1 as chief executive. The company said that Mr. Giordano, 58, would continue as chairman for a year before retiring, and that Mr. Rich would then succeed him in that post, too.
In 1978, Mr. Giordano was chief executive of Airco, an industrial gas company in the United States in which BOC had a 35 percent stake. When BOC, formerly the British Oxygen Company, sought all of the company, Mr. Giordano resisted, but BOC won. Rather than losing his job, Mr. Giordano was kept on and made managing director of BOC in 1979. He was named chairman in 1984.
In October, a survey by Charterhouse, a British merchant banking company, ranked him seventh in earnings, with an annual salary of $1.7 million, among Americans running British companies.
In yesterday's announcement, Mr. Giordano did not state why he wished to retire, except to say he had hoped to do so at the end of last year and had stayed on for business reasons.
Mr. Rich, who is based in England, has a cosmopolitan background. Born in Strasbourg, France, he has degrees in political science, European studies and law from Strasbourg University. He was also a Fulbright scholar, studying economics at Harvard. In addition to French and English, he is fluent in German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese.
After service in Algeria with a French paratroop brigade, he took a job in Canada at Alcan Aluminum Ltd. as a project analyst and after 18 months in Montreal was transferred to Guinea to run an Alcan project.
His next stop was London, and in 1965 he was transferred to South America and then Spain. Back in Canada in 1976, he joined the Alcan board and continued his move upward at the company, taking six months out in 1982 to become an executive in residence at the Harvard Business School.
Mr. Rich left Alcan in 1986 to head Societe Generale de Surveillance Holding S.A., a Geneva-based service company. In 1983, he was named a director of the BOC Group, and he joined BOC full time in April this year as deputy chairman.

HEADLINE: Frank Bourgin, 80, Belatedly Honored Historian

BYLINE: By JOAN COOK

 BODY:
Frank P. Bourgin, a former Federal official whose received his doctoral degree in 1988, 44 years after it had been denied, died Wednesday at Chevy Chase House, a retirement home in Washington. He was 80 years old.
Mr. Bourgin died of pancreatic cancer, his brother, Simon, of Washington, said. 
 In 1944 Mr. Bourgin's academic career at the University of Chicago was interrupted when his doctoral dissertation was rejected by a faculty committee. The dissertation rebutted the idea that President Franklin D. Roosevelt's social reform programs were a departure from the intentions of the founding fathers. Mr. Bourgin argued that the framers of the Constitution were committed to government intervention for development, a view that other historians have since come to share.
Abandoning his academic career in political science, Mr. Bourgin became wartime historian for the Army quartermaster office in Chicago, and operated a chain of clothing stores in northern Minnesota. In 1963 he joined the Office of Emergency Management, based in Battle Creek, Mich. From 1970 until his retirement in 1983 Mr. Bourgin was program officer in the Washington office, responsible for preparing emergency plans.

 In 1985, with the approach of the Constitution's Bicentennial, he brought his thesis to the attention of Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian. Mr. Schlesinger assured him that he was "a true pioneer in the reconstruction of the early economic policy of the republic," and asked the University of Chicago to reconsider his case.
"Even after 45 years," Mr. Schlesinger wrote, his thesis makes "a fresh contribution to the political and economic history of the early republic."
In June 1988, the University of Chicago granted Mr. Bourgin, then 77 years old. his Ph.D. His thesis was published, to warm reviews, as "The Great Challenge: The Myth of Laissez Faire in the Early Years of the Republic" (1989; George Braziller).
Besides his brother, he is survived by two daughters, Marilyn Israel of Minneapolis, and Claudia Sandonato of Southfield, Mich.; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Jonathan Daniels, 26, Is Killed in Avalanche

 BODY:
Jonathan B. Daniels, a former Wall Street investment banker and a mountain-climbing enthusiast, died on Sunday in an avalanche in the Tatra Mountains on the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia. He was 26 years old and lived in Boston.
Mr. Daniels had been in Warsaw since late November with the Task Force for Company Assistance, a partnership of North American and Polish interests seeking to help Polish industry convert to private ownership in a market economy. Last weekend he was with three other Americans on a climbing trip when the avalanche struck, his family said. His companions were apparently unhurt.
He was born in Boston and graduated in 1986 with highest honors from Dartmouth, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He worked for the Wall Street firms of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and Bear Stearns before leaving on a round-the-world mountain-climbing trip 14 months ago. He spent the last year in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Daniels is survived by his father, Belden, and his mother, Pamela, of Boston, and a brother, Andrew, of Watertown, Mass.

HEADLINE: Inflation Fears Depress U.S. Debt Issues

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Renewed inflation fears depressed prices of long-term Treasury debt issues yesterday and ended a week of generally declining interest rates.
Fears that the uptick in inflation would inhibit further moves by the Federal Reserve to ease credit eroded prices of Treasury bills, which are as sensitive to Fed policy moves as bonds are to inflation trends. 
 Treasury bond prices began falling at the opening after Washington reported unexpectedly sharp rises of five-tenths of 1 percent in both the overall and core components of the Producer Price Index for November.
 
Large Declines Cited
 Dealers said the selling would have been even greater except for the large declines in industrial production and the use of factory capacity that the Government also reported. The 1.7 percent drop in industrial output last month was he largest since the decline of 2 percent in December 1982, a time of deep recession.
"Also depressing bond prices was some carry-over profit taking that began Thursday," said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. "What limited the selling, aside from the industrial output and capacity figures, was the realization that much of the jump in November wholesale prices was caused by one-time factors, such as the rises in cars and tobacco product prices."
Mr. Ricchiuto noted that tobacco companies moved up their planned price rises rather than have them coincide with the Federal and other tobacco taxes that are scheduled to go into effect after Jan. 1.
In any case, late trading found the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, being offered at 106 9/32, down 25/32 on the day, after declining as much as a full point, or $10 per $1,000 of face value, early in the session. The long bond's yield climbed to 8.18 percent, from 8.11 percent on Thursday and compared with 8.17 percent a week ago.
The Treasury's long notes, the 8.5's of November 2000, declined by 13/32, at 103 8/32, for a yield of 8.01 percent, unchanged from a week ago. By comparison, the yield on Japan's competitive 10-year long bonds fell to 7.14 percent, from 7.21 percent a week ago, while the yield on the 10-year German long bonds dropped to 8.62 percent from 8.77 percent.
At the short end of the Treasury debt market, the discount rate on 90-day bills rose two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.86 percent; the six-month bills rose by six basis points, to 6.77 percent, and the one-year bills rose four basis points, to 6.65 percent.
Meanwhile, the Fed, which touched off a strong rally in fixed-income debt issues the preceding Friday by easing credit, did not intervene in the money market yesterday. Dealers said the Fed was apparently satisfied that Federal funds traded at 7.25 percent for most of the day before moving up to 7 5/16 percent at the close. The 7.25 percent rate is now perceived to be the Fed's current target for what is considered the bedrock cost of credit: the rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans.
A feature of the corporate debt market was the pricing of an issue of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, through GMAC Grantor Trust 1990-A, of $1.057 billion in pass-through certificates backed by receivables on cars and light trucks. An underwriting group led by the First Boston Corporation priced the 8.75 percent certificates, which have an average life of 1.78 years, at 99.59375, to yield 8.443 percent. The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Sales Abound, but Retailing Lags

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
With the holiday shopping season limping along much more slowly than retailers had hoped, and their hopes fading for a last-minute turnaround, many stores have been forced into the very tactics they swore they would avoid: slashing their prices and advertising sale after sale.
But even that usually reliable recipe does not seem to be working very well. So, with a little more than a week left to Christmas, frustrated merchants across the country have already used up most of their limited bag of tricks to increase buying. 
 "Business is not so hot," said James F. Nordstrom, a co-chairman of Nordstrom Inc. who is known for his plain-spoken candor. "We keep asking ourselves why and have no answers. Our stores seem full of people. They like what they see. But the sales results are less than we hoped."
 
 Big Move by Sears
 Still, Mr. Nordstrom said he saw no reason to change strategy at the Seattle-based fashion chain, which is holding fewer sales than most of its counterparts. He said he plans only to continue to "make our merchandise seem as attractive as we can."
Executives from stores of all stripes have similar laments. As a result, store executives and industry analysts say they doubt whether the final days, including the crucial Dec. 21-23 weekend, will be strong enough to pull the season up over last year.
A big confirmation of how bad sales are came last week when Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's largest retailer, shocked the industry by announcing that it was moving its "after Christmas sale" to before Christmas.
Not all major chains followed Sears, but some did. Store executives and industry analysts say the results have been disappointing.
"The price cutting is stimulating traffic into the sores but the sales results are less than retailers had hoped they would be," said Richard E. Pyle, managing director of Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, a Minneapolis stock brokerage. "Even the promotions aren't opening the customers' pocketbooks as much as they did last year."
Some retail marketers say they are not surprised, and say that many merchants lack the creativity needed to overcome the slump.
"Constant price cutting is the typical fear strategy," said Wendy Liebmann, a New York retail marketing consultant. "Too many retail executives, knowing that they were heading into a difficult season, adopted a defensive strategy by limiting their stocks and hoping to move them with markdowns, instead of taking creative steps."
 
 Sales Explosion Seen
 A wide spectrum of retailers, from mass merchandisers like Sears to major clothing retailers like J. C. Penney, to higher-priced fashion chains like Nordstrom report that their sales so far this season are running either slightly behind or about the same as last year. And when retail executives say "flat" sales, they are really acknowledging that revenues will be behind last year when adjusted for inflation.
Generally, pessimism appears to be growing, a significant development in an industry known for its almost relentess optimism and often rosy sales forecasts even in very slow economic conditions.
As pervasive as price cutting already is, retailers and analysts say they expect an explosion of sales this coming weekend and the final pre-Christmas weekend.
Retailers have kept their holiday inventories much tighter than in recent years, hoping this time to avoid a barrage of sales. But slow business is causing those stocks to mount, creating another reason to slash prices.
There are exceptions. A few stores that appeal primarily to affluent and fashion-oriented women, like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's, say business is improving. On the other hand, stores that sell expensive men's clothing, like Paul Stuart and Louis of Boston, report that sales are only equal to last year's, reflecting a deep recession in men's clothing directly related to economic concerns.
 
 Some Latitude in Cuts
 Still, even having to resort to more price cuts than they had hoped might not be a fatal blow to profits, some retail executives said.
One reason is that the markdowns are more often on a narrower range of goods than advertisements make it appear.
And even cutting prices on bread-and-butter items can be done with some latitude. For example, an item may cost a retailer $50 from the supplier. If he sells it for $100, he can easily take off as much as 35 percent from the original selling price and still make a profit. For most stores, it is only when additional markdowns reach 40 percent and more that the profit falls to a critical level.
For all this, stores are trying to maintain full price on goods like top-name sportswear and furnishings, underwear, linens, hosiery, housewares and furniture. Thus the mixture of sale and regular-price merchandise still yields enough of a markup to keep a store's earnings relatively high.
Chief competitors of Sears, like Montgomery Ward, the K Mart Corporation and the J. C. Penney Company said that they did not plan to follow suit at this time, but would monitor the effects of the Sears action.
"Of course, we can't sit still when a big competitor does something like that, but we have already added some categories of merchandise to our price promotions such as apparel and home furnishings," said Ann Raives, Ward's vice president for corporate planning.
At Sears, Matt Howard, senior vice president for marketing of the Merchandising Group, said that the holiday season was running "slightly below our expectations but we are optimistic that the final weekend, with three full shopping days, will make a major difference."
 
 Penney's Sees Decline
 Even though Sears switched to what it calls "everyday low pricing" a few years ago, it is not considered a discount chain like K Mart. Sears's change in policy implied it would need to hold few sales, but analysts said this concept had created some confusion among consumers. Sears officials insist that they plan to continue sales as circumstances warrant.
At J. C. Penney, with headquarters in Dallas, Robert Gill, the vice chairman, said that business was slow. Even with a hoped-for gain in sales of 3 to 5 percent in December, he said, Penney's expected a profit decline in the final quarter.
A spokeswoman for K Mart, based in Troy, Mich., said business was "in line with last year," and that merchandise inventories were in "better shape," a positive factor. "Comparatively," she said, "there's little pressure on us to take a lot of markdowns."
One discount men's wear chain, NBO Stores, says it may have hit on a sales promotion that is working.
"We have a shot at getting at least 10 percent sales jump over last year," said Eugene Kosack, the president and chief executive, "We had originally expected the season to produce a slight decline." He said the key for NBO was a "buy one, get one free" sale. First it was buy one shirt or tie and get one free. Now, Mr. Kosack said, shoppers are responding well to "buy a sports shirt and take home a sweater free."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed, Gold Rises And Silver Drops Below $4

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday against foreign currencies amid new doubts over whether diplomatic talks between the United States and Iraq would succeed.
Gold was higher, closing up by $2.40 a troy ounce, to $376.70, on the Commodity Exchange.
But silver prices sank below $4 an ounce on the lack of decisive Persian Gulf moves and a large selloff by institutional investors. Over the last few days, silver has traded at the lowest price levels in 16 years. 
 The dollar strengthened as traders anticipated Middle East tough talk from President Bush at a news conference, but the currency eased in value when the Bush comments showed he was not yet ready to scrap the diplomacy option. Mr. Bush scolded President Saddam Hussein of Iraq for failing to agree on a date for the diplomatic trip to Baghdad by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
"The dollar came off a little bit after over-anticipating," said Francoise Soares-Kemp, manager of the corporate advisory desk at Credit Suisse in New York. "Bush was tough, but he didn't declare war in the next 24 hours."
Over all, the dollar gained against the yen, which has generally weakened on Mideast war fears because Japan's economy is so dependent on imported oil. The dollar closed at 132.85 yen in New York, up from late Thursday's 132.17. In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.57 yen, to a closing 131.87 yen and, later in London, it was quoted at 132.85 yen.
Jitters in Eastern Europe, particularly unrest in Albania, helped the dollar against European currencies.
The dollar moved slightly higher against the German mark, closing at 1.4825 marks compared with late Thursday's 1.4790. But the dollar also strengthened against the British pound in New York, with sterling weakening to $1.9370 from late Thursday's $1.9450.
Brokers said the dollar also got support from the rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for November, when an increase of only one-tenth was expected. The poor performance suggested the Federal Reserve might have less room to lower interest rates, traders said. Higher interest rates generally make a currency more attractive.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's prices, included: 1.2735 Swiss francs, up from 1.2660; 5.0405 French francs, up from 5.0255; 1,119.75 Italian lire, up from 1,115.25, and 1.1583 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1607.
Gold rose in New York, closing up by $2.40 a troy ounce, to $376.70, on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $375.75, up $2.40 from late Thursday.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Endorses Trump's Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump got approval yesterday from New Jersey regulators for a deal to rescue the Taj Mahal casino, and people close to the Trump Organization said he might surprise the bondholders of another of his Atlantic City casinos, Trump's Castle, by making an $18.4 million payment due today.
The Trump Organization is believed to be sitting on millions in cash from earnings of its various properties. The interest and principal payments of many of these operations were suspended or reduced as part of a bank loan package that rescued the financier last summer. 
 If the $18.4 million payment is made, it will be a departure from the recent rounds of crisis deal-making that have entangled the developer much of the year. The first round of crisis talks began in the spring, when Mr. Trump informed his bankers that he could not make a $43 million interest payment on the Castle bonds. This time, Mr. Trump has until Monday to make the Castle payment because the due date falls on a weekend. If he fails to make the payment on Monday, he will have a 10-day grace period before the Castle can be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.
Last evening the New Jersey Casino Control Commission approved a slightly modified version of the plan agreed to last month by Mr. Trump and holders of $675 million of high-yield, "junk bonds" he sold to finance the completion of his extravagant Taj Mahal casino on Atlantic City's Boardwalk. Among the changes in the plan, Mr. Trump will now have an additional year for the bonds to mature instead of the additional two years granted initially.
Last month, Mr. Trump, who could not make a $47.3 million payment on his Taj Mahal bonds, narrowly escaped having that casino forced into bankruptcy by making a deal with bondholders. As part of the deal, he had to give up 50 percent of his equity and could eventually lose control if the casino fails to meet certain earnings projections. In exchange, bondholders reduced the interest rate on the bonds, extended their maturity, and agreed to return 30 percent of the equity they got in the deal if the casino manages to pay the original 14 percent interest rate over the next decade.
Among the other changes brought about by the commission, Mr. Trump will lose the ability to get back 30 percent of the equity in the Taj if for any reason his bankers foreclose on the property. In that event, the interest rate on the bonds would revert to the original 14 percent, the bondholders would automatically get control of the company and they would be given the right to terminate Mr. Trump's management contract.
On Monday about $16 million in interest payments is also due on about $250 million of high-yield bonds sold to finance the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City. Trump Plaza bondholders largely expect that $16 million payment to be made and unlike the Castle bondholders they have not set up a creditors' committee or retained legal and financial counsel.
People familiar with the Castle bondholders' committee said the bondholders had had almost no substantive negotiations with Trump Organization executives and the rudimentary financial reviews that are common in these situations have not yet been completed. Calls to representatives of several Castle bondholders were not returned.

HEADLINE: Drink-Box Makers Fighting Back

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Faced with one statewide ban and the prospect of others, the companies that make the increasingly popular containers known as drink boxes are moving to counter criticism that the containers cannot easily be recycled.
The airtight boxes, which can preserve liquids for as long as six to nine months without refrigeration and have become a staple for products like Gatorade, Mott's apple juice and Hawaiian Punch, are made of layers of paper, plastic and aluminum. Environmentalists favor packages made of a single material, like aluminum, glass or plastic, over multilayer containers because there are no dissimilar materials to be separated before recycling. And with aluminum and glass, the material can be made again into containers, whereas the recycled drink boxes are put to more limited uses, like plastic lumber.
 
Wrapping Product in Flag
 But in newspaper advertisements, and in pilot recycling programs in Rhode Island and California, the industry producing the boxes, known as aseptic packages, has tried to make the case that they are environmentally benign. The industry has even wrapped its product in the flag, noting that American troops in Saudi Arabia are drinking their milk from such boxes. 
 The aseptic-packaging industry's actions are only the latest example of an industry trying to defend its market niche by associating itself with recycling. Makers of the plastic foam used to package electronic instruments and McDonald's hamburgers have also set up recycling centers to enhance the environmental image of the material. (Even so, McDonald's recently decided to switch from foam back to paper packaging.) And big consumer-products companies like Procter & Gamble and Lever Brothers are emphasizing the use of recycled plastic in packaging like detergent containers.
Tetra Pak Inc., the largest producer of the boxes, and Combibloc Inc., the other major producer, have been running full-page newspaper advertisements extolling the benefits and environmental compatibility of the packages. One recent one was headlined: "Drink boxes are as easy to recycle as this page." But environmental advocates say that unlike newspapers multimaterial boxes are too complex to be recycled economically without industry subsidies.
The aseptic-box producers' claims are not escaping government scrutiny. Last week, New York City's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, Mark Green, filed a complaint against the two major manufacturers, charging that their ads constituted deceptive trade practices. "These companies are unfairly capitalizing on pro-environment consumer sentiment to create the false impression that their products are benign," Mr. Green said in a statement.
 
 Report by Officials
 The claims may also draw the attention of a group of state attorneys general who have been cracking down on misleading environmental claims. The group, which includes New York's Attorney General, Robert Abrams, and nine others, recently issued a report concluding that "environmental claims relating to disposability should not be made unless the advertised disposal option is currently available to consumers in the area in which the product is sold."
Although almost anything can be recycled in theory, environmentally conscious specialists on solid waste say that unless a recycling program was economical, it would probably collapse once subsidies from producers were withdrawn.
The aseptic-packaging industry is sponsoring a variety of pilot recycling projects, said Edward A. Klein, president of the Aseptic Packaging Council and vice president of Tetra Pak. School children in North Kingstown, R.I., are depositing the multilayer boxes into containers that also collect plastic waste. From there packages are shipped to a plant operated by National Waste Technologies in Ronkonkoma, L.I., where they are combined with other plastics and made into artificial wood.
Warren C. Tyler, the president of Combibloc, acknowledged that the Rhode Island program involved a subsidy, but said the Contra Costa program was self-sustaining because of the value of the paper pulp recovered from the boxes and milk cartons. "Those materials are worth $120 a ton when they have been shredded and baled," he said. "And as pulp it sells for $400 a ton."
He characterized the Rhode Island program as "an early demonstration" and said, "We do not see it as a model for the future."
Mr. Klein said the industry expected that the recycling would be economical after an initial period of subsidy. "We hope to demonstrate within six months to a year that the recycling can be conducted on a self-sustaining basis," he said. "We will not abandon this program."
But the aseptic packagers "have drawn a very big conclusion about recycling from a very small demonstration project," said Allen Hershkowitz, a scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It is very marginal in a commercial sense."
Erica Guttman, an official of Rhode Island's Solid Waste Management Corporation, said the collection effort was mounted this autumn after legislation was proposed to ban aseptic packaging in that state. Earlier this year, Maine adopted such a ban. Environmental advocates said attempts would be made to enact similar bans in other states in 1991.

HEADLINE: Albany Plan Focuses on Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 14

 BODY:
While differing in many specifics from the plan outlined by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last month, the sweeping deficit-closing measure approved by the State Legislature early today achieves the same broad objectives he laid out.
It focuses mainly on the spending side of New York's budget, not on new taxes or borrowing, to bridge what is a $1 billion chasm between the state's projected revenues and its expenditures this year. In fact, the Legislature adopted by far the largest package of midyear spending cuts in the state's history, and many fiscal monitors praised the Governor and lawmakers today for showing such discipline. 
 The plan also avoids many of the one-shot, cash-generating budget manipulations that have raised credit analysts' eyebrows in the past, although it did contain one controversial provision: State employees will be required to defer a week's pay now, in return for an extra week's pay at their prevailing salary when they retire.
But despite lawmakers' general belt-tightening, the measure enacted shortly after 4 A.M. today may be only a prelude to an even more painful period of budget cutting in Albany. One lawmaker described it as a warm-up drill for the coming fiscal year's budget, which some officials say may have a deficit of up to $3 billion.
 
'Next Year Will Be Wide Open'
 And many of those who will feel the impact of today's cuts most severely -- school districts, hospitals, local governments and some private social-service organizations -- could well endure worse cuts next year, officials said today. That is especially true for New York City, which is mired in its own budget problems and lost $70 million in school money in today's package.
"This is just the first in a series of difficult decisions," said Carl Carlucci, the secretary of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. "Next year will be wide open. When the economy was expanding in New York, there was an expansion of services. But when you're in a contracting economy, you have got to look at a contraction in the range of services you deliver."
Among the more striking changes from the Governor's proposed package is the deferred-pay plan, which the Legislature adopted instead of Mr. Cuomo's proposal to place all state employees on mandatory unpaid one-week furloughs. Today, the Governor defended the revised plan, often described as a lag payroll, by noting that it saved the same amount of money, about $150 million, would not roll a cash deficit into the next fiscal year and "even provides greater productivity than furloughs would."
The Legislature also came up with an alternative formula for distributing cuts in aid to the state's hospitals and nursing homes.
 
Hospital Plan Changed
 Under the Governor's proposal, Medicaid rates would have been reduced in such a way that hospitals would have gotten lower payments not only from the state government, but from the Federal and local governments and private insurers as well. The new plan leaves the Medicaid rates unchanged but imposes a flat assessment on hospital revenues that produces roughly the same savings, $125 million, projected in the Mr. Cuomo's plan.
While the Governor's plan envisioned cuts of about $80 million in state aid to public universities, the Legislature authorized a $300-a-year tuition increase that would help offset much of the effect of the reductions. Annual tuition at the State University of New York has been $1,350 since 1983, and at the City University of New York, $1,250.
The Governor, who last year vetoed authorization for a $200 annual increase, said this afternoon that he had consistently fought against any increases but that "today's difficult circumstances require a relaxation of that constraint."
The plan also includes some -- but not all -- of the fiscal-relief measures for local governments sought by the Governor, which he said would help to offset the state aid cuts they are asked to sustain.
 
No More Rabbits From Hat
 For instance, regulations that require New York City teachers to participate in an extensive mentoring program were lifted. City Board of Education officials said the change could save them as much as $10 million in the current fiscal year.
While congratulating themselves on showing the fortitude to approve such heavy cuts, top lawmakers already seemed to be focusing on next year's budget deliberations, which will begin in early February with Gov. Cuomo's proposal of a budget for the 1991-92 fiscal year.
"I think this process has shown two things," Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said in an interview. "It shows that we can make very difficult decisions in a relatively short period of time. And I think it shows a growing reality that in dealing with the budgets we can't keep pulling rabbits out of a hat. We have to cut."
Mr. Miller said that instead of relying on across-the-board cuts next year, the Legislature was likely to eliminate certain programs, although he declined to identify specific targets. For example, rather than "watering down" five different programs with cuts of 20 percent, he explained, it might make more sense to get rid of one program altogether.
The plan adopted today was generally endorsed by fiscal monitors who had criticized past state budgets. "This program is much much better than previous midyear corrections," said Cynthia Green, a senior analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission, a private monitoring group.
The president of the Business Council of New York State, Daniel B. Walsh, said the Legislature came up with "real, significant spending cuts" compared to those of earlier years.

HEADLINE: Moody's Cuts Debt Ratings Of Five Leading Insurers

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Services said yesterday that it had downgraded its ratings of the financial strength of five leading insurance companies.
Moody's said that the downgrading reflected concern over the near-term rise in problem assets in the insurers' mortgage portfolios and that the move had come after a three-month review. The rating agency said the move reflected the rising pressures on earnings and capital that the companies would face as a result of losses and delinquencies on mortgages. 
 The five are Mutual Life Insurance of New York, Mutual Benefit Life Insurance, Home Life Insurance, Equitable Life Assurance and Equitable Variable Life Insurance.
 
Drop in Profitability
 "What we expect is that the level of mortgages that are not performing as originally expected will go up for the rest of this year and into next year," said Weston Hicks, a Moody's vice president. "From a credit point of view it means that the profitability of these companies will go down and the margin of protection for policyholders -- retained earnings and surplus -- will also lessen."
Mr. Hicks added that the changes were still relatively modest and noted that the ratings still leave the companies within the categories of strong, investment-grade institutions. The Moody's report noted that the ultimate effect of growing nonperforming mortgage loans on each insurance company would depend on how deep and protracted the current real estate recession turns out to be, each company's cash position, financial flexibility and earnings outlook, and regulatory pressures.
Moody's noted that because typical life insurance commercial mortgage commitments were made on established, income-producing properties, insurers have weathered previous real estate downturns largely unscathed. However, Moody's argued that the present downturn would be more severe than in the past and it expected greater insurer losses.
Moody's also said the ratings of other big life insurers with large mortgage portfolios were also confirmed by the study. The Aetna Life and Casualty Company's financial strength rating was confirmed, but Moody's lowered Aetna's senior debt rating because of similiar concerns over its mortgage portfolio.

HEADLINE: Impromptu Air Trips? Possible, but Not Easy

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Last-minute vacation flights during the Christmas-New Year holiday, especially to Florida and the Caribbean, are at a premium. They can be found, even a rare few at bargain prices, but travelers will have to look hard and be flexible.
Most discount fares are long gone, although some might become available just before a planned departure date. And fares in general continue to cover wide ranges, with such a variety of prices charged on most popular routes that even sophisticated travelers may be thoroughly confused.
 
Be Wary of Airline Promotions
 The lowest fares are generally nonrefundable, must be bought in advance and limit departures to the middle of the week. But even so, because a majority of the holiday flights will be heavily booked, the airlines are setting aside just a handful of inexpensive seats from their remaining inventory. 
 Don't be confused by new promotions that some airlines are offering. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and United Airlines are offering members of their frequent-flier clubs a free ticket for making as few as two round-trip flights between today and March 15. But the free tickets will be only for travel starting in the middle of next year.
The problems that last-minute travelers are likely to face in the next three weeks come at a time of unusual turmoil for the airline industry. Overall airline fares have risen by at least 15 percent since fuel prices rose abruptly after Iraq invaded Kuwait last summer, one of the biggest increases in history over such a short period.
In addition, less than two weeks ago Continental Airlines, the nation's fifth-largest air carrier, filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws, succumbing to the double pressure of higher fuel costs and a weakening economy.
 
Few Seats, Fewer Bargains
 "Travel for the holidays, -- it's very rough," said Phil Davidoff, the owner of Belair Travel, an agency in Bowie, Md., and president of the American Society of Travel Agents. "If you want to go outbound from Dec. 21 to Dec. 24 and want to return on Jan. 1 or Jan. 2, you're going to pay top dollar."
Lorna Greene, a travel agent at Reliable Travel in Cedarhurst, L.I., put it this way: "Never mind any kind of bargains. How about a seat? People are saying to their travel agents, 'Just find me something.' "
So the first advice for anyone looking for airline seats to a popular warm-weather vacation spot in the next few weeks is: Be willing to make changes. Be prepared to fly on a different day, at a different hour and probably on a different airline than you had sought.
"It's a trial-and-error kind of thing," said Julia Nystrand, director of electronic services for the Official Airline Guide, which compiles information on airline fares and schedules.
John Unger, president of the Travel Network, a travel agency in Tampa, Fla., said: "Tell your travel agent that you are flexible on either side of the trip. Ask the agent to take a look at the availabilities and give the agent time to do the research."
If you get a reservation, though, expect to pay one of the highest fares. For example, round-trip coach fares from New York to Orlando, Fla., or Fort Lauderdale, Fla., currently range from $198 to $664.
"If you look at the fine print, you see that airlines say 'prices from,' " said Marilyn B. Cicero, president of Colpitts Travel Center, a travel agency in Lexington, Mass. "People call expecting the discounted fares and they just won't find it. It takes a lot of explaining on our part."
Nevertheless, some travelers find bargains. Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for American, suggested that travelers who are willing to book flights on their own "call reservation agents and ask them to search for the lowest possible price."
"They have short cuts to find the discount fares and the flights that they are available on," she said.
A tougher approach was recommended by Christopher J. Witkowski, director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, an organization founded by Ralph Nader. "Consumers who call an airline in response to an advertisement, particularly when the ad appears that day, should be insistent on getting either the reservation agent or his supervisor to honor the advertised fare," he said.
"If the low fare is sold out and the consumer cannot afford the higher fare, that should be made clear to the agent or supevisor," Mr. Witkowski said. "You might just land a lower fare in the last few days."
That, however, means travelers have to be able and willing to wait and content to spend the holidays where they are if nothing works out.
Another way to get to a holiday destination, possibly at a discounted price when flights are otherwise fully booked, is to take a package tour. Travel agencies often offer packages combining air fare, hotel and possibly other vacation expenses, and tour wholesalers sometimes sell these packages directly to the public.
Joel Cutler, president of the Vacation Outlet at Filene's Basement in Boston, said his agency is now selling one-week packages from Boston to Cancun, Mexico, starting Dec. 21, that are "hundreds of dollars" less than they would be if the various elements were bought separately. One package consisting of air fare and seven nights at an "inexpensive" hotel costs $429, based on double occupancy, while another at a "moderate" hotel costs $529.

New Air Bag Called Cheaper and Safer

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Stern & Stern Industries, a small company in New York City that makes products using specialized woven fabrics, obtained a patent this week for an automobile air bag that it said was cheaper and safer than the bags now in use.
Because air bags need to inflate in about one-tenth of a second, they employ propellant gases that essentially explode when they are activated by electrical voltage and produce a brief burst of enormous heat. Current bags handle that strain because they are made of fabrics that have plastic coatings, but the inventors of the new bag contend that these coatings are bulky, expensive to apply and pose ventilation problems. The new bag is made of uncoated fabrics consisting of tightly woven polyester or nylon. 
 Peter B. Thornton, the company's president and one of the inventors, said the chief advantage of the new bag was its ability to deflate at just the right speed. Air bags need to begin deflating almost immediately after a crash, so people do not feel as if they are hitting a brick wall. Because plastic coatings do not let any air escape, he said, current bags are made with small round holes to allow for deflation. The problem, Mr. Thornton said, is that both air and propellant gases spew out of those holes at jet speeds and can actually burn the person being protected.
The new fabric is woven extremely tightly, and then subjected to heat and pressure that makes it become almost, but not quite, impermeable. As a result, Mr. Thornton said, the bag inflates as efficiently as current ones and deflates more efficiently.
Mr. Thornton said the General Motors Corporation and several air bag manufacturers had tested the bags and were interested in them.
Mr. Thornton, Stanley Cone and George Booz received patent 4,977,016.

Kindly Toward Arithmetic

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

 BODY:
Several engineers write that I am unfair to their profession. This follows my recent observation that afflictions like those proliferating and ridiculously complicated new telephone systems come about because "engineers refuse to leave well enough alone."
 Prof. Jerry Nathanson of Union County College in New Jersey, for instance, believes I have "a narrow-minded and pernicious anti-technology attitude." Worse, he thinks, I contribute to the decline in the number of Americans studying engineering. 
 This is alarming, because one of my few convictions about American education is that far too many people are frittering away college educations by studying history, literature and psychology when they should be studying engineering, mathematics and science.
 Living in a society where technological know-how is vital to people who want the good jobs, we graduate ever higher percentages of people ignorant of science, impotent in mathematics and incompetent at any technology more complex than changing a light bulb.
Everybody knows this, everybody says something must be done about it, and nothing seems to result. The problem doesn't excite the educational world as it did 30 years ago when the Soviets threatened to beat us in the race to the moon.
This isn't because American educators lack passion. To the contrary, they happen just now to be enjoying one of their periodic, exhilarating frenzies of self-examination, but if you're curious why the United States has trouble keeping pace with Japanese and European industry, the educational issues being debated may seem theologically abstruse. For instance:
 Which novelists should students be reading and which should be expelled from the curriculum? Whose version of history should be laid down as gospel and whose renounced as heresy?
 Yes, these are issues worth fretting about. They go to the sociological nature of education, dealing as they do with the question of whether some social blocs are empowered by educational systems, and others disempowered. (What is it about sociology that instantly bogs us down in fens of jargon?)
 The routes to empowerment, however, do not all run through the departments of literature and history. Ability to deliver the goods in a difficult job can also empower people, sometimes faster than substituting Du Bois for Milton can.
 So if Professor Nathanson is right about me discouraging people out there from studying engineering, or science, or math, I apologize. All I say to such people is, What's wrong with you anyhow? Are you so wishy-washy you can be turned away from a crack at a good life by a newspaper columnist?
 On Professor Nathanson's other point, I remain sassy. Complaining about engineering's refusal to leave well enough alone is neither "narrow-minded" nor perniciously "anti-technology."
 Its refusal to leave well enough alone may, in fact, be one thing that repels young people from engineering careers. "Why," they may ask, "should I spend my life making everybody else's life more complicated than it already is?"
 The curse of technology is its habit of trying to improve what it already does almost perfectly. The result: What was once simple becomes complicated. The improvement of a new phone system, for instance, typically makes it more complicated to use the phone than it was before improvement occurred.
 The benefits resulting from the complication -- financial advantage perhaps to large corporations, including telephone companies -- are hidden from those who have to learn all over again how to use the phone. The engineer's aim, Professor Nathanson, should be to create the hidden benefits without punishing the user.
 Engineering's low priority on simplicity leads to many modern nightmares: trying to program a VCR, for example. This can hardly be done without a degree in electronics. Even if you come close, you can't cope with those little power-company glitches that turn off the machine's idiot electric clock, thus wrecking the entire program.
 I know VCR's are all Japanese, but what a triumph for America if Professor Nathanson & Colleagues could design one that all humanity could work by just pushing a few buttons. Like the old telephone.

HEADLINE: Tribal Colleges Prepare Indians for Future

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert H. White's "Indians -- New Harvest" (Op-Ed, Nov. 22), on successful entrepreneurialism on American Indian reservations was welcome Thanksgiving reading. Economic revitalization and self-determination among native Americans is being fueled by the 27 tribally controlled colleges throughout the Midwest and West, most on reservations.
Hardly known outside of native America, these colleges began two decades ago with Navajo Community College and have been outstanding successes. Courses in math, science, sociology, business administration and English are offered alongside classes in native American history, literature and languages.
Many of the colleges also prepare students to join local industries. For example, Northwest Community College, serving the Lummi Indians of Washington, offers a certificate program in commercial fishing. Other colleges offer programs in ranching, agriculture and mining.
A student who attends a tribal college for even one year is 40 times more likely to succeed at a non-Indian institution than a student who enters one directly. More than 30 percent of tribal college graduates further their education, more than 80 percent are employed.
The 27 tribal colleges present a fresh outlook on the future of native Americans.

HEADLINE: Misguided 'Orphan Trains' Idea Rolls On;
Farms for the Homeless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Moving the Furniture Around," Anna Quindlen's Dec. 2 column about the homeless, prompts a suggestion: that cities or counties place the homeless on large farms, as was the custom many years ago. Almost every county had a "poor farm," like the one we had in Dodge County, Wisconsin, when I was a boy in the early part of the century. It was an economical and healthy way of providing for the destitute.
They had to work at repairing and painting buildings and equipment, making ice cream and butter, baking, sewing, canning vegetables and fruit, washing and serving at meals. The cost would be small, compared with housing the homeless in hotels; the counties could pay part of salaries (placed in savings accounts), which could help the occupants become self-sustaining.
The public would gladly support such a rehabilitation method, compared with a costly system that only creates perpetual care for the homeless.

HEADLINE: Access of the Poor to Quality Higher Education Is Imperiled

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Since 1847, The City College of New York has served a great American ideal. It has given the children of poor, largely immigrant families the chance to obtain a first-rate college education. In the process, it has educated some of our nation's most notable citizens -- people such as Jonas Salk, A. Philip Randolph, Upton Sinclair, Bernard Malamud and Felix Frankfurter.
Over the years, the college has played a large role within a growing City University, and the college's student population has changed. Today's students more frequently come from African, Asian and Latino cultures than from European backgrounds. But the college and university have maintained the primary mission of a quality education for those who can't otherwise afford it.
This year, however, the college and university have suffered damaging budget cuts at the hands of the state government. At City College, we will be forced to reduce course offerings, increase class sizes, lose journal subscriptions and cut back on already insufficient secretarial services. Moreover, we will be unable to hire young faculty members to replace those retiring. As a result, the college will lose some of its vitality, and be unable to bring in more women scholars and those of diverse cultural backgrounds. Equally serious problems confront the university as a whole. The proposed tuition increase would restore only a small fraction of the budget cuts, while creating new roadblocks for many students.
So far, the budget cuts have been made very quietly. There has been almost no vocal opposition. Indeed, the cuts have hardly made the news. Perhaps many people assume that, given all the other economic problems in our state, these cuts are of minor significance. But a critical issue is at stake: the access of the poor to a quality higher education. I hope those who care about this issue will begin to ask about the cuts and fight against them.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
G.O.P. Plagued With Democratic Problems

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
When William J. Bennett backed out of his agreement to become chairman of the Republican National Committee he was walking away from one of the biggest headaches in American politics right now.
The Republican Party is rife with problems that have long been associated with the Democrats: ideological schisms, personal bickering, pique parading as principle and individual agendas undermining party unity.
There is rising concern among Republicans around the country that at a time when the White House should be pulling the party together, the President is distracted by a range of foreign crises and his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, is more concerned with settling grudges with other powerful Republicans.
The absence of Lee Atwater, the party chief who is suffering from an inoperable brain tumor, has become glaringly apparent, many Republicans now say. Mr. Sununu has tried to consolidate the jobs of chief of staff and chief political adviser. This would be difficult for even the most light-footed of operatives. But politically minded Republicans say it has created nothing but grief under Mr. Sununu, who walks across political minefields with all the grace of a raging elephant.
Friends insist Mr. Bennett was telling the truth when he announced he could not succed Mr. Atwater because his concerns about conflict of interest would keep him from making as much money as he needed. But they also said that he had long discussions with associates about the seriousness of the party's internal divisions, and that this did nothing to encourage him to overcome the financial obstacles.
Indeed, officials in Mr. Sununu's office say they offered to more than double the chairman's salary, to $300,000, to entice Mr. Bennett. But that was said to be less than half of what he could make from speaking fees. So he walked away sending a letter of explanation to the President and holding a news conference in the White House driveway that only added to the sense that the Republican camp is in disarray.
"I would not characterize it as chaos," said Eddie Mahe, who helped run the Republican National Committee when Mr. Bush was its chairman. "But it surely could be characterized as confusion. There is no shining beacon on any hill that all forces are moving toward. It's just a mumbo jumbo of forces on a plain."
Some of the current problem goes to the very core of the party. Two of the bonding agents of the Republican coalition, opposition to communism and opposition to taxes, have been weakened, one as a result of world events and the other as a result of White House handling of the budget negotiations.
On top of these philosophical problems, and in several cases because of them, Washington is being treated to a series of Republican feuds of a sort remarkable even by Washington's standards of pigue, backbiting and infighting.
Some news from the battlefield:
*Two of the party's best known conservatives, Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development who was a Presidential candidate in 1988, and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip who hopes to be the next Republican leader of the House, openly rebelled against Mr. Bush's decision to raise taxes to get a budget deal with Democrats and are still battling the White House over domestic policy.
*Conservatives of various stripes are talking about a challenge to Mr. Bush for the 1992 Presidential nomination. Pete duPont, the former Delaware Governor and another candidate for the Republican nomination in 1988, is setting up a political committee that some conservatives hope will serve as a vehicle for another Presidential campaign. Aides to Mr. duPont say these are pipe dreams of frustrated conservatives.
*Mr. Sununu is barely on speaking terms with Mr. Gingrich and, in a seperate feud, has blocked the President from signing fund-raising letters on behalf of the House Republican Campaign Committee so long as Edward J. Rollins, one of the Republican Party's most outspoken political strategists, is in charge. Mr. Rollins's offense was to suggest during the midterm campaigns that Republican candidates should separate themselves from Mr. Bush's flip-flops on taxes.
The grumbling on the right has become so loud that one Republican entrepreneur has even carved out a successful market by selling buttons with the message, "Dan Quayle now."
So far, most of this is of fascination to a few thousand political insiders. But Republican operatives fear that the confusion is beginning to plant doubts in the public mind about the competence of the President. That would be nothing more than an irritant if the economy, that great mover of public opinion, were headed up. But it is the last thing Mr. Bush needs as the economy heads down, dragging the President's political standing with it.
 
An Old Argument in New Light
 Mr. Bush took a list of potential party chairmen to Camp David this weekend. But some Republicans say that what may be more important is who he names to run his re-election campaign. That is the person who will probably emerge as chief political adviser and will provide the counterweight to Mr. Sununu that has been missing since Mr. Atwater became ill.
Some of what is going on is a battle for control of the domestic policy agenda. "We are in the middle of an argument which a lot of us thought ended in 1989," Mr. Gingrich said. "There really is a fundemental difference between the managerial/accommodationist approach to the welfare state and the reform/replacement approach."
Ideological conservatives like Mr. Gingrich would like the White House to champion a program of low taxes, curtailed bureaucracy, freer markets and the use of Federal funds to increase individual choices in areas like education.
A White House conservative, Jim Pinkerton, called this program "the new paradigm" for a post-New Deal conservative agenda. That led to an inside battle when the budget director, Richard G. Darman, seemed to make fun of the idea in a recent speech. Mr. Gingrich, a proponent of Mr. Pinkerton's thesis, said Mr. Darman should be dismissed if he did not embrace the effort to forge a new conservative agenda.
Mr. Darman and Mr. Gingrich have held about 12 hours of meetings since their blow-up, Mr. Gingrich's staff reports. The mood between the two men is said to be better now, and Mr. Gingrich's camp at least credits Mr. Darman with showing enough respect for the new paradigmists to debate their ideas.
But the big test, the conservatives say, will be what Mr. Bush says in his budget and State of the Union Message about domestic policy. Mr. Sununu tried to address some of that in a speech this week, saying that whether it was called the new paradigm or something else the cornerstone of Mr. Bush's domestic policy was the encouragement of capitalism and the expansion of free markets.

HEADLINE: Police Plan Would Help Some Safer Areas More

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
New York City's police expansion plan, created after last summer's heavily reported rash of criminal violence, would send proportionately fewer officers to some of the city's highest-crime precincts than to some of the safest, a computer study shows.
An analysis of the plan by The New York Times found a number of disparities between levels of violent crime and the percentage of additional officers that would be assigned to precincts and borough commands. 
 A top police aide presented with the findings said that violent crime was only one of many criteria used in developing the proposal, which is meant to shift the department's emphasis toward community patrols.
 
All Would Gain
 The plan's prospects withered early yesterday when the State Legislature recessed without acting on it. Worsening fiscal news is likely to make its passage more difficult in 1991 when the Legislature reconvenes. The city's hopes were smothered by a combination of political factors, along with a suspicion on the part of Republican Senators from Queens and Staten Island that it would slight their districts. [Page 30.]
But the analysis shows that the safest borough, Staten Island, would fare best under the plan, and found no overall pattern of significant differences between the four other boroughs.
At issue is not whether any command would suffer losses -- all 75 precincts and borough offices would be augmented under the plan -- but which would gain most and least.
One Staten Island precinct, the 123d, which already enjoys the city's best police coverage for violent crime -- about 85 officers for every 100 reported violent crimes -- would move to an even higher ratio, the Times study found.
At the same time, the Brooklyn North command, with some of the city's highest-crime precincts, would wind up with the lowest percentage increase of officers. Five northern Brooklyn precincts that now have less than six police officers for every 100 reported violent crimes would find their officer-to-violent-crime ratio improving by only two or three.
In descending order, the largest increases would go to Staten Island, the Manhattan North police command, Brooklyn South, Manhattan South, the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn North.
The question of how the Police Department deploys its resources has long been a thorny one, carrying sweeping social, political and economic consequences. With a finite staff, adding patrols in one community has meant subtracting them from another, although the possibility of a record expansion now poses a different question -- how to divide a bigger pie.
Police officials say that measuring coverage in terms of violent crime alone does not fairly reflect the scope of the plan, which seeks to address community concerns from burglaries and auto theft to highway dangers, prostitution, panhandling, peddling and other "quality of life" problems.
"This is an attempt to significantly increase the uniform patrol presence throughout the city, not just the quote 'high crime' areas," said First Deputy Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, the department's top aide to Commissioner Lee P. Brown. Mr. Kelly led the group of department officials that drew up the plan in weeks of frenzied analysis and round-the-clock meetings.
Mr. Kelly said that Commissioner Brown's concept of community policing involves "a lot more than focusing in on crime, or even violent crime."
"It is recapturing the streets," he said. "It is having community patrol officers marshaling community support. It's job stabilization, keeping business in the city. It's not just, 'Oh, let's respond to the robbery.' "
He said the deployments were drawn up through traditional deployment formulas, not favoritism, and that politicians or community leaders had not been consulted in advance.
 
'Not Etched in Stone'
 Still, he said, "This is a plan and if the assumptions are wrong, you change it. This is not etched in stone."
Hubert Williams, a former police chief of Newark and president of the Police Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit research group, said that while an analysis of manning by violent crime was useful and could be revealing, deployment had to be based on broader considerations.
"If you put your manpower only on violent crime, you'd end up putting your resources exclusively into the minority communities," he said, after being told of the findings. For equal protection under the law, he said, a more balanced use of forces is needed.
The finding that the police expansion plan does not funnel extra officers proportionately into precincts highest in violent crime is striking if only because the plan was so often described by Mayor David N. Dinkins and police officials as a response to the summer's wave of shocking crimes.
Victims included sleeping children killed by stray bullets, a child slain over a moped, a Bronx prosecutor cut down in a drive-by shooting, a Utah tourist fatally stabbed while trying to defend his mother from robbers in the subway and an advertising executive shot to death in a phone booth.
When Mayor Dinkins arranged last August to have a first contingent of 1,058 extra officers added to the ranks, a mayoral spokesman, Lee Jones, said the largest group would go to the highest-crime precincts. Later comments by the Mayor presented the expansion plan as an attack on street violence.
Mayor Dinkins's original $1.8 billion, four-year plan, including court, educational and youth programs totaling $644 million a year, was to have been financed by a property-tax increase, a payroll tax and a lottery surcharge.
In the face of opposition from suburban legislators and City Council members, Mayor Dinkins and the Council last week proposed the slightly scaled-down package. The revised plan, to put 9,744 more officers on the streets, at a cost of $450 million a year, would be financed by a property-tax increase, extension of the city income-tax surcharge and a new city lottery game -- all of which need legislative approval.
But the Senators, including John Marchi of Staten Island, said that they thought that high-crime areas would drain officers from their districts, and demanded that precinct-by-precinct deployments be written into law.
A report by the chairman of the State Senate Standing Committee on Cities, Senator Frank Padavan, last year faulted the department for "serious gaps in manning" but suggested few remedies beyond closer attention to problems in each community. Senator Padavan, from Queens Village, was one of those blocking the plan this week.
Police staffing is determined by a patrol allocation plan with four parts: a radio motor patrol staffing model developed in 1973 by the Rand Corporation to calculate the number of cars needed to handle emergency calls; a sustained operational conditions component that takes into account fixed staffing requirements like diplomatic missions, sports arenas, stations and airports; a public safety factor that rates precincts by their crime statistics, and a local police judgment factor, an assessment of crime problems by field commanders.
 
A Record Force
 "We've been around here a long time and know the busier precincts," said Deputy Commissioner Kelly, a 27-year department veteran.
The initial anti-crime plan, unveiled by Mayor Dinkins and Commissioner Brown on Oct. 2, called for hiring 4,106 additional city police, transit police and housing police officers, above 3,825 additional officers already budgeted, to create a record total force of 38,994 by 1992, compared with 27,024 today.
With some consolidation and the hiring of 3,584 additional civilians to take over former police functions, the department expected to expand its daily patrol strength by 54 percent, from 6,640 to 10,227 officers.
Under the compromise plan, 683 fewer officers would be deployed, generally 6 to 10 fewer per precinct.
The Times used a computer to rank the increases in officers in the new plan by precinct and borough command. The analysis found that the number of officers would grow by almost 40 percent and civilians by 30 percent.
Every precinct was allocated three extra civilians, a reflection of the limited functions that non-uniformed personnel can assume, Deputy Commissioner Kelly said.
The allocation of uniformed staff varied widely among precincts. Topping the list was the 122d Precinct in Staten Island down for a 79 percent increase in officers. The 122d would grow from 144 to 258 officers.
The plan envisioned an expanded role for the seven borough task forces, one each in Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island and two each in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The units were to be used as pools to fill gaps in the precincts with each command.
The Staten Island task force drew the largest expansion, 350 percent, from 20 to 90 officers. The Bronx task force followed with a 134 percent increase, from 99 to 232 officers.
From statistics reported annually by the department, The Times then calculated the average level of four violent crimes -- homicide, rape, robbery and felonious assault -- in each precinct for 1988 and 1989 and compared them to the numbers of officers currently assigned and proposed.
Citywide, there were currently just over nine officers for every 100 violent crimes reported. The plan would lift the figure to 14 officers.
But precincts varied widely in their ratios of violent crimes to the number of officers now and proposed.
After Staten Island's 123d Precinct, with its present ratio of 85 officers for every 100 violent crimes, scheduled to go up to 131, came Manhattan's Central Park Precinct, with nearly 42 officers for each 100 violent crimes, scheduled to rise to about 56. The officer-to-crime ratio of the 111th Precinct in eastern Queens, 32, is scheduled to rise to 48; another Staten Island precinct, the 122d, would see its ratio of 30 officers go up to 54.
At the bottom of the list were a band of precincts in northern Brooklyn, the 73d, 75th, 77th, 79th and 83d, which each now have less than six officers for every 100 violent crimes reported. Under the plan their ratios would go up only to between seven and nine.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Declines 1.7% In Latest Indicator of Recession

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
In a report that hinted of a recession more severe than has been widely assumed, Government figures released today showed the output of the nation's industries tumbled 1.7 percent in November the third straight monthly decline and the biggest in nearly eight years.
Figures also came out today showing that the prices of goods at the final stage of processing climbed five-tenths of 1 percent last month. The rise was more than had been expected, but still represented a slowdown in inflation after three straight months of huge increases driven by oil. 
 But prices at the intermediate stage of production, like flour used to make bread, edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent, and the price of crude goods, like wheat, plunged a record 6.2 percent.
 
A Picture of a Slump
 Those figures and the production numbers together portrayed a slumping economy that would probably keep inflation suppressed in coming months, many analysts said.
The drop in industrial production, which was also worse than generally expected, "is an indication of serious recession in the manufacturing sector," said Alan C. Lerner, an economist at the Bankers Trust Company. "It's in terrible shape" across the whole spectrum of industries, he added.
Michael P. Daly, an economist for the Cigna Corporation, a large insurance company, estimated after seeing today's numbers that the gross national product would drop in the current quarter at a rate of 4 percent. The G.N.P. includes industrial output along with services and production from sources other than factories, mines and utilities.
In the credit markets, prices of debt securities retreated today and interest rates rose, which some analysts attributed to the fact that the increase in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods exceeded expectations. Others suggested, however, that more important factors were skittishness about the Persian Gulf crisis and profit taking after a big run-up in the bond market.
 Those who cited the price data generally contended that with the index rising by amounts higher than would normally be associated with recession, the Federal Reserve would be less likely to decide to take further steps to relax monetary policy at its strategy meeting early next week.
Mr. Lerner and others, however, called inflation statistics a "lagging" indicator and contended that the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee would conclude that prices were under control and would allow a new round of interest-rate cuts to try to bolster the economy. Many analysts expect further cuts in the banking system's overnight lending rate and probably a cut in the discount rate, which is set by the six members of the Federal Reserve Board.
The discount rate is what the Federal Reserve charges financial institutions for loans, and it has been at 7 percent for almost two years. A reduction in the discount rate would be the strongest signal yet, many analysts say, that the central bank is convinced the economy needs the stimulus of lower rates.
 
Industrial Production
 Today's industrial output figures, and related data on capacity utilization that accompanied them, were almost uniformly bleak. The only significant mitigating factor, some analysts said, was that a huge 3.6 percent drop in production by the nation's utilities was largely a result of unseasonably warm weather.
Manufacturing fell 1.7 percent, the same as the overall index, with durable goods down 2.5 percent and nondurables down six-tenths of 1 percent. Mining fell one-tenth of 1 percent, the report showed.
A 20 percent drop in motor-vehicle assembly, combined with a sharp reduction in related parts and materials, represented more than half the overall 1.7 percent November drop in total industrial output.
The report also showed that consumer goods fell 2 percent, business equipment fell 1.9 percent and construction supplies fell 1.7 percent.
The output figures for both September and October were also revised downward today. . Output for September, initially estimated as having risen two-tenths of 1 percent, was revised to a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent. October's decline was put at nine-tenths of 1 percent, rather than eight-tenths.
The overall November drop was the biggest since a 2 percent slide in December 1982 at the end of the most recent recession.
At 107.5 percent of its 1987 average, output last month was six-tenths of 1 percent below its level of November 1989.
Capacity utilitization fell 1.5 percentage points, to 80.9 percent, last month, its lowest level since May 1987. The utilization rate for manufacturing fell to 80 percent from 81.6 percent, the lowest level since January 1987.
 
Producer Prices
 Among some analysts the rise in the November Producer Price Index was dismissed as an aberration even though the index rose the same amount -- five-tenths of 1 percent -- with or without the energy and food components, which often show wide swings.
"I don't think the number can continue at that rate," said Mr. Daly, the Cigna economist.
Other analysts who contend that prices will not keep rising noted that although the price of passenger cars rose modestly last month that trend seemed unlikely to be maintained in the face of slumping sales. They also said that while prices of tobacco products soared 3.7 percent, that was probably a one-time jump in anticipation of late-year buying by those hoping to beat the tax increases that take effect on Jan. 1. The Federal tax is going up 4 cents a pack, to 20 cents.
 
Food Costs Rise
 The rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods last month followed three straight increases exceeding 1 percent. Food, not energy, was the major factor last month, with an increase of eight-tenths of 1 percent that reflected higher prices for fresh and dried vegetables, fish, pork, beef, veal and confectionery and bakery products. The biggest declines were in dairy products, processed fruits and vegetables, eggs, shortening and cooking oils.
Finished energy goods rose only one-tenth of 1 percent, with declines for gasoline and home heating oil of 2.6 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively. Analysts said that during the month there had been a lessening of the "war premium" built into oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. There was, however, a 5 percent jump in the price of natural gas.
Prices rose more rapidly than in October for pharmaceuticals and tires and tubes, and prices turned up for household textile goods and floor coverings.
Among intermediate goods, domestic producers received slightly lower prices for energy after three months of rapid increases; the price of foods, feeds and construction materials turned down after sharp October increases.
 
Some Prices Are Down
 Consistent with the drop in industrial output, the price of durables used in manufacturing dropped 1 percent, after showing no change in October. Primary nonferrous metals tumbled 7.5 percent, aluminum mill shapes fell 1.7 percent and prices also fell for cold rolled steel sheet and strip. Prices dropped faster, 5.5 percent, than in October for copper and brass mill shapes, and for hardwood lumber prices were down five-tenths of 1 percent, the Labor Department report showed.
Nondurables used in manufacturing, however, rose an average 1 percent, after a 1.3 percent October advance. Plastic resins, chemicals, paint, paperboard, nitrogenates and synthetic rubber all rose, while prices fell for wood pulp and finished fabrics.
The record 6.2 percent plunge in the price of crude goods was paced by a 10.3 percent decline in crude energy, including a 16.1 percent drop in petroleum. Foods and feeds fell 1.7 percent, aided by lower prices for hogs and soybeans. Crude materials other than food and energy fell 2.3 percent.
With food and energy excluded, intermediate goods rose two-tenths of 1 percent, half as much as in October, while finished goods rose five-tenths of 1 percent, after no change the month before.
Finished goods now stand 7 percent higher than in November 1989.
Producer prices tend to foreshadow those at the consumer level but the correlation is relatively loose. Unlike the Consumer Price Index, which is to be reported next Tuesday for November, the producer index does not include imported goods or directly measured services.
 
Inventories
 In yet another report, this one covering October, the Commerce Department found that business inventories rose modestly, to $813.9 billion, or 2.5 percent above the level of October 1989. Stocks of durables were up 1.4 percent, while stocks of nondurables were 4.3 percent higher.
Business sales also rose, reaching $551.8 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The inventory-sales ratio at the end of the month was 1.47, down from 1.48 in September and 1.51 in October 1989. The ratio means that at current sales rates, it would take 1.47 months, or about 44 days, to deplete current inventories. The ratio has gone as high as 1.74, in January 1982.

RACE AND CLASS IN TEXAS POLITICS
By Chandleravidson.
Illustrated. 344 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
Princeton University Press. $24.95. 
 WITHOUT any real warning, 221 pages into his book, Chandler Davidson suddenly brings his reader face to face with the dark soul of American politics. We have already examined copious charts and endless footnotes on the subject of "Race and Class in Texas Politics" when he introduces two men he calls Bob and Al, whom he overheard arguing politics while lounging in a Houston swimming pool in 1985.
Bob is a union electrican, out of work. He is falling behind in the rent and can't make his child support payments. "That son-of-a-bitch Reagan put me out of a job," Bob mutters. Al, his friend, stiffens. "You're talking about my man."
Bob blows past the objection. He spits out statistics about 200,000 lost union jobs in Texas. "The bastard's a union buster."
Al tries to calm him with promises of better times to come. But when that fails he shifts his argument: "You've got it wrong. . . . It's the goddamn niggers, who'll work for lower wages. And it's these goddamn wetbacks. That's who's taken your job. You can't blame that on Reagan."
"Now you're talking sense," Bob finally says, after remaining silent for a long time. "Now you're talking something that I can relate to. You've put your finger on something now."
Mr. Davidson, a sociologist at Rice University who tends to write in the academic past tense, was paying attention. For all his other research, and it is considerable, nothing sums up his story -- the failure of Texas politics to move in the progressive direction he would like -- better than this moment. It is the story of a state that, he argues, has a liberal impulse stronger than most outsiders realize, but an impulse that remains frustrated by the abiding schism of race.
"Because the racial issue and the complex social questions connected with it -- poverty, crime, drugs, and abortion, among others -- had not subsided and, indeed, showed little sign of doing so," Mr. Davidson writes, "the possibility of an ascendant liberal-moderate coalition seemed remote."
The elements are here of a more important book than Mr. Davidson has actually written. The struggle over race in America has clearly entered a new and troubling phase. This problem of Texas politics -- liberal intent curbed by racial voting -- has become the problem of national politics. As Mr. Davidson correctly points out, the politics of the United States is the politics of each of the 50 states, and Texas, to stress the obvious, is one of the biggest: "In area, it ranked second in 1980; in population, third; in aggregate personal income, third."
Mr. Davidson's purpose is to revisit the findings of V. O. Key Jr., the political scientist whose post-World War II book "Southern Politics in State and Nation" was a seminal piece of American political theory and analysis. Key, a Texan, demonstrated how the issues of race and class were intertwined, and how wealthy Southerners had used race to convince the white working class that their interests as whites bound them to the upper classes more than their interests as workers separated them.
It was Key's vision that in the new South the one-party system would break down. Then, he believed, progressives would take control of the Democratic Party as the wealthy found their new home in the resurgent Republican Party. Clear ideological distinctions, blurred in the old one-party South, would be drawn; white workers would follow their class interests by remaining Democrats but abandon their racial allegiance to the white aristocracy.
V. O. Key got all but the last part right, Mr. Davidson concludes. The South in general, and Texas in particular, have a vibrant two-party system that cuts across class lines; however, more whites than Key predicted have moved to the Republican Party. Liberals are ascendant in the Democratic Party -- after Mr. Davidson's book was completed, they even managed to elect Ann Richards as Governor of Texas (although they had a good bit of help from a Republican candidate, Clayton Williams, whose only real appeal as a candidate was his willingness to put up millions of his own money for the campaign).
But Mr. Davidson's pessimism runs deeper than any one election. Unfortunately, he brings us to the heart of the matter but then, literally on his last page, leaves us there. In academic tones, he concludes: "How could the exorcism of racial issues from Texas politics be achieved when racial antagonisms were still tightly woven into the fabric of everyday life? How could one ignore race when every step forward by racial minorities was resisted by numerous whites who perceived this progress as being at their expense? How could a moratorium be declared on the subject when one of the two major political parties saw an advantage in keeping it before the public, fanning the embers of old racial hostilities? These were questions to which there were no good answers."
PERHAPS not. But there are other questions, too. Why was Bob's anger, as overheard by Mr. Davidson, so easily redirected from class to race? Shouldn't those who view themselves as progressives be trying to explain to him the value and correctness of current civil rights efforts? Can they? If not, why not? To what extent are middle-class whites protecting class or economic interests by voting with the Republican Party?
Is it even really correct to talk about "old racial hostilities"? Or has the hostility tramsmogrified into something fundamentally new? President Bush, by vetoing the Civil Rights Act of 1990 and injecting pejorative rhetoric about "quotas" into the midterm Congressional election, may well have helped Jesse Helms, a symbol of old hostilities, save his United States Senate seat in North Carolina. But painting the Democratic candidate, Dianne Feinstein, as a supporter of racial quotas was also a powerful help to Senator Pete Wilson on his way to winning the race for Governor of California, where new hostilities -- toward Asian and Hispanic immigrants -- matter more than old ones.
Millions of white Americans, and not just in Texas, join Bob and Al in their sense that racial minorities are taking unfair advantage, and that the Government is helping them do it. Confronting that view would be more productive than just bemoaning it if Texas, and the nation, hope to find the "way out" for which V. O. Key was searching 41 years ago.

THE HUMAN MOTOR
Energy, Fatigue, and the Origins of Modernity.
By Anson Rabinbach.
Illustrated. 402 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $34.95. 
 In 1904, the German physiologist Wilhelm Weichardt announced that he had discovered a vaccine against fatigue. Weichardt's experiments with the blood chemistry of fatigued rats had convinced him that exhaustion was the product of a specific toxin. In his laboratory he had created an immunizing antitoxin and injected small amounts in human subjects -- with, he claimed, remarkable results. Over the next 10 years, scientists sprayed Weichardt's vaccine in school classrooms, pumped it as a gas into laboratories and injected it into soldiers. By 1914, most physiologists had concluded that Weichardt's claims were exaggerated. But the search for so-called "nerve whips" to combat fatigue (the most promising candidates were tea, coffee and cocaine) continued.
The peculiar combination of scientific method and utopian yearning in the story of Weichardt's fatigue vaccine is the subject of Anson Rabinbach's important new book. "The Human Motor" is a history of a scientific and technological metaphor. It describes how the conceptual revolution of 19th-century physics -- specifically, the discovery of the laws of thermodynamics -- gave birth to the idea of the working body as a particular kind of machine. Mr. Rabinbach, an associate professor of history at Cooper Union in New York, tells how efforts by European scientists to harness the human motor transformed the modern understanding of work and society, and of modernity itself. It is also the story of the rise and fall of a particular scientific utopia, the vision of a society without fatigue.
Mr. Rabinbach is no great stylist. His text is at times repetitious and rambling. Still, his book is a fine example of what might be called the new cultural history of science. Tracing in great detail how one metaphor from science and technology has shaped contemporary political and social thought, "The Human Motor" is an intriguing study of "how science organizes, represents, and structures its knowledge along sometimes unconscious fault lines, often with unintended political and social consequences."
According to Mr. Rabinbach, 19th-century Europe inherited a fundamentally moral conception of work. The legacy of medieval Christianity, this view led people to understand work in terms of personal attributes or failings. The social disruptions of the Industrial Revolution -- for example, conflicts over the work disciplines of the new factory system -- were at first seen entirely in terms of this moral framework, as a battle between "industry" and "idleness."
But in midcentury, this moral discourse about work began to change under the impact of ideas from physics. In 1847, the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz articulated the universal law of the conservation of energy. Helmholtz conceived of all the forces of nature as but the myriad forms of a single, universal energy, what he called "the groundwork of all our thoughts and acts."
The idea of a universal energy led to an equally universal concept of work. Helmholtz's term for it was "labor power." Initially a measurement of the force of machines, labor power came to be a measure of the conversion of energy into use -- whether by nature, technology or the human body. According to this theory, the body was quite literally a motor -- a machine for transforming energy into work -- no different from a waterfall or a steam engine. And the only criterion for distinguishing the work of the human motor from that of any other was "the utility and efficiency of the energy transferred." Work was shorn of social purpose, abstracted from the specific context of particular occupations, social relationships or human goals.
Helmholtz's idea of nature as a vast storehouse of energy available for productive work spoke to the optimism of 19th-century bourgeois society. The theory that human society and nature were fundamentally linked by the primacy and identity of all productive activity -- a world view that Mr. Rabinbach labels "productivism" -- encouraged the conviction that a scientific approach to work could liberate the productive potential of the human body.
Mr. Rabinbach persuasively argues that productivism decisively shaped 19th-century social thought across the ideological spectrum. In his early works of the 1840's, for example, Karl Marx had considered work an essentially human activity that defined social identity. By the early 1860's and the writing of "Capital," Marx had so thoroughly assimilated Helmholtz's idea of labor power that his view had changed completely. No longer the paradigm of human activity, work was a burden from which humanity would be emancipated through technology and what Marx called scientific social organization.
But there was another, more pessimistic strand to the new scientific understanding of work. Not long after Helmholtz set out his theory of energy conservation, Rudolf Clausius demonstrated that in practical terms the transformation of energy into work was accompanied by an inevitable dissipation of force -- an idea that led to the second law of thermodynamics, which explains the irreversibility and decline of energy in entropy. Thus, parallel to the enormous promise of productivism was the fear -- Mr. Rabinbach calls it an "anxiety of limits" -- that the demands of industrial work and of modernity itself would exhaust the body. "Fatigue became the objective nemesis of a society founded on labor power," Mr. Rabinbach writes. Work ceased to be a matter of individual moral character to become a problem of social hygiene.
The major focus of Mr. Rabinbach's book is the search by European physiologists, psychologists and physicians to create a "thermodynamics of society" that would allow European civilization to transcend the problem of fatigue and realize industrial society's productive potential. Before 1870 there were hardly any scientific studies of fatigue; by 1890 there was an extensive literature on the physiological and psychological aspects of the problem. And by 1900 laboratories devoted to the experimental science of the "human motor" were established in almost all countries on the Continent.
European work scientists strove to identify the laws of fatigue and use them for social improvement. Physiologists devised instruments to measure fatigue and studied the physiology of the human muscles and the role of nutrition in the thermodynamics of the body. Psychologists searched for the causes of mental diseases such as neurasthenia in the underlying physiological dynamics of fatigue.
Arguing that a more scientific approach to fatigue would result not only in social justice for the worker but greater productivity for society as a whole, work scientists also took an active role in the debates over work reform. They lobbied for a shorter workday and for the adoption of social insurance to compensate workers suffering industrial accidents. The result was a characteristically modern political ideology that celebrated science as the solution to social problems, in particular the endemic economic and political conflicts pitting capital against labor in industrial Europe.
But, according to Mr. Rabinbach, "the greatest weakness of the science of work lay in its most compelling assumption" -- that scientific objectivity alone could resolve the worker question. With few exceptions, European work scientists were more comfortable in the laboratory than in the factory. This proved a singular disadvantage when they were confronted with a new American import -- Frederick Winslow Taylor's system of scientific management.
Like the European work scientists, Taylor promised a neutral, "scientific" method to solve the problems of workplace conflict. But his was a movement of engineers and managers with far more direct experience of the shop floor than the physiologists and psychologists in their experimental labs. Even more important, Taylor took worker dissatisfaction as a given -- to be countered by the higher wages made possible by increased productivity, but never entirely eliminated. When Taylor's method was first introduced in Europe in the years before World War I, it was immediately embraced by industrialists, as well as by many trade unionists. The ideas of the European work scientists did eventually come to be incorporated into management practice, but only as techniques for "humanizing" scientific management, not as a full-fledged program for social reform.
Mr. Rabinbach argues that as work has come to depend less and less on physical effort, the idea of the human motor has lost its compelling power. With its disappearance, work has ceased to be a central issue in modern social thought. But here Mr. Rabinbach's relentless focus on the human-motor metaphor may lead him to miss the deeper phenomenon of which it is an expression.
Today, new technologies and new competitive realities are transforming work much as did the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. As people cope with the unique demands of knowledge work, their worries have come to center not on physical fatigue but on psychological stress. Similarly, both researchers and managers have fastened on a new technological metaphor: not the body as a kind of motor but the mind as a kind of program or expert system. But while the terminology is different, the basic impulse remains the same. The modern tendency to seek in science and technology the antidote to our "anxiety of limits" lives on.

HEADLINE: Birth Control Backlash

BYLINE: By Philip J. Hilts; Philip J. Hilts is a science and health reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
IN THE 30 YEARS SINCE THE CONTRACEPTIVE pill was introduced in the United States, this country has fallen farther and farther behind Europe in the birth-control choices available. Until 1980, at least nine large pharmaceutical companies were carrying on significant research into contraceptive development. Now there is only one, the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, which makes a variety of birth-control devices.
This month the F.D.A. is expected to approve what would be the first substantially new contraceptive brought out in the United States in 25 years. Known as Norplant, it is a long-term hormonal device that would be implanted under a woman's skin. Norplant was developed by a small nonprofit group concerned with population problems and issues, the New York-based Population Council. Perhaps more remarkable than the promise of Norplant as a socially useful drug is that no American pharmaceutical company seemed willing to research and develop it. The Population Council spent 24 years, on and off, raising money and doing research in its own labs, before it finally brought Norplant to the Government for approval. 
 Dr. C. Wayne Bardin, a soft-spoken Texan, is the director of the Population Council's Center for Biomedical Research. One afternoon a few months ago, he gave a visitor a preview demonstration. Dozens of soft surgical-rubber tubes, each about the size of a match, nestled in a small cardboard box he had placed on the black marble table in the center of his office. He picked out six of the tubes and arranged them on the table, as if he were spreading a deck of cards, in a nearly complete circle.
"They would go under the skin like this, in a sort of fan, on the inside of the upper arm," he said. "You can feel them under there, but you can't see them usually." The tubes are slightly porous, and once in place dispense the hormone, a type of progestin, at a low, steady rate into the body, for up to five years, after which they may be replaced by a new set.
Norplant is likely to be, with the exception of sterilization, the most effective contraceptive ever introduced. More effective than the pill, because its effectiveness is not dependent on someone remembering to take it, it should also have fewer side effects, because it delivers a low, steady dose of a single hormone. According to Bardin, it will cost about $200 to $300 for the five-year dose. The initial cost is high but much less than the cost of using the pill over the same period.
Norplant's history reflects the surprising state of contraception in the United States. It is widely known that the so-called abortion pill, RU-486, has been kept by its manufacturer, Roussel, from all countries except France for fear of the political and economic consequences, although the company is now considering England as another market. But what is perhaps less known is that RU-486 is only one of many contraceptives held off the American market for political or business reasons.

CURIOUSLY, IT WAS an unwitting coalition of longtime adversaries -- manufacturing companies and courtroom litigators; feminists, right-to-life groups and religious activists, including the Catholic Church -- who over the last two decades, working independently, created what is now described as the birth-control backlash.
Three decades after the introduction of the pill, the most popular way of preventing pregnancy among American women and men is sterilization. Among those who use some form of contraception, this most extreme and largely irreversible approach is the choice of 28 percent of the women and 12 percent of the men. The next most popular methods are the oral contraceptive, used by 31 percent, and the condom, used by 15 percent.
In the 1980's, all four American manufacturers of the intrauterine device, the most effective method of birth control after the pill, pulled their products off the market when one, the Dalkon Shield, was found to cause serious and sometimes fatal infections. Political opposition has prevented the use of injectable contraceptives, like Depo-Provera, which is commonly used in other countries.
Abortion serves as the method of birth control for 1.6 million women annually in the nation. At least half turn to abortion after their chosen method of contraception has failed.
Earlier this year, official recognition of the dire situation came in the form of a report by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. Millions of unwanted pregnancies, abortions and sterilizations have occurred in the nation, the report said, because the contraceptive methods available have failed to meet the need.
Dr. Luigi Mastroianni, chairman of the academy's study group and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, presented the report at a news conference: "While we in the United States make do with the same range of options available 30 years ago, in some European countries people can choose among contraceptive implants, injectable contraceptives, and a variety of pills, IUD's and sterilization techniques not available here."
Moreover, Mastroianni added, "many European countries are years ahead of the United States in the development of further contraceptive advances." And they are likely to remain so. "The outlook for new contraceptive development is bleak," he said.
Carl Djerassi, a Stanford University chemist who was one of the creators of the pill, agrees with Mastroianni's assessment. "The United States is the only country other than Iran in which the birth-control clock has been set backward during the past decade," he wrote in Science magazine. While some 50 nations have improved their record on birth control and population, he estimates, resolve in this country has flickered.
It is perhaps a sign of the tumbling order of things that Djerassi himself published an article recently in which he advocated a "jet age rhythm method," conjuring an image of the father of the pill turning from his child. "The present crisis in contraceptive R.&D. through the virtual withdrawal of large pharmaceutical companies," he wrote in Science, ". . . suggests we take another look at one of the least efficacious methods, natural family planning." He suggested that chemists develop litmus-type tests to predict and confirm ovulation.
Thus, as Bardin sits with Norplant fanned out on the table before him, he shows some commingled feelings. Strains of chagrin darken the pleasure of the moment. "This is not the best way to develop a contraceptive," he says. "But it appears that for now, this is the way we will have to do it. The system has broken down."
There are 10 other contraceptive products on Bardin's list, including a vaginal ring that dispenses hormones, two male implants that will suppress sperm production but keep libido up, a hormone-releasing intrauterine device, a simple doctor's-office method of male sterilization. They also may have to be brought to market by this unorthodox new route.
Developing contraceptives this way, he says, "is good only if you are opposed to contraception. This way of doing things will certainly keep contraceptives off the market. Listen, we are only a teeny, tiny operation, and we have to spend a huge amount of time fund raising. It takes us a very long time to bring a contraceptive to market." If Norplant succeeds, a small percentage of the profits will be given to the Population Council to finance further research, the rest will go to the distributor, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.

MANY EVENTS IN business, politics and law led to the current situation. But perhaps equally influential have been American attitudes toward sex and unwanted pregnancy.
"We are fooling ourselves if we think a technological fix is going to get us out of our dilemma of high rates of pregnancy and abortion," says Dr. Jacqueline Darroch Forrest, the chief of research for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research and education organization. On a rainy, chilly afternoon in early summer, Forrest sat in her small Manhattan office, surrounded by stacks of journals and books. A spider plant hanging from the ceiling dropped its tentacles onto the tall stacks.
In 1986, Forrest surveyed a group of 760 young American women in low-income groups. Her survey showed that the women on average were afraid of the pill and the intrauterine device because they feared health problems. At the same time, they did not want to use barrier methods, like the condom and diaphragm, because dealing with the issue of birth control with their partners was awkward. Anyway, the women said, those methods were ineffective enough to leave them fearing pregnancy.
Their shyness about dealing with their boyfriends on the issue of birth control is striking. In America, sex is used routinely to sell products and to entertain. But people avoid talking about it when it comes to health. In "sex education" classes around the nation, AIDS is a required topic, Forrest points out, but the details of what constitutes safe sex are often not discussed. "You can tell them about all the bugs they can get and not talk about sex. You can tell them not to become pregnant but not tell them what the negotiating skills are with partners so you can use a condom."
In the mid-1980's, the Guttmacher Institute carried out a case study comparing contraceptive use and outcomes among teen-agers in five European countries and in the United States. When European parents were asked about issues of sexuality, they said their chief worry was to prevent unwanted pregnancies. "I don't think parents there are comfortable about the issues, or about their children having sex," Forrest said, "but I think they're more focussed on trying to avoid harm coming to them that way."
Parents in the United States, however, said their greatest concern was that their teen-agers were having sex. "They focused on the sex rather than the consequences," she said.
The issue was moral, with a result that for teen-agers it came to seem acceptable to have sex only without planning. "It is not so much the spontaneous sex that seems sinful to the young women, but the premeditation," Forrest said.
Ultimately, it is an attitude that affects many women of childbearing age. American men and women have one of the worst records in the industrialized world when it comes to the use of contraception. The physical cost is abortion or pregnancy, either of which is more dangerous in terms of health risks than any contraceptive method.
Forrest's studies have shown, for the first time, just how high the rate of unintended pregnancy is in the United States compared with Europe. Young women in America have double the number of unplanned pregnancies. "It was surprising that we were so different," Forrest commented. "It's not that we were having so much teen-age sex -- that was happening there too -- but here teen-agers are much less likely to use contraceptives." Among those between 15 and 19 years old, the study found, the rate of pregnancy in this country was 95.2 per 1,000 women, compared with 39 in Canada, 46 in England and Wales, 29 in Sweden and 13 in the Netherlands. A similarly high rate existed among women 20 to 24 years old.
The rate of abortions among teen-agers in the United States was also high, 43.5 per 1,000 compared with 14.2 in Canada.
"I just don't understand -- if we don't want to have 1.6 million abortions every year -- why we aren't focusing more efforts to avoid unintentional pregnancy," Forrest said.
In the 16 years she has been tracking the numbers, the carnage from unwanted pregnancy and abortion has continued largely without change. "I think there is a punishment motive there, as well," Forrest said. "Why should we invest in things for these women to do what we don't want them to do?"
She leaned over her desk, resting her cheek on her hand. "I am discouraged. In the era of 'Just say no' and AIDS, people were expecting a return to chastity. But the data say it didn't happen." Between 1982 and 1988, the rate of teen-age girls who had ever had sex rose to 53 percent from what was considered extremely high at 47 percent.
It was chilly in the office, and she pulled her turquoise jacket a little more tightly around her. "I wonder whether we as a country care about this or not?"

THE BIRTH-CONTROL PILL and its medical and political side effects were also a major factor contributing to the current situation.
The pill was relatively cheap, and it could be used without the permission or even the knowledge of men. Thus sexual acts were uncoupled from the biological momentum toward birth; reproductive choice was finally in the hands of women. But the 1960's and 70's were a time of anger. The pill became politicized. The backlash came not only from the right, as might have been expected, but from other quarters as well. It was a multiple collision of forces.
Feminists had for years worked to encourage the creation of the pill, but not long after it appeared, a new generation of women was angered by it. A few years ago, a revised version of the popular women's health manual "Our Bodies, Ourselves," written by the Boston Women's Health Book Collective, recalled the early days of the pill: "The Food and Drug Administration approved the pill for marketing in 1960 without adequate testing or study. A synthetic pill almost 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy when taken daily, it created tremendous excitement among the medical, scientific, pharmaceutical and population-control communities. . . . The pill became a gigantic experiment: within two years about 1.2 million American women used it."
In fact, the medical side effects of the pill were always very rare, but they came as a shock. Dr. Gabriel Bialy, head of the contraceptive research program at the Federal Government's National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, says the feminist attitude was naive: "There's no such thing as a free ride. Every drug has certain side effects. People should have expected this, but they didn't."
The first pill to come on the market was far stronger than it needed to be: it "represented an overdosage," Bialy says. "The companies didn't understand the effects of the hormones, and needed a product that would be unquestionably effective. So they guessed too high. Companies did recognize the side effects within three or four years and cut back on the dose. But the next thing you know it was a male conspiracy, and the pill was bringing death to women. Generally when people pick up a cause, objectivity is not the prime requirement."
Detecting the side effects before the pill came to market would have required clinical tests on hundreds of thousands of women. But even after the side effects became apparent, doctors continued to prescribe it. Barbara Seaman, author of the 1969 book "The Doctor's Case Against the Pill," recalled for National Public Radio in a recent program that many women were unaware of the possible side effects. "Doctors were not telling them. So I just got angrier and angrier about that. I felt it was our bodies . . . what right did they have to give normal healthy women a very powerful medication to take year in and year out, that in one degree or another would kill a few of them and maim more than a few of them?"
Another writer, Jane O'Reilly, prefers to think of herself and other women as pioneers. "We could either look at ourselves as guinea pigs who were used, or we could look at ourselves as martyrs and heroes of the women's movement," she said recently on the same program. "Because, by trying it . . . we did discover what would be safer. But principally we discovered what it was like to take control of our reproductive lives."
For some, the experience with the pill was the catalyst to organization. By the time Senator Gaylord Nelson held hearings on the safety of the pill in 1970, early pamphlet editions of "Our Bodies, Ourselves" were already being published. The National Women's Health Network was formed in 1975 when Barbara Seaman and Belita Cowan wanted to establish a full-time feminist health lobby in Washington.
The fear of harm to women has remained a theme over the years. Feminists now advocate the use of diaphragms or cervical caps, with abortion as a backup, according to Judy Norsigian, co-director of the Boston Women's Health Book Collective and a board member of the National Women's Health Network. The backup may be necessary because these barrier methods are relatively ineffective.
The National Women's Health Network urges caution with methods that use hormones to stop ovulation, like the pill. In order of preference, the group lists even spermicides and natural birth control (observation of the body's cyclical fluctuations) ahead of the pill in preference. This has put them in the unfortunate position of appearing elitist, by advocating the methods most effectively used by affluent white women like themselves, but which are most unacceptable and startlingly unsuccessful among the disadvantaged. (The pregnancy rate for white women who use the diaphragm as their method of birth control ranges from 10.3 to 22.5 percent. The rate for nonwhite women is 30.3 to 57 percent.)
Another contraceptive plagued by the fear of side effects was Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive that used hormones similar to those in the pill. In 1974, the F.D.A. decided to approve Depo-Provera, made by Upjohn, for use as a contraceptive; it was already being used to treat cancer, and had been on the market in other countries for contraception. But the agency deferred further action after a campaign led by feminists who cited unwanted side effects. For more than two decades, the debate raged.
"Among the companies, the feeling was that if they throw out this one, they could throw out anything," says Richard A. Edgren, director of scientific affairs at Syntex Laboratories, a leading manufacturer of the pill. "It was tainted forever. This said to the companies, that after 100 million dollars of work, women can throw it out, even after the F.D.A. approved it." Finally Upjohn decided not to resubmit its application for approval.
"Upjohn said, 'We'll never do it again,' " Edgren says. "I can't believe how fast and how completely they shut down. They fired people and retrained the rest for other areas."
Then in the 1970's came the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine device made by A. H. Robins Company. In the Gaylord Nelson hearings of 1969 and 1970, it was one product mentioned as an alternative to the pill. In fact, the Dalkon Shield turned out to be far more dangerous.
When serious infections began to be reported in large numbers, company executives hid the facts. Some 320,000 claims were filed against the company, and eventually it was ordered to pay compensatory and punitive damages. In bankruptcy proceedings a year or so later, it was ordered to set aside $2.475 billion to pay the claims.
Now, as Norplant is about to be put on the market, the worries continue. The National Women's Health Network has announced its opposition to its approval and marketing; the group suggested more research was needed.

ULTIMATELY, THE TURMOIL had its effect on the contraceptive business. For the executives who have run the contraceptive divisions of pharmaceutical companies, the matter became one of doing business in what they call "a difficult climate."
The plain-spoken and feisty Roderick L. Mackenzie, chairman of Gynopharma Inc., a small contraceptive manufacturer in New Jersey, which markets one of only two IUD's now sold in the country, complains: "The F.D.A. put major restrictions on development; organized women's groups campaigned against the pill and other methods. This is not a very encouraging atmosphere. After the baby has been thrown out with the bath water, then they say: Hey, why is everybody out of business?"
A major argument put forward by some companies and by the report of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, is that lawsuits against the companies were a key factor in the decline in America's work on birth control. "It is an article of faith," Mackenzie says, "that the litigious climate in the United States has created such a product-liability monster that all of the problems facing women and their contraceptive choices in the United States can be blamed on this truth."
But, he adds, taking a listener by surprise: "Everybody believes this except the senior executives of the prescription-contraceptive businesses. The reason these executives don't believe this is they know the facts. The truth of the matter is that the cost of defense, insurance premiums, settlements and court-mandated judgments has not been overwhelming. It represents a very small cost when measured as a percentage of sales over the past 5, 10 or 20 years."
Edgren, who has worked at Searle, Wyeth and Warner-Lambert as well as at Syntex, said the anger of the 1960's and 1970's was demoralizing. "During that period more and more companies began pulling out. There was litigation that people were starting to worry about, there was bad publicity." But he too is surprisingly frank, as he adds: "But mostly it looked as if the market was saturated -- there were quite a number of companies selling the pill. It looked like new products might not do well financially, so they started pulling out.
"You can keep four or five researchers busy in the area of reproduction, but you could put the same four or five in cardiovascular research and be likely to come out with a more lucrative product. After all, there are about 50 million customers of reproductive age. But there are darn near 100 percent of the whole population as it gets older who will need these other products."
After 45 minutes of explaining some details of the situation to a reporter, MacKenzie paused.
"Look," he said, "you must bear in mind that there were billion-dollar single entities out there, like Tagamet for ulcers. Immunotherapy drugs. Cardiovascular drugs. In those fields you don't have to be 100 percent effective, you can be 70 percent effective. Your side effects don't have to be zero, they can be 20 percent and still not be unacceptable. You don't have a sea of bad publicity endangering your other drugs, and your researchers can get Nobel Prizes."
Companies actually stayed in the field longer than one might have expected, he maintains. Not only dollars and cents were involved. There was some sense of social responsibility. "But over 15 years people got exhausted and got out."
A few small companies have picked up the flag from the fallen majors. Alza, a California pharmaceutical corporation, has for the past few years been selling an IUD. Peter F. Carpenter, a preppy-looking executive who is president of Alza's development branch, is one of those leading the effort to bring new birth-control devices to market.
"My sense of what's happening is that things are getting very polarized, a time when everybody but the fiercest bows out of the argument," he says. "I find it a very ominous development because in a democracy we need to find a common ground. Contraception has become politicized. We as a society do not deal well with controversy, and leave it to those on either end to fight it out.
"The prudent businessman will stay away from controversy because it exposes his entire product line to boycott," he says. "What would happen if we sacrificed earnings for three years to do something interesting? The Wall Street people would say: 'Hey that's nice. I'll get out and come back later.' It is very hard to take the long-term perspective.
"As a consequence," Carpenter says, "here we sit in the most advanced society in the world, and a woman here has fewer contraceptives than any woman in the developed world."
The decision has been taken in business -- and in government. The Federal Government has abandoned its position that slowing population growth in the world is essential. It has withdrawn funds from the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the United Nations' Fund for Population Activities. Congress has failed to reauthorize domestic family-planning legislation for four years, effectively freezing funds for the nation's clinics.
And the embodiment of the Government's concern about birth control, the contraceptive research program at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has been budgeted at about the same level for the past 15 years, despite an inflationary spiral. An era has ended. Having created modern contraception, having convinced the world of the importance of birth control, America has abdicated leadership in the field.

HEADLINE: Heard About the Copy Shop In Budapest?

BYLINE: BY FRED MARTIN; Fred Martin is president of the Bancroft Group, an international business consulting firm in Washington.

 BODY:
At day's end, the exhausted business travelers gather in the bars of Budapest's hotels -- the Forum, the Hyatt, the Gellert -- and trade stories. They are happy warriors, frontiersmen on the edge of an entrepreneurial wilderness, proud of their exploits and bemused by the strangeness of local ways. They love to tell war stories, show their medals from the front. One night it was the Japanese fellow who told of selling turbines to Bulgaria in exchange for eggs. For several months afterward, he couldn't get an omelet in the hotel's dining room.
Then there was the English hotelier who told of flying from Helsinki to Leningrad, standing in the aisle because there were no available seats. We wondered when Aeroflot would install straps. And there was the Kodak man who topped them all. Not long ago, on his first trip to Moscow, he was deciding what to order in a restaurant on Red Square. Looking around, he saw a nearby diner eating chicken, and said to the waiter, "I'll have what he's having." The waiter walked over, picked up the plate of food and gave it to the Kodak man. 
 Most misunderstandings are less dramatic, but there is plenty of room for confusion when Westerners and Eastern Europeans get together to discuss business. This story tells of one attempt to start a small business in downtown Budapest during a year of momentous economic and political change, and of the cultural miscues that ensued.
My firm represents large American manufacturing companies, hotel chains and retailers trying to invest in or start up operations in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania. We also help individuals make investments. One of our clients, Paul Panitz, a businessman in Washington, had the idea of opening a small shop in Hungary, an idea that appealed to me as a challenge: it would mean engaging in precisely the kind of entrepreneurship that Eastern Europe needs to create free markets.
In the 11 months since this collaboration began, my company has helped large corporate clients execute significant deals in Eastern Europe, but nothing has been more difficult or frustrating than starting this shop -- and nothing could have been more instructive in demonstrating how the wheels of commerce turn in Eastern Europe.
Paul Panitz is a 43-year-old who created his own typesetting company and then sold it for a substantial sum three years ago, leaving him free to pursue other projects. Like many people, he was moved by last year's historic events in Eastern Europe and wanted to be part of them. He first approached me in February 1990, asking for advice on how to aid the cause of a free press in Eastern Europe. (Eventually, we made a loan-equity deal with a large daily newspaper over there, lending a fair amount of money in return for a potential stake in the company.) We also discussed setting up a small business in Hungary, not unlike the one Paul had started in America. The venture would throw us into the thick of Eastern European economic change; it would contribute some capital and jobs to Hungary's fledgling free market, and, properly run, it just might turn a profit someday.
I suggested a copy shop. Tight Government control of information had left Hungary with inadequate copying technology and services. There were probably fewer than 10 color photocopiers in the entire country. Here was an opportunity. Paul, who knew the typesetting business, liked the idea. We set to work.
Our first step was to seek a third partner with expertise in the copy business. We took in Dirck Holscher, 43, an old friend of Paul's and half-owner of a successful chain of copy shops in Washington. The three of us drew up a business plan, estimated our start-up capital at $200,000 and quickly agreed on rules to govern our partnership. We discussed the mix of machines and services, the volume of business necessary to turn a profit, marketing, staffing and all the other things that go into creating a new business. Isn't this impressive? I thought. The American way of doing business -- orderly, logical, responsible.

SOON AFTERWARD, ON A BUSINESS TRIP TO BUDAPEST, I VISITED a real-estate agency. I suspected that leasing space would be one of the hardest things to do in this venture, and I was right. Accompanied by a translator, I visited one of the largest agencies in town. I explained that I was looking for roughly 1,000 square feet of ground-floor space in the Fifth District, the central commercial part of town. Impossible, the agent said. There was nothing available in the Fifth District. I offered to pay a premium. The agent said she would look, and we agreed to talk again in a few weeks.
Budapest is a busy, imposing city of two million. Buildings from the 19th century still show their elaborate decoration, marred as it is by falling masonry and unpatched bullet holes dating from the battle between the advancing Russians and the retreating Germans in 1945, and also from the 1956 revolution. The Danube splits the city in two, and at night the lighted bridges and hills on the Buda side make an enchanting scene.
And yet for all its charm, Hungary is a hard place to get things done, for foreigners as well as for natives. Most Hungarians don't have telephones, and the phones that are available don't always yield a dial tone. Buying a train ticket can take several hours. Changing a plane reservation is often an ordeal, requiring a personal visit to the airline office or a branch of the state-owned travel agency. Creating a foreign-owned corporation takes six months: you need to get approvals from two different ministries and one court -- and Hungary is more advanced than any other Eastern European nation in its foreign investment laws.
Hungary is the Eastern European country that many people singled out as most likely to succeed in a free market. Well before revolution swept over Eastern Europe a year ago, Hungary had moved away from central planning and allowed a measure of free enterprise and foreign investment. The result was something called Goulash Communism. Westerners, however, often failed to note that Hungary still needed time to develop the constellation of habits that drive a capitalist economy. The country lacked accounting principles, a rational legal structure, clear-cut property laws.
Walking near my hotel one afternoon, I noticed many shops on fancy streets -- stores selling toys, fabrics, food, office equipment -- with no customers. This sight was familiar from previous trips, and I wondered how long these loss-producing establishments could continue to operate before the state, which owns most of them, pulled the plug.
I went to a Hungarian friend, a specialist in joint ventures, and asked for advice: how could we rent space in the Fifth District? She advised me to walk down the street, pick out the store we liked, then go inside and ask if we could rent it or form a joint venture with the user of the space. This struck me as a peculiar strategy -- and I did not follow it then -- but it wasn't bad advice. When a system is self-destructing, deal with its smallest parts.
Before long, the real-estate firm reported that it had found space for us. I brought Paul to Budapest, and he visited the sites. Then the confusion began. The agency informed Paul that to have the space we would first have to buy the right to use it, for around $200,000. (In Hungary, since 1949, there are essentially two different kinds of property rights: that of the owner and that of the user. The state owns most property, but often a state-owned company, cooperative or other entity holds the user rights.) We explained that we merely wished to rent a storefront, not buy one. The agency was unimpressed.
Later, our translator told us that the people at the real-estate agency had thought Paul a con man. He didn't wear a suit and tie, for one thing, and his manner was suspicious: he rejected outright the idea of buying a store or building, and he kept repeating what the partnership was after and what it was prepared to pay. All this struck the real-estate agent as a little pushy, undiplomatic, even tasteless.
The Hungarian way is to observe the formalities -- to respect one's opposite, to negotiate rather than say no, to respond politely, formally, even ornately. Hungarians are very careful to preserve the dignity of a situation. They will not telephone someone for you unless they know his full name. "Mr. X" will not do, and using the first name alone is unthinkable. They are punctilious about formal and informal usages -- not just the familiar and unfamiliar pronouns, as in French and German, but the linguistic decorum that they entail. Hungarians employ two different words just to say goodbye, depending on the formality of the occasion. They offer refreshments at every business meeting, to show respect for their guest. When a business discussion has concluded, it is common to adjourn to a large dinner with wine and toasts, even if the prospects of making a deal are obviously remote.
Something more than etiquette was at stake, however, in the charge of "con man." Moneymaking is still suspect in some quarters in Eastern Europe. Whether this suspicion predates the 1940's, and is part of an aristocratic disdain for commerce, or whether it is a cultural vestige of Communist rule is hard to tell; but a cultural bias against capitalism does exist. The pursuit of money is not widely respected; it is associated with greed, tawdriness and unfairness. As a consequence, some of the most visible new entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe have operated at the margins of acceptability -- money-changers and black marketeers. You cannot make money without cheating someone, a Romanian told me. Property is theft.
A few months later, we called up a Hungarian friend in a large state-owned company and asked if he knew of anybody with space to rent. He said he knew of another state-owned company that was having hard times and was looking for capital. Perhaps it would rent one of its many storefronts in downtown Budapest to stem the losses. This struck me as an excellent idea. Not only would such a deal help us, it would provide just what the Hungarian economy needed: an infusion of cash to revive a failing company while creating new enterprise.
Paul and I went to visit a retail shop owned by this company, and soon saw that many people were still working there. What would become of them? we asked. Our friend replied that this could be worked out. Not easily, it turned out. Later, the company director said yes, of course, we could rent the space, but the current enterprise would continue to operate from the premises. When we asked how this would work, the director proposed sharing the front door but partitioning off the interior. Odd though this may sound, many businesses operate this way in Eastern Europe because of the space shortage. We were prepared to accept such an arrangement. We left my Hungarian friend to work out the details.

THEN OUR TROUBLES escalated. The Hungarian Government began to review all the directors of state-owned companies -- some 20,000 bosses in all -- to determine whether they should keep their jobs. This review was perfectly reasonable -- some managers of companies were suspected of corruption, or just plain torpor -- and a thorough review would result in the strongest possible leaders for Hungary's leading enterprises.
Unfortunately for us, the review put a cloud over all negotiations, even negotiations as small as renting half of one little store for cash. Company directors were afraid that they would be accused of corruption, of disposing of company assets for personal gain. To ward off any hint of suspicion, in midsummer they simply stopped making deals for several weeks.
By this point, we had decided to cast a wide net. We had at least four people looking for space for us. An American manufacturer of copiers had agreed to supply our machines. Large institutions were prepared to sign on as customers. We had created an American corporation and had begun the lengthy process of creating a Hungarian company. All was ready, but we had no space.
One lead, a Hungarian construction contractor named Miklos, assured us he could find us a storefront. This sounded promising. Miklos, a hard charger, talked even faster than he drove, and whenever we saw him he seemed to have three conversations and three deals going simultanously. Surely, Miklos was our man.
But every meeting we had with Miklos tended to center on other issues. One day, he introduced us to a renowned environmentalist, and we talked about the looming environmental crisis in Hungary. At the next meeting, Miklos showed me designs for converting an ancient castle into a hotel resort and spa. (For a while, someone new would bring me a castle deal about once a week.) Then it was an import-export business that Miklos wanted to start with us.
This style of negotiating soon became familiar to us. We called it the Salami Syndrome. The experience is something like going into a delicatessen, asking for a doughnut and having the counterman offer to sell you salami. The discussion turns not on how much you will pay for the doughnut but on how much salami you will buy in order to get the doughnut.
At every meeting, we would steer the conversation back to our copy shop, and finally Miklos started to show us space. We looked at several shops in the center of the city and told him that any one of them would do. Miklos said: "Great. We'll put the jewelry store on the first level and the copy shop on the second." We said we didn't want to have a combination jewelry store-copy shop. Miklos looked disappointed and said the copy shop would never make any money, but he would help us anyway. We went with Miklos to the state-owned company that owned the storefront we liked best, and Miklos signed a letter of intent with the firm's counsel.
At last, we thought, we're getting somewhere. Soon, however, we discovered that Miklos had gone ahead and rented the entire space for his jewelry store, cutting us out. (In a year and a half of business transactions in Eastern Europe, this was the only instance I have encountered of double-dealing, which I suspect is a lower rate than occurs in the United States.)

BY NOW IT WAS Summer. The streets filled up with tourists, the weather was warm and Budapest was beautiful. Something else was changing, too: there were boarded-up storefronts, closed shops throughout the city. The new Government had begun cutting the national budget, which meant cutting subsidies to loss-producing firms, and as a consequence (or in anticipation of these cuts), companies were beginning to close down their stagnant stores. This was a painful, although necessary, step for the Hungarian economy; it was also one that opened the door to foreign investment like ours.
With renewed energy, then, in July and August we inspected dozens of storefronts in Budapest and held several negotiating sessions with the worried managers of bankrupt companies. The terms were similar in most cases: around 1,000 square feet for anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 a month, depending on the location. We also discussed joint-venture possibilities, in which event the concern firm would throw in the space and receive a percentage of equity in return. Sometimes the company would insist on a year's rent in advance, a practice also common in retail leasing in America. (A friend negotiating in Russia was asked for 25 years' rent up front, which struck him more as a World Bank loan than a lease.)
By September, we had three or four options and were entering the final stages of negotiations. One of the properties was owned by a large export company (state-owned, of course), whose manager, Sandor, insisted on taking us out to a lavish dinner after showing us the premises. For several hours, this elderly, charming man told us how he rose through the ranks of various state enterprises, first in the provinces, then in Budapest. It had not been an easy life, reading the minds of the apparatchiks in the hierarchy, but Sandor had always landed on his feet.
We drank toast after toast of sweet Tokay wine, pledging lasting friendship and fruitful collaboration between our two enterprises for years to come. When I rose to leave, he presented me with bottles of wine and kissed me on both cheeks. I left the restaurant charged with the warmth and strength of these people, steeled for hardship by a difficult history.
But I also left feeling that Sandor had been a little too emotional. One week later, we learned that soon after the dinner he had been dismissed and pensioned off, one of the managers who had not passed muster, perhaps deemed to be the old guard, not up to the task of managing the transition to free markets. Whatever the reason, Sandor was gone, and I thought, not for the first time, that if we found this transition hard to take, the Hungarians were finding it excruciating.
With Sandor out, we turned our attention to a former beauty parlor on Engels Square, near the Danube. It is close by Rosenberg Street, named for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the American Communists executed for spying. On Oct. 3, we put our deposit down and told the owner we would rent it. Five days later, we learned that Parliament had just passed a law prohibiting many transfers of commercial property pending a review by the State Property Agency; moreover, completed transactions, going back to the fall of 1988, would be reviewed by the same agency. The intent of the new law was to prevent corruption; the effect was to stop all transactions in their tracks, including ours.
Hungarians often refer to "the little door," meaning loophole. Everyone professes to be an expert at finding it. For 40 years, skirting the rules has been the routine method of doing business. But this time, it appeared, there was to be no little door. Not only did the law make it illegal to rent space without review by the State Property Agency, but flouting it was precisely the kind of suspect behavior that would endanger a manager's job in post-Communist Hungary.
We now had the odd experience of walking the streets of Budapest past boarded-up storefronts owned by bankrupt companies that were barred from taking our eagerly offered money. Our only recourse was to propose a joint venture with an existing store and thereby get the use of its space. One fellow operating a copy shop and printing store was eager to make a deal. But when we talked it over, we learned that he also ran an export-import business that he wanted to share with us -- the Salami Syndrome -- and that, moreover, he intended to continue running his own copy shop while being a co-owner of ours. Pressed about the possible conflict of interest, he replied that there was enough business to go around.
Conflict of interest is not a fully developed concept in Eastern Europe. During one public bid in which I participated, involving an environmental facility, the management of the bid was handled by a state-owned company, at the behest of the ministry sponsoring the bid. The state-owned company had hopes, like most enterprises, of becoming a private shareholding company. This became apparent at a discussion we held with its managers concerning details of the bidding process. During the discussion, the managers said that they would like their company to play a role in the project after the bid was awarded. I asked who would decide whether they would have that chance. The managers replied, "You will decide that, if you win the bid."
I was, of course, surprised that one of the judges of the tender should also contemplate negotiating with the bidders about his own share in the award. It seemed to me an insuperable conflict of interest. But this was one of my first public tenders in Eastern Europe. I have encountered the same thing several times since. Never is the proposal made under the table; in fact, the very publicness of the proposal indicates that nothing incorrect is thought to be occurring. Rather, in a system where 95 percent of the enterprises are owned by the state, one must necessarily have a state enterprise as a partner in any substantial venture. The confusion occurs because these same state enterprises are trying to establish themselves as private enterprises by raising capital, issuing stock to shareholders and making themselves profitable. Thus, the people running the state-owned company, who still have extensive claims on public power, access and privileges by virtue of their connections to the Government, also suddenly have very personal motives for making a deal.
Hungarians are keenly aware of this problem. That is why the Parliament has frozen transactions pending a review by the State Property Agency: to prevent current managers and foreign investors from making sweetheart deals. But the line between public and private is still blurred.
Privatizing with the right mix of efficiency and justice is only one of the problems facing Hungarians today. The average family income is $200 a month; the standard of living is extremely low. Prices are rising. The assumption that everyone will be taken care of, fostered by years of socialism, will be hard to change. So will the corollary assumption: that everything belongs to everyone. On one of my early trips to Budapest, I bought a book from the Museum of Fine Arts in German because the museum store had run out of the English version. A Hungarian friend told me to take the book to any bookstore downtown and exchange it for the English version. I was skeptical that any store would exchange a used book bought elsewhere for a new one. But he was right: with no questions asked, a clerk exchanged the German for the English book. My friend explained: "They don't care. It's not their book. In a way, they do not feel entitled to withhold the book from you."

MEANWHILE, WE HAVE taken an apartment in Budapest, now occupied by Paul. We have sent more troops in to join him and have hired additional Hungarians as well. All these people are working on several projects, all of them with a dollar value that dwarfs the copy shop. But our small venture is the greater challenge.
Paradoxically, the larger the deal, the easier the negotiation. You're dealing with the very top of the power structure, where it's possible to cut through the extraordinary bureaucratic accretion, the rules designed to thwart initiative in any state-directed economy. A Communist system is perfect for approving deals from the top; what it does not encourage or comfortably tolerate is individuals who come forward with an idea of their own to start an enterprise of their own.
The Hungarian system is no longer Communist; but it's not a free market yet, either. It's in transition, and because of that it is harder to do even the big deals today than it was a year ago. But we are stubborn -- in fact, obsessed. This has become a test of wills: against us (and the Hungarians) is a chaotic, rule-bound economy in the process of being confusedly dismantled. We do not intend to give up. We are still negotiating with a state-owned enterprise to form a joint venture. Under the proposed terms, we will invest money and management expertise; our Hungarian partner will contribute its flagship store and personnel, along with substantial experience in how to do business in Hungary. If the deal goes through, all we'll have to worry about is the collapsing economy of Eastern Europe -- and whether people in Budapest have a lot of documents to copy.

HEADLINE: 'Radical' Rap: Of Pride and Prejudice

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
One lesson of the 1990 elections was that politicians would rather not talk about politics -- taking sides on issues can be too risky. Mainstream popular culture prefers to stay on the sidelines, too, since there's no use in alienating a potential fan. When pop singers get earnest, the message is likely to be about compassion and charity rather than anger, resistance or placing blame.
The only militant messages headed for the pop charts appear in rap songs: a new contingent of self-described "radical" rappers are determined to carry serious ideas onto tape decks and dance floors. Three years ago, Public Enemy was the only rap group taking a combative stance on issues; now, half a dozen bands have followed up, while established groups make at least token efforts to be "righteous." 
 While uncontroversial, slow-chanting rap showmen like M. C. Hammer have sold millions of albums, rap is still so close to street level that some rappers have decided they have nothing to lose by stating harsh, even divisive convictions. Hearing the raps of Laquan, Movement Ex or Paris, who are among the better new radical rappers, is to hear the shape of urban debates to come -- on race, education, drugs and crime. The rhetoric heard in New York street demonstrations resounds in rap songs that urge black solidarity and demand an end to compromise.
To an outsider, radical rap is thoroughly mixed, an amalgam of unassailable facts, penetrating insights, arguable interpretations, anger, demagoguery, paranoia and hard-headed resistance. Its vision of America as a racial and economic battleground is apocalyptic. But that image is simply the flip side of the typical, 6 o'clock-news image of the inner city as a lawless jungle. From the inside looking out, radical rap assigns blame for the situation to powerful outside forces and promotes self-help as the only solution. While no one can promulgate a complete political program in a five-minute song, radical rappers do their best to hammer home their ideology.
 These rappers simply assume they are speaking to young black audiences, "Brother to Brother," as a song by Laquan puts it. To reach the listeners they hope to teach -- listeners more attuned to flashy electronic media than to books -- they often set their militant messages alongside boasts about verbal, pugilistic and sexual prowess. Their music is as individual as different disk jockeys and voices make it; Brand Nubian and Poor Righteous Teachers are jaunty and playful, Paris and Movement Ex are stark and somber, Laquan uses primarily live rather than recorded backup and lets slick pop choruses buoy his songs.
But the messages are adamant and, given the contentiousness of most rap, surprisingly unanimous -- in part because most radical rappers (beginning with Public Enemy) echo the teachings of the Nation of Islam, the Black Muslim group. The rappers are believers who ground their ideas in the unshakable tenets of their own variety of fundamentalism. When rappers talk about the "original Asiatic black man" and "devils," they are alluding to Nation of Islam beliefs that the first humans were black and were crossbred by devils to produce lighter and lighter races.
Radical rappers don't spout racist, anti-white rhetoric, although they do allude to Black Muslim genetic theories. In "I Deal With Mathematics," Movement Ex raps, "You ask who's the original and I reply I am/ At 200 degrees in the shade it couldn't be a white man/ Must know and understand that their skin has no melanin." More often, the rappers denounce white racism for specific malfeasances. "You want to erase my misplaced race/ Just to make America a beautiful white place," Intellectual Hoodlum snarls. As the successful re-election campaign of Senator Jesse Helms and surprisingly high turnout in Louisiana for the ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke suggest, racial tension generates a strong response.
 For radical rappers, black Americans are the victims of kidnapping (through slave trade), theft (of labor and culture), brainwashing (through education) and imminent genocide (through crack, AIDS and murder). The rappers urge re-education, discipline, unity and black self-reliance, while they are divided on how far to go in self-defense. Movement Ex declares, "In order to be free, you gots to have a shotgun." After rapping about the abuse that greeted a black march through the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to protest the fatal shooting of Yusuf Hawkins, Brand Nubian says, "I wanted to get violent but I'm a lover of black mothers/ And black mothers need sons, not children that's been killed by guns."
In some ways, rap is replaying the schisms of civil-rights activism in the 1960's. The ideas, and sometimes the recorded voices, of Malcolm X and of Black Panther Party firebrands have been revived by radical rappers; so have questions of cultural nationalism, of violence versus nonviolence, of evolution versus revolution. One difference is that the colloquy now takes place in recordings issued by major companies, which are happy to see activism turned into a profitable commodity. (Laquan raps, "Most of you want to do what I do/ State facts on wax and make a million or two," though he's not making millions yet.)
Another difference is that integration is not discussed, except to put down blacks who wear blue-tinged contact lenses or date whites. Racial separation is virtually assumed, but there's no simple "black is beautiful" equation; upwardly mobile blacks who have, as Paris puts it, "been trained/ To respect the game but you turn your/ Back on a black with the same claim" are targets for derision.
When it comes to practical matters, radical rappers agree with more established authorities. They denounce drug use and drug dealing; as the rapper Paris chants, "I'm above a thug/ Killin' off his own, tryin' to make a buck." And they urge listeners to practice safe sex: "You better wear a prophylactic/ 'Cause things are getting drastic," Brand Nubian advises. But they have little use for the authorities they see daily. For radical rappers, the police are a source of brutality and harassment, not order; in Paris's "Warning," five police officers shake down a 13-year-old -- "Up against the wall hands in the air/ Just wants to pump the fear" -- and the rapper vows vengeance if something like that happens to him.
 Up the political ladder, anger turns to disgust. Laquan's "Imprison the President" denounces Willie Horton commercials ("Frighten whites on election night"), the invasion of Panama ("Start a war, what the hell for/ Take him out he won't talk no more"), the savings-and-loan bailout ("The banks are bankrupt, the Congress corrupt") and "False prophets and demagogues/ Livin' large while the people starve."
Regarding education, radical rappers are Afrocentric. They have joined the current academic battle over what education should be in a multicultural United States. They insist that Africa, not Europe, is the original fount of culture, science and philosophy; X-Clan and Brand Nubian proudly drop the names of Egyptian places and deities. And they want to shift the cultural credit back to Africa, instilling pride in a younger black generation and revising the historical record (itself a matter of heated debate); some also want to revive African traditions and rituals, a tricky proposition in a modern industrial culture. Still, the emergence of radical rap cements rap's connection to the West African griot tradition, in which musicians carry history and commentary as well as stories.
The seminal radical rap group, still unmatched for musical innovation and verbal dexterity, is, of course, Public Enemy, which single-handedly raised the political stakes for rap. Before the rap era, performers like the Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron had linked political poetry and music, but by the mid-1980's most rap had turned away from their example (and away from hard-hitting early rap singles like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's "Message" and "White Lines") in favor of elaborate boasts.
Public Enemy's first album, "Yo! Bum Rush the Show," released in 1987, carved out a new place for rap, as its best songs moved beyond individual bragging to insist that rap could speak to, and for, a community of young blacks. The self-assertion that was implicit in earlier rap became explicit in lyrics by Carlton (Chuck D.) Ridenhour's lyrics, a demand for empowerment that was backed up by the music's corrosive atonality and Mr. Ridenhour's stentorian, syncopated delivery. Whether the band was perceived as invigorating or menacing, no one who heard Public Enemy could ignore it.
 Over the course of three albums, Public Enemy has been entangled in a continuing string of controversies. Yet the band's verbal and sonic rage, and Chuck D.'s willingness to examine topics from the F.B.I.'s infiltration of the Black Panther Party to media hype to white flight from cities, brought them an audience in the millions. Meanwhile, Kris (K.R.S.-One) Parker's Boogie Down Productions sold hundreds of thousands of albums with austere, didactic raps, using stripped-down drumbeats and a touch of reggae.
Part of the audience may have bought the albums for novelty value or the thrill of self-righteousness. But Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions also registered the sense of urgency as urban ghettos grow increasingly desperate and audiences want to know why and what to do. The bandwagon is now big enough for opportunists as well as idealists. As King Sun says, "Now everybody's wearing the red, black and green" (the colors of black liberation). Then again, King Sun's second album, "Righteous but Ruthless," marks a late conversion to righteousness; it has as many gangster (ruthless) raps as righteous ones.
 Radical rap has its thinkers and posers, and it is evolving fast. And despite the dogma and occasional wrong-headedness, it remains one of the most promising zones of popular music. It confronts problems with commitment rather than apathy or nihilism or escapism, and where most popular music promotes pleasure, radical rap urges listeners to seek knowledge before titillation (even if the specifics of that "knowledge" are sometimes dubious). Radical rappers aspire to be teachers, not gangsters. The question is whether they are building a movement, or simply a market.
 
 
ACTIVIST ALBUMS
 Here is a selection of new militant rap albums, listed in order of preference. All are available as LP's, cassettes and CD's.
"Movement Ex" (Columbia CK 46894): Hard-nosed arrangements and fast-talking, exclusively political lyrics, including a rare environmental-disaster rap and a song denouncing Santa Claus.
Paris: "The Devil Made Me Do It" (Tommy Boy 1030): Paris, who wants to revive the legacy of the Black Panther Party, has a 10-point program, a low, implacable voice and, as producer and arranger, an ear for ominous combinations of sounds. Raps like "The Hate That Hate Made," about escalating racial incidents, plunge into situations where nobody has a clear-cut moral advantage.
Laquan: "Notes of a Native Son" (Fourth and Broadway 444 029): Midtempo funk and jazz-funk, played primarily by live musicians, carry the somber rhymes of what may be the most serious 16-year-old in Los Angeles.
Poor Righteous Teachers: "Holy Intellect" (Profile 1289): Nimble, free-associative raps over riffs that change just often enough, like a more politically explicit De La Soul.
"Intelligent Hoodlum" (A&M 75021 5311): Percy Chapman, a k a Tragedy, raps about his experiences in prison and reprises slogans -- "America's a prison and we want to be released" -- as if he'd discovered them himself. Marley Marl's backing is stripped-down but propulsive.
Brand Nubian: "One for All" (Elektra 9 60946): A peculiar merger of sexual boasting, self-promotion and occasional political perspective. The lyrics carom around easygoing pop-jazz riffs, but Brand Nubian doesn't take its own advice: "Civilized man's main goal is to teach."
X-Clan: "To the East, Blackwards" (Fourth and Broadway 444 019): Incantations for the converted, full of references to Egypt, black American revolutionaries and "the crossroads," rapped in the artificial-sounding tones of radio disk jockeys.

Disenchanted, and Trying to Laugh About It

BYLINE: By David Richards

 BODY:
Whatever else it's remembered for -- and that will probably not be a great deal -- "The Big Funk" by John Patrick Shanley may nonetheless take credit for momentarily elevating the bubble bath to a position of prominence in the theater.
The cinema has always appreciated the peekaboo possibilities of suds, of course, and television soap commercials are forever showing us how mountains of foam make for a happy all-American family. But the last time I saw someone luxuriating in a tub on stage was a revival of "The Women" by Clare Booth Luce. The woman in question was a catty husband-stealer, and her willingness to loll about all day in hot water was equated with her brazen lack of morals. 
 Mr. Shanley has far sweeter purposes in mind, when the curtains at the Public Theater's Anspacher Theater part to reveal a pink and rose marble tub and in it, a very recalcitrant young woman named Jill (Jeanne Tripplehorn) whose experiences with the opposite sex have tended up to this point to be highly degrading. Only a few scenes earlier, in fact, we are privy to a characteristically disastrous date -- this one with a British lout, who plops a family-size jar of Vaseline on the cafe table and then says in a tone Rasputin would have applauded, "I think you want to get a little shiny. I think you want to get a little greasy."
Thereupon, while she sits passively and he hums "It's a Long Way to Tipperary," he proceeds to smear her face and hair with petroleum jelly. She is eventually saved from this humiliation by Austin (Jake Weber) -- an unemployed actor, the self-proclaimed hero of the play and, it would appear, Mr. Shanley's mouthpiece, although I should point out that all the characters spend a large part of their time sharing their musings on life and death with the audience. Viewing himself as something of a constructive person, Austin convinces Jill to come home with him and let him clean her up. Which is more or less how she winds up in that tub -- her teeth on edge and her body steeled against who knows what perversity to come.
But no. Austin is just what he says he is -- a man who's only trying to tidy up a small corner of a messy universe every day -- and he's put on a blue suit to show his honorable intentions. "This is so much better than fighting with people in the street," he reassures Jill, as he squeezes a wet sponge over her head and lathers up her hair. "The Girl From Ipanema" is playing on the tape deck, his touch is gentle and after a while even she has begun to wiggle her toes with enjoyment. Once she's whistle-clean, Austin helps her out of the tub, dusts her down with a circus-sized powder puff, then, surveying his work, proclaims proudly, "Good as new."
As Mr. Shanley himself has staged the scene and Mr. Weber and the beauteous Ms. Tripplehorn play it, it's oddly beguiling -- a little bit of Eden reclaimed from what the playwright clearly sees as a neurotic, self-destructive world, suffering from near terminal paralysis.
Were it not for a persistent optimism-in-spite-of-it-all (Mr. Shanley is, we shouldn't forget, the author of the buoyant screenplay for "Moonstruck"), "The Big Funk" could easily be mistaken for any number of anxious plays that came to be known collectively as the theater of the absurd a few decades ago. In them, language was turned inside out and shown to be useless. Human behavior was deemed unfathomable -- which reduced people to the status of puppets or automatons. Society was degenerating into chaos, God was apparently dead, and the big void, if not the big funk, was lapping up against life's very edges.
Mr. Shanley would seem to have no argument with that. He has even adapted many of the standard practices of the absurdists, discarding traditional narrative for a topsy-turvy structure that is held together as much by free association as anything else. Among his unconventional characters are Omar, "a family man," who for a living throws knives at a one-inch black dot from 35 paces; and Fifi, Omar's wife, who announces abruptly that she is pregnant with twins which she'll be birthing tomorrow. When Omar admits, "I'm trying to like break into a new way of speaking that'll rip the television set outta my head," we may presume that he's also expressing Mr. Shanley's ambitions as well.
Well, television "The Big Funk" isn't. But it isn't particularly captivating theater, either. Mr. Shanley's sense of the ridiculous and his social conscience make for a very uneasy blend. Off-the-wall reflections exist side by side with grand pronouncements on everything from fate ("a miracle that gives you a job") to happiness ("a side issue . . . it comes to you while you do other things . . . like grace"). The two don't complement each other so much as they tug the play in opposite directions.
The dinner party that constitutes most of Act II comes close to pure surrealism. Omar's wearing Viking horns. Fifi, the dutiful hostess, is armed with a four-foot pepper grinder. Jill is facing enough salad to feed an army of rabbits. The conversation is decidedly screwy. Before the coffee has been served, Austin excuses himself, disappears off stage and then reappears soon after, naked as a jaybird. We've all had dreams like that, although, unlike Austin, we don't necessarily cap them off by delivering a long, socially relevant speech.
Austin wants us to know, however, that we're tense and sweating and living our lives as if death were imminent, when we're the very ones, not destiny, who are responsible for this big thundercloud, this big funk, overhead. And just as we've created it with our anxieties, we can dispel it, if we "relax" and "be casual." I'm not sure the speech amounts to much more than Roosevelt's "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," retooled for the dazed 1990's. But Mr. Weber delivers the message genuinely under difficult working conditions.
Mixed signals are coming at us all evening long, however. Strangely as it sometimes behaves, "The Big Funk" is never giddy enough to defy gravity. Insightful as it wants to be, it is loath to admit to preaching, when that's precisely what it's doing. The most charming interlude is a wash. So, I'm afraid, is the rest of the play.
'Love and Anger'
In "Filthy Rich," his zesty 1979 tribute to all the grade-B detective flicks you ever saw, the Canadian playwright George F. Walker drafted a hard-boiled, ex-investigative reporter to fight the forces of corruption in The Big City. At best, the battle ended in a stalemate. Now in his comedy "Love and Anger," which is being given its American premiere by the New York Theater Workshop at the Perry Street Theater, he has put a lawyer on the job. But you can't call it a draw this time.
Either the privileged classes are becoming more entrenched or Mr. Walker's crusaders are becoming more inept. Actually, I suspect it's a matter of both. Mr. Walker is no less disenchanted with the times than Mr. Shanley is, although he relies on a more straightforward dramaturgy to depict chicanery in places high and low. His heavy is the ruthless publisher of The World Today, a big-circulation rag, who doesn't like anyone defacing his vending machines, let alone his reputation. Opposing him on wobbly pins is Peter (Petie) Maxwell, a high-octane corporate lawyer until a stroke reordered his priorities and brought him around to the side of the downtrodden.
Petie has no more principles than before, mind you. He's just decided to apply the lack of them to the goal of undermining "the entire institutional bias of our culture." Proclaiming himself a citizen of a new era, he explains with a feistiness that threatens his already shaky equilibrium, "I call this the age of getting even."
As played by Saul Rubinek, a schmoo-shaped dynamo when he isn't momentarily having one of his dizzy spells, Petie could be the fifth Marx Brother -- Pinko. He's got a pit bull's tenacity, an anarchist's madness and a tent preacher's indignation, and he's quite funny -- careering about the hole in the wall he calls an office or charging up the steps and out the door in pursuit of the evidence that will bring the publisher to his knees. (When it is pointed out that his pitiful evidence boils down to a few flagrantly doctored photos, Petie doesn't blink. "They can be improved," he snaps.)
Even funnier is Sarah (Deirdre O'Connell), a schizophrenic who has just been released from a mental institution and turns up in Petie's office, where she has little trouble fitting right in. Sarah believes deeply in the conspiracy of "beefy white guys" who surround small towns with their tractor-trailer trucks before taking them over. She tends to confuse males in evening dress with vampires and is not comfortable in the presence of pizza. Despite a tumble of red hair and a complexion that would be the envy of any Irish milkmaid, Sarah also thinks she is black. This makes her a natural ally, if an altogether unpredictable one, in Petie's assault on the citadels of power.
There is a lot of the young Sandy Dennis in Ms. O'Connell, who can inject a sudden gurgle of laughter into a lamentation or bring the tone of sweetest reason to bear on the most outlandish observation. The performance zigzags all over the lot, but hewing to some wild, emotional logic of her own, the actress never leaves you behind. In the play's best scene, she and the newspaper publisher (Arthur Hanket, adroitly walking the fine line separating sleek from oily) come to a meeting of the minds, although it's clear to us, if not immediately to him, that her mind has the general consistency of fruitcake.
Sanity is not quite so colorfully depicted by Mr. Walker. Still, you're not apt to overlook Steve Ryan, as an aspiring politican, well bred and better connected, who promises, "If I am elected, I'll keep a . . . what's that thing? . . . Open mind!" Or Kristine Nielsen, who was so vivid presiding over the switchboard in "Machinal" earlier this season and is here having an understandably rougher time maintaining order as Petie's Gal Friday. Or Tonia Rowe, who gets the whole play rolling when she enlists Petie to help spring her innocent husband from jail. ("Innocent?," he snorts. "More and more I hear that word less and less.")
Mr. Walker's characters are far and away what is most vigorous about "Love and Anger." In Act I, they sound one another out, draw up sides and face off in a stupendous cat and dog fight that threatens to demolish Petie's office and put them in traction for the next six months. From then on, though, a lot of steam goes out of the tale and the directors James C. Nicola and Christopher Grabowski don't seem to be able to do much about it.
Act II is given over to a mock trial of the newspaper baron and a second fight that can't hold a baseball bat to the first. By this time, Petie is growing short of breath and his eyes are glassing over. His tirades have turned to whimpers. All he and his unlikely cohorts have done is hold the rich and mighty temporarily at bay.
"This has got to be a place for winners," barks the publisher, with the authority of the victorious. "We've got to keep up the momentum. Let the slower people pick up the jet stream. That's our only choice. We've got to get richer. The only alternative is to get poorer."
Sound familiar? Consider "Love and Anger" a fitting addendum to the Reagan years. And know that the first half, at least, is nutty, knockabout fun.

HEADLINE: On the Road, Sleeping for Less

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE; BETSY WADE writes the Practical Traveler column.

 BODY:
IF you can survive on the road only with the aid of a wall-mounted hair dryer and a sauna, forget budget motels. They provide two small, thin towels, two cups, some soap and toilet paper, and that is about it for amenities.
If you want a comfy dinner without having to go outdoors, or, heaven forbid, want to call room service, pass 'em by. If you require someone to carry your bags or turn on the lights, you are in the wrong place. 
 But my nights of counting hangers and sleeping in five minimum-service motels, plus earlier stays in other chains, added up to a surprise for me. The rooms were uniformly clean; the mattresses were firm and new; the big color television sets all worked on the first try. None had shag carpets or bare light bulbs although only one could be said to be decorated. In the hard-budget category, you can measure the dollar saved by the bare walls and in the inch lost in towel length. But sight unseen, I would bet on a room at a budget chain motel against an unknown place along the road, even at a higher price.
In choosing the best low-priced motel, one thing is potentially more important even than brand name, and that is newness. When you reserve, see if you can find out how old the building is or if it has been recently renovated. When chain motels in the midprice bracket get too beat up to bear their names, they are sometimes renovated and slid into a cheaper category. Newer is cheerier. Worthwhile checking, too, is whether renovations are in progress.
In the last month, I stayed one night in Motel 6, Super 8, Econo Lodge, Red Roof Inn and Budgetel. All were in the vicinity of New York or Boston, so I did not get out into really cheap territory such as rural areas. Without taxes, the prices for two in a room ranged from $31.95 to $52.88. For one in a room, the bottom and top prices, without taxes, were $25.95 and $49. Taxes ranged from 6.75 percent to 9.70 percent.
Everyone was helpful to some degree, but these motels did not indulge in the elaborate courtesies of upscale places: the smiling question, "And how long will you staying with us, Madam?" is replaced by a polite, "How many nights?" And you get to your room on your own. There is no point in fussing about the view: it's either the parking lot or the highway.
"Minimum service" means that the motel does not run a restaurant, as was the case in all the motels I stayed in. It may be nestled among fast-food establishments, but if you want to go to a real restaurant it may mean an expedition.
In the morning, all five of the motels offered some palliative for those who leave before Denny's, Valle's or the Big Boy opens. At a Comfort Inn near the airport in Albuquerque, the porch off the lobby was set up as a free electronic serve-yourself kitchen with coffee, tea, microwave oven, toaster, muffins, cereal and juice. Most budget chains provide less, coffee and perhaps a machine dispensing canned juices for a price, possibly 75 cents. Day's Inn in Portland, Me., offers a carafe of fresh coffee in the lobby.
One drawback is that the security seems only adequate in most low-price places, probably a factor of the building's age. Good technology has recently been developed for secure room keys, but it didn't exist in these five motels. A budget motel I researched earlier, a Sleep Inn -- these are all new -- had doors that opened when I put my own credit card into a slot. (The slot on my room had been programmed to accept only my card.) But the five I surveyed last month all had standard metal keys with the room number marked but no motel name, a minimum safeguard. All had peepholes in the doors, however, also a necessity. Super 8 had a device inside to prevent the insertion of a key on the outside. Budgetel had one of these as well as a dead bolt and a chain. The Red Roof Inn had the same device and a dead bolt but no chain. The Econo Lodge had a bolt and a chain on both doors, but Motel 6 had no way to secure the door other than the lock.
All had smoke detectors, and the five-year-old Budgetel had a sprinkler. All had room phones, usually with local calls free. The Super 8 said it imposed a surcharge for long-distance calls placed with credit cards; the rest allowed free use of a credit card.
Towels ranged in length from 39 inches to 47 inches. All were white with no logo.
Here are highlights of my tour de motel.
 
Motel 6
 This chain, usually identified with its folksy Tom Bodett radio commercials, provides a room at a really low price; decor and extras have been reduced to the vanishing point. The room we stayed in in Deerfield, Mass., the cheapest of the five I visited, did not even have a box of tissues. There were two plastic-foam cups to be used for everything, although the clerk, when I asked, offered two additional regular plastic cups. The towels were the smallest I encountered, and the two bars of soap the tiniest. After I used one bar, it was clear that two were provided because one would not be adequate to lather truckers of the bulk I saw in the corridor. The device to plug the tub drain was gone in the plastic tub-shower combination, but fortunately I did not want to take a bath. The room was minimally furnished: a low, small table with two chairs, two comfortable double beds, a narrow wall shelf with mirror and a TV attached to a metal arm that came out of the wall opposite the beds with cables hanging loose. Two free movies a night were available on one channel. There were curtains but no pictures and no light in the vestibule-coat rack area.
Although the motel had a nice-looking heated swimming pool surrounded by potted plants and trees in a glassed-in wing, the people I saw at breakfast in the area next to it did not appear to have come there to swim.
Room payment is required the night before. Local calls are free; long-distance must be charged.
 
Econo Lodge
 Having stayed at an Econo Lodge in Orlando, Fla., I was prepared to learn in New Brunswick, N.J., that to get phone service I had to put down a $10 deposit or leave the total open on my charge slip although I had to sign it -- pay up -- the night before. I agreed to use my phone credit card. This meant that each time I called out, I had to ask the clerk to get the operator; the clerk stayed on the line until I had told the operator that I was using a credit card. This sort of thing, like unremovable hangers, does not interfere with comfort or safety, but it sure shouts "budget."
The room was spacious, with a double bed, a round table and four chairs with upholstered seats and a dresser containing drawers with a TV on top. The bathroom had the usual plastic built-in tub with shower but there was no plug in the tub here, either.
At the Econo Lodge, which had a gloomy off-season feel to it, the glass-box check-in area had a snug cluster of vending machines. One sold toothbrushes and aspirin and such; the machine that sold me 60-cent potato chips also offered condoms. The ice dispenser had a coin slot but no notice of what coin to use. When I asked the clerk, he gave me a token, and after I inserted it, one small pailful of ice tumbled down. I doubt that he would have given me enough tokens for ice to fill my cooler.
This motel had an outdoor pool in the center of its grassy quad, quilted and locked up for the winter.
The Econo Lodge offers the Super Video Cinema system: it allows you to rent a player and tape for $6.49 at the desk. I used the quite satisfactory FM radio in the TV and read by the light of the shaded lamp and its 100-watt bulb over the bed. A Sealy Hotel Special, it was perfectly comfortable. This Econo Lodge said it provides free coffee to guests at 6 A.M., but the office was locked and no coffee had been brewed at 6:30. The eating places next door were shuttered.
 
Super 8
 At this motel, the clerk I reserved with was helpful on driving directions and said, "Thank you for choosing Super 8." But when I arrived here, and at some of the other motels, mostly after 6, the clerks on the desk were barely this side of surly.
At the Super 8 in Danbury, Conn., I stared at the sign that said no one under 21 would be registered. It reminded me to ask for the 10 percent senior citizen discount, which I got.
Everyone at this motel must enter through the lobby, which adjoins a claustrophobic vending room with a free ice dispenser and an automatic brewer that provides free coffee and water for tea, as much you like. The place bustles in the morning.
My room had no curtains, but there were narrow-slat blinds in good condition. The bed was king-size, and it had extra-length pillows. Otherwise the room was Spartan, with one drawer for clothes.
The furniture other than the bed was an upholstered recliner chair facing the TV set, affixed to the top of the clothes rack. No remote control device, but there was a switch on the wall above the bed to shut the set off. A movie and a video player on the Super Video Cinema system could be rented for $6.49.
The bathroom had the standard new plastic tub-shower combination, but in a great splurge, the curtain bore the chain's logo.
 
Red Roof Inn
 This was the only motel in the survey where the No Smoking sign was not affixed to the outside door; in the room we rented in New London, Conn., there was a sign on the table saying the room "has been cleaned to remove tobacco odor." There was no particular odor.
This chain took a middle course between providing no tissues or a dispenser with a full box: a pocket pack of tissues with a logo, to my mind a fine solution because I felt free to take it with me.
This room, which had two double beds, was brightly lighted but was still somehow cheerless. The two chairs with the round table were wooden captain's chairs without upholstery.
The room had two pictures on the wall. There were no drawers: the counter along the wall had two shelves, and even the night table had a shelf but no drawer. "Impossible to leave anything behind here," my traveling companion said. The TV set had a shut-off switch on the wall above one bed. Free movies, three a day, were offered on one channel.
Red Roof Inns also make you pay the night before, although I did not realize it at the time. The charge-card slip was bopped, but I was not required to sign it then or indeed later. I did sign a slip agreeing to pay for all my charges. This expedient did serve to make me feel less sordid than at the sign-in-advance places.
 
Budgetel Inn
 This place was definitely more cheerful and more concerned with appearances than the other four. The clerks at the motel, in Auburn, Mass., said that it was only five years old. The room had pictures on the wall and a remote control for the TV set. Someone had throught about colors of lamp bases and chair upholstery. Not surprisingly, it was among the most expensive: a room for two with two double beds cost $51.95, plus tax. Entry to all rooms in the semi-futuristic building was through the minute lobby, but the lights from an adjoining small glass-walled meeting room reduced the cramped feeling.
The room was furnished lavishly in the context: it had two double beds, a desk with a chair, an armchair, two drawers in a dresser and two hunting prints on the wall. A four-cup Mr. Coffee automatic brewer was plugged in on the sink counter, plus two plastic-foam cups and a filter bag of ground coffee. The rest was less classy: packets of powdered creamer, sugar and artifical sweetner, plus plastic stirrers. A good gimmick was the glass ashtray upside down, with a sticker on the bottom saying, "This is a nonsmoking room." Seven movies were available on the TV at a charge of $5.95 a movie. In a switch on the familiar giveaway, The motel charged 50 cents for USA Today.
We laughed about the free Continental breakfast illustrated on the cover of the Budgetel directory, with the pastry placed so near the camera that it appeared to be the size of a Frisbee. We ordered this "room delivered" convenience, and sure enough, in a plastic bag hanging on our doorknob in the morning were two vending-machine-size Sara Lee danish and two four-ounce containers of orange juice.
We prepared coffee, I rinsed out the plastic cups to serve the juice, and we drove out of Auburn modestly fortified.
 
10 BIGGEST BUDGET CHAINS
 LISTS of the 10 biggest chains in the limited-service category shift almost by the day. Franchise-holders change loyalties; chains buy up each other's properties; individual owners may drop out of a chain.
Below is a list of the 10 biggest U.S. chains, on the basis of total rooms. Average daily rates sound ludicrous compared to actual rates in high season, but they are country-wide averages.
Days Inns has perhaps 1,100 properties with a total of 127,000 rooms. Most are run under franchise. Its average daily room rate in 1989 was $40 to $45. Day's Inns, bought in 1989 by Tollman-Hundley Hotels of New York, is now working out a plan with its debt-holders after a default on $325 million last month. A directory with prices and map may be obtained by calling 800-325-2525.
Motel 6, with 560 properties almost entirely owned by the chain, is owned by the French hotel company Accor. Its average daily room rate in 1989 was $25 to $27. The name dates from 1962, when the charge was $6 a room. A directory with insert of prices may be obtained by calling 505-891-6161.
Comfort Inns is a division of Choice, formerly Quality International. Almost all 600 Comfort Inns are franchised. The 1989 average daily rate was $40 to $45. Among other brands in the Choice group is Sleep Inns, a super-economy line begun in 1988. Sleep Inns are all built new, not renamed, with prices in the $29-to-$35 range. Eight are open now. A directory of Comfort and Sleep Inns, plus Quality and Clarion motels, is available by calling 800-221-2222.
Super 8 has 775 properties, mostly franchised. The 1989 average daily rate was $32.50. The name derives from the original 1974 rate of $8.88. An unidentified group of Hong Kong investors is taking over the chain in January. A directory may be obtained by calling 800-848-8888.
Econo Lodge, now owned by Choice, has 630 motels, almost all franchised. The average 1989 daily room rate was $36. A directory of Econo Lodges and Friendship and Rodeway Inns may be obtained by calling 800-553-2666.
TraveLodge, a national chain of 470 motels, is one brand name of the British-owned Trusthouse Forte Hotels. Half of the TraveLodges are franchised and half are chain managed. The average daily rate reported for 1989 was $39. A directory for the United States and Britain may be obtained by calling 800-255-3050.
Hampton Inns, a national chain of 200 motels, reported an average daily room rate of $43 in 1989. Most Hampton Inns are franchised; headquarters is in Memphis, and the chain is strongest in the East. A directory may be obtained by calling 800-426-7866.
La Quinta Inns' 200 motels are centered in Texas, the Southeast and California. The 1989 daily room rate was $39. Most of the motels are owned by the chain. A directory with an insert for prices may be obtained by calling 800-531-5900.
Red Roof Inns has 200 motels, mostly east of Texas, all company owned. Beth Shannon, a spokeswoman, said that the average daily rate in 1989 was in the mid-$30's. The directory does not show rates, which can be learned when a phone reservation is made. The directory does include a map and an index. It may be obtained by calling 800-843-7663.
Scottish Inns is a chain of 160 motels franchised by Hospitality International, which also comprises higher-priced Red Carpet Inns and Master Host Inns. The chain is concentrated in the Southeast. Scottish Inns reported a 1989 average daily rate of $23. A directory for all three groups with index and prices is available by calling 800-251-1962.
Not in the top 10 is the Budgetel chain, which ranks about 15th with its 82 motels, mostly east of the Mississippi. The chain, which has been growing fast since 1985, owns most of its motels; 14 are franchised. The 1989 average daily rate was $35. Budgetel was included in the survey because of its "free room-delivered Continental breakfast" promotion. A directory with prices and index may be obtained by calling 800-428-3438.
There are also two new names in the hard-budget category: HoJo Inns and Holiday Inn Express. Some of these will be conversions of higher-priced motels. When I called to reserve at a Holiday Inn Express for this article, the clerk told me that renovations were in progress, so I passed. -- B. W.

A Downtown Hartford Convention Center

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
SEVERAL cities are looking to convention centers as catalysts to invigorate their sagging downtown economies. While the Northeast's large-scale convention business is dominated by the 1.8 million-square-foot Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, smaller cities, hoping to scoop up trade that bypasses the Big Apple for costs or other reasons, are building their own convention centers.
 Construction is expected to be completed in Providence, Syracuse and Hartford within the next two to four years. Now in its site-selection process, the Connecticut center is scheduled to open in 1994 or '95. 
 "The first one in the ground is going to eliminate the competition," said State Senator William A. DiBella of Hartford.
 While 500,000 square feet is a maximum projected size, the Hartford center will initially have some 300,000 square feet, including 150,000 for exhibition space, 40,000 for meeting rooms and 30,000 for banquets, and parking space for 1,000 cars. The estimated cost is $150 million.
 By way of comparison, Syracuse's center is budgeted at $80 million for 208,000 square feet, including a 64,500-square-foot exhibition hall and parking for 1,000 cars. Construction, begun in October, will be finished late in 1992.
Providence will spend $120 million on a 365,000-square-foot center with 100,000 square feet of exhibition space and a 2,400-car garage. Work will begin on Jan. 15, 1991, for an opening in mid-1993.
 "The center will have a profound impact," said Warren Trafton, president of Hartford's Convention and Visitors Bureau. "It's projected to attract a quarter of a million people a year from out of state, attending 40 to 45 annual events. It will generate spending of about a half-billion dollars a year, as opposed to $50 million now spent on similar events."
 The 15-year-old Hartford Civic Center, originally intended as a convention facility, still books a limited number of small conventions into a 70,000 square-foot exhibition space. But its function over the years has refocused on sporting events and large-scale theatrical productions, leaving "a pent-up demand for convention space," said Mr. Trafton.
 After a site is selected in January the General Assembly must act on floating a $15 million bond issue for land acquisition. The architectural firms of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum in Manhattan, and Jeter Cook & Jepsom in Hartford, have been hired as co-designers of the project.
 Out of nine sites submitted by various landowners, three or four are expected to emerge for serious evaluation of size, cost, traffic congestion, proximity to transportation, entertainment and shopping, and the ability to attract a major hotel.
"The center and the hotel must open at the same time," said Frank Aieta, vice chairman of the state's 13-member Convention Center Authority. "We would not go forward without a hotel committment."
 Lack of business forced Hartford's Parkview Hilton and Summit hotels to close this year. According to Carl A. Candels, executive vice president of the Connecticut Hotel-Motel Association, based in Hartford, the Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Ramada and J.P. Morgan, with a total of 972 rooms, are doing better as a result.
"The insurance companies took more than 400 rooms and a substantial amount of meeting-room business away from the hotels when they began building their own conference centers," said Mr. Candels. "We are very concerned that when the convention center opens, it has at least 50 solid bookings for each of the first four years or the existing hotels will be badly hurt."
There are about 3,000 rooms in and around downtown Hartford. The proposed convention hotel would have 750 rooms.
"A convention center alone will not solve downtown Hartford's problems," Mr. Candels said. "Everybody is out in the suburbs. The streets close up at 6 P.M. We need more people living in the city, and we need to generate more shopping."
 Sage-Allen, a major department store, closed its flagship store downtown this year, and several individual shops are vacant. D & L's, a popular clothing chain, will close its store in the Hartford Civic Center Shops in January.
THE city administration is pushing hard for a convention site that consists of a privately owned parcel and a city-owned parcel at Trumbull and Main Streets.
"Deputy Mayor Charles Mathews made it clear that if it doesn't go on that site it will not have the support of the City Council," said Senator DiBella, who also favors that site.
 Mr. Aieta identified three sites as more viable contenders and his preferences: a 10.5-acre Columbus Boulevard site owned by Phoenix Mutual, Travelers Insurance and Gordon Interests; a six-acre site at Church and Allen Streets owned by Oakleaf Development Corporation, and a five-acre Spruce Street site owned by private investors.
"The state is offering the city of Hartford a gift," he said, in building the center there, "and the authority will not be intimidated by city officials.
 Asking prices compiled by Alphonse Marotta, State Representative from Hartford and a member of the authority, vary from $19 million for the privately owned portion of the Trumbull-Main location to more than $30 million for the Columbus Boulevard tract.
Another site, 4.25 acres at Constitution Plaza between Market Street and Columbus Boulevard, includes a small parcel where a city-owned jail and courthouse will be phased out in 1991; it is estimated to cost $37.9 million and involves acquiring and razing several buildings.
 The Trumbull-Main site, favored by Mr. Marotta, "allows for expansion onto the grounds of a public school soon to become defunct," he said, speculating that the privately owned parcel of 4.9 acres could contain the convention center and the hotel could be built on the city's 3.4 acres.
"The city is willing to provide incentives, like a land lease arrangement and phased-in property taxes over seven and a half years," he said.
 The lot is currently used for parking and it abuts the Holiday Inn, which the hotel chain bought back this month from Bass PLC, a British franchiser, for $12 million. It is just off the junction of I-84 and I-91 and Mr. Marotta suggested the inn could double in size on its own property instead of -- or in addition to -- building the convention hotel.
 John Tarantini, vice-president for Holiday Inns' eastern region in Washington, said "nothing is confirmed, but we will take a look at the size of the convention center and do a feasibility study."

HEADLINE: Talking: Insurance;
Getting Coverage In Co-ops

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
THE recent merry-go-round among managing agents for New York City's cooperative buildings is resulting in growing confusion over insurance. The difficulty is being compounded, board members say, by mislaid records, lack of long-term familiarity with the insurance history of each building and some glaring oversights.
 Consider the 30-unit co-op at 114 Morningside Drive on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The board thought it had successfully muddled through a parade of managing agents only to learn, said Gioa Shebar, the president, that "our directors' and officers' liability policy had lapsed and our fire insurance levels had never been adequately updated to compensate for inflation." 
 Making sure the building and individual shareholders carry the right insurance can be complicated, but a firm grip on the basic needs will help. For instance, the co-op corporation will always be responsible for insuring the structure and its common elements, such as elevators,hallways and the lobby, against a whole range of perils including fires and floods. This policy normally includes about $1 million of liability coverage.
 Shareholders will be responsible for insuring all personal belongings in their apartments as well as improvements made to the interior, carpeting, wallcoverings, applicances and fixtures. The goal is to be fully covered for replacement costs.
 For a 50-unit fire-resistant building with 100,000 square feet insured for $10 million, the annual structural premium should range from $8,000 to $15,000, depending on such variables as location and history of claims. Shareholder policies normally cost $175 to $3,000, depending on the value of contents and improvements. Board members will also need additional liability coverage against lawsuits, which can add $750 to $2,000 to the corporation's annual premiums.
 While this may seem straightforward, it is not easy because boards are being besieged by a growing number of insurance agents, each seeming to offer the best deal. Muriel Bishop, president of Muriel Bishop Insurance of Manhattan, an agency specializing in cooperatives, said co-ops -- especially newly converted buildings not served by professional management or those that have not yet forged strong alliances -- are seen by the industry as a lucrative source of new business.
 Some agents also are seeking business among mature co-ops with professional management. For example, Mackoul and Associates of Manhattan insists it can save almost any building 25 to 60 percent on premiums regardless of whether its current policies were written individually or by a managing agent who was able to offer a group discount.
 The reason, says Robert E. Mackoul, the president, is that many co-ops are still being classified as rental buildings by underwriters who are not fully conversant with the differences and who therefore are not making adjustments in premiums for what statistically is a lower-risk category.
 A board can start to make an informed decision by getting a copy of the building's policies, which may not be on the premises, since managing agents have traditionally kept their client's policies in their offices. These can provide the details that can best determine what modifications, if any, should be sought.
 It might be best to have one board member investigate the options. The board should then seek at least three bids, one of which should come through the managing agent, if the building has one.
Irwin Gumley, president of Gumley-Haft, managing agents in Manhattan with an insurance division, said bids should not be obtained until three months before the expiration of the existing policies because any bid is normally valid for only 90 days.
 Make sure, say experts, that each insurance salesperson is bidding on exactly the same coverage. The board should determine in advance exactly what it needs, said Ms. Bishop. To safeguard objectivity, she said, this should be done by someone who understands co-op insurance but is not bidding for the building's coverage.
SOME insurance specialists, such as Ronald Alford, technical director of Disaster Masters of Kew Gardens, Queens, have begun offering co-ops consulting services. One problem, he said, is that sales agents can be so persuasive that boards "buy more coverage than they really need."
 Mr. Gumley said it may not always pay to join the group put together by the building's managing agent. The policy for the physical structure, he said, is often better written individually since the group may include buildings that carry higher risk ratings, "and their claims history will affect your rates," he said.
 When evaluating bids, the board should make a list of specific perils to be excluded, said Mr. Alford, and then ask which might be included after all. "Most people don't know you can negotiate the terms," he said.
 For instance, Mr. Gumley insists it has become common to exclude water damage from wind-driven rain, underground seepage and water main breaks. But these can be included on request, he said, although the rider could cost extra.
 Further, said Mr. Gumley, the structural policy should cover the "full replacement cost" of any item, not its depreciated value at the time of the loss. Also, the building itself needs to be insured at no less than 90 percent of its true replacement cost to get full reimbursement for any structural damage.
 Most buildings also need a separate liability policy. It is rarely sufficent, experts say, to rely on the $1 million or so of liability coverage automatically included in the structural policy. Liability coverage can often be cheaper if bought within a group. But comparisons should still be made. The amount needed normally ranges from $5 million to $30 million.
 If the building is joining a group liability policy the board should find out in advance, said Mr. Gumley, if the coverage quoted is the total that can be paid out to all the buildings in the group in any given year, or if the limit is for each building.
 The co-op should also get a separate directors' and officers' liability policy since board members are unlikely to be protected under the general liability policy if they are sued individually. Further, the board must remember to ask each sales agent for details of the amount that can be saved by increasing deductible levels.
 Once bids are in the board should check the underwriters' ratings in the 1990 edition of the A. M. Best Rating Guide -- a profile of insurance companies. This is critical because some insurance companies are starting to suffer from the same financial shakiness that has been undermining banks and savings and loans.
 The board should also get long-term references on any new insurance agent before making a changeover. "At least one should be from a building that has been involved with the agent in a claim," said Brian Haviland, president of a 9-unit loft building at 34 East 30th Street, a co-op that recently revamped its coverage.
 When evaluating bids, the board should make a list of specific perils to be excluded, said Mr. Alford, and then ask which might be included after all. "Most people don't know you can negotiate the terms," he said.
 For instance, Mr. Gumley insists it has become common to exclude water damage from wind-driven rain, underground seepage and water main breaks. But these can be included on request, he said, although the rider could cost extra.
 Further, said Mr. Gumley, the structural policy should cover the "full replacement cost" of any item, not its depreciated value at the time of the loss. Also, the building itself needs to be insured at no less than 90 percent of its true replacement cost to get full reimbursement for any structural damage.
MOST buildings also need a separate liability policy. It is rarely sufficent, experts say, to rely on the $1 million or so of liability coverage automatically included in the structural policy. Liability coverage can often be cheaper if bought within a group. But comparisons should still be made. The amount needed normally ranges from $5 million to $30 million.
 If the building is joining a group liability policy the board should find out in advance, said Mr. Gumley, if the coverage quoted is the total that can be paid out to all the buildings in the group in any given year, or if the limit is for each building.
 The co-op should also get a separate directors' and officers' liability policy since board members are unlikely to be protected under the general liability policy if they are sued individually. Further, the board must remember to ask each sales agent for details of the amount that can be saved by increasing deductible levels.
 Once bids are in the board should check the underwriters' ratings in the 1990 edition of the A. M. Best Rating Guide -- a profile of insurance companies. This is critical because some insurance companies are starting to suffer from the same financial shakiness that has been undermining banks and savings and loans.
 The board should also get long-term references on any new insurance agent before making a changeover. "At least one should be from a building that has been involved with the agent in a claim," said Brian Haviland, president of a 9-unit loft building at 34 East 30th Street, a co-op that recently revamped its coverage.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

Liability of a Condo Board
 
Question: In the offering statement for the condominium I bought in a new building about three years ago, it was clearly stated that the building would be responsible for maintaining the exterior, including washing the outside of all windows. When I wrote to the managing agent about this I was told the board had not provided funds and windows would not be cleaned. I would like to see the condominium live up to its responsiblity to clean the windows without a suit. But would the board members be liable for failure to manage the building in accordance with the offering plan? . . . Charles Bradford, Manhattan
 
 Answer: Probably not. Stuart Saft, a lawyer specializing in real estate matters, said that while board members could he held liable for failure to carry out the terms of the condominium's offering plan, it would be hard to make a case that your board had acted ureasonably or in bad faith. "It would be different, " Mr. Saft said, "if, for example, the board members had used building funds just to have their own windows washed. It may be that the board decided that the best utilization of the condominium's resources did not include window washing."
Mr. Saft suggested you write to the board to find out exactly why the windows have not been washed.If you feel they are sufficiently dirty to need immediate attention, he said, you "could look for support among other owners for a special assessment to have the work done."
 
Low Water Pressure
 
Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan. Each time I shower the pressure drops to just a trickle. Is there a minimum level that must be maintained? . . . David Krakower, Manhattan
 
 Answer: Not exactly. The city's Housing Maintenance Code does not specify that water pressure be maintained at a specific level, but it does say landlords must provide an adequate amount of hot and cold water to all tenants.
"If water pressure is not sufficient to provide a tenant with water for washing and showering," said Roz Post, a spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, "then the landlord is in violation of the code."
To arrange for an inspection, call the Central Complaint Bureau in the Division of Code Enforcement at 960-4800. If it is determined that your water supply is inadequate and your landlord does not correct the problem, you can file a reduction-in-services complaint with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. You might be eligible for a rent reduction. Forms are available at all borough offices. In Manhattan they are at 156 William Street, ninth floor, and at 163 West 125th Street, fifth floor.
 
Adding a Name to a Lease
 
 Question: I am 76 years old and have been living in my apartment for 22 years. After my husband died last year my nephew moved in to assist me. My lease is up for renewal and I would like to add his name to it, but my the landlord said this is not possible. Can he refuse? . . . Jadin Dowling, Manhattan
 
 Answer: Yes. Landlords of rent-regulated apartments are obligated to add to leases only the name of a prime tenant's spouse. However, your nephew might have the right to remain after your death. Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said the rules that govern rent regulated housing gives certain family members, including nephews, who live with prime tenants 62 years or older or are disabled the right to renewal leases if the prime tenant dies. However, your apartment must be your nephew's prime residence. For more information call the agency's rent administration hotline, (718) 739-6400.

HEADLINE: Can Marketers Outsmart Real-Estate Slump?

BYLINE: By CHARLOTTE LIBOV

 BODY:
FROM chocolate fondue to cats to contests, Connecticut entrepreneurs are trying to find ever more creative means to entice prospective customers into spending in spite of a slumping real-estate market. Their marketing ploys include inviting cats into apartments and sweetening up prospective tenants with chocolate fondue, decorating the windows of vacant stores and going on the radio to seek prospective home buyers.
"This is the time for the fertile mind to really bloom," said Jerome Lowengard, a public-relations consultant in Hartford who has been in the field for nearly 40 years. He recently became president of the company that publishes The Business Journal, a biweekly publication serving Hartford and New Haven. 
 The tight economy provides an opportunity "for people who are supposed to be creative people to look at creative ways to do business," he said. "For years, all of us have been very complacent. Although we did it, we were doing it in a market that was receptive. Now we're doing it in a market which says, 'Challenge me.' "
 
'Most Depressed Man'
 William H. Heard, a former public-relations executive in Hartford, created his own campaign to sell his house in Glastonbury when his real-estate agent could not succeed. Mr. Heard, who was seeking to move to California, described himself in humorous newspaper advertisements and radio commercials as "the most depressed man in a depressed real-estate market." He sold the house and now works for a public-relations company in Los Angeles.
Although most house sellers do not have Mr. Heard's advertising background, he said there are lessons to be learned from his success.
"There is nothing wrong with the standard tactics that real-estate agents have always used in a good market," he said. "But in a poor market, they have to reach out for other solutions and gimmicks."
Vacant office space posed a problem for Stanley Seligson, a developer and real-estate agent in Norwalk. "Probably as much as anything else, the perception in the minds of purchasers or people who will lease space is that this is a bargain environment," he said.
He was faced with overcoming that perception in two of his developments, he said, an eight-store retail plaza that includes a branch of Loehmann's, the discount clothing chain, and a new bank building with unrented space.
When he tried to market space at Loehmann's Plaza in a converted factory building in Norwalk, "we felt the historic nature would lend something," he said. "But people would say: 'What a mess. It's an old building.' So we put a mural up, to show people what it could be."
The mural, painted by Brechin Morgan, an artist from Westport, shows prospective tenants how the plaza will eventually look. It depicts a galleria with banners, plants and a fountain.
In the case of the new Connecticut National Bank building, also in Norwalk, Mr. Seligson enlisted the help of another Westport artist, Marlene Siff, in helping decorate some unrented office space. At his invitation, Ms. Siff filled the office building with her large, colorful geometric paintings and sculpture.
"For the bank building, we were surrounded with things that weren't moving, so we decided to create our own enviornment," Mr. Seligson said. Since the building already had tall ceilings, the white walls gave the space "a gallery look," he said.
"We decided to make it a gallery and focus our attention on something that was kind of upscale, and in came Marlene Siff," he said. "We thought her work was very special, in that it had a corporate look."
Mr. Seligson also acted as host at a party sponsored by the local Chamber of Commerce, to draw additional attention to the building.
"In real estate, like everything else, people, if they're looking for quality, want to get it, if it's the best," he said. "If I just said, 'Twenty thousand feet available,' nobody would believe it, unless they came and saw it. I can't say we've signed a lease as the result of the art show or the chamber party, but I can say there's been a lot of interest."
 
Chocolate Party
 Ms. Siff said the collaboration with Mr. Seligson is paying off for her. The show gave her the opportunity to display her work and increase her corporate contacts.
"It's very difficult for artists to get their work out there," she said. "It takes a lot of time and a lot of effort and pulls you away from painting."
With more and more commercial and residential properties on the market, just attracting brokers can be difficult, said Marc L. Nevas, a developer in Westport. This fall, when he began marketing his latest office building, Old Hill, he threw a grand-opening party aimed at brokers. To entice them, he created a "chocoholics theme," he said. "We served different kinds of chocolate fondues, with tropical fruit and poundcakes for dipping."
The party featured live music and a caricaturist to sketch guests. As a result, 70 brokers showed up, Mr. Nevas said, and many stayed for two hours. "Our goal was to get as many brokers as possible and keep them there as long as possible," he said.
Such promotion takes effort and money, but "I think you don't have a choice in this market," Mr. Nevas said.
Those seeking to renting apartments also need creativity these days, said Deborah Robinson, the marketing director for the 583-unit Clemens Place Apartments in Hartford. About a year ago, she hit upon the idea of advertising apartments for cat lovers, and has not regretted it, she said.
 
'Lots of Sunny Windows'
 "Typically, apartment owners don't want to encourage lots and lots of cats," said Ms. Robinson, a cat owner herself. "But we're in a slumping market and pretty competitive one, so we decided this could give us an edge and reach a market we weren't addressing."
"Cats Now Playing At Clements Place," said her advertisement. "Some of our best residents are cats. With lots of sunny windows to bask in and lots of nooks and crannies to nap in, we're a natural for your feline companion."
Ms. Robinson said: "You can't sit back anymore. During the 1980's, developers went in, put up property and didn't market it. The places sold themselves. It's not that way anymore. Nowadays, you can't open the door and wait for the traffic to show up, because there's very, very little traffic."
Vacant stores can even provide an opportunity for those who seize it. With the closing of some retail stores in Hartford, including the Sage Allen department store, Wilson Faude, executive director of the Old State House museum, said he was unhappy with the prospect of all those dark store windows, especially at Christmas time. He could not think of anything more bleak, he said, so he offered to fill the Sage Allen windows with merchandise promoting the museum's store.
Mr. Faude got other downtown merchants to join in decorating their own windows and those in the vacant stores. That was the beginning of the Great Hartford Window Contest. About 100 merchants are participating, he said, and "I'm about to run out of windows."
For the contest, 35 clues have been placed in store windows. Each clue refers to a word, and when put together, the words make up "a great Hartford quote," he said.
Participants will be writing their guesses on slips of paper and depositing them at participating merchants. The contest ends on Jan. 1, and the winning entry will be drawn from all those with correct answers on Jan. 10. The prizes include free dinners, first-edition books and shopping sprees, said Mr. Faude.
"To make a city work, you don't have to have a big wallet," he said. "Now I've got store owners calling me and asking, 'How can we get into the window game?' .
"It's also pulling everyone together. They're not just moaning about how bad things are. We've got everyone on this. It's a kick, and the cost is basically zero."

HEADLINE: A Report on Blacks Elicits Support

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
LEADERS of Westchester's black community began to look beyond a 165-page indictment of its status in the county last week to the economic, social and political changes they say are essential to reverse a continuing decline in the position of blacks.
Some of the likely changes include strengthening and enforcing a six-year-old executive order designed to increase the level of participation of blacks in county contracts. The order, issued by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, was limited to construction contracts worth more than $100,000. Most minority-owned companies could not participate at that level. 
 Other changes that black leaders have indicated they will seek are improved coordination and planning among county departments and improved delivery of services, such as using churches and community centers, where minority families are comfortable, rather than schools and government agencies.
 
Not Depending on Government
 Efforts will also be made to encourage greater involvement by successful blacks in helping to improve the plight of others who are less successful. "We can no longer depend on the government to do everything for us," said Herman Keith, a County Legislator from Yonkers,
"Few people I know got where they are on their own, without someone extending a hand or making a phone call," he said, adding that such "networking" in the business community was practiced less among blacks, "many of whom are not aware of the condition we're in."
A report outlining that condition, a survey of Westchester's black community, was prepared by the African-American Advisory Board, formed by Mr. O'Rourke in 1987. The report, delivered earlier this month, was described by Mr. O'Rourke as revealing a "sadness and a feeling verging on hopelessness." The County Executive pledged support for the report's recommendations, which cited housing, economic development, criminal justice, drug and alcohol abuse and education as areas requiring improvement.
One of his first steps, Mr. O'Rourke said, would be "to make a pledge in 1991 to take back the streets in Westchester County." He was reminded during a question-and-answer period after the presentation of the report, however, that his proposed 1991 budget all but eliminated the War on Drugs program, an educational effort.
 
An Idea From a Historian
 The idea for a survey of the black community in Westchester began with John Harmon, a black historian, who approached two county legislators, Mr. Keith and Ernest D. Davis of Mount Vernon.
"It was his suggestion," Mr. Davis recalled, "that we form an African-American advisory board to get a cross-section of blacks that could focus intently on the problems we faced."' Mr. Davis said the Board of Legislators "did not want to deal with it and asked us to take it to Mr. O'Rourke, who took it over and appointed its members."
The appointees, a cross-section of corporate, civic and church leaders; educators, social service experts and others prominent in the black community, were selected by Mr. O'Rourke. But they did not spare the County Executive and members of his government from criticism.
In presenting the report, J. T. Childs Jr., an International Business Machines executive who is chairman of the advisory board, said there was "a total lack of awareness by county government" that blacks were participating "only in the smallest way in the abundant opportunities available in Westchester County."
The proposed 1991 budget, Mr. Childs said, "is the antithesis of the recommendations of this report." He said the contradiction could be resolved by "executive leadership" to bring about "even-handed funding, funding that does not balance financial responsibility at the expense of the poor."
Mr. Childs said blacks represented 12 percent of Westchester's population, or nearly 105,000 people, but that 80 percent of the county's homeless and 68 percent of its prison population were black. Sixty-three percent of the county's blacks completed high school and 12 percent "have some college background," the survey reported.
 
A List of Problem Areas
 "No discussion of the African-American condition in Westchester can be held without recognition that race has played a role in the outcome," Mr. Childs said. The evidence of "exclusion based on race," he said, is "evidenced by chronically high unemployment rates, poor and segregated housing patterns, high infant-mortality rates, drug and alcohol abuse, poor health and susceptibility to disease, inferior education and the disproportionate number of African-Americans in the criminal justice system."
Mr. Childs said the county lacked a clear policy to promote black business growth. The report said the county should expand and strengthen the Office of Affirmative Action, ask county agencies for plans to better use minority-owned businesses and direct programs for the black community toward serious economic development.
Housing problems for blacks, the report found, "have reached a point of crisis in some areas of the county." In 1980, one-half of the housing units in the county were rental; by 1985, one-fourth of those units had been converted to condominium or cooperative apartments. During that same time new construction declined.
These factors had a serious impact on black families, whose average earnings in 1980 were $19,726, compared with the $36,283 earned by white families. The report recommended the development of a "fair share" plan for providing affordable housing, with strong incentives for communities to meet targets set by the county, like a surcharge on local property taxes for failure to do so.
In the area of criminal justice, "recent national data indicates that 25 percent of black males are incarcerated," Mr. Childs said. In Westchester, the same percentage of black males "are involved in some element of the criminal-justice process."
 
Racial Bias Is Cited
 The report said that the group had found racial bias in all the areas studied and that this was a "key contributing factor to the increasingly high rate of African-Americans in the criminal- justice system." It called for local projects that would increase contacts between the police and blacks, more patrolmen on the beat and "satellite" police stations in schools and community centers.
Mr. Childs said 80 percent of the offenses that led to the incarceration of blacks were drug-related. In 1988, he said, blacks represented 66 percent of Westchester County drug arrests. The report called for greater drug outreach, especially among children, and better treatment programs.
The county's educational system "does not serve poor students well," Mr. Childs said. Among blacks who entered the ninth grade in 1981, 54 percent failed to graduate with their class in 1985. The report recommended creation of an Office of Early Childhood Services, innovative programs to identify and monitor dropouts as well as adult literacy programs and training for single mothers.
Mr. Childs suggested that all these areas were interrelated. "If I can't find a job or it's a low-paying job, that will influence where my housing is, and that will influence where my children go to school and that will determine who their friends are, and their habits.
"The report shows we're not dealing with a one-acre lot; it's a big farm with a lot of plowing to be done and a lot of places to plant seeds," he said.
The initial plowing will be done by the Whart Development Company of Yonkers, which conducts studies and serves as a consultant to small businesses and to municipalities involved in revitalization.
 
Implementing the Suggestions
 Ruth H. Thompson, president of Whart, which prepared the report, said, "We will be submitting a proposal to the County Executive with the kinds of things we think he can do to help implement the report's recommendations." She said he was expecting it by next summer.
Mrs. Thompson said she would also be working with government departments, "which do a fairly good job but don't coordinate well." Different departments may deal with the same people, she said, "but they're not always cognizant of what's going on with that same family."
Asked if there was a need for blacks to find ways to help themselves in the face of shrinking government budgets, Mrs. Thompson offered this example:
"When I was working with one of the county agencies, we talked about a substance-abuse prevention program that currently exists in the schools, and the concern that there were very few participants.
"There is a tendency on the part of agencies to establish programs in minority communities, but they don't work because of the facilities involved. People are much more comfortable attending a church than they are attending schools or other kinds of institutions."
The report was issued on the ninth floor of the County Office Building here, Mr. O'Rourke's office, while one floor below the Budget and Appropriations Committee of the Board of Legislators was seeking to restore some of the social services cut back or eliminated by the County Executive in his budget proposal.
Mr. Keith said it was telling that none of the seven members of the Budget Committee "had any concentrations of people of color in their legislative districts." Mr. Davis, who is black and represents Mount Vernon, a city with a heavy minority population, had been a member but was replaced this year by Audrey G. Hochberg of Scarsdale.
"I'm not questioning the sensitivity of the Budget Committee members," Mr. Keith said. "But what's missing is some knowledge of the urban centers where 80 percent of the people of color in this county live.
"We can't afford to lose the cities of Westchester's south and the people who live there just to reduce the property-tax rate increase, to keep it at a number that is satisfactory to the wealthy and more affluent of this county. I'm a property owner and I don't mind paying a couple of extra dollars if it's going to help keep a kid out of jail or help him find a job, or help a mother who needs Head Start to keep herself off welfare."
Mr. Davis said the members of the African-American Advisory Board were distinguished, "but they represented a sameness: there was too much professionalism on that board."
Mr. Davis added that "everyone was polite and nobody was angry except Walter Brooks," the president of the Ossining branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, "and he was right."
Mr. Brooks said at the report's presentation that the survey "leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the class composition of the committee; we miss the working class. When you begin to recommend satellite police stations," he said, "you know something is wrong."
Later, Mr. Brooks added: "The input to that report was all middle-class values. The report failed to deal with politics."
Mr. Childs said the report represented "all elements," including those who testified at a public hearing, and was "based on an enormous amount of discussion."

HEADLINE: Lights on Tappen Zee Celebrate 35 Years

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DeCHILLO

 BODY:
ON Dec. 15, 1955, the first automobile crossed the Tappan Zee Bridge. On Dec. 18, the first car crashed on the bridge. After 35 years, the three-mile bridge that snakes across the Tappan Zee from Tarrytown to Grandview in Rockland County carries 38 million vehicles each year, collecting more than $42 million in toll revenues and still generating a lot of controversy.
To celebrate the anniversary of the opening of the bridge, lights outlining the superstructure are to be turned on this weekend. The "necklace lighting," as it is known, is the same type that illuminates the George Washington Bridge, 15 miles downriver. 
 "It's a holiday present to the area," said Peter Tufo, chairman of the New York State Thruway Authority and the one who came up with the idea of putting the lights on the bridge. The lights were incorporated into plans for a safety-ropes system and navigational lighting already in the works.
"With the shimmering white lights on the trusswork and the red aviation beacons on top of each tower, it looks like a Christmas tree," said John Marich, the project manager for Herbert G. Martin Inc., the Yonkers electrical contractor that did the job.
Not everyone is enchanted by the lights. "People aren't going to like this," explained Robert Edwards, supervisor of the painting crew on the span. "Everywhere the roads are a mess, and these lights are just a thing of beauty."
The necklace consists of 35 mercury vapor lamps on each side of the superstructure and are part of a metal stanchion and wire rope system that allows workers to move more safely around the top of the bridge. Rockland and Orange Utilities will supply the electricity for the 70 100-watt lamps. The electric bill will run $1,500 to $2,000 a year.
 
A Prediction by Dewey
 Few people saw the enormous changes the Tappan Zee Bridge would bring to the region, but former Gov. Thomas E. Dewey sent a telegram to the opening-day ceremonies in 1955 saying, "This bridge alone is a symbolic span over which Westchester and Rockland Counties will move virtually overnight 20 years into the future."
Long gone are the ferryboats that provided the only link between Westchester and Rockland Counties south of Bear Mountain before 1955, but they didn't operate after dark, in bad weather or when the river froze.
"For better or for worse, the bridge has made the world a much smaller and faster place," said Mr. Tufo, adding that the populations and economy of Rockland and Orange Counties have grown dramatically in the last 35 years.
Yet the span at the Tappan Zee may be a victim of its own success. Rush-hour congestion on the bridge and on the approaching roads are a nightmare to drivers and local communities. "When the bridge was completed in 1955, we were a sleepy little village community," said Eileen Pilla, Mayor of the village of Tarrytown. "The bridge brought tremendous changes. Since then we've become the hub of Westchester because of our location on the river, the Thruway, the Expressway and the Parkway."
 
'Inundated With Traffic'
 While the bridge has been a positive thing for Westchester, she said, "We find ourself just inundated with traffic. If there is a slowdown or an accident on the Tappan Zee, our village becomes a total parking lot."
S. J. Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association, a business group, called the Tappan Zee Bridge congestion "a serious threat to the economic vitality of Westchester."
"When the bridge opened you could play baseball on it all day long and not be interrupted by a car," said Mr. Schulman, who was then chief planner for Westchester County. "The bridge has been integral not only to the residential opening up of Rockland County but also to the economic development of central Westchester. I call Route 287 a linear breadbasket, but it is a breadbasket supplied by a labor force that drives across the bridge from Rockland County."
The bridge was designed to carry 100,000 vehicles on six lanes on a peak day, or yearly traffic of 27 million vehicles. With the addition of a seventh lane 18 months ago, the bridge carries 38 million vehicles a year and continues to exceed the traffic capacity for which it was designed.
The Thruway Authority is currently looking at a number of short-term solutions to the problem that could be instituted when it replaces part of the deck of the bridge in 1992.
One possibility would be to eliminate all walkways on the span and expand the bridge to eight lanes, four in each direction. Another is to install a movable concrete barrier system, permitting the addition of a temporary lane in the direction with the heaviest traffic flow. The third short-range solution would be the addition of extra lanes on either side of the bridge by sinking floating new bridge supports.
Mayor Pilla wants the movable concrete barrier system installed in 1991. "We can't wait until 1992, we need it now," she said. "It will not take away the problem but it could dramatically alleviate our congestion." Petitions are circulating in Tarrytown, asking the Thruway Authority to install the movable concrete barriers as soon as possible.
"We're also asking the Thruway and the Westchester Expressway to implement high-occupancy vehicle lanes for commuters," Mrs. Pilla said. "We are very concerned in Tarrytown about the talk back in 1987 concerning a second Tappan Zee bridge proposal. We are totally against that. Accommodate the cars that are already on the road, but don't pave us over because there will be more cars to fill it up.
"Our neighbors across the river in Nyack, Suffern and Grandview are very much against a twin bridge, too. We've seen what the bridge did to us in 1955. We don't want the traffic. We've done our share."

HEADLINE: For Many, Neediest Cases Fund Is a Chance to Hope Again;
Finding Quiet Home for a Broken Heart

BYLINE: By DANIELLE M. DELINCE

 BODY:
Like many emigrants who flee their homelands in search of economic, political and religious freedom in the United States, Andres D. left the Dominican Republic 27 years ago for greater opportunities.
He settled in the Bronx, then later moved to Staten Island. For many years he worked as a welder and a janitor at an apartment building in the Bronx, providing for his wife, Eduarda, and their four children. He saw his children through high school and college: One is now an engineer, one is a minister, another is a bank manager and the fourth is an accountant for the city. Family and faith were the underpinnings of his life. 
 But in January, Eduarda died after a long illness and -- after 60 years of marriage -- Andres found himself lonely and depressed. He moved in with a daughter who lives in the Bronx with her husband and adult sons.
 
'I Did Not Know What to Do'
 The crowded house, with loud merengue, jazz and rock music constantly blaring, proved to be too unsettling for 88-year-old Andres, who had become accustomed to solitude in his former home. He stopped eating and "would not touch anything in the refrigerator," his daughter, Rosa, the bank manager, said in a recent interview.
"My dad really needed to be with people of his age," she added. "He was very attached to his memories and I did not know what to do."
Rosa sought help from her employer, who knew about a housing program for the elderly that was operated by the Community Service Society, the nonprofit agency that has been an advocate for New York City's poor since 1847. It is one of seven charities that receive contributions from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Through its Enriched Housing Program, which has been in operation since 1979, the society provides housing and housekeeping assistance for people over 65 who -- like Andres -- are capable of living on their own.
The housing program is but one of many projects of the society, which shifted its focus in the early 1980's to address issues of homelessness, health and education as services declined and the demands for them became greater.
But "the most important element of the society's work is its academic approach to the basic problems of the poor," said Dwight Langhum, the society's director of special projects,
 
Soup Kitchens and Reading Help
 It publishes periodic reports on conditions that affect the poor and proposes solutions to government and private social service agencies. It also promotes participation in elections and in the last two years has registered some 135,000 voters.
Through its Retired Senior Volunteer Program, some 10,000 volunteers work in soup kitchens, teach adults to read, and assist in museums, libraries and schools.
The Society, which has an operating budget of $14 million, received $1.7 million from the Neediest Cases Fund's last campaign.
Five months ago, Andres became one of its thousands of beneficiaries when he was placed in a one-bedroom apartment in the Randall-Balcom housing project in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx. Designed for the elderly, the three adjoining red-brick buildings are home to several hundred men and women who find comfort in helping each other. Andres is one of 10 residents who are being assisted through the Society's housing program.
Each day about 9 A.M. a social worker, Idesia Bastos, calls to check on him. And two or three times a week a housekeeper does his shopping, making sure he has at least a three-day supply of food. She also cleans the apartment and does the laundry. Just as importantly, though, Mrs. Bastos and the housekeeper provide a bit of companionship.
 
'They Take Good Care of Me'
 "This is a cheaper and more pleasant alternative to a nursing home," Mrs. Bastos said.
Mrs. Bastos tries to make the residents' apartments as homey as possible -- she bought white lace curtains for Andres's living room and bedroom -- and she tries to make their holidays brighter. She has promised Christmas presents for Andres and his neighbors.
"They take good care of me," he said through an interpreter. He even acknowledged that he had gained a few pounds.
Andres, a shy, private man, lives in his apartment surrounded by symbols of his faith -- a blue-and-white wall-hanging in his bedroom proclaims "Mi Corazon Pertenece A Cristo" (My heart belongs to God) -- and photographs of his family, including his nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. But most of all, there are memories of his beloved Eduarda.
He brightens as he talks of their 60 years together and reverently looks at a small black-and-white photograph of them that was taken on their 25th wedding anniversary.
In his bedroom is a wooden plaque given to him and Eduarda by their children for their 50th wedding anniversary 10 years ago.
A tidy man, Andres gets up every morning about 7, makes his bed, prepares his breakfast, watches the news on television and waits for his daily calls.
At midday he goes to an adjacent building to have lunch with the other residents. As the only man in a crowd of ladies, Andres gets a lot of attention. But he does not say much because he speaks very little English and, he said, "I am embarrassed by my accent."
Andres often walks to a neighborhood grocery store for milk or bread and takes frequent walks in a nearby park.
In many ways Andres seems very content with his current life. Still, Mrs. Bastos said, she often finds him weeping silently.

Students Fight A Dress Code From the 60's

DATELINE: PROVO, Utah

 BODY:
Although shorts, sweatpants, sockless feet, long hair and beards are commonplace on most university campuses, they have been forbidden for more than 20 years at Brigham Young University, which is owned by the Mormon Church.
Now, the school's Student Advisory Council is proposing a new dress code that would eliminate restrictions some students call illogical and would establish more minimal restraints. 
 The dress and grooming standards the students are challenging were imposed during the restive 1960's as a section of the student honor code. Administrators said the rules were meant to set B.Y.U. students apart from the spirit of rebellion then sweeping other campuses.
Any change in the code would need to be approved by President Rex Lee and the university's trustees, most of whom are church leaders. In October, Mr. Lee created an Honor Code Review Committee of faculty, staff, administrators and students, to consider whether the codes should be changed.
Mr. Lee last week declined to comment on the student proposal until it is formally presented.
 
 Not Immutable
 There have been some changes in the dress code over the past two decades as students have tried to reassert more control over their conduct. Women, for example, were required to wear skirts or dresses. In 1971 they won the right to wear slacks; in 1981, jeans were approved. Today, they are still prohibited from wearing hemlines above the knee, strapless dresses or sleeveless shirts. And the code still states that the "no bra look is unacceptable at B.Y.U."
Other standing rules include the requirement that "men must wear socks with shoes" and that "approved hair length is interpreted as less than one-half inch over the ear. Hair must be above the collar in the back." Beards are prohibited, well-trimmed mustaches are allowed and men are urged to shave daily.
The proposed new code is much less specific -- 163 words in all. It states that men's hairstyles should be clean and neat; beards and mustaches, if worn, must be neatly trimmed; "grubby" clothing, like sweatpants or ripped jeans, may be worn in living areas and informal outdoor activities but may not be worn to "school activities," including athletic events.
Students are admonished, in the proposed code as in the old one, not to wear shorts or skirts above the knee, and encouraged to wear clothes "modest in fabric, fit and style."
 
 Separating the Codes

The Student Advisory Council, which includes representatives from all the colleges in the university, has also proposed separating the dress standards from the honor code.
The president of the council, Brett Blake, a senior in public relations from Ogden, said the main points of the honor code, like academic honesty and integrity, are being overshadowed by the attention paid to the dress code.
Rob Daines, a former student body president who is now a law student at Yale University, said that proposals to revise the dress code have been made year after year, and to his mind remain unlikely to succeed. He said the grooming code "drew attention to things like wearing socks and away from building a different kind of university."
Shannon Dickman, a junior in international relations from Orlando, Fla., said: "I don't think whether or not someone has to wear socks makes a difference in the attitude and atmosphere here,"
"After all," she said, "Brigham Young had a beard, didn't he?"
 
 'Wouldn't Hold My Breath'
 Kristin Smith, the chairwoman of the student committee that drafted the proposal, said she feels that changes will be made in the code eventually. But the sophomore from Batesville, Ind., majoring in political science and economics, admitted, "I wouldn't hold my breath that it will go through as it is now."
The Honor Code Review Committee will send both the student proposal and its own recommendation on to the university administrators who make up the President's Council.
R. J. Snow, the university's vice president for student life, who is chairman of the review committee, said that it is unlikely that its proposal would be as unrestrictive as that of the students. He said that beards -- even the "neatly trimmed" ones the students are proposing -- would probably not be permitted.
The Church takes great pride in the university, said Mr. Snow, and wants the emphasis on campus to remain on education.
Also, he said, the school has many visitors, and the Church wants it to be a place "where people can visit and feel good about what they see."

HEADLINE: Camera

BYLINE: By Andy Grundberg

 BODY:
What a difference a year makes. Last year, I went to the I. M. Pei-designed convention center in New York City to visit the exhibits at the Photo 89 show and found the halls darkened by an electrical failure. Such glitches drove the exhibitors nearly batty. They were mostly manufacturers of pro gear, although the big guns like Kodak and Nikon were in attendance as well.
This year's version, Photo 90, went off with nary a power surge -- especially good news for those showing the latest in computerized, electronic image making. The exhibitors were pleased and so were the more than 10,000 visitors. The annual event, which has a West Coast counterpart each spring in San Francisco, has become a mecca for photographers eager to see and hold the latest high-tech, expensive camera gear. 
 While most manufacturers introduce their latest at the every-other-year Photokina trade fair in Cologne, Germany, or at the PMA (Photographic Manufacturers Association) show held every winter in the United States, some new products emerged at the Photo show. Many were geared to really serious photographers, like new power packs for studio electronic flash set-ups. But a few reached into the thicker part of the photography market.
Ilford, a British company that owns the Swiss-developed Cibachrome process and is in turn owned by the International Paper Company, has a brand-new batch of black-and-white and color products in the pipeline. Some of the most innovative films won't be announced until February, but a few rolls were handed out for testing purposes. As soon as I've tried them, I'll supply the details.
What can be told now is that Ilford's HP5 Plus, a 400-speed, black-and-white film that has a remarkable developing latitude, is newly available in roll- and sheet-film sizes. That may not mean anything to 35-millimeter users, who have been shooting the film for a year, but the expansion of the line gives pros and serious amateurs new options at a time when black-and-white is hot stuff in advertising and editorial contexts.
Other Ilford good news included a new Cibachrome processing system, P-3X, which is both more efficient and more catholic. Processing times are cut by about a third from the old P-3 system (12 minutes versus 18), and the chemicals serve equally well for Cibachrome prints and display transparencies. Its advantages are aimed more at machine processors than at lowly processing drums, however.
Since Cibachrome prints are known to be expensive, Ilford has come up with a low-cost alternative, Ilford Color Rapid. It has a very brief, 2 1/2 minute wet time, which makes it economical for large-volume processors. Let's hope the savings get passed on to the customer!
At Agfa, the news was a high-speed black-and-white printing paper. Called Multicontrast High Speed (they took the words right out of my mouth), the enlarging paper is claimed to require half as long exposures compared to the others.
Remember Contax? That's the low-profile camera that Yashica rescued from oblivion in the 1970's and established as its luxury line, kind of like what Lexus is to Toyota. Now there's a Contax RTS III, an updated version of the classic RTS. Its most notable feature, in this day and age, is manual focusing. Since the lenses are made by Carl Zeiss in Germany, that's not necessarily a disadvantage.
Those enamored of auto focusing, however, might want to check out Minolta's special-edition Maxxum 8000i, which has a reflective white finish. Because it will stay cooler than the standard black-finish model, it would be ideal for taking pictures in, say, Saudi Arabia.
Sunpak, a leading flash maker, has a nifty new add-on ringlight called the DX-12R. Built to fit over lenses with filter sizes of from 49 to 72 millimeters, the ringlight provides ideal illumination for close-ups and a wild "halo" look for portraits. The round flash tube unit plugs into a hot-shoe mounted power source, which resembles a standard on-camera flash.
Mamiya took the occasion to uncover its new version of its venerable RB67, a roll-film camera much used by pros. The new name is the Mamiya RB67 Professional SD, but as far as I know amateurs are allowed to buy it if they can find the cash. The camera has a new lens mount that goes with a brace of new high-speed Mamiya lenses.
Finally, I spied Beseler's new version of its 8-by-10-inch enlarger, which has an improved cold-light source. Okay, so 8-by-10 enlargers aren't typical amateur fare -- especially since most of them are the size of a fork-lift truck, and just as heavy. But Beseler's svelte model, which I used last summer in its earlier, more primitive form, can actually fit in an average home darkroom. This makes me want one, if only to be able to enlarge a whole roll of 36-millimeter film with one exposure.

After 15 Years, Washington Looks to Moscow's Hunger
 
The question is, will Western aid for the Soviet Union furnish a down payment on economic progress, or a drunken, delirious banquet likely to end in deeper despair? Russian citizens and American scholars wonder. President Bush last week approved $1 billion in Federal credits for the Soviet Union, lifting a 15-year ban on such aid with the goal of easing Soviet food shortages. The United States rejected European calls for full Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, saying the Soviets should receive only Special Association status pending further economic reforms. Many Soviets feel the kindest deed they can do for foreigners bringing money and supplies is to warn that their fellow Russians are cheats, profiteers and thieves. Using the K.G.B. to police food distribution is hardly reassuring. The K.G.B. officer trying to sell his high-crested hat to tourists one day is unlikely to to keep his hands off Western goodies the next.
 
Dyed-in-the-Wood Gorbachev
 
Under the skin, deep inside, is Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev really another Brezhnev? A Khrushchev? A Stalin, or Lenin, perhaps? Moscow souvenir-hunters can count up the implications of the nesting wooden dolls of Soviet leaders sold along the Arbat, the pedestrian mall. They are a 1990's version of the traditional matrushka dolls, which, in Brezhnev's and Stalin's times, invariably depicted maidens, soldiers and other politically safe subjects. The doll vendors are evidently taking advantage of Mr. Gorbachev's encouragement of free markets, hawking Gorby dolls for $20 (hundreds of rubles).

Mexico's Telephone Sale
 
For many Mexicans, a long-distance or international call means a trip to the Telmex office, an hour's wait and charges equal to a day's salary. Last week, the Mexican Government said it would sell Telefonos de Mexico for $1.76 billion to a group that has agreed to bring a donkey-and-cart system into the airline era. The sale, to Grupo Carso of Mexico, the Southwestern Bell Corporation and France Telecom is the latest sign of the country's willingness to accept American investment, according to Sidney Weintraub, a professor at the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. He added that the United States is meanwhile becoming more hesitant about the free flow of goods and money across its southern border. "I find that role-reversal ironic," he said.
 
Post-Hammer Occidental
 
Maybe Armand Hammer kept going for all those years partly to frustrate the traders who always bid up Occidental Petroleum on rumors of his demise. He died on Monday at the age of 92, the day before his planned bar mitzvah. The stock jumped 1 7/8 to 22 5/8 on Tuesday. Dr. Hammer was long the Soviet Union's favorite capitalist; tour guides at the Lenin Museum in Moscow point out the small statue, a gift from Dr. Hammer, that still sits on Lenin's desk. At Occidental, Dr. Hammer ran his own command economy, purging top aides and spending company funds on an art museum to house his collection, no matter what other stockholders said. Analysts expect Dr. Hammer's patient successor, Ray R. Irani, to introduce perestroika, possibly selling the company's 51 percent interest in IBP Inc., a major meat packer, as well as coal and natural gas operations, to concentrate on chemicals and oil.
 
In Brief
 
Eastern Airlines might still be falsifying its maintenance records, according to a court document released last week. Eastern and several employees were indicted by a Federal grand jury in July on charges of falsely recording repairs.
 
The strong German mark, it would seem, buys more in the United States. The largest German utility, RWE A.G., agreed on Thursday to pay $590 million for the Vista Chemical Company. The offer, $55 a share, was more than double the previous day's closing price of $25.

 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Spreading Recession
 
The worst monthly decline in industrial production since 1982 confirmed the views of many economists that the current recession is unlikely to be mild. Output fell 1.7 percent last month, with automobile production especally weak. "Almost every sector is declining now," said Lawrence Krohn, an economist at Shearson Lehman. He expects production declines to moderate but continue for several months. Not to worry about November's five-tenths of 1 percent rise in producer prices, he added. "Anyone who looks for an acceleration of inflation given this depressed environment will be mistaken," he said.
 
New England Bailout
 
The Bush Administration placed more than $1 billion in Treasury deposits in the ailing Bank of New England this year just as worried depositors were withdrawing billions. Treasury officials denied that the bank had receieved special aid. But the Senate Banking Committee and the General Accounting Office have opened their own inquiries.
 
Retail sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in November -- no surprise to the store managers who are resorting to pre-Christmas sales.
 
 
COMPANIES


CBS Dumps the Cash
 
The implosion of CBS Inc. continues. It was a premier television network with record and magazine businesses besides; then, a network with a huge pile of cash; soon, just a network with lagging profits and a smaller pile of cash. CBS offered on Thursday to buy back about 44 percent of its stock for $190 a share, using about two-thirds of its $3 billion in cash. The immediate cause was the need for the heirs of William S. Paley, the company's founder, to pay estate taxes. But some analysts said the company's president, Laurence A. Tisch, could find no better use for the cash. Or maybe, some said, Larry the Liquidator wants to trim the company down so it can be acquired in one easily digested bite. Mr. Tisch was greeted as a white knight when he invested in CBS in 1986. Now, some there question his colors.
 
Equitable Passes the Hat
 
That man in front of a midtown Manhattan skyscraper ringing a bell and seeking contributions might be from the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. The needy insurance company announced last week that it plans to raise about $500 million by offering stock to the public. Like most other major life insurers, Equitable has been a mutual company, owned by its policyholders. Losses on "junk bonds" and real estate have forced the company to raise capital. Analysts expect other impoverished insurers to follow Equitable's examples.
 
Power Over Cable?
 
Communities would have more power to limit the cost of cable television service under new rules the Federal Communications Commission proposed last week. The measures could be enacted as early as the spring.
 
An Animated Separation
 
Call off the caterers. Cancel the hall. Mickey Mouse and Miss Piggie have broken off their engagement because their families just can't get along. The Walt Disney Company said on Thursday that it has abandoned its planned acquisition of Henson Associates Inc. and its Muppets. After Jim Henson, the Muppets' creator, died in May, some industry executives say, his five children became rather piggy themselves, refusing to reduce their $100 million-plus asking price. Disney maintained that buying Henson Associates without Henson was like buying Kermit the Tadpole.
 
Kerkorian Targets Chrysler
 
With the Chrysler Corporation smelling like carrion in the desert, sooner or later a vulture was bound to appear. On Friday, Kirk Kerkorian, the takeover artist who rules his own arid kingdom of Las Vegas casinos and hotels, emerged as the owner of 9.8 percent of Chrysler's shares, which cost him $277 million. The Chrysler board did its best on Friday to make the company unappetizing, offering to sell new shares at less than market value if anyone acquires more than 10 percent of its stock. Some analysts say Chrysler is so weak that, to avoid falling prey to an enemy, it needs to sell out to a wealthy, protective friend.
 
NCR Spurns A.T.&T.
 
NCR and A.T.& T. are taking their public battle to the stockholders. The NCR Corporation board unanimously rejected a $90-a-share buyout offer last week from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. NCR chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. plans to visit major institutional investors so as to urge them to keep their stock out of A.T.& T.'s hands. The telephone company, for its part, has threatened a proxy fight against the NCR board.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Consumer Driven? Not This Economy

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
In one more sign that the hard times are
a-changin', the number of new households being formed in the United States had fallen to near-Depression levels before the weaker economy became apparent, reports Richard F. Hokenson, a demographer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Fewer new households, of course, is ominous for housing and consumer-goods industries.
One reason for the drop is the declining number of marriages. Another is that more young men are living at home. "I hope this is not a permanent trend," Mr. Hokenson said of the latter, "and I know their parents hope so, as well. But even if it were to reverse -- and it actually shows signs of growing -- it's a very protracted reversal process." 
 And, packing "a real negative whammy," Mr. Hokenson said, the number of people turning 25 is dropping. "That means much slower growth in the labor force, and workers translate into consumers. To call our economy 'consumer driven' may have been accurate in the past; it is an inaccurate depiction of our future."

HEADLINE: The Art Boom: Is It Over, or Is This Just a Correction?

BYLINE: By PETER C.T. ELSWORTH

 BODY:
The biggest art boom in history may be over, but the market still has a long way to tumble to reach the levels of just two to three years ago.
The growth of the art market through the 1980's reflected a money-obsessed decade when billionaires replaced millionaires in business magazine pantheons. There seemed to be no limits. Prices went ever higher and the boom offered the once-unimaginable prospect of a $100 million painting. It nearly came to pass. 
 But then the economy slowed. The weak results from the fall auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York and London indicate the once white-hot market for Impressionist, modern and contemporary art has cooled. About 20 percent of the Impressionist and modern works failed to sell in New York, and no more than 50 percent of the contemporary works moved.
Still, said Amy Page, editor of Art and Auction magazine, "People are saying we've gone back to 1988 prices, but that's still extremely high, that's not a crash."
"What has crashed in the art market is all the speculation," added Milton Esterow, publisher and editor of ARTnews magazine. "This is very healthy. All the folks who were in the market for a fast buck are out and some of them have gotten burnt."
The sales also offered a few pockets of strength. At Christie's, for example, a van Gogh drawing set a record by selling for $8.4 million, well above the estimate of $5 million to $7 million. But earlier the same evening, one of his paintings, expected to sell for $12 million to $16 million, failed to find a bid higher than $9 million.
Only last May, in the same auction room, a Japanese buyer, who was reportedly prepared to go as high as $100 million, paid a record $82.5 million for the artist's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet."
Even the contemporary market held up in places. "Summer" by Philip Guston sold for $1.1 million, a record for the artist, and de Kooning's "July" sold for $8.8 million, well above its estimate. But a number of works by some of the best-known artists to have emerged in the 1980's -- Eric Fischl and Julian Schnabel, for example -- as well as Pop icon Andy Warhol, failed to find buyers.
Despite continued firmness in a number of other art markets, Latin American among them, the current slump may continue. Christopher Burge, president of Christie's North America, sees a period of consolidation following what he called the buildup of "unsustainable" values led by Impressionist paintings. He noted auction sale results tend to dip every seven years or so.
"It's a much-needed correction," said Ms. Page. "Art is not a liquid investment. You can't turn it over every six months."
The question is how long the correction will run.
"If the economy had continued, the art market would still have corrected itself to a degree," said Paula Cooper, a dealer in SoHo. "A lot of people thought this was coming a lot earlier than it did. I think the next season will be shocking to people. They're going to have to adjust to a new market."
Sotheby's, the world's largest auction house, said last week it was planning a restructuring that will involve laying off about 6 percent of its staff worldwide.
The 1980's art boom was fueled by the flow of new money on Wall Street, the strong Japanese yen and aggressive marketing by the auction houses. In the late 1980's, prices for late-19th- and 20th-century paintings soared above other categories such as Old Masters or English silver. Art, always a speculative venture, constituted the best return on investment for some during the 80's -- provided it sold at all. (Average returns on collectibles do not generally refelect items offered at action but withdrawn if the bid is not high enough.)
The art auctions constitute a secondary market, often dominated by speculators, as opposed to the primary market of artists, galleries and collectors, where, some dealers say, prices are holding up. They add that they are happy to see fewer calculator-toting buyers.
"A person buying to speculate tends not to have an emotional involvement with art," said Mary Boone, another SoHo dealer. Even those who have ridden the 1980's boom welcome the change because art lovers never like to see works reduced to mere commodities.
"It's the people who were in it for investment only who have dropped out," said one dealer, who goes by the name Gracie Mansion. In the mid-1980's, she was at the center of a vibrant art scene which developed in New York's East Village when more than 50 storefront galleries dotted the area. Hardly any remain.
"I've been very lucky," she said, looking around her spacious new gallery in SoHo. But perhaps it wasn't just luck. Perhaps it had to do with looking beyond the dollar value of art.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
As the Banks Ebb, Will the Market Follow?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Bank stocks led the stock market up in the rally that started in October. But now, the banks are starting to fade, and it is possible they will lead the market right back down again.
The state of the banks has worried investors for many reasons. No one can recall the beginning of a recession when the financial system appeared to be in shakier condition. The banks are being damaged by falling asset prices, which continue to drop in part because the banks won't lend money to would-be buyers.
Now, the attention is shifting to Washington, where William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, again raised his estimate of the deposit insurance fund's losses for this year, to $4 billion. A few months ago, they were supposed to be half that.
Tomorrow, a hearing of the House banking committee on the state of the fund is expected to produce more glum estimates, and soon the pressure will be on to make the healthy banks pay. "An outstanding bank like J. P. Morgan would, in an economic sense, effectively face ongoing exposure to New England real estate risk if it were forced through deposit insurance premiums to pay" a share of other banks' losses, warned Eric Hemel, a bank analyst at First Boston, in removing most of his buy recommendations from bank stocks.
The bank stock rally that began on Sept. 28 was a powerful one, albeit from a depressed base. By Dec. 5, Morgan was up almost 50 percent, and the average New York bank added 25 percent. But since then, the average bank has lost 11 percent, while Morgan, still outperforming, is off just 7 percent.
The banks were particularly weak on Friday, as the Dow Jones industrial average lost 20.55 points, leaving it up 3.71 points for the week, to 2,593.81.
When the banks were moving up, one reason was the widespread perception that interest rates were headed down, as the Fed eased. But rates backed up a bit at the end of last week, as Government reports indicated that retail sales and inflation were both stronger than expected in November. That could make the Fed hesitate.
A survey of institutional investors by Richard Hoey, the chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, showed more bullishness on bonds in late November than ever before, breaking the record set a year earlier, just before rates surprised almost everyone by rising. Mr. Hoey expects a repeat, and the dip in interest-sensitive utility stocks reinforces that forecast.
The Fed also is beginning to appear isolated internationally. The outlook in both Japan and Germany seems to be for tighter monetary policy, and Germany now effectively runs Europe. Gilles Halna du Fretay, the president of HDF, a French money management firm, noted last week that while the French economy may need lower interest rates, it won't get them unless Deutsche Bundesbank reverses course.
The danger is that American interest rates will have to rise to attract foreign capital. If so, that is bad news for the banks, and for the economy.

HEADLINE: Running on Fast-Forward in Budapest

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
As an anti-Communist youth, George Varga fled Hungary in 1956 to avoid arrest by the Soviet forces that crushed his homeland's rebellion.
This year, with Communism crumbling, he returned as president of the biggest American joint venture in Eastern Europe: the General Electric Company's bold $200 million effort to revive the Tungsram Company, Hungary's largest maker of light bulbs. 
 Once one of the world's premier light-bulb producers, Tungsram slipped badly under Communism, and Mr. Varga now sees his mission in life as resurrecting the company and making it a beacon for Hungary's 2,000 other state-owned enterprises.
"It feels like a calling," he said, his brown eyes sparkling. "We want to take this country, this company, and put it in fast-forward."
To succeed, he will have to push a lot of buttons all at once -- to improve Tungsram's work ethic, to add modern bulbs to its aging product line, to slash the number of bulbs shattered on the assembly line, to install modern computers and teach people to use them.
Mr. Varga and General Electric are under a lot of pressure to make this experiment work -- it is one of the most closely watched "joint adventures," as they are sometimes called, in Eastern Europe. American companies want to see if giant G.E. can pull it off before they decide whether to take the plunge into Eastern Europe; Hungarians want to see whether America's vaunted capitalist magic can make Tungsram gleam again.
"There are a lot of people watching on both sides," said Mr. Varga, whose elegant gray suit and Milan-modern black leather furniture seem out of place among the smokestacks and industrial din of northern Budapest. G.E.'s investment in Tungsram is the most visible of more than 100 American projects in Hungary, which can boast more American investment than any other Eastern European country. Thanks to its open economy, tax breaks and liberal joint-venture laws, Hungary has also attracted General Motors, Ford, Kodak, Digital Equipment and Levi Strauss.
Turning around Tungsram will not be a cut-and-dried business-school exercise, but a protracted process requiring sacrifice, sensitivity and ingenuity. Tungsram's bloated work force picked up many bad habits under Communism, and many workers are not rushing to embrace Western ways. Its computer system was so backward that when G.E. took over last January, Tungsram tallied its profit and cash flow once every six months, not once a month as G.E. expects.
 
Bumps and Bruises
 What is more, G.E. has come on the scene as Hungary, like the rest of Eastern Europe, is struggling with a stormy situation that is growing stormier by the day: rapid inflation, disarray in the Soviet economy and bumps and bruises from moving toward the free market.
Mr. Varga, a trim, 54-year-old with straight, light brown hair, has to walk a fine line in leading Tungsram out of its difficulties. He is seeking to slash Tungsram's work force while managing somehow to improve employee attitudes. And he is trying to teach Hungarians how to take responsibility after they spent 40 years either shunning it or being shorn of it.
"The most difficult part is the human software," he said. "New ideas were discouraged, there was very little initiative and zero sense of ownership. Attitudes will be the most difficult thing to change. It's not a problem you can just throw money at." Mr. Varga's solution: making his workers feel that Hungarian ways are still appreciated even as he introduces Western ways. This means that he and other G.E. executives, often considered an arrogant, hard-charging bunch, have to be more considerate, more touchy-feely than usual.
"We have to worry about a lot of tender sores," said Mr. Varga. "Some people worry the Americans are trying to colonize. Making this company American overnight will not work."
 
A New Global Fit
 Eastern Europe was long a blank spot on the map of Western executives like G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr., who have ambitions to span the globe. When Communism's momentous collapse began last year, however, G.E. executives warmed up to the region and concluded that Tungsram would fit neatly into their global strategy.
Underlining just how much business's attitude has changed toward Eastern Europe, G.E.'s lighting executives now view Tungsram as key to their European plans. G.E., the world's No. 2 light-bulb maker behind Philips N.V. of the Netherlands, long had just 2 percent of the West European market. That made its $2.3 billion lighting business a distant sixth in that dynamic region.
"It was imperative for us to compete from a much stronger position in Europe," said John D. Opie, a G.E. senior vice president and head of its lighting business. "In order to do that, we needed a European product line, some European manufacturing capacity and an organization that understood the European market."
Tungsram fit the bill. Despite all its flaws, the company, with 7 percent of the Western European market, was a jewel by Soviet bloc standards, exporting an impressive 70 percent of its production to hard-currency countries. Indeed, Mercedes-Benz was so pleased with Tungsram's lights that even this most exacting of auto makers bought them for its cars. Tungsram also gave G.E. a strong position in the promising Eastern European market and a well-educated work force whose wages average $40 a week, one-tenth of what G.E.'s American workers earn. So in November 1989, G.E. agreed to pay $150 million to obtain 50.1 percent of the company.
Now, a year later, G.E. has decided to build on the Tungsram purchase by forming a joint light-bulb manufacturing and distribution company in Britain with Thorn EMI P.L.C. In addition, G.E. is buying Thorn's light-bulb manufacturing activities in the rest of Europe. The deal, announced last month, cost G.E. $138 million and doubles its market share in Western Europe, to 18 percent. That raises its Western European rank to No. 3.
Once G.E. took control of Tungsram, it seemed that every top manager save one knew who was the obvious choice to head the company.
"I was stunned when I got the call," said Mr. Varga, whose previous job was heading a $500 million-a-year G.E. plastics plant in the Netherlands. "The idea was in everybody's mind but mine."
For the man born Gyorgy Varga, it has been a long road back to Budapest. A star soccer player as a youth, he fled to Vienna at the age of 20 after opposing the Soviet invasion, leaving behind his parents, two brothers and two sisters. He felt blessed when he obtained a visa for the United States, and he moved to a refugee camp in New Jersey. There, a minister from Maryland offered to take young Gyorgy and 20 other refugees to Westminster, Md., promising to look after them. On the bus to Maryland, Gyorgy met Judith Szabo, also a Hungarian refugee and the woman he would marry.
Mr. Varga went to Western Maryland College, where he became an all-American soccer player, once scoring 11 goals in a game. Notwithstanding his beginner's English, he did so well in college that he won a scholarship to get a master's in economics at Stanford University. He then joined General Electric, where he has been for 28 years with stints in Spain, Mexico and Switzerland.
 
The Perfect Place
 "Sometimes I feel I spent the past 34 years learning English, going to college, moving ahead at G.E., just to prepare for this job," Mr. Varga said. "I could not wish for anything more perfect than this."
He relishes telling how the Karl Marx School of Economics in Budapest invited him to give an address some 35 years after it rejected him as a student simply because his father was a businessman, not a proletarian. (Mr. Varga's father, who owned a small furniture-making company, died in 1975. His mother still lives here.)
Nowadays, Mr. Varga often ambles over in his soccer player's walk to meet with workers in Tungsram's rundown, turn-of-the-century plant here.
"The most common question workers ask is, 'Is this company going to succeed?' " he said. " 'It's not just my job,' I tell them. 'It's going to be all right, but you're all responsible for making this happen.' "
Central to his efforts is increasing productivity at Tungsram, which had 18,000 employees when he arrived in February. G.E.'s lighting business has the same number of workers, but seven times the sales. Tungsram reported profits of $22 million last year on sales of $300 million, but G.E. reckons that under standard Western accounting methods, earnings were just $9 million.
Mr. Varga has already reduced employment to 15,000, and he is aiming for 13,000 next year. He is doing this mostly through early retirements, attrition and a hiring freeze. However, he is laying off 400 white-collar workers in an overhaul of Tungsram's administration. During the top-heavy Communist era, Tungsram had 11 layers of management in some areas. Overall, there was one white-collar worker for each 2.5 factory workers, compared with a ratio of 1-to-7 at many Western companies. One example of swollen bureaucracy: a purchase order required 24 signatures with a copy going to each person.
 
A Touchy Issue
 Mr. Varga has avoided clashes over the job cuts by working with Tungsram's union. "We acknowledge that to increase productivity, some strict, unpopular measures must be taken, such as reducing the work force," said Gyorgy Selmeczy, head of the union local. Wages are a touchy issue, however, with the union demanding across-the-board raises of about 45 percent (Hungary's inflation rate is 37 percent).
G.E. is telling employees that, although there will be fewer of them and they will work harder, those who remain will earn more. In a singularly un-Communistic move, it has instituted a merit raise system in which some workers receive no increases and others get up to 40 percent.
"It's getting people to recognize that individual performance will be rewarded, and poor performance will not," said James R. Cunheady, Tungsram's vice president for manpower development. "The good performers seem to resent the poor performers' getting the same pay."
In many ways, Tungsram is a microcosm of the region's need for change and its ambivalence toward change. Some workers are disappointed that Tungsram has not already been transformed into a 21st-century enterprise with robotized production and Western pay scales. "I haven't felt any changes yet," said Mihaly Keresztesi, a 27-year-old worker helping assemble headlights. "We thought things would have gotten better already.
But other workers protest that G.E. is pushing too hard to change their petrified work patterns. "We work a lot harder, but we don't get a lot more money for it, and we don't know what's going to happen to our jobs," said 31-year-old Gyongyi Dancs, as she hunched over a microscope. She said she now has to inspect 3,600 headlight filaments a day, up from 2,700 in the pre-G.E. days.
This mixed message is echoing throughout Eastern Europe, as some people say reforms are coming too fast and causing too much pain, while others urge far-faster reform to leave Communism's dreariness behind all the sooner.
G.E. got a different kind of mixed message from Tungsram itself.
When G.E. sent a team of manufacturing experts to Budapest, they were pleasantly surprised. Tungsram had more expertise in the chemistry of tungsten filaments than G.E. did. Tungsram also had some modern computer-controlled Japanese equipment, even though the Hungarian Government took more than 80 percent of the company's profits and nearly starved it of investment funds.
Another plus was that Tungsram was the world's lowest-cost producer of high-quality incandescent bulbs and paid far more attention to quality than did most Communist enterprises.
"Tungsram sold a lot to the West, and they learned their lessons from customers saying, 'Take it back. We're not going to accept defects,' " said Kevin Gallimore, Tungsram's new vice president for manufacturing.
 
Unpleasant Surprises
 But there have been some unpleasant surprises as well. A halogen bulb factory lost an astonishing 70 percent of potential production because of defects, breakage and machine breakdowns. G.E. engineers reduced those losses to 30 percent by, for example, adjusting glass-making temperatures, bulb thickness and pressure inside the bulbs. That compares with 20 percent losses at Western halogen bulb factories.
Another jolt: Tungsram often didn't test its bulbs until a week after they were made. This meant not only unpacking and repacking bulbs, but also often discovering that a week's worth of bulbs were defective. G.E. is installing quality-control equipment that tests the bulbs as they are made.
To modernize and expand production, G.E. plans to invest a total of $60 million this year and next. It is installing equipment to update Tungsram's product array to include compact fluorescent bulbs and high-pressure sodium bulbs for street lamps.
Although Hungary has liberal laws allowing the repatriation of profits, Mr. Varga says G.E. plans to reinvest almost all its Tungsram earnings for several more years. He expects just a few million dollars in profits this year because of restructuring costs, soaring oil prices, high inflation and a 20 percent drop in sales to recession-plagued Eastern Europe.
For the 10 Americans G.E. has sent to Hungary, the biggest surprise of all has been the difficulties caused by the language barrier. That barrier is far more burdensome than in Western Europe where the languages are more familiar to American executives and more local people speak English. G.E. executives complain that time is wasted when everything needs to be translated and that important subtleties often get lost in translation.
"We are working at the same effort level as in the U.S., yet we accomplish just 25 percent of what we do there," said Mr. Gallimore, the head of manufacturing.
For their part, some Hungarians bitterly complain that less talented Hungarians who speak English well are being promoted over more talented Hungarians with weak English.
Despite these tensions, everyone is thankful that there is a Hungarian-American at the helm. This wayward son of the Communist era has become a favorite son in the post-Communist era.
"I don't think you could do this job if you didn't speak Hungarian," Mr. Varga said. "So much of this is an attempt to marry two cultures, to make people live together, that you need someone who is equally comfortable in both languages."
 
 
SOME TRICKS OF THE HUNGARIAN TRADE

So your company is thinking of investing in Hungary? Well, don't set up shop until you have done your homework.
 Eastern Europe is not a place for quick killings, American executives in Hungary warn, although service companies like accounting firms can drum up a lot of business quickly.
"You have to be patient here," said Steven M. Bina, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hungary and co-director of Schwinn Bicycle's joint venture in Budapest. "It's a long-term investment that has the potental to pay off very handsomely 5, 10 years down the road."
Theodore S. Boone, a Budapest-based attorney with Baker & McKenzie, warns that potential investors in Hungarian companies have sometimes had problems just identifying who can sell them a stake.
Although most companies are state-owned, sometimes ministries control them, sometimes workers councils do and sometimes management boards do. "Be very sure you're negotiating with the correct party," Mr. Boone said.
What's more, he said, it would be naive to think that all an investor has to do is plop down some cash for a joint venture to succeed. "You also have to bring in management expertise and technology," he said.
Before the General Electric Company acquired a majority stake in Tungsram, Hungary's premier light-bulb producer, it worked hard to control the risks.
G.E. won guarantees from the state that it would have the same freedom to make management decisions, like layoffs, as it has in the West. Fearing that the Government might, for example, force it to pay twice as much for oil as Hungarian companies, it also won guarantees that it would not be treated worse than domestic companies.
"We're talking about investing a large sum of money in a country where no one was sure what would happen," said William Woodburn, managing director of G.E.'s European lighting operations and the company's new worldwide vice president for marketing. "We were able to mitigate a lot of the risk associated with the business operations."
But there are other risks, largely beyond control. Hungary's 37 percent inflation rate this year has hurt the competitiveness of Tungsram's exports. Sales to the old Soviet bloc have slipped after the region's economy plunged into recession for numerous reasons, including higher oil prices, the deterioration of the Soviet economy and the disintegration of Comecon, the Soviet-led trading group.
Despite these risks, Hungarians are still counting on Western investors to help turn their economy around. Andras Pinter, the Hungarian who heads Levi Strauss's jeans-making joint venture, said, "If Hungary gets some good products and good technology, its industry could really do well."

HEADLINE: All About/Dog and Cat Food;
Will the American Pet Go for Haute Cuisine?

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
When is a consumer not a consumer? When the product is pet food and the human buyer is merely the medium by which the pet obtains its grub. On that paradoxical relationship rests the brutal business of feeding the nation's 109 million cats and dogs. Americans spend some $7.5 billion annually to keep their four-pawed pets in chow, more than on any other category of packaged food.
Though profitable, the industry recently has grown only 3 percent to 4 percent annually. Consolidation has reduced the number of producers and put others in jeopardy. In 1982, seven manufacturers held 74 percent of the market; in 1989, the Big Six manufacturers held 84 percent, according to John Maxwell, a food industry analyst with Wheat/First Securities. 
 "There's no doubt this is a mature industry," said Douglas Mills, president of the diversified grocery product division at the Quaker Oats Company in Chicago. The problem for the Big Six food companies -- Ralston-Purina, Carnation, Quaker, Heinz, Mars and Alpo -- is that consumers are increasingly likely to buy either in expensive specialty pet shops or in discount houses like Wal-Mart. "The volume of pet food sales is shifting away from supermarkets," Mr. Mills said.
But an industry that monitors every twitch of consumer behavior has begun to detect its next big opening. The heightened human awareness of nutrition and fitness is changing the diets of cats and dogs.
"People are feeding their pets like they feed their children. The nutrition kick has moved over to our pets," said John McMillin, who follows the food industry for Prudential-Bache Securities. The marketing of pet food and the marketing of human food are converging as companies try to persuade pet-loving, health-conscious consumers to pay from a third more to twice as much for a can or bag of food.
In the brawling tradition of food producers, the Big Six are still slugging it out with expensive introductions of new pet-food products. Alpo, owned by Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., the British conglomerate, rolled out its first cat food last year. But to insure profitability and margins that are typically 8 percent to 10 percent, but sometimes as high as 25 percent, the companies must also search for new turf.
Thus, the 16 percent of the market not dominated by the major producers beckons. This field was long conceded to small, so-called "premium" pet-food companies, like Hill's Pet Products and the Iams Company.
Mr. McMillin estimates that this niche is worth as much as $1 billion, with 20 percent annual growth in recent years. Even smaller, entrepreneurial outfits like Lick Your Chops, which uses organic ingredients, are attracting more customers. For the moment, the tiny tail of the industry is wagging the corporate dog.
 
Marketing Is Key
Consumers Show Scant Brand Loyalty
In pet food, the wise producer rarely sleeps. The Ralston-Purina Company, the St. Louis feed giant, has remained the industry leader for several years by regularly trotting out new products to keep its lines fresh. Perhaps because consumers sense what animal nutritionists know -- that the major brands of pet food are almost equally nutritious -- there is little brand loyalty.
That makes sales a matter of marketing, and a big company may spend millions on coupons and advertising to promote a new product. The ads generally work by giving human attributes to pets, often presenting them conversing with humans or expressing their own willful little personalities.
"We know that most pet owners talk to their pets," said John Goodchild, chairman of the Weightman Group in Philadelphia, which produces advertising for Alpo and choreographed marketing in the $70 million debut of Alpo's new cat food. "The emotional bond between owner and pet is extremely powerful. We try to evoke that or show that we understand."
Alpo says its premium cat food, introduced with the help of Garfield the cartoon cat, is the most successful new pet food in years. The company says the product has added $126 million in sales for Grand Metroplitan, which earlier this year tried to sell Alpo but could not.
The industry is skeptical of Alpo's claims. Competitors and analysts say the cat food's initial success has depended on promotions and discounts that Alpo will be unable to sustain over the long haul. "We'll see how much share Alpo has once they stop the promotions," said Mr. McMillin of Prudential-Bache.
The industry does agree that Alpo forced everyone to spend more money on marketing. "Everyone got hurt by their aggressiveness," Mr. McMillin said.
 
The Big Six
All Are Jostling For Premium Niche
 The supermarket frays are likely to continue as the Big Six muscle into premium food. In the last four years, virtually every major producer has jumped into the upper bracket. The acronym-driven Ralston-Purina has launched Pro-Plan, O.N.E. (for Optimum Nutrient Effectiveness) and, at the end of this year, a reformulation of Pro-Plan, Pro-Plan CMN (for Clinical Nutrition Management). Heinz's Nine Lives, the leading canned cat food, is now available as "Lean Entree" for the full-figured tabby. Quaker Oats is reformulating Cycle dog food for delivery early next year, to be sold in supermarket "nutrition centers," which will offer guidance on choosing Cycle products appropriate for a pet's age.
If it sounds like the new pet foods will require owners manuals, blame Hill's Pet Products, bought by the Colgate-Palmolive Company in 1975, and Iams, an independent based in Dayton, Ohio. Until recently, the two companies have had the premium territory almost to themselves.
Hill's grew more than tenfold in the 1980's, to an estimated $470 million in sales last year. The company began making dog food in 1948, then expanded by developing a network of veterinarians who used its Prescription Diet to help manage ailments like feline urological syndrome, and heart disease and obesity in both dogs and cats. In the early 1960's, Hill's began to sell the Science Diet, originally formulated for dogs involved in medical research who needed a nutritious, consistent diet. Hill's continues to sell both products through veterinarians, but has also moved Science Diet into specialty pet stores, where it often shares shelf space with Iams, its smaller rival.
Neither company admits to being worried by the unabashed copy-cat strategy of the Big Six. Some larger producers have adopted the names of the Hill's "Senior," "Performance" and "Maintenance" lines. "It discourages me that other companies don't have the ingenuity to come up with their own product names," said David Geier, vice president of marketing and communications at Hill's.
 
Specialty Boutiques
From Nut Brittle To Kitty Pasta
 Anyone passing by at a shop-til-you-drop pace would be forgiven for mistaking the Lick Your Chops pet shops on Manhattan's Upper East Side for one of the neighborhood's many human boutiques and gourmet food stores. The front of the shop is festooned for the holidays and overflowing with ceramic food bowls, leashes and toys.
In the back are the shelves of super-premium pet food -- not only Hill's and Iams, but also Chef Andriu's Chicken 'n Pasta, for cats; Haute Canine, the Natural Gourmet Dog Snack; Dandy Doggy Bowser Brittle, with rain-forest nuts, and Lick Your Chops' own "Junk Food for Cats," which looks a lot like Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers.
Lick Your Chops may never dislodge Ralston-Purina, but the South Norwalk, Conn., company is clearly in the pet-food avant-garde. It is an example of a small entrepreneurial company that found a niche in an industry dominated by wealthy behemoths.
Susan Goldstein, the company president, was selling the ingredients for home-cooked pet foods when, in 1979, she founded Lick Your Chops. Now she has five stores, a line of pet foods, treats and diet supplements and, she says, $4 million in annual sales. She calls her pet food "natural," with organic, pesticide-free ingredients. "It is a lot of work to feed animals consciously," she says of her New Age approach to pet cuisine.
Might consumers be less inclined to pay for organic ingredients if the United States economy continues its free fall? "We might see a drop-off on leashes or bowls, but not on food and supplements," Ms. Goldstein said. "People still want the best for their pets."
 
SORTING OUT NUTRITIONAL CLAIMS
The thought of eating a typical can of pet food may make a human blanch, but according to animal nutritionists, cats and dogs eat very well. "America's dogs and cats eat more healthily than America's children," said Dr. James Corbin, a dog-and-cat-nutrition researcher at the University of Illinois in Urbana.
Pet food typically contains meat byproducts, cereals and grain, which provide protein, minerals, fatty acids, vitamins and energy. "If an animal is eating pet food, all it needs is water to have whole nutrition," Dr. Corbin said.
The industry is heavily scrutinized by state and Federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration.
Pet food makers are sometimes frustrated by labelling regulations. They are not allowed to make health claims without satisfying the clinical standards of the F.D.A. But claims about being low-calorie or "light" are legal -- if they are true. And a pet food maker may not claim its food is especially tasty unless, during a complicated set of feeding trials, several animals actually choose its food.
The industry would like to expand label information, but regulators are skeptical. "Labelling is a marketing tool," said Richard Sellers, the chairman of the Association of American Feed Control Officials Pet Food Committe. "You can list everything that's in a can of food and that still won't tell the consumer anything about what the animal will actually digest." For example, an indigestible byproduct of leather like rawhide, which shows up occasionally in some very inexpensive pet foods, is considered a protein.
There is some difference between the regular and so-called premium -- more expensive -- pet foods the companies are touting: premium food is denser in calories and vitamins and may be easier to digest. "The animal may eat less food and have less stool. It's easier for an apartment dweller to take care of," said Dr. Corbin. "But the difference is really between a Cadillac or a Mercedes and other cars. The superpremiums are more refined," he said. Animal nutritionists say any food from a major producer is nutritionally adequate.
And is "natural" pet food -- made, say, from New Zealand lamb, as one small company has advertised -- healthier than supermarket or pet-shop pet food? "What is a 'natural' product? 'Natural' is a figment of the advertising industry's imagination," said Dr. Bruce Little, the executive vice president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. "Lamb from New Zealand is no better than lamb from Idaho."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
The Year-End Push for Keoghs

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
At the end of the year, there is always a surge in the number of people setting up Keoghs, the retirement plans for the self-employed and for those who work for them. But this year, Fidelity Investments, for one, says it is opening Keoghs at a faster rate than last year. What's fueling the growth? More owners of small businesses are getting into them, particularly since they are one of the few tax shelters left.
Given that, how should people invest their Keogh funds? Most investment advisers recommend putting a big chunk of retirement savings into stock funds, which tend to outperform fixed-rate investments over time. Because most Keoghs are long-term investments, you can afford to be aggressive. But in today's environment, it makes sense to move into the stock market slowly, to limit the impact if the market takes another nosedive. Put the Keogh cash into a money fund and then buy shares in stock funds at regular intervals. 
 What follows are some questions that investors are posing to Fidelity and answers from two retirement experts: Linda Lindbeck, a Fidelity product manager for self-employed retirement plans, and Robert M. Fields, an attorney with the New York law firm Spengler Carlson Gubar Brodsky & Frischling.
Question: How much can I contribute to a Keogh?
Ms. Lindbeck: That depends on which of three variations you choose. In a profit-sharing Keogh, you decide each year whether to contribute and how much; the maximum is 13.04 percent of your net profit, up to $30,000. With a money-purchase Keogh, you must contribute a fixed percentage of earnings each year, up to a maximum of 20 percent, or $30,000. Most people, however, use "paired plans," with features of both. You choose the percentage that you contribute annually to the money-purchase portion, usually 8 percent, and then you can contribute up to 12 percent more to the profit-sharing portion.
Q. When I set up a Keogh, can I make contributions for myself without putting away money for my employees?
Mr. Fields: No. All employees eligible for the plan are entitled to contributions. The amount depends on the plan's guidelines, but employees must benefit comparably with you or you lose the Keogh tax advantages: contributions are tax-deductible and earnings in the account build up tax-free until withdrawals begin. You can deduct contributions that you make for employees.
Q. I hold a full-time job, and I've just set up a consulting business on the side. I'm covered by a retirement plan at work. Can I use a Keogh to shelter part of my business profits?
Ms. Lindbeck: Yes. Employees who own separate businesses generally can contribute part of their business earnings to a Keogh.
Moreover, executives who serve as outside directors on corporate boards usually can fund a Keogh with part of their fees.
Q. What's the deadline for setting up a Keogh?
Ms. Lindbeck: The account must be set up by Dec. 31. Don't worry if you are short of cash -- it's prudent to put a small amount into the account, $100 say, because the maximum amount is not due until your tax return deadline, April 15, or later if you get an extension.
Q. I was recently laid off and I've just started a new business. Can I roll over the money from my previous employer's retirement plan into my new Keogh?
Mr. Fields: For most people, yes. But you cannot roll over money into the Keogh from an Individual Retirement Account to which you contributed; from a 403(b) plan, used by universities and non-profit groups; or from a 457 plan, used by municipalities and government. Keep in mind that rollovers must be completed in 60 days. When you miss the deadline, you owe tax on the money, plus a penalty if you are younger than 59 1/2. And the Internal Revenue Service almost never waives the 60-day deadline.
Q. Do I need a lawyer to set up a Keogh?
Ms. Lindbeck: Not if you choose a "prototype qualified plan," standardized plans, of the three Keogh varieties. These are sufficient for most businesses and mutual funds that sponsor Keoghs can give you the forms.
Q. How much will it cost to set up a Keogh?
Mr. Fields: Mutual funds generally don't charge to open the account. After that, expect to pay a small maintenance fee each year, about $10, but that can rise depending on how many funds you invest in and how many people are covered by the plan. Keep in mind that the annual custodial fees are "miscellaneous expenses" that can be deducted to the extent the total expenses exceed 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. To claim the deduction, you must write separate checks for the Keogh contribution and the expenses, not one to cover both.
 
THE MONEY FUND CASH POT
 Investors poured enough cash into money funds this fall to break the half-trillion-dollar mark, a record. A big chunk of that came from investors who usually keep their cash in bank certificates of deposit, but who decided to move their cash because of their worries over a deteriorating American banking system.
Another large chunk came from stock and bond fund investors, part of the continuing flight to safety that began when the stock market plunged in August and rising oil prices brought the weakness of the American economy into sharper focus.
What happens next? The trend is likely to continue, experts say.
"Cash will probably keep flowing into money funds until the question of war in the Gulf is resolved and the economy settles down," said Martha Wittbrodt, editor of IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a newsletter in Holliston, Mass.

HEADLINE: We'll Sell One Another Ice Cream Cones

 BODY:
To the Editor
You continue to cling editorially to outmoded textbook nonsense about the advantages and blessings of free trade despite a world in which countries protect and promote their own industries and people -- except the United States, that is.
Our leaders preach the gospel of free trade despite the facts that show we are well on our way to becoming a low-wage, service economy. The latest indictment of the folly of the free trade philosophy comes in "Hard Work Can't Stop Hard Times" (front page, Nov. 25). In this article, the first of three in a series titled "Scraping By," you point out that "industries pressed by low-wage competitors overseas" have trimmed work forces or closed factories, "elminating more than 850,000 jobs in manufacturing, most of which paid well." In their place, we have millions of new jobs that "generally pay less and offer fewer benefits."
We have seen our high-wage industrial base virtually wiped out by unfair trade practices, such as dumping, and by our failure to protect this base. We have also watched foreigners capture this country's electronics and textile industries. In short, we have been giving away the store.
Some 25 years ago, I. W. Abel, who was then president of the United Steelworkers of America and the industrial union department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., warned in a Washington conference on international trade that unless the United States stopped playing the role of international Santa Claus, we Americans would wind up working in a service economy in which we tried to sell one another ice cream cones or rent one another motel rooms.

HEADLINE: Listen Up, Corporate America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
RJR Nabisco's Louis Gerstner Jr. offers a familiar but flawed and even tired argument that only a unified national marketplace, which new state government activism threatens, can save the competitiveness of American business ("Untangle the State Regulatory Web," Nov. 25). Even the choice of the word "web" wrongly equates public purpose with that of a spider.
Gerstner ignores two salient points. First, that several American states always have been strong regulators of business and vital policy crucibles. States always have had the option of setting higher environmental standards than the Federal Government, for example. Second, while Europe is moving toward more uniform standards and regulations, these will never exactly mirror those in the United States, Japan, Canada or anywhere else. There will continue to be wide differences in world marketplaces.
The most competitive companies thrive by being more flexible and more responsive to markets and customers. I.B.M. is only the latest company being forced to make that adjustment. As the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Commission on Industrial Productivity found in "Made in America: Regaining the Productive a study published last year, the adjustment involves shedding outdated mass-production and economies-of-scale strategies that Gerstner champions in his unified marketplace argument. Harvard's Michael Porter calls it being "fixated with static efficiency when progressiveness and innovation are far more important." M.I.T. prescribes new, long-term commitments to excellence; partnerships with workers, suppliers and customers, and responsiveness to differences in cultures, practices and habits.
The lesson for American executives is that the world owes neither your product nor your service a living. Neither does any individual American state. So move the American business mind off webs and onto delivering what the customer values. A clean environment, safe, healthy products and an ability to make an informed choice are part of the new definition of "quality product." And what state legislators hear is there for business executives, too.

HEADLINE: Japan Is Moving to Scale Back Military Spending

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Six weeks after Japan backed away from proposals to send its troops to the Persian Gulf, the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is putting the final touches on a five-year military program that for the first time in years will greatly slow the growth of the country's military spending.
The final plan is scheduled to be approved on Thursday by Mr. Kaifu's Cabinet. But earlier this week, under questioning in the Parliament, the Prime Minister suggested that Japan was planning to restore, in practice ifnot in policy, its self-imposed limit of spending no more than 1 percent of the country's gross national product on national defense.
 
That limit was swept away by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1987, in what was hailed at the time as a major symbolic change.
Should Japan return to its previous spending ceiling, first imposed in 1976 by Prime Minister Takeo Miki, it would appear to constitute a major setback for the United States. Throughout the 1980's American officials pressed Japan to greatly increase its military budget, its readiness, and its support for the 60,000 American troops based here. A limit on total military spending seems bound to heighten tensions with Washington over the size of that "burden-sharing," just at a time that Congress is insisting that Japan take a much larger share of the cost of basing troops in Japan.
Before Congress went out of session, it passed a nonbinding resolution that called on Japan to assume 100 percent of the yen costs of basing troops here, or risk a rapid withdrawal of American forces. Currently Japan pays about 40 percent of those costs, or roughly $3 billion, and it has indicated a willingness to raise this level to 50 percent. The Congressional vote, however, was prompted largely by frustration over Japan's unwillingness to provide more than just money for the Gulf effort.
In Parliament this week, Mr. Kaifu defended his plan to slow Japan's military buildup by pointing out that the rationale throughout the 1980's -- that Japan had to be prepared for an attack by the Soviet Union -- looks increasingly unrealistic. He said that the Government would have to reassess what kind of tanks, aircraft and warships it would need in the future.
 
Kaifu's Attitude
 But they also have major implications for Mr. Kaifu, a man of pacifist leanings who, by all reports, opposed the own party's efforts to enact a bill that would have allowed Japan to send troops to the Middle East in non-combat roles. The bill, and a new interpretation of the Japanese Constitution that was floated by Mr. Kaifu's Government to pave the way for the first overseas military mission since World War II, was withdrawn after overwhelming criticism from the public and opposition parties.
Even in the late 1980's, as Japan emerged as one of the biggest military spenders in the world, it never ventured far beyond the 1 percent line. The military budget rose fractionally above the limit for three years starting in 1987, but last year, when the economy grew faster than expected, it dropped just below. Still, the Japanese economy has surged ahead so rapidly in recent years that the budget of the Self-Defense Forces, as they are formally known, has regularly jumped 5 to 6 percent a year.
Japanese Government officials contend that there has been no change of policy, but that the days of big increases are over. "There is a general sense that there is no longer a need for that kind of increase," a senior Japanese diplomat said this week. Among the changes likely to be approved next week, for example, is a reduction of Japan's authorized ground forces from 180,000 men to about 150,000. But the old figure has been something of a fiction, because the military has not been able to attract enough recruits to reach its full strength.
The United States may find itself in a difficult position to press Japan for further buildup. At a time that the Pentagon budget itself is being cut, American diplomats say they can hardly urge Japan to take the opposite view. Nor do they want to be seen in the rest of Asia as urging Japan to rearm.

HEADLINE: 'Something Askew' In Society's Contrasts

 BODY:
The Oct. 21 issue was a puzzlement in contrasts. The front-page lead article was headlined "New Homes for Lives of Luxury Late in Life" and dealt with the growing older group of New Jersey citizens who are retiring to luxurious surroundings and the developing industry catering to them.
The Opinion page had an article with the headline "Spending a Night With the Homeless" and a subtitle, "The people at a shelter aren't so different from us."
Also on the front page was "S.& L. Crisis Hurting State's Economy." This article emphasized the difficulty that potential borrowers are having in borrowing funds in excess of 100 percent collateral.
I read this and learned that borrowers and bankers alike seemed to think such loans were not out of line since deposits were insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation for up to $100,000. No need for the bank to be careful.
What a confusing, unsettling grouping of articles. What a sad commentary on our present society. Are we really very much like, very close to the homeless? Who are those who live "lives of luxury late in life" who are so great in number as to create a whole new industry in the state?
And who are those who are borrowing from the banks in excess of 100 percent of their collateral? Is it right to make loans in excess of collateral and rely on the taxpayer to take up the risk such a loan involves?
There is enough food for thought here to last a lifetime. Who are we really most like? The luxury-living retirees? The high-flying borrowers? The homeless? Which is representative of our society? Do we have a "good" society when there are such extreme contrasts, where credit is so loosely provided?
If nothing else, one must at least recognize that such dramatically contrasting conditions and points of view cannot lead to a stable society or economy. There is something askew in New Jersey as well as the rest of our country.
Will we recognize this? Will we do something to correct it? Or will we wait for some calamity to bring us to our senses?

HEADLINE: Japanese Bank's Charity to Aid New Yorkers

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
The Industrial Bank of Japan Trust Company, a subsidiary of the world's seventh-largest financial institution, has created a foundation in New York to assist homeowners in the city's poorer neighborhoods and to help improve the schools.
The IBJ Foundation is just the latest example of Japanese philanthropy in the United States, but it is the first foundation created by a Japanese financial institution. Until now most Japanese philanthropies were established by companies that sell consumer goods like automobiles and electronics. For example, the Toshiba AmericanFoundation, created last May and based in New York, promotes science and technology curriculums in high schools. 
 The new foundation began with $2 million in assets, and that will be increased to $10 million in the near future, said Isamu Koike, chairman of the Trust Company.
Mr. Koike said the decision to set up a foundation was not motivated by a desire to attract new clients or burnish the bank's image.
"Our presence and success have grown and we have reached a stage where we want to show our appreciation to the host community for its enormous support during our 30 years here," he said. The bank is a subsidiary of the Industrial Bank of Japan, which has 1,200 employees in the United States, in its Park Avenue headquarters and branches in six other cities.
The bank's decision to go beyond traditional support of American universities and cultural centers, and to respond more directly to the needs of schools and neighborhoods in New York, was welcomed by others involved in philanthropic efforts, who said American banks were cutting back in their support.
"The question remains whether this is just one step by an enlightened financial institution or the start of a trend by others domiciled in New York to pick up the slack," said Dr. Delwin A. Roy, president of the Hitachi Foundation, the largest of the Japanese corporate philanthropies.
The IBJ Foundation's first round of grants will provide $50,000 for Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City to develop self-help centers for low- and moderate-income residents to receive financial counseling about mortgages, insurance and home repairs.
Another $50,000 will enable the Fund for New York City Public Education to improve geography education by strengthening teacher-training and by establishing two Geography Learning Outcome Based Education Centers, called GLOBE centers. The two learning centers, for sixth and ninth graders,will be equipped with maps, charts, globes, videotapes and computer software.
A third $50,000 grant will be used by National Public Radio to expand economics and business reporting to include a more international perspective.
Japanese corporate giving in the United States has increased from $85 million in 1987 to about $200 million annually, Dr. Roy and others said.
"There is a new enlightenment among Japanese businessmen that their contribution must go beyond check-writing and include personal involvement in American communities, especially where they have business interests," said Tadashi Yamamoto, president of the Japan Center for International Exchange and a leader in encouraging Japanese philanthropy.
But he said the growth of Japanesephilanthropy was still too slow given the "conspicuous" wealth and involvement of Japanese concerns in the United States.
He said Japanese business leaders had to be educated about philanthropy, which is still an unknown field to many because many Japanese expect charitable needs to be met by government, not private, resources.
"Japanese corporations also are becoming more sophisticated and professional in their giving programs, going beyond gifts to the blue-chip universities like Harvard and Stanford or the cultural icons," he said.
Because the IBJ Foundation is endowed by the IBJ Trust Company incorporated in the United States, the bank is entitled to tax benefits for its contributions.

HEADLINE: Man Killed on Corner, Apparently by a Stray Bullet

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A 42-year-old man was killed Friday evening, apparently by a stray bullet, as he was drinking wine with a friend on a street corner in his East Harlem neighborhood, the police said.
It was unclear yesterday whether the shot was intended for someone or the gunman was shooting for thrills or practice. But if Randall Wade, of 316 East 102d Street, was an unintended victim, as the police believe, he would be the 37th person to be killed in New York City this year by stray gunfire, Police Department records show. Ten of the victims were under the age of 14. 
 Mr. Wade was shot at 7:06 P.M. in front of the Heidi grocery store at 2029 First Avenue near 104th Street. He was drinking and chatting with friends at the time, the police said. They said the shot was fired from either the East River or the Woodrow Wilson housing projects, which rise between First Avenue and the East River.
Detectives canvassed the projects for witnesses yesterday, but by late afternoon they had no suspects.
 
A Divorced Father
 Mr. Wade, who was unemployed, lived most of his life in the neighborhood, said his mother, Delores Wade of the Bronx. He has an 18-year-old daughter, Tunisia, from his marriage, which ended in divorce several years ago, Mrs. Wade said.
"He was a brilliant boy," his mother said, "but he never could get his life together. He was always reading. You never saw him without a book or newspaper in his hands."
After his marriage ended he lost his job. "He hasn't been gainfully employed since," his mother said.
Mr. Wade started drinking heavily, his mother said, and spent a lot of time socializing on the street in East Harlem. He passed the Postal Service exam but never followed through on the job application, she said. For a while he worked as a cook in a soup kitchen for the homeless in Harlem.
Two weeks ago, he was hospitalized with pneumonia after he went to visit his parents. They saw that he was pale and sick and forced him to see a doctor, his mother said. When he came out of the hospital last week, she said, he looked "more like his old self" than he had in years. He told his mother he was planning to apply for a job with the city's Parks Department.

HEADLINE: Long Lines at a Failed Bank

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J., Dec. 15

 BODY:
Hundreds of people lined up today in sleet and snow to claim their savings from the United Savings Bank, which has been ordered to return deposits.
The Paterson police said more than 2,000 people waited to take their turn at United's main office. Customers began camping out there at 2 A.M. 
 Federal regulators seized the bank in May, accusing it of documenting loans improperly, offering risking interest rates, making unsafe real-estate loans and paying excessively high salaries.
The Federal agency that manages ailing thrift institutions, the Resolution Trust Corporation, closed the 49-year-old savings bank without warning on Thursday night.
"I made a deposit Wednesday and nobody said anything," said Regina Ellerbee, 36 years old, of Paterson.
But a Resolution Trust spokeswoman, Andrea Plater, said no one should have been surprised.
 
Couldn't Find a Buyer
 "They knew it was a troubled institution and the Government was trying to close it," she said. "Customers knew we were trying to find a buyer."
But Ms. Plater said Resolution Trust could not sell the bank; more than 680 solicitations had failed to bring a single bid, she said.
A former president of the bank, Donald J. Moskowitz, pleaded guilty in September to defrauding the bank of about $2.5 million. In November, a former controller, Ronald Rudd, pleaded guilty to Federal bank-fraud charges.
The thrift's branches in Parsippany-Troy Hills, Succasunna and Bricktown were also returning customer deposits. Refunds will continue during the week, and on Friday the bank will mail checks to depositors who have not claimed their money, officials said.
The bank has 32,300 accounts, with total deposits of $183.4 million.
Ms. Plater said officials have so far identified 11 accounts in excess of $100,000, the maximum sum insured by the Federal Government.

HEADLINE: Northeast Housing Slowdown Spreads Into Industry Recession

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
A prolonged slump in home sales that began in the New York and Boston areas soon after the stock market collapse of 1987 has expanded into a housing recession that engulfs much of the nation, according to economists and real estate executives.
As always, the strength of home sales varies in different regions and cities. One legacy of the economic boom of the 1980's, the experts say, is that those markets in which prices were propelled to the highest levels, particularly on the East and West Coasts, are now experiencing the deepest declines.
 
Volume and Prices Down
 But in a broad shift of economics and market psychology over the last six months, buyers have moved to the sidelines in almost every section of the nation. The sale of houses is down 7 percent from 1989. New construction is at its lowest level since 1982. Since July, the median price paid for houses around the country has fallen 6 percent. 
 At least for the moment, the American romance with home ownership appears to have cooled.
"The anxiety is national," said Louis H. Masotti, a professor of real estate at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management who is now a visiting faculty member at Stanford University.
"You look around the country and there are fewer and fewer spots of non-recession," he said.
Analysts attribute the downturn to a number of factors, some temporary and others deeply embedded in the economic downturn, which is having wide-ranging effects on people around the country. [Page 26.]
In addition, the housing analysts say other factors in the slump are fears of war in the Middle East, corporate job cuts, overbuilding, more stringent lending requirements by banks and savings institutions, demographic changes that have brought fewer first-time buyers into the market, and the simple fact that too few Americans can afford the prices being asked for homes, even where prices have fallen sharply.
"Buyers were lining up at the door, but that turned around in March," said Mike Cook, president of CedarMark Home Corpo-ration, a Seattle builder. Seattle had one of the nation's most robust housing markets in 1988 and 1989, with prices rising more than 20 percent a year.
Now, Seattle buyers have retreated and prices have fallen by more than 10 percent. Mr. Cook said, "We are trying to sell off excess inventory."
Smaller cities in the Midwest are proving more resistant to the downturn. But they are not immune.
 
Michigan Listings Climb
 In Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, Mich., the number of "for sale" listings has climbed nearly 50 percent this year, to 1,749 in October. "It is typical of what is happening across the country," said Dennis R. Capozza, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan.
In Indianapolis, James and Lynn Meyers paid $162,000 for a four-bedroom colonial house in October, but made their decision only after a marathon house hunt that real estate executives say has become standard procedure around the country. They looked at more than 100 properties.
Buying a house now "is a leap of faith," Mr. Meyers said. Houses in Indianapolis are "just not moving," he said.
And in Florida, builders in Tampa, Orlando, St. Petersburg and other cities are struggling to sell a bloated inventory of new houses and condominiums intended for retirees and other migrants from northern states. The problem, they say, is that would-be buyers cannot sell their homes in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and other states that have been mired in the real estate slump for more than two years, so they are postponing the move south.
 
Still, a Modest Slump
 "We are dealing with a ripple effect," said Douglas Buck, director of community affairs for the Florida Association of Home Builders.
Housing markets have always moved in cycles, and the current downturn appears modest when compared with the sharp slump in 1981 and 1982 when interest rates on mortgage loans soared to more than 16 percent. The National Association of Realtors, a trade group in Washington, estimated this week that 3.2 million American houses would be sold by the end of this year. While that would be down 7 percent from 1989, it still represents 60 percent more sales than in 1982, when the housing market had reached its lowest point in recent years.
And while home ownership remains beyond the reach of millions of Americans, it is getting closer. With prices coming down in some regions, interest rates falling and incomes rising slightly, studies show that houses are more affordable than at any time since 1978.
One analysis in October, by the National Association of Realtors, found that the median family income of $35,353 was 110 percent of what was necessary to qualify to buy a house at $92,800, the median price for the nation. The study also found that the median selling price of houses had sharply fallen since July, when it reached a record high of $98,300.
 
New York Market Is Tough
 Regional variations remain wide. Another study of median incomes and house prices by MortgageWright Inc., a mortgage banking company in Richmond, Va., found that the least affordable markets included the New York City area, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In New York, the study found that the median family income of $36,900 was only 68 percent of the amount needed to qualify for the median priced house of $175,000.
That contrasts sharply with many cities in the South and Midwest, where home ownership is a comparatively simple option. The MortgageWright study found that Saginaw, Mich., with a median family income of $37,200, or slightly higher than in New York, was the easiest place to buy a house. The median home price there is $49,300.
Because housing costs remain high in the Northeast and California, the slump could last longer in those areas.
"House prices have reached such rarified levels compared to incomes that they cannot be sustained," said David Shulman, a real estate analyst for Salomon Brothers, the securities firm. "It is going to take several years of income growth" to resurrect the most expensive markets, he said.
Hardest hit by the downturn this year has been Southern California, where housing demand seemed unaffected by the 1987 stock market drop, and prices soared in 1988 and 1989. Now, "for sale" signs have multiplied, and analysts in the region say sellers would be lucky to get 80 percent of what they could have a year ago.
 
California Couple Hurt
 One couple who suffered from the drop were Bruce Bigelow, a reporter at The San Diego Tribune, and Lynn O'Shaugnessy, a freelance journalist. "We were crestfallen," Mr. Bigelow said after they sold their two-bedroom bungalow in the Silverlake area of downtown Los Angeles for $225,000 this month.
Mr. Bigelow said the buyer, a Los Angeles lawyer, agreed to pay $248,000 in September, but the bank appraiser would approve financing only at a sale price of up to $220,000. So the buyer went to another bank, and its appraiser put the limit at $210,000.
Ultimately, Mr. Bigelow said, he and the buyer accepted the first appraisal, and the buyer agreed to pay $220,000 with bank financing, and another $5,000 in cash. The price was just enough to cover what Mr. Bigelow and Ms. O'Shaugnessy had paid in 1988, plus money they had spent for improvements.
"It was like being hit with hammer," Mr. Bigelow said, "watching the value of our house plummet."
 
New York Market Up Slightly
 Studies offer some evidence that the New York City area market, hit first and hardest by the current downturn, may have reached bottom in selling prices, or come close to it. An analysis by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey showed last week that average selling prices of suburban homes in the area fell sharply in 1988 and 1989, to $174,700 from $186,600.
This year, the study found prices coming back, albeit gradually. In the second quarter of 1990 it found an average price of $175,400, and during the third quarter, an average of $176,700.
Other measures of the housing market in the New York City area are less encouraging. Listings of unsold properties remain huge and many homes have been languishing on the market for more than a year.
Still, for those who can afford to, buying a home now may prove wise.
"We seem to have hit a floor of resistence," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist for the Port Authority. "People are unwilling to lower prices any more, and somewhere there will be a trigger that will clear the market."
 
Interest Rates Falling
 One such trigger for slumping home sales around the nation could be further declines in interest rates. Fixed 30-year mortgage loans, which rose to more than 10.50 percent during the spring, have since fallen sharply and are now offered at 9.5 percent in most regions. Economists said they may go lower, perhaps to 9 percent.
But a futher reduction in rates might still not be enough to end the slump. Analysts maintain that the current housing recession is different from those in the past because interest rates, even at recent levels, have not been unusually high.
Part of the problem, they say, could be tied to the gloomy economic outlook. The Government said Friday that the output of the country's industries dropped 1.7 percent in November, the third monthly decline and the biggest in nearly eight years, hinting of a deeper recession than had been widely assumed.
"Things have been really shaky out there," said Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, referring as well to the political outlook in the world. "Consumer psychology is the key now."

HEADLINE: NASA Aura Dims as City Fights Rocket Test

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAY ST. LOUIS, Miss., Dec. 11

 BODY:
Back in the 1960's, when the space program started testing rocket motors in a big tract of swamp near here, many people felt proud and patriotic about the loud noises and smoke plumes in their woods.
Those kinds of feelings for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are now rare. What once was a symbol of America's scientific superiority has lost prestige everywhere due to some spectacular failings, and along this stretch of the Gulf Coast the space agency is now commonly viewed with fear and distrust.
The dispute here is over a plan by the agency to test a new rocket motor for the space shuttle. Despite repeated assurances from NASA, many residents fear that the tests, each of which will release 350 tons of chemicals into the woods about 12 miles from Main Street, will pollute the environment and endanger the public.
 
'Nothing but Moonshine'
 Unlike the liquid-fuel motors that have been tested here in the past and that produce exhaust made up of water vapor, the new one uses solid fuel and produces an exhaust composed of hydrogen chloride gas, particles of aluminum compounds and other chemicals.
"When NASA first came in, there was nothing much but moonshine in Hancock County, and it was really great for us to feel like we had something to do with sending Americans to the moon," said Dr. Bert Chevis, a local physician.
"That was when the space program was like a young, top-of-the-line surgeon," he said. "Well, it's gotten to be like an old doctor that's forgetful and doing things upside down all the time."
In recent months apprehension over pollution from the rocket exhaust has suddenly produced long petitions and loud protests at public meetings.
Next week state officials are to start considering whether the John C. Stennis Space Center, named for the state's Senator from 1947 to 1989, should receive the environmental permits it needs to start construction at the testing site so that the first rockets can be fired on schedule in 1994.
 
Fight May Go to Court
 This application process is likely to become a major stumbling block for the shuttle program because angry citizens have vowed to take their fight to the courts, if necessary.
Support for the program comes primarily from the business community in the area, which has an unemployment level that is consistently above the national average, which was 5.9 percent in November. Fred Sullivan, president of Darkat Inc., a management consulting company that helps small businesses applying for NASA contracts, said, "We feel the environmental question has been answered, and as far as the economy is concerned, we dare not turn our backs on this opportunity."
But Lisa Cowand, a member of the Hancock County Board of Supervisors, said the promise of an economic contribution by the space complex had not helped the agency's position here. "The rocket might mean some new jobs in the short term," she said. "But, if they build it, no businesses are ever going to want to move down here again, and we'll end up the losers in the long term."
The space agency's plan calls for the new motors to be fired while anchored to the ground in a horizontal position. Seven such tests would be conducted in the first two years of the program and two a year after that.
The exhaust from the 1.2 million pounds of fuel in each firing would shoot from the device's nozzles at a temperature of 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit and at a speed of 5,500 miles an hour. The space agency says a ramp would deflect the exhaust upward and that air currents would carry it away before it could seriously harm any people or wildlife.
 
Concerns About Exhaust
 Opponents of the test argue that in certain kinds of weather the exhaust would remain close enough to the ground to endanger thousands of people close by and to pose risks as far away as New Orleans, 50 miles southwest of Bay St. Louis. They argue that hydrogen chloride gas in the exhaust will come down as acid rain, bringing with it particles of aluminum compounds that can increase the risk of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.
The space agency disputes those assertions.
Although pollution is the main point of the dispute, NASA's problems with its Hancock County neighbors reflect a broader distrust of the space agency that was brought about by the 1986 Challenger disaster and a number of subsequent mishaps, including the computer malfunctions and plumbing problems in the latest shuttle mission. Also this week a Federal advisory panel issued a report calling for drastic changes in the agency's approach to space exploration. A central recommendation of the panel is that NASA rely less on shuttles and more on unmanned rockets.
"We don't believe that NASA knows what they're doing," said Robert Esher, head of environmental research at a Mississippi State University research unit located at the Stennis Space Center.
Mr. Esher has played a leading role in arousing public opposition by providing an expert view that challenges NASA on the scientific aspects of the environmental dispute. But he has also been relentlessly attacking NASA's integrity.
"They've done all they could to keep the truth from coming out," he said at a public hearing last week on the NASA permits. The hearing drew 750 people from this town of 7,000.
 
'Falling Apart'
 The shuttle, he said, "is falling apart." And in his toughest assertion, he said, "I think when we look back in history at the Challenger disaster, we know what NASA is like. NASA knew three years before that those rings were leaking." The 1986 Challenger explosion, which killed seven astronauts, was linked to the failure of rings designed to prevent hot exhaust gases from escaping.
When Mr. Esher was finished, the crowd gave him a standing ovation.
The extent of the skepticism in the auditorium was evident when Thomas Sones, 16 years old, the president of the student government at the Hancock County High School, added his voice to the opposition. The school, about two miles from the proposed test complex, would be among the first structures affected if the fumes did not behave as NASA predicts.
"Personally I think there's a lot of hiding," he said.
As the hearing ended, Roy Estess, director of the space center, wearily defended his agency. "We have an expert test team we believe is the best in the free world," he said. "We're proud of what we do. We don't back away from it at all. It's based on the best engineering judgment our country has to offer."
The Advanced Solid Rocket Motor, or ASRM, as the device to be tested is known, is the third version of a motor that has been launching the shuttle since it first flew in 1981, and it resembles the others in many ways.
 
Tests in Utah
 NASA has plans to use the new solid-fuel rocket motor on the shuttle for 30 years. Although the advisory panel report this week suggested that the shuttle program be curtailed in favor of unmanned rockets, the new shuttle motor would likely play a role in whatever launching system might replace the shuttle because developing all-new technology could severely delay the space program.
The two previous versions of the shuttle engine were manufactured and tested in a part of Utah that is mostly desert and is relatively remote. And much of the debate here centers on whether the Mississippi coast is an inherently more dangerous place to conduct such tests.
In addition, some local residents assert that NASA revealed one of its basic flaws by even considering this place for the tests.
When Congress considered plans for the new motor in 1987, Representative Jamie L. Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi, suggested that it be built -- but not necessarily tested -- at an abandoned nuclear power plant in his district about 300 miles northeast of here. NASA saw the wisdom of this recommendation from Mr. Whitten, who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and has great influence on the agency's budget.
After the decision was made to build the motors in northeastern Mississippi, NASA considered several testing sites, and eventually chose to test the motors here because of concerns about the cost and difficulty of transporting the huge motors large distances, said Rebecca McCaleb, environmental projects officer at the Stennis Space Center.

HEADLINE: STATES TRY PACTS TO AID ECONOMIES

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
W. Allan Anderson's tiny trade office on Toronto's Richmond Street is still too new to have a permanent nameplate on the door. That will come in about two weeks. But some economists and state political leaders say the lonely little outpost is already a sign of the future.
Mr. Anderson's mission is as straightforward as it is unusual. As the first director of the Canada trade liaison office for the Council of Great Lakes Governors, his job is to promote trade between Canada and the eight-state Great Lakes region. 
 The jostling, often cutthroat trade competition that has marked relations among the states for most of their history has not been eliminated. But state officials say that Mr. Anderson's assignment to increase trade between Canada and the Great Lakes states nonetheless represents new ground.
 
Still a Rarity
 Economists and state development officials say such efforts are still rare, especially in politically delicate areas like jobs and trade. But the officials say the states are under more pressure to cooperate in ways that were unthinkable only a few years ago.
Many states face budget constraints and cannot support initiatives to promote themselves or their products, even though development officials see the importance of foreign trade and the threat of growing competition from abroad. Changes in the world economy, especially in western Europe, also favor such collaborations, some economists say, and a result could be that go-it-alone states might become less competitive over time.
Still, most of the steps toward greater cooperation have been tentative. When development officials from Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana combined in 1988 to jointly seek Japanese investment in the lower Mississippi River valley, they jointly paid for the trip to Japan, made a joint presentation for the region, but then retired to privately bend their hosts' ears about each state's individual virtues.
The Mid-South Trade Council, a six-state consortium founded in 1983 by Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana and Kentucky, has been unable to even establish a permanent office or hire any staff because of fears in the state capitols that sharing information will mean the loss of some individual competitive edge.
"The states have different political mandates, and a lot of them change every four years," said Leigh A. Wieland, director of the export office for the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development.
 
Economic Health a Factor
 The economic downturn in many states is also acting to dampen broad initiatives. An economic panel created by the New England Governors' Conference recently urged that the states offer a regional tax credit to encourage new investment, as well as a research and development tax credit to encourage innovation. But with almost every state in the conference facing the prospect of falling revenue, even the most enthusiastic proponents saw little likelihood of any action that would further reduce revenue.
Even Mr. Anderson's efforts in Toronto, while hailed as a major symbolic landmark, do not reflect as much cooperation as it would appear. Each of his Great Lakes clients -- Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York -- gets an equal crack at competing for any new business referred through the Toronto office.
"I think there is a trend, but it's still at the very early stages," said Carol Conway, deputy director of the Southern Growth Policies Board, a private research group that tracks state economic policies. "It's going to take some time to change the view that you can't cooperate without losing out."
But among the truly converted, including many economists and some elected officials, the future direction is clear: Those states that do not grasp cooperation now will be left behind by the century's close.
 
Economics Is 'Driving Force'
 "Political boundary lines are becoming substantially less important," said State Senator Alan Bluechel of Washington, who is one of the main proponents in an effort to form a confederation of Pacific Northwest states and Canadian provinces. "The driving force in the world today is economics."
Mr. Bluechel, co-founder of a group called the Pacific Northwest Legislative Leadership Forum, said he believes that in the evolving world economy, as it is being redefined by changes in Europe, at least 12 million people are needed to build industries big enough to compete with other export-driven economies. With linked economies, the states of Washington, Oregon, Montana, Alaska and the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, pass that threshold, with 15 million people, Mr. Bluechel said. Operating as a single economy, the region would have the 10th-highest gross national product in the world.
Organized a year ago, the group's members are at the point of hammering out the wording of the articles of incorporation for the confederation. The group will create a permanent economic steering committee that will be jointly financed by the members.
At the Great Lakes Toronto office, by contrast, the goals are a bit more modest and immediate. Mr. Anderson said the first business link made through his office was made this month between a small Milwaukee-based maker of pollution-control equipment and a Canadian agent who agreed to represent the company across the border. So far there have been no sales.

HEADLINE: Recession's Pinch Fuels Fears About the Future

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
A Wisconsin businessman whose client list has shriveled asks his children for understanding this Christmas. A Boston cab driver, getting fewer riders and smaller tips, works an extra four hours a day to make ends meet. A Seattle art dealer whose customers have grown wary cancels her plans for a vacation abroad.
In varying degrees, Americans are feeling the pinch of the emerging recession. For some, it has meant leaner times; for others, anxiety about the future. In some instances, clearly the minority, it has even helped business. 
 "The rent's overdue, gas is overdue, electric's overdue," said Cheryl Shamus, 30 years old, who was shopping for a maternity dress at the Goodwill Industries store in St. Charles, Mo. Her husband, a factory worker, can no longer depend on regular paychecks because of the slowdown. "There's not going to be a Christmas, let's put it that way," she said.
Although the majority of Americans have not lost jobs or income in the downturn, many have grown anxious about what the next year may bring. They are spending less, trying to save more and making contingency plans.
To many people interviewed at random around the country last week, there was a parallel between the economy and the situation in the Persian Gulf: a worried sense that disaster might be looming, but no direct effect, not yet anyway.
Indeed, roughly the same number of people have been sent or mobilized for Persian Gulf duty, 400,000, as have lost jobs since August.
 
No Major Purchases
 "My job is secure, my company is solid, but there's still a bit of anxiety," said Richard Whittow, a banking executive in Milwaukee. "I wouldn't want to make any major purchases right now. If we spend money we've got, fine. But I wouldn't want to lock into anything."
That caution appears to be widely shared, as many retailers complain that stores are uncrowded, just a week before Christmas. A New York Times/ CBS News poll, conducted Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, found that more than 4 of 10 respondents are spending less on Christmas than in past years. A similar poll conducted in November 1987, a month after the stock market crash, found that 3 of 10 people planned to spend less on Christmas than in previous years.
Around the country, it is hard to find anyone who believes that times will get better before they get worse. The national economic picture is somewhat uneven. The regions that boomed in the 1980's, like the Northeast and Southern California, appear to have been hit the hardest.
David Jameison, 48, a hotel concierge in Boston, said the Christmas gifts would be smaller this year. "The economy is forcing us to cut back on the gifts," he said. "With m wife, when times were good, I used to give her jewelry and furs. This year, it is going to be a lot less."
He said his brother-in-law, who owned a small construction business, filed for bankruptcy six months ago. "It's difficult for him to even hold on to his house, not to mention Christmas gifts," he said.
 
Busy Calendar, Now Nothing
 For most of the year, business was great for Antonio Jebian, the owner of a construction company in Coral Gables, Fla. His calendar was filled with major home-remodeling projects. Then came autumn.
"Everything was going fine," he said. "I was very busy, and I didn't even advertise, just an ad in the Yellow Pages. But things started slowing down in the beginning of November. Now, people are calling, but only for estimates."
For those who were already struggling, the downturn has sometimes pushed them beyond the brink. At some charities, the number of recipients has soared. A food pantry in Watertown, Mass., for example, has seen its client list double in a year.
"If it keeps up at this pace," said Barbara Neel, coordinator at the Watertown Food Pantry, "I don't know if we'll have enough food."
Even businesses serving the affluent are hurting. Lori Kinnear, who runs a private children's dance studio in Seattle, said five students dropped out in the last month.
"Dance lessons are the first thing people cut back on," Ms. Kinnear said.
Nina Ventura, an art dealer in Seattle, said she would be putting off plans to travel abroad. "Instead of going to Hong Kong this year, I'm going to San Francisco."
With cutbacks in corporate expense accounts, employees are spending less and fewer people are doing business over lunch. In Washington, the stretch limousines that come and go from embassy parties and Capitol Hill are still part of the daily scenery, but fewer companies are paying for their managers to ride in such luxury.
"The corporations have trimmed their expense accounts and don't rent as many luxury cars," said Chip Prescott, president of Dominion Limousine Service in McLean, Va. He added that people are not tipping as much these days.
"The $200 tip has been replaced by the $20 bill," he said.
In a few fields, like bankruptcy law, the hard times have helped business. The same is true for temporary employment.
"A company may be laying people off, but they still need to get the payroll out," said Pat Southerland, president of Robert Haft, a Washington company that specializes in placing accountants. And with so many qualified people looking for work, he said, it has been easier than ever to find workers.
Charles D. Miles, a fire safety director at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York, said he would cut back on vacations to pay off his credit card bills.
 
'Don't Live Extravagantly'
 "I don't live extravagantly," he said, "but I'm cutting out some of the fun things, like vacations."
In general, however, travel bookings have not dropped, agencies say. In fact, reservations on cruise lines have increased.
In Florida, the tourist industry remains strong, bolstered by a flood of foreign visitors who have taken advantage of the weak dollar. Figures from the Florida Division of Tourism show that for the first nine months of the year, 32 million people visited the state, a 6.5 percent increase over the same period last year.
Vacancies in hotels have increased, but industry analysts say that reflects new construction rather than recessionary forces.
As companies cut back, the businesses that cater to them are also feeling the pinch. Randy Clevers, 36, who runs a small business cleaning offices in Sheboygan, Wis., said he and his wife are planning a more modest Christmas. "We've talked to the children about it," he said. "We're going to try to make things, rather than buy them."
He went on: "You start wondering where the next dollar will come from. At my wife's factory, they've been laying people off, and she's worried she'll be next."
Even for workers whose jobs seem secure, there is a fear that a recession will stifle chances for promotion.
Jeff Sloan, who manages a convenience store in St. Louis, worries that a slowdown will keep him from advancing in the store chain.
"What does concern me is the more skilled people getting into the job market and affecting my advancement," he said, adding that the store chain has been receiving applications from people 10 years his senior with midlevel management experience in corporate offices.
 
'Don't Even Ask'
 Few segments of the economy seen untouched by the slowdown.
Tony K. Grubbs, who manages a Red Wing Shoes store near St. Louis, said his customers are thinking twice about buying expensive work boots.
"In the past, people were willing to pay extra for top quality," he said, noting that work boots range in price from $80 to $200. "Now people are coming in saying, 'I don't have the money, so I'm going to a discount store.' I'm hearing that more and more."
Perry Karakostas, a Boston cab driver, has had to extend his work day from 10 hours to 14 hours, just to keep up.
"Last year, I made $38,000," he said. "This year, don't even ask. I don't think I am going to make $18,000.
He had been driving his blue cab through the streets of Boston, looking for customers, but finding few.
"It's 11:30, I've been out since 6 this morning, and I've made $38," he said.
"I have a year and a half left to pay for this thing," he said, referring to his car. "I just hope I don't lose it."

With him was his wife, Maria Isabella. (Susan Greenwood for The New York Times)

Contented With the Time

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
All year long the city seems decorated for Christmas, the white lights draped profligately around its towers, the brake lights of the cars in rush-hour traffic looking like cranberries strung for the tree, snaking their way in loose patterns up and down the exit ramps of the highways.
Elsewhere the holidays transform drab Main Streets into Bavarian villages, but in New York the effect is a little like a woman already wearing a bracelet and earrings who decides to add a brooch. The lighted tree towering above the skaters at Rockefeller Center. The windows of the department stores, where people stand instead of dashing by. And at the florists, the obligatory scarlet amaryllis, forced from a bulb just in time for an end table in December, the poinsettia of the smart set. 
 Twelve months a year New York is a city of contrasts, but never more than now. Little girls in their best velvets and Mary Janes walk to the ballet past men sleeping beneath their coats. At a store near City Hall, a teen-aged girl counts her cash carefully, shopping for a leather jacket for her boyfriend. She knows exactly what she wants: a match for the jacket he was wearing the night he was mugged. "They took it right off of him," she says, looking through the rack. "He loved that jacket."
It has been that kind of year. Someone said not long ago, "The 90's will be the 80's without money." It's a wonderful wisecrack, but it's not true. The 90's are the 80's with chronic fatigue syndrome. There's this essential malaise that everyone is trying to identify, analyze, above all dispel, a flu of the spirit. The great contrasts in New York this year are not only between rich and poor but between what the city is and what it has been.
It tells my age that I remember waiting for after-Christmas sales; now the sales are during, before, anything to get the registers ringing. Corporations are scaling back Christmas parties, or dropping them altogether. Christmas parties! That staple of movie comedies, that legendary location of so many ill-advised marriages of alcohol and lust.
What's the point? None of this. We lost the point the day we decided that you should be able to call an 800 number and order cranberries already strung for the tree. Because the point was the stringing, wasn't it? We lost the point when we decided you should be able to order a tree from a catalogue, to be delivered already decorated. Because decorating the thing is surely the point.
The point is that this is a holiday that has somehow managed to endure through times much worse than these, and that is because it has always stood for not what we are, or what we were, but what we wish we could be. That's what we're chasing when we run ourselves ragged with parties and presents. It is a time for happy families even among families that are not particularly happy. It is a time for friendship even with friends with whom we often feud.
Every story that survives from generation to generation about this time is about a small thing transformed: a nutcracker, a boy with a crutch, a bright-eyed old angel trying to earn his wings. A manger. "They were not a handsome family," Dickens wrote of the Cratchits in "A Christmas Carol." "They were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time."
We are not contented with the time. The stores are not crowded. Of course, we can contrast that with the holidays in the Soviet Union, where people are hotfooting it home with cabbages to hoard. We can contrast it, too, with a time just past when we bought not what we wanted or needed but anything we could lay our hands on. Now, like Peter, we've seen the pawnbroker. Santa Claus is coming to town with his bag half full. What'll we tell the kids?
Let them string cranberries.
People say we're going to have to learn to do more with less in the near future, and I believe it. But this is the time of year when less was more all along. We just forgot it. The eternal verities, friendship and family and faith, are cheap and filling. And you won't find them on your Amex bill next month like a bad hangover.
New York will still be covered with tinsel every night of its life. But it's nice to know that if the lights went out, it could still be Christmas, inside our houses and apartments and ourselves, where Christmas has always belonged.

The End Is Near

 BODY:
The formal Federal statistics don't yet spell recession but informal language does. Whatever the G.N.P. figures show, public discourse is already heavy with apocalyptic terms. Observe, for instance, the frequency of draconian.
Connoisseurs of journalistic cliches know the term derives from the Athenian legal code that a fellow named Draco formulated about 621 B.C. It was pretty draconian all right, prescribing the death penalty for almost every offense. Times haven't yet gotten that tough, even in New York real estate, but everywhere, Draco's name is used in pain.
 Writers seem almost daily to refer to "draconian Gramm-Rudman spending cuts," the "draconian" speed with which new regulations have been pressed on financial institutions and "draconian" cuts in New York state spending.
The word from Europe, meanwhile, is even more alarming. Just before the world trade talks collapsed last week in Brussels, John C. Crosbie, Canada's Trade Minister, said grimly, "It's back to ground zero." He was right to be alarmed but things are not that bad. What Mr. Crosbie probably meant was square one, back to the beginning. Ground zero means the surface area directly below or above the point of detonation of a nuclear bomb. Far from denoting a beginning, it suggests something much closer to the end.

Gorbachev Turns To the Forces Of Law and Order

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
WHEN it suited him, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been the glasnost President, the democracy President, the peacemaker President, the economic reform President. He has also been at times the law and order President, and never more than right now.
The Soviet leader's drift to the right in recent weeks has been steady enough to revive fears among the more pessimistic of his subjects that Mr. Gorbachev is inching toward dictatorship. 
 Speculation that he might join forces with the popular insurgents has gone with the last autumn leaves. Mr. Gorbachev finds them too inflexible, too impatient and too divided to serve his immediate purpose of stability. Lacking popular authority of his own, Mr. Gorbachev has turned back to the institutions that are conditioned to respect the chain of command -- the military, the police and the Communist Party.
So the clamorous cast of reform economists who were Mr. Gorbachev's most conspicuous company in the fall have now given way to the Defense Minister and the chairman of the K.G.B., sent by the President to prime time television to warn vaguely of tough measures against black marketers, draft dodgers, nationalists and others who threaten public order.
The immediate agenda has changed, too. Mr. Gorbachev's priorities of the moment are arresting the breakup of the union and restoring discipline. When questions of liberty arise these days, Mr. Gorbachev is more often to be found appealing to the conservative instincts of his countrymen than prodding them to open their minds. He opposed the right of Russian peasants to buy and sell farmland, for example, and created a state committee to fight the country's mild epidemic of erotica.
Is this all a prelude to a Gorbachev autocracy, or another tactical move in the long course of reform?
The Western governments that have been pumping food and medicine to Moscow -- including the Bush Administration, which last week waived a 16-year ban and offered up to $1 billion in grain credits -- are betting that Mr. Gorbachev does not intend a serious crackdown on political liberties. Western donors fear a greater danger is that lengthening food lines could turn into food riots, and the hard-liners may exploit the instability to roll back reforms or take power.
The Western assistance is intended to replenish the depleted central food funds under Mr. Gorbachev's control, which he can parcel out to meet local needs and quell political unrest.
The relief is also a demonstration to those who might be tempted to challenge Mr. Gorbachev that Western good will hinges in large part on respect for this one man.
This would not be the first time Mr. Gorbachev had paused to consolidate his position before mounting a new assault on the establishment. A year ago, for example, Mr. Gorbachev was threatening to rein in the Soviet press, and declaring the country unready for a multiparty system or private property. Since then he has sponsored laws abolishing censorship, erasing the Communist Party's monopoly from the Constitution, and legalizing limited private ownership.
One incentive for a bit of conservative repositioning is that on Monday the Congress of Peoples Deputies, the elephantine super-parliament that is supposed to be the supreme legal authority of the country, gathers in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses for its fourth session.
The first three Congresses have been noisy but ultimately obedient to Mr. Gorbachev, who designed the quasi-democratic body to minimize unwelcome surprises. (A third of the 2,250 members hold unelected seats allotted to the Communist Party and other bastions of the old establishment, and many more contrived to win their seats without competition.)
The Congress chose Mr. Gorbachev as President, and has enlarged his powers whenever he asked. A main issue this week is Mr. Gorbachev's latest proposal to restructure the Government in a way that makes his pre-eminence even clearer. It is likely to be approved, clearing the way for a major shake-up in the Government, including the likely replacement of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
But this time Mr. Gorbachev will be playing to a crowd that has grown more conservative, and less predictable. The radical opposition is in disarray -- two of the most radical delegations, from Lithuania and Armenia, plan to boycott the Congress altogether -- and the hard-liners are feeding on popular discontent.
The most aggressive bloc of deputies is now the hard-line Soyuz group, which blames Mr. Gorbachev for letting central discipline grow slack. One Soyuz leader has threatened to raise the question of impeaching Mr. Gorbachev at the Congress if he has not taken the country firmly in hand.
At the Congress -- and afterward -- the Soviet leader's most urgent objective will be to build a backfire against the raging separatism that threatens to dissolve the U.S.S.R. into a collection of warring principalities.
He will ask the Congress to approve in concept a new union treaty that would bind the republics in a looser confederation. So far he has been unable to get a consensus among republican leaders, who insist on stripping the center of more economic and political power than Mr. Gorbachev is yet willing to surrender. This issue, more than anything else, has driven Mr. Gorbachev lately into the arms of the conservatives.
While the high profile of the K.G.B. and the military are the most spine-tingling evidence, there is much more. A K.G.B. veteran has been installed as Minister of Internal Affairs, with the former commander of Soviet forces in Afghanistan as his deputy. Mr. Gorbachev has decreed the creation of worker vigilante committees to reassert central control over food distribution that has been lost in the more liberal climate.
He has been more attentive lately to the Communist Party, which he heads but which he had been keeping at a Presidential distance. Last month he rallied Communists in the parliament of the Russian republic in an attempt to undercut Boris N. Yeltsin's assertion of greater sovereignty. Last week he called in the party's governing Central Committee to consult them on the union treaty. The party's membership is fast eroding, its prestige is nil, and in some cities party leaders seem preoccupied with laundering the party's wealth into new commercial ventures. But the party network still has clout in the provinces, in the military and in some key industrial sectors.
The Soviet leader has also begun an aggressive courtship of the Central Asian republics, where democracy has not yet made much of an impression. Uzbekistan's cotton farmers have been promised a doubling of state prices on their crop. Kazakstan's popular President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been floated as a candidate to be Mr. Gorbachev's new Vice President or Prime Minister. The Asian republics showed last week what a useful ally they can be when they teamed up to threaten maverick Moldavia with a trade cutoff if it continues to resist signing the new union treaty.
So far Mr. Gorbachev's flirtation with the hard-liners has consisted of some hardball politics and some ominous warnings. But assuming that he only wants to stabilize things before moving forward again with reform, there is still the question of whether he will get what he wants.
"These are the institutions that control the instruments of violence," observed a veteran Kremlinologist in one Western embassy, surveying Mr. Gorbachev's recent choice of friends. "Gorbachev may not be preparing to use violence, but there is the danger that he could lose the initiative, and it passes into the hands of those more ready to use violence -- either to hold the union together, or to tear it apart."

Not Getting Ahead? Better Get Used to It

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
FOR a brief moment in the mid-1980's, it looked as if Americans would again know how it feels to get ahead. Wages and family incomes seemed to be rising by just enough to promise more prosperous lives. Some economists even warned that inflated wage costs would price American products out of the world market. But whatever the promise of higher incomes in the mid-80's, it is gone now.
Instead of continuing to rise, real incomes -- that is, wages and salaries adjusted for inflation -- have declined over the last three years, with the decline becoming particularly noticeable this fall, as the national economy slowed. The upshot is that most Americans are entering the 1990's worse off than they were in the early 1970's. Only those Americans whose incomes are in the top 20 percent have escaped this stagnation; their incomes have grown significantly. 
 The last time that most Americans could track tangible improvements in their incomes was in the late 1960's and early 1970's. The decade between the 1973 Arab oil embargo and the 1982 recession was one in which incomes did not rise nearly as rapidly as inflation. Then, after 1982, with inflation very low, there seemed to be some gaining ground again. But hopes of more to come were dashed in the last 18 months, so that today the pay of many individuals and the pooled weekly wages of millions of families buy less than in 1973.
"We're talking pennies when we talk of the improvements in the mid-1980's," said Lawrence Mishel, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research group. "Wages did not rise very much; inflation fell, giving an illusion of real wage gains."
The early 1990's are likely to be years of no progress, many economists believe. The Persian Gulf crisis is clearly a setback, with its high oil prices driving the inflation rate well above the norm for recent years. But even when the crisis ends and oil prices drop, wage increases are likely to lag behind inflation. The nation is apparently entering a recession, unemployment is rising and, as a result, the wages of most Americans are not rising by enough to overtake even mild inflation.
All told, the United States is approaching 20 years of lost income growth, notes Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist. "That does not make for a very happy society," he said.
The fallout from Mr. Freeman's lost income growth shows up as angry anti-tax protests, and as a drag on the national economy. The tax revolts in many communities lately have been aimed at local governments that tried to raise property taxes. In effect, they asked for ever bigger portions of a homeowner's stagnant income.
"In the 1960's, government also took more in taxes, but then real wages were going up 1 or 2 percent a year, and taxes were taking only one-third of this extra income and it wasn't so noticeable because people still improved their living standards," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Similarly, sales of consumer goods are difficult to sustain when the price of a car or a suit rises from one year to the next by a greater amount than the buyer's income. Partly for this reason, Christmas retail sales are taking a beating, helping to push the economy into recession.
Finally, national savings suffer when Americans spend more and more of their incomes to maintain their living standards. Savings, in turn, supply the money that is borrowed to finance new factories, machinery, highways, airports, schools and the other investments that generate a nation's wealth. As a percent of Americans' income, personal savings are only half what they were in the early 1970's. A blip upward in the late 1980's, coinciding with a brief rise in real incomes, is disappearing.
"It is very hard to save in a world in which your income is falling," said Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
The fall and rise and fall again of wages and incomes show up clearly in several Government statistics. The real median hourly pay for 93 million workers, for instance, see-sawed from $8.52 in 1973 to $7.66 in 1982, then up to $7.83 in 1988 and down to $7.46 today. The median weekly pay of full-time workers followed a similar pattern.
Families did better, given the increase in the number of households with two or more incomes in the 1980's. But here, too, the down-up-down pattern was the same. Median weekly family earnings from wages and salaries, adjusted for inflation, went from $516 in 1979 down to $471 in 1981, up to $537 in 1988 and then fell precipitously, to $501 today, according to the Labor Department.
Only the 20 percent of American families at the top of the income scale have prospered in recent years. They did so in part because stock dividends and interest from bonds often supplemented salaries. And some jobs -- in medicine, engineering, corporate management, law and on Wall Street, for example -- paid extremely well.
 
Lucky Them
 The real median income of these lucky families rose year after year to $92,663 from $73,764 in 1981. Such gains in the 1980's were two or three times greater than those of less wealthy families, and alone among Americans the top 20 percent finished the decade with real incomes well above their earnings in 1973.
Economists offer many explanations for the income stagnation that has plagued the nation. The decline in union power is high on the list. As factories have been modernized and jobs lost, millions of assembly line workers have taken lower-paying jobs in the service sector. Many companies, in addition, have chosen to shift production overseas rather than raise wages at home. And the pressure on employers to raise wages is disappearing as a recession develops and unemployment rises. For many workers, keeping a job has priority over getting a raise.
Perhaps more important, the once widely accepted concept of raising wages to offset inflation is fading. Instead, workers' wages are tied increasingly to their employers' fortunes. Instead of cost-of-living raises, thousands of companies now give their workers a share of profits or bonuses tied to profits. Under this system, when profits shrink in hard times, like now, income can stagnate or decline, regardless of inflation.
 
Productivity Problems
 Beyond these trends in labor-management relations, a more ingrained problem holds down pay, many economists argue. Neither wages nor profits can rise very much if productivity fails to go up; that is, if workers fail to produce more goods or turn out more work in a given day or week, thus failing to generate the extra revenue to pay for wage increases and also to fatten profits.
Overall productivity is indeed rising much more slowly than in the 1960's, helping to explain wage stagnation. But the huge manufacturing sector is a glaring exception. Largely through automation and new production practices, productivity in manufacturing rose by 4 percent or more a year through most of the 1980's. At the same time, median wages declined in real terms for millions of factory workers, falling to $8 an hour from $8.65 in 1985.
What happened to the extra money that, in theory, should have resulted from the much higher productivity? Very little wound up in the profit column, suggesting to Mr. Bosworth at Brookings that the productivity gains never fully materialized. The ever more efficient production of small computers, he says, accounts for most of the productivity improvement in manufacturing. But when companies try to use the computers to increase the efficiency of car manufacturing or operating an office, they make little headway.
Whatever the merits of this argument, wages and incomes are not growing. The liveliest economic expansion since the 1920's failed to step up Americans' income. As Mr. Bosworth puts it, "We are wiping out the income gains of the mid-80's at virtually all levels of society, except the very top."

Adding Up the World Trade Talks: Fail Now, Pay Later

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
AFTER four years of debate over how many dairy cows can dance on the head of a subsidy, the 107-nation negotiation aimed at lowering trade barriers has broken down.
But the resulting crisis is an abstraction: Ships bearing all those cars and computers and soybeans will still be able to unload in Seattle, Rotterdam and Yokahama for the foreseeable future. The most visible result appeared to be relief on the part of world leaders, who will no longer be pressed to exact concessions from potent domestic interests in the name of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also known as the General Agreement to Talk and Talk. 
 The lack of an immediate bang, however, does not mean that the whimper will not eventually be felt around the globe. The talks -- which may resume eventually -- broke down over agriculture, but that was only part of what was at stake in Brussels. Gary Hufbauer, an economist at Georgetown University, reckons that at very least the failure represents a lost opportunity to expand world trade by about $300 billion annually. Of that total, roughly 20 percent represents pure productivity gain -- an increase in output requiring no extra input of labor or capital or natural resources.
And to Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University, that is only the tip of the iceberg. The failure at Brussels, he argues, is an invitation to tiptoe away from the liberal trading system that made the West rich and offers the best hope for smashing poverty in the world's have-not nations.
The current round of negotiations was born of fear and opportunism in 1985. Reagan Administration free traders, increasingly on the defensive against a protectionist-minded Congress, sought to build a coalition of business interests with a big stake in expanding world markets.
Europe was asked to abandon farm subsidies to its 10 million toytown farmers -- subsidies that have transformed the largely infertile, highly urbanized continent into a price-busting food exporter and cost American agriculture billions in exports. Third world countries were asked to respect foreign patents, trademarks and copyrights. And everyone was asked to open the door to trade in services, the fastest growing export sector for affluent countries. Japan, a surprisingly small player in the GATT talks in light of its strong trade position, was insistent that its ban on rice imports remain, but appeared open to other concessions.
 
Give and Take
 For its part, Washington offered to slaughter a few of its own sacred cows. Sugar growers and dairy farmers would be forced to compete with their far more productive counterparts in other countries. Textile and apparel makers would gradually lose the protection of the Multi-Fiber Agreement, a "temporary" restraint on imports from poor countries first imposed in 1974.
With a few exceptions, notes Jeffrey Schott, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, third world countries bought into the deal. And the Bush Administration seemed ready to fight the good fight with Congress, provided it was armed with enough concessions for grain farmers, bankers, insurers, telecommunications companies, software designers and drug firms.
But most nations in the European Community -- France and Italy in particular -- were never enthusiastic about tackling their potent farm lobbies. Unable to reach agreement on farm policies, the talks collapsed, stranding the more forward-looking questions of trade in services and protection of trademarks.
 
At What Cost?
 Figuring out the direct costs of the Brussels fiasco is a messy business, in part because no one expected a successful conclusion to the negotiations to remove every remaining barrier to trade overnight. But a few numbers are suggestive.
William Cline, another economist at the Institute for International Economics, estimates that Americans pay an extra $20 billion a year for clothes because of the quotas on imports from the third world. Protection of America's handful of sugar beet and cane growers, by contrast, costs consumers a mere $1 billion. But the resulting collapse of the sugar industry in some of the poorest countries in the world is nothing short of a disaster. "Losses in sugar," Mr. Hufbauer said, "have totally canceled the benefits of the Caribbean Basin Initiative."
Potential gains from tight enforcement of "intellectual property rights," everything from spreadsheet software royalties to kung fu movie licensing fees, are still harder to pin down. But the Pfizer Corporation, for one, is not shy about publicizing its own accounting. The big pharmaceutical house estimates that it is losing $250 million a year in sales of a single drug, the anti-arthritic agent Feldene. In Brazil, for example, copycat drugs share half the market with Feldene.
These direct losses may pale by comparison with the dynamic losses associated with restraints on global competition. Relatively open access to world markets, dictated by the victorious Americans in the 1940's, was critical to the postwar growth in the industrialized democracies. Those who doubt its current relevance, says Mr. Bhagwati, need only compare the record of export-oriented Asian countries with inward-looking, tightly protectionist India.
Thailand and South Korea, to take two examples, were no better off in the early 1960's than India. Nor is it obvious that they were riper for development -- both were (and are) burdened by enormous military expenditures. But by the late 1980's, Thailand's per capita income was triple that of India's; South Korea was so much richer that the comparison is no longer meaningful.
Failure to eliminate trade barriers in apparel and agriculture, industries where cheap labor is a huge advantage, is bad news for poor countries on the edge of an export-led breakout -- Indonesia, Pakistan, Argentina and Poland come to mind. But to Mr. Bhagwati, the failure to put a stake through the heart of "managed trade" in developed countries is every bit as ominous.
If heavy manufacturing was the engine of growth in the 1950's and 1960's, services and high technology will have to play the role for the next few decades. But without a comprehensive trade deal, it will be very hard to counter the inclination to put protectionist fences around productivity-enhancing competition.
For example, attempts to protect America's machine tool industry from Japanese competitors were barely beaten back in the early 1980's. Those lower-cost computerized imports ended up helping to spruce up Rust Belt industries. And only in the last year have electronics manufacturers given up the fight to subsidize development of a uniquely American system for high-definition television -- protection that the author George Gilder believes would have locked the industry into instantly obsolete technology.
 
Protectionism Grows
 Stopping similar protectionist initiatives has grown more difficult since 1988, notes Ronald Cass, dean of the Boston University Law School and the former vice-chairman of the United States International Trade Commission. Before the 1988 trade law, the White House had great discretion in deciding what amounted to unfair trade practices and designing a remedy. Now the President is required to retaliate, giving foreign producers strong incentives to strike their own market-sharing deals with the American rivals.
Those inclined to minimize the brouhaha in Brussels point to the success of regional free trade agreements -- everything from the European Community to the Canada-United States free trade pact. Indeed, Bush Administration spinmasters are already putting new emphasis on the idea of a free trade zone for all the Americas as an alternative to global liberalization.
As the world's largest exporter and the world's largest importer, the United States would make a very solid anchor for a trade zone. But for all the immediate attractions of taking our football and going home, the risks of allowing the globe to break into trading blocks are enormous. Prosperity is built on productivity growth. And the competitive pressure for change where it really counts is coming from Europe and Asia -- not Mexico, Canada or Brazil. Consumers could pay the price for a retreat to the cocoon.
 
WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE STALLED TALKS
 The collapse of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks is of benefit mostly to politically powerful trade sectors that have required Government support to remain competitive. Analysts believe the losses from the collapse will outweigh the gains, and will result in higher prices and lower productivity in both the developed and developing worlds. As things now stand, these would be among the consequences:
 
Some of the winners:
 
French, German and Italian farmers, who could not compete in open markets for meat, grains, sugar and dairy products, will continue to receive government subsidies.
 
Japanese rice farmers, the most heavily protected farmers in the world, will benefit from subsidies and a ban on rice imports.
 
American dairy farmers and sugar growers will continue to receive subsidies.
 
American apparel manufacturers, who cannot automate sufficiently to offset the lower labor costs of Asian and Latin American countries, will benefit from continued quotas on imported clothing.
 
European telephone and airline monopolies, which are far less efficient than potential American competitors.
 
Some of the losers:
 
European and American drug and computer-software companies, whose patents are not protected in the third world.
 
American music and movie companies, which lose royalties to copyright pirates in Asia and Latin America and are threatened by restrictions on European television.
 
Canadian, Australian, Argentine, American and New Zealand grain, oilseed and meat growers, whose export markets are depressed by subsidized European exports.
 
Sugar cane farmers in Central America, the Caribbean and the Philippines, victims of American protectionism and European dumping.
 
American banks, securities brokers and insurance companies, which now face myriad restrictions in most markets.

Economic Gridlock

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The exchange of views (Op-Ed, Oct. 19, and letter, Nov. 28) between George Soros, a Wall Street financier, and Boris Milner, a Soviet economist, points up the struggle between the old guard and a new guard for control of Soviet economic opportunity. Also important is the viability of economic plans, whoever carries them out.
To build marketing institutions is important, but creates a hollow shell without the purchasing power and production from full employment. Both writers seem to miss the fundamental problem of putting the unemployed and the underused to work in the advanced industrial and agricultural machine needed to maintain a market economy.
There is no magic incantation that will put people to work, just because marketing links are built and capital is made available for tooling up factories and farms. The instinct of entrepreneurs is not to hire workers until sales show them they should do so. They don't get the sales until the workers are well employed throughout the economy. Such gridlock must be broken.
Employment must be required by government fiat. The Soviet Union can do this by tying capital grants for machines to mandatory hiring of the numbers of workers needed to bring volumes of goods produced and consumer purchasing into proper balance.

Their Own Fates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New 'S' and old 'U' in U.S.S.R" (editorial, Nov. 28) demonstrates, to use Soviet language, "old thinking," in that it does not take into account changes taking place. The Soviet Union is an empire composed of nations that were forcibly incorporated. Your implicit comparison to American states is highly questionable.
Furthermore, it is not only the Baltic states that never chose to be associated with Moscow. This applies as well to the other republics, as the Soviets themselves are increasingly admitting. Even the Communist-controlled Georgian Supreme Soviet, before the recent elections in which the nationalists won, condemned the forcible Bolshevik takeover of that republic, which enjoyed independence between 1918 and 1921.
It is up to the nations composing the Soviet Union -- Russia, the Ukraine, Armenia, Lithuania and others -- to determine their own fate. The Bush Administration should neither encourage nor yet discourage "many separate Soviet states," but support democratic and peaceful processes. If these processes lead to separate states (that is, if this is a reflection of the will of the people), then so be it!

HEADLINE: What's a Deb to Do in Hard Times? Go to the Ball? Burn Her Dance Card?

BYLINE: By GEORGIA DULLEA

 BODY:
In yet another sign of hard times in gilded circles, the New York debutante quotient is down this season. Some young women whose older sisters were once presented to society at a series of back-to-back balls are curtailing their own curtsies and settling for just one. Other young women are not even coming out but are staying in for the foreseeable future.
"It's not a reflection on whether or not girls want to come out," said Margaret Joyce Hedberg, the director of the 36th annual International Debutante Ball, which will be held at the Plaza on Dec. 29. "It's the economy. All the parties are feeling it this year, although nobody wants to talk about it." 
 Indeed, they do not. Powers behind the 55-year-old New York Debutante Cotillion and Christmas Ball cite a dwindling demographic pool of women of debutante age, generally 18 or 19 years, in explaining why their gathering in the Waldorf-Astoria's Grand Ballroom on Saturday will be "more intimate" than in the recent past.
In any case, the tradition of coming out, which flourished in the 1980's when it became fashionable to display the trappings of wealth and class, seems on the decline. At least this is true in New York, where organizers of balls attended by debutantes from other states love to pick up the telephone and hear a Texas twang.
"You can have a flat economy or even a depression, and you'll still have Texas girls," said Nancy Stith-Williams, who runs another Plaza party, the Debutante Assembly and New Year's Ball, which was started by her mother in 1921. "Texas girls are party girls."
Besides that, the Texas debs are noted for their nose-to-the-floor court bows, unlike New York women, some of whom will be bowing out this year.
The cotillion, which draws its members from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, presented 56 debs last year. This year the number of young women who will be doing dreamy waltzes in long white dresses has dropped to 30. Contrast this with the 80's, when the leaders of this party boasted of waiting lists and presentations of 75 or more women. Now they and others are reluctant to talk about what it takes to launch a daughter into society.
Presentation fees at parties range generally between $1,200 and $2,000. Tickets for family and friends cost about $225 each. Add dresses for the deb and her mother, beauty salon visits, cars, wine at dinner, perhaps a page in the party's journal, raffles and auctions and, parents say, coming-out parties can cost $10,000 or more. This is without the round of lunches and brunches, teas and dinners that go with the territory.
Even parents who would not miss the money shrink from spending it in public this year. "It's tasteless in these times," said a Park Avenue mother who asked not to be identified. It is, of course, more graceful to bow at a charity party like the International, as it is known, which raises money for several causes. Or the cotillion, popularly called the Infirmary ball, which benefits New York Infirmary-Beekman Downtown Hospital.
"If a girl is reluctant to come out, she's at least benefiting the hospital by doing so," said Christina Hoyt Vanderlip, the chairwoman of the cotillion, which was founded by her husband's grandmother, Narcissa Cox Vanderlip.
Mrs. Vanderlip, who came of age in the early 70's, declined to make her debut. "At the time it just wasn't considered cool by a lot of people," she said. "Back then, traditionally the parties were the only way for young women to meet young men. But now they are an opportunity for a wonderful family party."
Despite changing times, tradition endures at the balls, which run from Thanksgiving through New Year's Day. Debs at the International have one military and one civilian escort, and those from other countries often have titles as well, and puzzled expressions. Debs at the Junior League Thanksgiving Eve Ball are presented with green ostrich fans, a symbol of their provisional membership in the group and commitment to do volunteer work after college graduation.
And then there is the intricacy of the cotillion dance. "It's done with garlands and fans and bouquets," said Margot McAnaney, a Harvard freshman who is a chairwoman of the debutante committee. "I'm counting on my long white dress to hide my feet, but don't tell my mom. "
Miss McAnaney, whose parents live in Manhattan, is making her debut at three parties this season. "This type of exercise appears very upper class and old-fashioned and definitely has bad connotations," she said. "But it is not a marriage market. If it was, neither I nor my parents would be connected with it in any way."
What it is, she said, is a chance to dress up, see old friends and meet new ones. "Two generations ago everybody had to do it, and one generation ago nobody wanted to it," Miss McAnaney said, adding that her mother dropped out of the debutante pool. "But now it's very much the girl's decision, and you're not looked down upon either way. "

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Atrocities by Iraqis in Kuwait: Numbers Are Hard to Verify

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Dec. 15

 BODY:
More than four months after Iraq's invasion, Kuwaitis are being subjected to looting, rape, torture and executions, human rights groups, Kuwaiti exiles and other witnesses say. But estimates of the frequency and extent of the abuses are so sharply disputed that the human rights groups, and even some Kuwaitis, say that given the lack of access to Kuwait, they cannot evaluate the remaining population's plight with any certainty.
Kuwait and its supporters say at least 7,000 Kuwaitis have been killed and 25,000 arrested or detained since Iraqi troops invaded the country on Aug. 2. By contrast, Middle East Watch, an independent human rights group based in New York, puts the death toll at about 1,000, and arrests and detentions at 5,000, some 3,000 of whom are still being held. 
 Amnesty International, the London-based human rights monitors, confirmed deaths "in the scores" and arrests and detentions "in the hundreds" in its last report on Kuwait in early October. And while the group is issuing a new report on Wednesday, Amnesty representatives say their estimates are slightly higher than but roughly similar to those of Middle East Watch.
 
Exaggeration Suspected
 The vast discrepancies in the estimates have given rise to suspicions among some human rights monitors that abuses are being exaggerated, consciously or not, for political purposes. Several human rights monitors said in interviews that they believed that the Bush Administration and Kuwait and its supporters are relying on reports of atrocities to help counter lawmakers, former government officials and foreign policy analysts who favor waiting for economic sanctions to force Iraqi soldiers out of Kuwait.
"My country is being savaged and destroyed, our women subjected to mass acts of rape, our men and even children are being murdered while these armchair analysts advocate waiting a year or up to 18 months for sanctions to force him out," Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, Kuwait's Ambassador to the United States, said in an unusually emotional outburst during a recent interview. "Those who favor letting us suffer might at very least consider calling upon Iraq to permit a human rights observer force to enter Kuwait -- which they have refused to do -- to protect our people there."
Human rights groups agree that atrocities are being committed under Iraqi occupation. And they second Sheik Saud's call for greater access to Kuwait. But they add that given Iraq's refusal to permit on-site inspections in Kuwait by humanitarian groups, they cannot confirm many of reports of "mass acts" of rape, torture and execution coming from Kuwaiti sources.
"As a human rights organization, we deplore and would never want to minimize the grave human rights abuses taking place in Kuwait," said Andrew Whitley, director of Middle East Watch. "But neither do we wish to see them overstated or exaggerated in an exercise to whip up war fever."
Iraq has repeatedly denied committing atrocities in Kuwait. But it has also refused to permit journalists or human rights monitors to visit Kuwait to conduct unsupervised interviews and assessments. Moreover, Baghdad has argued that because Kuwait is part of Iraq, it is not bound by the 1949 Geneva Conventions governing rules of war and treatment of prisoners and civilian populations.
 
Propaganda Value Cited
 What is not disputed is the propaganda value of Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait, where 400,000 people, 200,000 of them Kuwaiti, are struggling to survive under rapidly deteriorating conditions, including scarcity of food and virtually no medicine. The Kuwaiti Government in exile has sent missions across the United States and Europe to highlight these conditions and atrocities.
The day before the Security Council voted to authorize the use of force to evict Iraq from Kuwait after Jan. 15, Kuwait made an unusual and moving presentation to the Council on human rights abuses committed by the Iraqi authorities. Using videotaped testimony and giant blowups of photos of torture victims, exiled Kuwaitis told a stunned and silent Security Council about the horrors they said Iraqi soldiers were inflicting on the Kuwaiti people.
President Bush, who has likened Saddam Hussein to Hitler, has said Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait are partly responsible for his unwillingness to rely on sanctions to force Iraq out.
 
Rape Case Is Described
 Iraq's sensitivity to reports of atrocities -- and its ideas about how best to counter such accounts -- were reflected in a recent cablegram filed by an American diplomat in the region.
According to an unidentified woman who recently left Saudi Arabia, the cablegram recounts, Iraqi soldiers recently raped a Kuwaiti woman from a prominent family and her two daughters in their fashionable home in a Kuwaiti suburb. Iraqi troops subsequently returned with one of the rapists and announced that a Kuwaiti male member of the family "would be given a gun to execute the rapist in front of television cameras," the cablegram says.
Residents of the area believed that the rape was "staged deliberately in order to arrive at this end point -- a film that can be used to counter the tales of atrocities coming out of Kuwait by showing that the occupation authorities are taking decisive action."
In its last report, Amnesty International said that based on scores of interviews with refugees, it had found a "horrifying picture of widespread arrests, torture under interrogation, summary executions, and mass extrajudicial killings."
Few informed observers disagree. What is at issue, however, is the number of victims.
 
250 Executions Confirmed
 "Yes, what's happening in Kuwait is terrible and completely unacceptable," said Aziz Abu Hamad, a Saudi who conducted many of the more than 600 interviews used in compiling Middle East Watch's detailed 18-page report, issued in November. "But we simply cannot find persuasive evidence of the thousands of deaths and mass rapes and many of the other abuses on a scale that have been reported in the press."
For instance, he said, he could confirm only about 250 of what Kuwait says were thousands of summary executions.
Kuwaiti officials have said Iraq is trying to re-populate their country with Iraqi citizens. But Mr. Aziz and Mr. Whitley said they could not find evidence to support this.
While there were some Iraqis who had moved down to join husbands who were soldiers, the Government did not seem to be encouraging a substantial migration, they said. On Nov. 26, they noted, Iraq's Interior Ministry ordered all Iraqi families living in Kuwait to return to Iraq and barred Iraqis from moving to Kuwait.
 
'Generalized' Rape Unconfirmed
 A far more sensitive area of disagreement is the issue of rape. Administration and Kuwaiti officials have deplored what one senior American official recently called "the culture of rape" under Iraqi occupation. But Mr. Whitley said that although there is no doubt that many women and even girls have been raped, his group could not confirm "rape as a generalized phenomenon."
A Kuwaiti obstetrician who was brought to the United States by Citizens for a Free Kuwait, a lobbying group, said she had treated four cases of rape in three and a half months of work at Maternity Hospital in Kuwait City. "It appears to be frequent, but not that frequent," she said.
What particularly disturbed her, she added, was the difference in the rapes she had treated soon after the invasion and then last month. She treated the first two women in August, she said. Both were married women who were not Kuwaiti, and both had been picked up on the street by Iraqi soldiers. But in early November, she treated two Kuwaiti girls, both unmarried, who had been raped by soldiers who had entered their home at 5 A.M.
"The male members of the family were taken to the first floor of the house and subjected to mock executions, while the girls were raped below them," she said, asking that her name be withheld to protect relatives still in Kuwait. "Their parents could hear their screams but not help them."
Anita Tiessen a spokeswoman for Amnesty International in London, said that though rape reports were increasing recently, they were particularly difficult to document in a country like Kuwait, in which women were expected to be virgins when they married. "The shame of the event means there is likely to be a lot of underreporting," she said.
 
'Lower Estimates Often Correct'
 Human rights groups are the first to acknowledge that their estimates are conservative. "It makes a better headline to use the larger numbers," said Kenneth Roth, deputy director of Human Rights Watch, of which Middle East Watch is an affiliate. "But we find that the lower estimates often prove correct, so to maintain credibility, we report only what we can confirm."
"The situation in Kuwait makes 'Rashomon' look like a clear story," he concluded. "Without direct access to the country, it is very hard to be sure."
What seems sure, however, is that hundreds of people have been executed -- more by the security police and military intelligence than by soldiers -- in detention centers, in public, or in front of their families.
An Administration official said human rights monitors in the Government tended to believe the human rights groups' estimates rather than those of the Kuwaiti Government.
"We can't accuse them of lying," the official said. "But this is a highly emotional situation, and it's very hard to be cool and objective."
Atrocity reports inolving occupied territories have frequently been incorrect. In 1914, for example, the Germans were falsely accused by the Allies of murdering Belgian babies at the outset of World War I; in World War II many diplomats said reports of German atrocities against the Jews were exaggerated.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 30, 1990, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Dec. 16 discussed reports of Iraqi atrocities in occupied Kuwait. The article noted that reports of atrocities in occupied territories have frequently proved incorrect.
It concluded: "In 1914, for example, the Germans were falsely accused by the Allies of murdering Belgian babies at the outset of World War I; in World War II many diplomats said reports of German atrocities against the Jews were exaggerated."
The passage was ambiguous; it should have made clear that it was the diplomats who were wrong in understating the magnitude of the Nazi genocide, in which six million Jews were killed.

HEADLINE: Divided Loyalties

BYLINE: By Joel Brinkley; Joel Brinkley is Jerusalem bureau chief of The Times.

 BODY:
AS CROWN PRINCE HASSAN LOOKS ON, hands in his pockets, 200 college students wearing the distinctive brown uniforms of the Jordanian Popular Army are marching through their drills on the Jordan University soccer field. The sun is low, and the long afternoon shadows sharpen the sense of theater as the exuberant young men and women writhe on their bellies across the Astroturf, pretending to crawl through enemy gunfire. Others thrust their AK-47 assault rifles at imaginary Israeli paratroopers, screaming war cries with every jab.
The Prince watches, distracted, and doesn't react when the boys shout their guttural chant: "God, land, country, King! Jordan, Jordan, Jordan!"
For Hassan -- the 43-year-old brother of King Hussein and heir to the throne -- this brief afternoon visit to the campus in Amman is not just another in a long day of princely duties. No, for the Prince and the 55-year-old King, the Popular Army is a potent, painful symbol of the yawning chasm splitting Jordanian society. It threatens to engulf the state.
After watching silently for a moment, the Prince glances around and then idly asks a university official, "Do you have squash courts here?" 
 The Prince and the King agreed to mobilize a civilian militia a few weeks ago, even though the Jordanian Government has too few weapons to arm the recruits, not enough cash to pay for their training and no clear military mission for them once trained.
It was the rulers' compromise answer to the angry, threatening cry from Palestinian citizens, about half of Jordan's 3.2 million people. After the Israeli police killed at least 17 Arabs at Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem in October, Jordan's Palestinians wanted the Jordanian Government to hand out firearms so they could "face the Zionist enemy."
"We are ready to fight anyone, kill anyone -- Israelis, Americans," says 20-year-old Selwa Farhan, green eyes burning, as she steps off the practice field.
The request for weapons was refused. With profound understatement, King Hussein said that "it will take a bit of time" before the Government can arm the Palestinians, who once tried to kill him and take over the country. Instead, the militiamen train with weapons but aren't allowed to take them home. So, in essence, the royal brothers mobilized all male and many female Jordanians between the ages of 15 and 55 just to calm down the Palestinians.
"It was just sort of an emotional thing," says Gen. Abdul Hadi Majali, former Chief of Staff of the regular Jordanian Army. "Of course, these people don't really have any understanding of the military balance."
This was one more costly concession to the people who have presented King Hussein with his most consistent and dangerous challenge since the moment he took the throne of the Hashemite kingdom 37 years ago. Now, with the gulf crisis, the Palestinians seem intent on dragging Jordan into political and economic ruin, if not into war. Though these refugees from Palestine are full citizens of Jordan, most of them hold allegiance to only one thing: the drive to regain their homeland, now the nation of Israel. Without pause, they say they would sacrifice the kingdom in the process.
Since August, the Palestinians -- "the street," as Prince Hassan and others often refer to them -- have become loud promoters of Saddam Hussein because of his bellicose support for their cause. Not even the bitter stories from the Palestinian workers who have been forced to flee Kuwait, stripped of their life's savings, have done much to alter the prevailing view.
At the same time, native Jordanians, while sympathetic, are despairing that the Palestinians have been allowed to set the nation's tone -- destroying its reputation, and with it the economy. Watching this, the royal brothers have seemed unwilling, or unable, to stop the process.
"I suppose we could have done more," Prince Hassan reluctantly acknowledges.
This November afternoon, as the women's corps marches to the staccato cadence of a drillmaster, a young woman approaches the Prince with a question. Her worried tone belies her polite smile.
"If Israel is handing out arms to all of its citizens," she asks, voicing a popular but inaccurate Palestinian belief, "why aren't Jordanians being given weapons, too?"
Prince Hassan frowns with frustration.
"This isn't a practical question," he snaps back. And in an interview later, he explains that the whole issue of the growing Palestinian militancy had him and his brother deeply concerned.
"The street agenda is totally different from what you and I look at," he says. "It is this Lebanonization of Jordan that I find so worrying. I don't know where it might lead."

EVEN WITH THEIR INSURGENT VIEWS, THE Palestinians are important members of Jordanian society. Large numbers of them have been in Jordan since the nation was founded more than 40 years ago. Today they are the merchants, businessmen and professionals. As a group they are highly educated. And though thousands still live in sprawling but relatively orderly refugee camps largely concentrated outside Amman, most live in the cities; some 70 percent of Amman's residents are of Palestinian origin.
Though Palestinians possess much of the nation's wealth, the native Jordanians hold most of the political control. The true natives are descendants of Bedouin tribesmen. But others who were born in Jordan are considered natives, too, though their parents or grandparents immigrated from other Arab nations. Now this group is dominant in government and the military.
The Jordanians, by and large, want a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis. Though many of them, including the royal brothers, admire Saddam Hussein and have little love for the exiled Kuwaiti rulers, they also say Iraq should pull out of Kuwait and the American forces should leave Saudi Arabia. That fence-straddling position is out of concert with the Western view, but still not overtly hostile, American officials say. Though the United States occasionally expresses irritation with King Hussein, relations remain "decent," as one American official put it. Among Jordanians, in fact, the King is often regarded as the most pro-American Arab leader, particularly since his wife, Queen Noor, is American.
At the same time, however, many of Jordan's Palestinians are not only openly hostile to the United States, they also want a war.
The Iraqi President should not only keep Kuwait, they say, but roll his tanks into Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, and retake the land they still call Palestine. At countless demonstrations, the Palestinians have called for the overthrow, or death, of American, Egyptian and Saudi leaders.
On the day Prince Hassan watched the Popular Army drill, he also addressed a faculty and student group. A single exchange defined the clash of views.
"Our stand against the occupation and annexation of Kuwait is clear," the Prince said. "Since the beginning, Jordan has called for an Arab settlement. This is important because without it we might have only a few days, a few weeks before disastrous war." The audience listened quietly. Then the Prince took questions. Ibrahim Zaid Al Kilani, dean of the religious faculty, stood up and lectured the Prince. The dean's family comes from the West Bank city of Nablus.
"We need to prepare all the people for a jihad and turn Jordan into one big battlefield," he said. His eyes bore down on the Prince. "A great man once said, 'Now is the time to die.' And now is the best time to die."
A deadpan "thank you" was the Prince's only reply.
Al Kilani is not only of Palestinian origin, he is also an Islamic fundamentalist. For the last several years Jordanians have worried about the rapid spread of fundamentalism, and that concern seemed to overshadow the anxiety about the nation's Palestinians.
But as the last few months have shown, Jordan's Islamic fundamentalists are, for the most part, Palestinian. They find that the Islamic call for a jihad to retake Jerusalem and the holy land fits neatly into their pre-existing world view. So secular and fundamentalist Palestinians have joined together in a loud cry for war.
"The brotherhood of Islam, they're all Palestinians," says Abdallah Abdel Fatah Turky, an egg merchant in Baka, a bustling Palestinian refugee camp outside Amman. "The thing we all want the most is a war -- a war against Israel, a war against America."
From the first moment in August, King Hussein and Prince Hassan have tried to convince the world that their position -- they've enforced the sanctions against Iraq, while calling for a diplomatic, not military, solution -- is Jordan's. They have given more speeches and interviews in the last four months than in the previous four years.
Still, the Palestinians have been louder. Their bellicose rhetoric drowned out the official line, and it didn't take long before much of the world came to believe that the Palestinian position was Jordan's.
That perception alienated nearly all of Jordan's friends, allies and trading partners. The country had already lost one-quarter of its export markets by supporting the international sanctions against Iraq and Kuwait.
But a few weeks later, most of the rest of Jordan's exports, along with tourism, foreign aid and expatriate labor markets, were cut off as well. Jordan's neighbors, led by Saudi Arabia, ended almost all trade and commerce, so angered were they by what they saw as Jordan's pro-Iraq tilt. That eliminated almost every source of foreign income. So now Jordan is teetering on the edge of political and economic ruin.
"The reality is that we are in a very serious predicament," the King said in an interview in his office at the Royal Palace. "More serious than we ever faced until now."

IN A LAW OFFICE A few miles away from the Royal Palace, Yousef Hamden, a prosperous 38-year-old Palestinian lawyer who grew up near Nablus, agrees with that assessment. But he doesn't seem concerned.
Hamden holds Jordanian citizenship, voted in the elections last year and has lived in Amman with his family for the last eight years. Dressed in a white shirt and gray silk necktie, hair carefully coiffed, he leans forward in a high-back leather chair behind a rosewood desk. But Palestinian rage burns just below his proper establishment surface. "I have never felt Jordanian -- never," he says. "You wouldn't find even a small percentage of Palestinians in Jordan who wouldn't prefer to live in their own land. We have been humiliated for too long."
Hamden has left work several times to march in Palestinian demonstrations of support for Saddam Hussein. He particularly remembers the day that 15,000 people gathered in Mafraq.
"We sacrifice our blood for you, Saddam!" a Palestinian member of Parliament told the cheering throngs. "Let's hit the Americans, let's hit the Saudis! The time for war has arrived."
If Palestinian support for Iraq drags Jordan into ruin, Hamden says, "Well then the people will live as we lived in Palestine. Let them go back to the old life. Life will be hard, but our dignity will be intact."
In Aqaba, a resort town on the Red Sea, a hotelier, a native Jordanian, is not so sure he agrees.
William Sawalha and Jill Balchin, the assistant manager, are sitting beside the swimming pool of his hotel, the Alcazar, all by themselves at the height of the tourist season. The hotel's lobby is empty. So is the restaurant and the bar and the discotheque.
"We have 152 rooms," Balchin says. After a pause, she adds, "We have three guests just now."
"No," Sawalha corrects her, "they checked out." The gulf crisis, he goes on, is "a complete disaster for us, for the whole industry, for Jordan." Soon, he says, he will have to close his hotel.
How does he think Jordan got into this predicament? The Palestinians, he says, "put the King in a situation where he is forced to take a position."
Sawalha considers for a moment. "Look, we sympathize," he says. "The Palestinians are our relatives, our friends. But you can't close your eyes to the other things that are happening, too."

IF HE STOPPED TO THINK about it, King Hussein might agree that his grandfather, King Abdullah, is largely to blame for his current troubles. Abdullah saddled Jordan with the Palestinian problem.
As a leader of the Arab revolt against the Turks in World War I, Abdullah had hoped the British would reward him with a new kingdom -- Iraq, perhaps, or Syria. It turned out that both were already taken. But the British had another idea: why didn't Abdullah become King of Trans-Jordan, then just a desert wasteland, home to warring nomads. Abdullah was not particularly keen on the idea. For centuries, his Hashemite family had ruled the Hejaz, an area of what is now Saudi Arabia that includes Mecca and Medina. But when the British backed the Saud family's claim to the region, the Hashemites had to find a new kingdom. In the end, Abdullah accepted the British offer, apparently embracing the wisdom of his brother Feisal, the new King of Iraq, who wrote that "the wisest course is to take everything we can take and wait for tomorrow, because the nights are pregnant and might give birth to miracles."
Sitting in the scruffy little desert village of Amman in the 1920's, Abdullah yearned for a miracle that would give him control of Jerusalem, then part of British Mandate Palestine. Abdullah bided his time, and when the British pulled out in 1948, Jordan joined the war against the new Jewish state. When it was over, Abdullah held half of Jerusalem and the area now known as the West Bank -- all that was left of what the United Nations had designated as the new Palestinian state that was supposed to be born alongside Israel.
Abdullah annexed the region, quashing the Palestinians' dream of a land of their own, and Palestinian resentment grew. On June 21, 1951, a Palestinian assassinated the King as he entered Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem. His grandson, Hussein, stood beside him.
Hussein's father, Talal, a schizophrenic, took the throne but was forced to abdicate only a year later. Hussein was crowned at age 17, already wary of the bitter Palestinian refugees who populated his country. To avert more trouble, the young King quickly adopted a light-handed style of rule. He was the consensus King, the leader of all his people.

IN 1967, HUSSEIN MADE what may have been the worst decision of his life. He entered the Arabs' war against Israel -- tricked by Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt into believing victory was near, when in fact the Arabs were already defeated.
The Jordanian Army fought credibly but was overwhelmed by the far superior Israeli force. And with defeat, Hussein lost Jerusalem and the West Bank. As if that were not humiliation enough, he also gained tens of thousands of additional Palestinians. So many West Bank refugees poured across the cease-fire line that now half of Jordan's people were Palestinian. Out of both conviction and political necessity, the consensus King quickly adopted the Palestinians' cause as his own and argued their case at every opportunity.
Months later, Hussein gave his tacit assent as Palestine Liberation Organization militias, many led by the radical leaders George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh, began using Jordan as a base for guerrilla and terrorist operations. Gradually Hussein lost control. Then on Sept. 1, 1970, the Palestinians tried to assassinate him. They were trying to take over the state.
Historians and others still wonder why Hussein waited so long to face up to the Palestinian militias. Most attribute it to his longstanding distaste for confrontation. Some call it timidity. But eventually he ordered the army to act. In September 1970, after fierce fighting and dozens of deaths during what came to be known as Black September, Habash, Hawatmeh and the other Palestinian guerrillas were routed and expelled.

GEORGE HABASH'S stubby brush of hair is grayer today, and he walks with a pronounced limp, the result of a stroke. But as he makes his way down the carpeted aisle of Amman's Royal Cultural Center with Nayef Hawatmeh at his side -- 20 years to the month after Black September -- the packed hall of several thousand Palestinian followers erupts with cheers andchants. "With our blood, with our souls, we will fight for you."
Neither man had set foot in Jordan since he was expelled. And in that time Amman had grown into a bright, clean and wealthy city of wide boulevards, expansive suburbs and fashionable homes. Most of it was built with Palestinian money, earned working in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia or the other gulf states.
On the streets, the Palestinian bankers and lawyers are hardly distinguishable from the Jordanian civil servants and Government officials. They all wear dark European-cut suits and drive Mercedes-Benzes, if they can, or other late-model cars. The Palestinian women, many wearing veils and long, simple dresses, stand out more often, a reflection of the growing Islamic fundamentalism that has taken hold in Jordan, mostly among the Palestinians.
The country is also partly democratic now. The press is freer, and public expression is rarely limited. And at the end of last year the royal brothers allowed parliamentary elections. The Parliament is free to pass any bill it likes dealing with domestic policy. But the King maintains veto power and also exercises complete control over foreign and military affairs.
For many Palestinians, the natural next step in the democratic evolution was to ask the royal brothers if Habash and Hawatmeh could return. The occasion arose when Arab nationalists, chiefly Palestinians, decided to hold a conference in Amman to show their support for Iraq. When the request came in, several factors weighed on the King's mind.

SIX WEEKS INTO THE gulf crisis, in mid-September, Hussein had never been more popular with his people. His refusal to join the alliance against Iraq raised his standing even among the once-hostile Palestinians. On most every available wall space, they had hung new posters showing the King and Saddam Hussein standing confidently before the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem -- a montage suggesting that the two would soon take the city back.
"It's amazing," an experienced diplomat said of the King. "The number of people willing to go out there and fall on a hand grenade for him now is legion."
Jordan's international standing was weakened, but the King's fence-straddling had limited the damage. In fact, in the late days of August Saudi Arabia suddenly agreed to supply Jordan with one million barrels of oil a month, to compensate for the declining supply from Iraq.
Then came the matter of Habash and Hawatmeh. The two had a long history of hijackings and other assorted terrorist operations. And there was talk that one or the other might agree to carry out attacks for Saddam Hussein. Would the royal brothers let them in? The issue was seen as a clear measure of where Jordan stood.
The King says he did not equivocate. "I decided they were quite welcome," he said, "in the same spirit that I have approached similar problems earlier on." Over the years he has allowed several former enemies to return.
But Prince Hassan recalls deeper thinking. "It was within the rights of the authorities to say they can't come back," he said. "But look at our population. We have a very high percentage of young people. There was a feeling that keeping them out would just add to their mystique."
General Majali, the former Chief of Staff, remembered his alarm. "We shouldn't have been letting them come back as heroes," he said. "We should have let them come back to stand trial."
The September day before the conference began, the organizers announced that King Hussein had agreed to give the opening address, apparently to welcome the two guerrilla leaders. When word of that was made public, the American Embassy warned the King that he'd better not. Instead, he sent the Speaker of the House.
As soon as the conference opened, it turned into a hatefest.
"Our people feel deep and justified hatred against the United States," the first speaker said. The angry oratory grew darker as the day proceeded.
The next morning, a Monday, King Hussein agreed to meet with Habash and Hawatmeh at the Royal Palace.
"They asked for an audience, and I agreed," he said with a shrug. The two Palestinians later described the session as "warm and cordial."
That afternoon, the conference released a statement appealing to Egyptian, Saudi and Syrian troops to "rebel against their leaderships."
On Tuesday, the State Department said it was "surprised and dismayed" that King Hussein had allowed the conference to go on.
Then on Wednesday, the word came from Saudi Arabia: King Fahd was cutting off Jordan's oil. Within days, the Saudis had also expelled a group of Jordanian diplomats, sent thousands of Jordanian workers home and ordered a trade embargo. Saudi Arabia had been Jordan's largest industrial and agricultural trading partner, and now the nation's difficult situation had suddenly become "a very, very serious problem," as Finance Minister Basil Jardeneh put it.
Back at the conference, the chief organizer, Mamdouh Abbadi, was not apologetic. "When you believe in what you are doing," he said, "you don't think about the consequences."

THE TRUCKERS' YARD AT the Saudi crossing is only half full of tractor-trailers, and it's easy to pick out the few Jordanian rigs. They are the ones whose drivers are spitting mad as they walk around their trucks, trying to repair damage done by official vandals on the other side of the border.
"Look at this! Look at this!" Issa Okla howls, pointing to several rough gashes torn in the side of his trailer. "When the Saudis see my Jordanian plates, they get down and spit on them!" the 29-year-old driver says, gesticulating wildly. "They tear holes in the roof, and then when it rains, the vegetables rot. Look at this. Just look!"
Nearby, 30-year-old Mohammed Mahmoud is calmer, but sullen, as he points out the repairs he has just made in his rig:
"When I pass through, the Saudis say: 'You Jordanian dog. You dog. Your father's a dog!' Then they make me unload everything so they can search. By the time they finish, it's been three days. The vegetables are rotten."
Other drivers walk past the Jordanians without remark. They are Syrians or Turks, and for every Jordanian here, 20 of these foreigners are just passing through the country on their way to Saudi Arabia. They are busy taking over the markets the Jordanians have been forced to abandon.
The few Jordanian truckers are trying to make their way to Bahrain or the other tiny gulf states -- barely significant customers, but the only ones left. Even then, the Saudi authorities are giving them so much trouble that only about half the trucks get through.
"They tell us it's because Jordan is not taking the same stand as they are," Achmed Said says as he leans against his radiator, arms crossed. "But I tell them I'm with Saddam because he is taking a straight line for the Arabs. I'm willing to sacrifice anything for Saddam. Even my children." He points back over his shoulder. "Even my truck."
Several other Jordanian truckers -- all Palestinian -- gather around. A Jordanian customs official and a security officer drift up, too.
"We'd rather die with dignity than give in," Okla says. "I'd sacrifice anything for Saddam, anything. Even Jordan."
The customs official bristles at that.
"Ignorant, ignorant," he spits. "What do you know? You have no honor!"
Shaking his head, the Jordanian security officer, Khalil Nahan, walks back to his office.
"Did you hear that dog a while ago?" Nahan complains to a colleague. "He's willing to sacrifice Jordan for Saddam." Nahan heads back toward the door. "I'm going to go get his passport. Hassle him some." But then he changes his mind and sits back down.
"Those Palestinians," Nahan mutters, "they never appreciate anything." He shakes his head. "You can't really blame the Saudis, considering what the Palestinians are doing."

IT'S EARLY ON A Thursday in November, and five Palestinians have just sneaked across the Israeli border from Jordan. In the darkness, they start hiking toward Jerusalem. Each carries a knife, a pistol and a copy of the Koran.
A short time later, a jeep load of Israeli soldiers is on patrol along the wide sand strip that runs the entire length of the border's fence. They study the dirt track ahead. Behind them, the jeep drags a wide rack, smoothing the sand again. Suddenly they stop. Several sets of footprints are visible in the dirt just ahead. One soldier makes a hurried radio call.
Helicopters and troops start the urgent search. Soon the Palestinians are spotted on the edge of a banana grove, walking west. Troops arrive. There's a gun battle. An Israeli soldier is killed. So is a Palestinian. The others are captured, and it turns out that they were on their way to Al Aksa Mosque, intent on revenge. The Israeli Government reacts angrily. It's the 10th guerrilla infiltration from Jordan this year.
Across the Jordan River the next morning, in a mosque just outside Amman, Sheik Abdul Minem Abu Zant, a Palestinian refugee from Nablus and an elected member of the Jordanian Parliament, is delivering his sermon to several hundred members of his congregation, all Palestinians.
"The five who crossed over to Palestine yesterday are the blessed youths of the Islamic battlefield," he says. "This is a miracle." His voice swells. "They are now the dearest ones to the Prophet. What a blessed and pure mission. They carried the Koran with them."
Other fundamentalists offer similar messages in other mosques. The following Tuesday morning, a 17-year-old Palestinian sneaks across the Israeli border and crawls up to an army post. He draws his pistol, shoots and kills an Israeli soldier. Other soldiers capture him. They find that he's carrying the Koran.
Now angry Israelis are talking about using greater force on the border, possibly even retaliation, though King Hussein claims that "we've always tried to keep our border under control."
And with this, still another of Jordan's neighbors is fed up.
It used to be that Sheik Abu Zant would carry a blanket with him to the mosque each Friday. Inflammatory sermons are illegal in Jordan, and so as soon as he stepped down from the pulpit he'd pick up the blanket to take with him when the police carted him away to jail. It was the routine.
But for the last year, since democratization began, no one has bothered him. Fridays, he can say whatever he wants. This is democracy, the royal brothers say.
The Israelis have their own view. In a secure office at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv, an Israeli general gestures to the colonel sitting beside him.
"The colonel will brief you," he tells a half-dozen foreign journalists summoned for a briefing. A large photograph of Jerusalem's Old City hangs like a trophy on the wall.
"Jordan is in a very shaky position," the colonel is saying. "There's a big question about the King's future."
The general takes over a moment later.
"It's true that the Islamic groups are getting stronger," he says, glancing at his notes. "It's a very powerful influence on the regime. Within the walls of the palace, I think they realize that so long as they and the street see things the same way, there will be no real threat to the future of the regime."
The general looks up as he says: "But there is no way, in my opinion, for the long run that they can continue to see eye to eye. There are questions about the future."

SOME JORDANIANS are beginning to ask questions about the present. They wonder why the King allowed things to slide so far.
"The Government had a reasonable position," a former Prime Minister says. "But what happened, unfortunately, is that this reasonable position was swamped, drowned by groups that don't have any allegiance to the King or the regime."
Angrily, he adds, "The regime has allowed itself to be swallowed by the other camp because it didn't have the backbone to stop them."
In response, Government officials say it would be hypocritical to boast that Jordan is growing more democratic -- and then to quash freedom of expression.
"In a democracy, don't these people on the street have the right to say what they think?" Trade Minister Ziad Fariz asks.
In the end, many Jordanians acknowledge that their rulers don't yet fully understand democracy, don't know how to counter dissident voices without actually suppressing them.
Leila Sharaf, who is on a commission to draft a constitutional revision, says: "We instituted democracy too fast. We haven't even passed the laws in Parliament yet to regulate democratic life."
In fact, a year after the national elections last November, political parties are still illegal, probably because the royal brothers fear that someone might form a King's party. What if it lost? That danger was dramatized last month when an Islamic fundamentalist defeated King Hussein's own candidate for speaker of the house.
Political parties may be legalized soon, the King says. But by refusing to legalize them until now, the royal brothers crippled their own supporters. The only people who could organize during the tumult of the last few months were those who had pre-existing issues like Palestinian nationalism or Islamic fundamentalism to unite them. The native Jordanians whose principal affiliations are to country and King had no organized way to promote their beliefs.
"If there had been political parties, there would have been a way to separate between the Palestinian view and the East Bank view," Sharaf contends. But as it stands, General Majali complains, the native Jordanians remain "a silent majority."
The King blames his people for this, at least in part.
"It's up to these people who call themselves the silent majority to wake up to their responsibilities to represent their stands," he said with stiff-lipped certainty. "Many don't take part in the process. When things go wrong, they say the King will resolve it. This has not been the right approach, and I hope they have learned a lesson from it."
What about the King's own duties?
"Well, sir," he said, "I think the responsibility of the Government and the leadership is to articulate itself clearly, and I have done so." After a moment, he also acknowledged that, when this proved insufficient, he called the nation's newspaper editors and columnists in for a private talk.
"I told them, 'Please do not go down to the level that others have reached in addressing this crisis in terms of individuals' -- like King Fahd and President Bush -- 'and in terms of positions that are not helpful to Jordan.' And I think their stand has been on a higher plane than some."
Did he ever consider speaking to some Palestinian leaders, too?
"I could not do more," the King said, "nor would I."
Was it lack of "backbone," as the former Prime Minister put it? Was it timidity born of long and difficult experience with the Palestinians that deterred the royal brothers from doing more?
Prince Hassan, without referring to himself or his brother directly, does acknowledge that the loud Palestinian voices "have made the people become a little timid."
And King Hussein also argues that if he had quieted the Palestinians, or even argued with them in public, "I believe there would have been an eruption. We would have had a very difficult time. The fact that they were able to express themselves that way was the reason Jordan survived this period without violence."
So the King chose domestic tranquillity over international standing and financial solvency. As one diplomat put it, "He will be the popular King of a broken country."
In the meantime, democracy could be running away from him. His country may be teetering on the edge of political and economic collapse. But the King remains steadfast, monarchic.
"Under the circumstances," he says, eyes unblinking as he sits bolt upright in his chair, "looking back at whatever happened, the way we acted, or reacted, we couldn't have done it any other way."

The Name Is Forgotten, But the Legacy Is Enduring

BYLINE: By Hans Fantel

 BODY:
More perhaps than anyone else, Edwin Howard Armstrong made electronics the meeting place of art and science. His inventions are the main vehicle for music and the dramatic arts in our age; and the methods of wireless communication he devised now span the earth and reach into the depths of space.
Armstrong has been called America's foremost inventor, and historians of science point out that in imaginative scope and technical finesse he far exceeds Edison. Yet while Edison's name is an emblem, Armstrong's is nearly forgotten -- the more reason for marking his 100th birthday Tuesday. 
 There are other contrasts between Armstrong and Edison. Edison's method might be described as inspired tinkering, relying on trial and error to yield successful results -- a traditionally American style of invention throughout the 19th century. Armstrong, by contrast, was one of the first to let theoretical speculation based on mathematical analysis precede the actual construction of his devices. In this, he anticipated modern methods of research.
In other respects, however, Armstrong was old-fashioned for his era -- a strong-willed lone wolf who could not fit himself into the new pattern of corporate team research. It was this trait that led to his downfall and his death in 1954. Yet for most of his career, Armstrong was so securely armored by success as to seem impervious to tragedy.
Fame came to him early. In 1912, barely beyond his teens, he made the first of his seminal inventions -- the feedback circuit. This device raised the sensitivity of radio receivers hundreds of times over what it had been before and opened the way to reliable long-distance reception. Shortly afterward, his continuous-wave oscillator made it practical to transmit sound as well as Morse code via radio. Later, as television developed, Armstrong's circuits also facilitated the transmission of images, and today's satellite communications rest on his inventions. By implementing the instant transmission of information in all its forms, he created the nerve fibers of modern life.
As a student at Columbia University, Armstrong was already more famous than his professors, and his patents made him rich before he was 25. The superheterodyne circuit he devised in 1917 remains the basis of all radio communications to this day and gave the Allied armies in World War I a distinct edge in field communications. At the war's end, both the French and American Governments showered Armstrong with honors.
During the infancy of modern electronics, when many scientists still struggled to comprehend the fundamentals, Armstrong possessed an intuitive grasp of the flow of currents in complex circuits. To him, the happenings in those tubes, coils and condensers were an unfolding drama that he could plot and shape, much as an author fashions a play. It was this rare sense of circuitry as a kind of theater -- electronics as a stage for spectacular events, with electrons as the actors -- that gave Armstrong a creative vividness far beyond the domain of ordinary engineering.
By the late 1920's, radio had become a major factor in the dissemination of music. But Armstrong -- a passionate music lover -- was dissatisfied with the sound. From that time on, the musical fidelity of radio became his enduring concern.
He realized that AM radio, then the only kind, was mainly useful for covering long distances but limited in its sonic capabilities. By 1933 he had devised a new method of transmission that could accommodate the full spectrum of musical sound and eliminated the static that plagued conventional broadcasts. To achieve this, the audio signal representing the music was used to modulate the frequency of the transmitter, and this frequency modulation eventually became known by its initials as FM.
To demonstrate his new broadcasting method, Armstrong rigged a transmitter atop the newly completed Empire State Building and, in 1934, conclusively proved the merits of FM. At the same time, he also introduced another of his inventions -- multiplex transmission, the technical basis of stereo broadcasting. But not until a generation later was the public to benefit from these advances. By the very success of his experiment, Armstrong had set himself a trap.
The newly formed national radio networks immediately realized that FM, with its suitability for independent local broadcasting, posed a threat to their manner of operation. The networks mobilized both their economic and political influence to hinder the development of the new medium.
Lacking the support of the radio industry, Armstrong spent much of his fortune to build his own station, whose tower still stands above the Palisades of the Hudson River at Alpine, N.J. But before these efforts could create much public interest in the new broadcasting method, World War II diverted Armstrong's talents again to military matters.
After the war, the radio industry, like other American enterprises, reshaped itself into new structures that left little room for an individualist like Armstrong. His flair and his flamboyant personal style seemed discordant in the gray-flannel world of the postwar era. Besides, Armstrong's persistent efforts to set up FM under independent auspices riled the networks.
Eventually they found a way to divert Armstrong's energies. RCA, the parent company of NBC, involved Armstrong in a ruinous lawsuit over his most crucial patents. The man who virtually created broadcasting was now hounded by former friends who had gained financial control of his creation.
RCA kept Armstrong in court for nearly a year, confronted day after day by fresh brigades of corporate lawyers until his strength and fortune were spent. Armstrong fought the case all the way to the Supreme Court. Some of the legal examiners were simply not competent to follow the technical arguments on which he based his case, and the Court ultimately decided against him.
Soon after, the Institute of Radio Engineers, the foremost professional group in electronics, officially protested the verdict and passed a formal resolution recognizing Armstrong's claims in direct contradiction of the Supreme Court.
But that no longer mattered to him. Feeling that his work had been stolen from him, his mood darkened. On a winter day in 1954, he dressed as if to go out: coat, hat, gloves and a scarf neatly tucked in. Everything had to be orderly. From his skycraper apartment his eyes swept once more over Manhattan in the dusk. He pulled up a chair. Then he stepped out the window.

HEADLINE: Urban Epidemic: Addicts and AIDS -- A special report.;
In Newark, A Spiral of Drugs and AIDS

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Joseph Michael Donlon had an air of ironic detachment as he toted up the damages so far in December: an eviction from his hotel, a gash on his head from a cocaine dealer swinging a cinder block, a badly infected foot, a prescription of AIDS medication that got lost somewhere along the way.
 "After a while you get hard and calloused," Mr. Donlon, an addict for almost half of his 48 years, said placidly the other afternoon in the windowless room of his latest motel. Five hours earlier he had drunk methadone at a clinic here, and now he held a syringe filled with cocaine. He studied his forearm. 
I don't know where my veins have gone," he muttered. "South with the birds, I guess. Dear God, let me have one good hit." He inserted the needle, and then, briefly, there was disgust in his voice. "What a thing to ask God for."
 There are always moments like this for Newark's addicts, moments when things seem horribly strange. But at other times life almost settles into a routine. By now they have had plenty of experience adapting to the malignancies known on the street here by two generic names: the product and the virus.
 The product is drugs, the virus is AIDS and nowhere is the combination felt more acutely than in Newark, which has more AIDS cases per capita than New York City. Forty-three percent of the clients tested at drug-treatment clinics in the Newark area carry the virus, the highest rate in the country. At Newark's largest clinic, the rate is above 60 percent.
 The epidemic in Newark has always been what New York's only recently became: a disease that strikes intravenous drug users more than any other group. Of the 10,000 AIDS cases reported in New Jersey so far, most of them in Newark and other North Jersey cities like Jersey City and Paterson, 53 percent have occurred among drug users; in Newark, the figure is 69 percent.
 
Supply and Demand
 A subculture with its own economy has evolved. Fear of AIDS has spurred a market in new syringes, often supplied by diabetics, that sell for $3 apiece, though many addicts still buy used ones for half price. A "take home" -- a bottle of methadone that clinics provide addicts for the weekend -- goes for $35, or two bags of heroin.
 A $5 vial of cocaine can be bought with a case of Sustacal, a nutrient drink prescribed to prevent weight loss. The 12-can case, which costs about $30 in pharmacies, used to fetch $15 on the street, but the price has dropped as more AIDS patients sell the cans they get free through Medicaid. Some local groceries buy cans from addicts and resell them for less than the manufacturer's wholesale price.
 The price of sex has also dropped because of increased supply. As more women have become addicted to crack, they have turned to prostitution, often with infected drug users as clients, and the number of women with AIDS has risen
 rapidly.
 "A few years ago a woman would charge you at least $40, but you can find one for $5," said Linzy Richardson, 33, one of the many welfare recipients living at the Lincoln Motel in downtown Newark. "You see a woman with 20 men a day, and you know she got to get the virus. But people around here, they'll sell their mama to get the product. Especially cocaine -- they got to be smoking it or poking it."
 
'I Couldn't Wait'
 Mr. Richardson was speaking from experience as a user of both intravenous cocaine and a kind of heroin of unusually high purity called P-Funk or P-Dope. He told of sleeping on the floor of his last apartment for two months after selling off all his furniture and household possessions to buy drugs.
 "It was new stuff that cost $4,000, but I sold it to a guy for $500," he said. "I knew I could have gotten $1,000 just by taking it back to the store, but I couldn't wait until the next morning."
 This focus on the short term is one reason the epidemic keeps spreading. The prospect of AIDS and the need for a clean needle are often distant priorities compared to finding drugs, food and shelter.
 Another reason is the drug subculture itself: the people who know one another from welfare hotels, crack houses, methadone clinics, corner drug markets, prisons and hospital wards. Few other groups in the world -- gay men in some American cities, prostitutes at African truck stops -- include such a high concentration of infected people able to spread the disease.
 Why don't people escape the product and the virus? Scientists speculate about genetic predispositions to chemical dependency. Public-health officials blame a lack of money for drug-treatment programs and governments' refusal to let addicts obtain clean syringes legally.
 Social workers talk about the breakdown of families, governmental indifference to the poor and societal prejudice. Surveys across the country show that half of intravenous drug users are black and a quarter are Hispanic.
 Addicts on the street blame society and government for some of their problems, but tend to do more complaining about the other addicts around them. They also tend to blame themselves. Here are two of their stories: one about the product in its new smokable form, and one about the traditional variety.
 
A Prostitute's Story

 'The Devil's Always Knocking'
 It was a Sunday morning, and a 25-year-old woman known professionally as Kim Williams was in the lobby of the Carlton Hotel canceling an appointment for what is called a freak show. She had been hired to have sex with another woman while a group of men watched or joined in. They had promised her cash and crack, which would be smoked throughout the event.
 "I can't go with you," she said to one of the men who had come to pick her up. "I couldn't get a baby sitter."
 Later that day she found a baby sitter for her 5-year-old son, who lives with her in the hotel, and went out for a walk along East Park Street to explain how she had ended up in these circumstances, and why she was not afraid of getting AIDS.
 "First you use a drug, and then it uses you," she said. "I never used as a teen-ager. I used to be a snitch and tell my mother when I caught my sister.
 "But a few years ago my boyfriend got locked up, and I got so depressed because nobody was there for me. A friend offered me some coke, and I got hooked."
 
'I Must Be Crazy, Too'
 At one point, she said, she was shocked into quitting. "I was sleeping while some friends were getting high in the room, and when I woke up I saw them crawling on the floor, picking up little white specks, taking lint off a sweatshirt -- they were so desperate for coke. My sister was walking around looking like a zombie.
 "I started crying. I thought, 'I must be like this when I'm high. I must be crazy, too.' I got so scared I went into rehab and stayed off coke for eight months.
 "But around here the Devil's always knocking on the door. A friend sees you trying to do positive, so they be negative and offer you drugs. Misery loves company, you know."
 She had lost her last jobs, in a laundry and a bar, she said, and now was collecting a $322 welfare check and $192 in food stamps each month. She said it was barely enough to get by, even with the government paying for her room at the hotel, and the only way she could get money for drugs was through prostitution.
 It was an especially risky form of prostitution, both because of the drug-using clientele -- one of the men for the freak show that morning, for instance, was rumored to have AIDS -- and because of the crack use that accompanied it.
 
Lowered Inhibitions
 Cocaine often leaves men sexually aroused but unable to reach orgasm for a long time, which leads to prolonged sessions that increase the risk of genital abrasions through which the HIV virus can enter. Crack can also lower inhibitions, making women less likely to insist on condoms and more likely to have multiple partners to keep getting the drug. It helps make freak shows possible.
 For all these reasons, prostitution by crack addicts is believed to be an important factor in spreading AIDS. Of the women with AIDS in New Jersey, most are classified as intraveous drug users, but the sharpest recent increase has occurred among other women, who typically get the disease from a partner who is an addict. The number of new AIDS cases among those not using intravenous drugs last year was nearly three times higher than in 1986.
 "We've had reports of girls 11 or 12 years old actively soliciting to support their crack habits," said Barbara Ford, the AIDS coordinator for Newark. "When that's going on, it's not surprising that there's been such an influx of women being infected."
 So far a fifth of New Jersey's 10,000 cases have been women. For women, like men, the toll has been heaviest in the inner cities. More than half of the state's AIDS cases have been among blacks. At University Hospital in Newark, which serves a mainly black and Hispanic community, a survey two years ago found that one in 23 women giving birth carried the AIDS virus.
 Miss Williams, who had not been tested for AIDS, insisted that she was safe because she always used a condom and limited men on crack to three minutes. But she said other women did not take precautions.
 "A lot of the whores I see on the corner don't care," she said. "They're nasty and they'll do anything for crack. A lot of girls have disappeared, and you hear that they got AIDS. But I'm careful. I don't trust nobody."
 She said she was planning to go back to drug rehabilitation someday, and took pains to stress one point:
 "I may get high, but I never let my son see me smoke. I know what I'm doing is wrong, and it depresses me when I think of him doing it. You know the song, 'Losers are users, users are losers, so don't use drugs'? I sing it to him all the time. Slowly but surely he's learning about drugs."
 
A Dealer's Discovery

 'I Don't Feel Sorry for Myself'
 In 1986 Ceford M. used his full name when he appeared on a national television news program. He was introduced as a man who after seven years in prison for heroin dealing and murder had "found a better way." He had kicked his heroin habit, enrolled in a job-training program and won two promotions as a computer data processor.
 This year he insists on anonymity, in deference partly to his family and partly to the police. He lost his computer job in January as a result of a renewed drug habit, and has been supporting himself since by selling cocaine on the streets of Newark. He said he can make $1,500 in the first week of each month, when welfare checks come out.
 "It's really hard to come up with a reason I went back," said Ceford, 39, who had been introduced to heroin as a freshman in college. "I tried to stay off -- for five years I tried -- but something was always missing. I just loved the streets so much. For some reason I like the danger, the excitement."
 He does not necessarily like the people, though. Sitting in a coffee shop across Broad Street from the Lincoln Motel, neatly dressed in a corduroy sports jacket and a tweed cap, he waved disdainfully at the addicts in dirty sweatshirts milling in the motel parking lot. 'I Hate to Be Around Them'
 "Look at the way they're dressed," he said. "Just because you have a weakness, you can't let the rest of your life go. I know how to carry myself and speak correctly. I've got two years of college. I can be a stand-up John when I have to be, and I can be a street nigger. These people only know one way to act, and that's ignorant. I hate to be around them because they're always trying to get slick on you.",
 At this point, shortly before Thanksgiving, Ceford was still living with his wife and his 7-year-old daughter in the suburbs, but he was thinking of leaving. "I've been such a burden to her, I think maybe I should get out of her life," he said of his wife. "She's completely straight -- never touched drugs, very refined, college graduate, good job -- and it tears her apart to see what I'm doing."
 For some reason, he said, his wife had not seemed too concerned about whether he would acquire the AIDS virus. But he had recently gone in for a blood test and was waiting to hear the results.
 "You have to worry about the virus," he said. "A couple of friends of mine that I shared needles with a long time ago died of AIDS. But I'm still feeling good, so maybe I'll be all right." He had fresh track marks on his left hand from shooting cocaine -- the methadone he was getting at a clinic kept him off heroin -- but he said he had not shared a needle since finding out about the AIDS risk in 1983.
 This would put him in the minority of drug users, according to a study published this year by the National Institute on Drug Abuse of nearly 17,000 drug users surveyed in 45 cities, including Newark. Seventy-eight percent of the users reported sometimes sharing a needle. Of those, only 14 percent said they always cleaned the needle with bleach to kill the virus, as is recommended.
 
Finding New Approaches
 "It's disturbing that our public-health efforts haven't been more successful," said Stanley H. Weiss, director of the division of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark. Since 1984 Dr. Weiss has been tracking about 1,000 drug users in Newark and five other New Jersey cities, and finds that each year another 5 percent of them become infected with the AIDS virus.
 "The average drug user knows that AIDS can be spread by sharing needles," Dr. Weiss said. "Users are very smart -- they have to be street smart to survive. But AIDS is a relatively remote problem, especially when someone needs a fix at 2 in the morning. Its impact pales compared to the daily pressure to survive, and we have to find some new ways to reach them."
 One way, which was pioneered in New Jersey and is now part of a nationwide project conducted by the drug abuse institute, is to send former addicts into the streets. In Newark former addicts have recruited 1,800 addicts for counseling, an AIDS test and an interview by offering them $15 apiece and a voucher that would admit them to a drug-treatment program.
 "About half of the people end up using the vouchers for treatment,"said Bob Baxter, one of researchers directing the Newark portion of the project. "Obviously it would be preferable to get the rest in treatment, too, but at least we're reaching them with some information about safer sex and drug use."
 Only a quarter of the addicts who have taken the AIDS test have returned to get the results. One of those who did was Ceford, a week after the interview in the coffee shop, and the results sent him on a cocaine binge. On its fifth day he sat tensely in a friend's apartment. 'I Brought It On Myself'
 "They told me I got the virus," he said, "and I've been shooting ever since. There's nothing to live for. I'm going to shoot, shoot, shoot. Maybe I'll get lucky and get a heart attack. I watched my best friend die of AIDS, and it was awful -- he got so small at the end.
"I'm not going to let it come to that. I'll go out first."
 His wife cried at the news, he said, and accused him of getting the virus recently from women on the streets, because it had been so long since he shared a needle. But many people remain symptomless for a decade after being infected, so he could have gotten it from the needles he shared in the early 1980's.
 "I brought it on myself," he said. "You tell a baby a stove is hot, it still wants to touch it. I'd advise anyone thinking about drugs: Stay away from the product, because you're going to like it. Next to sex, ain't nothing like it.
 
'The Hurt in Her Eye'
 "I don't feel sorry for myself. A tear didn't cross my eye when they told me, and I think that's strange. But the only thing I felt was compassion for my wife. And then when I went to tell her, to see the hurt in her eye, that just devastated me."
 His wife now refuses to speak to him, he said, but he hopes she will tell him the result of her blood test when it came back. Either way, he said, he would not be moving back home.
 "I'll stay with friends or go in the city shelter until I get on welfare," he said. "I'm not going back to be a burden on my wife. But I would like to sit down and talk to her.
 "I would say I'm sorry, my life is numbered, but I don't want her to be sick. I want her to raise my daughter and do all the things she never got a chance to do. I'll tell you, I would give up my life this instant for her result to come back negative."

HEADLINE: Hard Times Strain the Spirit of Giving

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
TRADITIONALLY, the middle of December is the peak season of giving. But this year charitable organizations find themselves rich in volunteers but poor in dollars. And the need for funds has never been greater, say the directors of Westchester agencies, as they cite a rise in the number of people seeking help.
"On one Saturday in November, at the emergency food bank in Cortlandt, as many people came in for food parcels as were seen during the entire month last year," said Susan Winters, director of the Westchester Coalition of Food Pantries and Soup Kitchens in Hawthorne, headquarters for 84 emergency community food programs. 
 Ms. Winters said she expected a record turnout for Christmas dinners, judging from the attendance at Thanksgiving.
 
A Doubling of Diners
 "One New Rochelle church, which was pretty much representative of others, reported serving 170 dinners, almost double last year's number," she said. "Students at Hastings High School cooked and served 250 Thanksgiving dinners in the school cafeteria. It was a project they initiated. We arranged to pick up people in vans and deliver them home again. It was not only the homeless who attended. We noticed that more of the elderly came, and an increase in those who are out of work, like some people from the G.M. plant in Tarrytown."
There were also entire families, who brought their children. "Those are the children," she said, "who when asked on a kindergarten test to finish the sentence, 'When I'm hungry I . . .,' answer, 'I go to bed,' instead of the standard answer, 'I eat.' "
Despite the economic downturn, or maybe because of it, Ms. Winters said, individual donations to the coalition were running at about the same level as last year.
 
A Pressing Drive for Funds
 "I think it's because people identify with what we are doing," she said. "We have some loyal contributors who are committed to sending us small amounts of money every month, and that includes a man who has been out of work for a year, who still managed to send us $5 recently."
The drive for funds becomes even more pressing this year because the coalition was cut out of the budget proposed by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, she said, adding, "We received $50,000 from the county last year." The 1991 spending plan is now being reviewed and adjusted by the County Board of Legislators.
Another grass-roots organization, the Coalition for the Homeless of Westchester, based in Yonkers, has also lost financing.
"We lost our New York State legislative grant of $11,000," said Anthony Wynne, the group's executive director. "We're now in a crisis situation. We're halfway through our prime fund-raising months of November, December and January, and it appears we are certainly going to fall short."
He said his group was getting "fewer individual donations this year," and added: "People appear to be apprehensive, worried about the economy. They are more willing to give us time than money. We have more volunteers than ever this year, but fewer dollars."
Emphasizing that the Salvation Army has to raise more money because there are more needy people, Roger Rischway, director of volunteer services for the Salvation Army in Westchester and the Hudson Valley, said:
"We're hoping for a big last-minute surge in public generosity this year because contributions in the greater New York area are now 20 percent below last year's. Our kettle collections are down. In Westchester, our people are stationed in the main shopping areas and malls, so retail activity has a big impact on our collections. When retail activity is slow, it has a negative effect on donations."
 
More Volunteers Come In
 But the Salvation Army has also been able to increase its corps of volunteers this season.
"People from all walks of life are out of work," Mr. Rischway observed. "A lot of them prefer to work as volunteers rather than sit around doing nothing. We're grateful to have them because our caseload has increased with every layoff in the county. There are more people with more problems. There's a lot of misery around today, more than I've seen in a long time."
Barbara Rose, deputy general manager of the American Red Cross office in White Plains, said donations to the Red Cross had been running at last year's levels.
"But although contributions have remained generally the same, the demand for our services has become much greater this year," Ms. Rose said. "This year, we're supplying services to the military because of the situation in the Persian Gulf."
The Red Cross, she said, began supplying support groups for service families in September.
"Currently, we're counseling 52 families who have someone in the services, which has increased the caseload for our social workers," Ms. Rose said. "When people need more services, we feel we have to supply them. For example, when support checks don't come through to families, we bridge the gap by making them a loan."
Another Red Cross project, Images From Home, has been videotaping Christmas messages from families of service personnel at Red Cross offices in White Plains and Yonkers.
"Fuji Photo Film in Elmsford donated the equipment, and we'll keep taking and sending messages right through Christmas and afterward, as long as our troops are there," Ms. Rose said.
The Red Cross has also received more calls from people who want to volunteer their services this year, she said. "A lot of them are from families who have someone overseas."
 
Pen Pal Project Created
 The Red Cross is also sponsoring a "While You're Away" pen pal program at 250 Westchester schools. "Twelve thousand students have already sent letters to service people in the Gulf," Ms. Rose said.
The demand for services in Westchester also rises in the winter. "Winter means fire," Ms. Rose explained. "A few weeks ago, a terrible apartment fire in Mount Vernon made 23 families homeless. We were on the scene from 2:30 A.M. to 6:30 A.M., finding lodging for those families."
Ralph A. Gregory, president and chief professional officer of United Way of Westchester, said 30 percent of United Way's contributions came from corporations, 50 percent from employee payroll deduction plans and 20 percent from individuals. "Although ours is a year-round fund-raising effort," Mr. Gregory said, "there's always a strong year-end surge. This year, company downsizing and fewer employee groups have cut down the number of givers. In order to make up for the loss, we've made a two-pronged effort to increase the level of participation."
By broadening and deepening the base, which means trying to encourage more people to give and convincing those who give to give more, Mr. Gregory said, United Way has been able to raise more money from several companies that have fewer employees than they did last year.
"It's an important phenomenon," Mr. Gregory said. "It seems to me that what it signifies, is that people who have jobs are glad of their good luck and willing to dig a little deeper to help."
 
More Requests for Financing
 United Way finances 17 Westchester agencies, but the number of agencies asking the United Way for money this year has tripled, Mr. Gregory said. "It's a sign of the times. A couple of months ago, when the talk about state and county cutbacks first started, we started getting inquiries. Now, requests for financing are flooding in every day."
The requests come from agencies that are "a very important part of the health and human resource systems in the county," he said. "They all need money. Yet it's too early to tell how our campaign will go this year. Although we're encouraged by many of the results, overall fund-raising is not going as well as we would like it."
But a year's-end increase in contributions from individuals who want to take advantage of this year's tax structure is a possibility, Mr. Gregory said. "It's a minor thing, but it would be very nice to have that money up front."
Mr. Wynne said he was also hoping for a last-minute bonanza. The $19,000 his Coalition for the Homeless had in financing last year was used for its eviction-protection program, and saved 30 families from eviction. "If the county had to house those 30 families, it would cost them $1.4 million to do it," he said. "It makes no sense."
The future of the Coalition of Food Pantries and Soup Kitchens is also in jeopardy, Ms. Winters said, adding: "I spend a lot of time these days writing applications for grants. If we can't raise money somehow to keep going, we'll sink."

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN CATTLE COUNTRY

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Royte; Elizabeth Royte has written on the outdoors for the Atlantic and Smart.

 BODY:
AS IT REACHES downtown Sheridan, Mont., Highway 287 broadens out, a reminder of the days when the stagecoach, a four-horse affair, made wide turns in this mining and ranching town. Although the mines still pay off, intermittently, it's cattle ranching that sustains the economy today. Where two-story buildings stop, vast pastures and hayfields begin. Along Main Street, pickup trucks dominate the curbsides, and two times a year, manure splatters the highway as 3,000 cattle make their way to or from summer range in the Beaverhead National Forest.
Linda Robertson, owner of the Moriah Motel, doesn't mind the noise or the smell of cattle in the streets. The hollering cowboys and their blue heelers -- wily-looking dogs that respond to a broad vocabulary of commands -- fill her with pride, remind her of who exactly settled the West, made it the kind of place where hunters and other recreationists have need of roadside motels. But Robertson worries. Lately, the ranchers have been spending a lot of time at meetings, driving long distances and hiring expensive consultants to fight a noisy few who, it seems, are of a mind to put them all out of business. 
 Ten ranchers in and around Sheridan, population 700, hold Federal permits to graze their cattle on public land, in this case, the Upper Ruby Allotment of the Beaverhead National Forest, an enormous swath of high-mountain grassland and timber southwest of Butte. This public-private arrangement is universal in the West. It has been ever since the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 put an end to unregulated grazing. Today, 23,000 ranchers in the 11 Western states run cattle on about 270 million public acres -- an area the size of the Eastern Seaboard, from Maine to Florida.
In most cases, livestock operators graze on public land because they must. The parcels of land allotted under the homestead acts were too small to run a ranch. In the arid West, where the growing season lasts about 90 days, one cow can't make a living on less than 100 acres (a cow in Georgia needs only one acre). So in 1897, to encourage a growing industry, Congress ruled that ranchers would be allowed to lease public range lands.
Today, the condition of these public lands, and the cost of administering the grazing program, has united an unlikely coalition of environmentalists and sportsmen who are calling for revision, or even abolition, of the public-grazing system. Like the late conservationist Edward Abbey, many of them regard cattlemen as "welfare parasites" who transform the soil and grass of public lands into dust and weeds at taxpayer expense. Western ranchers contribute only 2 percent to the nation's total red-meat production, yet last year the Forest Service spent $34.5 million on its range management program and took in only $10.9 million in grazing fees. Critics charge that cattle lower the water table by widening stream beds, often causing streams to disappear. Cattle also represent the West's largest source of "nonpoint" water pollution -- that is, not emanating from a stationary source, like a factory.
The reactions to these depredations can be severe. A group in New Mexico advocates "No Moo in '92" -- total eradication of the grazing program. The Earth First Journal recently published an article urging citizens to pick up a rifle and shoot cattle on public lands.
But if it were only "fringe elements" screaming for change, ranchers would have little to fear. After all, history, a livestock-based economy and the clout of some powerful Western lawmakers have been on their side through decades of sporadic attack. But now the equation seems to be changing. A 1988 Government survey of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management labeled 68 percent in unsatisfactory condition. The bad news has spurred both the Natural Resources Defense Council and the National Wildlife Federation to file an administrative appeal against the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service for not conforming to their own standards, using questionable techniques when measuring grass consumption, and having few, if any, plans to address shortcomings. (In one national forest, the service doesn't expect to address acknowledged management problems until the year 2030.)
Under pressure, the Forest Service -- former paternalistic ally of the ranchers and lenient arbiter of minor trespasses -- has changed its colors. It has begun putting teeth into its mandate to safeguard the public lands and insure that recreation and industry get equal consideration. And in a policy shift that freezes the hearts of tradition-bound ranchers, public-lands grazing is slowly losing its priority status.

IN A SMALL, MODERN BUILDING ON Sheridan's main drag, Ron Stellingwerf, the local ranger, has for six years run his office in an atmosphere of unrelenting social opprobrium. Ranchers repeatedly try to have him transferred; a few recently hatched a tar-and-feathering scheme. Some ranchers call his range technician, Stephanie Wood, the Witch of the Ruby, and worse, and Stellingwerf's deputy, George Weldon, reports that some people pass him on the road and make an obscene gesture. "They probably think I'm Ron," he says. In a county fair parade in nearby Twin Bridges, a rider dragged a red wagon filled with cow manure topped off by signs that read "National Wildlife Federation" and "Forest Service."
The level of antagonism on both sides may seem slightly incongruous to outsiders. After all, news of an invader species pushing out native bunch grasses, or of a stream bed widened through cattle trampling, is puny stuff compared to the bold stroke of an oil spill or a toxic-waste dump. Some focus their ire on the low grazing fee -- $1.81 per cow and calf per month (known as an AUM, for "animal-unit month"), compared to private land, now going for $8 to $12 an AUM -- but the total loss to Montana each year is peanuts: just over $10 million. So it came as a surprise to many last summer when Don Oman, an Idaho ranger worried about overgrazing, counted the cattle using the forest -- and the livestock owner responded by threatening to cut Oman's throat with a knife.
The event galvanized the grazing community and polarized a situation already fraught with animosity. That the ranger felt he had to deputize Forest Service employees and pass out guns for his cattle count at dawn, and that the rancher felt antagonized enough to threaten a man's life, merely underscores the gravity of the central issue, which is neither the size of the grazing fee nor what percentage of forage a cow may take. What's at stake in Montana is a way of life: Will these ranchers, who've passed their property from generation to generation, be allowed to continue in the manner to which they're accustomed?
On a brilliantly clear October day, intermittently sunny and snowy, Fred Conley, a rancher, sits under a wagon-wheel chandelier in his large living room and limns the subtler considerations of the debate -- book-learned range scientists pitted against ranchers with degrees in "cowology," as a 72-year-old local puts it; citified sportsmen looking for a "wilderness experience" up against the economic reality of national forests as a resource for commodities; meddling government agencies taking on communities steeped in the tradition of vigilante justice.
"The people from New York or California trying to tell us how to run the economy haven't done a very good job with their own states," Conley says from his deeply cushioned Colonial chair. "We've lived here and cared for the land for a hundred years. The real people in this country know that with logging or mining or grazing livestock, anything where you use a natural resource, you're going to have some things that don't look exactly the way you want them. It doesn't mean the land is destroyed; it's the way things have to be."
Fred and Sue Conley's ranch, the Winkonley, lies 30 lonely miles from Sheridan in the Upper Ruby Valley. Inside the timbered house, dozens of rodeo trophies fill a glass-fronted cupboard. Outside, Chianina cattle and miscellaneous farm machinery dot 16,000 deeded acres of rolling wheat-brown grass. Conley leans forward intently. "The whole thing has been blown out of proportion by people who don't know what they're talking about," he says. "Before this issue is finished, there's going to be one whale of a battle when it comes to whether environmentalists can tell us how to run the land, the state, and the economy in the West. There will be a time when people in the West stand up to fight, but I hate for it to come to this."

GRIPING ABOUT RANGE conditions is nothing new. But population pressures, heightened environmental awareness and growing interest in the outdoors have recently inspired newspaper headlines predicting "range wars" over the issue. "Increased recreational use is the reason for the heat," says Rose Strickland, chairwoman of the Sierra Club's grazing subcommittee. "People go out hiking and they can't find a place to put their tent. There are cow pies everywhere." Johanna Wald, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, attributes the reform movement to economics as well. "We're struggling to come to grips with the deficit," she says, "and more and more people find it difficult to justify below-cost grazing fees."
Though some of the critics, like the Sierra Club, are well-organized and well-financed national organizations, many represent small grass-roots groups -- local recreation and sport clubs. Their constant pressure, plus mounting public dissatisfaction with the Forest Service's current management practices -- most notably, logging in the ancient forests -- has spurred the agency to rethink its values. Instead of managing forests strictly as commodities, the Forest Service is now beginning to consider them from an ecological standpoint. Mirabile dictu, say longtime conservationists.
But like any large bureaucracy, the Forest Service changes gears very slowly. "The rangers working now were trained to produce cows, not healthy ecosystems," says Tom France, the director of the Northern Rockies National Wildlife Federation. "So it's hard for them to understand the shift in values. They're struggling for it all to make sense."
Social pressures in a small, tightly knit community compound the difficulties of those few rangers, like Stellingwerf, willing to rock the boat. "If you live in a place like Sheridan," says France, "you want the community to do well, you want the people to say hello to you in the cafe. And if you've just cut a guy's income by 10 percent -- which is what reducing the number of cattle involves -- he's not going to be happy."
Cutting cattle is exactly what the Forest Service, and several other outside organizations, notably hunting and conservation groups, have in mind. It's the only way, they figure, to stop the overgrazing and, in particular, to repair heavily damaged riparian areas: the narrow corridors of green vegetation along river and stream beds. Riparian areas represent only 1 percent of Western public lands, but 75 percent to 85 percent of wildlife depend on them for survival. They contain a greater quantity and diversity of plant species than adjoining land; they provide food, water, shade and cover for fish and wildlife. Healthy riparian areas also hold water in stream banks, which helps keep the water table high and stream flow stable.
Upper Ruby ranchers think their riparian zones look fine, but the General Accounting Office reports that "extensive field observations in the late 1980's suggest riparian areas throughout most of the West were in the worst condition in history." The Forest Service's "Change on the Range" initiative, now in its third year, was designed to improve the situation by educating the agency's employees about the importance of riparian areas.
Bill Doggett, however, remains unimpressed. Doggett, a rancher whose great-grandfather came to Madison County for gold in the 1800's, says riparian areas are simply this year's trend, which the agency has seized upon to advance its ultimate goal: an end to all public grazing. A trim-looking 60-year-old, Doggett speaks plainly and firmly, sipping black coffee in the remodeled kitchen of his 90-year-old brick house. Behind him, beyond a redwood deck and his wife's flock of sheep, a panorama of waving hay fields rolls out for miles to the Ruby Range. For ranchers who until recently didn't have the term in their vocabulary, riparian areas symbolize an evil force out to get them. "We're being threatened by an environmental movement which is in some ways out of hand," says Doggett. "We're being depicted as rapers of the land. The Forest Service is being dictated to by outside groups. It's a political situation."
Bob Birrer, cow foreman of the giant Snowcrest Ranch, feels both powerless and blameless as Ron Stellingwerf's team sets about writing a new Allotment Management Plan for the Upper Ruby: "The old ranger on the district said the management plan from 1970 was fine. Now the new ranger says no, it isn't, and we have to pay for their mistakes."
Doggett, like Birrer and many others, says he believes the Forest Service is unfairly singling out the allotment "to see how much they can get away with." In a way, he's right. Says one Forest Service employee familiar with the situation: "The Upper Ruby is being made an example of. In other allotments we have the same problems, but people either feel change is futile or they go along to get along."

STEPHANIE WOOD RIDES the Upper Ruby Allotment on horseback five days a week, talking with ranchers, evaluating range conditions. A smallish woman with long brown hair and high cheekbones, she's a formidable opponent, nearly obsessive in her passion for the land and its potential. "We can't reduce vast areas of range to monocultures and have it continue to function," she says. "You keep pulling out plugs and eventually you pull up the link that holds the whole system together." Removing plants in the Upper Ruby, or eliminating species of fish, birds or soil microorganisms, she says, will ultimately lead to its collapse -- "like the Amazon rain forest."
The problem with communicating this doomsday scenario lies in Montana's relentless natural beauty. Cradled between the Gravelly and Snowcrest Ranges, the Upper Ruby Allotment is a cinematographer's dream. The Upper Ruby River, headwaters of some of the finest trout fishing in the country, meanders through rolling hills dotted with sagebrush, stands of yellow aspen and, at higher elevations, lodgepole pine.
Dust from the gravel road seeps into the Forest Service jeep as Stellingwerf and Wood wind their way through the nine-pasture allotment. Numerous creeks run to the Ruby, under barbed wire fences and down steep-sided hills that change from wheat brown to gold and sienna as the cloud shadows move overland. Silvery-green sagebrush perfumes the air and large game animals, mule deer, antelope and moose graze on the western slopes.
The rangers stop to look at a creek, pronounced "crick" hereabouts. The water looks clear, the channel narrow but for one spot where trampling has created a minor mudhole. Sharply defined stream banks are crucial, for when cattle widen the beds, the temperature of the now shallow water rises to levels potentially lethal to fish. Here, small yellow willow shoots line the creek, but they don't satisfy Wood. "There should be cottonwood and aspen in most of the drainages," she says. "We should have osprey and bald eagle, but there's no nesting habitat for them. There should be overhanging vegetation here."
Wood kneels on the stream bank and gestures with a gloved hand. "The willows should be tall and thick" -- so thick a cow can't get through them, she says. Are cattle and healthy riparians incompatible, then? No, says Stellingwerf, at certain levels they are. Once the riparians recover their health, a reduced number of cattle grazing at 50 percent utilization (eating half, leaving half) shouldn't be able to harm them.
Wood and Stellingwerf drive on, observing the effects of rest-rotation schemes, where a pasture is used for one summer then rested the next. There's no denying the land's aridity, but in rested pastures, the bare dirt and stones of recently grazed plots seem to disappear, covered by knee-high grasses. Stellingwerf and Wood try to point out the damage, the compacted soil, the encroaching non-native grasses, the lack of cottonwoods and paucity of smaller animal species, but their vision of a naturally functioning range system is lost on outsiders, on ranchers, on anyone who has never seen a healthy, ungrazed range land -- which means everyone alive today in this country.
"We don't know what the country looked like before barbed wire," says Tom France of the National Wildlife Federation. "There isn't a large area in the American West where livestock grazing doesn't occur." Before the Taylor Grazing Act, settlers ran cattle to ruin on the open range. Before that, the Spanish did, and buffalo roamed -- often overgrazing, but never staying in one place for long.
With range management admittedly more of an art than a science, the Forest Service struggles mightily to persuade ranchers they have a problem. "We've improved the land 300 percent in my lifetime, since the Taylor Grazing Act," says Bill Garrison, a rancher in the Deerlodge National Forest near Butte. "People in the agencies come and go, but we've been running cattle all along. We got these permits and we built our ranches around them. Now outsiders say we're ruining that range. It kinda sits hard in your craw." But the range can't help looking better today, since the number of cattle has decreased dramatically from the record herds of 50 years ago.
"How could we abuse the land so much and still make a living?" the ranchers ask incessantly. The changes in the landscape are so gradual, goes the answer, that ranchers are unlikely to notice anything amiss. "I can't tell at which point my hair turned gray," says George Wuerthner, a former botanist for the Bureau of Land Management and an outspoken antigrazing activist. "It's the same with soil erosion." Wuerthner, whose hair is blond, adds that even if human beings don't notice changes, displaced species do: "Grayling used to run in the Ruby and the Gibbon Rivers, but now they're only in the Gibbon, in Yellowstone, where there isn't any livestock grazing. In the Ruby, grayling have paid the price -- extinction."
Wuerthner, on his way to Yellowstone, stops his truck in the shadow of the Madison Range to point out a trampled stream running through a cow pasture. "I consider this vandalism," he says. "If I took a bulldozer and widened a stream channel and dumped raw sewage in the water, I'd be thrown in jail."
The Upper Ruby permit holders say they're willing to work with the Forest Service, but there's only so far they can go. Everything the agency suggests will cost them money: fencing off riparian areas, reducing the number of cattle, installing water tanks on ridges (to lure cattle out of creek beds), hiring riders to push cattle out of riparian areas, taking cattle off the public range earlier in the season (on private range they must eat private grass, which is limited, or hay, which is expensive).
"The Forest Service made us come off the range three weeks early this year," says Bob Birrer. "We lost thousands of dollars on that. And from constantly pushing the cows around from pasture to pasture, our calves were 20 pounds lighter. Another fellow's were 40 pounds lighter. That's a lot of money." Moving cattle also takes a lot of time: for many, the allotment is 30 or more miles from home, and, once they get there, it's a three-day horseback ride from end to end. The upshot of these hardships, ranchers protest, is their own extinction.
"If they implement a riparian standard that's so stringent you can't run cattle there, the permits will disappear and ranches like this, the backbone of the valley, will also go," says Bill Doggett. One report found local ranchers contributed more than $8 million to the six Montana counties it studied. "Without ranches in this area, there would be no Sheridan, no Twin Bridges," says Doggett's wife, Marilyn. "There would be no services, no firemen, no ambulance, no hospitals."
In another scenario, ranches could end up in the hands of corporations, says Bud Eppers, president of the National Cattlemen's Association, "and they won't do as good a job of caring for the resource."
Some conservationists say that raising the grazing fee to market levels would force ranchers to run fewer cattle on public land, give them a greater incentive to care for that land, and provide the Forest Service with money to enforce the law. But repeated Congressional attempts to raise the fee have failed, struck down by Western lawmakers. Ranchers contend that they pay nearly as much to run cattle on public land as on private once they figure in the costs of trailing cattle to faraway allotments, repairing fences, installing water tanks and losing stock to poisonous plants or predators. They scoff at the picture of wealthy ranchers sitting happy in their Cadillacs. "If they wanted to count the number of years us ranchers made a profit, they wouldn't need too many fingers, I'll tell you that," Fred Conley says.
Wuerthner takes a dim view of all economic defenses. "There are only 23,000 permittees in the entire West." he says. If laws were tightened and enforced, "some would go out of business," he admits, "but others would buy up more private land to graze on. It would be like one auto plant going out of business, but spread over the whole West." Since the West provides such a small percentage of the nation's meat, prices would rise only slightly. "People will have to adapt," Wuerthner continues, searching, as ever, for a new, invidious analogy. "It's like slavery -- it got to the point where the public wouldn't tolerate it."
Is grazing, then, a moral issue? Yes, Wuerthner answers loudly, gesticulating. "It's a moral issue because everybody pays in the long run. We pay a false price for beef as it is. Every filet mignon is a spring dried up, every steak is another riparian zone degraded, every hamburger is another dead wolf." (The Government allows Federal hunters to kill predators that harass livestock.) Visions of the humble ranching family struggling to hang on in a hostile social and economic climate don't sway Wuerthner. "I'm for helping people adjust," he says, "but I won't help them destroy the ecological health of the land for private profit, particularly on my public land."

WHILE THE experts hired by both camps sling range-utilization data and ratings comparisons at each other, the ranchers cling quietly to their bedrock supposition -- that grazing on Federal land is closer to a right than a privilege. "The people who were here first went through tremendous hardship to settle these operations," says Fred Conley. "They rode to town in a buckboard twice a year to get groceries. Those people are entitled to something."
Even tougher for the environmentalists to wrestle with is the romance of the old West. Routinely, they pull out their legal testimony for battle only to find that their opponent is not an agriculture-school range scientist wearing a pocket-pen guard but a living, breathing Marlboro man. It's Bill Conley, Fred and Sue's son, wearing a dusty black hat and roping bulls from atop his roan horse. It's Bob Birrer, teeth brown from tobacco, the creases in his face caked with dirt from a day sorting cattle in the dust. Somehow, the sound of 12,000 hooves and the sight of a dozen cowboys backlit by a sun setting over snow-crested peaks tugs the emotions so strongly that it's difficult for facts to intervene.
"People come out to look at the situation and they fall in love with these cowboys," laments Tom France. "It's the myth of the American West. The cowboys come off as the paragon of great American values. Now we're saying they're destroying public lands."
The conservationist Edward Abbey, of course, never fell for the image. He looked at the rancher and saw "a man who strings barbed wire all over the range; drills wells and bulldozes stockponds; drives off elk and antelope and bighorn sheep; poisons coyotes and prairie dogs; shoots eagles, bear, and cougars on sight; supplants the native grasses with tumbleweed, snakeweed, povertyweed, anthills, mud, dust and flies. And then leans back and grins at the TV cameras and talks about how much he loves the American West."
Such anti-industry polemics as Abbey's naturally anger ranchers, but so far the attacks have had little actual effect. The livestock industry's finesse at maintaining the status quo is legendary, and all out of proportion to its size. Where a critical mass of recreationists and conservationists have only recently become aware of range conditions, permit holders have exercised power through their stockman's associations and in local, state and national politics for more than a century. Today, their lobbies in Congress effectively quash increases in grazing fees, keep wolf reintroduction programs stalled and generally handcuff the Forest Service when it tries to implement reforms.
Why are so few so powerful? "All politics is local," says France. "The Congressman from New York doesn't care about grazing, and Westerners don't care about food-stamp programs in Brooklyn. Grazing is as close to a pork-barrel issue as the West gets." When district rangers want to cut stocking rates, ranchers routinely get on the horn to Washington and request a transfer for the person who's making their life difficult. And there are subtler tactics -- petitions, harassment of a ranger's family, bomb threats, the cold shoulder in the cafe. "Threats are not unusual at all," says Don Oman, the Idaho ranger. "In four years, I've been threatened nine times."
The myth of the cowboy works overtime for Sheridan, but despite a lot of tough talk, no one expects the range-war metaphor to take the shape of an old-fashioned shootout in a corral. Prosaically, what the permit holders fear most is that if the Forest Service doesn't put them out of business with tough regulations, the cost of defending themselves in court will. And it promises to be a very long haul: few believe that the Forest Service's new Allotment Management Plan, due in the spring, will mark the end of their troubles.

BY MID-OCTOBER, THE last of the cattle are coming off the Upper Ruby Allotment. Lowing and mooing, they trail down the valley, driven by weary men with hats pulled low against the sun. A few independent-minded calves, unfamiliar with the routine, stray away from their mothers and into adjacent pastures. Almost telepathically, the dogs bolt to round up these stragglers, nipping at their heels, exuberant and vigilant.
About halfway down, the Conleys sort their Chianina from Bob Birrer's Angus in a holding pen at the Snowcrest Ranch. On foot, and carrying a long whip, Birrer pushes the cattle toward two gates, eight feet wide, that form a large V. "Two coming, Snowcrest," he shouts, checking the brand, and Bill Conley, banditlike behind a black bandana, opens the gate on the left. A long brown squirt of tobacco hits the ground. "Three coming, Winkonley," Birrer cries next, and the cattle hustle through the opened gate on the right and into another corral. Meanwhile, another rancher steers his own herd down the long dirt road, past the Upper Ruby Reservoir, through the little town of Alder and up Highway 287 into Sheridan. Any car that wants to pass will just have to wait.
For several days afterward, Sheridan's Main Street bears witness to the cattle drive, but the mess is more a powerful symbol than a temporary nuisance. "I sure would hate to see all this change," says a patron of the town's only cafe, turning to look out into the street, turning to look out into the sunset.

HEADLINE: Southold Approves McDonald's

BYLINE: By ELLEN MITCHELL

 BODY:
JUST saying "McNo" is apparently not going to to stop McDonald's from opening in Mattituck.
The chain's proposal to become the first fast-food restaurant in the Town of Southold galvanized opposition in the form of petitions, rallies and a call for a moratorium on commercial development along part of Route 25. 
 "We don't like what McDonald's represents," the executive director of the North Fork Environmental Council, Warren Goldstein, said. "We're not just going after McDonald's. That would be unconstitutional. But we are opposing a fast-food alley. McDonald's would be a harbinger of things to come."
The council and the Concerned Citizens of Southold Town have marched outside Town Hall two times with signs saying, "Just Say McNo to McTraffic and McGarbage."
A regional vice president of McDonald's, Paul Facella, said the only thing golden that the company planned to do away with was its free-standing golden arches.
"Whenever we can work with a town, we try to make modifications," Mr. Facella said. "We have many more variations to our designs than we did years ago. You've got to keep up with the times. It sells more hamburgers."
 
'Cape Cod Brick'
 The plan, he said, is to use "a Cape Cod brick facade in neutral brown tones, reminiscent of fishermen's homes built in the 1800's."
The company has recognized pressure on the Island in the past. In New Hyde Park, the chain is renovating the Denton House, a 90-year-old building. Although rich in history and heavy with sagging gingerbread woodwork, it had become a dilapidated eyesore on a commercial strip.
Billed as McDonald's 12,000th restaurant, the $2.5 million Denton House project is being designed under the supervision of the North Hempstead Town Historic Landmarks Preservation Commission.
When completed, the site will be the one of the few places on Long Island to offer a fillet of fish and a visit to a museum at the same time.
Although McDonald's changes may be relatively new on Long Island, the company has been changing its facades in many other regions for some time, especially in New York City.
Art Deco neon lights are featured on 57th Street in Manhattan, and a Broadway restaurant has an Orchid Room with fresh flowers.
 
What the Groups Fear
 The opponents said they feared that the New England character of the Town of Southold would be jeopardized by an influx of fast-food restaurants. They contend that the arrival of McDonald's would "open the floodgates to all the others."
"People do not drive all the way out here to see McDonald's," Mr. Goldstein said. "Southold's economic face is in two areas, agriculture and tourism. If Route 25 turns into the kind of strip you see in western Suffolk and in Nassau County, people will stop coming here. The goose that lays the golden egg could be killed."
 
'Insist Upon Infiltrating'
 Debbie Sidlauskas, who moved to Mattituck eight years ago, said of the absence of a commercial moratorium, "I'm sick, really disheartened."
"What I really have against McDonald's is they insist upon infiltrating areas where it's not necessary," Mrs. Sidlauskas said. "I can't say it's the McDonald's Corporation that I hate, although the food is bad and the garbage is bad. It's just that I don't know of any area they've gone into where they don't end up with the kind of fast-food strips you see further west."
She said she was planning to boycott McDonald's, adding, "I'd rather spend a couple of dollars more and go buy a decent meal."
 
Concern Remains 'Bullish' <>
 Mr. Facella said that McDonald's had done its homework and was "bullish" about opening in Mattituck. The nearest McDonald's is seven miles away, in a fast-food strip in Riverhead.
The town may review drive-through restaurants first. Town Supervisor Scott Harris learned that fast-food emporiums relied on their drive-through lanes for up to 46 percent of their business. McDonald's said the lanes were especially popular with "tourists and kids in diapers."
Mr. Harris said he had initially opposed the McDonald's because he feared that it would "open the floodgates to a run of fast-food chains." He said he changed his mind after the Town Attorney had said Southold was likely to be sued if it amended its zoning code selectively, to block the McDonald's application.
"We're very proud of our rural heritage and atmosphere out here, but the environment is not the top priority any more," Mr. Harris said. "They're worrying more how to keep people here. It will be a delicate balance to keep both."
Joel Kroin wrote a letter to the editor of a local newspaper that he had traveled extensively and was disputing people who said McDonald's would cause a litter problem. He said that he had seen many McDonald's stores and that all were impeccabe.
"We looked at McDonald's track record and felt it would be a positive addition," the president of the Mattituck Chamber of Commerce, Robert Koch, said. "What's more, it would be pointless to try to stop a business from coming into town if zoning already permitted it.
"I think Southold will be kept with plenty of open space. I don't see a major change for a long, long time. Of course, we have to expect some change. You can't be stagnant."
William G. Albertson, who lives several miles from Mattituck, in the hamlet of Southold, has a 7-Eleven in his neighborhood that he fought.
"I'd prefer McDonald's to a 7-Eleven any day of the week," Mr. Albertson said. "In the spring, the fishermen meet at the 7-Eleven and they yell, 'Where are you fishing?' Wake up the whole neighborhood."

HEADLINE: Charities Are Facing Lean Time

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
EARLIER this month, Brian C. Williams, interim director of the Hunger Resources Program in Fairfield, got a call from a soup kitchen requesting 80 turkeys. But when he got to the freezer, only 10 turkeys were left, he said, and the group had no prospects of having any more donated.
"I'm scouting around for turkeys right now for Christmas dinners," Mr. Williams said. "Last year at this time, we had quite a few still in the freezer." 
 Charities and social-service organizations throughout the state say that while their clients' needs are growing rapidly, donations are flat or, in some cases, falling off.
Most of the organizations are in the middle of annual appeals, and many are reluctant to give any specifics while the campaigns are proceeding.
 
'It's Been Pretty Tough'
 "I don't think we want to get distracted by doom-and-gloom forecasts and create a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Pamela G. Hyman, executive director of Operation Hope of Fairfield County, which operates a variety of human-service programs. "We all try to maintain a positive outlook."
But there are some cracks in the facade.
"It's been pretty tough," said Ernest L. Parker, executive director of the Bridgeport Community Youth at Risk, a delinquency-prevention program that began a $300,000 appeal two months ago. "Some individuals who we could count on in the past have not come through. As for businesses, it's too early to say. We have our requests out, but we haven't gotten any responses."
Carol MacElwee, executive director of the United Way of Connecticut, said most of its local affiliates have set fund-raising goals this year that are up only 2 or 3 percent from 1989.
"In some cases, they've made those goals," Ms. MacElwee said, but "these have been very, very tough campaigns."
Even where the fund drives met their goals, she said, the local United Way groups are worried about "shrinkage," the difference between pledges and money received. "Where there are major layoffs, you have to worry about shrinkage increasing," Ms. MacElwee said.
For the first time in its 25-year history, Connecticut Public Television hired a professional fund-raiser this year to help solicit people who were members but have let their contributions lapse. These former members represent a loss of about $300,000 to the organization.
 
Problems Seen Ahead
 But Michael G. Watt, vice president of Connecticut Public Broadcasting, said its radio division just completed its most successful appeal ever, raising $208,000, up from $196,000 a year ago.
"I don't feel like the funds are drying up," Mr. Watt said. "Although you certainly have to tailor your message a little better in this kind of environment."
Bernard M. Fox, chairman of the fund-raising drive for the Open Hearth, a men's shelter in Hartford that recently completed a four-year, $5.1 million capital campaign, said he is glad he is not starting the same drive today. "Towards the end, we saw definite signs that it was getting harder and harder to raise funds," he said.
Mr. Fox, who is also board chairman for the Institute of Living, a mental hospital in Hartford, said, "I can see fund-raising problems starting there already."
Compounding the difficulty is the dwindling number of corporate executives who are available to help charities, Mr. Fox said. Corporate mergers have reduced the number of upper managers, he said, and those who are left must devote more of their time to the company in difficult economic times.
"For a country like ours, that has developed a system that depends on volunteers," this trend "has some serious implications," Mr. Fox said.
Even where fund raising has not declined, the officers of charitable agencies are worried. Patricia Brown, president of the Darien Book Aid Club, which collects new and used books to distribute to children in other countries, said her organization is keeping a worried eye on its annual appeal, which began last September.
 
Generous Utility Customers
 "We're about even with last year, which was about the same as the year before," said Mrs. Brown. "But, of course, that means we haven't kept up with inflation."
Mrs. Brown also said the 1989 appeal was buoyed by several large gifts late in the campaign; no one knows whether that will be repeated this year.
Not all charitable efforts are suffering. Emmanuel S. Forde, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, the state's largest electric company, said Operation Fuel, which allows people to add $1 to their monthly bills to help pay heating costs for low-income families, has done better than in 1989.
"We estimate that by the end of the year, our customers will have donated close to $270,000," Mr. Forde said. "That's up significantly from last year, when it was only $220,000." The company, which matches the customers' donations, will distribute $405,000 to fuel banks this year, he said.
"It's a lot easier to ask" customers "to add $1 to their check than it is to go out and look for $100 or $200," Mr. Forde said. "Maybe something like this is on a small enough scale that people can deal with it."
Ms. Hyman, of Operation Hope of Fairfield County, said the group set a $60,000 goal for its end-of-the-year appeal, up from $40,000 last year, because it is opening a new five-bed women's shelter. So far, she said, fund raising is running even with last year, but the group is hopeful it will meet the goal, because the 1990 campaign began a little later than in 1989. The extra money will be badly needed for the shelters, food bank, soup kitchen and drop-in center that Operation Hope operates, she said.
 
Broadening Appeals
 "We're seeing increased demand for all the services but particularly the food services, where demand is up at least 15 percent," Ms. Hyman said. "In the food bank, we're seeing people who are recently unemployed and seeking help for the first time."
Next year, she said, Operation Hope will rely more on events, like a concert and a road race, to raise money. "I think you reach different groups of people with each different event that you do," Ms. Hyman said. "And these days, you have to reach as many different groups as possible."
United Way offices across the state also stressed broader appeals this year, with some success. Ms. MacElwee said that despite the bad economy, Connecticut residents managed to bring many of the local United Way campaigns up to their goals. The Hartford-area drive, for instance, met its goal of $26 million, up from $25.03 million last year. And in the Bristol area, the group met its goal of $1 million, up from $928,000 a year ago.
But in Stamford, where United Way set a goal of $5.58 million after raising $5.42 million last year, it raised only $5.45 million. And some local efforts lost ground: in the Naugatuck area, only $375,000 was raised, $25,000 less than the goal and $16,000 less than 1989; and in the Winsted area, fund raising dropped from $400,000 to $365,000.
But in economically depressed northeastern Connecticut, the Willimantic United Way raised $403,000, $3,000 more than the goal and $18,000 more than a year ago, Ms. MacElwee said.
"Considering the state of the economy, we felt pretty good about the results this year," she said. "But there are none of the double-digit increases we've seen in other years."
Mr. Williams, whose organization distributes food to 73 social-service agencies in southwestern Connecticut, said he is worried about what will happen after the holidays, when people are less inclined to remember their favorite charities. He ended 18 months of unemployment two weeks ago when he got his interim director's job, Mr. Williams said, so he knows first hand the problems people on the street face.
"In January and February, that's when more people will come out of the cold and seek help at various shelters at food banks," he said. "And if we don't have the contributions we need to do our job, those organizations can't do theirs."

HEADLINE: It's Time for Hanukkah, and for Kwanzaa

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
"SHALOM, KOHAIN HALEVI," the children called out in greeting as the headmaster stopped by the classroom at the Bereshith Cultural Institute here to visit the younger students and to admire their Hanukkah decorations.
In the pre-kindergarten class taught by Zipporah Yant, the 4-year-olds had made cardboard menorahs, replicas of candleholders used during the eight-day Jewish Festival of Lights, which began at sundown Tuesday. They had also prepared a play about the holiday season and were learning the customs and history of Hanukkah. 
 Upstairs at the Bereshith Cultural Institute, the students in Renee Buggee's sixth-grade language arts class presented holiday poems, written in calligraphy on special paper, to the religious leader Kohain Nathanyah Halevi, as he is formally called. "Kohain" means priest, a title recognized by the African Hebrew diaspora.
 
Combining Two Observances
 The theme of the poetry writing in Ms. Buggee's classes was not limited to the Jewish Festival of Lights. In addition to observing Hanukkah, the children were also learning about the nonreligiousAfrican holiday of Kwanzaa, which takes place at this time of year and embodies the themes of giving and sharing.
"We made up a word to describe the theme of our poetry," Ms. Buggee said. "We call it Chanu-Kwanzaa. We are combining two holidays with a lot in common."
Like Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, which begins Dec. 26 and runs through Jan. 1, is a time for gift-giving, candle lighting and parties.
In joining two cultures -- a black African heritage and Hebrew customs and religious practices -- Bereshith Cultural Institute hopes to give its 135 mostly black students in kindergarten through sixth grade "a sense of identity that makes them feel good about themselves," Ms. Yant explained.
 
'A Sense of Pride'
 "Sometimes all you hear about people of color are the negatives, the difficulties," Ms. Yant said. "Here the children are taught many different cultures, and they learn that their roots go way back. It gives them a sense of pride."
Bereshith, which in Hebrew means "In the beginning," is not only a school open to anyone but also a place of worship and a meeting site for the community, said Kohain Halevi, who runs the school with his wife, Serather Halevi, director of the preschool.
There are about 50 African-American Hebrew families living in Mount Vernon and, including Bereshith, there are three black Hebraic congregations, Kohain Halevi said.
"We are blacks coming from an African-centric perspective," he explained. "We are descended from the ancient Israelites of Egypt, consider Israel our national homeland and we teach the principles of the Torah."
The African-American Hebraic movement began in Harlem during the 1920's under the direction of its founder, Rabbi Wentworth Matthew, an immigrant from West Africa. The establishment of the first African-American Hebrew congregation in Mount Vernon dates to the 1970's.
Kohain Halevi said that although black Hebrews observe many Jewish laws and customs, such as reading the Torah, observing the Sabbath and celebrating the holidays, there are differences that set them apart from mainstream white European Judaism. For one, the religious leader of Bereshith is not addressed as "rabbi" but as "kohain." Also, while the Old Testament is the primary Bible studied by the African-American Hebrews, the New Testament is used also.
The African heritage dates to the original biblical Hebrew tribes in Egypt before the birth of Moses and the exodus and dispersion of Hebrews. Later, slave traders further displaced the black Israelites, and many blacks today are reclaiming that heritage, Kohain Halevi explained. As exemplified by the dual celebration of Kwanzaa and Hanukkah, Bereshith's students and its congregation bring diverse elements to their religion and everyday cultural life.
"Take Hanukkah, for example," Kohain Halevi said. "It is about those who were willing to fight to maintain their traditions rather than be overwhelmed by a dominant culture. That is a very strong theme for us."
Likewise, the principles of Kwansaa provide inspiration, he said. Kwansaa celebrates seven principles: Unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith.
 
School and Community Events
 The Bereshith Cultural Institute, which was founded in 1977, in the basement of a private home, moved to its present quarters in 1982 when the institute purchased the 50-year-old building, once a health-care center, on Fifth Avenue here.
The building is used seven days a week -- on weekdays for the school and on evenings and weekends for community events, forums and meetings. It is used Saturday mornings for Sabbath services.
Each school day begins at 7:30 A.M. when the day-care program offered by the Bereshith Cultural Institute opens. Classes officially start at 9 A.M., five mornings a week, with an invocation -- a combination of a traditional Hebrew prayer and an African morning prayer -- and the singing of the black national anthem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing."
"We do not salute the flag," Kohain Halevi said. "We respect it, but our allegiance is to God. The focus is that this is not the land of our nativity."
With a paid staff of 34, the school is dedicated to "getting a jump on 'cultural inclusion,' " the headmaster said. "It's a phenomenon that's going on in education today. Our goal is to teach the students about their heritage and, in so doing, to boost their self-esteem, their self-image. We work on discipline and character development."
While attending school, the children wear uniforms made of blue cotton imported from Gambia, trimmed in a cloth Kente print, a traditional African pattern. The Star of David is embroidered on one sleeve.
The classroom teaching interweaves state-required curriculum with lessons in the students' Hebrew heritage and the black cultural experience. There are classes in Hebrew.
"I've seen an influx of older students lately," Ms. Buggee said. "Many are from single-parent homes and need an atmosphere where self-worth is stressed. So in the classroom, we look at heros such as Jesse Jackson and Harriet Tubman, the former slave. The students identify with them."
Hot breakfast and lunches, with many African specialties on the menu, are cooked on the premises. With the holiday festivities in full swing, some favorite dishes include roast lamb and couscous and potato pancakes. A dinner program for students in the day-care program is being considered.
 
Student Aid Available>
 In addition to income from tuition payments -- $325 a month for the preschool program and $225 for students just attending classes and luncheon -- the institute operates with some subsidies from the State Department of Social Services for the 120 students in its day-care program. Scholarship assistance for students is available through fund-raising events at the institute.
"Finances are always a concern," Kohain Halevi said. "In private education you can't raise taxes when you need more money."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Free Trade Imperils a Free-Trade Zone in Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAUS, Brazil, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Here in the heart of the Amazon, palm trees and tropical decay give way to a unexpected sight: row upon row of shoebox-style factories that churn out millions of radios, television sets, tape recorders, watches and pocket calculators each year.
Brazil's largest manufacturing center after Sao Paulo, Manaus is the boom town that protectionism built. Since a free-trade zone enveloped the city in 1967, Manaus has attracted 600 factories and has quadrupled in population, to 1.3 million people, about two-thirds of the population of Amazonas State. 
 Last year, virtually all the state's tax revenue came from the industrial park, which employed 137,000 people and produced $7 billion of products, including brands by makers like Ericsson, Gillette, Honda, Kodak, Olivetti, Philco/Ford, Philips, Sanyo, Seiko, Sharp, Siemens, Sony, Telefunken, Thomson, 3M, Toshiba, Yamaha, Xerox and Wilkinson.
 
An Unexpected Challenge
 But five months ago, Manaus woke up to an unexpected challenge: What happens to the free-trade zone when the entire country becomes a free-trade zone?
In July, Fernando Collor de Mello, Brazil's President, dropped import bans on more than 1,000 products. He also vowed to reduce import tariffs from an average of 80 percent today to 20 percent in 1994.
"The manufacturers are all frightened; they are used to protection," said Ronaldo Bomfim, a planner in the Manaus Free-Trade Superintendency, a Government agency.
The move toward free trade is a shock for manufacturers in a country where the word "contraband" is still used to describe imported facsimile machines and videocassette recorders. Already, American diapers, American tires, American candies and American toys are reaching Brazilian store shelves in time for Christmas.
 
Products to Be Imported
 In what may be the beginning of a shakeout of assembly lines here, Sharp S.A. Equipamentos Electronicos, the zone's largest employer, announced in October that it would shut two lines here that make pocket calculators, clock radios and tape recorder-radios. Sharp will now import these products from Japan.
"The idea is to deactivate the product lines that are not internationally price competitive," Eduardo Magalhaes, executive vice president of Sharp, said in Sao Paulo.
Workers in the 5,500-employee factory will be transferred to lines that produce color television sets and videocassette recorders.
Although BASF, Philips, Sharp and Toshiba have talked of shutting assembly lines here, most manufacturers appear to be waiting to see if Mr. Collor will be able to fulfill his goals.
"He's opening to imports, but after a while he will realize that the country does not have the dollars," said Otto Fleck, executive director of the Amazon State Industrial Center, a business group. "No one is closing their factory. No one is moving their factory to Sao Paulo."
Indeed, Brazil's trade surplus in October was $223 million, the lowest monthly level since January 1987. Pushing down the surplus were high prices for imported oil and an overvalued cruzeiro, the national currency.
But business and Government leaders agree that companies here face for the first time the challenge of competing with more efficient producers in Southeast Asia, Europe and the United States. "Industries are going to have to adapt, to modernize, to automate," Mr. Fleck said. "Obviously, there are some businesses that will not be able to compete."
Manufacturers in Manaus say they have traditionally struggled with two major handicaps: a Government requirement to use an average of 78 percent of Brazilian-made components, and the isolated location of this city, the largest in the Amazon.
A survey in November by Veja, a Brazilian weekly news publication, found a wide price gap between consumer goods sold in Brazil and goods sold in the United States. Color television sets, videocassette recorders, microwave ovens, vacuum cleaners and washing machines were 50 percent to 275 percent more expensive in Brazil than in the United States.
On Nov. 19, the Government appeared to meet one of the complaints by abolishing the domestic component requirement. In its place, it required that assembly operations in the zone add 30 percent to the value of imported components.
 
1,700 Miles From Cities
 In the 1960's, political considerations dictated placing Brazil's free-trade zone here, about 1,700 miles by air from Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's largest cities.
But because of Brazil's inefficient ports and its shipping cartels, it is cheaper to ship a ton of cargo from South Korea to Sao Paulo's port of Santos than to ship the same ton of cargo from here to Rio de Janeiro.
Indeed, Manaus is closer by air, 675 miles, to Georgetown, Guyana, than to Belem, which is at the mouth of the Amazon, and closer by road to Caracas, Venezuela, than to the nearest major Brazilian city, Brasilia.
But the two-lane road from here to the Venezuelan border is not paved and it is impassable during half of the year because of heavy rains.
 
Paved Road Called Essential
 The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have largely stopped lending money for road-paving projects in the Amazon because of damage to the rain forest that comes with settlers. "To reach the Caribbean market, it is essential to pave the road," said Mr. Bomfim, the Government agency planner.
Starting 15 years ago, when there were only 47 factories here, merchants tried to bring consumers here.
Although only 5 percent of local production is sold duty-free to tourists here, the trade has given this city the air of an electronic bazaar, with blaring loudspeakers and flashing television sets competing from adjoining stores. In a ranking of Brazilian cities, Manaus scores 12th in population, but 8th in sales taxes.
But domestic tourism slumped after Mr. Collor announced that he would open the country to imports. Many Sao Paulo shoppers calculated the cost of hotels and of the airfare for the four-hour flight and decided to pay the 80 percent tariff on imported goods sold at home.
Seeking to revive the trade, the Government in July raised the duty-free exemption for shoppers leaving here to $1,200, from $800.

Jitters in a 'Recession-Proof' Trade

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Since the Depression, the notion has prevailed that publishing is largely a recession-proof industry. Publishers have argued that because books are inexpensive, provide lasting pleasure and are sought by a relatively affluent clientele, their appeal persists even in hard times.
But now there is widespread concern that publishing's resilience may have been exaggerated and may today be no more than a myth. 
 In part, this concern reflects the striking changes in publishing over the last decade. With the spread of chains like B. Dalton and Waldenbooks, many more bookstores are now in shopping malls, where they are acutely vulnerable to the general shrinking of retail business. And the casual mall shopper is widely perceived as far less committed to book buying than is the industry's traditional public of bibliophiles.
 
Shrinking Income
 Publishers and booksellers also note that the recession comes at a time when the discretionary income of much of the middle class has shrunk. With hardcover book prices rising quickly toward the $25 mark, an alternative gift like a necktie or a bottle of liquor may look relatively cheap.
In addition, with the popularity of videos, Nintendo and other forms of entertainment, competition for people's leisure time has never been as tough.
"I always thought the industry was recession proof -- until this year," said Harry Hoffman, the president of Waldenbooks. "To some extent, the industry is being hurt. Traffic is down at least 4 percent in the malls in recent months."
Leonard Riggio, the president of Barnes & Noble, which also operates the B. Dalton stores, observed: "Over all, there is no question that we can feel the fact that the economy has slowed. In the past three or four months, there has been a noticeable slowdown in traffic in the malls."
The two leading chains account for about 35 percent of all bookstore sales.
 
A Victim of Its Own Success
 Thus, in a sense, the publishing industry has become become a victim of its own success. "We've been successful in broadening our readership in recent years, but these more ephemeral book buyers are those cutting back in a recession," said Edward Morrow, the co-owner of the Northshire bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt. He added that his own store, hit by the acute recession in the Northeast, was showing "a clear tapering off" in sales in recent months.
Still, general-interest, or trade, books account for less than half the overall $14.9 billion publishing business, and other sectors like college and professional publishing have been holding up reasonably well. Bill Lofquist, a publishing analyst at the Commerce Department, said he expected industry sales to rise to $15.9 billion this year. "It's not a super year," he said, "but it's not bad."
Moreover, independent stores in some parts of the country appear to be doing well. "We are having a very good season," said Joseph E. Gable, the president of the Borders bookstore in Ann Arbor, Mich. "People around here still view books as inexpensive and rewarding presents."
Over all, the Association of American Publishers expects sales of trade books to rise this year, but only marginally when adjusted for inflation.
Nonetheless, although books have fared better than many other retail sectors, there is great anxiety. Much of the fall in shopping mall sales has taken place in just the last few months. Moreover, the downturn comes in the midst of the Christmas season, which usually accounts for 20 to 30 percent of the annual sales of any bookstore.
Mr. Riggio of Barnes & Noble predicted that if a typical recession lasts 11 months and involves a 2 percent fall in gross national product, "this one will be longer and somewhat deeper."
As a result of the large advances now paid to many authors and the growth of publishing houses into conglomerates with high fixed costs, publishers are much more vulnerable than before to a sudden downturn. "Companies used to be lean and advances modest, but now we're bloated and expensive to run," said Jason Epstein, the editorial director of Random House.
Roger Straus, the president of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, said, "I've been told we're recession proof all my life, but the fact is that business is poor right now."
An example of the industry's difficulties can be found at Kroch's & Brentano, which operates 20 stores in the Chicago area. Half the stores are in malls. "Our mall sales have fallen off considerably in recent months -- between 5 and 10 percent," said Bill Rickman, the company's president. "The marketplace has changed and the new mall stores are more tenuous." By contrast, sales at the company's other stores have held up well.
The apparent vulnerability of publishing to a recession has led some publishers and booksellers to question the notion that publishing ever was recession proof. In an unscientific business riddled with anomalies, such ideas take hold without ever being subjected to rigorous examination.
"I've always heard that we're recession proof but never seen an economic study that proves it," said Mr. Morrow of the Northshire bookstore.
Several publishers said the proof of the industry's former ability to resist recession lay in the fact that several of today's big companies were started in the 1920's and grew through the Depression. These include Random House, founded in 1927; Simon & Schuster, founded in 1924, and Viking, founded in 1925.
But Mr. Lofquist of the Commerce Department said the Depression was, in fact, a bloodbath for many publishers. "In 1929, there were 721 publishers with sales of $182 million," he said. "But four years later, there were just 410 publishers and sales had plunged to $82 million."
And although there is a widespread belief that publishing weathered the 1981-82 recession well, figures from the Association of American Publishers show virtually no growth for trade book sales in that year, compared with an average of 13.3 percent in the years since 1982.
So perhaps, the purported resilience was always largely mythical and the current downturn may be no different from that of past recessions -- except for the fact that book sales are more thinly spread and publishing companies more leveraged, so it just might be worse.

All-News Radio Grows Rapidly in France

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Forget about the images of Frenchmen browsing through Le Figaro as they dawdle over cafe au lait before setting off to work. The French are now ingesting the news as rapidly as it takes them to gulp down an espresso.
France Info is France's only 24-hour news radio station. In just three years, it has attracted more than two million listeners, according to Mediametrie, a French audience ratings company. Modeled after the all-news radio stations in the United States, France Info broadcasts news reports on the half-hour and news updates every 15 minutes. 
 Broadcast in 97 cities, France Info now has France's fifth-largest radio audience and, since June 1987, has been winning listeners faster than any other station.

 "Three-quarters of France Info's audience are under 35 years," said Pascal Delannoy, the director of France Info. "It's a young, very active and relatively affluent sector of the public who have less and less time and need to know more." That audience contrasts with American listeners of all-news radio, who tend to be older than 35.
The success of France Info is no mean achievement. The weekly magazine L'Express and the daily newspaper Liberation began all-news radio stations in the 1980's, but both stations failed.
France Info faces tough competition. At 105.5 on the FM band, the station vies for listeners with nine large general-interest and musical stations, which together have 70 percent of the audience.
Distinguishing France Info from the other stations is the absence of advertising. France Info, a subsidiary of the state-owned radio giant Radio France, was started with an initial budget of $3.4 million. Today, two-thirds of the station's $9 million annual budget is subsidized by the state, with the rest financed by a system of sponsors, whose names are mentioned before each segment of the half-hour news program.
"It is public enterprise, not private industry, that created France Info and made it a success," Mr. Delannoy said. "France Info would not have been successful with the constraints of advertising. No one would have been willing to listen to our program if it was interrupted every five minutes by advertising."
But the success of France Info may also be a sign of the times. "When we tried to launch Radio Express in 1984, it just wasn't the right time," said Bernard Maziere, who ran the private all-news station. "There wasn't any demand for an all-news radio. People preferred to listen to music. They weren't interested in news.
"Because a unified Europe is becoming a reality," he said, "the French now feel a need to look beyond their borders, and one of the ways of doing so is to tune in to the news."
Even now, not everyone is happy with the way in which France Info handles the news. Some critics have even called it the McDonald's of information.
"The priority given to facts over analysis has made the news aseptic and transformed journalists into cold manipulators of raw facts," France's National Union of Journalists recently complained.
 
Dry, Repetitive Format
 Yet it is precisely France Info's rather dry, repetitive format, devoid of analysis, that is appealing to a new audience.
"There is a proven need for repetition," Mr. Delannoy said. "The public has complained that the other stations go too quickly. That explains why we have people tuning in for an average of 70 minutes, in spite of the fact that they are hearing basically the same news four times over."
France Info emphasizes national and world news and does not cover local events in the way that many American all-news stations do. It does, however, offer two-to-three-minute broadcasts on topics ranging from the stock market to traffic reports to gardening tips, as well as live sports coverage and the weather.
Radio France, which has 10 international offices and 47 radio stations in France, provides France Info with a network that more than compensates for its own small team of 50 journalists and 25 technicians. As a result, France Info can also offer extensive international coverage, most recently evident in live reports from Iraq, which often gives it an edge over other stations.
"We are the only radio that covers international events thoroughly and, as a result, our audience is becoming more and more international," Mr. Delannoy said. "Immigrants are listening to us because we are covering more than just France, we are covering the world."
While in the past, state-owned radio and television stations have sometimes sacrificed objectivity for political interests, executives of France Info believe the station retains its credibility with its listeners.
"Radio France has provided us with a lot of advantages and no real disadvantages," Mr. Delannoy said. "We run ourselves as an independent station and our objective is to report the news and nothing but the news."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Gay Press Looks to Madison Ave.

 BODY:
Like many other gay news publications, Outweek magazine wants to broaden its advertising base to include mainstream advertisers.
But the New York-based weekly has taken a gamble that even the largest gay magazine, The Advocate, has shied away from. It eliminated its most lucrative ad category -- phone sex ads, which accounted for 35 percent of its revenues -- earlier this fall to make its pages more attractive to skittish national advertisers. 
 "It's a risk," said Grant Luckenbill, vice president for sales and marketing at Outweek. "But we believe we will become the first to attract the Budweisers and the American Expresses."
 
Potential Market
 So far, Outweek has signed on only a handful of new advertisers. But the move illustrates the belief of many executives in the gay press that only by attracting mainstream advertising can they tap the tantalizing potential of their market.
Estimates of the size of the gay population vary widely. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, for example, says there are roughly 23 million gay Americans. Meanwhile, some marketing surveys have indicated that readers of gay publications are relatively affluent.
Serving this market are about three-dozen publications that write about issues in their local gay community and survive on advertising from local businesses. One of the most successful, The Bay Area Reporter in San Francisco, has a circulation of 35,000. But most print less than 20,000 copies, which are usually distributed free.
And only one magazine -- The Advocate -- can truly be called a national publication, although Outweek has national aspirations.
 
Advocate vs. Outweek
 The Advocate, which has been published for 24 years, has a paid circulation of about 65,000. The biweekly magazine emphasizes news about gay issues around the nation, including attacks on homosexuals, developments in the fight against AIDS and legal and political questions.
Outweek, by contrast, is a younger and more outspoken magazine. With a paid circulation of 28,000, primarily in the New York City area, the two-year-old magazine covers many of the same issues as The Advocate, but it has gained a reputation for radical articles like one with the headline "I Hate Straights" and others that claim to expose the gay life styles of the rich and famous.
As well known as the two magazines are in the gay community, their small circulations present a fundamental obstacle to attracting national advertisers. "Without the readers, it's difficult to get the advertisers," Mr. Luckenbill acknowledged.
Why doesn't the gay press attract more readers? A fundamental reason appears to be the hesitancy of many gay people to identify their sexuality publicly, gay publishing executives say. "Buying a gay magazine or looking at things from a gay perspective requires a commitment of consciousness or even a risk that many gay people are still not willing to make," said John Knoebel, the president of Liberation Publications Inc., which publishes The Advocate.
Gay press executives maintain that the rising number of gay-rights and AIDS-support groups will spur the growth of gay publications.
 
Few Well-Paying Advertisers
 "The movement's need for accurate and fair information that serves as a basis for action creates an opportunity for us," said Richard Rouilard, editor of The Advocate.
Ads from local businesses -- gay bars, restaurants, doctors and travel agents -- and phone sex ads account for 90 percent of the revenues in most gay publications, said Joseph Di Sabato, whose company, Rivendale Marketing, places ads in the gay press. He said gay publications were still attracting only a few well-paying national advertisers, like Absolut vodka and Remy Martin cognac.
While acknowledging that low circulation is a problem, Mr. Di Sabato argued that the gay press enables advertisers to reach an audience with considerable disposable income.
A 1988 survey of the nation's eight largest gay newspapers by the Simmons Marketing Survey found that the average reader was a 36-year-old man with an income of $36,800, substantially more than the national average. He had more credit cards than the average American, went to more restaurants and movies, and bought more books and records.
"Pretty clearly, there are more than economic factors going into the decisions of those companies who won't advertise with us," said Mr. Di Sabato, who said "homophobia" was the most serious problem.
 
'Stuffy, White-Bread Company'
 Indeed, as an advertising representative of a national corporation acknowledged: "We're just basically your stuffy, white-bread company. I can't really see us ever deciding to go into a gay magazine."
But William Tragos, the chairman of TBWA Advertising, the agency that places the Absolut ads in gay magazines, said most advertisers failed to see the market's potential.
"Most people only consider circulation figures when they want to place an ad," he said. "But we have found these among our best buys because the readers have shown a much greater than average loyalty to our product."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Baker Still Voicing Hope for Iraq Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, sounding a conciliatory note, said today that he still hoped that Washington and Baghdad would soon agree on dates for a diplomatic dialogue.
Mr. Baker declined even to hint that Washington was preparing to back down on its insistence that his meeting with President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad be held no later than Jan. 3, and not Jan. 12 as Iraq has demanded. But American officials appear poised to compromise if the Iraqis agree to choose a date such as Jan. 5 or 6. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Baker, speaking with reporters while flying to Brussels for the annual winter meeting of NATO foreign ministers, said that if no talks were held, owing to a failure to agree on dates, he did not believe that the American people would accuse the Bush Administration of not having made every effort to avert a war.
And for the first time, Mr. Baker spoke publicly about the difficulties that Administration faces in drawing a line between its understanding of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's need to maintain order at a time of increasing economic chaos and Washington's desire to insure that this understanding does not become a license for the Soviet President to snuff out every rudimentary effort to establish free markets outside the Soviet Government's control.
 
Contrast to Bush Comments
 On the Iraqi talks, Mr. Baker's words were in contrast with the stern, almost threatening tone of President Bush on Friday, when the President declared that the proposed Washington-Baghdad discussions were being put "on hold" because of Iraq's refusal to accept American dates.
Today, Mr. Baker's studied moderation seemed to signal that the Administration still wanted and expected a dialogue with Iraq. His remarks appeared to respond to the conciliatory statement Saturday by Iraqi Information Minister, Latif Nassif al-Jassem, who said his country still wanted a "deep dialogue" with Washington on the Persian Gulf crisis, despite the dispute over the dates of the talks.
"We hope something can be arranged," Mr. Baker said, speaking of when he might go to Baghdad to meet with Mr. Hussein. "I was a little surprised this morning to see a report from Baghdad to the effect that we had only offered four dates -- Dec. 20, 21, 22 and Jan. 3."
"Just so there is no misunderstanding," he added, "let me say right here that we are offering any one of the following dates for the meeting in Baghdad: Dec. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, Jan. 1, 2 or 3."
The Iraqis have countered by suggesting that Washington choose the date when Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz can come to the White House, while Baghdad be allowed to pick the date when Mr. Baker can meet Mr. Hussein.
 
Looking to Jan. 15
 The Americans want the meeting in Baghdad to be as soon as possible -- and no later than Jan. 3 -- so the Iraqis will not be able to say after the meeting that they have not had sufficient time to consider what the Americans have said, or to withdraw their troops from Kuwait by Jan. 15, after which the United Nations authorization to use force takes effect.
The Iraqis apparently want the Baker visit to be as late as possible to give time for anti-war sentiments to continue blossoming in the United States and in hopes of enticing some Arab neighbors into a negotiation before the United Nations authorization is effective.
Mr. Bush, in originally calling for the dialogue, offered the Iraqis any day between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15 that was mutually convenient, but since then he has narrowed his time frame.
Mr. Baker was asked whether if the talks were canceled altogether because of the dispute on dates, the Administration would still be able to persuade the American public it had gone the extra mile to avoid war.
He answered: "I think it will be, because we are being very forthcoming, having offered 15 separate dates, any one of which we would accept. It does seem to me that people will understand that, so far at least, it is an effort on the part of the Iraqi Government to manipulate the President's good-faith offer of discussions and to turn it into an exercise that would try and circumvent the United Nations deadline of Jan. 15."
On the flight here, the Secretary of State said that while he was not bringing any specific requests for more money or material assistance from NATO allies for the gulf confrontation, such formal requests will be put forward in early 1991.
 
Soviet Problem Addressed
 On the Soviet economic problem, Mr. Baker said, many farmers these days, instead of shipping their output to centrally controlled Government stores, were selling it themselves or bartering it for what they need. In other cases, food is being stolen and sold on the black market. Both phenomena have worsened the economic chaos.
Washington, Mr. Baker said, has made clear to the Soviets its view that "some of what is happening on the economic front represents the emergence of rudimentary markets and that it would be extremely unfortunate if those rudimentary markets were snuffed out."
At the same time, he added, some of the distribution problems that the Soviets have been encountering in recent months were clearly the "consequences of criminal actions, and it is not inappropriate for the central Government to be able to expect to enforce its reasonable laws respecting criminal activity. So there is a line there that has to be walked."

HEADLINE: In the Ravaged South Bronx, a Camelot Is Envisioned

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
Over a vast, half-desolate swath of the South Bronx, a place of lonely businesses, empty lots and storefront evangelists, planners are drawing the core of a new city.
Their proposal seeks to transform the appearance and economic potential of one of the country's most resilient symbols of urban blight by creating a synergy among a wide range of development projects, some already under construction, others merely proposed. 
 A new police academy, for instance, would provide security for an expanded civic center, while a new nursing school would join a hospital and a growing community college in an area high on unemployment and low on nurses.
Little more than a decade after some cityofficials and planners were declaring the South Bronx to be beyond renewal, the huge plan's ambition is itself a powerful sign of progress in the borough.
After years in which big, publicly financed development projects seemed to land in every borough except the Bronx, the plan's main parts also appeared until recently to have considerable support from Mayor David N. Dinkins.
 
Financial Hurdles Loom
 Yet as New York's financial outlook has darkened, the questions that the plan faces have sharpened and its support at City Hall has waned.
"From a planning point of view, I know we believe it is an appropriate and suitable plan," said Barbara Fife, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development. "It's a good,positive planning decision for the future of the Bronx. The questions are the trade-offs."
Called the Bronx Center Plan, it was outlined last month in the long-term Strategic Policy Statement required of each borough under the new City Charter. And while it builds on some ideas that planning officials set forth at least five years ago, it has been greeted with an enthusiasm that is significant precisely for its realism -- the recognition that fiscal constraints could delay the plan for years.
 
Preparing for Progress
 "When the economy slows down, we can do one of two things," said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the New York City Public Development Corporation, a nonprofit city agency that has monitored the Bronx plan's evolution. "We can wring our hands, or we can take advantage of this time to do thoughtful, longer-range planning so that we can have structures in place when the next wave comes. And that's what we're doing in the Bronx."
Yet if the Bronx plan has cornerstones, they are two projects that the city's Office of Management and Budget has fought to strike from the 10-year capital plan scheduled for release Friday.
One is a new Police Academy, which the Koch administration and then the Dinkins administration initially agreed to build on three square blocks east of the Grand Concourse and south of the courthouse on 161st Street.
Because the complex would draw hundreds of police officers each day, it has been viewed as a singular source of security for a burgeoning civic center that is still fringed by areas of high crime. But after being scaled back from a $200 million job to one that might cost $160 million, one senior city official estimated its chances for inclusion in the ever more austere 10-year plan at "50-50."
 
Housing Prospects Wane
 The other critical project is Melrose Commons, a development of about 4,000 moderate-income apartments that also won approval from the Koch administration and early favor from Mayor Dinkins. The city's Housing Commissioner, Felice Michetti, acknowledged that the development's prospects had waned with the city's fiscal health.
In lobbying for the plan, Bronx leaders have stressed their borough's habitual last place on the big-project lists of city agencies. But they also insist that its importance reaches beyond the Bronx.
"The issue is not building pretty buildings," said the Borough President, Fernando Ferrer. "This would create wealth for the borough and the city. It will create jobs. It would increase the tax base. The point is to create a new economic engine."
The key to that goal is the way in which the plan's different elements would complement one another: a parking lot that by day would serve a new housing court could at night be used for events at the expanded arts museum next door; in another area, housing and shopping areas would be expanded side by side.
Despite the "center" in its name, a new Bronx with the plan fully realized could well leave the area resembling the Oakland of Gertrude Stein -- there would not necessarily be a "there" there.
During the 1980's, city and borough officials concentrated efforts for the South Bronx along the Grand Concourse. From 161st Street, planners argued, they could push the recovery further south.
By contrast, the new plan envisions building four separate sub-centers or "nodes," in which different projects would be grouped to complement one another and from which stability could spread.
 
Civic Center Planned
 The most central would be a civic center surrounding the county building that houses Mr. Ferrer's offices and the State Supreme Court. Along with restoration of the building and three surrounding parks, the plan envisions a major expansion of the Bronx Museum of the Arts, a new Housing Court next door and at least two new courthouses and a 40,000-square-foot office building.
Across from the courthouse, private builders have almost finished the first phase of what was to be a $120 million shopping, entertainment and office complex, Concourse Plaza. But despite commitments for more than half the space, construction of the office building has been delayed by loan difficulties, borough officials said.
Further down the Grand Concourse, the plan would anchor a second, "institutional center" with the new Police Academy. Along with Lincoln Hospital, several public schools and a landmark post office, the cluster includes Hostos Community College, which is in the midst of a $200 million expansion.
East on 149th Street, the plan calls for a makeover of the Hub, the area around Third and Westchester Avenues that is the borough's second busiest commercial district after Fordham Road.
 
Cloud Over Housing Project
 While perhaps not the most costly, the part of Bronx Center that poses the greatest challenge is its fourth sub-center, Melrose Commons, a huge moderate-income housing development north of the Hub.
To build an entire neigborhood where there are now mostly vacant lots and abandoned buildings would cost more than $400 million over 12 years. City housing subsidies alone are estimated at $100 million, and some officials are skeptical about developers' chances of drawing better-off home buyers into an area ringed by housing projects.
The plan faces other questions as well, especially about the borough's poor public transportation links and the difficulty of drawing investment to an area that counts its high concentration of empty, city-owned land and the underemployment of its labor force as chief attractions.
Mr. Ferrer and his aides do not deny the drawbacks. Their plan, they argue, is merely the best option to integrate some of the city's youngest, poorest and least-employed residents into the economic mainstream, while wresting the South Bronx from the grip of poverty.
 
Preparing the Prelude
 Having gathered wide support for their ideas within the borough during a months-long consultation that produced a report -- "New Directions for the Bronx" -- last April, borough officials are pressing ahead.
They are beginning talks with the American Institute of Architects to set up a special workshop in which architects, urban planners and landscape designers would draft proposals for specific parts of the plan. A conference of investors would follow, planning officials said.
"It's a very good example of what comprehensive planning is all about," said Sylvia Deutsch, the City Planning Commission's former chairwoman. "It may take some time and an upturn in business and a freeing up of the capital budget to get done, but the necessary prelude is there."

HEADLINE: $5 BILLION '91 LOSS SEEN FOR U.S. FUND INSURING DEPOSITS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, L. William Seidman, said today that the Government's fund that protects bank deposits, already at its lowest level in history, would probably lose $5 billion next year, moving it perilously closer to insolvency.
That is the most dire portrait yet drawn by the Government of the fund's problems. The fund has incurred increasing losses, paying out more than it has received in premiums from banks, as the Government has had to compensate depositors at banks that have failed in recent years. 
 Such a loss next year, on top of expected losses this year of at least $4 billion, would leave the fund with about $4 billion. And much of that money might not be readily available in cash.
Mr. Seidman also predicted that 170 to 200 banks would fail next year, comparable to the number of failures expected this year.
 
'Inside Information'
 His remarks, made on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" and in an interview later, went considerably beyond recent glum forecasts about the fund by the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office. His projections, the first official estimates for 1991, are based on "inside information from our examiners in the field," he said.
"It's a fund that's so weak that it needs to be recapitalized," Mr. Seidman said in the interview. "Nineteen ninety-one is not going to be a good year."
Mr. Seidman and the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, who also appeared on "Meet the Press," said that the cost of shoring up the declining fund would be borne by banks and not by taxpayers. The Government is already deeply involved in a bailout of the savings and loan industry that the Administration currently estimates could cost taxpayers as much as $130 billion, excluding interest payments.
 
New Regulations Urged
 The banking industry is currently suffering a serious decline in earnings, and many economists suggest that the Government must change how it regulates banks. [Page D1.]
The Administration is preparing a package of proposals scheduled to be released next month for overhauling the banking system. Among them will be recommendations on fixing the insurance fund, largely by increasing the contributions from banks.
In June, the insurance fund had 60 cents for every $100 in deposits covered. Today's prediction means that the fund could be down to about 18 cents for every $100 in deposits by the end of next year. Experts have generally agreed that the minimum safe level for the fund is $1.25 for every $100 in deposits, based on actuarial calculations of the problems the fund could encounter.
Five days ago, Mr. Seidman had increased his estimates of losses for 1990 to at least $4 billion, from $3 billion. He said today that 80 percent of the losses reflected anticipated bank failures in the coming months.
On Monday, a House banking subcommittee will release a report that paints an even bleaker picture of the deposit insurance fund. That report is based on economic projections for the next three years. Mr. Seidman said his estimate is "not based on an economic model or anything like that."
If Mr. Seidman's forecast is correct, 1991 would be the fourth consecutive year of losses and the worst year in the history of the deposit insurance fund, even though premiums will be increased by 62.5 percent on Jan. 1. In September, regulators decided to increase bank premiums in January to 19.5 cents for each $100 in deposits, from 12 cents. The F.D.I.C. has said that it will consider raising the rates again early next year and that it is studying the impact a further increase would have on weaker institutions that could collapse if the rates were too steep.
Mr. Seidman said the aim of the proposals under consideration would be to achieve a payment from each bank equivalent to 1 percent of its deposits. That would add $20 billion to $25 billion to the fund.
 
Stock Plan Considered

The Bush Administration is also considering a number of proposals to reorganize the fund without causing still more institutions to fail. One idea under study would have all of the more than 12,000 banks with insured deposits buy stock in the fund. The stock could then be used to satisfy Government requirements that banks keep a certain amount of money aside as a cushion against losses.
Some regulators and bankers find this approach appealing because it would add to the fund without appearing to hurt banks' balance sheets. But the plan has been criticized by some accountants and by the nation's Comptroller General, Charles A. Bowsher, as an accounting gimmick.
"The insurance fund needs to be recapitalized, but not by creating fictitious investments on the books of banks that overstate their true capital position," Mr. Bowsher said in a recent letter to Mr. Brady.
Mr. Bowsher and other critics have said that it would be difficult to value such stock, particularly because there would be no market for it and the price would have to be adjusted downward for any future difficulties of the fund.
 
Extended Recapitalization
 Mr. Seidman said another idea that he believed bankers would favor would begin recapitalization of the fund this year and extend it through next year to reduce the immediate impact of a premium increase.
The Administration is also formulating a plan to charge higher premiums to weaker banks. The theory is that premiums based on the riskiness of investments made by the banks would more closely approximate private insurance and would discourage speculative investments.
But several leading banking experts have questioned such a dramatic shift in policy and have said that a reliable method of assessing the riskiness of investments would be difficult to develop.
To achieve accurate pricing, the Administration is exploring the idea of using insurance companies as co-insurers.
 
Forcing Insolvencies?
 Another concern of both regulators and outside experts is that a change in the system to a risk-based program would be counterproductive. Charging weaker banks more could force still more institutions into insolvency, they say.
It is too soon to determine how much of the bank insurance fund next year will be in readily available cash. Mr. Seidman has said that only $7 billion now in the fund is immediately available, with the rest consisting of assets from failed institutions that cannot be easily sold and money that the F.D.I.C. is required to hold in reserve.
As a result, Mr. Seidman said that next year the fund may be facing a "problem of liquidity" that would require it to begin using some of a $5 billion line of credit that the F.D.I.C. has with the Treasury Department in order to continue to close and sell troubled banks.

HEADLINE: 2 Convicted of Killing Amazon Environmentalist

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 16

 BODY:
A rancher and his son have been convicted in the murder of a celebrated Amazon environmental leader, breaking a long tradition of impunity for pro-development forces in Brazil.
The rancher, 54-year-old Darly Alves da Silva, was convicted of planning the Dec. 22, 1988, murder of the Francisco (Chico) Mendes, leader of a rubber-tappers' union who became internationally known as a defender of the rain forest. The rancher's son, 23-year-old Darci Alves Pereira, was convicted of firing the shotgun blast that killed Mr.Mendes. Both were found guilty and received 19-year sentences late Saturday. The prosecution had sought 30-year sentences. Brazil has no death penalty. 
 The ranchers had sought to expand their pastures by cutting down rainforest. In opposition, Mr. Mendes led the rubber tappers, men who gather latex from wild trees in the forest.
Human rights defenders hope that the explosion of cheers that greeted the verdicts in the small wooden courthouse in Xapuri, in Acre state, about 2,600 miles northwest of here, will now be heard across this huge land of 150 million people. The Pastoral Land Commission, a Roman Catholic group, estimates the more than 1,000 Brazilians have been killed since 1980 in land disputes, virtually all of the victims members of rural unions representing tenants, landless peasants, laborers. Of these murders, the Catholic group says, convictions were only achieved in two cases.
In a typical case, a lawyer for a sugar cane workers union was shot to death Thursday in the Atlantic coastal state of Pernamubuco.
The unionist, Jose Helio da Silva, had ignored several written death threats, including one that said: "Chico Mendes sleeps because he talked too much."
The murder of Mr. Mendes, a mild-mannered, mustachioed man who would have turned 46 last Saturday, became an international cause celebre as concern grew in Brazil, Europe and the United States over unchecked cutting and burning of the Amazon rainforest.
Partly as a result of this outcry, the Brazilian Government has abolished tax benefits that had made it profitable to cut the forest for pastureland. A public awareness campaign appears to be slowing the burning of the 2-million-square-mile Amazon, the world's largest tropical forest.
In one of many tributes to Mr. Mendes, the Government has established in Acre a 2.4 million acre Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, which is to allow 3,000 families to make a living gathering wild rubber and nuts without fear that ranchers will burn the forestdown.
In Brazil and overseas, Mr. Mendes has become an international symbol of the fight to preserve the Amazon. This year, three books have been published on Mr. Mendes's struggle.
Next year, David Puttnam, the British director, is to start filming a Hollywood movie of the Mendes story.
 
Viability of Rubber-Tapping
 But even as outsiders extol Mr. Mendes and the rubber tappers' environmentally safe way of life, debate has erupted over the long-term viability of the tappers' way of life.
Indeed, the tapping of wild Amazonian rubber only continues because of high tariffs on rubber imported from Malaysian plantations. In a move that may soon affect the Acre rubber tappers, growers recently planted 9 million rubber trees in Sao Paulo state.
While the economic threat may be impending, the physical threat often seems more immmediate to the rubber tappers.
Last week, taking advantage of the presence of a large number of Brazilian and foreign reporters at the Mendes trial, Osmarino Amancio Rodrigues, the slain unionist's political successor, announced that he recently received a series of death threats.
"For now, the general level of violence in Acre is down, no doubt due to the glare of international publicity surrounding the trial of Chico Mendes' murderers," read a report last week by Americas Watch, the New York-based human rights group. "The real test will be what happens in Acre when the spotlight of world attention is turned off."

HEADLINE: Brazil Reportedly Plans Debt Payments

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Brazil will announce on Monday the end of its undeclared moratorium on interest payments on its foreign debt to commercial banks, the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper reported today.
Brazil's Government has said previously, most recently earlier this month, that it would make some payment against its arrears, which totals more than $8.5 billion. 
 O Estado said Brazil foreign debt negotiators would tell the banks' advisory committee in New York on Monday that Brazil will resume paying interest on its bank debt in January.
Telephone calls to the Economy Ministry seeking comment were not returned on Sunday.
The third world's largest debtor nation began skipping most interest payments on its medium- and long-term bank debt of $60 billion in July 1989.
Brazil has come under increasing pressure from its creditor banks, which seem to have persuaded the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Nakasone Fund, a Japanese foreign aid program, to tie disbursement of $5 billion in loans to Brazil's progress in negotiations with the banks.
As a result of this pressure, Brazil agreed earlier this month to allow the payment of $940 million by the end of the year. With the banks asking for $2.5 billion, talks again bogged down.
Quoting an unnamed member of the Government's economic team, the newspaper said the announcement Monday is intended "to not leave any doubt about the good faith of the Government in its negotations."
The administration of former President Jose Sarney said it suspended the interest payments to leave adequate foreign exchange reserves to the new Government.
The administration of President Fernando Collor de Mello, which took office last March, has continued the suspension. The Government has maintained that it will not pay the arrears until an overall new debt agreement is reached.
Brazil has total debts of $119 billion, and its proposals in October for repaying the $60 billion of bank debt over a 45-year period were quickly rejected by the institutions as being unrealistic.

HEADLINE: Stability in Yields Is Seen for Now

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
For the time being, credit market analysts say, the breathtaking decline in bond yields is probably over. But the near-term stability may be just a pause in what remains a bull market.
Between now and the end of the year, the temptation will be strong to lock in profits that have been building since mid-October, when long-term interest rates began to slide. Moreover, concerns about the Middle East will probably mount as the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations for Iraq's withdrawl from Kuwait nears. 
 "I don't think we have seen the bottom in interest rates," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. "But we may have to wait a few weeks before the rally resumes."
While bond yields will probably not move much below their current levels of 8.18 percent for the time being, unremitting signs of economic weakness will prevent them from rising much, analysts said.
 
Selloffs Called Opportunities
 "I don't think there is a lot of downside to buying bonds between now and the end of the year, because the economy is weak," said Roger A. Craig, director of fixed-income management at the Banc One Asset Management Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. "You have to look to these selloffs as opportunities to add to your positions."
The magnitude of the downturn in the current quarter became clearer on Friday, when the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production fell by 1.7 percent in November, the steepest monthly decline since December 1982, when the nation was beginning to crawl out of a recession.
Given the sharp drop in November employment, analysts had expected that manufacturing output would show a big downturn. And even though the number was bigger than expected, some economists said that the report was good news.
 
Controlling of Inventories Seen
 "It is encouraging that industrial production is dropping so sharply because it suggests that people are controlling their inventories very tightly," said David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI McGraw Hill. "The way this is developing makes it look like we will have a mild recession."
While the fourth quarter may well prove to be the deepest point of the current downturn, economists at Salomon Brothers argued in a recent analysis that peace in the Middle East -- commonly viewed as a salutary development for oil prices and consumer confidence -- would not revive the economy.
"The recession now has a life of its own," Richard B. Berner, wrote in the firm's Comments on Credit weekly. "The economic harm done by proliferating job losses would overwhelm any positive fallout from any peace-related drop in oil prices. And plunging disposable income and mounting unemployment are more real threats to consumption and confidence than prospects of war in the Mideast."
 
Fed Panel Meeting Today
 Consideration of the economy's health will probably be the main topic of discussion at today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee.
Until late last week private economists were fairly uniform in their view that the Fed would use the occasion to endorse another easing in monetary policy and lower the overnight Federal funds rate by another 25 basis points, to 7 percent.
Inflation data released on Friday showing that producer prices rose by half a percentage point in November, a greater increase than had been expected, disrupted the consensus about when the Fed's next move will take place.
The November Producer Price Index report "may very well have impeded what would otherwise have been a further easing," Elliot Platt, chief economist at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, said in a weekly bond market commentary.
"The Fed will cut the funds rate to 7 percent," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "But they might not do it at this meeting."
At the very least, the Fed will probably delay any move to reduce the funds rate until after it sees November's consumer price data, which are expected to be released tomorrow.
Thanks to the first decline in retail energy prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait, most analysts are forecasting that the Consumer Price Index will show a November rise of three-tenths of a percentage point, half the increase recorded in October. Excluding the food and energy components, the analysts said, the index will probably register an increase of about four-tenths of a percentage point.
In addition to the fresh inflation report, some analysts said the Fed would be well advised to pay close attention to what almost certainly will be another negative report on the health of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to be released to Congress this week.
"The U.S. economy's balance sheet is rapidly deflating," said Robert T. McGee, a senior vice president and economist at the Tokai Bank. "Under these circumstances, the Fed's and the market's focus on G.N.P. and inflation numbers is analogous to a driver concentrating on the road ahead while forces underneath the road are building to earthquake proportions."

HEADLINE: Taco Bell Finds Price of Success (59)

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Twice a week, Kendall Williams, a 26-year-old department store clerk, drives to Taco Bell for lunch from his job at a mall here.
"They have fast service, and the price is good," said Mr. Williams, as he handed over $2.66 for a large burrito and a small Pepsi. "I like a change of pace from burgers, and this is a fast way to get Mexican food." 
 Taco Bell is winning the fast-food wars on the strength of such reports from the front. The chain, a subsidiary of Pepsico Inc., is making impressive gains in sales and profits after cutting menu prices. The intent has been to create the perception that Taco Bell is the chain with the best deals on meals.
Under the ebullient leadership of its president, John E. Martin, the Taco Bell Corporation, based in Irvine, Calif., has also spruced up its image in recent years and convinced Americans that tacos and burritos are as American as Big Macs, not to mention less expensive.
Last year, Taco Bell introduced a "value menu" of 59-cent tacos and other items and then expanded it in October. The pricing strategy has worked extremely well. Taco Bell is the best-performing large chain in the fast-food business, posting strong double-digit sales and earnings growth. Taco Bell's performance stands out all the more against the sluggish sales growth in the rest of the industry.
According to Restaurant Trends, a market research firm, Taco Bell is generating same-store sales growth of 10 to 15 percent annually, high above the industry average of about 2 to 4 percent. Same-store sales figures cover outlets open at least a year. Growth at many fast-food chains has suffered as competition has increased and consumers have become more wary about higher prices.
Taco Bell's systemwide sales should reach $2.5 billion this year, according to Pepsico, marking a second straight year of 25 percent increases.
But even Taco Bell, which has about 3,200 outlets, may find it hard to maintain its momentum, particularly if there is a strong recession. The company's pricing strategy is being matched by many competitors, ranging from Wendy's, which offers its own value menu, to Del Taco, a Southern California rival that heavily promotes a 49-cent taco.
Of course the fare at Taco Bell -- American versions of Mexican-style foods like burritos, tostados and tacos -- will never appeal to everyone. The chain and the entire Mexican food segment of the industry account for about 5 percent of the $75 billion spent on hamburgers, chicken and other fast food.
Still, Taco Bell, which says its ingredient costs are comparable to those of other fast-food chains, is making its presence felt. In recognizing that threat, McDonald's has moved aggressively to protect its turf. This summer in Denver, McDonald's slashed prices and then obliquely attacked Taco Bell's food in advertising. A television commercial suggested that Taco Bell had low prices but nothing to eat but beans.
McDonald's will raise the stakes early next year by introducing a new value pricing plan that may include long-term price cuts and other menu changes, a spokesman said.
More common tactics have been short-term discounts like McDonald's selling Big Macs for 99 cents, about 80 cents off the regular price. Fast-food analysts have warned of the dangers of discount pricing, which can cut drastically into earnings.
 
The Discount Leader
 Prices on Taco Bell's offerings have been reduced for the long term, not temporarily. Most of Taco Bell's products are offered on a special menu for one of three prices: 59 cents, 79 cents or 99 cents. So the chain has emerged as the industry's discount leader.
"If you look around in the hospitality industry you see a lack of differentiation and a lot of customer confusion -- 99 cents for this, 59 cents for that," said Simon Crawford-Welch, an industry consultant, who is also an assistant professor of hospitality at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. "But with Taco Bell, I know what I get."
Kevin K. Moriarty, a former Burger King executive who is now president of the Del Taco chain, credits Taco Bell with returning common sense to the industry. He said that to attract customers many chains had added menu items that cost more and took longer to prepare.
"Taco Bell has structured its menu and operations around speed and volume, and as a result, it's growing at the big guys' expense," Mr. Moriarty said.
Mr. Martin and Pepsico, already a force in the fast-food business with its Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut chains, worked to make Taco Bell more efficient. The value menu was introduced nationally in 1989 and that year the number of customer transactions increased 35 percent. Per-store sales have also jumped considerably to about $780,000.
 
Product Innovations
 Another Pepsico subsidiary, Frito-Lay, developed a taco shell that did not crumble easily. And working with suppliers like IBP, a meat processor, Taco Bell developed a method of cooking and quick-freezing seasoned ground beef for tacos at outside sites to save kitchen space and restaurant salaries.
Taco Bell's systemwide sales for the first three quarters of 1990 are up 14.3 percent, to $1.6 billion. Operating profits from 1,900 company-owned stores and other income increased 26 percent, to $90.6 million, Pepsico said.
Taco Bell's low-priced strategy is linked strongly to efforts by Mr. Martin and other executives of Taco Bell and its parent company to turn around a business that was struggling in the years after Pepsico bought it in 1978 from its founder, Glen Bell. Mr. Bell started the chain in Southern California, and Pepisco has expanded eastward.
Taco Bell said there were several reasons for its past problems.
Many people were hesitant to try Mexican food, thinking it was strange or too spicy. The buildings were small and dour and often lacked a drive-through window. Taco Bell's roof signs reflected well the pace of business: They featured a sleeping man in a sombrero. Even employee uniforms were dull.
Mr. Martin, a former president of the Burger Chef chain, which is now part of Hardee's, joined Taco Bell as president in 1983 and began a remodeling and expansion program. He also began work on a marketing plan to convince Americans that tacos were as appealing as hamburgers.
The timing was right. Carl DeBiase, who runs Restaurant Trends, said that as Taco Bell was regrouping, supermarket shoppers were warming to the idea of cooking Mexican food at home.
"Here's a company that has been basically benefiting from the acceptance of their type of food," Mr. DeBiase said.
The plan started to work. Sales per store jumped from $539,000 in 1984 to about $579,000 by 1987. Fast-food eaters had begun to accept Taco Bell, but there was still a problem. They did not return frequently enough because prices seemed high for the amount of food they received. A taco was 79 cents. Many other items cost $1.65, and specialty items were as much as $2.99.
"So what we really were was a place for a change of pace, a place for a treat, but we wanted to be a place to eat every day," Mr. Martin said.
He said about a third of the fast-food customers account for 70 percent of business. They are the "heavy users," some of whom visit a fast-food restaurant nearly every working day. Taco Bell needed to attract these diners to increase sales and earnings significantly.
Solving the problem of offering better value to retain more customers took time. The company tried stuffing its burritos with more meat but that alienated the customers who liked smaller portions. Some restaurants also tried an all-you-can-eat promotion but that also failed.
The next idea was a 39-cent taco. "Our transactions went through the roof, but profitability went through the floor," Mr. Martin said.
But a taco at 49 cents made economic sense. Customers liked them because they could order three for lunch or take away six in box.
To give diners more variety, the company expanded the discount offering last year to five or six items at one price: 59 cents. To keep things simple -- and make more money -- the taco price was pushed up 10 cents.
 
$30 Billion Sales Goal
 When he became president, Mr. Martin announced ambitious sales goals. He predicted Taco Bell would have 4,000 restaurants and do $4 billion in business by the end of 1991. He now says he will come close to meeting that objective, expecting to have 3,500 to 3,600 restaurants doing an average $1 million a year in revenue. Now he is saying by the end of the year 2001 he will have 10,000 restaurants and other points of distribution such as stands and $30 billion in sales.
"We really think there are some large opportunities," he said. The most intriguing is a computer-driven machine the size of a coffee table that Mr. Martin says can make and seal in a plastic bag a perfect hot taco. The machine, he said, could be set up in airports, manned or unmanned, and other places to sell Taco Bell food.
Considering that possibility, Mr. Martin begins to muse further.

HEADLINE: On a Shoestring, a Catholic School Braces for Cuts

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
There is a room at St. Pius V School in the South Bronx in which everything was donated: the computers, the software, the paper, the chairs, the tables, even the dropped ceiling and the industrial carpet. The children are often supervised by volunteers.
On a walk through the school last week, the principal, Sister Mary Ellen Fuhrman, paused and reflected: "It's wonderful, isn't it? But it also leaves us with the disadvantage of having nothing to cut." 
 Like principals at more than 160 of the 243 Roman Catholic elementary schools in the Archdiocese of New York, Sister Mary Ellen has been scouring her school building for economies to try to meet an anticipated reduction in subsidies. The archdiocese, which covers Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester and six other counties to the north, has announced that it will reduce the aid it gives to poor parishes by nearly 50 percent, from $11 million to $6 million.
Today is the deadline for schools like St. Pius to submit plans for the cuts to the education office of the archdiocese. As of late last week, however, Sister Mary Ellen's school had found nothing to cut. "We're already down to bone," said the Rev. Paul LeBlanc, the pastor of the St. Pius V Parish, which includes the school and an adjacent church, rectory and convent. He noted that the school, with 245 pupils in nine grades, has a staff of just 11 -- 9 teachers, a principal and a secretary. "Where do you cut?" he asked.
 
Many Volunteers
 The rest of the workers at the school are volunteers, mostly mothers of pupils and members of the parish church. One mother acts as the security guard, standing at the door of the faded brick school, built in 1913, which is marred by graffiti and worn by age. St. Pius is located at East 144th Street at Willis Avenue, next to a rubble-strewn lot with a sign that promises construction by a date long past.
Another mother serves as an aide in the kindergarten. Other parents volunteer in the lunch room, the computer room and the playground -- a narrow space between the school and the church that does not offer much room for play but provides sanctuary from the stray bullets and drug dealers in the neighborhood. A hand-held bell announces the end of recess. "Not high tech," the pastor said, "but it works."
 
Plumbing and Carpentry
 There is a guidance counselor at the school who serves both parents and children, but her salary does not come from the school's $343,000 annual budget. The guidance office is staffed and paid for by an order of nuns, the Religious Sisters of Mercy.
One father provides free plumbing services, another donates his skills as an electrician. The most unusual volunteer may be Juan Ortiz, 41 years old, who is legally blind and works in the parish virtually full-time as a carpenter. Holding building materials just inches from his eyes, Mr. Ortiz has constructed desks, tables and shelves for books and toys. With the help of an aide, he has installed ceilings and partitioned rooms. Mr. Ortiz said he was grateful for the opportunity to help. "I feel good about it and they feel good about it," he said. "That's the best pay I can get."
Father LeBlanc, the 47-year-old son of a carpenter, is also handy with a hammer and saw. He built computer tables for the school and laid new wooden tiles on a classroom floor.
Alba Torres, who has three children at St. Pius, is one of eight mothers who consistently spend the entire school day there as volunteers. "You can see they need a lot of help," she said. "This is not like a public school where there is lots of money to throw at the problems."
While there are volunteers aplenty, money for materials is scarce. As a result, Father LeBlanc spends a lot of time writing letters to businesses that are moving or remodeling their offices and to stores that are having clearance sales. The letters begin like this: "We are a poor school in the South Bronx and we are in desperate need of . . ."
When St. Pius submits its budget plan to the archdiocese today, there will be no cuts in the school program, Father LeBlanc said. Instead, the school will propose raising tuition $10 a month and embarking on an aggressive fund-raising campaign that will go beyond the traditional candy sales and raffles to reach corporations, foundations and philanthropists.
Tuition at the school is $75 a month, or $750 a year; the price goes to $900 a year for two children from the same family and to $1,000 for three. While the tuition is low compared to the cost of other private schools, it represents a major sacrifice for many. Seventy percent of the families in the parish earn less than $15,000 a year.
The archdiocese has grouped St. Pius with three neighboring Catholic schools -- St. Jerome's, St. Luke's and Immaculate Conception -- to map out financial plans. Since the schools are among the poorest in the city and receive large subsidies from the archdiocese, the cuts are particularly severe, reducing the total annual subsidy for the four schools from $488,000 to $244,000.
The four schools, with a combined pupil population of 1,460, held an emergency meeting last Monday night that drew more than 600 parents. While there was concern, there was little anger expressed toward the archdiocese.
"The prevailing mood is of sadness, not of protest or anger," said Father John O. Grange, the pastor of St. Jerome's. "The archdiocese has poured millions into the area. It is time for us to do more."
While the archdiocese has raised the specter of school closings, the South Bronx pastors and principals said that they were confident that the archbishop, John Cardinal O'Connor, would do everything to keep their schools open.
"We are the anchors in this community," said Father Grange. "I can't image this neighborhood without our schools. If we were to close, the South Bronx would become a howling wasteland."

HEADLINE: Brady's View Of Recession

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that the economy was heading toward a significant economic slowdown, but that a recession was "no big deal."
"I don't think it's the end of the world even if we have a recession," Mr. Brady said. "We'll pull back out of it again. No big deal."
Mr. Brady, interviewed on the NBC program "Meet The Press," said the difficulty was in predicting how long the slowdown would last. He predicted the economy would return to "a good strong level some time in 1991."
The Treasury Secretary called on the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, to lower interest rates to help the economy.
"I think there's ample room for further reduction in interest rates," Mr. Brady said. "I hope he will do it."
Mr. Brady said further measures intended to help get the economy out of its downturn would be disclosed in February, but would not include more taxes. "The President is not going to raise taxes in 1991," he said.

HEADLINE: Banking's Reins: Too Tight and Too Loose

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Stunned and sobered by the savings and loan debacle, Washington is determined to protect taxpayers from a second skinning -- this time at the hands of failing commercial banks. Yesterday, L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, reaffirmed that determination, while painting the bleakest portrait yet of the banking industry.
But many private economists, who are a step removed from the political scramble, caution that there is more to successful bank reform than defending the public purse. 
 America's banks, they argue, are economic dinosaurs that are rapidly losing in the Darwinian struggle to make money by lending money. If banks are to serve as reliable caretakers of the nation's money supply, they need greater leeway to cut costs and diversify services while simultaneously being held to far tougher standards of financial accountability.
It is no great mystery how that might be managed. The Treasury is said to be considering a number of proposals that analysts say would make banks more efficient, yet more responsive to safety concerns. These include tying deposit insurance to the riskiness of banks' investments and sharply restricting the sorts of investments banks may make.
But getting from here to there, argues Lawrence White, an economist at New York University, "is bound to be a messy business" as banks are forced to live -- or die -- by the economic logic of markets rather than the political logic of regulation.
Banks are go-betweens, earning most of their daily bread by channeling the nation's savings into bricks, mortar and machines. The more aggressive and efficient they are, the more money they make.
But banks are also public utilities of a sort: repositories of cash, processors of tens of billions of dollars in checks and electronic drafts each day. Dullness, here, is a virtue. And as Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution, contends, it is the tension between these two roles that has brought the banking system and its regulators to such grief.
 
Need for Security
 Economies work more efficiently when the payments system is very secure, when depositors need not worry about whether the money is where they left it and when the amount of money in private hands is not subject to sharp, unexpected fluctuations.
That is why the Federal Reserve stands ready to lend to solvent banks that are short of cash. At least in part, it is also why Washington so long tried to protect banks from competition and guaranteed most depositors against losses. It also explains why some banks -- notably, Continental Illinois in Chicago -- were deemed too large to fail, even after they had badly mismanaged their loans.
The lenders that evolved in this heavily, but spottily, regulated system were inefficient. But the system muddled through, Mr. White says, because banks were assured of both cheap deposits from people with few other options on where to put their money and a steady demand for loans from low-risk borrowers like big corporations in need of working capital and home buyers with hefty down payments.
Since the mid-1970's, however, the conflict in the banks' dual role has become all too apparent. Fierce competition from money market funds forced banks to pay higher interest on deposits and made this cost less predictable from month to month.
In the meantime, blue-chip borrowers discovered they could raise capital more cheaply by selling short-term debt securities to pension and mutual funds. "Nobody needed a bank to certify that General Motors was creditworthy," notes George Benston, an economist at Emory University.
 
Problems in Consumer Loans
 And to make matters even worse, profits were souring on loans to consumers for houses, cars and credit cards. Margins on these loans were shaved razor thin when banks discovered they could be packaged as securities and resold to big institutional investors.
At first glance, the banks' subsequent rush into high-risk bonds, commercial real estate and third world debt looks foolish. But to Mr. Litan it seems a natural response for an industry that has for so long been a creature of regulation.
Once hard times stripped away their thin veneer of capital, banks had nothing more to lose by betting the depositors' money on ever more risky projects. Indeed, Mr. White notes, they had much to gain: Fees from new loans would allow them to pay salaries and dividends while they waited for really big payoffs to restore their institutions' solvency.
Depositors never squawked because Uncle Sam insured their accounts to $100,000, sometimes for far more. And as has become painfully obvious in recent months, Federal and state regulators bred to the somnolent culture of monopoly banking were hardly up to the task of closing the bar at so popular a party.
 
Some Possible Solutions
 Congress and the White House now seem determined to prevent commercial bank depositors from following their savings and loan counterparts to the public trough. But what should be done about it?
Mr. White of New York University says one oft-mentioned fix, a doubling or tripling of deposit insurance premiums, would raise banks' costs and accelerate the decline in their competitive position as lenders. Another, a cutback in the maximum deposit eligible for insurance, would clash directly with the objective of preventing bank panics and stabilizing the nation's money supply. "No other industrialized country," Professor Benston of Emory asserts, "would allow depositors to lose money."
Yet another concept that is enjoying a day in the political sun is the "risk-related" insurance premium, or a variant, the risk-related capital requirement. Insisting that premiums be related to risk "is one way to inject market forces in bank decisions," notes Robert Eisenbeis of the University of North Carolina's business school. If, for example, a fixed-rate home mortgage were five times as risky as a short-term loan to I.B.M., let the bank pay proportionately to insure the source of the funds.
Washington is, in fact, already committed by international treaty to linking minimum capital reserves to crude benchmarks of risk: Treasury securities, for example, would require no backing, while mortgages would require a 4 percent capital cushion. A similar approach in deposit insurance would raise the incentive of banks to think twice before taking a plunge.
 
How to Rate Risks
 But Mr. White points out that the science of rating investment risks is quite primitive. Among other problems, a simple categorization plan would not penalize especially risky investments within broad categories like commercial real estate; nor would it reward diversification that reduced risks. What is more, risk-related premiums would not discourage banks that are already insolvent from continuing to gamble.
Perhaps the most sweeping approach to reform, in vogue a few years ago when banks were keen to expand into other financial fields, is "narrow banking." Banks that wanted Federal deposit insurance would be permitted to invest only in low-risk liquid assets like Government bonds, whose value could be easily tracked by regulators.
That would solve the immediate problems of securing the payments system and keeping the deposit insurance fund in the black. And "it would probably make sense if we were starting from scratch," said Paul Horvitz, an economist at the University of Houston. But today it would lead to wrenching, if temporary, economic dislocations as banks dropped their conventional loan businesses.
Herbert Baer, an assistant vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, talks of a potentially more serious risk: the development of a parallel payments system, one beyond the control of regulators or the protection of deposit insurance.
Money market mutual funds, with hundreds of billions in deposits, already serve many of the functions of checking accounts. If the assets of regulated banks were more tightly controlled, the interest banks could afford to pay on deposits would be reduced and the incentives for placing money elsewhere would be increased.
Such drawbacks have pushed analysts toward common ground, if not true consensus. Most want to dismember costly rules that prevent banks from operating across state lines or offering financial services like securities underwriting. But in return they would insist that banks erect a far sturdier wall of capital between depositors and the Federal deposit insurance fund, and require regulators to close banks long before this buffer is breached.
 
A Special Layer of Debt
 Mr. Baer goes a step further, envisioning a second buffer: a layer of uninsured deposits or private debt that could be repaid only after depositors are made whole. This, he notes, would give one group of bank investors a strong incentive to blow the whistle on incompetent practices before the bank had lost enough money to become a ward of the Federal deposit insurance fund.
Mr. Litan of the Brookings Institution would embellish this solution with an objective market test: If a bank could not issue uninsured debt for a reasonable premium above the interest rate the United States Treasury pays, it would be shut. Using similar logic, Lawrence Wall of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta would insist that banks stand ready to buy back their subordinated debt within a reasonable time or face closure.
It is widely agreed that banks are less than eager to raise tens of billions of dollars of new capital. Some would not be able to find investors and would be driven out of business.
But of all the possible approaches to bank reform, Mr. Benston argues, this one is the least intrusive and the least likely to be corrupted in practice by bankers and members of Congress. And for larger banks it would come with a special sweetener: the ability to cut costs by broadening their reach and diversifying their services.
In any case, notes Mr. Eisenbeis of the University of North Carolina, a principal objective of healthy banks is to shield themselves from the consequences of the next, almost inevitable round of bank failures. With taxpayers sure to resist picking up the tab, the added cost of carrying more capital would be a modest price for such protection.

HEADLINE: Ruling Highlights a Rift Among Blacks

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The announcement that the Government considers scholarships designated exclusively for minority students to be illegal has highlighted a rift between established civil rights groups and a small but growing number of blacks who question whether members of racial minorities should get preferential treatment.
In making the decision on the scholarships, Michael L. Williams, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the Education Department, stunned the education establishment, infuriated civil rights groups and moved Mr. Williams from being a well-regarded but obscure official to a political lightning rod. 
 The decision also surprised President Bush and the White House, and with an eye to already strained relations with black voters, Mr. Bush ordered a review of Mr. Williams's action. Some Administration officials predicted that the President would reverse or water down the policy this week.
In an interview last week after the policy became the center of attention in Washington, Mr. Williams said his decision came about solely by "looking at the law," the Civil Rights Act of 1964. "We should start with the general principle that significant decisions should not be based on race," he said. "There is no grand design in all this. For good or bad, this is me."
 
Debate on Affirmative Action
 But whether or not Mr. Williams intended it, his decision exposed the heated debate among blacks over whether affirmative action policies, aimed at correcting historical segregation, have instead created an unfair racial privilege.
Kay James, a black who is a former Assistant Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the principles behind Mr. Williams's ruling "resonate very well within the black community because most African Americans don't want race-based preferential treatment."
She added: "We want a level playing field, and once given that we can compete very well given that we have the intellect, the skills, the experience to accomplish anything we want. We would have rather decisions based on that rather than race."
But Janell Byrd, assistant counsel with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said that few blacks shared that position.
"Our phones have been ringing off the hooks with protests from everyone from cab drivers to civil rights organizations," she said. "I think that it is fair to say that Mr. Williams doesn't represent the black community."
Mr. Williams, who is black, played down the impact of his policy, pointing out that the ruling does not affect federally backed programs for minority members, private grants directed at minority members or scholarships directed at correcting past inequities.
"I've said on a number of occasions, it is not minority scholarships that are illegal," he said, "but race-exclusive scholarships. If we base financial aid on merit and need, think about who are going to be the neediest applicants on campus. For the most part they're going to be minority students."
 
Way to Preserve Scholarships
 Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp said today that Mr. Bush would find a way to preserve race-based scholarships that are linked to students' financial needs. Speaking on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," he said that Mr. Williams's interpretation of the law did not rule out scholarships based on race and financial need. "I think that is what ultimately is going to be the case," he said.
Mr. Williams said he discussed the policy with low-level staff members and cleared it with Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos and the department's legal office, but did not seek White House approval. Mr. Cavazos resigned last week, but Administration officials said there was no connection between the scholarship decision and Mr. Cavazos's departure.
Mr. Williams said his decision on the scholarships reflected one of several top issues for his office, including discrimination in admissions, discrimination against minority students with limited English, racial harassment on college campuses and sexual discrimination in intercollege athletics.
Mr. Williams's agenda was welcomed earlier this year by civil rights and education groups who viewed his arrival as a fresh wind in a moribund agency. But these groups say his latest action aligns him politically with the conservatives who dominated the Education Department during the tenure of former Secretary William J. Bennett in the Reagan Administration.
Mr. Williams's decision comes on the heels of other actions by the Bush Administration that have upset some black voters. Earlier this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a civil rights bill, contending that it would force businesses to impose racial quotas, an assertion that Democrats denied. The issue of quotas was also prominent in this year's election campaigns in North Carolina, Louisiana and California, as Republican candidates sought to paint Democrats as proponents of employment policies that give unfair advantage to women and minority members.
 
'Help Us Disarm Racists'
 Some black conservatives argue that racially based scholarships must be re-examined or they will become the focal point for resentment by white voters during an economic downturn.
"It's a good thing in a sense that there's an attack on quotas," said Walter E. Williams, a black economist at George Mason University, "because it will help us disarm racists around the country who use these things for their means. A lot of whites couldn't get a scholarship under any circumstances, but a racist will be able to exploit the present situation by saying, 'You weren't able to get one because they're giving them away to blacks.' "
He also suggested that the debate over racial quotas and preferences diverts attention from other issues. "If the black civil rights establishment cares anything about black kids being on campus, they would better focus their attention on the grossly fraudulent education going on in school." said Dr. Williams, who is not related to the assistant secretary.
"The paucity of black kids on college campuses has less to do with racial discrimination than it has to do with them being ill-prepared by the public schools," Dr. Williams said.
 
Gains Are Tainted, Some Say
 Others, like Shelby Steele, a black scholar whose criticism of affirmative action has received wide attention in the past year, say racial preferences diminish the achievements of blacks, whose gains are tainted by the appearance of favoritism.
Robert L. Woodson Sr., the founder of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a nonprofit organization in Washington that helps low-income people take over public housing, lamented that Republicans and conservative whites with dismal civil rights records are the ones raising the issue of civil rights and affirmative action. He argued that that stifles legitimate debate among blacks on civil rights strategies.
"If we are disappointed that Williams and a Republican Administration is raising these kind of challenges, then we ought to raise these challenges ourselves," Mr. Woodson said.
Mr. Woodson said civil rights groups should look again at whom their policies help. "To say we've got 15 slots for blacks and then not have any other definitions doesn't pit white against black, it pits upper-class blacks against low-income blacks," he said.
But Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, a moderate politician seen by many as representing a new black pragmatism, said the scholarship programs had "accomplished much toward providing increased access for minority students who seek to pursue higher education."
In a letter to Mr. Bush on Thursday, Mr. Wilder said Mr. Williams's ruling would have "a chilling effect on all minority-targeted programs," and he urged the President to reverse the policy.

Williams, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the Education Deparment. Last week the Government ruled that scholarships based solely on race were illegal.

HEADLINE: San Francisco's Chinatown Seeks to Save Its Soul

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Here on the streets where tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants gained a first foothold in America, their descendants are faced with a wrenching and divisive prospect: the demise of Chinatown.
Until now, Chinatown has simultaneously been a poor ghetto of elderly and newly arrived immigrants, a center of the garment industry, a tourist mecca in a city whose main industry is tourism and the economic, social and religious heart for the estimated 200,000 San Franciscans of Chinese descent. 
 The United States' most densely populated area outside Manhattan, it is honored throughout the Pacific Rim as a landmark in Asian history, having served as a haven from racist persecution and a base where Sun Yat-sen plotted the overthrow of the Manchu dynasty.
 
Fighting Sameness
 But along the main tourist thoroughfare, Grant Avenue, stores selling Chinese products from fine jade to cheap curios have given way to camera and video equipment shops. Boarded-up storefronts alternate with stores selling the same inexpensive T-shirts sold all over town. There are outlets of hamburger and cookie chain stores and even two shops selling Wild West gear.
Judge Harry W. Low of the California State Court of Appeal and national President of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, said, "The question is, 'Is Chinatown going to remain a unique area with a special history, food and other attractions said or just another place full of camera and T-shirt shops?' "
Judge Low's question is particularly pertinent. In 1991, 300 buildings housing 700 small businesses and thousands of low-cost apartments face state deadlines requiring the installation of special earthquake bracing. The work, intended to anchor floors to walls and prevent roofs from collapsing, will require dislocations and some temporary closures that could force many people out of Chinatown permanently. What will replace them is unknown.
The debate is so heated and confused that even community stalwarts are expressing doubts about whether the nation's first Chinatown can be saved as both a vital Asian community and a lucrative tourist attraction.
"I break out in a cold sweat every time I think about it," said Rose Pak, a consultant with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and a longtime advocate for Chinatown. "We are at a crossroads. I've never been so concerned and apprehensive. I'm thinking for the first time, maybe it's time to move on."
 
Collapse of a Lifeline
 Change is coming from many directions, from skyrocketing rents that drive out small family businesses to an exodus of middle-class Chinese to the suburbs. But the most obvious blow to the area's economic health was last year's earthquake. Not only did it damage some buildings beyond repair and necessitate expensive changes in others, but it also closed a community lifeline: the Embarcadero Freeway, which brought streams of shoppers from the suburbs every day.
The freeway remains closed, and intense disagreement over its future has driven a wedge deep into the community.
"We had a big fight," said May Louie, an owner of several import shops and president of the new Chinatown Merchants Association, which formed in a protest of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. The break came when the Chamber stopped supporting immediate repair of the freeway, considered by many Chinatown merchants vital to economic survival, and agreed to support the Mayor's long-term plan to tear it down and create a surface roadway.
"I call them all wimps," Mrs. Louie said.
Others argue that the estimated 20 percent downturn in business after the earthquake merely revealed a set of deeper, more complex problems that the community had been avoiding.
 
Moving On and Out
 "It's a superficially simple question to ask whether fixing the freeway is the solution," said James Ho, a Chinatown restaurateur who is San Francisco's Deputy Mayor for economic development. "The earthquake simply brought a lot of changes to the surface."
Mr. Ho cited "unconscionable" rents, garbage, crime and immigration of poor, rural Chinese lacking business skills as some of Chinatown's problems.
Equally important, he said, has been the flight of the middle class to the suburbs and to San Francisco's Richmond district, known in recent years as "New Chinatown," where the children of immigrants have bought homes and opened shops catering to their needs.
"Chinatown is the mother who has created a lot of kids," Mr. Ho said. "Its demise is because of how successful it has been as the beachhead for those who move on."
 
Cleanliness vs. Sterility
 New Chinese restaurants popular with tourists and suburbanites have opened outside Chinatown, where floor space and parking are abundant. Their owners not only enjoy lower rents, but also avoid Chinatown's garbage and traffic problems.
"Caucasians have become more sophisticated about Chinese food," said Henry Chan, president of the Yank Sing company, which operates a popular dim sum restaurant in the city's financial district. "They demand high quality and cleanliness. We really need to clean up Chinatown."
Mr. Chan said he had proposed a task force to insure compliance with city sanitation codes.
But some worry that such efforts may go too far, transforming the community into a sort of Oriental theme park.
"The danger is that everyone wants to fix it up and it becomes a Disneyland where people can't afford to live," Mr. Ho said.
Ms. Pak agreed. "We don't want it to become a shopping mall," she said. "This is a living community with markets selling live fish and poultry and fresh produce on the sidewalks. Where else can you get that? We want to protect the integrity of the community and also serve the tourists."
 
Crime Grows and Changes
 Concern over the rising number of robberies, pickpocketings and other petty thefts has also kept tourists away. Last spring, open warfare between Asian gangs broke out for the first time in over a decade with street shootings that left two dead and nine wounded. The authorities believe that the killings, which remain unsolved, are part of a power struggle to control illegal gambling parlors and drug trade.
Chinatown elders negotiated a truce, arguing that the gangs were hurting their own community, Judge Low said. But changes in immigration have brought in young toughs from the refugee populations of Vietnam. These young men, who have no ties to Chinatown or its leaders, joust with others in enforcing collections and other extortion activities.
Judge Low said he recently met with leaders of New York City's Chinese-American community, who reported that despite gang activities, Manhattan's Chinatown had not experienced a similar economic decline.
"It was jam packed with activity at 10 P.M. on a weeknight," Judge Low said. "It was quite a contrast to San Francisco."
 
Nervous Hong Kong Investors
 Paul Yee, the president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in New York, said the community was being infused with money from more affluent Hong Kong immigrants who are concerned about investing in San Francisco's Chinatown. "They say they are afraid of the earthquakes and are settling here instead," he said.
In San Francisco's Chinatown, power has rested in the hands of the 140-year-old Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, an all-male hierarchy of Chinatown's dozens of fraternal, district, family, business, and charity organizations that is informally known as the Six Companies. Its strength comes from the family associations, which own about 35 percent of the property in Chinatown.
Women have been excluded from the boards of the family and district associations and in some cases are confined to women's auxiliaries. No woman has ever held a position on the board of the Six Companies. "There is a lot of talent out there that is not being utilized," said Judge Low. If women are not allowed on the boards, he said, "new organizations will come forward and challenge them."
For now, the question has become whether the community can pull together to save itself.
"There's going to be more and more restaurants and businesses closed because they need the outside people," said Dennis Wong, a pharmacist who has owned a small drug-store in Chinatown for 20 years and who sits on the board of directors of both the Six Companies and the new Chinatown Merchants Association. "They can't get by on Chinatown residents alone. There's going to be some survival of the fittest going on."

HEADLINE: American Airlines Agrees to Buy London-U.S. Routes From T.W.A.

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Trans World Airlines agreed yesterday to sell its six routes between the United States and London to American Airlines for $445 million -- the latest sign that the country's strongest airlines are taking advantage of the troubles of their weaker rivals to acquire lucrative international routes.
T.W.A.'s chairman, Carl C. Icahn, quickly made clear his plans for that money, immediately renewing his attempt to acquire Pan American World Airways. 
 Last month Pan Am agreed to sell its London routes to United Airlines for $400 million. After the announcement of that deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, American said it too was interested in buying Pan Am's London routes, and Mr. Icahn made an offer for Pan Am that its board virtually ignored.
Mr. Icahn's latest offer to buy Pan Am was not contingent on an end to the Pan Am-United deal, as he had stipulated in his earlier offer. He said yesterday that by combining Pan Am and T.W.A., cash could be raised by selling overlapping routes. "What we want is a critical mass," he added.
United States Government approval can take many months. If the deals are approved, United and American, the strongest United States carriers, will now compete head-to-head for business between London and the United States. Pan Am and T.W.A., the two American airlines that built their reputations through overseas travel but are now financially struggling, will no longer fly the most popular route.
"It is a continuation of the strong-getting-stronger trend," said John V. Pincavage, a partner with Transportation Group Ltd., an investment banking firm that specializes in airlines.
The gap has been growing between the strongest airlines and the weaker ones. Last year, Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection. Earlier this month, Continental Airlines did the same. Both airlines are owned by Continental Holdings Inc., the former Texas Air Corporation.
As the historical American "flag" carriers sell overseas routes, the buyers have been those carriers serving mostly domestic route networks. Such carriers have thrived since the deregulation of the American airline industry, which began in October 1978. United, American, Delta Air Lines Inc. and USAir Group Inc. have all established frequent service among many American cities and have each developed several "hub" airports, at which many passengers arriving from many different cities change planes for flights to their final destinations.
 
Direct Service by Rivals
 At the same time, partial deregulation of international air travel in the late 1970's has allowed more of T.W.A.'s and Pan Am's domestic competitors to offer direct service to foreign cities. American Airlines now offers, for example, nonstop service from Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina to Paris.
Two decades ago, a traveler from North Carolina would have been obliged to change planes, most likely in New York, and would probably have ended up flying Pan Am or T.W.A. across the Atlantic.
Yesterday's announcements were the latest round in a dramatic reshuffling of properties in recent months. With the sharp increase in fuel prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, weaker airlines were in distress even as a lagging economy led to a drop in traffic. "The assets that are the most valuable are the ones that go first," Mr. Pincavage said.
T.W.A.'s deal with American also calls for the sale of all its operations in Chicago, as well as those at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports in London, for $70 million. T.W.A., which dominates the St. Louis market, has relatively modest operations in Chicago.
 
Access Sought for Eight Years
 Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of the AMR Corporaton, which owns American Airlines, said the airline had been seeking access to Heathrow, where landing rights are at a premium, for eight years.
American said it would use existing lines of credit and would sell some common stock in the first quarter of next year to pay for the T.W.A. deal.
American's acquisition of T.W.A.'s routes into London and United's deal with Pan Am may well cause the British Government to scrutinize the impact of the changes of ownsership of the routes. "What is going to be the most interesting in all of this is to see what the British Government is going to do," Mr. Pincavage said.
Under a treaty between Britain and the United States, only British Airways, Pan Am, T.W.A. and their "corporate successors" can fly trans-Atlantic routes out of Heathrow Airport.
 
Letter to Pan Am Chairman
 Mr. Icahn, in a letter sent yesterday to the chairman of the Pan Am Corporation, which owns the airline, Thomas G. Plaskett, appeared to be increasing the pressure. "Tom, given the current state of the airline industry in general and the state of Pan Am in particular," he wrote, "it is incumbent on you and your board of directors to allow shareholders of Pan Am, to whom you and your board have a fiduciary responsiblity, to choose for themselves whether or not they wish to avail themselves of the opportunity I have offered."
Mr. Icahn said he was increasing the cash portion of his bid for Pan Am to $1.50 a share, with $1 in notes. The notes would trade at a large discount from their face value. In November, T.W.A. offered $1 in cash and $2 in notes.
Pan Am's stock closed Friday at $1.25 a share, down 12.5 cents. The stock of UAL, which owns United, dropped $2.375, to $106.50, while AMR's stock fell $1.75 to $50. T.W.A. is privately owned, by Icahn & Company, which is based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., where Mr. Icahn lives.
Mr. Icahn would not say if he was prepared to make a tender offer for Pan Am's stock if the parent company's board reacts as it did to his earlier offer -- that is, basically to ignore it.
 
Analysts See Sense in Merger
 Analysts said a T.W.A.-Pan Am merger would make some sense. "You might be able to make a stronger 'one' out of the weaker two," Mr. Pincavage said. "You could have some excess assets to sell off," he said, but added that it would be nice if one of the airlines possessed a London route.
Both the Pan Am-United deal and the T.W.A.-American deals include joint marketing agreements, in which the airlines coordinate schedules to feed each other's flights and honor each other's frequent-flier arrangements. Some routes even overlap: both include flights to Heathrow from Los Angeles and from Kennedy and Newark International Airports in the New York area.
United is also acquiring the rights to fly from Washington, San Francisco and Seattle to London. American is also acquiring the rights to fly to Heathrow from Boston and Philadelphia. Last December, American had agreed to acquire T.W.A.'s Chicago-London route for $110 million. The expiration date for that agreement, which is still awaiting Government approval, was extended by today's agreement.
 
Concern Expressed by Skinner
 A flurry of deal-making in the airline industry last year prompted Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to send a letter to the presidents of 28 commercial airlines, expressing concern about the buying and selling of Government-granted international air route authorizations.
Lawrence M. Nagin, UAL's senior vice president and general counsel, said yesterday that he doubted that the completion of a second big international route sale agreement in two months would affect his company's plans. "United's Pan Am agreement stands on its own, and United is optimistic that Department of Transportation approval will be quickly forthcoming," he added.
Mr. Nagin declined to comment on how American's move might affect United's marketing. International routes are particularly valuable because the overseas markets are growing faster than domestic ones, and analysts said American would be able to take far better advantage of the London routes than would T.W.A., which is losing millions of dollars a month.
American has one of the strongest frequent-flier programs and computerized reservation systems in the country. "They have a better ability to fill up planes going to London than T.W.A.," Mr. Pincavage said.
 
Icahn Cites Drop in Earnings
 The London routes were probably one of the few areas in which T.W.A. was making significant profits, analysts said. Yet, Mr. Icahn, in a statement, said the earnings from these routes had deteriorated in the last two years and that, with new competition from United, the earnings would almost certainly continue to erode.
T.W.A. is currently one of the weakest airlines in the country, with a fleet of aging planes and debts estimated at more than $2 billion.
For the first nine months of the year, T.W.A. lost $54.3 million on revenues of $3.58 billion. Pan Am, another very weak airline, lost $268 million on revenues of $3 billion for the first nine months of the year.
AMR, on the other hand, earned $175.5 million on revenues of $8.7 billion for the first nine months of 1990. UAL earned $217.9 million, mostly through the sale of property, on revenues of $8.2 billion for the first nine months.
 
A Long History
 T.W.A. was one of the early success stories of American aviation. Founded on July 13, 1925, as Western Air Express, it grew during the 1920's and 1930's as a major carrier of air mail as well as passengers. Howard Hughes became T.W.A.'s principal shareholder in April 1939, and in the years immediately after World War II built a globe-girdling set of international routes. Mr. Icahn gained control of the company in late 1985 and became its chairman the following year.
A spokesman for British Airways P.L.C., the largest carrier between the United States and Britain with 37 percent of the market, declined to comment last night on the American-T.W.A. deal, other than to say, "We will remain competitive."
British Airways has a joint marketing agreement with United that the two companies have said they will retain after United buys Pan Am's routes to London.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST BLOOMFIELD, Mich., Dec. 16

 BODY:
A more unlikely picture could hardly be imgined than one in which Jewish American supporters of Israel and American descendants of Iraqi Christians socialize over coffee and danish at a Jewish temple, expressing their worries about the Persian Gulf crisis with neighborly warmth.
How that came to be is a story of how two groups are learning to live together in a neighborhood, not a story about politics. 
 If any ethnic group in the Detroit area is as prosperous, upwardly mobile and communal as the Jews of Detroit's northwestern suburbs, it must surely be the Chaldeans, Christians whose ancestors came from Iraq.
The ancestors of both groups arrived in Detroit decades ago and opened small shops and grocery stores. As the families prospered, they began to migrate, first to Southfield and Oak Park, and then farther northwest to Bloomfield Hills, Birmingham, Farmington Hills and West Bloomfield.
Today, about 50,000 to 60,000 Chaldeans live in the Detroit area. The Jewish population is a little larger.
Despite striking similarities in their histories and economic progress, the two groups socialized mainly among themselves. But, increasingly in this affluent suburban area, members of the two groups are finding themselves to be neighbors, classmates and colleagues.
A year ago, a little more of the distance between the two groups began to close when the Chaldean-Iraqi Association of Michigan bought the Shenandoah Golf and Country Club, which is directly across the street from Temple Israel, a Reform Jewish synagogue.
A minor contretemps ensued. Some homeowners objected to the purchase, saying it could bring further development. It was never clear whether those objecting were Jewish, but some Chaldeans sensed prejudice.
Saad Marouf, who immigrated to this country from Iraq in 1973, said there was much discussion among Chaldeans at the time about the homeowners' motives. "When you feel you are being rejected, you feel many things," he said.
But the opposition wasn't vigorous or long-lasting, and the Chaldeans spent about $1 million renovating the clubhouse and the golf course.
During the dispute, Temple Israel leaders recalled that 11 years earlier they had had to fight a legal battle for permission to build the temple.
"They told us the neighbors didn't want noise and traffic," said Harold Orbach, Temple Israel's cantor. "But I think there were ethnic considerations."
So to welcome the Chaldeans, Temple Israel organized a program of Jewish and Chaldean songs and dances, followed by interfaith noshing in the social hall. About 1,000 people, evenly divided between the two groups, attended.
Over coffee and pastry, many temple members asked how their Chaldean neighbors viewed the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In several such conversations, Chaldeans said that Mr. Hussein had contributed money to their churches here and that, although they had misgivings about his actions in Kuwait, they would not discuss their views openly for fear of reprisals against relatives in Iraq.
But there also was talk of possible future cooperation, like care for the elderly. As Charles Tobias, the temple's president, said, "We will have missed an opportunity to reach the full potential of this relationship if we don't pursue programs together for social action, for our youth and other areas."
And while the Jews and Chaldeans of West Bloomfield spoke of working to solve their differences, there were the inevitable thoughts of their common roots in the Middle East.
Mr. Marouf and many other Chaldeans are descended from families in and around the village of Talkaif. The village is less than 20 miles from Ur, where Abraham is said to have grown up and embraced monotheism.
"This is why we call the Jews our cousins," Mr. Marouf said.

HEADLINE: Recession Darkens Christmas Shopping Spirit

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
There is the spirit of Christmas, and in a recession, its corollary: the often dispiriting act of Christmas shopping.
"It seems a little grimmer this year," said Lilian Benesevich, 34 years old, an insurance company executive from Hartford, who has made a tradition of shopping in Manhattan with her college roommate every Christmas. 
 They sat together Saturday on a near-empty charter bus that ferried American Express card holders down Fifth Avenue free of charge. The bus paused briefly before the opulent windows of Saks Fifth Avenue, as well as those of an out-of-business B. Altman's, blackened windows that looked like a tableau of Scrooge's Christmas Yet to Come. "There used to be more lights, more decorations," Ms. Benesevich noted. "Now, it's all clearance sales. It feels like January already."
 
'This Is the Worst Christmas'
 As the number of shopping days left before Christmas dwindle, shoppers and vendors in New York and across the nation talk of spending less, hunting for bargains, cutting frills and holding back on the holidays. Retailers are projecting what salespeople, Salvation Army volunteers and shoppers already know: Money, this year, is tight.
"This is the worst Christmas we've ever had in here," said Brunie Ciuz, a saleswoman who stood idly in John Gerald Jewelers in the Queens Central Mall in Elmhurst.
The stores that are crowded are packed with people who are there mostly to look. A long line formed early outside F.A.O. Schwarz, and inside, the aisles were jammed with shoppers, most of whom wore the dazed looks of museumgoers at a crowded art exhibit. Michael Spinelli, a house painter from Cleveland, picked up a stuffed bear, examined the $110 price tag and threw it back on the shelf as if it were radioactive. "The prices are mind boggling," he said. "I just don't see that many people buying."
Impulse buying, along with what retailers call "additional suggestive selling," coaxing customers to spend more, were figments of Christmas Past. "This year we're spending our money on necessities," said Robyn Cash, a fifth-grade teacher in District 9 in the Bronx, who went to Macy's to pick out her Christmas gift with her fiance, Joe Ragins. She chose a "good pair of shoes" and a shoe tree, "to keep them in shape and make them last."
Mr. Ragins, a sixth-grade teacher, also with District 9, said, "This is the 90's, and it seems it's going to be different."
 
Helpful Clerks, Nasty Customers
 Stores are less crowded, the price of most merchandise has been reduced, and shop assistants are downright helpful. "All the salespeople were really nice; I was shocked," said Randy Banner, a 37-year-old writer from Yonkers, who had gone to Neiman Marcus in White Plains on Saturday braced for rudeness. She had found her silver lining. "In the boom market of the 80's," she noted, "essentially you gave them money, and they told you, 'Drop dead.' "
But store employees reported that their customers' tempers seemed mainly nasty, brutish and short. "People are in bad moods, really rude," said a saleswoman in the appliances department of Bloomingdale's. On a distinctly unbusy Friday night, she stood with a fellow sales clerk, and they huddled like two police officers on a slow beat. "Customers seem to be bringing their problems and all the tension over the economy into the stores."
Salvation Army officers who were camped outside, as well as the growing armies of volunteers seeking donations for the homeless, reported scant success. "It's noticeable," said one Santa Claus, a homeless man who would identify himself only as Lorenzo, as he rang his bell for donations outside Bloomingdale's. "Fewer people stop. I see a lot of people walking by, worried."
Discount shops like Conway's and moderately priced stores like Abraham & Straus were filled, often with first-time customers seeking lower prices. "This is my first time in here," said one woman inspecting baby clothes marked under $10 in a Conway's on Broadway. She would not give her name, but noted, grimly, that her company was laying off workers.
 
Bloomingdale's? Saks? No Way
 "I'm spending a lot less this year," said Norma Gorycki, a bookkeeper from Medford, L.I., whose husband, a salesman, had been out of work for six months earlier this year. She was shopping at A.&S. and said she would not even enter Bloomingdale's or Saks. "I wouldn't go there any more than I would go into Tiffany's," she said indignantly. "It's far too expensive."
Even those who looked unassailably rich said they were exercising caution. "I'm planning on spending a lot less this year," said Bill Butler, an elegantly dressed 27-year-old insurance broker, as he carefully examined $19 Christmas novelty ties at Brooks Brothers. He noted that he was planning to use only cash. "I still owe on my credit cards, and it's one way of curtailing spending." He added with a self-conscious laugh, "I am still paying off the credit cards I built up in the 1980's."
Todd Lipscom, a sidewalk vendor who had customers crowding three-deep around his table outside of Macy's, reported that his business was up, despite Saturday's rain. "It's a quick pickup," he said of the piles of $10 "Gucci," "Hard Rock Cafe" and "I Love New York" sweatshirts. "The department stores can't beat these prices."
 
$700 Worth of Swatch Watches
 There were exceptions to the general rule of moody scrimping shoppers. Roger Cyr's flushed face and his overflowing jumbo-sized shopping bags stood out at Macy's. "I've spent $500 and I haven't even hit the expensive stuff yet," he announced happily. Mr. Cyr, who works for an insurance company in Stamford, Conn., said, "I know there is a recession, but it just hasn't hit home yet."
Foreign tourists, taking advantage of the weakened dollar, shopped with abandon. "I just had a gentleman buy $700 worth of Swatch watches," George Taylor, a floor supervisor at Bloomingdale's, noted with awe. "He was from Europe. He shook my hand and thanked me."
There were also those who spoke anxiously of the Persian Gulf. One middle-aged couple from Stuyvesant Town in lower Manhattan had gone to Bloomingdale's Friday night after a movie, "just for fun." But the ornaments, carols and yards of tinsel and twinkling lights failed to lift their spirits: They were in no mood to give their names. "Things are a little drearier, aren't they?" The husband said, hesitatingly. His wife explained, "We have an 18-year-old son. If we get into a war, then nobody will have a Christmas."
Even Santa Claus was subject to mood swings. Jean-Darcel Michel, 32, who is from Haiti, vigorously chanted "Ho, ho ho," as he ice-skated in the rain at Rockefeller Center on Saturday. Off the ice, water dripping from his plush velvet suit and cotton beard, he grew more sober. "I'm very much worried," he said. "I just switched jobs, I didn't make the union and I am watching what happens next."
His three children would not get the presents they wanted, he explained, nor would he be able to afford a Christmas tree. Then he rallied, unwilling to disgrace his red-and-white uniform. "We have no tree," he said, "but we'll have a good time anyway."

Narco-Terrorism
By Rachel Ehrenfeld
225 pages. Basic Books. $19.95.
Narco-terrorism, writes Rachel Ehrenfeld in this sobering if somewhat sketchy report, "is the use of drug trafficking to advance the objectives of certain governments and terrorist organizations."
In her paradigmatic case, a drug-producing subculture is offered protection by a politically radical organization. The organization sells the drugs to raise money for weapons and uses the weapons to promote revolution and to provide further protection for the drug producer. 
 "The major target for this deadly and illicit activity is and always has been the United States, as a natural consequence of economic and political factors," Ms. Ehrenfeld continues. "For the trafficker, the United States is the wealthiest and biggest consumer of illegal drugs in the world. The United States remains the 'main enemy' for the Marxist ideologue and other anti-democratic and anti-Western forces for whom drugs serve a threefold purpose. First, they destabilize American society; second, they undermine non-Marxist democratic governments in this hemisphere and elsewhere; and best of all, the results come at no cost to these regimes and their terrorist allies, since the whole enterprise in effect is paid for by the American and other Western drug consumers."
"As is always the case in these matters," she writes, "the proof for narco-terrorism is found in bits and pieces scattered across the globe. Some elements are missing. Some only can be surmised. And since I am not putting anyone on trial, the body of evidence is not airtight."
All the same, what she has assembled is "a mosaic in which the patterns are distinct enough to form substantial conclusions." This mosaic comprises countries like Bulgaria, Cuba, Lebanon, Syria, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. Typical of her survey is the Palestine Liberation Organization, which, she asserts, earns $300 million from the narcotics trade yearly, "approximately three times what it earned from supportive Arab regimes." In Peru, she writes, the Maoist guerrilla organization called the Shining Path exploits one of the world's richest sources of raw coca to finance its war against so-called Yankee imperialism and to win over the Indian population that harvests Peru's crop and constitutes the country's majority.
But almost equally to blame is the United States itself, whose rising demand for drugs continues to make narco-terrorism work. In her long polemical concluding chapter, "The Other America: From Grass to Crack," Ms. Ehrenfeld points an accusing finger at everything from the counterculture of the 1960's to Presidents like Jimmy Carter whom she considers drug-permissive to the sort of flabby thinking, as she sees it, that promotes the legalization of drugs.
Because America lacks the will to fight back, she argues, drugs have worked their way into every crevice of the country's life, and addiction will continue to rise, she says, until we acknowledge our true enemies.
Ms. Ehrenfeld, who has an advanced degree in criminology and is a research scholar at New York University's Law School, makes a powerful case on the whole, though there are certainly gaps in her logic. She tortures her argument somewhat to explain why President Fidel Castro's execution of General Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez for narcotics trafficking, among other sins, was done in part to cover up Mr. Castro's own involvement with narco-terrorism, and she goes to considerable lengths to explain why Colombia's drug trade isn't simply built on monumental greed and corruption.
In describing the cycle of drug use in the United States from the late 19th century to the 1930's, she neglects to mention the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, so that one cannot tell from her text that drug consumption was legal at the start of the cycle and illegal at the end of it, or that the revival of drug use beginning in the 1960's occurred despite prohibition being in effect. Similarly, in describing what she calls the failure of Britain's experiment with legalization, she neglects to mention that in at least some people's judgment addiction and drug-related crime have continued to rise since prohibition was reinstated in 1971.
Her case against legalization in America is based on extremely limited source material, and her fanciful projection of what would happen if drugs were legalized can be refuted by an equally plausible scenario that would prove just the opposite. In fact, no one knows whether consumption would rise or fall if drugs were decriminalized, nor can one even guess what drugs would prove most popular.
Nonetheless, by calling attention to what drugs have done to societies other than to the United States's, "Narco-Terrorism" serves powerfully to raise one's consciousness of their danger. If things seem bad now, just imagine what it would be like if the country were "Colombianized," which Ms. Ehrenfeld contends is not far from remote, what with drug enforcement agents becoming more accessible to corruption, at least in her view, and prosecutors finding it increasingly difficult to find witnesses willing to give evidence to drug crimes.
In her opinion, it is not enough just to say no. "Narco-terrorism should become a major issue in bilateral discussions in the international community, including the Soviets and their explicit and implicit allies," she concludes. "Terrorist organizations and other subversive groups have witnessed the success of the drug business and the failure of democratic governments to deal with the problem; in all probability, this will embolden them to continue business as usual."

Trevino Tops List in Earnings

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ

 BODY:
Lee Trevino finished in a tie for second place in the New York Life Champions tournament in Dorado, Puerto Rico, yesterday, earning $95,000 and pushing his earnings for the season to $1,190,518. That gave him more money for 1990 than the PGA Tour's leading money winner, Greg Norman, who earned $1,165,477.
Trevino thus became the first player in the 11-year history of the Senior Tour to exceed the money-winning total of the leader on the regular tour. 
 Trevino entered the tournament with $983,018 and had locked up $112,500 more in bonus money as the leading money winner on the Senior Tour. That put him $69,959 behind Norman, who received a $175,000 bonus as the leading money winner on the regular tour.
 
Herbert Wind Moves On
 Herbert Warren Wind, the distinguished golf and tennis writer for The New Yorker magazine for about 40 years, has announced his retirement from the weekly effective Jan. 1, 1991.
Wind, who is 74 years old, will continue to serve as the editor of the "Classics of Golf," an ongoing reprint series of significant books about the game.
Over the years, Wind's finely crafted 15,000 word pieces for The New Yorker were consistently the most comprehensive reports of the golf's annual major championships.
Wind is also the author of more than a dozen books, including, "The Story of American Golf," and the co-author of the instruction classic, "Ben Hogan's Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf," as well as Jack Nicklaus's autobiography, "The Greatest Game of All."
Wind, educated at Yale and Cambridge, was hired by The New Yorker as a full-time writer in 1947. He left the magazine for six years to work for the then-fledgling Sports Illustrated, but rejoined The New Yorker in 1962. Besides golf and tennis, Wind also wrote about football, hockey, basketball and other racquet sports for the magazine.
"I think I've just grown older, and I'm not as capable as I used to be," said Wind from his home in Weston, Mass. "But I think I will stay in golf for the rest of my life."
Robert Gottlieb, editor of The New Yorker, said no decision has been made as to whether the magazine will continue to cover golf in Wind's absence.
"We do not feel obliged to write about golf or any other particular subject, but, of course, if a wonderful writer comes along who wants to write about golf, we may very well take it up again," Gottlieb said.
 
Feeling the Pinch
 The downturn in the nation's economy is apparently beginning to have an impact on professional golf. The ailing Bank of Boston has pulled out as a sponsor on the PGA Tour, and the Bank of Boston Classic, scheduled for July 11-14 of 1991, will be known as the New England Classic.
On the L.P.G.A. tour, the Boston Five Classic is without a sponsor after the withdrawl of the Boston Five Cents Savings Bank. The event, tentatively scheduled for late July, is also searching for a site to play on.
In 1992, two major corporations, U.S.F. & G. and Shearson Lehman, will withdraw as sponsors of PGA Tour events in New Orleans and San Diego. Both companies announced that changes in top management caused the expenditures of golf sponsorship to be re-evaluated.
 
Eyes on the Masters
 The most watched golf telecast of the year belonged to the Masters, which earned a 10.5 rating on CBS. Next was the Doral Ryder Open (CBS), with a 6.0 rating, the Los Angeles Open (CBS) and the Skins Game (NBC), tied with a 5.9 rating, and the United States Open (ABC), with a 5.8 rating. The highest rated senior event was the United States Senior Open (ABC), with a 5.2 rating, while the highest-rated women's telecast was Nabisco Dinah Shore (NBC), which earned a 3.0 rating, the 31st highest among all golf telecasts. The lowest rated telecast was the Walt Disney World/Oldsmobile Classic (NBC), which received a 1.5 rating.

HEADLINE: Sanity or Suicide on Trade?

 BODY:
The Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations collapsed 10 days ago in Brussels when the European Community refused to cut back its protectionist food policy. Denied access to European markets, negotiators from third world food-exporting nations were left with no option other than to pack their bags.
The fallout from Brussels could turn ugly, and fast. Without rules to govern trade in agriculture, services and investment, countries will be free to accuse each other of unfair trade practices, and to unilaterally impose sanctions. Sanctions, in turn, invite retaliation. 
 The threat of escalating trade wars is no mere speculation: within days of the suspended talks in Brussels, the U.S. and several of its trading partners began saber rattling.
The U.S. is reportedly preparing to raise duties on European exports of food and beverages by 200 percent -- in part to retaliate against a European ban on pork and beef imports from the U.S. The Administration is also drawing up plans to retaliate against countries deemed to discriminate against U.S. companies selling financial services; Japan, South Korea and Brazil are the likely targets.
And without international trade rules for intellectual property, Washington will be pressured to impose sanctions on countries like Thailand that tolerate massive pirating of copyrighted and patented materials.
The United States won't be the only country to engage in unilateral sanctions. That's why international rules are important, and why the trade talks must be salvaged.
All sides must give. But the Europeans must give the most. The European Community could break the logjam by agreeing to phase out export subsidies. These allow European farmers to dump surplus food at subsidized prices on international markets, devastating third world farmers. The E.C. could insulate the rest of the world from its internal food policies in another important way: helping its farmers with direct income payments rather than with production subsidies.
For their part, the U.S. and other food-exporting countries could back off from demands that would require the Europeans to cut food supports by 75 percent or more. The E.C. agriculture policy is deeply ingrained, politically and economically. It needs to be phased down over time, not dismantled all at once.
The White House could also emphasize to the Europeans that it, too, is prepared to take a political beating by pushing through Congress a trade agreement that would undo an elaborate U.S. system of quotas on peanuts, sugar and textiles.
In Brussels, the E.C. -- at the insistence of President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany -- made an understandable but hardly noble political decision to protect its own farmers rather than protect world trade. If world trade is to flourish, the E.C. will have to find ways to do both.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
The Major Change

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
France and Germany have decided that the best way to create a regional European superpower is to launch an undeclared trade war on the United States.
That puts in plain, stark and understandable terms the meaning of a git-GATT-gittle that glazes the eyes when called "the collapse of the Uraguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade." 
 Here's how the war broke out. At last July's economic summit in Houston, France's Francois Mitterrand and Germany's Helmut Kohl assured President Bush that the talks to ease restrictions on world trade, going on for four years, would succeed. That meant a phase-out of the protection of French farmers that raised food prices and walled off our exports.
Ever the good schnook in dealing with our supposed allies, Mr. Bush embraced German unification and spoke glowingly of the new Europe as a trading partner. But France's farm lobby leaned on Mr. Mitterrand, who promptly caved; Mr. Kohl, his own election secure, put proximity over principle and rallied to the French side against the Americans. When our negotiator, Carla Hills, refused to sell out America's interests to the Euro-protectionists, the free-trade talks fell apart.
This break coincided, not by coincidence, with the ouster of the foremost holdout against a political-economic Festung Europa, "Fortress Europe" -- Britain's Margaret Thatcher. The Iron Lady's fierce stand against a common European currency, with her country's economic fate to be determined by German bankers, led to the resignation of her Finance Minister and the revolt of the Conservative "wets."
Why did this Thatcher-Tory rape delight Mr. Kohl and Mr. Mitterrand? Because "Europe" is Germany and France -- "Kohlerrand" -- followed by nine other guys, and by the English-speaking islands across the Channel that form a bridge to the United States. To the extent this Franco-German alliance needs a bridge across the Atlantic, Britain is that bridge.
The new Prime Minister of the U.K., John Major, 47, presents himself as Thatcherism with a human face. At the latest Kohlerrand conference in Rome, the new P.M. acted like Mr. Bush espousing Reaganism -- mostly hanging tough in a kinder, gentler way. Mr. Major proposed a voluntary common European currency first, essentially living together before marriage, which Kohlerrand will consider.
But on the new man's way out, France's European supercrat, Jacques Delors, hit him in the back of the neck with a brick, warning "If we need to provoke a political crisis, we will do so." The arrogance was galling: any of this British sovereignty stuff, and we'll get you thrown out as we did Thatcher.
This week, Prime Minister Major will travel to Washington to meet President Bush. He will gain deservedly admiring headlines by being the firm ally in the Persian Gulf (even British Labor, mindful of the political disaster that followed its soppiness on the Falklands, has turned hawkish). But out of sound-bite range, the engaging Briton will do his bridge duty for Der Entente, persuading the Americans to save GATT by offering help to subsidized French farmers.
Mr. Bush is expected to accommodate him, to undercut the hard-line Mrs. Hills, and to dispatch a Cabinet deal-cutter to "save GATT" before a March 1 deadline brings on the dreaded U.S. Congressional oversight. The American President is too preoccupied with his eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with Saddam Hussein and his mouth-to-mouth resuscitation of Mikhail Gorbachev at a Moscow summit to entertain a trade war at this time.
But we have been brought to that brink by the Kohlerrand regional isolationism. The cement that has held Europe together for the past generation has been fear of an expansionist Soviet Union; the cement binding it now is envy of a prosperous America and Japan.
Not every war is hell; we need not respond to Europe's shortsighted economic regionhood by wringing our hands and predicting dire consequences in a world given over to the tariff-mongering Helmut Smoot and Francois Hawley.
Instead, realistic Americans should counterbalance Europe's penchant for protection by promoting free trade and food production within the Western Hemisphere, and by offering the incipient third grouping, the Asians, the choice of open intercourse or risky retaliation.
Europe's threatened goodbye to GATT need not mean a farewell to free trade. We can make it mean that the new world marketing order will find an efficient competitor in what used to be called the New World.

HEADLINE: War in the Gulf: Counsel of Ignorance

BYLINE: By Arthur Schlesinger Jr.; Arthur Schlesinger Jr. is professor in the humanities at the City University of New York.

 BODY:
Many factors shape foreign policy -- interest, information, judgment, vision, prejudice, fatigue, fear, panic, stupidity -- but there is one we tend to forget. That factor is ignorance -- ignorance of the challenge, of the context, of how ignorant we may be.
Take the Persian Gulf crisis. Do we really know enough about the Mideast to act with confidence? The U.S. has not had serious historic experience in this region. A few missionaries went there in the 19th century, a few oilmen in the 20th and that is about it. We have no strong tradition of Arabist studies in our universities. Most of the time we don't know what we are doing in the Mideast. 
 Recall our policy toward Saddam Hussein: support when he committed "naked aggression" against Iran; unconcern when he gassed Iranians, massacred Kurds and murdered his own opposition; agricultural credits amounting to a billion dollars; opposition to economic sanctions against Iraq until the very eve of more "naked aggression," against Kuwait.
One year, Saddam Hussein is our pal; the next, he is Hitler. One year, Hafez al-Assad of Syria is the king of terrorists; the next, he is our pal: we will repent that, too. When we got so much wrong about the Mideast yesterday, the day before yesterday and the day before that, why do we suppose we have suddenly got it right today? Right enough to send thousands of Americans to their deaths?
Years after the Vietnam War, I asked a high official of the Johnson Administration why they had ever supposed, as they said at the time, that North Vietnam was the spearhead of planned Chinese expansion into South Asia. Historians, I noted, could have told them that the Chinese and Vietnamese had hated each other for a thousand years.
My friend replied: When it came to Soviet questions, policymakers could turn to Government experts like Charles Bohlen, George Kennan and Llewellyn Thompson for informed counsel. In the case of China, John Foster Dulles had purged the State Department of the old China hands in the 50's. Our Far Eastern policy in the 60's thus plunged blindly ahead without benefit of expertise on China. So we got things wrong.
Alas, no Middle Eastern Bohlens and Kennans advise the Government at high levels today. In consequence, we are used, exploited and manipulated by wily locals in flowing robes who live in air-conditioned hotels and expect us to do their fighting for them.
If our ignorance of today's Middle East is considerable, our ignorance of the future there is total. Yet the case for war is increasingly based on the conviction that we have divine foreknowledge and know the shape of things to come. Those who claim the gift of prophecy say that unless we destroy Iraq's nuclear program, 5, 10 or 15 years from now Saddam Hussein, armed with the bomb, will terrorize the world. We have heard such prophecies before. It is the old -- I thought discredited -- argument for preventive war.
It requires particular presumption in 1990 to claim accurate foreknowledge of the future. Over the last four years, the world -- from the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe to South Africa to China to the Middle East -- has undergone extraordinary changes. What is equally extraordinary is that no one foresaw them: All the statesmen, sages, experts, all those bearded chaps on "Nightline" were caught unaware.
Some Americans were once so sure they could foretell the future that they called for preventive war against the Soviet Union and China. Does anyone regret that our Government declined to drop the bomb? And if great powers like the Soviet Union and China did not rate preventive war, why should we contemplate it against a third-rate power like Iraq?
Let us not sacrifice lives today because of a guess about what Iraq may be up to 10 or 15 years from now. Don't forget the warning of the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr about "the depth of evil to which individuals and communities may sink . . . when they try to play the role of God to history." Ignorance of the present, ignorance of the future -- these are pardonable. No statesman, no nation, can expect to know everything. But ignorance of how ignorant we are is unpardonable.

HEADLINE: We Needn't Beggar the Old to Aid the Young

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Again, Age Beats Youth" (Op-Ed, Dec. 2), Richard Lamm uses the wrong comparisons and then gets his facts wrong.
He lambastes Congress for spending more on the elderly than the young. But a proper comparison of public expenditures shows that (in 1986) combined Federal, state and local outlays totaled $278.9 billion for the young, but $263.4 billion for the elderly. The Federal Government spends more on income maintenance and medical care, focusing on the elderly (through Social Security and Medicare), while the states and localities (with substantial Federal aid) spend more on income maintenance for the young, through the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, and on education. 
 Mr. Lamm incorrectly asserts that "the elderly have the highest disposable income and the lowest rates of poverty of any group in America." The first allegation comes from a flawed study that defined "disposable income" as amounts above 30 percent of the average for "similar families." The same study showed families 65 and older to have the second lowest median income ($13,324), while other fully adult groups had income between $25,085 (25-34) and $33,223 (45-54). Only the group with family heads 15-24 years old had lower income, as one would expect of people in school or beginning work.
The study declared that the elderly had the largest pool of "disposable income" because more of the elderly had 30 percent above $13,324 than other age groups had above their higher average income. It counted all 17.7 million people in the 65-plus group and compared that with 10-year groups (25-34, etc.), consisting of 6.1 million to 9.1 million people.
A person or couple 65 or older must be poorer than younger comparable family units to count as poor under Census standards. In 1987, to be counted as poor, an individual younger than 65 could have income of no more than $5,909; but for a person 65 or older, the figure was $5,447. For a couple younger than 65, no more than $7,641, but for those 65 and older, no more than $6,872.
In "Drawing the Line" (1990), Patricia Ruggles, a Congressional economist, argues that these different standards are unjustifiable. If the same thresholds were used for everyone, she observes, the poverty rate for the elderly would be almost 3 points higher, and 1 1/2 points above that for the nonelderly. Without Social Security, about half of the elderly would fall below their poverty line; with it only about 13 percent do.
Mr. Lamm demands we curtail Medicare for those who can afford health insurance. But Congress enacted Medicare because private insurers could not provide the elderly an affordable product; the needs-tested Medical Assistance for the Aged program (1960 to 1965) did not do the job. And those with higher earnings pay more in payroll taxes for the same hospital insurance package than those with lower earnings. Also, a serious illness often ends or curtails work income, dropping Medicare recipients down the income scale.
Yes, as Mr. Lamm asserts, millionaires could afford to pay their own way without Medicare or Social Security. However, this group is so small statistically that it makes no sense to dismantle a successful system and throw millions of the elderly into financial and emotional distress to eliminate the rich.
Mr. Lamm is correct that we shortchange the health and education of the young. But he proceeds from false premises to his conclusion that "we have to spend more money on the next generation and less money on the last one." Beating up on the elderly, as Richard Lamm and Peter G. Peterson habitually do, is an unjustifiable and fruitless diversion.
We should enlarge our human investments in food, housing, education and health care for the young. We need not beggar the elderly to do so.

HEADLINE: How to Put Iraq Out of the Oil Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You are correct in "How to Choke Iraq" (editorial, Dec. 7): economic sanctions are working, to the embarrassment of the Bush Administration. Iraq will pull its troops out of Kuwait, but the sanctions are not the reason. They require time, which the Administration does not want to spend, since it has turned an erroneous defensive strategy and rationale into an erroneous and inappropriate offensive one. 
 The Administration now claims the sanctions will still permit Iraq to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. If the Iraqi threat to the Persian Gulf is to be permanently reduced, put Iraq out of the oil business. This is the only message Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d need carry to Baghdad.
Iraq's Saddam Hussein lacks revenues for an indeterminate period, and the goods halt while his social and military infrastructure disintegrates. He has had zero oil sales and revenue since Aug. 3. Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and others have seized his embargoed oil market share. Production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is higher than Aug. 1.
Iraq has to do what it did in 1985: give huge price discounts and exceed any quota OPEC assigns it, to win back lost market share.
To put Iraq out of the oil business, OPEC need merely price its entire oil production at $15 a barrel or half any price Iraq asks. Potential buyers will lack incentive to restore Iraq's market share. This should be done for at least three years, preferably until 2001; it will destroy Iraq's ability to develop nuclear, biological and chemical weapons immediately and eliminate its ability to use those it has.
Washington should tell those whom American lives are defending: Implement this strategy, or we pull our troops and ships out beginning Feb. 2. If those in the gulf will not effectively and nonmilitarily eliminate a threat to their future, why should Americans die to impose an inefficient means?

HEADLINE: Broken Contracts

BYLINE: By Irving R. Kaufman; Irving R. Kaufman is judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where he was Chief Judge.

 BODY:
Mass dismissals of young associates at important New York City law firms are reported almost daily in the news media. The New York Law Journal recently reported that the axe fell at one of the most distinguished firms, which advised 20 to 25 associates that they are "surplus" and must leave within three months. Other news accounts speak of decisions to discharge partners.
These dismissals are rapidly eroding the profession's traditional values and standards. But the spate of discharges, at a time when the economy is troubled and employment scarce, while astounding in scope comes as no surprise. 
 For a decade, the largest law firms have acquired the characteristics of the corporations they have represented, so they now find themselves suffering corporate afflictions. Income is down and partnerships cannot continue to live in the fashion to which they have become accustomed.
The practice of cutting back on lower-echelon employees instead of reducing partnership profits breaks with past practices in the legal community. At one time, law firms took care of their own, standing behind their partners and associates through hard times. Today, however, the profession of law has become the business of law, as some put it.
Although lawyers have long acted as experts called in for particular aspects of corporate work, they once largely remained on the periphery of the matters they negotiated. But with the dramatic increase in high-priced deal-making, firms could not resist the opportunity to share in the enormous profits they helped generate.
No longer outsiders to deals they facilitated, law firms essentially became extensions of investment banks, and corporate lawyers became members of investment teams. Some lawyers abandoned their accustomed role as underwriters of fair dealing and merged their financial interests with those of their clients. The tremendous number of hours billed accounted for much of the increase in revenues.
The National Law Journal said in 1988 that in the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout law firms reportedly earned upward of $60 million in legal fees. It said the $25 billion transaction, which took two months to complete, involved the services of about 200 lawyers from at least 10 firms.
As corporate deals abounded in the 80's, each requiring significant legal supervision, firms hired associates in record numbers. Targeting students at top law schools, firms spent untold sums courting summer and permanent associates.
Many leading legal lights reportedly receive more than a million dollars a year for their individual share of the profits. A survey in The American Lawyer's July-August issue estimated that partners at the six top-grossing firms earned from $1.015 million to $1.765 million in their most recent fiscal years.
Not long ago, these and other prestigious firms practiced a different kind of law. Their services included drafting contracts, preparing wills, supervising a wide range of problems and settling disputes. The training of associates was a more prominent item on the firms' agendas, as well. Young lawyers were carefully introduced to the profession's traditional methods and values, and partners, committed to younger members of the firm, invested a great deal of time and energy as mentors. The expectation of a long, fruitful relationship was taken for granted.
Perhaps some trimming of staff is unavoidable, but dismissals should be a last resort. Firms may be truly unable to afford the young lawyers they hired when profits from premium billings flooded their coffers. But alternatives exist: Partners could agree to compensate for shrinking profits by receiving smaller distributions, reducing administrative costs and offering associates salary cuts rather than pink slips.
While the practice of law has gone through many changes over the years, it has always held itself above the economic fray, insulated from the vagaries of the marketplace. At a time when the nation is beset by fiscal uncertainty, the legal profession should be the first to admit that perhaps it has been living beyond its means. It must set its house in order, but in a just way.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS AND THE GULF;
Hard Question May Need an Answer Soon: Should It Give Bush a Go-Ahead on Force?

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
After months of ducking a serious debate on American policy in the Persian Gulf, Congress is preparing to face its moment of truth.
 Unless a diplomatic breakthrough persuades President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to withdraw his troops from Kuwait before Jan. 15, lawmakers expect that they will have to decide whether to give President Bush the go-ahead to remove them by force. 
 Mr. Bush has offered no guarantee that he will seek such approval, saying only that he is "considering" it. And the Democrats who control Congress have shown no interest in pressing the point with resolutions specifically ruling out force. Instead, Democratic leaders have made plans for the new Congress that convenes on Jan. 3 to remain on call instead of recessing until Jan. 23 as originally scheduled.
"The Senate should and will debate this issue," the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, told reporters as he and seven Democratic colleagues left Washington on Thursday for a weeklong trip to the gulf that they described as an information-gathering mission. It includes visits with American troops in Saudi Arabia and meetings with Saudi, Egyptian and Israeli leaders.
But much as Congress wants to play a part in shaping Persian Gulf policy, the fact is that by tradition and inclination it is a reactive institution, especially in foreign affairs.
Its role in the current crisis is defined by sometimes contradictory objectives -- exercising the war-making powers conferred on it by the Constitution, raising legitimate questions about the conduct of foreign policy, supporting the President when American lives and vital interests are at stake and getting the President to make the first move.
 
The Vietnam Experience
 Representative Dante B. Fascell, the Florida Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, describes the Congressional posture as "staying as quiet as you can while gnashing your teeth and growling."
The first objective, shared by Republicans and Democrats, hawks and doves, is a genuine desire to see the constitutional prerogative to declare war protected and observed. The Vietnam experience weighs heavily on lawmakers, even though only 23 current House members and 5 current Senators were in office when the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was adopted in 1964.
Institutionally and emotionally, Congress has never quite forgiven itself for giving President Johnson what amounted to a blank check to conduct that war. Lawmakers who were prepared to wink at the Constitution when American forces were called to action in Libya, Grenada and Panama without prior Congressional approval see the gulf as a very different matter.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's assertion on Dec. 3 that the President has all the authority he needs right now to order offensive military action is taken very seriously on Capitol Hill.
"There is no question that the President, as Commander in Chief, can order the forces to engage in offensive action, and they will properly obey his command," the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, acknowledged in an interview on the CNN program "One on One."
"But to do that from a standing start," Mr. Foley said, "in my judgment, in constitutional terms, requires an authorization -- not necessarily a formal declaration of war, but an authorization."
 
More Than a Legal Nicety
 House Democrats were sufficiently exercised by Mr. Cheney's comment to adopt overwhelmingly a policy statement stipulating that the President should not order American troops into offensive combat without the explicit approval of Congress. Although Republicans have been less vocal on the subject, influential figures like Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, and Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, have told the President that it would be folly to proceed with a military offensive unless Congress is behind him.
The worry over consititutional requirements is more than a legal nicety. House and Senate leaders and the rank and file recognize that once American troops are engaged in combat, Congress will have little stomach to exercise its other constitutional prerogative: cutting off money to fight a war. That means that if a resolution authorizing force is adopted, any reservations, limitations or redefinitions of policy goals that lawmakers want to express on Persian Gulf policy will have to be built into it.
Those mechanics will be tricky if Congress is to meet another of its objectives: making sure that it is seen as supporting, or at least not obstructing, the President in the first major foreign policy crisis of the post-cold-war world. For Democrats this is also a matter of partisan political concern. Party leaders would like to dispel the image that Democrats are unwilling to use American military might under any circumstance.
That explains why Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Foley went along with President Bush's decision to order additional American troops to the gulf last month.
 
Support for Bush's Goals
 Party politics were also a major factor in the move by moderate and conservative House Democrats to modify the language in the House Democratic policy statment. At their behest, and with the full backing of the House leadership, the statement was amended to include a reiteration of support for the President's goals in the gulf and the initial deployment of troops to defend Saudi Arabia against an Iraqi attack.
"I've believed all along that there is something here worth standing up for and even dying for," said the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. Like other top Democrats in the House and Senate, Mr. Gephardt has argued that economic sanctions against Iraq should be given more time to work before miltiary action is taken. But that view, he said, has never been advanced to preclude the use of force, but rather to insure that it is a last resort.
In the last week, the Democratic Party's sensitivity to its image on questions of war and peace was underscored by the appearance of several prominent liberals in a new bipartisan coalition advocating the use of force to dismantle President Hussein's chemical and biological arsenal and potential nuclear weapons.
Congressional leaders are struggling with yet another difficult objective: making sure that once Congress speaks, it does so with something approaching coherence and unity.
 
Special Session Ruled Out
 This month, Mr. Foley, Mr. Mitchell and the House Republican leadership judged that convening a special session of the lame-duck Congress to debate gulf policy would be the worst way to accomplish that.
Although Mr. Bush was persuaded, there were dissenting voices from both political parties. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said the Bush Administration should have faced the question of authorization for use of force back in September, but he also blamed Congress for not pressing the point. "I think it was our responsibility," he said. "If they didn't, we should have."
Nonetheless, Congressional leaders fear that Congress does not deal well with hypothetical questions. Their fourth objective is to have the President ask Congress for something specific.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Help Exists For Dealing With Job Cuts

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
WITH the bad news of rising unemployment, bankruptcies of companies like Continental Airlines, more corporate downsizings and efforts by companies like Citicorp to cut costs by reducing staffs, good news is hard to pinpoint. But it exists: there will be a holiday hot line offering advice for the unemployed, a hopeful statement that almost everyone who persists can find a job eventually, and a book of suggestions for those with jobs, temporarily without jobs and those in retirement.
Manpower Inc., the big Milwaukee-based supplier of temporary help, recently predicted that hiring plans of American companies "will suffer a sharp decline in the first quarter of the new year." 
 Based on its quarterly survey of 15,000 employers, Manpower said there would be a net hiring drop of 1 percent; 16 percent of the companies will hire fewer people and 15 percent plan to increase hiring. The figures indicate "recession depths" of hiring everywhere except in the Midwest with the bad news most evident in the Northeast, Mitchell S. Fromstein, Manpower's president, said.
Many financial service companies have cut traditional year-end bonuses, and other companies are not paying bonuses or have been considering a revamping of salary levels. Some have begun so-called gain-sharing plans to provide financial flexibility. Workers receive a relatively low base salary, with profit-sharing based on changes in productivity or profitability.
More and more management consulting and law firms are holding seminars to advise management on how best to dismiss people without being sued and how to modify pensions, health or salary levels. For example, the New York law firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler held one last week for human resource managers titled "Reductions in Force, Executive Terminations and Early Retirements."
On the other side, outplacement firms help the dismissed employees, but outplacement firms receive their fees from companies doing the dismissing. Basic outplacement advice to the discharged employee is not to be bitter and not to sue but to concentrate on an immediate job search. Outplacement firms provide counseling, telephone answering, resume writing, job data banks, and other aids.
One piece of good news: Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., an outplacement firm with headquarters in Chicago, said that for the fifth year it would offer free job-hunting advice by telephone to anyone calling (312) 332-5790, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M, Chicago time, on Dec. 26 and Dec. 27.
"We will provide the call-in service for two days instead of one because of higher unemployment," James E. Challenger, the firm's president, said last week. Thirteen counselors will handle the calls. The firm expects more than twice the 1,100 calls it received last year.
Always an optimist, he says that most middle managers and others can find jobs in an average of 3.3 months if they conduct serious searches, not much changed from the typical 3.2-month search in recent years. "They might have to work for smaller companies," he added, "but jobs are out there."
George E. L. Barbee, executive director, personal financial services, at Price Waterhouse, the big accounting firm, stressed the need for middle managers and clerical workers, both young and old, to begin retirement and job-loss planning early in their careers. "Immediately," he suggested. He agrees with other experts that jobs will be less secure in the future, and few workers will spend 30 and 40 years with one company.
Employees should not count on severance pay, like the typical two weeks for each year worked, he said, or on weekly unemployment compensation, which varies from state to state, to take care of them.
Mr. Barbee's operation provides corporations with advice on how to encourage workers to prepare for their future when company benefits are being cut. Savings methods include payroll deductions for savings, stock purchase plans, 401(k) plans that permit workers to set aside taxfree money for retirement and Individual Retirement Accounts.
His organization has issued a paperback book titled "Retirement Planning Adviser, 1990-1991 edition," published by Pocket Books. It emphasizes some facts that make the case for hefty savings:
*Retirees will live an average of 20 years or so.
*Inflation eats big chunks of retirement money, at least 5.4 percent in 1990.
*Employees will change jobs or careers five or more times during a working life, which means less chance to accumulate pension money.
*Rising health-care costs mean "a person should watch health more carefully and set aside a reserve."
*Housing values have stopped growing and "retirees can no longer count on homes as a ready source of cash when they need it."

Bracing for the Year Ahead: Tighter Belts, Playing It Safe

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
"A CURTAIN of gloom has descended" on Madison Avenue, Edward Meyer, the chairman and president of Grey Advertising, said recently, assessing the current state of the advertising business. "As the industry continues to slowly shrink, there are going to be a lot of unhappy people."
Like many agency executives, Mr. Meyer predicts that 1991 will be a tough year as the industry bottoms out. Agency forecasters, like McCann-Erickson's Robert Coen, recently predicted that advertising spending will increase by only 4.6 percent next year, the lowest rate of growth in nearly two decades. 
 Even executives at agencies that have had banner years in 1990 are pessimistic.
"The best strategy is to plan on zero growth," said John M. Connors Jr., the president and chief executive of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, a Boston-based agency that saw its billings grow by more than 15 percent this year, to $400 million.
Many industry executives do not expect a turnaround to begin until late next year or early in 1992, when advertising spending should increase because of the Olympic Games and the elections.
As a result, many agencies are cinching their belts more tightly than ever. "Advertisers have become extremely cautious," said Carl Spielvogel, the chairman and chief executive of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide. "They've gone from making yearly budget commitments to quarterly commitments, and that has made it rough on agencies."
Mr. Spielvogel said his agency was watching expenses more closely than ever, mandating cost-saving practices like limiting executives to tourist class for business flights.
Burt Manning, the chairman and chief executive of J. Walter Thompson, said he was also looking for ways to trim costs. Thompson recently laid off about 40 employees each in its London and Los Angeles offices, and Mr. Manning said there were likely to be more staff reductions.
In the last few months, there has been a wave of layoffs at agencies, leaving hundreds of jobless in the industry. Some excutives say the biggest cuts are yet to come, with many expecting the new year to begin with several thousand layoffs. Some executives forecast that at least 10 percent of those working in advertising, primarily at big New York agencies, will eventually lose their jobs.
In some ways, smaller agencies may be hit even harder. Although many will manage to struggle through the tough times ahead, many executives predict a rash of closings for small and even some mid-sized agencies.
"The boom during the last decade simply created too many small agencies," said Mr. Connors of Hill, Holliday, Connors. "A lot of these agencies are now living on borrowed time."
Many industry executives say small agencies in particular will be hurt as nervous clients switch from smaller, more creative agencies to bigger agencies that have track records for developing marketing strategies that sell products. That may prove to be a boon of sorts for some of Madison Avenue's more famous names. Mr. Manning of J. Walter Thompson said that more clients than ever were looking for new agencies. "When times get tough, advertisers gravitate to the most successful agencies," he said.
They also tend to play it safe, emphasizing a concrete selling strategy over creative flair. But some industry executives said the conservative approach could backfire. "Advertising usually becomes more mundane during a tough economic period," said Jay Chiat, the chairman and worldwide chief executive of Chiat/Day/ Mojo. "But just being competent is riskier than going out on a creative limb."

HEADLINE: Albania Discusses Abolishing One-Party System

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The Communist Government of Albania has begun discussions with members of a fledgling opposition party on allowing independent political organizations in what has been a one-party country for the last 46 years.
Among the issues is how soon the current election law can be overturned. Only last month, Parliament made Communist Party entities eligible to take part in elections but proscribed any others. Parliament also set national elections for Feb. 10. 
It is not clear whether the Government can decree the legitimacy of new parties or whether Parliament must change the law.
Leaders of the five-day-old Democratic Party said in interviews by telephone that they were also requesting that the election date be postponed until spring, so that they and other opposition groups would have time to organize themselves to go against the Communist candidates.
According to another caller from Tirana, a group of Albanians meeting secretly three weeks ago formed an Albanian ecological party. The caller said they intended to make their organization public this week in the capital. Thepostwar industrialization of Albania has created pockets of severe air pollution around factories erected by Soviet and Chinese concerns in places like Elbasan, Shkoder, Lesh and the capital itself.
The discussions between the Democratic Party leaders and Prime Minister Adil Carcani began on Sunday night after a week of political unrest that climaxed in outbreaks of violence in four cities from Wednesday to early Saturday. Mr. Carcani, who became head of Government in 1982 under Enver Hoxha, then the Communist leader, told them the country's political future depended on dialogue.Mr. Carcani, who is 68 years old, said the Government would publish a decree authorizing the creation of independent parties, but his spokesman later said any changes would have to be ratified by Parliament.
 
Party Claims 300 Members
 Most of the members of the Democratic Party who have appeared in public are relatively young men. A spokesman, Genc Polo, said the party had 300 founding members, virtually all of them in Tirana.
In the last official count in 1986, the Communist Party had 147,000 members in the country.
In the Sunday discussion, Mr. Carcani and the leaders of the new party went over the outbreaks of violence that had caused destruction in Elbasan, Shkoder, Kavaje and Durres.Chemal Ljama, Albania's new chief prosecutor, said 157 Albanians faced trial on charges that they had committed acts of violence in these cities.
Gramoz Pashko, an economist who is a founder of the new party, said he and another founder, Sali Berisha, had deplored the violence in their meeting with Mr. Carcani but urged that those charged be given fair trials. Following a practice new in Albania this year, the defendants will have their own lawyers.
In a separate interview, Neshat Tozaj, a popular Albanian novelist, said he felt that the Democratic Party should have a role in framing the revised election law, even though it is not represented in Parliament.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Gold Post Gains On New Fears of Gulf War

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened slightly against most leading foreign currencies yesterday, buoyed by heightened concern over the potential for war in the Persian Gulf.
Gold prices rose slightly in New York, up 80 cents an ounce, to $377.50, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $376.50 an ounce, up 75 cents. 
 Currency trading was sparse as participants wrapped up their positions for the end of the year in anticipation of the Christmas holiday.
But the traders said new war talk by President Bush supported the dollar, generally considered a safe investment in times of turmoil.
Since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, traders have focused on heightened war tensions there, often to the exclusion of economic factors that ordinarily might sway the market's direction.
In yesterday's comments, Mr. Bush demanded again that the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, completely withdraw his forces from Kuwait by Jan. 15, the deadline imposed by the United Nations.
There will be "no concession, no negotiation for one inch of territory," Mr. Bush said. "He has got to leave without condition."
Mr. Bush said he was still willing to meet with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, on the gulf crisis if mutually acceptable dates could be arranged for the meeting, as well as for a reciprocal meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Mr. Hussein in Baghdad.
"The dollar is definitely being propped up by the impression that maybe the situation in the Persian Gulf is deteriorating slightly," said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer at Barclays Bank.
The dollar strengthened slightly against the British pound, with sterling closing at $1.9305 an ounce in New York, down from late Friday's $1.9370. In London, the pound fell to $1.9290, from $1.9390 late Friday.
The dollar was also slightly stronger against the yen, closing at 133.10 yen in New York, from late Friday's 132.85. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 133.10 yen, up from 131.87 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 133.15 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Friday, included: 1.4870 German marks, up from 1.4825; 1.2745 Swiss francs, up from 1.2735; 5.0620 French francs, up from 5.0405; 1.1579 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1583, and 1,122.75 Italian lire, up from 1,119.75.

HEADLINE: In Time of Crisis, Help From Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
Doris B. prefers mopping floors, doing the laundry and operating a cash register to waiting in long lines at the welfare office. But despite her willingness to work a 40-hour week, she is one of thousands of New Yorkers who are having a hard time making ends meet.
For the last two years, she has been struggling to keep up with bills that keep growing and to keep a roof over her head. 
 Yesterday, her one-bedroom apartment in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn smelled of ammonia and soap from its daily mopping. She said that she cleans it every morning after she returns from working the graveyard shift at a group home for the retarded.
"I like to keep this place spotless," said the 50-year-old woman who spoke only on the condition of anonymity . "I've lived here since 1978, and I would die and go to hell before I lost this place."
 
Her Savings Ran Out
 But earlier this year, it looked as if she might have to give up the apartment. She had lost her job of 18 years when Ohrbach's flagship department store in Manhattan closed, and she had not been able to find another full-time position that paid $20,000 a year. Her savings ran out, and she could not pay the rent. When her landlord served her with an eviction notice at the end of 1989, she was desperately looking for help to pay part of her back rent.
Doris received little help from the welfare office. She became a part-time cook for $90 a week at the Salvation Army, but this was just enough to buy food and pay part of her phone and utility bills.
Through emergency relief from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, Doris was able to receive immediate assistance -- $336.15 for one month's rent -- in January. She then persuaded her landlord to wait a few more months until her lawyer had won enough back benefits from welfare to pay her debt.
The money that helped Doris keep her apartment came from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. For the last 79 years, the fund has been raising money for the sick and the needy of New York.
 
Washing, Dressing and Feeding
 The proceeds from this year's Neediest Cases appeal, which began last month, will go directly to seven charities, including the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. The New York Times pays the entire overhead cost for the campaign.
Money from the fund gives people a helping hand in times of dire need, but it is often only a brief respite in their struggle to pay the bills.
Doris now has a full-time job but she is making $8,000 less than she did at Ohrbach's. She does not complain about the strain of her new job at the group home. Instead, she said yesterday, she likes the hugs the clients give her, and she shrugged off the unpleasant tasks -- taking them to the bathroom and washing, dressing and feeding them.
But Doris said she was tired of having to work so hard for such limited results. Financially, she is barely keeping her head above water.
 
Always Behind in the Bills
 There are three bowling trophies in her living room, but she has not been able to play for more than a year.
More than a third of her $12,000 yearly salary must go to rent. She is still behind on her utility and phone bills from her years of unemployment. She owes money for a loan she received to go to a vocational school. She completed the six-month nurse's aide program and has applied at a half-dozen hospitals, but that has not led to a job. She has no health insurance and must pay for the medicine her unemployed husband needs for his arthritis.
"I'm behind all the time," she said. "I'm having a hard time now, but I'm the only one I can turn to."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Says Cultural Agency Will Be Spared in Reorganization

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Reacting to the first tremors created by his administration's plans for a major reorganization of New York City's government, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that the Department of Cultural Affairs would not be eliminated as part of an effort to trim administrative fat.
With the city facing huge budget cuts, officials said last week that they were examining the functions of all 60-odd city agencies. The reorganization could meld a number of smaller agencies into larger ones, eliminate some departments and consolidate the functions of others. 
 While the process holds the promise of savings, it is fraught with political peril: Every agency has its own constituency and can be expected to fight for survival.
As word spread last weekend that the major function of the Department of Cultural Affairs -- awarding grants to cultural groups -- could be shifted to another agency, alarms sounded in the arts community that such a move would send a negative signal about the importance of the arts in the city.
 
Arts, Not Alps
 Yesterday, at a breakfast forum for businesses sponsored by The New York Post, Mr. Dinkins said the Department of Cultural Affairs would be spared changes but that his administration was still committed to a reorganization. The measures would be among the first to help bridge a $1.3 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
"I think it is appropriate that we examine our structure to see whether or not we might think differently and in a more effective fashion by some consolidations and downsizing," Mr. Dinkins said. "If we have several administrations that could be condensed into one, we ought to consider it."
But the Mayor added, "When one looks at the budget of Cultural Affairs, I do not think it would be wise to fold that into the Mayor's office, as has been the suggestion of some.
"I am mindful, as one person put it, that people don't come to New York to ski and look at the Alps," Mr. Dinkins said. "Among the reasons they come to New York is the great cultural center that we have here -- museums and theater and on and on and on."
Tourism is worth between $7 billion and $10 billion a year to the city's economy, he said.
 
Arts Officials Relieved
 Linda Blumberg, an assistant commissioner of cultural affairs, said yesterday that the department was relieved by the Mayor's statements. Organizations like the Cultural Institution Group and the Theater Development Fund had noted that only about $2 million of the department's $90 million budget goes to administration.
"I am aware of the difficulties the Mayor faces in meeting budget gaps," she said. "He is also aware of the role that culture plays in the city."
Ray Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private government watchdog group, said the outcry over the Department of Cultural Affairs illustrates how extraordinarily sensitive the reorganization will be.
"This is going to be a real good test of how serious people are about political reform," he said. "Unless a lot of people get on the bandwagon, narrow political interests may carry the day.
"The simple fact of the matter is that the present structure of New York City government is no longer sustainable," Mr. Horton said. "Logically, rationally, you can see a lot of overlap. You can even see some agencies that don't do anything of high social utility, but you have people who don't want to be out of work."
 
Union Concerns
 Stanley Hill, president of the 140,000-member District 37 of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, said yesterday that he was awaiting a meeting with city officials to express his concern about possible layoffs resulting from the reorganization.
Complaining that the union had been left in the dark on the issue, Mr. Hill said: "It's a bad way to run a government. It has an impact on our contract; it has an impact on workers."
In all, the future of about 15 smaller city agencies, like the Board of Standards and Appeals and the Department of Records and Information Services, is being scrutinized. More broadly, city officials say they are looking at administrative functions like grant applications, press operations, legal and accounting services and intergovernmental affairs to determine the amount of overlap between agencies.

HEADLINE: Stocks Ease in Slow Trading; Dow Off 0.49

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices weakened yesterday in the slowest day in almost a month, with 1,054 issues ending lower, although the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue chips fell only 0.49 point, to 2,593.32.
Activity slid to 118.6 million shares, the quietest since Nov. 23, the day after Thanksgiving Day, when trading dropped to 63.4 million shares. On Friday, volume totaled 150.9 million shares. 
 Heavy buying in the final half hour helped lift the Dow from a slump that had pushed it down nearly 19 points early in the day.
Analysts blamed the market drop on uncertainty over both the Middle East and interest rates.
Crude oil prices, the continuing barometer of the Gulf crisis, rose 50 cents, to end at $27.05 a barrel.
"The market's marking time," said David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist and strategist of Jesup, Josephthal & Company, "until we see what policy initiatives come from the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting" today.
He noted that there has been some speculation that the Fed might cut the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges banks for loans. He argued that even if the Fed did not cut the discount rate, it might cut the Federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans.
Also weighing on the market, he said, was the uncertainty created by the impasse between the United States and Iraq on a meeting date to discuss the Gulf crisis.
Kenneth Spence, director of technical analysis for Salomon Brothers, noted that "the broad market was a lot weaker than the blue chips, and the ratio of downside to upside volume was two-to-one on the downside."
"It suggests that the broad market was under selling pressure throughout the session," he said, "while the blue chips rallied at the close."
 
The Triple Witching Hour
 He said that with the triple witching hour coming Friday, when stock options, index options and index futures expire simultaneously, the rally seemed to have come from buying programs.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks such activity, said two selling programs much earlier in the day lopped fewer than four points off the Dow, while the sole buy program, lifting the market barely 3 points, came at noon.
Mr. Spence said he did not see much institutional buying and thought that if the rally did not originate with program buying, it might have come from asset allocators, advisers or institutions that move money quickly from one market to another on the basis of their view of market valuations.
He said he thought the market would be "choppy" for the rest of the year and "finish the year higher -- somewhere near 2,685."
Chrysler topped the Big Board's most active list, rising 5/8, to 12 7/8 in heavy trading after news that Kirk Kerkorian, the West Coast investor who sold MGM/UA last month for $1.3 billion, now owns 9.8 percent of the auto producer.
Bank stocks fell broadly amid continued market nervousness, with Citibank off 3/8, to 13 3/8; First Interstate 1 1/8, to 24 1/8; Manufacturers Hanover 1 1/4, to 19; Comerica 1 1/4, to 41 1/2, and Crestar 1 3/4, to 14 1/2.

HEADLINE: USE FORCE IN GULF, 14 EX-AIDES URGE

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Fourteen former senior Government officials, most of whom worked on national security affairs, urged today that the Administration use military force shortly after the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations for the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
The form of their message was a letter to Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, that was made public today with the intent of countering recent testimony by two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe and Gen. David Jones. In comments before a Congressional committee the two men and others pressed the Administration to postpone military action against Iraq and give economic sanctions a year or more to work. 
 The former officials who signed the letter to the Iraqi Foreign Minister included two former White House national security advisers, Richard V. Allen and Robert C. McFarlane, and a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Thomas H. Moorer.
 
View Directed to Baghdad
 The view in which they concurred was directed to Mr. Aziz to make clear to Baghdad that several former American policy makers favored a quick, decisive military strike if Iraq did not leave Kuwait by the deadline.
Robert F. Ellsworth, who was a Deputy Defense Secretary in the Ford Administration, said in an interview that he had organized the letter-signing effort in the last week to balance "the effects of some testimony over the last couple of weeks to let sanctions carry the full burden."
In their letter, the officials urged Mr. Aziz "to advise President Saddam Hussein that such misguided views should not stand in the way of the use of all necessary means to enforce the U.N. Security Council's resolutions."
Mr. Ellsworth, a former Republican Representative from Kansas and United States Ambassador to NATO, said: "Letting sanctions carry the whole burden is very, very damaging to the President's effort to get Saddam out of Kuwait without a war. It sends the wrong signals that he can just sit there and not worry about a credible threat of military attack."
Delaying military action indefinitely after Jan. 15 would erode the credibility of the United States-led coalition against Iraq and wear thin the patience of the American people, the officials said in interviews.
 
Growing National Debate
 They added their voices to the national debate that began growing on Nov. 8 when President Bush announced a wave of reinforcements that would swell the size of American forces in the Persian Gulf to 400,000 by late January.
Some experts, like former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, warn that there is no guarantee that sanctions will succeed. Others, including former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger and former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, argue that sanctions should be given a chance to work before waging a costly war.
Administration officials like Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the Director of Central Intelligence, William H. Webster, have testified that sanctions are working but carry no assurance that they will force Iraq to withdraw.
In addition to Mr. McFarlane and Mr. Allen, who served as national security advisers to President Reagan, and Admiral Moorer and Mr. Ellsworth, the letter was signed by former Air Force Secretary Thomas C. Reed, former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman and a former commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. P. X. Kelly.
The officials also included Vice Adm. John J. Shanahan, former commander of the Navy's Second Fleet; Brig. Gen. James D. Hittle, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy; Brig. Gen. Hugh S. Aitken, a former Marine officer; Robert H. Knight, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Robert D. Blackwill, former special assistant to President Bush for national security; Roland A. Paul, former counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and William J. Taylor, former director for national security studies at the United States Military Academy.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C.'S CHAIRMAN SUGGESTS NEW FEES TO INSURE DEPOSITS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The day after he predicted that 1990 and 1991 would be the worst years ever for the program that protects deposits at failed banks, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told Congress today that one way to strengthen the ailing insurance fund would be a $25 billion assessment on the industry and an 18 percent increase in the contributions banks make to the program.
Although Mr. Seidman stopped short of endorsing such a plan outright, he offered no other alternatives in an appearance before a House banking subcommittee, saying only that a proposal to reorganize the fund would be presented next month. 
 He outlined a plan calling for a one-time assessment of $1 for every $100 in deposits insured by the fund early next year and an increase within the next two years on bank premiums to 23 cents for every $100 in deposits insured. Premiums are scheduled to rise next month to 19.5 cents for every $100 in deposits, from 12 cents.
 
More Failures Feared
 Although the industry earned only about 60 cents per $100 of deposits in the first nine months of this year, Mr. Seidman predicted that the assessment "would add only marginally to bank failures andfailure-resolution costs." Economists, however, told the subcommittee that it could be quite damaging and might lead to more failures, and hence to losses to the fund of $3 billion to $8 billion.
How such an assessment would actually affect banks' financial statements is uncertain, because the Government has not yet decided how banks would account for it. The Treasury and banking regulators are considering whether to let banks count some of the assessment on their books as capital by giving them stock in the insurance fund or to let them recognize the cost of the assessment over a long period of time.
Because the plan does not directly involve taxpayer money, lawmakers are likely to regard it favorably. But the burden would probably be borne by banks' depositors and customers. who could be expected to earn less interest on deposits and pay higher fees and interest charges for borrowing as banks pass along their higher costs.
To make the assessment more palatable to the industry, Mr. Seidman held out a political carrot: a promise that he and the Bush Administration would offer support for rolling back Federal laws written during the Great Depression that limit commercial banks' ability to trade and underwrite corporate securities and to conduct business across interstate lines.
Mr. Seidman also said that regulators were preparing a policy to restrict the ability of troubled banks to declare dividends as a way of limiting bank failures and losses for the fund.
 
Payments Based on Health
 Another likely aspect of the overhaul of the bank insurance fund would be to charge banks premiums based on their financial health. On Tuesday, the board of the F.D.I.C. is expected to consider asking Congress to grant it the authority to change the premiums from the current flat-fee structure.
Mr. Seidman conceded that the plan he had outlined, which would raise $44 billion through the end of 1993, still might not be enough to protect the insurance program if a deep recession struck.
"There are scenarios under which the fund could become insolvent," he said.
On Sunday, Mr. Seidman said that 1990 and 1991 would see a drain of at least $9 billion from the insurance fund caused by collapsing institutions, leaving it with about $4 billion by the end of next year, much of which might not be readily available in cash.
He foresaw about 180 bank failures in 1991 involving assets of $70 billion. Those estimates are based on information provided by bank examiners and represent the worst institutions among about 1,000 troubled banks, he said.
 
Big and Small Banks
 Regulators calculated what those bank failures would mean for the fund based largely on historical patterns at comparable banks, Roger Watson, director of research and statistics at the F.D.I.C., said. Generally, smaller institutions cost the Government about 25 percent of their asset base to rescue, while larger banks, which have value in their franchises beyond their asset bases, cost 10 percent to 17 percent.
Most of the failures would probably be smaller institutions, Mr. Watson said.
The F.D.I.C. has estimated that reimbursing depositors of the 180 banks expected to fail would cost the fund $10 billion, and that it would receive premiums of $5 billion at the same time, creating a loss for 1991 of $5 billion.
The fund would be left with a balance of $4 billion, but because not all those assets are immediately marketable and because it is required to keep some in reserve, the fund would actually have considerably less than $4 billion in cash.
In addition, Mr. Seidman said the fund was facing possible additional liabilities of $6 billion to $7 billion because it had agreed to buy back certain assets from failed banks that their acquirers may not want to hold. These contingent liabilities have not been reflected on the fund's current balance sheet.
 
Congressional Study
 Much of Mr. Seidman's testimony was in response to a study commissioned by the banking subcommittee and produced by three economists who formerly worked for the Government: James R. Barth of Auburn University; R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., a California consultant, and Robert E. Litan of the Brookings Institution.
The three economists predicted that "by conservative estimates," the bank insurance fund would face costs of $31 billion to $43 billion from collapsed banks through 1993. At the upper limit, the study found that the costs of bailing out the banking industry in a severe recession could be $63 billion.
During the same period, the economists estimated, new money added to the fund would be $28 billion to $31 billion if the premiums did not rise above 23 cents for each $100 in deposits.
The economists did not have access to the examination reports used by the F.D.I.C. Instead, they looked at publicly filed information about the banks. They compared the historic relationship between capital levels at banks and their failure rates over the last three years and extrapolated from that information a probability of failure that they then applied to the industry.
Mr. Brumbaugh said that many banks "would not be able to survive" a 1 percent assessment. He said he opposed the assessment and instead favored a financing of the fund through a borrowing of the Treasury Department of up to $50 billion.
Mr. Litan, who favors either a Treasury borrowing or a one-time assessment, estimated that the assessment could generate $3 billion to $8 billion in additional losses to the fund by forcing more marginal institutions into insolvency.

HEADLINE: Regan Sees New Shortfall In the Budget

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Just three days after New York State lawmakers grudgingly approved $1 billion worth of budget cuts, the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, said today that the state was facing a new budget shortfall of up to $500 million.
The prediction publicly confirmed what many officials in Albany were saying privately last week: Despite the budget cuts, the state is likely to run short of cash by the end of the fiscal year on March 31. 
 Based on tax collections through November, Mr. Regan estimated today that state revenues for the year would be $200 million to $500 million less than state lawmakers assumed last week when they approved the largest package of mid-year spending cuts in New York's history.
 
Three Revenue Sources Decline
 Continuing their steady decline, the state's three major sources of revenue -- sales, corporate and income taxes -- all fell short of projections in November, even though the projections had been revised at the beginning of the month to reflect the onset of a recession.
"The prospect that the economy is going to revive to alter this erosion is very dim," said a spokesman for the Comptroller, Marvin G. Nailor. "We're saying that if things continue the way they're going, we're going to be short another $200 million to $500 million."
Mr. Regan also said today that the state was confronting a budget gap for the coming fiscal year of $4 billion, or $1 billion more than he predicted two months ago. This gap represents the difference between the amount the state expects to collect from existing taxes and the amount it expects to spend to maintain existing programs.
"The continuing erosion of the three major taxes and anticipated further decline in revenues would cause me to believe that my October estimate of a $2 billion to $3 billion shortfall is now closer to a range of $3 billion to $4 billion," Mr. Regan said. A $4 billion shortfall represents 8 percent of the state's $49 billion budget.
In Albany, where a new budget gap seems to be announced with every change of season, the news from the Comptroller's office was treated as no more surprising than the weekend's snowstorm. Many officials, adopting an I-told-you-so stance, said they had expected the bad news all along.
 
Leaders Not Surprised
 "Last month I said that our own fiscal analysts believed that the deficit for this year would probably be more than $1 billion," said the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino. "I see nothing in the Comptroller's report that leads me to believe anything different."
Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, said, "We said all along that it could get worse."
Indeed, implicit in the budget-cutting plan proposed by the Governor last month and finally approved by the Legislature last week was the assumption that the state's financial condition would continue to erode as the year wore on. By the Governor's most recent estimate, the state's budget shortfall amounted to $900 million; the budget cuts, in contrast, amounted to $1 billion.
But even as they were congratulating themselves on facing up to the state's grim fiscal realities last week, many lawmakers acknowledged that the budget cuts they were imposing on programs ranging from education to road repairs would not be sufficient to avert a deficit. Rather than contemplate additional cuts, however, they made a concerted effort to recess for the holidays before the Comptroller could release his report.
 
Full Picture Awaited
 Despite Mr. Regan's projections, budget analysts in both the Governor's office and the State Legislature cautioned today that the full extent of the state's fiscal problems would not be known for at least six weeks.
Both December and January are important tax collection months, with the state expecting to collect almost one-quarter of its total revenues for the year, and until the receipts are in, officials can only speculate about the size of the deficit.
Cuomo adminstration officials said today that the Governor would wait for more financial data before taking steps to close the growing budget gap. They said Mr. Cuomo had already ordered his budget office to prepare plans for cuts, some of which he could impose administratively, while others would require legislative action.
One financial analyst was critical of this approach, saying the Governor should take action now to stave off a deficit.
 
Immediate Cuts Urged
 "This isn't the last time we're going to talk about deficits this year," said Cynthia Green, a senior analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group sponsored by businesses. "The Governor should adopt the highest number and make the necessary cuts immediately."
Even a shortfall of $200 million, at the low end of the Comptroller's projection, would present Mr. Cuomo with a vexing set of choices in a fiscal year like this one, when the state has already cut spending and announced plans to lay off 2,000 workers. A shortfall of $500 million could force the Governor to borrow money to make it through the end of the year, something he has done in each of the last two years but has pledged not to do again.

HEADLINE: In National Speech, Cuomo Says He Is a Budget-Cutter

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo used a major speech here today to position himself as a Washington outsider whose experience as a born-again budget-cutter contrasts with President Bush's stewardship of the ailing national economy.
In a speech at the National Press Club, Mr. Cuomo accused Mr. Bush of ignoring the country's economic downturn while being preoccupied with the Persian Gulf crisis. He urged a shift in national focus toward domestic policy, which would necessarily form the rationale for any Cuomo Presidential bid. 
 "There is a long-term national economic crisis as dangerous to this country as Saddam Hussein," he said. "But so far, there is little evidence that Washington is prepared to deal with it."
Although he asserted that Mr. Bush should change course on the economy, he provided few details about the alternate path he might favor.
 
A National Platform
 The address was Mr. Cuomo's first on national economic policy since he was re-elected to a third term on Nov. 6. Many political analysts say they believe that if Mr. Cuomo is to run for President, he must decide by this summer to build a credible organization.
Whenever asked, Mr. Cuomo maintaines that he has no plans to enter the 1992 race. He has sent no signals otherwise, at least when his actions are measured against those of four years ago, when he chose not to run.
But he came here knowing that a speech to the press club, which often provides a platform for candidates-in-waiting, would do little to muffle speculation about a potential Cuomo candidacy. And his speech, after disappointing re-election results -- he was expected to get more than 53 percent of the vote -- allowed him to reassert his position as a national Democratic spokesman.
Mr. Cuomo said that voters' anger at the polls last month represented cries of middle-class anguish about the recession. Average Americans, he said, have figured out that the promises of supply-side economics were false.
 
Importance of Deficit Cutting
 He called for new recognition in Washington that economic growth depends not only on creating wealth, but also on improving the quality of the country's work force, schools, housing and transportation.
He criticized the White House, Democratic leaders and Congress for not doing enough in this year's budget negotiations to reduce the deficit, and complained that the country's borrowing spree had done little to strengthen its long-term economic prospects.
"That's the part that gets me and most governors," he said. "Two hundred billion dollars a year in interest that doesn't put a single computer into the hands of a single student, fund a single hour of research or provide a single meal to one hungry person."
Mr. Cuomo conceded that there was little Washington could do to forestall a recession next year, but said deficit reduction will be the key to stimulating the economy.
 
States' Budget-Cutting Example
 On that subject, he suggested repeatedly that the recent experience of cuting budgets in New York and other states could provide an example.
Mr. Cuomo and the New York State Legislature last week closed a $1 billion budget gap largely through spending cuts. The cuts were made in a budget that included a record tax increase for the second year.
The State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, announced today that new revenue forecasts suggest the gap could grow by another $500 million by the end of the fiscal year, in March.
"Don't tell me it's hard," Mr. Cuomo said. "I know it is. But that's why you're there. It is not a lack of options. It is not a lack of ideas. It is simply unwillingness so far to make the hard decisions."

HEADLINE: Tax Exemptions of Nonprofit Hospitals Scrutinized

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Congressional investigators have found that many private nonprofit hospitals provide charity care worth less than the financial benefits they get from their tax-exempt status.
Federal and state tax officials have begun systematically auditing nonprofit hospitals, prodding them to provide more charity care in return for their tax exemptions. The Internal Revenue Service has formed teams of experts to examine nonprofit hospitals, in a program coordinated from the agency's headquarters in Washington. 
 In Congress, several lawmakers have introduced bills to establish strict standards for the amount of charity care that must be provided by nonprofit hospitals.
The Attorney General of Texas has just sued the 1,527-bed Methodist Hospital of Houston, one of the nation's biggest private nonprofit hospitals, charging that it did not provide enough charity care to justify its exemption from local property taxes.
In Erie, Pa., Hamot Medical Center recently lost its exemption from local property taxes, and a state judge said its parent corporation used the hospital as a "money tree" to generate profits for investment in real estate, including a marina near Lake Erie. In Utah, county officials are trying to tax at least eight nonprofit hospitals.
Federal law does not say exactly how much charity care tax-exempt hospitals must provide. They qualify for an exemption only if they are organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes. I.R.S. rulings say tax-exempt hospitals must be able to show that they are operated for the benefit of the community as a whole. And charity care is one aspect of such service to the community, the rulings say.
 
'One Way to Provide Benefit'
 "We are encouraging hospitals to provide greater benefit to the community," said Marcus S. Owens, a senior I.R.S. official responsible for tax-exempt organizations. "And charity care is one way to provide benefit to the community. We want to make sure these hospitals operate as they said they would when they got their exemptions."
Health-care economists and Federal officials say it is often hard to distinguish between tax-exempt nonprofit hospitals and investor-owned profit-seeking hospitals. In a fiercely competitive environment, many nonprofit institutions now engage in commercial activities, establish profit-seeking subsidiaries, form joint ventures with private physician groups and try to expand their share of the local health-care market.
Timothy J. Sullivan, a lawyer at the I.R.S., said Federal tax auditors wanted to know if nonprofit hospitals provide emergency room care to all "regardless of ability to pay," if they turn away uninsured patients and if they exclude "any segment of the community." He said the Government had received information that some nonprofit hospitals discriminate against Medicaid patients.
Public health and tax officials say there is a big need for charity care because more than 31 million Americans have no private or public health insurance.
James J. McGovern, assistant chief counsel of the I.R.S., said many people mistakenly assumed that the need for free inpatient care would wither away after Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965. But, he said, the need for charity care remains substantial and has been heightened by the cost-control efforts of Federal agencies and private insurers, which have given all hospitals strong incentives to economize in the last five years.
 
$4.5 Billion in Lost Revenue
 Nonprofit hospitals are big business. The 3,200 private nonprofit hospitals constitute less than 1 percent of all charitable organizations in the United States, but they account for 43 percent of all the revenues of such organizations ($115 billion of $268 billion) and 32 percent of the total assets ($135 billion of $423 billion), Mr. McGovern said.
The private nonprofit hospitals account for 56 percent of the nation's hospitals. Nonprofit hospitals, which are not barred from taking paying patients, can and do make profits, defined as a surplus of revenues over expenses. But the surplus is supposed to be reinvested to further the hospital's charitable purpose and cannot be distributed to shareholders or others who have "a personal and private interest" in the hospital. The I.R.S. has said the surplus may be used for "improving facilities, equipment, patient care and medical training, education and research."
About 720 hospitals in the nation, accounting for 13 percent of the total, are owned by investors. An additional 1,789 hospitals, or 31 percent, are public, operated by Federal, state or local government agencies; they are generally not operated for a profit.
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, estimated that the Federal Government loses $4.5 billion a year in revenue as a result of the tax exemption for nonprofit hospitals. State and local governments together lose perhaps $3.5 billion.
Until this year, the I.R.S. rarely investigated nonprofit hospitals. But Steven D. Kohlert, senior vice president of Intermountain Health Care, said a team of I.R.S. agents had conducted "a top-to-bottom audit" of his company over the last nine months, reviewing books and records, examining scores of physician contracts, visiting emergency rooms and measuring the volume of indigent care. Intermountain is a Salt Lake City holding company with 24 nonprofit hospitals in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming.
A recent study by the General Accounting Office found there was "little difference in overall rates of uncompensated care" provided by nonprofit hospitals and by those that seek to make a profit. Forty-three percent of private nonprofit hospitals in New York, and 71 percent in California, provided charity care worth less than they would have paid in Federal and state taxes if they were not exempt, it said.
"For many nonprofit hospitals, the link between tax-exempt status and charitable activities for the poor or underserved is weak," said Mark V. Nadel, who supervised the accounting office study. "If Congress wishes to encourage nonprofit hospitals to provide charity care and other community services, it should consider revising the criteria for tax exemption."
 
Push in Congress
 Representative Edward R. Roybal, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging, has introduced legislation to establish stringent criteria for the tax-exempt status of private nonprofit hospitals, including numerical standards for charity care.
Representative Brian Donnelly, Democrat of Massachusetts, has introduced a bill that would require nonprofit hospitals to provide certain amounts of charity care as a condition of being allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds, a major source of financing for nonprofit hospitals.
Profit-seeking hospitals look enviously at their tax-exempt rivals. James D. Baker, executive director of the Biloxi Regional Medical Center, a 153-bed privately owned for-profit hospital in Mississippi, said: "Some private nonprofit hospitals are making unbelievable amounts of money, not paying any taxes and not using the money for research, education or charity care. They have an unfair advantage."
Hospitals compete aggressively for patients, and the I.R.S. says some offer cash bonuses, loans and other financial incentives to attract doctors who will admit patients to the hospital. But tax officials say such arrangements by private nonprofit hospitals may violate Federal law, which says that no part of the net earnings of a tax-exempt corporation may "inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual."
"Driven by their need for access to patients, hospitals are scrambling to attract and retain doctors, who control over 70 percent of health-care expenditures today," said Mr. Sullivan of the I.R.S.
 
Action in 12 States
 New guidelines for I.R.S. auditors tell them to "scrutinize any business arrangements under which hospitals finance the construction of medical buildings owned by staff doctors," because such arrangements may improperly siphon off charitable assets for the doctors' benefit.
Local officials have tried to revoke tax exemptions from nonprofit hospitals in at least 12 states.
Methodist Hospital of Houston disputes the charges made by the Texas Attorney General, Jim Mattox. "We are a nonprofit hospital, but not a charity hospital," said Larry L. Mathis, the hospital's president. "We do not set out specifically to extend our services to the poor. We were founded 71 years ago as a teaching and research center, and we believe those activities are charitable because they benefit everyone."
Mr. Mattox acknowledged that Methodist Hospital was providing some benefits to the community, but he insisted that it was not providing nearly enough charity care.
Bonnie S. Brier, general counsel of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the nation's oldest children's hospital, said the Government's scrutiny of nonprofit hospitals was overdue.
"The perception of abuse without enforcement is creating a political climate that may result in overreaction by Congress and state legislatures," she said in an interview. "It is in the interest of charities to have the law fairly and evenhandedly enforced, or else Congress and state legislatures will try to enact more severe measures that impede our ability to carry out good works."
Sister Bernice Coreil, chairwoman of the 302-bed Hotel Dieu Hospital in New Orleans, said Roman Catholic hospitals opposed the idea of a uniform national numerical standard for charity care. The need for such care varies from state to state, she said, depending on local economic conditions, Medicaid eligibility criteria and the generosity of Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals.
"We have a call to respond to the needs of the indigent," said Sister Bernice, a spokeswoman for the Catholic Health Association of the United States. "It has nothing to do with numbers or percentages. We are willing to carry part of the burden of caring for the uninsured, but it's really the obligation of society as a whole."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of U.S. Issues Rise Modestly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose modestly and interest rates slipped a bit yesterday, as dealers bought notes and bonds on the apparent expectation that policy makers will decide to ease monetary policy at a meeting in Washington today of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee.
"Participants are watching the Fed, and there is a possibility they might do something," one government bond trader said. "If they don't ease, then the market will give back some of the gains." 
 Analysts said the Fed's open market operations yesterday provided no clues as to its intentions on lowering the overnight Federal funds rate to 7 percent, from its current target of 7.25 percent.
 
New Reports Awaited
 Before a Government report on Friday showed that producer prices rose by an uncomfortable five-tenths of a percentage point in November, analysts were almost unanimous in their view that the Fed would move to lower rates at the meeting. Now, even though the economy is in a steep slide, private analysts said the Fed might delay its next move until after it has seen reports on how the economy fared this month. Those will not be available until early in January.
"It's only a matter of when they will ease, not if," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets. "And when they do, they will also have to consider what to do with the discount rate."
The discount rate, the rate the Fed charges banks for loans at its discount window, is currently at 7 percent, unchanged for almost two years. Although the Fed has said it is studying the possibility of allowing the Federal funds rate to fall below the discount rate, traditionally the discount rate is set below the funds rate.
Analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, said in a market commentary that "given the weakness in the economy, as strongly reflected in recent economic and money numbers, rising inflation is highly unlikely. The inflation hawks at the Fed have very little to support their case."
The analysts said they expected the Fed to signal an easing tomorrow.
Speculation about a possible Fed move was the focal point in an otherwise slow session. But traders said they were encouraged with the day's developments. "This was a good day," one bond trader said. "Prices fell for two straight days and were down again early today. But then it turned around. I think the correction everybody was looking for has taken place, and that we are heading for lower rates."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 106 13/32 late yesterday, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.17 percent, down from 8.18 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 3/8, up 6/32, to yield 7.99 percent. The 7 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 22/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.70 percent. And the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 5/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.28 percent.
 
Three-Month Rates Down
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 6.78 percent, down from an average rate of 6.86 percent at last week's sale.
Bids on six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 6.77 percent, up from the average rate of 6.74 percent a week ago.
Activity in the new-issue market for corporate debt slowed significantly yesterday, as only one new issue was priced. Indeed, investment bankers said that after an extremely hectic few weeks, the corporate appetite for floating new debt in 1990 had probably been satisfied. "That could be it for the year," one investment banker said.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues slipped by about 1/8 point.

HEADLINE: New York Giving Up 5-Year Drive to Build Middle-Income Units

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration has decided to shelve a proposal made nearly five years ago by some of New York City's leading developers to build 3,000 apartments for middle-income New Yorkers at no profit, the developers and city officials said yesterday.
The decision ends a prolonged saga for the ambitious and highly promoted program, one that included political and community opposition, financing difficulties, a drastically weakened real-estate market and, now, the city's fiscal woes. 
 The developers' plan was conceived as a demonstration of how inexpensive housing could be built privately if government barriers were removed. Instead, it has provided a graphic example of the long, arduous, sometimes tortured path between an idea and a building. It has demonstrated the kind of bureaucratic, political and legal obstacles inhibiting development.
The developers made their offer in March 1986 after the city said it would streamline the regulatory process and change some building regulations in a major effort to spur new housing construction for the middle class.
The first phase of the plan was to be a large condominium complex called Tibbett Gardens, to be built in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. It was originally to include 1,000 apartments. An average two-bedroom apartment was to sell for about $112,000, with the city providing a direct subsidy of as much as $25,000 an apartment and other incentives.
But the complex became mired in a host of problems, including strident opposition from the neighborhood. It was delayed for nearly two years by a lawsuit filed by some of its neighbors. And, once that was resolved, the developers confronted the sharp downturn in New York's real-estate market and a tightening credit market.
Tibbett Gardens finally expired because of the city's fiscal problems, which require huge cuts in the capital budget. The Dinkins administration told the developers last week that it had canceled the proposal, said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the trade group that represents the city's developers and real-estate brokers and was the plan's overall sponsor.
 
A Decisive Vote
 Felice Michetti, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, confirmed yesterday that Tibbett Gardens would not be included in the capital plan that Mayor David N. Dinkins is to make public on Friday. When the complex was approved by the city's Board of Estimate in November 1987, Mr. Dinkins, then Manhattan Borough President, cast one of the decisive votes in its favor.
Ms. Michetti said the current fiscal crisis, combined with the competing needs of other housing programs, spelled the end of Tibbett Gardens. "I think Tibbetts really reflects a long, complicated history," she said.
Mr. Spinola said he believed that the canceling of Tibbett Gardens also meant the end of all other components in the developers' plan, including a similar condominium project in Astoria, Queens, which would also require city subsidies.
"I guess I feel sad that so many people who tried to do something good failed because of circumstances that I think were beyond our control," Mr. Spinola said in an interview. He said no single factor had caused the project's demise, but that it had fallen victim to a host of causes.
Opponents of the Bronx complex were jubiliant yesterday when they were informed of its cancellation. Some objected to the site chosen; others objected to the use of city subsidies for middle-income, rather than low-income housing.
The Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, said the project was doomed because the city's subsidy -- originally estimated at $25,000 an apartment -- had grown to double that amount or higher. The developers disputed the higher estimates.
Mr. Ferrer contended that the site for Tibbett Gardens, eight acres at 230th Street and Tibbett Avenue, was inappropriate for a large housing complex because it is at a busy intersection and much of the site is landfill.
"It's a dopey housing site," he said. Mr. Ferrer said he would like for the city money to be used instead on other housing proposals for the Bronx.
The complex had faced strong opposition from people in Kingsbridge and neighboring Riverdale, who contended that it would tie up traffic, overburden local schools and pose environmental hazards. Mr. Spinola said he believed that some opponents were motivated by racial bias and that they feared black and Hispanic New Yorkers would buy apartments at Tibbett Gardens.
Mr. Ferrer said he, too, believed some of the local opposition was based on race. "I am not naive," he said. "Some of the most vocal opponents had in their hearts, I am certain, a motive that was racially biased. But I opposed it for the reasons I laid out, which had nothing to do with race and ethnicity."
 
'Completely Unjustifiable'
 In addition to the local opposition, Tibbett Gardens and the developers' overall plan were opposed by some citywide housing groups.
Bonnie Brower, executive director of the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development, a coalition of community groups, hailed the decision to shelve Tibbett Gardens. "It was a project that was completely unjustifiable, unnecessary and mistargeted, and its passing will not be mourned," Ms. Brower said.
But the program's proponents saw its passing as a lost opportunity.
"I think it's really bad for the city," said Paul A. Crotty, a city housing commissioner under Mayor Edward I. Koch who designed the city's ambitious 10-year housing program. "The people for whom this project was targeted are decent, hard-working people, people who need some help to stay here, and now they won't get that help."
Among the program's problems, several supporters said, was an inability to rally political support for it. The opponents were highly vocal, proponents said, while the middle-class people who would have benefited from the housing did not speak out for it. The city defines middle-income households as those with incomes between $32,000 and $53,000 a year.
"There was no constituency, other than the quiet people who wrote to us and said they needed an apartment," said Mr. Spinola of the Real Estate Board. Although the developers never solicited potential buyers for the Bronx condominiums, more than 1,000 people had written to inquire about them after reading news articles about the project, he said.
Politics was only one of the reasons the developers' effort foundered, Mr. Spinola said. The suit by local opponents tied up the project for almost two years. The developers prevailed in court, but during that time banks began to tighten up on loans and the city's real-estate market shifted significantly.
Some critics had argued for several years that the fate of Tibbett Gardens would hinge on an odd technicality: no developer was willing to take on the liability of paying off the loan for construction costs. "They were donating their time, their effort, but they were not going to make a profit from this and so they did not want to take a risk," Mr. Spinola said.
 
An Escrow Fund
 In 1988, he said, a bank might have granted the loan anyway. But in the current real-estate market, that became extremely difficult. For the project to proceed, the banks wanted the city to set aside $50,000 to $60,000 an apartment in an escrow fund to cover costs if it took years to sell all the apartments, Mr. Spinola said.
Critics argued that such a subsidy was much too high. But Mr. Spinola maintained that the real cost to the city would have been much lower, perhaps $35,000 an apartment in the worst case, because revenues from the initial apartment sales would have offset the cost of paying off the construction loan.
The Dinkins administration decided early this year that the escalating costs endangered the project. So Tibbett Gardens, which had already been reduced from 1,000 to 750 apartments to obtain the Board of Estimate's approval in 1987, was scaled down again.
This time, the plan was for only low-rise town houses, with a maximum of 400 apartments, not the mid- and high-rise structures envisioned originally.
But the city's budget crunch caused the end of this more modest version, the developers and city officials said.
"It's grim," Mr. Spinola said, "because it's tied to the downturn of the city's economy and the nation's economy. I think this would have happened otherwise."

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
From the way Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, talks about the New York Giants and their chances of making it to the Super Bowl, it is obvious that he is still attached to America, where he spent 11 years.
But not all of his thoughts of the United States are so pleasant these days. He is very much concerned about the pending deals by American Airlines to buy seven routes between the United States and London from ailing Trans World Airlines and by United Airlines to buy five others from teetering Pan American World Airways. 
 Five of the T.W.A. routes, including a Chicago route that American bought earlier but has yet to start flying, and all five Pan Am routes have operated out of Heathrow, the London airport preferred by most international passengers and the one where British Airways is king.
The other two T.W.A. routes go to London's Gatwick Airport, to which American already flies from Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth. American also flies between Chicago and two other British cities: Glasgow and Manchester.
The United States Government is putting pressure on the British Government to allow the Heathrow rights to be transferred from Pan Am and T.W.A. to United and American, and there could be months of thorny negotiations. [Page D6.]
If the British Government does allow the transfer -- and many analysts and industry executives, including Sir Colin, are betting it will -- British Airways will face the biggest challenge to its dominance of the Britain-United States market. British Airways holds 39 percent of the market, which is its most important business.
"United and American are going to be greater competitive threats than Pan Am and T.W.A.," said Daniel M. Kasper, an airline consultant at Boston-based Harbridge House.
British Airways is Western Europe's largest carrier and No. 7 in the world, based on the number of miles it flew passengers last year. In the year ended March 31, the routes to the Americas accounted for 252 million ($415.2 million), or 62.7 percent of British Airways' airline operating profits of 402 million. The routes represented 1.59 billion, or 33.8 percent, of the airline's revenues of 4.72 billion. Of its profits and revenues from the Americas, the vast majority came from the United States.
American, the largest United States carrier, is already in the midst of putting in place a plan to become a big trans-Atlantic carrier. It now serves 11 cities in seven European countries from the United States. Even before the T.W.A. pact, American had plans to add two more routes to its existing 18 in 1991.
United, the No. 2 carrier in the United States, is following a similar strategy. This year it began flying to Frankfurt from Chicago and Washington and to Paris from Chicago.
 
Sought Deal With United
 United's interest in the European market must be an especially bitter pill for Sir Colin and Lord King, chairman of British Airways, because they had been counting on an alliance with United to help expand British Airways' presence in the North Atlantic market.
British Airways flies to 19 cities in the United States. About the only big American city it does not serve is Denver. But Sir Colin and Lord King have been hoping that United would feed their airline lots of Europe-bound passengers from smaller American cities.
Although Sir Colin is not saying the marketing alliance with United is dead, he said, in reference to the United-Pan Am agreement, "It is incumbent upon us to review our options in the light of that deal, assuming that the deal finally occurs." United has said it will call off the Pan Am deal if it is forced to fly to Gatwick.
A treaty between the United States and Britain gives the rights to fly to Heathrow specifically to Pan Am and T.W.A. Under British law, the rights are not transferable: There is a long waiting list to get into Heathrow and newcomers have to fly to Gatwick, London's No. 2 airport, or Stansted, a new airport.
The American and British Governments are renegotiating the treaty. The Bush Administration, which is concerned about Pan Am's dire financial condition, wants Britain to allow the Heathrow rights to be transferred and the British Government is reviewing the law, though a decision is not expected before mid-January.
If the British Government makes the Heathrow rights transferable, Sir Colin wants Britain to demand concessions from Washington. First, he wants the 25 percent limit on foreign ownership of United States carriers to be raised significantly if not altogether eliminated -- something Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner is considering.
In addition, Sir Colin is seeking changes in Federal rules and industry practices that he contends discriminate against foreign carriers in computerized reservation systems that handle most passenger bookings in the United States.
 
Seeking U.S. Stake
 Clearly, British Airways has not lost its desire to buy a sizable stake in a big United States carrier. Last year, British Airways joined with United's management in an attempted buyout of the American carrier. British Airways was prepared to invest $750 million in return for 15 percent of United.
But the deal fell through when United's management could not get financing. United's stock price then plunged far below the offer price. And with United preoccupied until October with a series of unsuccessful takeover bids from its unions, British Airways deferred its ambitions.
But British Airways still has the money it raised for the original deal. It is one of the world's strongest airlines financially and could probably come up with $1 billion to $1.5 billion to buy a stake in a United States carrier.
Given the toll being taken on balance sheets throughout the airline industry by the high fuel prices caused by the Middle East crisis, several American carriers could undoubtedly use an injection of capital.
United would seem a less likely candidate given its decision to invade British Airways' turf. The marketing alliance between the two, which was signed in 1987, has also not been very productive, though Sir Colin blames United management's preoccupation with the attempted takeovers. "The actual business we have received has continued to be less than 2 percent of our North Atlantic traffic," or about 6,000 passengers a month, he said.
Stephen F. Wheatcroft, a London-based consultant and former British Airways executive, said one possible target is the USAir Group. British Airways already has a small tie with USAir: Passengers on its Britain-United States flights can acquire USAir frequent-flier points. British Airways is in United's and American's frequent-flier programs, too.
Delta Air Lines and British Airways coordinate their Britain-Dallas-Fort Worth flights. But Delta has much more extensive marketing agreements with Swissair and Singapore Airlines.
Greater ties with a United States carrier seem crucial now that United and American are poised to replace Pan Am and T.W.A. on the United States-London routes.
Pan Am and T.W.A.'s reputations for indifferent service forced them to resort to discounting to attract customers, analysts said. As a result, they have not posed much of a threat to British Airways, which has been making money by attracting business travelers who are willing to pay high fares for top service.
 
Tougher Rivals

American and United promise to be much tougher rivals. Not only do they have the domestic routes to feed passengers into their international system, they also have a reputation for superior service.
Sir Colin said he was not quaking at the prospect of a head-to-head battle for business travelers with United and American. "We're certainly not taking this frivolously," he said. "But if it does become a battle over who can provide the best service, that's fine by us."
After all, he noted, "we've already been worrying about all the others" -- including American, Delta, Northwest, USAir, Continental and Virgin -- that fly out of Gatwick.
His confidence -- and British Airways' profits -- underline how much the carrier has changed since the early 1980's, when it was still state-owned and passengers said B.A. stood for "bloody awful" service.
John King, an industrialist, was appointed in 1980 by the former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to transform the bloated, loss-ridden company into a profitable, competitive airline that investors would want to own.
In 1983, Lord King recruited Colin Marshall. A marketing specialist, Sir Colin had worked at Hertz, headed Avis and been a senior executive at Norton Simon, the American conglomerate that had bought Avis, before returning to Britain in 1981 to be the No. 2 at Sears P.L.C., the British retailer.
Under Sir Colin's leadership, British Airways has been systematically improving its service. He had made enough progress to enable the company to be sold to shareholders in February 1987. But he has not eased up and is considered to have helped to create a revolution in the airline industry by treating passenger categories as brands.
In the nearly three years since British Airway overhauled its business, or Club, class, the number of Club passengers has risen by about 27 percent. Since a new first-class service was introduced in March 1989, the number of passengers has risen by about 5 percent.
 
Improving Economy Fare
 Given that a first-class one-way ticket from Heathrow to Kennedy Airport in New York costs $3,024, a Club class costs $1,802 and the least expensive full-fare economy is $508, it is obvious why British Airways is one of the most profitable airlines in the world.
The next category to be improved and branded is economy. That will happen on a worldwide basis on Jan. 15, when the World Traveller and Euro Traveller classes will include more comfortable seating, improved catering and a new range of in-flight entertainment.
"We decided that it was very opportune to do it in this recessionary climate," when many business travelers and consumers are trading down, Sir Colin said.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
A PARTIAL PULLOUT BY IRAQ IS FEARED AS DEADLINE 'PLOY'

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told America's NATO allies today that he expected President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to take a dramatic step, like a partial withdrawal from Kuwait, just before a United Nations resolution authorizing force to evict Iraq goes into effect in mid-January.
Addressing foreign ministers at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's annual winter meeting, Mr. Baker urged his colleagues to stand united against any such "ploy."
"We should anticipate," Mr. Baker said in his remarks to the ministers, "that as we draw close to Resolution 678's Jan. 15 deadline, and as the choices are presented starkly, Saddam Hussein is likely to try to undercut the collective will of the international community to use force. Just as I believe he chose to release hostages for this purpose, I think he may take a dramatic step on or around Jan. 15. He could withdraw partially."
 
'We Need to Anticipate'
 Mr. Baker added: "We have all agreed that partial solutions or outcomes that are conditioned or linked to other issues are unacceptable. We need to anticipate Saddam's possible moves, be prepared for a partial withdrawal ploy and coordinate closely our responses." 
 The American assessment appeared to have met with widespread approval from the 15 other NATO ministers, who issued a statement on the Persian Gulf crisis at the end of their discussions today, declaring that "there can be no partial solutions."
Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis of Italy, which is currently serving as the rotating president of the European Community, said the community's foreign ministers would decide at a meeting on Tuesday whether to go ahead with a planned meeting in Rome this week with Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz.
 
Considerations Behind Meeting
 That visit had been scheduled when it was assumed that Mr. Aziz would be meeting with President Bush today in Washington and then go to Rome for talks with the community.
Iraq has asked the community to go ahead with the meeting. [Page A8.] But with the Iraqi-American dialogue now on hold in a dispute over dates for Mr. Baker's proposed meeting with President Hussein, Administration officials said it appeared unlikely that the community would agree to see the Iraqi minister now for fear that he would try to use the opportunity to drive a wedge between them and the Americans.
Mr. Baker's remarks were the first public expression of a concern shared by Administration officials ever since Nov. 29, when the Security Council approved Resolution 678, authorizing the use of force against Iraq after Jan. 15.
 
Worried About Partial Pullout
 Their worry is that on or about Jan. 15, President Hussein will announce a partial withdrawal from Kuwait in an effort to split the international coalition between those who would still insist on a total pullout and those who would accept a partial withdrawal as sufficient to avert war.
 
Move Considered Logical
 Administration officials said that they have no particular intelligence that the Iraqi leader planned such a partial withdrawal but that such a move would be logical for him to first try to see if a partial withdrawal might divide and weaken his opponents before considering a total pullout.
Reports from Kuwait that Iraq has fenced off the northern part of the country, or only integrated part of it into neighboring Basra province, have fueled speculation that Mr. Hussein might be planning to keep just the northern half of Kuwait. That would leave him in full control of the disputed Rumaila oilfield, most of which is already inside Iraqi territory, as well as Warba and Bubiyan islands, which control Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Baker apparently chose to raise this issue now -- even before there is an agreement between the United States and Iraq on the timing of talks between the two Governments -- because officials anticipate that in the talks, the Iraqis are likely to at least hint at such an alternative.
 
Concern Over Hussein's Stature
 Asked what would be so bad about a partial Iraqi pullout, a senior State Department official argued that if the Iraqi leader is in any way rewarded for his invasion of Kuwait, he will be seen in the Middle East has having won against both the United States and the United Nations. As a result, his stature would grow and he would be able to dominate the region politically the same way Egypt's President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, did after his political victory over Britain, France and Israel in the 1956 Suez crisis.
The Administration's concerns about an Iraqi offer of a partial pullout are also exacerbated by a sense of the fragility of the anti-Iraq alliance, as well as the fact that such an Iraqi offer would provide strong ammunition for domestic critics of the Administration's strategy of threatening Iraq with war. The critics would be able to argue that if four months of sanctions produced a partial Iraqi withdrawal, then maybe four more months could produce a total withdrawal and therefore military action should be delayed.
"Making clear that there will be no reward and no linkage to other issues is essential to convincing Saddam, one, that he cannot drive wedges between us and, two, that time is running out," Mr. Baker said in his speech at NATO's Brussels headquarters. "A peaceful outcome depends on his seeing that he has only two choices. Any meeting with the Iraqis should reinforce the starkness of the choices, lest any miscommunication lead them to miscalculate once again, thereby actually increasing the risk of war."
 
Issue of Meeting With Aziz
 On the issue of the meeting with Mr. Aziz, Mr. De Michelis said the community's initial objective in scheduling the session had been to "strengthen, not weaken the international cohesion" against Iraq. But the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said Britain opposed a European Community meeting with Mr. Aziz until after the Iraqi Foreign Minister met with the Americans. He added that Britain would not be alone in that position.
The NATO gulf statement also gave a general endorsement in principle to the American and community diplomatic contacts with Iraq.
"We are confident," the NATO statement said, "that a contact between the presidency of the European Community and the Foreign Minister of Iraq, among other initiatives, can make a contribution. We also encourage action by the U.N. Secretary General to this end. In particular, we support efforts for a dialogue, such as those made by President Bush, to provide Iraq through direct, high-level contacts with the clearest possible understanding of the consequences of further postponing of the fulfillment of its obligations."
In addition to calling on his colleagues for unity, Mr. Baker also put them on notice that he would soon be calling on them for more money.
 
Allies' Share of the Burden
 "When I last spoke to you on this subject, we had not yet augmented our forces in the gulf to provide a credible offensive capability," said Mr. Baker, referring to the Administration's decision on Nov. 8 to double American troop strength in the gulf. "That was a very big decision for us. It meant calling up reserves and dividing tens of thousands of families. It meant significant new economic burdens for us. And it means real risks and real sacrifices for the American people. It is in this context that we will be coming to you again to discuss how we might responsibly share these additional costs and risks."
Congress has become increasingly agitated over the fact that so many allies have pledged so little and those who have pledged more have not all delivered their payments.
The House majority leader, Richard Gephardt of Missouri, warned President Bush on Saturday that he must be more aggressive in securing financial backing from America's key allies if he wanted Congress to approve the $20 billion in supplemental funds that the Administration plans to seek in early 1991 to help pay for the gulf operation during the coming year.
Mr. Gephardt and a fellow Democrat, Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, estimated that the gulf operation would cost the United States $36.85 billion in the 1991 fiscal year. They said America's wealthy partners in the anti-Baghdad coalition -- Japan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Germany and Korea -- had up to now pledged $10.62 billion, or 29 percent, with Washington having to cover the other 71 percent of the operational costs.
 
Not One Inch, Bush Declares
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Bush said today that Iraq had until midnight on Jan. 15 to withdraw from Kuwait and vowed he would not negotiate for "one inch of territory" with President Hussein.
"None of us wants war, but none of us is prepared to accept a partial solution," Mr. Bush said after meeting in the White House with representatives of 28 countries that have sent troops or money to aid the Persian Gulf military operation.
Mr. Bush said he was still willing to meet with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, but only if Mr. Hussein agreed to receive Secretary of State Baker before Jan. 12, the date proposed by Iraq.
"I'm not going to shove these meetings right up against the United Nations deadline and thus have the adverse effect of undermining the total fulfillment of the resolutions," Mr. Bush said.
Referring to the United Nations resolution setting Jan. 15 as the date after which force may be used to end the Iraqi occupation, Mr. Bush said, "I think at midnight, if he's not totally out of Kuwait, the U.N. sanctions must be fulfilled."

HEADLINE: White House Retreats on Ruling That Curbs Minority Scholarships

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The White House chief of staff today ordered the Education Department to reverse its ruling on scholarships for minority students, acting on President Bush's instructions to retreat from the decision, Administration officials said.
The action today came within hours of Mr. Bush's selection of Lamar Alexander, the former two-term Governor of Tennessee, as the new Secretary of Education. He would replace Lauro F. Cavazos, who was forced to resign last week by the White House. The selection of Mr. Alexander, one of the first governors to champion education reform more than a decade ago, was seen as an effort to revive the department and make good Mr. Bush's pledge to be the "education President." [Man in the News, page B14.]
 
Debate at Meeting
 In a contentious meeting in his office this afternoon, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, John H. Sununu disagreed with officials from the White House, the Justice Department and the Education Department over how far the Administration should retreat from the ruling that scholarships designated solely for minority students were illegal. 
 Some officials suggested that the Education Department ruling should simply be suspended while a lengthy review was conducted. Others urged language that would let the ruling stand but add restrictions that, in the words of one official, "would take all the legal teeth and political problems out of it."
Instead, Mr. Sununu said the Administration should go further and reject the foundation of the ruling. Where the Education Department said private donations should be treated in the same way as public money, Mr. Sununu ordered Federal lawyers to come up with language that would draw a legal distinction between private and public scholarship money. Mr. Sununu argued that this could be presented as something less than an outright reversal, but officials who were unhappy with his decision said it would be seen that way.
Those officials argued that accepting any form of race-exclusive spending would undermine the principles on which the Bush Administration's civil rights policies rest: that there can be no discrimination of any kind, even if that would adversely affect minority groups.
As of this evening, an Administration official said Mr. Bush had not given his approval to Mr. Sununu's approach, but the chief of staff wanted to announce a decision on Tuesday in hopes of getting Mr. Bush out of this latest political bind on civil rights as quickly as possible.
Michael L. Williams, the head of the Education Department's civil rights division, who issued the original scholarship ruling without the knowledge of the White House, scheduled a news conference for Tuesday morning.
Mr. Williams decided that it was illegal for colleges and universities supported by Federal money to give scholarships that are designated solely for minority students.
Mr. Williams argued that even if the money came from private donations once it was in the possession of a university, it was, in effect, public money. Lawyers from the Education and Justice Departments, led by the White House counsel, C. Boyden Gray, agreed with that assessment.
 
Embarrassment to Bush
 Although the Administration has strongly opposed quotas or race-specific programs like the ones rejected by Mr. Williams, the ruling deeply embarrassed Mr. Bush, who learned of it only after it was reported in the press and disapproved of it. The announcement stunned the education establishment, infuriated civil rights groups and complicated Mr. Bush's already strained relationship with black voters.
Still smarting from criticism of his veto of civil rights legislation earlier this year, the President made it clear he wanted his staff to find a way to reverse the scholarship policy, while saving as much face as possible in the process, officials said.
Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, indicated Mr. Bush's position today when he said the President, who has long been a supporter of the United Negro College Fund and other efforts for minority students, was "very disturbed" by Mr. Williams's decision.
"He does believe that minority scholarships have been important for economic growth and development, for educational opportunity," Mr. Fitzwater said.
Some officials argued that the Administration could not simply reverse Mr. Williams's ruling without embarrassment and without appearing to reject Mr. Bush's stand against quotas. The President vetoed the civil rights bill largely because he believed it would lead to racial quotas in employment.
In discussions over the weekend and in Mr. Sununu's office today, one official said, some officials suggested that the White House could suspend the ruling and order a "thorough review."
"Of course, a review can go on forever, and meanwhile the old policy would be in place," the official said.
Another suggestion was that the ruling be "redefined" to say that it applied strictly to scholarships that were distributed according to an applicant's race but that scholarships intended to redress economic imbalances or past patterns of discrimination would be legal, he said.
"Bush's instincts were to be pro-minority access and supportive of Willams at the same time," a senior official said, noting that Mr. Bush telephoned Mr. Williams today to express his personal support for him.
"One way would be to issue a statement that would offer to give technical assistance to universities to make those scholarships need-based and diversity-based in a way that would make sure there was no reduction of minority access," the senior official said.
Mr. Sununu decided it was possible to draw a legal distinction between money that came from private sources and money from public sources, the official said, and ordered the lawyers to do so. The chief of staff argued that private money could be spent any way the donor saw fit, the official said.
"At one point, someone said, 'Well, what if person X gave money to a university and said it could be used only for white students?' " the official said. "The ruling was that that was O.K. because it would be private money."
The official said the latest draft of the Administration's new ruling on the issue stipulated that the law "would allow universities, including public universities, to administer scholarships where the donor restricts eligibility."
 
'Fairly Progressive Governor'
 This debate was the backdrop to Mr. Alexander's selection as Education Secretary. But the former Governor skirted questions about the issue today at a White House news conference.
A longtime associate of Mr. Alexander said: "I would rate Lamar as having been a fairly progressive Republican governor, and you can read between the lines on what he says about this question. But he's political enough to know that he's got to move the President's agenda in a way that's got some political sensitivity to it. And there is no way he's going to get himself staked out on a position until he knows the political landscape."
Mr. Alexander, now the president of the University of Tennessee, was considered as a Vice Presidential candidate in 1988. He was seen as a likely choice for Mr. Bush's Cabinet in 1989, but was passed over.
Many conservatives, including Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House minority whip who has been feuding with the White House, applauded the selection of Mr. Alexander.
Some conservatives were disappointed that their candidate for Education Secretary, Lynn Cheney, the head of the National Endowment for the Humanities, was not chosen.
"What's to be enthusiastic about?" asked Thomas S. Winter, editor of the weekly Human Events, a conservative magazine. "It's a boring choice. No imagination there."

HEADLINE: Colombian Peace Pact Offers Leniency to Drug Traffickers

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEDELLIN, Colombia, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Colombia's war on drugs, which gripped this cocaine trafficking center only six months ago, is winding down into peace talks between the new Government and the major traffickers.
If negotiations remain on track, the new year should see the surrender of up to 300 traffickers in return for lenient treatment, immunity from extradition and permission to retain all property, say Colombians close to the talks. 
 Emphasizing the drug dealers' human vulnerabilities, Diego Montana Cuellar, one of the negotiators, said of wealthy traffickers who want to abandon their clandestine methods and clear their names by serving light sentences, "They have big fortunes in Colombia," he remarked, "but their children have to study in Europe."
 
U.S. Experts Are Skeptical
 In return for reintegration into society, the traffickers are promising to give up exporting cocaine from Colombia, currently the world's largest source of the illegal drug.
But drug experts from the United States, the world's largest importer of cocaine, are skeptical that Colombia will win the war on cocaine through what one called "a series of concessions."
"The loss of extradition is a devastating blow," the expert said, adding that he believed the traffickers would resort to killings and bribery to intimidate Colombia's judicial system. "You can't believe that a drug trafficker who turns himself in will give up trafficking."
Advocating an aggressive approach to the cocaine cartels, American officials applauded raids on traffickers last year that brought the confiscation of 400 ranches, 470 planes and 600 vehicles. Most of the $89 million in American aid to Colombia this year was earmarked for police and military work against the traffickers.
But Colombians, weary of the toll and tension of the drug war, appear to give overwhelming support to the peace policy of Colombia's new President, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo.
In the presidential campaign that culminated in Mr. Gaviria's election in May, he drew a subtle but crucial difference between those he called "drug traffickers," often the salesmen of drugs on the street, and "drug terrorists," those who kill politicians who get in their way and pervert the political system. In doing so, Mr. Gaviria tapped into a weariness among Colombians over drug-relared violence.
Still, among the people in general, the desire for a negotiated solution has grown.
 
'We Need Peace'
 "It's time to stop pursuing a war that only interests the United States," said Humberto Samorano, a 23-year-old university student. "It's their problem if they can't educate their people to stop taking drugs. As long as there are consumers, there will be sellers."
Vicente Jimenez, a 27-year-old engineer, said, "I agree with Gaviria's policy of stretching out his hand to the drug traffickers, because we need peace."
To justify his policy, Mr. Gaviria, who took office in August, has said the drug war's annual cost to Colombia adds up to $2 billion -- half in military spending and half in economic losses.
With a traffickers' truce overlapping his first four months in office, Mr. Gaviria continues to enjoy approval ratings of about 75 percent in public opinion polls.
Mr. Gaviria is the political heir of Luis Carlos Galan, an anti-drug hard-liner who was assassinated at a campaign rally in August 1989 while running for president, and a former Cabinet minister and fellow Liberal Party member of ex-President Virgilio Barco.
The waning interest of Colombians in the drug war was reflected in an interview that Semana magazine, the country's leading newsweekly, conducted with President Gaviria recently. Only one of the 20 questions touched on narcotics.
In a sign of shifting attitudes, newspapers and magazines have started recently to air the pros and cons of decriminalizing drugs.
 
Unease in Foreign Embassies
 Backing for Mr. Gaviria's peace policy is harder to find in the embassies of cocaine-importing nations. In recent weeks the United States and the European Community have started to lower or abolish tariff duties on virtually all of Colombia's legal exports. The trade concessions are a reward for Colombia's efforts to curb its major illegal export, cocaine.
"There is a feeling among law enforcement people in Colombia that too many concessions are being made," an American narcotics official in Bogota said, choosing his words with care.
The concessions are expected to include an end to extraditions of drug-trafficking suspects to the United States for trial and the reassignment to the Colombian Embassy in Washington of a hard-driving police director whom traffickers have accused of human rights violations. Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo Angel has already declared that virtually all the properties seized in last year's antidrug raids will be returned by mid-January because they are not involved in trials.
[In Bogota on Monday, Justice Minister Giraldo announced that all traffickers who surrender and confess their crimes will have their sentences cut in half and will be protected from extradition for life.
["If Escobar surrenders and confesses all his crimes he would enjoy a reduction by half of Colombia's maximum sentence, which is 30 years, and would serve 15 years," the minister said, referring to Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medellin drug cartel.]
 
An Order to Shut Up
 Over the last week, six high-ranking Government officials declined repeated requests for interviews on the new drug policy. In the past, all six talked freely about the drug war.
"There is an order from the top to shut up on drugs," a newspaper editor in Bogota said of the official silence.
Here in Medellin, home to the nation's most violent cocaine ring, there is wide support for the Government's effort to defuse the drug war through negotiations. Residents hope the traffickers' truce will culminate in coming weeks with the surrender of up to 300 traffickers. To test the waters, three medium-level traffickers have already turned themselves in.
"The traffickers would be very stupid not to accept the offer," a local businessman said. "It represents very little of what they should really pay."
Explaining widespread support given Mr. Gaviria when he visited this month, the businessman said: "People don't want to return to the bombings. They want to go out at night."
 
Seizures of Cocaine Rise
 Across town, at the headquarters of the Fourth Army Brigade, the new commander, Gen. Pardo Ariza, talked more enthusiastically of pursuing guerrillas, the army's traditional mission, than of pursuing traffickers, a role acquired last year.
"The search for laboratories and drugs has at no time been suspended, " the general said. Indeed, so far this year Colombia's army and police have seized 55 tons of cocaine, compared with 41 tons last year.
The general's waiting room contained one of the last posters in town to offer $1 million for information leading to the capture of Colombia's most wanted man: Pablo Escobar.
One of the world's wealthiest men, Mr. Escobar is charged in Colombian courts with ordering the assassination of two former presidential candidates and the bombing of a police headquarters that killed 63 people and wounded 1,000. Still, 36 percent of those surveyed in a poll in October said Mr. Escobar should be granted amnesty.
Under the deal being worked out, traffickers would have to confess to only one crime, would not have to testify against other traffickers, and would have to promise to give up dealing drugs. They would be protected against extradition and would serve time in a special prison, protected from the general prison population.
 
Former Minister Is Critical
 "We are not submitting the criminals to the law, but the law to the criminals," said Carlos Lemos Simmonds, a former Justice Minister and one of the few members of the Liberal Party who dares to speak out against the violent drug rings. "They will end up running their businesses from jail cells."
To change minds in the party, or at least to win their silence, Mr. Escobar embarked in August on a carefully targeted kidnapping campaign. This month, to show good will, Mr. Escobar has released a few kidnapped journalists. He has also given up terror bombings in public places.
Both the Government and the traffickers now seem eager to reach a deal. Although antidrug police agents killed two of his cousins in shootouts in the last six months, Mr. Escobar has maintained his truce.
 
The 'Cloistered' Traffickers
 "The traffickers don't have freedom now," Juan Gomez Martinez, a newspaper publisher and former Mayor of Medellin, said in an interview here. "They are full of money, but they can't spend it. They live cloistered. They can't go out on the street."
Spurring the Government forward is a fear that if a deal is not reached in coming weeks, the traffickers will exert control over a constitutional convention that is scheduled for February.
Through communiques, the Justice Minister and the traffickers' front group, the Extraditables, are working to iron out such details as future lodging. The Justice Minister favors a new prison in Itagui, only five miles from here. The Extraditables say they would like a convent, protected by the army and open to regular monitoring by the New York-based human rights group Americas Watch.
"This whole thing is getting bizarre," said the American narcotics official in Bogota, barely able conceal his gloom. "Would the nuns be armed?"

HEADLINE: Economists Start To Fret Again About Population

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
JUST when you thought it was safe to procreate, the population bomb is back. Two decades ago, mainstream economists brushed aside the vision of a future chronically short of food and fuel. Now some are having second thoughts, prompted by new concerns about possible global warming and other strains imposed by population and economic growth on the planet's ecology.
Most economists remain confident that the conventional analysis of the population problem is substantially correct: a steady flow of new technology that uses resources ever more efficiently will offset any scarcity of minerals and arable land, at the very least dampening the tendency for commodity prices to rise. 
 But few ever bought into the more-the-merrier approach to population growth that became fashionable during the Reagan years. And a general unease with the academics' defense of laissez-faire population policies is now coalescing around new fears that the environment will not easily support a larger population at a decent living standard.
"Simply allowing every Chinese family to have a refrigerator and a television will swamp painful efforts in the West to limit global warming," argues Paul Portney, a researcher at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.
The gloom-and-doom school of population theory, founded two centuries ago by the Rev. Thomas Malthus, held that continuing population growth virtually guaranteed falling living standards as more mouths tried to feed off increasingly marginal land. Economists came to understand that Malthus had underestimated the capacity of technology to enhance productivity. But biologists and others were not so well persuaded.
The Malthusian dilemma reached a high-water mark of popular acceptance in the early 1970's. Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford University biologist who wrote "The Population Bomb," raised the prospect of mass starvation by the end of the century as too many people tried to subsist on too little land. "The Limits to Growth," a 1973 report from the Club of Rome, a group of business leaders and academics, forecast a more general hard landing as the world ran out of resources.
But neither history nor contemporary events confirmed the neo-Malthusians' predictions. Scarcity of resources has always been overcome in the past by the discovery of ways to wring more output from a declining resource base. Coal, for example, was substituted for charcoal in iron smelting when 19th century industrialists ran out of accessible forest. And as both the "green revolution" in agriculture and the broader decline in commodity prices in the 1970's suggested, technology was having no trouble staying ahead.
Even the exception -- the massive runup in energy prices after the Arab oil embargo in 1974 -- seemed to prove the technological optimists' rule. The energy shock stimulated a combination of new oil production and energy-saving investment that drove the real cost of fuel back to pre-crisis levels by the mid-1980's.
This is not to say that the critics of the unreconstructed Malthusian view were entirely sanguine about population growth. The dominant view of the relationship between population and economic welfare remained as simple as it is intuitive: more people meant less land and less capital per person, which in turn meant lower living standards than would otherwise be possible.
And David Bloom, a Columbia University economist, points out, population-driven poverty can be self-perpetuating. The more mouths to feed, the less families can set aside for savings; the more babies in need of education and medical care, the lower the proportion of savings available for productivity-enhancing investment.
But this drag-on-productivity model was forcefully challenged in the 1980's by Julian Simon, an economist at the University of Maryland. Drawing on the ideas of economists like Simon Kuznets and Esther Boserup, he noted that population growth could also stimulate productivity. More people, he speculated, would mean more heads to invent good ideas for improving technology -- how many Nobel Prize winners have been born in Andorra? And higher population density would allow scale efficiencies in production.
More intensive farming, for example, would make it economical to extend roads and rail to rural areas. And a large population of consumers would generate a natural internal market for mass produced industrial goods. "Does anyone seriously doubt," Mr. Simon asks, "that Europe is more prosperous with a population of hundreds of millions than it would be with a population of hundreds of thousands?"
 
Theory Wins Converts
 Mr. Simon's revisionism had no difficulty drawing converts. Many economists, notes Dan Dudek at the Environmental Defense Fund, were attracted by its libertarian implications: if population growth did not interfere with development, there would be no need to interfere with the procreative choices of consenting adults. And while it stopped short of endorsement, a prestigous panel of experts assembled in 1986 by the National Academy of Sciences gave population revisionism a respectful review.
Traditional conservatives also liked the idea. If population growth is not a social ill, governments need not spend money in support of family planning or abortion -- and there would certainly be no rationale for Chinese-style coercion. At the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City the Reagan Administration broke ranks with other affluent countries, abandoning Washington's long-held position that economic development would hardly be possible in the third world unless population growth was contained.
The revisionist message also meshed neatly with the cause of more open immigration policies: if more people would not retard prosperity in Africa or Asia, it certainly would not harm the American economy. Even the political left liked what it heard. Marxists have never had much truck with population worries; Friedrich Engels explicitly dismissed the Malthusian dilemma as an artifact of capitalism.
 
A Shift in Views
 The worm is now turning. David Bloom, writing with Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, found no statistical relationship between population growth and changes in output per person -- a conclusion that would not surprise Julian Simon. But Mr. Bloom believes that generalizations from past experience are dangerous.
He noted, for example, that Kenya managed to achieve a reasonable 2 percent annual improvement in living standards during the last quarter century even while it was experiencing the highest rate of population growth (4 percent) in sub-Saharan Africa. But that happy coincidence was probably only possible, Mr. Bloom argued, because the country had plenty of good land on which to extend agriculture. Future population growth, he suggested, will be far more problematic.
Kenya's predicament may apply elsewhere, and with a vengeance. In the last 20 years, Mr. Bloom points out, some 1.3 billion people have been added to the third world -- more than the entire population of the developed countries.
By the same token, Mr. Bloom rejects Julian Simon's broad-brush claims for economies of scale in poor countries. There may be circumstances in which high population density makes it easier to develop local markets for industry or to support an efficient transportation system. "But wouldn't Bangladesh be better off with five million fewer people," he asks? "The answer is certainly yes."
 Once population has raced past some reasonable level of density in poor countries, rapid population growth is surely a drag on living standards.
 
Need to Face Reality
 That is music to the ears of George Zeidenstein, the head of the Population Council in New York, who is frustrated that less than 1 percent of all development aid now goes to family planning. Even as American intellectuals backed away from population control, he notes, poor countries have been pushed toward it by the accumulating weight of health and education obligations. "They have been convinced," Mr. Zeidenstein said, "by their own realities."
 
Fears of Climate Change
 But the decisive tilt in the intellectual debate is coming from a newer source: fear of global ecological instability. Emissions of so-called "greenhouse effect" gases -- primarily carbon dioxide, methane and refrigeration chemicals -- are widely believed to be warming the earth's atmosphere. The higher temperatures that computer models project would raise ocean levels and flood low-lying areas. Weather patterns would also be likely to change, disrupting agriculture and creating new deserts.
Rapid population growth, notes Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at Michigan State, may bear little relation to the pace of global warming. Greenhouse emissions are more closely related to the level of economic activity than the numbers of emitters. The average American generates 19 times as much carbon dioxide as the average Indian. And it is entirely possible that, say, an economically vibrant Brazil with slow population growth would burn down its tropical forests more rapidly than an impoverished Brazil with rapid population growth.
 
A Daunting Problem
 The problem of preventing atmospheric warming without consigning a substantial fraction of the world to permanent poverty is daunting enough. It could be immensely complicated by excessive population growth. By United Nations estimates, the population of poor countries will rise by almost three billion in the next 30 years. Even if carbon dioxide emissions from third world economies can be held to the current per capita rate, an unlikely prospect if they are to become more prosperous, global emissions would rise by 30 percent.
Julian Simon is not perturbed by such arithmetic. People used to worry about running out of copper, he notes; now they worry about running out of atmospheric resources. It is already technically possible to beat the greenhouse effect with a mix of conservation and power generation from non-fossil fuels like solar and nuclear energy, he says. The real question, then, is how costly the fix will be. And if history is any indicator, he asserts, it will be far cheaper than now expected.
Many economists, however, are no longer prepared to put all their chips on the assumption that technology will again come to the rescue, offsetting the effects of projected doubling of world population in the next century. "In the absence of certainty," argues David Bloom, "the responsible position is to act conservatively." Hardly anyone is laughing at Malthus anymore.

HEADLINE: Uneasy Partners: Arts and Philip Morris

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
The Philip Morris Companies, the largest packaged-goods concern in the world, is facing a serious problem: How can it keep all the goodwill its highly praised support for the arts has created from going up in smoke?
This year, Philip Morris contributed about $15 million to arts organizations across the United States, making it one of the largest corporate givers to the arts in the country. Over the last 30 years, the company has handed out millions of dollars to the arts, with an emphasis on innovative work that many corporations would not go near. It is the largest corporate sponsor of dance in this country; indeed, without Philip Morris the whole landscape of dance in the United States would be substantially different, and enormously diminished. 
 But Philip Morris, which is also the world's largest cigarette company, has also been a major backer of Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, which is a major tobacco-producing state. It has contributed to his election campaigns and awarded a five-year, $200,000 grant to the Jesse Helms Citizenship Center in Monroe, N.C.
Senator Helms has been a leader in the attack against the National Endowment for the Arts, assailing it for supporting works of art he considers obscene, especially works by artists who he feels are promoting a homosexual life style. Many people have questioned whether a company that is a patron of the arts should also back a politician they view as a homophobic censor and potential destroyer of the arts.
 
Rejection and Boycott
 Their doubts have led to increasing demands that arts groups reject Philip Morris's money, as well as to boycotts of two of the company's prime products, Marlboro cigarettes and Miller beer, organized by Act-Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, and supported by gay-rights organizations across the country.
"It's a clear case of corporate America playing both ends against the middle," said William Waybourn, the director of public affairs for the Dallas Gay Alliance, which is active in the boycott. "What happens in some cases is that you get burned, and in this case Philip Morris got burned."
That Philip Morris plays both sides of the street is clear. It even gives money to arts groups that present performers whose work Senator Helms and other conservative politicians have found objectionable. What is more difficult to discern is whether its diverging policies arise out of self-protection or genuine commitment. The company itself seeks strongly to separate the issues, with the clear implication that the support for the arts is based on commitment and the backing for Senator Helms on self-protection.
"We hope that people would look to what we do in the arts as a measure of how we feel about the arts," said Stephanie T. French, the company's vice president for corporate contributions and cultural affairs. "What we do for Helms is something else."
 
The Importance of Helms
 "Senator Helms has been very supportive of our business interests," said George L. Knox, Philip Morris's vice president for public affairs. "He is a senator from a state in which we have a large number of facilities and many employees, with factories producing products for each of the industries in which we compete. It would be ill advised for a company like ours, which lives in a political arena, to turn our backs on him."
In addition, Mr. Knox noted, when you compare the amount of money given to the Senator with the millions given to the arts, there is no comparison. "The political action committee of Philip Morris employees has given Senator Helms, since its creation in 1978, some $19,000, or $1,500 a year over 12 years," he said, adding that Philip Morris has contributed money to many other politicians, both conservative and liberal, and that the Helms center does not support the Senator's political efforts.
Mr. Knox and Ms. French are quick to point out that their support of Senator Helms has not prevented them from giving money to groups like the Franklin Furnace, an experimental arts center in TriBeCa that is committed to presenting controversial work, or giving money to the Kitchen and Artists Space, both of which have been involved in disputes over art content.
"In fact," Mr. Knox said, "we've taken a lot of heat from the conservative right, the religious right in particular, on the basis of some grants of ours which may not have been made directly to the performer but which have been used for performances and works which are totally anathema to their interests."
 
Supporting the Endowment
 Their grants, they say -- and the recipients agree -- are given with no strings attached, with no restrictions of any kind on content. And at this year's Senate hearings on the future of the endowment, a Philip Morris spokeswoman, Karen Brosius, the company's manager of cultural affairs, gave a powerful speech calling for the endowment's continued life.
But despite the company's attempt to separate support for the arts from support for Senator Helms, they remain linked in many minds. Mr. Waybourn of the Dallas Gay Alliance said that arts groups should also boycott Philip Morris. "Why should the arts groups participate in something when the corporate sponsor is giving money to destroy what they are doing?" he asked.
The actor Ron Silver, the president of the Creative Coalition, an organization of arts professionals, also urged arts groups to sever their relationship with Philip Morris.
"People in the arts community say, 'Please don't go after Philip Morris, because we get a lot of money from them,' " Mr. Silver said, adding that he was speaking for himself and not for his organization. "But I feel there are enormous contradictions bordering on hypocrisy in accepting money from an organization that helps keep people like Jesse Helms afloat."
 
Backing Out of Bessies
 The dispute made headlines recently over the Bessie Awards ceremony in New York, an annual event that honors experimental performers, choreographers, designers and composers and of which Philip Morris has been a major sponsor. Citing Philip Morris's role, Karen Finley, a performance artist who was recently denied a grant from the National Endowment, resigned as co-host. The actress Danitra Vance, the other co-host, later resigned for the same reason.
But despite the controversy, leaders of major arts organizations that receive funds from Philip Morris said that they had nothing but praise for the company's arts program and saw no problem in accepting its money. Harvey Lichtenstein, the president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, whose Next Wave Festival has received major grants, put it this way: "I don't like the fact that Philip Morris supports Helms, but they have a perfect right to do so for their own business reasons, and I don't think there's a conflict between the two things."
And Charles V. Raymond, the interim executive director of the Joffrey Ballet, another major recipient, said he believed that "nothing Philip Morris did as far as supporting the Joffrey would ever lead me to believe that there was any requirement that the troupe support Jesse Helms or anybody else."
 
The Trouble With Cigarettes
 Controversy is nothing new to the Philip Morris arts program. One of the company's principal products is cigarettes, with many brands that include Marlboro, Benson & Hedges, Merit and Virginia Slims. Many people believe that cigarettes kill and for many years have said that accepting money from a company that sells them is morally wrong. Philip Morris has always rejected such criticism, noting that cigarettes are a legal product.
Philip Morris began supporting the arts in 1958, when it was a relatively small cigarette company and long before there was major controversy over cigarettes or the Senator. George Weissman, the chairman of Lincoln Center and former chairman of Philip Morris, recalled that the program was created to build "a positive image for the company and its employees by giving something back to the community that helped us become successful." But, he added, there was also something else: the focus on the experimental, on those artists who dare to take risks.
"I think that idea started back in 1965, when we did our first art exhibition, 'Pop and Op,' " Mr. Weissman said. "We wanted to demonstrate to our own employees that we were an open-minded company seeking creativity in all aspects of our business. And we were determined to do this by sponsoring things that made a difference, that were really dangerous."
 
Backing the Avant-Garde
 Many companies pride themselves on innovation and fresh thinking but are nonetheless highly suspicious of it in the arts. Philip Morris's commitment to the avant-garde and to the unusual, though, continues to this day, under the current chairman, Hamish Maxwell, as the company has grown to become the largest food company in the United States. Its Kraft General Foods division products include Jell-O, Tang, Kool-Aid, Maxwell House and Sanka. Its Miller Brewing Company is the second largest brewer in the world, with brands that include Miller, Miller Lite, Lowenbrau and Meister Brau.
The commitment seems a real one, not just one of convenience. The company is the major financial benefactor of the Next Wave Festival, to which it gave $350,000 this year. Its huge support of dance companies, large and small, includes $750,000 for a two-year sponsorship of American Ballet Theater, $250,000 to $300,000 a year for several years to the Joffrey Ballet, and major donations to the Alvin Ailey dance company and Dance Theater of Harlem. It also supports theater companies, art museums and touring art exhibitions.
Even the company's headquarters in Manhattan strongly reflects the commitment to the new. Office walls are decorated with paintings, sculptures or other artworks. Every piece is distinctly modern, and almost every one is distinctly avant-garde.
 
Museum Branch in the Lobby
 The building's lobby is home to the Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, a space donated to the museum in 1983 as one of the many grants the company has given the Whitney.
Philip Morris is of course very concerned about letting the public know about its contributions, so it can build that positive image. As a condition of many grants, the company's name appears in advertisements, programs, brochures and other literature put out by the arts organizations.
In exchange, though, Philip Morris often provides much more than money. "It follows up with publicity, advertising and entertaining," said Jane Hermann, the executive director of American Ballet Theater. "And in every city we play, they always buy 400 or 500 tickets.
Such support is especially appreciated by arts groups in these days of decreasing corporate contributions and in the atmosphere of uncertainty that exists over government backing. Mr. Knox says that Philip Morris will neither increase nor decrease its support because of the situation. "In terms of our giving, the only economy we are concerned about is the one in our building," he said. (Philip Morris's third-quarter profit this year was up 25 percent from the comparable 1989 period.)
He and Ms. French, though, admit to a continuing frustration. "This using of Philip Morris as a symbol for people's discontent is so simplistic and so unconstructive," Ms. French said. "People turn complicated issues into things that can fit on a bumper sticker. It's all they want to deal with, and it's very unfortunate."

HEADLINE: Weaning NASA From the Shuttle: Old Ideas Revived

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS space officials consider options for new rockets to take over some of the space shuttle's work, attention is turning to two ideas: one involving a new use of old technology and the other based on an innovative building-block approach to putting a variety of payloads into space.
The new booster rockets, which the space agency says it needs to lift up to 150,000 pounds into an orbit close to the Earth, could be used to ferry parts for the proposed space station, to help resupply it and to lift other heavy payloads. The shuttle, which can carry a maximum of 39,500 pounds into low orbit, would be reserved for tasks requiring people. 
 The large rocket was recommended last week by an expert panel headed by Norman R. Augustine, chairman of the Martin Marietta Corporation. Leading candidates for the booster are a cargo-only variation of the space shuttle called Shuttle-C and the Advanced Launch System, or ALS, a joint NASA-Air Force project envisioned as a system for assembling various-size rockets from modular components.
Almost three years ago, NASA proposed building Shuttle-C to serve as its so-called heavy-lift vehicle. The idea involved a cargo module, a wingless, crewless version of the shuttle, powered by the shuttle's liquid-fueled engines and clamped to the giant fuel tank and solid rocket boosters used by the shuttle. But Congress refused to appropriate funds.
The proposed ALS system, rockets built around clusters of a new kind of engine, was recently reduced to a low priority research program because of financing cutbacks by the Air Force.
"Everyone would like to have a heavy-lift vehicle, but the real challenge is to come up with the money for it," said Dr. William Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for space flight. "We didn't try hard enough and didn't make it as high a priority as we should have to get more money," Dr. Lenoir said at a briefing on Thursday.
Interest in alternatives to the shuttle heightened last week, when the 12-member Augustine panel, appointed by the White House and NASA to examine the future of the space program, concluded that "NASA should proceed immediately to phase some of the burden carried by the space shuttle to a new unmanned launch vehicle that offers increased payload capacity and is derivable wherever practicable from existing components. "
The committee said the civilian space program was overly dependent on the shuttle and would suffer greatly if another orbiter was lost, an event it said had a high probability in this decade.
NASA should not buy another space shuttle orbiter, the committee advised, after the shuttle Endeavour joins the current fleet of three next year. While the committee suggested that a big booster could be developed for the price of a fifth orbiter, estimated at about $2 billion, many space experts said the cost of a new rocket would be $5 billion to $10 billion.
Edward A. Gabris, the manager of NASA's heavy-lift vehicle office, said the agency could build a Shuttle-C and take it through its first test flight for about the cost of a new shuttle. However, initial flights of the system would be very expensive, costing about $500 million each, he said, because of additional development costs and the fact that the cargo bay engines would not be recovered, as they are with the shuttle.
 
Ready in 4 Years
 The Shuttle-C could be ready before any other big booster alternative and could serve as an interim solution until a more economical alternative is available, analysts said. Mr. Gabris said the Shuttle-C, which would have either two or three of the shuttle's liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen burning engines in the tail section of its cargo carrier, could fly within three to four years of a go-ahead.
The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment examined the Shuttle-C idea in 1988 and found that it would be cost effective only for selected missions, like servicing the space station, and only if flown no more than two or three times a year.
"There could be a handful of Shuttle-C flights for assembling the space station during the middle of the decade, but then there would be a gap of time when you didn't have much to do with it," said John Pike, director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, who termed it an interim step.
An alternative Shuttle-C proposal would forgo the 80,000-pound, side-slung cargo pod, instead mounting its payload in the conventional position atop the rocket.
A so-called in-line Shuttle-C, which would take several more years to develop, would put three or four of the shuttle engines at the base of the 154-foot external fuel tank. This configuration would use either the current twin solid-fuel boosters or a pair of the more powerful, advanced models now under development, said Jack Lee, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
The in-line Shuttle-C, which could lift heavier payloads than the side-mount version, could later use different rocket engines, like those developed for ALS, and become a more versatile vehicle by using a variety of upper-stage rockets, Mr. Lee said.
Jerry Grey, director of science and technology policy for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, an industry group, said Shuttle-C did not look like a good option because it was tied to old, expensive technology and because a rocket based on the shuttle would be launched from the elaborate sites designed for human flight.
Starting from scratch, as with a new booster like one derived from the ALS program, would not be as costly as some estimate, and the projected $10 billion cost could be paid for out of current budgets if NASA and the Air Force pooled their rocket requirements, Mr. Grey said.
<> <>
Congress has ordered NASA to trim $2.5 billion from the space station program and simplify its design, he noted. If the agency gave up plans for a fifth orbiter and pooled those savings with this money and money saved by reducing space shuttle flights to the space station, "this would be enough for NASA to kick in for its part of a new booster," Mr. Grey said. The Air Force, in turn, has allotted $1 billion a year for five years on a new booster and this could pay for its half, he said.
The Air Force, which has been using conventional rockets since the Challenger explosion in 1986, is investing in the ALS, a next-generation series of boosters that could become operational in the next century. But financing dropped from $150 million last year to $50 million in the current fiscal year, just enough to sustain key technology until full-scale development resumes.
The proposed ALS system is to be built using relatively inexpensive standard engines in rockets of varying lengths. The core vehicle would have three to four of the rocket engines, which would burn liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. These could be augmented with strap-on boosters using five to seven of the same engines; the boosters could be recovered . A core vehicle could be used alone to launch light payloads or a heavy-lift rocket could be built of several booster units containing dozens of engines.
Unlike the space shuttle's main engine, which operates under high pressure at 105 percent or more of its rated power, the ALS engine would be designed to operate at 65 percent to 85 percent of capacity. With a cluster of ALS engines, engineers said, if one failed, the mission would not be imperiled because the thrust of the others could be increased to compensate.
 
Lower Cost of Engine
 Shuttle engines, which generate 445,000 pounds of thrust, cost more than $35 million each, compared with the proposed ALS engine, projected to cost $4 million to $10 million each and generate 600,000 pounds of thrust.
Col. Roger T. Colgrove of the Air Force, the program manager for the project office in Los Angeles, said a goal of the new system is to reduce the cost of launching a payload into low orbit to $300 per pound, less than 10 percent of today's costs, by looking at new and cheaper materials and manufacturing techniques, more efficient and automated launching and recovery operations and easier-to-maintain components.
"Many existing rockets have been pushed about as far as they can go in terms of improvements," Colonel Colgrove said in a telephone interview. "Our ultimate goal is a modular family of launch vehicles that is not dead-ended."
Several analysts and policy makers say the Air Force and NASA have had a series of meetings in recent weeks, and are moving close to combining their rocket requirements into a uniform proposal, probably one that relies heavily on ALS technology.
"Congress has not been putting money into any rocket concepts because they are all different," Colonel Colgrove said. "I think we will soon see a change and see different requirements coming together."

Brooks Will Get the Job Done His Way

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Doesn't anybody here want to replace Darryl Strawberry?
Vince Coleman, whom the Mets paid $11.95 million, said last week he wasn't coming here to replace Strawberry. Yesterday, Hubie Brooks, who cost the Mets Bob Ojeda, said he won't replace Strawberry. 
 "That's definitely a no-no," Brooks said when the idea was raised. "I'm coming there to try to do a job. What Buddy needs me to do, what he tells me to do, I'll bust my butt to get it done. I think I can do what I've always done."
Brooks does not produce runs as abundantly as Strawberry, but he does drive in runs. Last season, with Los Angeles, he drove in 91 runs, only 4 behind Eddie Murray's team-leading 95. He was one of 14 National League hitters with 90 or more runs batted in. Yet, he quickly declined the role of Strawberry's replacement.
"That's not what the deal is," he said in a telephone conference call from Los Angeles. "I'm not replacing Darryl at all. Whether you come there to replace somebody or not, people have a tendency to think that. If you say you're not going to, you can get that monkey off your back before you start. People can say it, but you know in your mind you're not trying to duplicate what anybody has done."
The other point Brooks tried hard to make was that he was not upset at returning to the Mets, where he began his major league career in 1980. He was, however, not entirely convincing. He did, on the other hand, readily acknowledge that he was disappointed that the Dodgers traded him.
 
Would Have Signed Elsewhere
 Brooks liked the idea of playing at home, and that was the primary reason he signed with the Dodgers as a free agent a year ago. He could have had more money than the $6 million over three years the Dodgers gave him if he had decided to play somewhere else.
"If I had known a year ago the events of the weekend would take place, I would have signed elsewhere," said the 34-year-old Brooks. "I could've gone to Toronto, Atlanta, Pittsburgh or Detroit, but the money was not the most important thing. It never has been. Being happy is. There's not a price on happiness."
Happy or not, Brooks said: "By no means am I in a state of shock or devastated by all this. There seems to be the impression that I'm upset or I'm broken down by this, but I'm not. It's better to be in New York than other places. I'm going to a good team."
Brooks said it was obvious when the Dodgers signed Brett Butler as a free agent to play center field that one of the existing outfielders would be traded.
 
'Surprised and Disappointed'
 "I was surprised that it was me, surprised and disappointed," he said. "I had just gotten here, played for one year. I thought I had gotten along with my fellow teammates and everyone else, Also, I was a right-hand hitter and that's something I felt the team needed with all the left-handers they have. But somebody had to go and I was the odd man out."
When somebody raised economics as the reason Brooks, and not Kal Daniels, the left fielder, was traded, he didn't disagree.
"I'm sure it has something to do with it," he said. "I don't know how many dollars Bob Ojeda makes, but it probably has something to do with it. You had to think about it the way they were signing guys."
Brooks has a $2 million salary each of the next two years. Daniels is unsigned for 1991, but earned $600,000 this year. Ojeda's 1991 salary is $1.5 million. The Dodgers had been talking about trading Daniels for a left-handed relief pitcher, but they opted for a left-handed starting pitcher instead.
Now it's the Mets' turn to make decisions on a batting order and an outfield alignment. Asked where he thought he would bat, Brooks said, "I have no idea."
 
Batting Order Unsettled
 Bud Harrelson, the manager of the Mets, has said he will not determine a batting order until spring training, acknowledging that he has plenty of possibilities.
Probably the only set hitters are Coleman first, Kevin McReynolds fourth and Howard Johnson fifth. Brooks very likely would bat third or sixth. If Harrelson wants Tom Herr to bat second, someone -- Gregg Jefferies, Dave Magadan or Brooks -- would have to bat seventh. It probably would not be Brooks because, with Charlie O'Brien, the catcher, batting next, pitchers wouldn't give Brooks pitches to hit. Then for sure, he wouldn't be replacing Strawberry.
Brooks does know that he will replace Strawberry in right field. In the five weeks he and Strawberry were teammates with the Dodgers, Brooks never thought that he would play right and Strawberry center.
"Not for one minute did I believe it," Brooks said of the idea that Strawberry would be the center fielder. "I thought it was a ploy that management threw out for you guys."

Pete Carril And the Frog With Wings

BYLINE: By Ira Berkow

 BODY:
The two men had missed a turn on a New Jersey highway and were now late for the game. They had come down to Princeton University from New York to watch a basketball team coached by Pete Carril, who is to coaching what Peter Pan is to flying, David was to slingshots and Rudolph to reindeers.
 Princeton was playing Dartmouth, in an important Ivy League game, with a 7:30 P.M. tip-off, and the men arrived in the lobby of the Jadwin Gymnasium at about 7:45. As they hurried in, they heard several roars from the unseen crowd inside the arena. 
 "The game's over," said one of the men, Howard Garfinkel, the basketball camp owner.
 "Can't be over," said his companion, attending his first Pete Carril-coached game, "it just started."
 "I've seen Pete coach four thousand games," said Garfinkel, who might have been exaggerating by only some 3,900. "What's happening is, it's early in the game, Princeton's ahead, probably by about 8 or 10 points, and with Carril coaching they're going to keep this lead. Game's over."
Indeed, the score was 20-8, with some five minutes elapsed in the game. Dartmouth would never get closer than it was now, and lost by 20.
 This took place several years ago. But nothing has changed at Princeton. Carril, at age 60 and in his 24th season as head coach of Princeton, is still there. Princeton is still a small, but winning team, one that often forces bigger and beefier teams to become befuddled and sometimes collapse. The Tigers play basketball with such beauty and brains that watching them dig on defense, and on offense, screen and weave and cut and suddenly find the open man for an easy layup is not only eye-opening, but nearly uplifting, too.
 Princeton almost upset Arkansas in the Midwest regionals of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament last season, losing to the eventual Final Four team, 68-64. The year before, in the East Regionals, Princeton, seeded 16th, lost to Georgetown, top-seeded, 50-49.
 On Saturday afternoon, Princeton walloped rugged Rutgers, 58-45, to bring its record to 7-0 this season. On Wednesday, the Tigers travel to the University of Nevada-Las Vegas to play the defending N.C.A.A. champion and the No. 1-ranked team in the country. The only other time these two teams met was in the 1984 N.C.A.A. Regionals. Princeton stayed close until the end, losing by 68-56.
 How does Carril do it, taking relatively ordinary students majoring in economics and political science and even literature, and turning them into a unit that combines certain qualities of a neighborhood bulldog with that of a former professor on campus, Dr. A. Einstein?
 "Nobody understands the system fully," said Kit Mueller, the senior center, "except for Coach and his assistant, Bill Carmody. But we do what he tells us, and it usually works out right. He's also tough, and we prepare well, so we're not intimidated by anyone."
 John Thompson 3d, son of the Georgetown coach, recently completed four years of play under Carril. In his first two years, he wasn't impressed with Carril, but he gained an appreciation for him in his last two years. It is like the Mark Twain line about leaving home when he was 17 because his father was so dumb, only to return four years later and discover how much his father had learned.
 John MacLeod, the new coach of the Knicks, said that his team must get back to fundamentals, to blocking out for rebounds, to even practicing the two-handed chest pass. Princeton teams do these things routinely, and their player-salary payroll is not $13.4 million, as it is for the Knicks.
 "I love watching Pete's teams play, the way they move the ball to get the high percentage shots, the way they shift on defense," said MacLeod, sounding nearly wistful.
On the bench, Carril, his gray hair ruffled, his tie loosened, exhorts his scholars to higher forms of the pick-and-roll.
 "You get a bunch of good kids and they play hard together," said Carril yesterday. "A jerk does what he wants. That's basically it. No big secrets. I just try to get kids who don't have those fighting egos that are flying all over the country today. My guys are reasonable people who respond to reasoning."
 As for reasoning, Bob Goldsholl, the astute sports broadcaster on WPIX, and a longtime friend of Carril's, recalled a conversation when a dean at Princeton asked the coach how his team would do in the coming season.
 "Pete, as usual, said they'd be lucky to win one game," Goldsholl recalled. "The dean said, 'C'mon, Pete, if this guy does this, and if that guy does that.' 'Dean,' interrupted Carril, 'if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his rear end on the rock.' "
 "It made sense," Goldsholl continued, "but you had to think about the idea for a moment."
 The dean did; so do Carril's basketball players.

HEADLINE: Now for a Drug Policy That Doesn't Do Harm

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Legal Crack? No Sale" (The Editorial Notebook, Nov. 25), David C. Anderson identifies me and William F. Buckley Jr. among a growing number of "responsible people" who advocate "legalizing" drugs. He goes on to say the critical question is "How would legal drug distribution work?" He ends: "Those who think it can work have a responsibility to explain how." He is almost right.
What unites those who oppose the current approach is not our belief in a particular form of legalized access to drugs, but our opposition to using the criminal law as the primary instrument for controlling the harmful effects drug use can have.
The use of the criminal law to reduce demand in the United States causes more harm than it prevents. It has led to increased homicides, particularly of bystanders. Children are being shot down in the streets and in their beds because they get in the way of drug dealers settling commercial disputes with automatic weapons.
Attempts to interdict foreign supplies often result in introducing more potent and more dangerous drugs, and enrich criminal cartels. The supply cannot be eradicated. We make things worse when we try.
Drug prohibition enriches criminals and creates an artificially inflated price that lures young people into the drug trade. Drug dealing is the major economic opportunity this country provides ghetto youth. How do we tell kids with no realistic economic opportunity, "just say no" to $300 or more a day? The money, not the drug, attracts many ambitious young people into a life of violence.
Drug prohibition has led to bans on the medical use of marijuana (for glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and the side effects of chemotherapy), even though the benefits are documented and the dangers nonexistent.
Drug prohibition also leads to bans on the distribution of clean needles to intravenous drug users. In the Netherlands, where clean needles are distributed by the Government, only 9 percent of intravenous drug users carry the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. In Liverpool, England, where medical clinics provide injectable drugs, the proportion of intravenous drug users with the AIDS virus is less than 1 percent. In the United States, it's 26 percent; in New York, more than 60 percent. Most of these are black or Hispanic. Our policy is racially genocidal.
Drug prohibition has inspired a Federal law that prohibits Medicaid reimbursement for treating pregnant women who use cocaine. When those women are turned away by hospitals and their babies are born drug positive, we try to imprison them.
Our criminal justice system is in permanent crisis, flooded with 1.2 million drug arrests a year. More than one-third involve marijuana, nearly 85 percent for mere possession. Trial courts are overwhelmed, prisons are bursting, and more young black men are in jail than in college.
Civil liberties are eroded. Urine testing of innocent employees is rampant; airport searches based on vague "drug-courier profiles" are increasing; homes are seized for a few marijuana plants cultivated for personal use. We have created a drug exception to the Constitution.
Drug prohibition aggravates, rather than ameliorates, the national drug problem. But when we try to discuss alternatives, official policy makers declare such discussion out of bounds. William Bennett refused to discuss or consider any approach that did not include criminal prohibition. In New York, Mayor David N. Dinkins instructed his study group on abuse not to entertain any legalization proposals. The California attorney general refused to publish the recommendations of his advisory panel to decriminalize drugs.
I have a very modest proposal:
(1) Repeal the Federal law that prohibits Medicaid from reimbursing
hospitals that provide drug treatment for pregnant women.
(2) Legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes.
(3) Stop enforcing the criminal laws against marijuana users.
(4) Repeal bans on providing intravenous drug users clean needles.
(5) Reverse Federal funding priorities, so that 70 percent of Federal funds are spent on treatment, education, prevention and research instead of law enforcement.
(6) Appoint a balanced, blue-ribbon national commission to study ways to regulate legal use and sale of drugs.
With few exceptions, no politician -- Federal, state or local -- would support these modest steps. Where are the politicians and editorialists with courage to advocate alternatives? How many more people have to suffer and die?

HEADLINE: New York City Is Just Adding to Vacant Stores

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You published a splendid study of emptied stores throughout Manhattan on Nov. 27. It is just as evident in the surrounding boroughs. New York City does nothing to preserve businesses, but seems actually to plague surviving businesses.
Last January, the new administration raised commercial real estate assessments 300 percent to 400 percent. When the State Legislature passed legislation to stymie those unjust increases, our new Mayor intervened and allegedly persuaded our Governor to veto that Friedman-Maltese bill.
Now, on Nov. 29, you tell a heart-rending story about a raid on 11 Bronx stores, led by a city sheriff and 25 deputies. They proudly hauled in more than $40,000 from those stores, which are struggling to survive. The invaders seized funds from the cash registers and bank accounts; most of it allegedly due because of summonses for loose litter dropped by pedestrians, who go unpunished. If a busy store is unable to answer these summonses, fines begin to accrue penalties and interest.
Thus, a city that doesn't sweep its streets, cleans up by sweeping the cash registers clean, adding more emptiness to sinking business communities.

Not all leading indicators, the bellwethers that economists use to forecast trends, involve sophisticated research. Consider this quick Christmas quiz:
What rarity can now be found on Central Park West at 8:30 on a weekday morning? A taxicab.
What's on sale for half price, more than a week before Christmas, at Lamston's in Union Square? Gift wrapping and ornaments.
What can you find in Macy's at noon on a weekday? A sales clerk, eager to help.
How much does it cost to buy the kind of Christmas tree that brought $40 last year on Greenwich Village streets? $25.
Is this what a recession feels like? Yes.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Point Man in Battle for G.O.P.'s Soul Doesn't Worry About Drawing Fire

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Jim Pinkerton folds his 6-foot 9-inch frame into a comfortable slouch on his office sofa, and explains why he is greedily consuming one after another ice-blue mentholated throat lozenge.
"I've been talking a lot," rasped the 32-year-old junior White House aide.
He is also being talked about.
Until recently, Mr. Pinkerton was best known for his beanpole build and the 1988 campaign research that helped turn Willie Horton into a household name. But in the last few weeks he has re-emerged from semiobscurity into the midst of a clamorous Republican battle over "the vision thing." 
 His version of vision carries the ungainly name, "The New Paradigm." For more than a year he had been plying it with evangelical but little noticed zeal, arguing that its reliance on the market and promise of decentralization can change the world.
Then Richard G. Darman, in his first foray out after the budget bloodletting, mocked the slogan in a biting speech. Major Republican conservatives, seizing the opportunity to attack the budget director who had helped bring President Bush to abandon the no-tax pledge, rallied to defense of Mr. Pinkerton, his paradigm and its promise of a post-New Deal new deal.
 
Great Republican Debate
 Suddenly, the Republican ranks seemed riven over whether George Bush is a New Paradigm President and the Republicans a New Paradigm party.
Is this a silly fight over semantics? Or, as Representative Richard A. Gephardt recently suggested, the assigning of a new name to the old Republican indifference?
Not in Mr. Pinkerton's view.
"It matters because it's shaping the Republican agenda for the next two years of George Bush's Presidency and arguably for the rest of the decade," he said. "It's not just a battle for the soul of the party but also for the soul of the country."
The fight is interesting not just for its passion, but also because it is one that Mr. Bush's flip-flop governing style invites. No one turned to talk of new paradigms in order to define what Ronald Reagan stood for.
Or as Mr. Pinkerton says in his New Paradigm speech: "Fighting taxes and Communists has brought us about as far as it can." To take the party further, he fills his speeches with new-day-is-dawning references lumping New Paradigm with world transformations like the fall of the Berlin wall.
 
Principles of New Paradigm
 In its specifics the New Paradigm is a set of five familiar principles: a reliance on decentralization, market forces, "empowering" the poor, individual choice and "an emphasis on what works."
Sometimes Mr. Pinkerton calls it a "nonbureaucratic idealism." Sometimes "politically correct capitalism." Sometimes "informed pragmatic idealism."
Translation?
Mr. Pinkerton points to education vouchers, home-ownership for the poor, enterprise zones, the earned-income tax credit and a capital gains cut as favorite New Paradigm causes, though he says he sees many other applications. Among the promises he says it holds is the opportunity to broaden the Republican electoral base by adopting Democratic social goals without abandoning traditional Republican economics.
Like the New Paradigm, Mr. Pinkerton himself can be hard to define. He is a friendly, earnest and self-effacing man who is affectionately described by friends as "goofy," and who once contemplated a career as a quiz show contestant. He punctuates conversations with references to Max Weber, Alvin Toffler and the movie "Rollerball." He urges the President to plant more trees.
Though he insists he is more interested in ideas than power, he is no political innocent. Now an inter-party diplomat busy organizing dinners with Democrats sympathetic to his ideas, he has built his career as an aide to Lee Atwater, the ailing chairman of the Republican National Committee. And though Mr. Pinkerton mourns a politics that is thin on new ideas, he also helped to create it, suggesting in the 1988 campaign not only that Mr. Bush seize on Willie Horton but also on the Pledge of Allegiance.
 
Of High Ground and Low
 Does Mr. Pinkerton have a dual legacy as a traveler on both the high ground in politics and the low?
"Inevitably, yes, and here I stand, warts and all," Mr. Pinkerton said, in a conscious echo of Cromwell. "There's some parts I'm prouder of than other parts."
Mr. Pinkerton now alternates between defending the use of Mr. Horton and apologizing for it. The result of its use against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential candidate, was a surge in the polls and the charge that the Bush campaign was playing racial politics by employing one of the most potent American psychosexual symbols. Mr. Horton, the furloughed murderer, is black and his rape victim is white.
Mr. Pinkerton says that Governor Dukakis's furlough policy in Massachusetts was a fair issue and that the Bush campaign itself never mentioned Mr. Horton's race. Mr. Pinkerton insists he never intended for Mr. Horton's race to become an issue.
While Mr. Pinkerton said he never thought it was certain that Mr. Horton would be used in racist ways -- "maybe that was naive," he said -- he now faults himself for running that risk. He says he should have found ways to discuss Mr. Dukakis's policy without focusing on Mr. Horton.
"I envisioned the possibility that it could play out this way," he said. "Others would jump on the issue, and others did, and use it in a racially divisive way.
"In some sense I'm responsible -- I won't try to evade that."
 
Formative Years
 If Mr. Pinkerton feels at home in conversations where ideas are swapped like Frisbees -- unconnected to immediate action -- it should come as no surprise; he grew up in a series of college towns -- Cambridge, Mass.; Boulder, Colo., and Evanston, Ill. -- where his mother, and later his stepfather, were professors. His father, also an academic, died when Mr. Pinkerton was 3.
Being the single child of a single woman helped promote a certain precociousness, as he was dragged to Bergman films and civil rights rallies at a young age. Although as a high school student he was drawn to George McGovern, he became impatient with what he saw as liberals' softness on Communism. Shortly after arriving at Stanford University in 1975, he was calling himself a libertarian.
Politics is the only profession he has known, first as a volunteer on the 1980 Reagan Presidential drive, then a junior White House researcher and later as an assistant to Mr. Atwater. Until recently, Mr. Pinkerton's tenure as a $77,500-a-year domestic policy aide had been a quiet one.
Conversations with Mr. Pinkerton about the paradigm can turn Jesuitical. Wouldn't it be a New Paradigm move, for instance, to require businesses to give their employees health insurance, since that would help "empower" them to work?
No: that would violate the principle of market autonomy. But he says that Congressional passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which guarantees the civil rights of the disabled, was classically New Paradigm since it "empowered" the disabled.
 
Pressed for Elaboration
 But didn't the measure force businesses to accommodate the handicapped? (Or, for that matter, isn't it an awful lot like plain old liberalism, which he holds in disdain?) No, he insists, and so the arguments go, inviting the suspicion that what's "New Paradigm" is to some degree simply those policies that Mr. Pinkerton happens to like.
Not so, he says, arguing that he has enumerated its principles. But he says he welcomes the dispute, insisting, "The most valuable thing is to get people to think about change."
Mr. Darman argued, persuasively to some, that the first four principles collapse into one and the fifth -- "whatever works" -- seems to vitiate them all. Among several reasons why the attack was puzzling is that Mr. Darman has said he supports the actual planks, like education vouchers and enterprise zones.
White House aides speculate that Mr. Darman was taking a swipe at Mr. Pinkerton because he suspected him as a source of anonymous press criticisms of Mr. Darman's role in the budget deal.
"I don't want to get into Darman at all," said Mr. Pinkerton, who said that more senior White House officials had told him not to comment. He said that he dropped off a note in Mr. Darman's office 10 days ago, suggesting that the two of them put the dispute behind them, and that Mr. Darman later stopped by his office, where they held a "correct" conversation for about 30 minutes.
Mr. Darman did not return telephone calls asking for his thoughts. As the President's aides parry and thrust about what Mr. Bush believes, the President has had little to say. One pictures him like Ward Cleaver, situated serenely in the family den, unaware that his boys are upstairs mixing test tubes of ideology that might blow out a White House window or two.
But is Mr. Bush, whose Presidency conjures to many the word "custodial" more easily than "innovative," a likely leader of the charge?
Though Mr. Pinkerton insists he serves "the first President to govern in the spirit of the New Paradigm," when asked for examples, his usually expressive face goes blank.
Civil rights for the disabled, he says.
And what else?
Mr. Pinkerton pauses and hunts down an April speech where the phrase "New Paradigm" fell from Presidential lips.
"I think the President's said enough about this to be properly credited with a significant role in this," he said, sounding more dutiful than convincing.
"I truly mean that.
"Sincerely."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Embassy Deputy in Iraq, Unschooled as Diplomat, Plays the Top U.S. Role

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, the United States deputy chief of mission here, Joseph C. Wilson 4th, received an urgent telephone call from the State Department informing him that "the balloon is going up -- this is no drill."
The Iraqis were preparing to fire, or had just fired, two Soviet-made Scud-B missiles, and Western intelligence feared that President Saddam Hussein was launching a strike either against the international force assembled in Saudi Arabia or against Israel. 
 As it turned out that first weekend in December, the Iraqis were simply conducting a test of their rocket forces.
In an interview inside the well-fortified United States Embassy in the Iraqi capital, Mr. Wilson, 41 years old, said that the missile firing was one of two moments in the last four and one half months that he has "faced down" his own mortality.
 
Palestine Guerrilla Incident
 The other, he said, was in August, when the Palestinian guerrilla leader, Abul Abbas, made public statements in Baghdad threatening to attack Americans and their interests everywhere in the region. The statements appeared to have official sanction from the Iraqi Government, which has provided safe haven to Mr. Abbas since his hijacking in October 1985 of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro.
Speaking of Mr. Abbas's threats, Mr. Wilson said, "We took it seriously and faced it down."
Mr. Wilson, a career diplomat for the last 15 years, regards his role in carrying out the day-to-day diplomacy of the United States in the Iraqi capital as an accident of history. He is neither an Arab specialist nor an experienced political officer. Rather, he has risen within the Foreign Service as an administrative officer, someone usually more concerned that the embassy heating and plumbing work than with what is going on in the host country.
 
Ambassador Was Absent
 The reason he was thrust into such prominence was that April C. Glaspie, the Ambassador, who is an Arabist and an experienced political officer, left for Washington the day before the Iraqi attack on Kuwait.
By many accounts in the Bush Administration, he has acquitted himself well in the difficult task of fighting the Iraqi Government first for an accounting of Americans taken hostage after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, and then for their release.
When the Iraqis allowed the first letters from hostages to their families, Mr. Wilson's cables to Washington describing in graphic detail the unsanitary conditions in which the hostages were being held motivated President Bush to speak out more forcefully against the Iraqis, an act that many hostages said led to improvements.
Already framed in Mr. Wilson's office is the Nov. 28 cable sent to him by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d conveying the personel message from President Bush that Mr. Wilson's diplomatic combat against Iraq was "truly inspiring" and urging him to "keep fighting the good fight."
 
Dissent on Hostages
 Mr. Wilson says he has also received messages from at least three Iraqi officials who disagreed with the hostage-taking policy saying that they understood the personal vehemence with which he pursued their freedom.
"A fair number of Iraqi security and foreign ministry people were berated by me on this issue," Mr. Wilson said. "However, it was very satisfying for me that on the day Saddam Hussein made the announcement that the hostages could go home, I had three separate phone calls from those in the Government who did not believe in the policy and who understood the role I had to play in being persistent."
Mr. Wilson is now preparing the embassy for the prospect that the last round of diplomacy between Iraq and the United States, which has yet to get started because of a dispute over dates, may fail and lead to war.
He said he has had no indication from Washington or from the embassies of other countries participating in the international coalition arrayed against Iraq that any nation intended to withdraw its diplomatic personnel from Baghdad should the threat of hostilities appear more certain.
 
Large Supply of Food
 The embassy has stocked a large supply of food since the crisis began, and Mr. Wilson said he believed he could operate the mission with a skeleten staff of five or six diplomats.
When he was posted to Baghdad in September 1988, Mr. Wilson was to be deputy to Ambassador Glaspie. But after she left, Mr. Wilson found himself in the center of the crisis.
On Aug. 6, as the first United States armed forces were on their way to Saudi Arabia at the request of King Fahd, Mr. Wilson was summoned to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry for what he assumed would be a stern encounter with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. Instead, he was ushered into the presence of Mr. Hussein, who at that moment had 120,000 troops in Kuwait.
 
A Startling Awakening
 This first meeting with Mr. Hussein after the invasion gave American officials a startling awakening to the challenge Mr. Hussein was laying down before the rest of the world.
In an hourlong lecture, Mr. Hussein told the American diplomat that Kuwait belonged to Iraq and there was no going back; he added that if Saudi Arabia, the United States or any of its allies in the region sought to cut off Iraq's oil export pipelines or wage economic warfare against him, he would consider such acts as declarations of war. He warned the United States not to confront Iraq militarily because United States public opinion could not tolerate the high casualties that Iraq would inflict on American forces.
"After about an hour or so, he asked me what I had to say," said Mr. Wilson, who added that he delivered a stern message that Iraq should quickly reopen Kuwait's borders and allow foreigners trapped there to leave.
 
Diplomat as Host
 As the hostage crisis and military confrontation have unfolded, Mr. Wilson and the embassy staff here have been host to dozens of American diplomats evacuated from Kuwait and other Americans seeking refuge from Iraqi hostage takers. Mr. Wilson and his staff have often worked around the clock to shepherd more than 2,500 Americans out of the country on evacuation flights.
His occasional fatalistic statements about living near ground zero prompted at least one American television correspondent to take fright and query her New York headquarters about increasing her life insurance coverage because Mr. Wilson had remarked that he had signed his will and paid up his coverage.
Mr. Wilson smiles now and says he heard about the correspondent's concerns from the Secretary of State's office, another indicator that his sudden notoriety has magnified his every comment as America's representative in Baghdad.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Time Is Money, And Other Things

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
"HUMAN time," suggest F. Thomas Juster and Frank Stafford, "is the fundamental scarce resource." The two University of Michigan economists have certainly invested a lot of their own in the subject. Their survey of this offbeat corner of economics, to be published in the Journal of Economic Literature, covers the findings of some 170 research projects.
Some of the survey is shoptalk, a rummage through the attic of the ivory tower. But a lot of what the researchers have uncovered should tickle just about anybody's curiosity.
 
 In poor agricultural societies, women far outwork their spouses. A 1981 study of Nepalese villages, for example, discovered that on average women put in 76 hours of work each week (more than half of it in housework) compared with just 53 hours for males. But in the really rich economies -- notably, Sweden and America -- men spend a slightly larger chunk of the day at labor than women, when both traditional housewives and women who work outside the home are included.
Why the difference? Culture, of course. But to economists "culture" seems more a label than an explanation, particularly since the gender-work relationship seems to hold across a wide range of societies. Mr. Juster and Mr. Stafford hypothesize that male leisure time in rural areas is actually spent planning and overseeing, while some represents a specialized "contingency resource" -- labor the village can draw on in emergencies.
A complementary explanation, one that belongs in the no-man's land between economics and more social sciences, is sexism. Modern economies are certainly familiar with the concept of interestgroup organization intended to subvert competitive outcomes. Perhaps men long ago learned to monopolize the best jobs, and have since been able to make it stick. Only in more industrialized societies has the male monopoly broken down.
Swedish men put in roughly the same number of hours at work (58 a week) as their male counterparts in Japan (56), Finland (58) and America (58). And they work fewers hours than Hungarians (64) and Soviet citizens (66). But a far larger proportion of their work time is spent on household (as contrasted to market) activities: American, Hungarian and Soviet men put in just 12 to 14 hours a week on housework, while Swedes acknowledge a full 18.
Market-minded economists (the only sort around these days) are charmed with this discovery because it seems to confirm the distortions they expect to find from high tax rates. Sweden's exceptionally high levies -- until this year, a whopping 88 percent in the top bracket -- push Swedesinto untaxed household labor. The numbers on home repairs, services that can be purchased in the market but carry no social stigma for men as household labor, seem to bear them out: In 1984 Swedish men spent an average of four hours a week on do-it-yourself home improvements, half again more time than American men who, on average, have far larger investments in housing.
None of this explains, though, why Japanese men put barely a quarter as much time in non-market work as their eqully taxed American counterparts. Facts can be an awful nuisance.
To hardly anyone's surprise, survey data show Japanese schoolchildren work much harder than Americans. Japanese high-schoolers spend 42 hours a week in class compared with the Americans' 26 hours. More dramatic yet, the Japanese put in an additional 19 hours a week studying outside the classroom, versus just four hours a week for the Americans. But some of the other differences in the way the children use their time are jolting.
The extra studying does not come at the expense of tube time -- the Japanese actually watch three hours more television each week. Nor does it come out of eating, personal care or reading for pleasure. But Japanese children hardly give the time of day to organized fun and games: sports absorb less than an hour a week of their time, compared with seven hours for the Americans. And Japanese children actually sleep seven fewer hours a week than their American counterparts.
Once they head off for college, however, most Japanese noses slip from the grindstone. Average hours spent on schoolwork fall from 60 a week to 41 -- fewer, most likely, than American university students. Indeed, college seems to be the one oasis of leisure in Japanese life.
Just why they allocate time this way is a mystery. But no greater a mystery, perhaps, than why American parents work long hours at everything except making their children work harder.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in Late Activity After Cut in Discount Rate

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell moderately against most foreign currencies yesterday after a flurry of late-afternoon trading prompted by a move by the Federal Reserve Board to lower its key bank lending rate.
Gold fell slightly in New York, down $1 an ounce, to $376.50, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. 
 Traders said that although the dollar fell, its decline was cushioned by the continued potential for a war in the Persian Gulf to disrupt foreign economies heavily dependent on imported oil.
Walter Simon, vice president at Bank Julius Baer & Company, said the drop would have been bigger in a "normal market."
The central bank lowered the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent. The rate is what the Fed charges member banks for loans. It also provides a guide to interest rates, since banks set loan rates above the discount rate.
The Fed move, which takes effect today, had been expected for some time. But traders took it as a further indication of the slumping American economy, which generally erodes the dollar's value against foreign currencies.
"This is displaying to the market the lack of confidence in the economy the Fed has," Mr. Simon said.
Traders said the dollar displayed its greatest weakness against the German mark amid rising interest rates in that country.
They speculated that some European economies might move to firm their interest rates to stabilize their currencies against the mark. This could further weaken the dollar.
The dollar closed at 1.4780 German marks in New York, down from 1.4870 late on Monday.
The dollar's decline on the Fed move came after an earlier report on the worst United States monthly trade deficit numbers in nearly three years. The trade deficit climbed to $11.61 billion in October, the biggest imbalance since February 1988.
It cost $1.9305 in New York to buy one British pound yesterday, unchanged from late on Monday.
Also in New York, the dollar weakened to close at 132.72 Japanese yen, down from 133.10 late on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Monday, included: 1.2667 Swiss francs, down from 1.2745; 5.0375 French francs, down from 5.0620; 1,118.00 Italian lire, down from 1,122.75, and 1.1554 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1579.
On the Comex, gold fell slightly, by $1 an ounce, to $376.50. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $375.75 an ounce, down 75 cents from late on Monday.

HEADLINE: Dow Jumps 33.41 After Cut in Discount Rate

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks rose sharply late yesterday in heavy trading, responding only seconds after the Federal Reserve Board slashed its interest rate on loans to banks, or the discount rate, to 6 1/2 from 7 percent.
"For about three minutes, buying exploded," said Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures trading for Shearson Lehman Brothers. "Then profit taking came in, because the news didn't exactly come as a big surprise. If we hadn't talked about it so much, the market would have gone up 100 points." 
 H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist for Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, said the move was an indication that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, "belatedly recognized that the economy is in a serious recession and he better do something about it."
Although it was the first cut in the rate in more than four years, its expectation had been widely credited with fueling the stock rally in the last three weeks. But until it came, at 3:25 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average had been marking time, rising barely 9 points in sluggish trading. Then the Dow jumped 28 more, falling back only slightly as many traders cashed in their chips to end the day at 2,626.73, up 33.41.
 
Volume Surges
 Trading volume surged to 176.5 million shares, from an anemic 118.6 million the day before, with 969 stocks ahead and 23 rising to 52-week highs, while 577 fell and 52 dropped to lows. The advance also extended across the Standard & Poor's 500 index, the Nasdaq composite average of over-the-counter stocks and to a lesser extent to the smaller stocks on the American Stock Exchange.
Despite nervousness over the Persian Gulf crisis and a rise in oil prices to $27.86, up 81 cents, transportation stocks showed strong gains. Bank stocks and other interest-sensitive stocks, including insurers and utilities, rose sharply on the rate cut in spite of new concerns over bank dividend payments. Drug stocks, chemicals and high-tech stocks also advanced broadly. Retailing and telephone stocks also rose.
Mr. Heinemann noted that since little lending was actually done at the discount rate, its importance was symbolic. But, he argued, "the move will trigger a cut in the prime rate, probably at once, and it will also signal that the Fed presumably will get around to putting some money into the banking system in the weeks ahead."
The cut in the discount rate, he predicted, will be accompanied in the next four to five months by further reductions in the Federal funds rate to "well under 6 percent." The rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, stood at 8 1/4 percent in January and has been gradually cut to about 7 1/2 percent.
 
Ending on a Selloff
 Explaining the slight selloff in the closing minutes, Mr. Grennan said, "December is one of the wackiest months because it's very choppy and investment managers make lots of adjustments as we come into the end of the year. They want their performance as of Dec. 31 to look as good as possible because they're going to live with it for the next 12 months."
Laszlo Birinyi, president of the research firm of Birinyi Associates, said: "Many of these stocks were strong before the Fed news -- like I.B.M., Compaq Computer, General Motors and UAL.
"The news basically broadened the rally and brought in some of the secondary and over-the-counter stocks."
Heavy program buying, including one wave beginning moments after the rate cut, lifted the Dow 31 points, the Birinyi firm computed.
In a strong high-tech group, I.B.M rose 2, to 113 1/2, on 1.6 million shares. Compaq rose 2 1/8, to 56 1/2; Digital Equipment 2 1/8, to 59 1/4, and on Nasdaq, Apple Computer 2 1/8, to 42 1/4. After saying it expected a sharp rise in profits for the fiscal quarter ended Dec. 28, AST Research jumped 5 1/2, to 32, in heavy trading.
 
High-Tech Stocks
 In other Nasdaq high-tech stocks, Sun Microsystems rose 1 5/8, to 22 5/8; Stratus Computer 1 1/8, to 21 7/8; Microsoft 1 1/4, to 75 1/4, and Novell 1 1/4, to 32 3/4.
G.M., a market leader, rose 1 1/4, to 35 1/8. UAL, with a proposed deal to buy Pan Am's routes to London, rose 2 7/8, to 108 1/4.
Manufacturers Hanover, which had been expected to cut its dividend, rose 1 7/8, to 20 7/8, after its quarterly payout remained unchanged at 82 cents.
Topping the Big Board's active list, Citicorp rose 3/4, to 14 1/8, after it slashed its dividend and said it would have a big fourth-quarter loss.
Bankers Trust New York rose 2 7/8, to 44 1/8, after it raised its dividend.
Among other interest-sensitive stocks, J. P. Morgan rose 2 7/8, to 44 5/8; Wells Fargo 2 5/8, to 57 3/4; Lincoln National 2 1/4, to 42; Cigna 2 1/8, to 41 1/2; General Electric 1 1/2, to 56 7/8, and Fannie Mae 1 1/2, to 35 1/8.
MBIA rose 1 1/8, to 27 3/4; Loews 1 7/8, to 97 1/4, and Primerica 1 1/4, to 23 1/4.
In the utilities, Commonweath Edison rose 1 1/8, to 35 1/2; Duke Power 7/8, to 31 3/4; I. E. Industries 1, to 27 1/2, and Montana Power 5/8, to 20 1/4.
In chemicals, Goodrich rose 1 3/4, to 40 5/8; Monsanto 1, to 48 7/8; Stepan 7/8, to 21; Du Pont 5/8, to 37 5/8, and Dow Chemical 5/8, to 47 5/8.

HEADLINE: Punjabis, Caught Between Sikh Rebels and New Delhi, Fear a Showdown

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHANDIGARH, India, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Over the last few days, on narrow roads that run between fields of golden mustard and emerald-green rice seedlings, convoys of army trucks, artillery and ambulances have been rumbling through Punjab, India's breadbasket.
To many Punjabis, the message is clear: a military showdown may be coming with militant Sikhs, another aggrieved and alienated minority in a nation already torn by Hindu-Muslim violence. 
 This week, the Government of Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar removed the civilian governor of the state, the third this year, and replaced him with a former army chief, Om Prakash Malhotra. With locally elected state government suspended since 1987, the Governor has almost unlimited powers.
"By putting a general in charge here while the army is being deployed makes us think there is some mischief in the minds of the Government," C. S. Sidhu, a leader of a Sikh political party under pressure from New Delhi and armed militants, said.
 
'Fear Psychosis' in Punjab
 But despite what Punjabis call "police raj" or armed rule in this state, where about 60 percent of the population is Sikh, thousands of people have died this year. A militant campaign of intimidation of state-government employees and the press is daily more audacious, officials are assassinated, criminal gangs flourish and, most wrenching to the hard-working Sikh community, Sikhs have begun killing each other as divisions among them deepen.
Up to 95 percent of the dead are Sikhs: militants, policemen, suspected informers and ordinary men, women and children.
"A fear psychosis has gripped the state in the last 10 days," said Jagjit Singh Aurora, a retired lieutenant general and critic of Government handling of Punjab. General Aurora, who heads a civil-rights group, the Sikh Forum, blames government officials and the militants, symbolized if not led by an underground organization called the Panthic Committtee.
"The villager doesn't want to get robbed and killed by militants or criminals," he said in an interview in his home in New Delhi on Friday. "But the villager is also getting robbed and killed by the police."
Further militarization of the state, he said, will only create "an actively hostile population."
 
Arms Cross Pakistan Border
 Sikh leaders say many families have already been alienated by offically sanctioned death squads and extortion by policemen who abduct young people and threaten to book them as terrorists if ransoms are not paid. Reports of torture and death in police custody are common.
The Indian Army is also fighting separatists in Kashmir, where there is a Muslim majority, and in the northeastern state of Assam, where there are cultural and ethnic grievances. Use of military force seems to have hardened rather that weakened resistance in rebellious states, yet succeeding Indian Governments have said that political issues can be addressed only when violent opposition has been put down.
In Punjab -- where in addition to religious differences, there are complaints that the state is denied its share of development revenues, power and water supplies -- the economic and political roots of the crisis will not be eliminated by force, say Sikh leaders here, in Amritsar, the holy city of the Sikhs, and in New Delhi, where many Sikh families from what is now Pakistan settled after the division of British India in 1947.
Those leaders question the Government's assertions that Pakistan, plotting to destabilize India, is to blame for militancy in the northwestern states. They do not deny that weapons are crossing the border, or that militants are going to Pakistan. But Sikhs say that those activities would be curtailed if demands for some autonomy were met and free elections were held to restore the democratic process.
 
Guns Trained on Shoppers
 The present worsening situation is encouraging Pakistani involvement, General Aurora said.
Indian officials say the army is being deployed in Punjab this week only for routine exercises along the Pakistani border, where troops will also block infiltration of arms and guerrillas. But a reporter saw army troops in jeeps, guns trained on shoppers and other pedestrians, patrolling the streets of the border city of Amritsar this weekend.
Hindus have been fleeing to the city from frontier villages, saying that they are being killed by militant Sikhs. In New Delhi, officials say orders to kill Hindus are emanating from Pakistan.
Sikh leaders dispute that. They say the attacks on Hindus may be politically motivated provocations intended to malign Sikhs and inflame Hindus elsewhere in India.
 
State That Once Was Quiet
 Reacting to Sikh doubts about the effects of a military response, Prime Minister Shekhar, a critic of an army attack on the Sikhs' Golden Temple in 1984, is trying to bring Sikh leaders into talks with the central Government.
Today, New Delhi announced that the head of the Punjab state police, K. P. S. Gill, was being removed. Simranjit Singh Mann, a former police official who now heads the largest faction of the Sikhs' traditional party, the Akali Dal, had made the removal of Mr. Gill a condition of negotiations.
But Mr. Gill will become director general of a national paramilitary organization called the Central Reserve Police Force, accused throughout India of brutality and corruption.
A decade ago, Punjab, a leader of India's agricultural and industrial revolutions, was largely a quiet, prosperous state. The Nihangs, a temple guardian sect, were the most warlike of the Sikhs, who follow a religion with Hindu and Muslim roots founded in the 16th century.
 
'84 Golden Temple Attack
 Proponents of Khalistan, an independent Sikh nation, were very few.
Then in June 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered a tank assault on the center of the Sikh religion, the 400-year-old Golden Temple in Amritsar, to dislodge an armed, radical Sikh faction led by a preacher, Sant Bhindranwale, whom she had earlier supported to weaken the Akali Dal, a mainstream political rival in Punjab to her Congress Party.
 
Taj Mahal Open Despite Curfew
 AGRA, India, Dec. 18 (AP) -- More than half the city that is home to the Taj Mahal was under curfew today after three days of riots by Hindus and Muslims, but the 17th-century architectural masterpiece reopened to tourists.
At least 11 people were killed and 49 wounded in Agra in riots that were the latest in a wave of clashes between to have swept several cities across India.
Residents stood watch on rooftops and alleys near the Taj Mahal, ready to sound alarms at the first sign of trouble. A curfew was in force in eight of Agra's 15 districts, the police said.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit of U.S. Worst in 2 1/2 Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The United States suffered the worst monthly trade deficit in two and a half years in October, an $11.6 billion imbalance that analysts said would make the early months of the recession worse than expected.
The Commerce Department attributed much of the 24 percent jump in the trade deficit to higher foreign oil prices stemming from the Persian Gulf crisis. But there was also a big rise in car imports. 
 The increase in car imports helped total imports jump to an all-time high and swamped a smaller rise in United States exports sales, which also hit a record high.
 
Bleak Forecasts Lowered
 The bad trade news prompted some economists to lower their already bleak forecasts for overall economic performance in the current October-December quarter.
Export growth and a narrowing trade deficit had been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise lackluster economy. Analysts said a rising trade deficit meant that even this source of strength would be removed in the final three months of the year, the period most forecasters pinpoint as the start of the recession.
"This is a bad number," David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said of the October trade deficit. "It suggests that we are not going to get as much help from net exports as we had hoped and it suggests there is more inventory out there than we had thought."
 
Decline Put at 3 1/2 Percent
 Mr. Wyss added that he had subtracted another half a percentage point from overall economic activity in the fourth quarter based on October's trade number, putting his forecast of a decline in the gross national product at a sharp 3 1/2 percent.
Analysts said the rise in imports at a time when consumer demand was falling suggested that retailers would be stuck with a lot of unwanted inventories, forcing production cutbacks in the months ahead. "That will tend to deepen the economic recession and add to layoffs," said Robert Brusca, chief economist of the Nikko Securities Company of New York.
Economists took more encouragement from today's report on consumer prices, which showed that inflation at the retail level rose at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in December after three months of much sharper increases. Energy prices, which had soared after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, posted only a small increase.
 
Maneuvering Room for Fed
 Economists said the reassuring inflation report gave the Federal Reserve the maneuvering room it needed to fight the economic slump with lower interest rates. The Fed this afternoon reduced the discount rate, the rate it charges banks for loans, to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent, the first change in that rate since February 1989.
About one-fifth of the deterioration in the trade deficit came from a 17 percent jump in America's oil bill in October, which climbed to $7.23 billion, the highest monthly total since April 1981. The volume of imports was little changed at 8.03 million barrels daily, but the average price for a barrel shot up by $4.73, to $29.04.
For October, imports rose by 12.2 percent, to an all-time high of $46.38 billion, while exports rose a smaller 8.6 percent, to a record $34.77 billion.
The trade gap, the difference between imports and exports, was at its highest level since a $12.56 billion deficit in February 1988.
 
Rebound From Low Car Imports
 Adding to the deficit in October was a 39 percent rise in imported cars, which climbed to $4.51 billion. Analysts said that represented a bounce back from unusually low car imports in previous months.
Through the first 10 months of 1990, the trade deficit was running at an annual rate of $103 billion, putting the country on track for its seventh consecutive year of deficits above $100 billion.
The big jump in car exports, many of them from Japan, lifted America's deficit with that country to $4.9 billion, the highest imbalance with Japan in the last 12 months.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aide Says Sudan Famine and Ban on Help Will Kill Thousands

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 18

 BODY:
An imminent famine in the Sudan and the Islamic Government's opposition to Western help have made it "all but certain" that hundreds of thousands of people will die of starvation in the Sudan next year, a senior United States official in that country has told Washington in a confidential cable.
It is too late to prevent many deaths, the official, Dr. Frederick E. Machmer Jr., director of the United States Agency for International Development in Khartoum, wrote in the message sent earlier this month. 
 The United States and the United Nations have suggested that the combination of drought, civil war and a Government that is bankrupt and ideologically driven indicate hard times to come in the Sudan. But the assessment by Dr. Machmer in his cable, was the most cataclysmic and specific so far.
"It is no longer a question of preventing deaths by starvation in the Sudan in 1991," Dr. Machmer told the State Department. "It is now a question of whether those deaths will number in the thousands, the tens of thousands, the hundreds of thousands, or even in the millions. I am willing to risk the point of view that, as of this date, it is all but certain that hundreds of thousands of innocent people in the Sudan are going to die of starvation in 1991."
 
Anti-Western Government
 The director said the hundreds of thousands would die "even if, repeat, even if the Government of the Sudan and all donors were to begin today working together with a maximum effort to address the situation."
Such predictions were almost unknown before the big famines in Ethiopia and the Sudan in 1984-85. There was less prior knowledge about crop patterns and harvests then, information that is now gathered from weather satellites and United Nations crop assessments.
Adding gloom to Dr. Machmer's analysis is the anti-Western nature of the Sudanese military Government, which has sided with Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis. While the Sudanese and Ethiopian Governments in 1984-85 were not cooperative toward Western efforts to overcome the needs of the hungry, officials say they were not as obstructionist as the Islamic Government now in power in Khartoum.
Dr. Machmer, the A.I.D. director in Khartoum since the beginning of the year, held the post in Ethiopia during the 1984-85 famine there.
 
'Rather Alarmist' Analysis
 But the director of Africa operations for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, Pierre Gasman, described Dr. Machmer's analysis as "rather alarmist." The Khartoum Government has stopped Mr. Gasman's organization from continuing its relief efforts in the Sudan.
"Deep down, from experience as old Africa hands, we are not as alarmist," Mr. Gasman said. "But we don't have the information -- either the hard information or the software that these guys have."
At a news conference in Nairobi Friday, Dr. Machmer said the food needs in the Sudan for next year were greater than the needs in Ethiopia in 1984-85, when according to estimates 250,000 to one million people died of hunger.
Dr. Machmer said he agreed with the estimate of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations that the Sudan needed 1.2 million tons of food for next year, all of which would have to be imported. About one-third of the Sudan's 24 million people will be in need of food rations in 1991, he said.
 
Food Transport Problems
 But, he said, given poor road conditions, lack of truck spare parts, disorganization and obstruction, that much food could not be moved into Port Sudan, unloaded, and trucked to areas in need.
American officials insisted that the Sudanese junta's sympathy to Iraq in the gulf crisis has not affected Washington's willingness to help civilians. But the anti-Western sentiments of the Government made it hard to get food in, the officials said.
The Government has long sought to keep aid from reaching the south, where support is strong for the rebels who are challenging the Government based in Khartoum. The People's Liberation Army rebels from the African and animist and Christian south have fought a long and draining civil war against the Government, based in the Arab and Muslim north. While famine was previously harsh in the south, the new threat is worse because the rains have also failed in the north.
American and other Western officials say the Government of Lieut. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir has confiscated food intended for southerners and bombed towns in the south while Red Cross and relief efforts were in progress.
 
Fear of Terrorist Attacks
 As another example of the inadequacy of relying on the Government to deliver Western food aid, American officials pointed to 19,000 tons of food that has disappeared since the World Food Program delivered it to Port Sudan last month. The officials said they believed some of it, but not much, had gone to civilians in the northern province of Kordofan, one of the hardest hit by drought.
Dr. Machmer recommended in his cable that the United States rely solely on nongovernmental Western humanitarian agencies to distribute the food, thus boycotting the Sudanese Government agencies. But American officials said that with the gulf crisis and the instability of the Sudanese Government, such agencies were having difficulty hiring people willing to work in the Sudan. Because of worry about terrorist attacks, United States Government officials may be evacuated from the Sudan in the coming weeks, several American officials said.
Washington has pledged 100,000 tons of food for next year, but stated that it expected the Khartoum Government to meet certain conditions. Those include a halt to bombings of civilian targets in the rebellious south, where Western donors are trying to deliver food through the United Nations. Washington has told the Government that it expects donated food to be delivered to people in the south as well as the north.

HEADLINE: SOCIAL SECURITY IS SHORT OF MONEY

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The Commissioner of Social Security said today that she would ask the White House and Congress for additional funds because the money provided in the recent budget agreement was not enough to operate the agency through the remaining nine months of the current fiscal year.
The Commissioner, Gwendolyn S. King, said she would ask the White House to release a "contingency reserve" of $146.4 million and was preparing a separate request to Congress for supplemental appropriations. 
 Her plans came to light as the Federal budget director, Richard G. Darman, notified more than 100 Government agencies of his preliminary decisions on their budget requests for the next fiscal year. In most cases, he allowed less than had been requested.
Cabinet officers and other agency administrators have until the end of this week to challenge those decisions. President Bush will send his 1992 budget to Congress in early February, eight months before the start of the fiscal year 1992.
 
Benefits Are Not Jeopardized
 Congress earmarked $4.2 billion to cover the administrative costs of Social Security in the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. But Mrs. King and other Social Security officials said the amount was not enough.
The shortage could adversely affect services to Social Security beneficiaries, but does not in any way jeopardize the benefits of people who are legally entitled to them. Benefit payments are not subject to the statutory limit on administrative expenses.
In a memorandum analyzing the problem, Janice L. Warden, Acting Deputy Commissioner of Social Security, said the spending limits set by Congress "will cause severe cutbacks to public service" provided by Social Security field offices.
"We project that field offices, teleservice centers and program service centers will run out of supplies by the middle of the fiscal year," she wrote.
 
Effect on Training Cited
 Ms. Warden warned the agency's central records office, which makes a permanent record of earnings for millions of American workers, "will run out of both office and computer supplies during the second quarter" of the fiscal year, from January through March 1991.
In addition, she said that as a result of budget constraints, "we will not be able to provide sufficient training to the technicians we will hire this year."
Even low-paid Social Security employees are now expected to work with computers, Ms. Warden said, adding, "We gain little advantage in hiring new staff if we cannot give them adequate training."
Peter C. Toland, manager of the Boston office of the Social Security Administration, said he shared Ms. Warden's concerns.
"From October through early December of this year we have not been able to order supplies like computer paper and forms for the filing of claims, except in real emergencies," said Mr. Toland, who is president of a national group representing Social Security field office managers.
 
Agency's Staff Cut by 21%
 The problems are exacerbated by the fact that the staff of the Social Security Administration has been cut by 21 percent, or 17,000 people, over the last six years, even as the number of beneficiaries was increasing.
Officials in the Bush Administration contend that Social Security employees, working with new computers, are more productive. But Mr. Toland said the personnel cuts "have resulted in reduced service to the public."
Mrs. King said the Administration would ask Congress for extra money to review claims filed by hundreds of thousands of poor children with severe physical and mental disabilities. The Supreme Court ruled in February that the Government had improperly denied benefits to such children, using eligibility criteria far stricter than those established by law.
"Readjudication of the children's disability cases will require a tremendous amount of additional resources," Mrs. King said. She did not specify the cost.
 
Claims for Jobless Benefits
 The Labor Department is also drafting plans for a supplemental budget request to cover administrative costs of the unemployment insurance program. Those costs have soared with the increase in claims for jobless benefits across the country.
Congress provided nearly $2 billion to operate unemployment insurance offices in the current fiscal year. Cheryl A. Templeman, a spokeswoman for the Interstate Conference of Employment Security Agencies, said at least $150 million more was needed to keep up with the increase in claims. The conference is composed of state officials who administer unemployment insurance laws.
Other Federal agencies are also considering supplemental budget requests. For example, Medicare officials said they did not have enough money to pay contractors who review claims filed by Medicare beneficiaries, doctors and hospitals.
Donald R. Cohodes, administrator of Federal programs at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said the 1991 budget for contractors was inadequate, in part because Medicare officials had underestimated the number of claims.
Without additional funds, he said, those who provide health care "will not be paid promptly for their Medicaid services" and "improper payments will inadvertently be made" from Medicare trust funds.

HEADLINE: In the U.S., Haitians Take Their Joy to the Streets

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
In the cramped Soleil Restaurant in Manhattan, behind steaming dishes of conch and red snapper and piles of rice and red beans, emotions soared yesterday as Haitians celebrated the victory of a man some called Haiti's Mandela or Martin Luther King Jr.
Taxi drivers, engineers, students, they pounded the tables of the restaurant at 10th Avenue and 57th Street, the din of their French and Creole drowning out the orders of some frustrated clients. 
 It was but a small slice of the fevered exultation among New York City's estimated 350,000 Haitians over the victory of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the priest who was elected President of Haiti on Sunday in the country's first democratic elections.
"He is defending the poor like Christ defended the poor," said Frantz Fequiere, 36 years old, a taxi driver who received a law degree in Haiti before coming to New York 10 years ago. "This is a day for jubilation. We finally have hope and we have shown that democracy can exist in Haiti."
 
'Pure Democracy at Work'
 At the next table, Joseph Saint-Hilaire, a Transit Authority engineer, described the election as proof that Haitians were capable of creating democracy on their own. "For us it is like a second independence," he said. "We have finally been able to see pure democracy at work."
Celebrations started on Sunday night along Eastern Parkway, a mostly Haitian area in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, which was cloaked with red and blue Haitian flags as people gathered to dance, drink and sing. In other Haitian neighborhoods on the East Coast the mood was also euphoric. In Little Haiti in Miami, thousands of cheering revelers improvised a vast street party.
Father Aristide, a 37-year-old Roman Catholic priest, is an advocate of liberation theology, a Latin American-based movement that holds that priests have a moral obligation to help the poor politically. This has won him wide support among the young and impoverished in Haiti.
In New York, whose Haitian population represents a cross-section of Haitian society, there was overwhelming support for Father Aristide, too.
"Haiti has reached a point where the country cannot be in any worse state," said Ricot Dupuy, program director of Radio Tropical, a 24-hour Haitian radio station that closely reported the elections. "Something has to be done that goes beyond the realm of traditional politics. The key to Aristide and his power is that he can talk to the people and they will listen."
 
Heavily Favored by Callers
 During the campaign, Radio Tropical, which did not back any candidate, dedicated its talk shows entirely to Haitian politics. Callers said they favored Father Aristide by a margin of 10 to 1, Mr. Dupuy said.
The greatest worry among Haitian expatriates is that the army may not remain on the sidelines until February, when Father Aristide will officially take over.
"Whenever there is a radical change, it will always scare people," said Joseph Etienne, director of the Haitian Centers Council in New York. "But we have a Consitution. This is not a revolution. Aristide has to abide by it."
The election campaign appears to have created some divisions among Haitian New Yorkers. One weekly newspaper, Haiti Progres, backed Father Aristide while another, Haiti Observateur, backed his closest rival, Marc L. Bazin, a former World Bank economist. Both papers have a circulation of more than 60,000.
 
Publisher Reports Threats
 Leo Joseph, publisher of Haiti Observateur, said that the election aroused strong emotions and that his newspaper had received threats.
"This is the first time I have seen the community so aggressive," Mr. Joseph said. "No doubt Aristide is a popular man. But we feel Aristide has a very violent language and he is a divisive influence in Haitian society. Promoting justice in his own camp may mean resorting to violence to settle certain scores."
Haiti Progres predicted the Aristide victory last Tuesday, George Honorat, a spokesman for the paper said.
He also said his circulation had significantly increased over the last few weeks. One of the paper's criticisms of Mr. Bazin was that he was linked too closely to other countries, in particular the United States. Many in the community agreed.
"Aristide is a very lucid politician," Mr. Dupuy said. "He won because he understood his candidacy was not challenged by the U.S. and he understood that the world is not what it used to be."
At Le Soleil Restaurant, Haitians recounted the history of their country and heatedly argued over what might happen after February. "We are at the crossraods of history," Franklin Pierre told Mr. Saint-Hilaire, jabbing him playfully in the arm. "But let's be realists. Haiti has many problems. We will contribute to change but it may not happen tomorrow."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Cut in Discount Rate Lifts Prices

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Although widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve Board's decision to cut its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 6 1/2 percent, was enthusiastically received in the credit markets yesterday. Treasury note and bond prices posted strong gains, and interest rates fell.
For the past few weeks analysts had been saying that the Fed would have to lower the discount rate, if only because the overnight Federal funds rate, the market rate the Fed most directly controls, was being moved steadily down toward 7 percent. Generally the funds rate trades at a higher level than the discount rate. 
 Indeed, in announcing the change the Fed said that one of the reasons for the cut was to realign the discount rate with other market rates.
But traders and analysts said the Fed's admission that the cut was being made against a background of "weakness in the economy, constraints on credit and slow growth in the monetary aggregates" was the real reason the market reacted so positively to the move.
The timing of the step -- as members of the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee were meeting in Washington -- was also seen as highly significant. Under Alan Greenspan, its chairman, the Fed has tended to move in a more deliberate fashion.
"The Fed is not panicking, but they have stepped on the accelerator," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "It means that another cut in the funds rate is a given, and that a move to 6.75 percent very soon is highly probable. The market got the message real fast."
 
Decline in Fed Funds Rate
 Indeed, shortly after the Fed's announcement the Fed funds rate fell to 7 percent, where it stayed much of the rest of the day. Analysts said they expected to see confirmation today from the Fed that it has endorsed a further quarter-point cut in the funds rate, which since early December has been trading around a target level of 7 1/4 percent.
If the Fed validates a drop to 7 percent, it will mean it has lowered the closely monitored rate by a full percentage point in less than two months.
Analysts said the cut in the discount rate sent a clear message to commercial banks that it was time to lower their prime lending rate. A few institutions lowered the prime to 9 3/4 percent earlier this month, and Norwest Bank in Minneapolis announced late yesterday that it would cut its prime to that level, effective today. But virtually all other banks have kept the prime at 10 percent for nearly a year.
"A cut in the discount rate is purely symbolic," said Darwin L. Beck, a money market economist at the First Boston Corporation. "But it is one that may get the banks' attention."
Analysts noted with satisfaction that bond yields, which had fallen during early trading, moved even lower on the discount rate news.
Bond traders often do not like the inflationary implications of a drop in the discount rate, and respond by selling long-term securities.
"The Fed took a risk, and the market has given the Fed this round," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. "There is no hint of an inflation revolt in the bond market."
 
30-Year Bond Offering
 By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 107 14/32, up more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.07 percent.
A report that showed the Consumer Price Index rose by a modest three-tenths of a percentage point in November helped send up bond prices early in the session. So too did an unidentified buyer, believed to be Japanese, who openly purchased more than $1 billion worth of bonds.
Treasury note prices posted strong gains, and short-term bill rates fell sharply.
By late in the day, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 5/ 32, up 7/8 point, to yield 7.88 percent. And the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes rose by 10/32, to a price of 100 15/32, to yield 7.11 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury bills, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.59 percent, down 15 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 6.57 percent.
Response to the Fed's move in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was more muted than in the Treasury market.
Traders said that prices of most corporate bonds rose by about 1/2 point. Activity in Citicorp securities was very light, with little change in prices, the traders added. Citicorp announced yesterday that it would have losses of $300 million to $400 million in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Hospital, Family Doctor and Benefactor

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The procedure was a spinal tap, and Eldris Green stared intently as the doctors behind the glass window at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center plunged a needle into the spine of a tiny baby. Other students wriggled uncomfortably, but Eldris did not flinch. She was born at the hospital, lives a few blocks away and will have a summer job there this year. She may well work there full time when she grows up.
Eldris, 15 years old, was one of 50 ninth graders from the nearby Taft High School who visit the hospital once a week to learn -- early -- about health care careers. In today's bureaucratic jargon, that kind of recruiting of inner-city youth is called "mentoring," but it harks back to old-fashioned patronage.
 
$200 Million Renovation
 If that insular, seven-square-mile section of the South Bronx can be viewed as a small town, then it is a company town, and Bronx-Lebanon is the company. Its two towering complexes, one on the Grand Concourse, the other a mile away on Fulton Avenue, straddle the nation's poorest Congressional district -- an area of the South Bronx where the median income is well below the poverty line and there are more abandoned buildings than trees, more storefront churches than stores or churches. The hospital is the largest private employer in the South Bronx. Almost by default, it also provides its community with drug-addiction treatment, half-way houses, social welfare services, housing, job training, counseling and health education. 
 At dusk, the streets empty and the hospital waiting rooms fill with people who have no family doctor or insurance or, more simply, no other place to go. It's the kind of community where only crack houses and the hospital's emergency room operate 24 hours a day.
More than 70 percent of the hospital's 3,200 employees live in the immediate area, just about everyone except the doctors. "We're not just a hospital," said Miguel A. Fuentes, the president of the hospital. "We are an economic anchor in the South Bronx."
Bronx-Lebanon is a private nonprofit hospital that accepts patients regardless of their ability to pay and that almost went bankrupt in the early 1980's treating its increasingly indigent clientele. Rescued by an influx of special funds earmarked for "financially distressed hospitals," Bronx-Lebanon is now solvent and undergoing a state-financed $200 millionrenovation and expansion that will increase its bed capacity from 574 to 677 -- government money given with the understanding that the hospital provides more to the community than just medical services.
Health care, Borough President Fernando Ferrer said, is "the Bronx's single largest industry," and Bronx-Lebanon, in particular, illustrates the grim paradox that rules many inner cities: illness is the community's greatest blight, and it is also its chief economic linchpin.
"Here, health care will always need employees," said Margaret Hutton, 38, who has worked as an emergency room nurse for the last 10 years and watched the patient population grow -- and grow ever younger and sicker. Her husband also works there, as a lab technician. "The hospital," she said, "is the only place where jobs are secure." She said she hoped and expected her that her 12-year-old daughter would work in pediatrics there some day.
 
'Accepted the Responsibility'
 "The only good thing that has come out of our AIDS epidemic is that it has channeled money into this community," said Dr. Jerome Ernst, an AIDS researcher and clinician who says 20 percent of the hospital's patients under 40 are HIV infected. "The hospital has given us the money; it's not afraid of being branded as an AIDS hospital. They have accepted the responsibility -- that's why I am still here."
Bronx-Lebanon employs 200 attending physicians and 120 full-time social workers -- more than 40 of those work exclusively with HIV-infected patients who even after they leave need help filling Medicaid claims, finding child care, housing, clothing or even a meal. Last month the hospital distributed 100,000 pounds of food.
The hospital, which is a partner with three local community groups and coalitions in an effort to build new housing in the area, is simultaneously spilling out onto the surrounding streets and drawing outsiders within its walls: the office of Community Board 4 is in one of the Grand Concourse buildings, and in January Community Board 3 plans to move into an office in the Fulton division. Bronx-Lebanon, which employs 114 guards, recently set up its own 24-hour security station a block away from the hospital -- in a sense, helping to police its own neighborhood.
 
Urban Enterprise Zone
 Particularly in the Fulton division, the part of the hospital that fills two blocks on Fulton Avenue, an area far from the epicenter of Bronx "revitalization," the main signs of vitality are hospital construction sites: there, across the street from the pre-World War I building is a new pink and white granite almost-completed 240-bed nursing home. Half of the new building will be reserved for AIDS patients, and it will be the city's first free-standing AIDS nursing home. In the neighborhood, it is viewed as a kind of urban enterprise zone.
The ill worry more about services than jobs."They fixed it up real nice," said Carmen Gearhart, 25, of the renovated waiting area of the emergency room, "but the service is still so slow."
 
No Other Doctor
 Mrs. Gearhart, who had carried her feverish 9-month-old boy into the Grand Concourse emergency room at 9 A.M., was still there, waiting for blood test results, at 6 P.M. Overcrowding, a shortage of beds and long waits are endemic at Bronx-Lebanon. "Our patients don't have a family doctor, whatever problem they have," explained Dr. Luis Maceira, an emergency room physician. "They have to come to the hospital instead."
Unlike most of the other doctors, Dr. Maceira, 44, does not commute to Bronx-Lebanon from the suburbs. He was raised in the South Bronx and left high school in the 10th grade to become an Air Force mechanic in Vietnam. When he returned, many of his neighborhood friends worked in the hospital, and he first considered becoming a nurse or an X-ray technician. But he discovered those fields had three-year waiting lists. Almost by default, he became a doctor, starting medical school at the age of 31. He decided to stay in the South Bronx, he says, to "help the community" and also because "all my friends are from the area."
Bronx-Lebanon is not very well known outside the Bronx. As Judy Turnock, a community organizer put it, "This is a community hospital -- the Shah of Iran doesn't come here for heart surgery." But for those who live in the area, it is one constant in a neighborhood that keeps changing and rarely for the better. "Our care can't be that bad," Mrs. Hutton said with a laugh. "We employees all say we would never go there as patients, but as soon as we get sick, we go to Bronx-Lebanon."

HEADLINE: Global Markets Lure 'Baby Bells'

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The regional Bell telephone companies are moving aggressively into foreign countries, eager to enter profitable businesses from which they are barred in the United States and to gain access to markets that have room for growth.
Earlier this month the Government of Mexico announced its intention to sell a controlling interest in Telefonos de Mexico to a consortium that includes the Southwestern Bell Corporation for $1.76 billion. In September, the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Ameritech teamed up to buy New Zealand's telephone company for $2.4 billion. 
 At least nine governments are seriously weighing plans to put their state-owned telephone companies up for sale in the months ahead and others may follow. They are Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Uruguay and Venezuela. Australia plans to sell its satellite company and to license the new owners to compete with the existing telephone company.
Meanwhile, countries including Britain, Czechoslovakia, Israel and Poland are auctioning off franchises for cellular systems, paging services and cable television.
Among the ventures announced so far: Pacific Telesis is part of a consortium building a cellular system in Germany; U S West and Bell Atlantic are building a cellular system in Czechoslovakia; Southwestern Bell has acquired stakes in cable television franchises in Britain and Israel, and BellSouth is weighing a bid to buy Puerto Rico's telephone company.
Because Puerto Rico is a United States commonwealth, a Bell Company would be subject to the same regulatory restrictions that Bell companies face in this country if it buys the state-owned phone company, .
Perhaps most alluring to the Bells, many of these governments are dangling the prospect of regulatory control less restrictive than that imposed on them in the United States. The Bells are barred in this country from providing long-distance service and cable television, as well as from owning information services and manufacturing equipment. As a result, they remain largely confined to the local telephone business, which is stable and profitable but grows only about 4 percent a year.
"The most important driving force for the companies is the total conviction that the internal market in the United States can't grow as fast as the international market," said Andres Bande, president of Ameritech International, the international subsidiary of the American Information Technologies Corporation. "They realize that they need to expand internationally and to diversify."
But the proposed deals vary enormously, and present a host of political and economic uncertainties. Will the host governments remain as friendly as they are today, or will they see the foreign-dominated telephone companies as an easy political target for stiff taxation and even nationalization? Can the Bell companies turn a profit in countries where the telephone system must be overhauled almost entirely? Will governments in countries suffering from periodic bouts of hyperinflation let the telephone companies raise their rates enough to keep pace?
"Investment in a basic industry like telephones is analogous to investment in a basic industry like oil," said Thomas Gage, a management consultant in McLean, Va., with a large practice in telecommunications. He cited American oil companies that invested abroad in the 1970's. "You can see that all kinds of things can happen," he said. "You can be taxed very heavily. You can be restricted in your activities. You can be required to invest in collateral areas that add to the public good but don't add to earnings. And then there is the long-term risk: How do you get out? Is this a perpetual deal?"
The Bell companies are acutely aware of these issues, and are trying to pick their targets carefully. Although the bidding has been intense on the comparatively small deals involving cellular franchises, the few big deals thus far have not attracted a feeding frenzy among buyers. Still, at least some of the Bell companies view the wave of privatizations as the hottest development in their industry.
"People have become aware that they don't have to wait five minutes for a telephone connections," said Raymond W. Smith, chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic. "It's this dissatisfaction with service that they now have, and the recognition that it can be much better, that have converged to drive the trend toward privatization."
 
Logic Is Clear
 It is still too early to know whether the Bells' new ventures will turn out to be successful, but the logic and in some cases the perils are already quite clear. Of the recent Mexican and New Zealand deals, each holds an entirely different allure.
Telecom New Zealand has a relatively high household penetration and earned profits of $148 million last year. Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, which will be allowed to provide local, long-distance and international telephone service as well as cellular and paging services, hope to increase earnings by cutting costs and by introducing an array of data-communications and information services.
Under terms of the deal, the company cannot raise rates for residential telephone service by more than the rate of inflation. But, in sharp contrast to the United States, the company faces almost no restrictions on rates for business customers and is free to assemble innovative packages of local, long-distance and even data-base services.
 
The Mexican Deal
 In the Mexican deal, Southwestern Bell and its partners must contend with one of the most antiquated systems in Latin America. Telephone service reaches only one in 17 households, and people who do have phones must often wait several minutes for a dial tone. By the same token, the country constitutes a huge opportunity for expansion and investment in basic telephone service. The new owners of Telmex will be able to provide local and long-distance service, without the restrictions that would be imposed in this country.
Daniel P. Reingold, a telecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company, said that earnings from Telecom New Zealand are expected to climb 15 to 20 percent a year, and add slightly less than 1 percent a year to the earnings growth of both Bell Atlantic and Ameritech. For 1991, he said, that translates into total earnings of $1.3 billion for Ameritch, an increase of 5.5 percent over 1990, and earnings of $1.5 billion for Bell Atlantic, an increase of 6.5 percent.
He said the impact of Southwestern Bell's interest in Telmex is expected to be negligible in 1991 and increase earnings growth by five-tenths of 1 percent in 1992.
 
Nynex Drops Out
 Despite the potential, the bidding for Telmex turned out to be quite subdued. A consortium formed by the Nynex Corporation, Bell Canada Enterprises and Casa de Bolsa Inverlat Associates, a Mexican investment banking firm, dropped out the day the bids were due. A Nynex spokesman would say only that "outstanding issues could not be resolved." Although several other Bell companies looked at the deal, only Southwestern Bell participated.
People who have looked at terms being imposed by the Mexican Government cite troubling concerns for any buyer, including questions about how much management control the new owners will have. Under the deal, the new owners will acquire 51 percent of the voting rights in the company, but only 20.4 percent of the shares.
A different set of worries derailed an attempt to buy part of Argentina's telephone system this year. Argentina had approved a $2.3 billion bid by a consortium organized by Manufacturers Hanover Trust. Under the proposed deal, Bell Atlantic was to manage the system as a hired contractor. Manufacturers Hanover had planned to put up $100 million in cash, and pay for the rest through an exchange of Argentine Government debt.
But the deal unraveled, largely because the bank was unable to persuade institutions holding the Argentine debt to exchange their notes for equity in the telephone company. Bell Atlantic officials attribute part of the impasse to a dispute with Argentine authorities over the ability to raise telephone rates -- a crucial issue in a country where inflation soared in the thousands of percent less than two years ago. According to a Bell Atlantic official, the American group wanted to tie telephone rates both to inflation and the exchange rate of the Argentine peso, but the Argentines insisted on linking it only to the inflation rate. On Oct. 5, the Argentine Government canceled its agreement with the consortium. One month later, it awarded the sale to a rival group headed by Morgan Guaranty Trust, France Telecom and STET S.p.A., the Italian telephone company.
The Argentine deal remains in dispute. Bell Atlantic and Manufacturers Hanover complain that the Argentines may have given the new consortium better terms than they received.

HEADLINE: BIGGEST U.S. BANK RETRENCHES AGAIN

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
For banks, the bad news keeps coming. Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, announced yesterday that because of rising problems with bad loans it would cut its stock dividend sharply and lay off 4,400 more workers. It has already cut its work force by 3,600 this year.
The bank's troubles, which Citicorp said would mean a quarterly loss of $300 million to $400 million, are the latest reminder of the increasingly harsh conditions facing banks. Three months ago Chase Manhattan and Chemical, two of Citicorp's New York rivals, also cut dividends, laid off workers, added to their cushions against bad loans and posted quarterly losses. 
 Citicorp did not say where the job cuts would be made or how many would be in the New York area.
"Citicorp certainly survives, but the question is, How will it succeed?" said Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, the Wall Street firm. "We are not optimistic about the economy, particularly in the Northeast. It is likely Citicorp will need further additions to reserves to reflect future deterioration" in the quality of its loans, he added.
Despite Citicorp's troubles, its stock jumped more than 5 percent yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, rising 75 cents a share, to $14.125, as the Federal Reserve acted to help the economy by cutting the rate it charges on loans to financial institutions, including banks.
Before yesterday's announcement, Citicorp had tried to handle its problems by cutting expenses, especially in its corporate lending offices in Europe and North America.
The company has so far avoided closing or selling significant parts of its highly profitable consumer banking business, which earns more than $1 billion annually, or the highly profitable parts of its global network of corporate lending offices outside of Europe and North America. It continues to have the largest international office network of any bank, though it is only the 10th-largest banking company in the world.
 
Deterioration Admitted
 Yesterday's announcement, which coincided with the end of a regular annual bank examination at Citibank, Citicorp's main subsidiary, was an admission that the company's problems had become worse. "Earlier this year, there was an air of almost defiance at Citicorp that they could cope with the problems by growing their way out of them," said James McDermott, president of the brokerage firm of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Continued problems with bad loans would be a further blow to Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed. After earning accolades for the development of Citicorp's highly profitable consumer business, Mr. Reed has seen his reputation sullied by the increases in bad loans and higher expenses.
In recent months, the nationwide real estate slump and rise in defaults on bank loans by developers have been augmented by a broad-based slowdown in the economy that is causing increasing problems with loans to consumers and other kinds of businesses. Loan defaults have caused about 800 banks to fail over the last four years, resulting in four consecutive years of losses for the Government-run bank deposit insurance fund, including a record shortfall of about $5 billiion expected this year.
While Federal regulators are trying to devise plans to raise more funds for the deposit insurance fund, the Federal Reserve yesterday took immediate action in cutting the discount rate. Banks borrow little from the Federal Reserve, but its action was another sign that short-term interest rates would continue to fall.
 
Shift by Regulators Cited
 "Regulators' attitudes have shifted from seeming indifference to banks' troubles to support for the industry," said Mr. McDermott of Keefe, Bruyette.
Because Citicorp, like some other large banks, operates with only about $4 of shareholder funds for every $100 of assets, an increase in loan defaults by only a percentage point or two is enough to create serious problems.
To create more of a cushion to absorb future losses and satisfy Federal regulators, Citicorp said it would reduce the shareholder dividend to 25 cents a quarter, down from 44.5 cents. Analysts assume the dividend cut was a result of prompting by regulators who were upset early this year when Citicorp increased its dividend, despite weak earnings.
Earlier this month Mr. Reed said reducing the dividend was an inefficent way of raising capital because the money saved was too little compared with the lower price the company would receive when it next tried to sell stock. The dividend cut could save up to $260 million annually, but the actual savings will be reduced by the amount that investors reinvest in new shares of stock.
In another move to strengthen its financial condition, Citicorp is expected to announce a special $200 million increase in earnings by an accounting change in the way it records gains and losses from interest rate and currency swaps.
A significant increase in Citicorp's capital is expected soon from a sale of about $1 billion of convertible preferred stock to investors in Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, Greece and Saudi Arabia. "I expect the earnings announcement will help clear the way for the completion of the private placement of convertible preferred stock," said Thomas Hanley, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
 
Savings of $800 Million
 The fourth-quarter loss at Citicorp results from the $300 million cost of reducing by 8,000 workers a staff that at the end of 1989 stood at 90,500. The company estimated that in 1992 the cut in jobs plus other savings would amount to $800 million. About $300 million of the reduced expenses will come from pulling out of or selling some businesses.
Another part of the loss comes from a $340 million increase, which is subtracted from profits, in the $4.062 billion of reserves Citicorp held for troubled loans at the end of the third quarter. That increase is far smaller than the $2 billion or more some analysts have said is needed to bring Citicorp's reserves into line with its $9.7 billion of delinquent or troubled loans, but much larger than the $95 million the company added to the reserve in the third quarter.
Citicorp did not disclose yesterday how many bad loans it expects to write off as a loss, or how many loans it expects to list in a troubled category where interest and principal payments are counted toward profits only as they are received, not as they accrue. Both items are needed by analysts trying to estimate the severity of Citicorp's loan problems.
Mr. Hanley of Salomon Brothers said that a modest increase in loan charge-offs, such as the $600 million to $650 million that company officials have indicated is likely, "leaves reason to worry that earnings will continue to be hurt" by continued charge-offs at a high level and large additions to funds held in reserve. But if a much larger amount than $600 million of loans are written off, "then Citicorp will have made a significant move toward purging itself of the problems," he added.

HEADLINE: M.I.T. Deal With Japan Stirs Fear on Competition

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has agreed to teach Japanese scientists how to replicate a laboratory in which researchers are developing futuristic entertainment and education products, touching off an intense debate over scholarship and high technology.
Under the agreement, the Japanese are about to begin an effort to duplicate the creative atmosphere of M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory, which computer experts say is probably the world's only lab in which young scientists are being encouraged to pursue their most creative ideas in merging computers, television and films.
Critics say the $10 million contract is a crass sale of expertise in one of the few areas of computer science in which the Japanese say they are lacking: the ability to build a creative environment to generate new ideas. The critics also say the agreement does not require the Japanese to publish all the results of their research, as M.I.T. does.
But others defend the agreement, saying it is dangerous even to think of taking a protectionist view toward science. They say the university and the world can only benefit by having a Japanese counterpart to the university's media laboratory.
 
Race for High-Definition TV
 The research being conducted in the lab offers America what the experts say is its greatest hope in the race with Japan to develop and market high-definition television. Researchers at the lab have also found ways to send movies over telephone lines, instead of over the airwaves or over cable lines, so that instead of going to a video rental store, people will be able to call a number and have a movie transmitted to their television sets.
The researchers have also developed a technique they call interactive television, which allows viewers to use a computer to tailor television shows to their liking, focusing on one item in a news show or selecting a camera angle for a sports event.
Japanese executives speak of products like these when they say they were motivated to buy American movie studios with a goal of merging the technologies of computers, television and films. Last month the Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company bought MCA, owner of Universal Studios, and last year the Sony Corporation bought Columbia Pictures.
Researchers at the media lab say science cannot be restricted by national boundaries. They say that the more media labs, and the more people thinking of such ideas, the better. But critics say the real question is what, besides money, the university and the United States get out of the deal.
 
2 Japanese Interests
 The agreement is between M.I.T. and two Japanese interests: Nihon University and the Japanese industrialist Chiyoji Misawa, a leading builder who is interested in futuristic homes in which computers will control various functions, including regulating temperature, turning lights on and off and opening blinds to let in the sun.
In the debate in the United States, the opposing positions are represented by Pat Choate, an economist who is concerned by Japan's success in acquiring American products, and Andrew Lippman, the associate director of M.I.T.'s media lab.
"Of course it will hurt us," said Dr. Choate. "This kind of knowledge is a major underpinning of our future."
But Dr. Lippman said he believed that the world and American science would be better off if more scientists learned the M.I.T. style. "Right now, it's unfortunate that the media lab is unique in the breadth and scope of what it's doing," he said. "More media labs can only be better."
 
Questions on Competitiveness
 Another critic, Dr. Amar Bose, teaches electrical engineering and computer science at M.I.T. He is also founder and director of the Bose Corporation of Framingham, Mass., which designs and produces high-fidelity equipment. "The Japanese recognize that what they are lacking is in the creative side," he said. "They have been unable to develop that side of their economy and they know their future depends on it. So does ours, by the way. They know exactly what they want and they're prepared to go out and buy it.
"If you ask whether this is going to diminish ultimately the U.S. competitive position, the answer is yes."
Seigi Hinata, a spokesman at the Japanese Consulate in New York, agreed that the Japanese were developing basic research. "Up to now Japan has excelled in applying results of European and U.S. basic research," Mr. Hinata said. "But now we are beginning to put an emphasis on producing world-class research that will break new ground."
While the agreement was actually reached in 1987, it has not been publicized, even within the university. And the Japanese officials involved in the project only recently obtained the building permits needed to start work on the media laboratory in Japan, although a small lab has been in operation so some research techniques could be learned.
 
Details on Contract
 M.I.T. officials say the university will get nothing tangible, other than the $10 million, and they acknowledge that the agreement does not require the Japanese to publish all their results. "I don't know if M.I.T. gets anything out of it other than money," said Dr. Kenneth A. Smith, vice president for research at the university.
But Dr. Smith cautioned that he was not certain that a media lab like M.I.T.'s could be transplanted.
Dr. Nicholas Negroponte, founder and director of the media lab, said that under the terms of the agreement he could not release a copy of the contract without permission from the Japanese. But he agreed in a recent interview to discuss the arrangement.
Dr. Negroponte said the Japanese would pay M.I.T. the $10 million over five years. The money will go into M.I.T.'s $1.6 billion endowment, but in an informal arrangement, the money will be used to support the media lab.
So far, as part of the agreement, three Japanese scientists have spent a year each at M.I.T., learning the culture of the media lab and how to run a lab like it. In addition, Dr. Negroponte said, virtually every one of the 19 professors at the M.I.T. lab has gone to Japan and looked in on what he said was the "small prototype" of the lab that was created while the Japanese waited for permission to build the real thing.
 
Future Help From M.I.T.
 Two graduates of the M.I.T. media lab were hired this year to help start the Japanese laboratory, which is to be built in Chiba prefecture east of Tokyo. Once the new lab opens, M.I.T. researchers and students will regularly spend time there, the agreement said.
M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory is a fairly new venture, having opened in 1985. Timothy Browne, who had worked for the lab and now manages an interactive television project for McCann-Erickson World Wide, an advertising agency, said the media lab is dissimilar to any Japanese lab. "There are a lot of wild kids who are given a lot of responsibility and authority," he said of the researchers. "Stereos are blaring and there is a lot of laughter. Japanese labs are considerably more serious, and the researchers themselves aren't given that kind of responsibility and authority."
Dr. Negroponte said it costs $10 million a year to operate the media lab and that $9 million of this was provided by the Federal Government and private companies. The Government pays about 30 percent, he said. About 15 percent of the corporate money is provided by Japanese firms under previous agreements, Dr. Negroponte said.
The $10 million that the Japanese agreed to pay under the new contract is enormously important as a source of funds, Dr. Negroponte said. Asked what else is in the arrangement for M.I.T., he replied, "You mean the money isn't enough?"
Some experts say they have mixed feelings about the agreement, adding that their reaction would be determined by what the United States got out of the deal.
 
A Two-Way Flow?
 "It's really a hard call," said Dr. Joseph Nye, the director of the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University. "The critical question is whether there is a two-way flow."
But others say that from what they have heard, M.I.T.'s agreement may seriously harm American competitiveness.
"The Japanese are moving toward the year 2000 to have a research and development capacity that is equal to or greater than that of the U.S.," Dr. Choate said. "The Japanese intend to dominate us."
Making their own version of the media lab "is an integral step," he added.
Dr. Choate said that the Japanese arrangement makes him question whether it is wise for industries to invest in M.I.T. "The fact that M.I.T. is peddling off its media lab should be of great concern," he said.
Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategies Institute, a research organization in Washington, said: "I can't imagine Japan doing a similar kind of deal. It seems to me that we typically undervalue what we have."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up by Modest 0.3%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose a modest three-tenths of 1 percent in November, less than half the torrid oil-driven pace set during the three months immediately after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Labor Department figures showed today.
The slowdown reflected both moderation in energy prices, which benefited from diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis instead of threats of force, and a general weakness in the economy. That weakness has tended to put downward pressure on the prices of some items while preventing higher prices for energy.
When food and energy are excluded, the Consumer Price Index rose by the same three-tenths of 1 percent as when these volatile items are included. The rise in so-called core inflation has now been three-tenths of 1 percent for three straight months.
 
Strange Behavior for Housing
 While the November increase was about as expected, many analysts had braced for an unpleasant surprise since the largest element of the price index, housing, has been behaving strangely of late and because last week's report on prices at the producer level was worse than expected. 
 The reassurance provided by the modest rise in the consumer index appeared to extend to the Federal Reserve, whose governors announced this afternoon a half-point cut, to 6 1/2 percent, in the discount rate, the rate charged financial institutions when they borrow at the central bank. This move came as the Fed's Open Market Committee concluded a meeting to establish the course of monetary policy until early February.
Today's cut in interest rates was aimed at arresting the decline of the nation's economy, which seems to face little immediate risk of resurgent inflation and therefore provided the Fed the maneuvering room to lower the discount rate.
"There has been no diffusion of higher energy prices into the structure of prices," said Jeffrey R. Leeds, an economist at Chemical Bank. He added that any inflation threat remained "very latent."
One inflation cloud, however, did loom larger today as the Government reported an increase in the nation's trade deficit for October that included a $5 billion jump in imports, about $1 billion of which was from the jump in the price of oil.
The dollar's extremely weak performance in world currency markets makes the situation even worse since it raises the price of imported goods, which thereby provide an unbrella under which domestic producers can raise their own prices.
 
Trend Called Troubling
 William T. Archey, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the October trade figures might be a fluke but added that "if they represent a trend, it is a troubling one as it would represent a major inflationary problem for the United States economy."
For now, however, the risks lie clearly with the slumping economy, not rising prices. Only one of the seven main consumer price categories, food and beverages, showed inflation quickening last month and this was mostly the result of higher prices for fruits and vegetables.
This 2.7 percent upturn and faster increases in the price of beef more than offset declines for poultry, dairy products and cereal and bakery products. Food prices climbed four-tenths of 1 percent after three straight months of rises of three-tenths.
 
Least Rise Since May
 The housing component, which accounts for 42 percent of the consumer index and includes fuel, utilities, furnishings and maintenance, rose by only two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the least since May and far less than the increases of five-tenths between June and October. The narrower shelter component had jumped at an annual rate of 10.5 percent for the three months ended in August but this rate has slipped to 1.4 percent for the latest three months.
Labor Department and other Government officials continue to seek an explanation for the midyear bulge in shelter costs, which has baffled private analysts as well. One theory is that landlords were raising rents to offset declining returns on real estate investments but evidence has not yet been found to support this.
Gasoline rose three-tenths of 1 percent following a 7.7 percent October jump. New cars rose for the second straight month -- 1991 models are higher priced even though they are not selling well -- but used cars again fell. Public transportation rose 2.6 percent last month, mostly because of a 3.6 percent increase in airline fares that have now risen 8.4 percent in the last three months.
Apparel prices posted a second straight drop of two-tenths of 1 percent, with declines widespread during the early Christmas shopping season for everything except men's clothing.
 
Services and Commodities Up
 Services, accounting for 55 percent of the price index, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in November while commodities, at 45 percent, rose two-tenths, the report also showed.
For the first 11 months of 1990 consumer inflation has run at a 6.4 percent annual rate, up from 4.6 percent for the similar 1989 period, with energy primarily responsible.
Among the five metropolitan areas for which price figures are published monthly, Chicago's rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent was the only large change. New York posted a one-tenth decline as shelter and clothing costs fell and food was unchanged.
Before rounding, the price index, which covers all urban consumers, rose 0.300750 percent in November, a rate that if maintained for 12 months and compounded would result in an annual inflation rate of 3.7 percent.
With the index now standing at 133.8, this means that a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in 1982-84 now costs $13.38.
The Labor Department also reported today that average weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation and seasonality, rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month after falling 2.2 percent in October.

HEADLINE: BUSH SAYS BUDGET MAY BAR A TAX CUT FOR CAPITAL GAINS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
President Bush suggested for the first time today that budget constraints would prevent him from proposing a cut in the capital gains tax next year.
"I haven't given up my philosophical commitment to the idea that capital gains would stimulate growth," the President said at a news conference with regional reporters. "But we're faced with this practical problem as to what we can do, not just on capital gains but on other stimulants that cost money." 
 Mr. Bush was badly bruised politically this year in his unsuccessful attempt to win a lower tax rate on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments like stocks, bonds and real estate. Democrats argued that the proposal would have benefited rich people for the most part, and they managed to portray the President as the patron of fat cats.
In an interview Monday evening, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said he was recommending against trying again for such a tax cut next year because he thought it would lead to a fight with Congress that the Administration could not win.
 
No More Discussions
 "Why would you get back into that discussion again?" Mr. Brady asked, asserting that the Democrats would demand "an enormous increase in income taxes" to offset the capital gains cut.
"I don't see any point in doing that," the Secretary said, "because the President won't raise taxes."
A failure by Mr. Bush to offer a capital gains proposal would surely disappoint conservatives who believe lower capital gains taxes are essential for economic recovery. Without the President's total commitment, such a measure has almost no chance of enactment.
Capital gains are now taxed at the same rate as other income like wages, salaries and dividends -- in most cases, 28 percent or 33 percent. The budget law enacted this fall would require the wealthiest taxpayers to pay 28 percent on capital gains but 31 percent on their other income.
Last year, the President proposed that 30 percent of all capital gains be excluded from taxation, the effect of which would have been a top capital gains rate of about 20 percent under either the old or new law.
The most powerful argument the Democrats had against that proposal was a table prepared by Congressional staff tax specialists showing that 66 percent of the benefits would go to taxpayers with incomes above $200,000 and that 83 percent would go to those with incomes above $100,000.
No one disputes that the direct beneficiaries of a lower capital gains tax would be the affluent, since they are mainly the ones who have investments to sell. But Mr. Bush and his top advisers have argued that the entire economy would benefit from a capital gains tax cut because that would encourage more investment and thus more jobs.
Now, the Administration is making a new argument, holding that the way the Democrats in Congress calculate, or in budget jargon "score," the distribution of the benefits among income groups is misguided. If it were calculated the right way, Administration officials argue, the richest taxpayers would appear to pay more taxes.
 
Rarely Discussed in Public
 Mr. Bush alluded to that argument at his news conference today. "What I'd love to think is that we could change the way we score it to a more realistic view," he said.
A dispute between Congress and the Administration over how to calculate the effects of a capital gains tax reduction has been going on behind the scenes since early in the Reagan years. But the facts are so arcane and the explanation is so complicated that it has rarely been discussed in public.
The decision by Administration officials to make a public issue of it now was interpreted by Democratic tax and budget experts on the staff of Congress as an effort to find a way to explain to conservative supporters why the President would be forced to back away from his campaign promise to press for a lower capital gains tax. The real reason, these staff members said, was that Mr. Bush did not want to fight another losing political battle on the issue.
The dispute over the calculations involves two related issues.
The first is the Administration's view, disputed in Congress, that a lower capital gains rate would actually raise revenue for the Government. No capital gains tax is paid until investments are sold. If a lower tax encouraged more people to sell more investments, the Administration's argument goes, the Government would receive more tax payments.
 
A Question With No Answer
 Congressional experts acknowledge that there would be more tax payments at first as people sold investments, but they maintain that in the long run the Government would lose money. This disagreement can never be resolved conclusively, since the decision to sell investments involves much more than the capital gains rate.
The second issue is whether the benefits to various income classes should be based on the amount of taxes paid or on the extent to which those paying the capital gains tax would be better off economically following a cut in its rate. The Administration bases its calculations on the former, while Congress uses the gauge of overall economic betterment. This is essentially a political question that has no right or wrong answer.
Economists disagree over which is the proper way to do it. Paradoxically, one of the foremost academic articles on the question was written almost three years ago by Lawrence B. Lindsey, then a professor at Harvard and now an assistant to President Bush on tax and economic matters.
Mr. Lindsey, who wrote the article with Jane G. Gravelle, the top tax scholar at the Library of Congress, came down on the side of the Congressional methodology. The article stated, "With a lower tax rate, these upper-income taxpayers are less burdened than they were before, even though they pay more taxes."
An economist for the House Ways and Means Committee put the argument this way: "What you're trying to drive at is the economic well-being of a group of people. The fact that they are selling more than they would otherwise tells me they're better off."
On the other hand, Administration experts make a powerful argument that even if rich people are better off with a lower capital gains rate, no one is worse off. Therefore, they say, it is wrong to imply, as the Congressional tables do, that poor and middle-class taxpayers would somehow be disadvantaged by lower capital gains rates.

HEADLINE: Educators See Need for Diversity on Campus, but Debate How to Achieve It

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's struggle to define its stand on awarding scholarships designated exclusively for certain racial or ethnic minorities has prompted a debate in the academic world.
When Michael L. Williams, head of the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights, originally ruled earlier this month that such scholarships were illegal, many educators, social commentators and philosophers were quick to express either delight or dismay. 
 But now that the Bush Administration has retreated from the policy, fewer of them were willing to discuss it directly. Instead, many preferred to move the discussion toward what they called the underlying issues, saying that these are too pervasive to be resolved by a single policy decision.
These issues, they said, include affirmative action, preferential treatment and the demands for racial and cultural diversity on college campuses in the 1990's.
In recent years, American colleges and universities have increased their academic and financial aid to racial and ethnic minorities who have historically lagged far behind whites in entering higher education. And in the 1980's as Federal grants began to be replaced by loans, many colleges eager to recruit more minority students began to compensate by offering scholarships to them, sometimes out of their own budgets.
 
Create 'Model Societies'
 Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, said the 815 institutions that belong to the association remain dedicated to finding ways for minority students to enter private colleges because society demands it.
He said that colleges have a larger responsibility than simply educating in the classroom, and that they must create "model societies by bringing together diverse people so that they may reason and learn how to live with each other."
Mr. Williams and many of his supporters have said that scholarships earmarked for minorities should be recast into financial aid based on need and be aimed at students from economically disadvantaged families. Many minority students would still be served by this approach, he suggested.
But a report prepared by the American Council on Education, a Washington-based higher education association, found that even among middle-income blacks and Hispanic Americans, there has been a severe decline in college entrance rates in the last few years.
 
Fewer Seeking Degrees
 By 1986, the report said, "the enrolled-in-college participation rate of middle-income African Americans had fallen to 36 percent, from 53 percent in 1976." Among Hispanic students, the rate was 46 percent in 1988, compared with 53 percent 13 years earlier.
More generally, the number of blacks, American Indians and Hispanic Americans obtaining bachelor's and master's degrees from 1985 to 1987 continued to show large declines, the report said. The report did not come to any conclusions as to why the declines occurred.
Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, said the statistics sketch a distressing vision of the future.
"You have an unhappy participation rate in the first place," he said. "You have a crying need for minorities in the labor force in the 10 years immediately ahead. And we know that that labor force is going to have a lot of jobs that require a post-secondary education."
That, he said, creates a powerful justification to continue to have effective programs to help minority members afford a college education.
The decision on minority scholarships has drawn more than criticism. There has also been passionate support.
On the NBC program "Today" yesterday, John Bunzel, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative research organization in California, argued forcefully with the president of Xavier University, Norman Francis, that scholarships based on an applicant's race undermine the nation's sense of equality.
 
Opened the Subject
 Thomas Sowell, author of "Preferential Policies: An International Perspective," wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Monday that the only people who would have been affected by Mr. Williams's decision would be "those few who are not, in fact, needy, but who are trading on color, surname or other ethnic indicators."
Whatever Mr. Williams's intentions, Mr. Sowell wrote, he has opened the subject of equal opportunity versus preferential treatment.
Shelby Steele, an English professor at San Jose State University who often writes about race and society, said, "In principle, it was a solid decision." But, he added, "it came out into a political atmosphere, which made it almost impossible to really look at the real issue."
In his collection of essays, "The Content of Our Character," Dr. Steele decribes his dilemma as a black college professor who has two sons who will soon be of college age.
"Their society now tells them that if they will only designate themselves as black on their college applications, they will likely do better in the college lottery then if they conceal this fact," he writes. "I think there is something of a Faustian bargain in this."
In an interview from his California office, Dr. Steele said the Education Department's initial decision tried to develop a policy that recognized a "color-blind society."
"In order to achieve a color-blind socity, both whites and blacks have to make sacrifices for fairness," he said. "If something is fair for one group it must be fair for others."
"If preferential treatment is correct, why not a David Duke Scholarship for poor Appalachian whites?" Dr. Steele asked. Mr. Duke, a State Representative in Louisiana, is a former Ku Klux Klan leader who lost a race for the United States Senate earlier this year.
 
What Is Diversity?
 Steven M. Cahn, provost and professor of philosophy at the Graduate School of the City University of New York, urged both sides to be more precise in their debate. He said terms like "diversity" needed to be more clearly defined.
"There are various respects in which students can be diverse," he said, including age, gender, race, religious affilation, economic class, military experience and sexual orientation.
"I think that when college classes are put together, when students are chosen, any or all of these might be what is meant by calling for diversity or pluralism," Dr. Cahn said.
While he said he believed diversity on campus was valuable, Dr. Cahn added: "I don't want to say the most important aspect of any person is that person's race. I think that is a fundamentally mistaken idea."
